B000N3ST9I|4.0|Well, the mainstream metal press is eating this up, and it appears that much of the public is too, but I'm not totally sold.  Yeah, it's a very solid album, perhaps the best yet from Machine Head, but I really don't see that's it's  altogether remarkable, and certainly not groundbreaking.  (Not that that's necessary for a great metal album.)  Still, it's more than worth a look for just about any metal fan.<br /><br />Several years back Machine Head hopped on the metalcore bandwagon, and they continue to ride that wagon with \\"The Blackening\\".  They've changed things up a bit still, though, and for the better.  It's definitely a bit more thrashy, more riff-oriented and far more epic, which I like, with 4 tracks between 9-10 minutes.  Furthermore, this album just has a rawness and an edge that's greater than what we've heard from them recently.  This is the second album with Flynn's old Vio-lence bandmate Phil Demmel backing him on guitar, (Vio-lence rules Machine Head, by the way) and they've both stepped it up here, with some better than usual solos and plenty of cool unison guitar lines. (And, still plenty of pounding riffs, though some of the groove ones still leave me a bit cold.)  They've got an absolutely brutal guitar tone here, something which makes them standout from most of the other thrashy, melodic metalcore bands in the market today.  Some bands that tune down this low lose some bite in the tone.  Not so here, no way.  The rhythm section is solid too, though it doesn't often draw attention to itself, which is perfectly alright, and Flynn's vox are competent with some occasionally pleasant hints of melody.  All in all, the pieces are all here, but occasionally the execution falters a bit.<br /><br />\\"The Blackening\\" is only 8 tracks long, which I like.  Precious few metal albums have 10 or more tracks and no filler.  Trouble is, \\"The Blackening\\" still isn't totally consistent.  Specifically, we've got \\"Wolves\\" and \\"Slanderous\\".  Neither or these are bad songs, by any means, but they're a tad too faceless for something with a mere 8 tracks.  \\"Wolves\\" is one of the epics, though it stands out from the others and most metal epics in that it has no real concessions to melody or mood; it's just 9 minutes of endless riffs.  Trouble is, these riffs aren't especially interesting, particularly the more groove-oriented ones.  It sounds fine, but if I'm  not specifically paying attention to it I barely even notice it.  \\"Slanderous\\" is a shorter rocker.  It's got a pretty solid main riff and generally strong guitarwork, but the chorus is pretty weak and again, it's just kinda there.  The other six tracks are very good to excellent, however.<br /><br />\\"The Blackening\\" is bookended by the two most epic tracks, the awkwardly titled \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\" at the beginning and \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" at the close.  The opener gives you a good sense of what's to come, with some of the strongest, thrashiest riffing on the album, solid lead work and some effective 'core styled vox.  Probably the strongest track on the album.  \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is a more balladish track, though it gets pretty intense at the end.  You've heard this kinda thing plenty of times before:  Slow, ethereal intro, an epic, melodic chorus and some more brute, wild guitarwork at the latter parts of the song.  An old pattern, but a good one and they use it well.  \\"Beautiful Mourning\\" is the second track, the shortest one but still a very solid piece.  It starts out a a pure rocker, but they integrate some melody nicely, and it proves to be quite a memorable song.  The Dimebag Darrell tribute \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" has some of the finest guitarwork on the album, though it kinda peters out at the end.  Still, they do rip it up on the guitars pretty nicely here.  \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" is one of those darker, slower and moodier tracks that inches towards ballad territory (though it's still very, very heavy much of the time..  The chorus is very memorable and ithas some of Flynn's best vox on the whole album.  Finally, we come to \\"Halo\\", another long one.  Much of the riffing in this song is a tad dubious, but it makes up for it with an outstanding dual lead middle sections and a very melodic, immediately memorable chorus.<br /><br />All in all, a good metal album, and an effective extension of the Machine Head sound.

Of course Joe Sample is an incredible piano player and Randy one of the most under rated vocalist of today.  But the combination of Joe's arrangements, Randy's incredible voice and these songs, wow!  I can't stop listening.  It leaves me \\"Feeling Good\\".

B000MTDRKE|5.0|I will not address the lyrical subject matter presented in this album, as that has already been done to death in hundreds of reviews. This review will be solely dedicated to the musical aspect of Sola Scriptura, so if you expect to find thoughts or comments on the lyrics, hit the back button now. However, this does not mean the lyrical message Morse conveys here is unimportant. On the contrary, it is very vital to his music, as this was the primary reason why he left Transatlantic and Spock's Beard, the band he'd carried to the top of prog rock in the late 90's. If the lyrics didn't mean so much to him, he wouldn't have left the Beard in the first place. If you disagree with his ideas, that's fine -- but don't take it out on him for expressing himself through his music. Besides, it is amusing how everyone gets so worked up about his lyrics once Neal's name is mentioned -- truly amazing.<br /><br />On the musical front, it has to be noted that Sola Scriptura does little to reinvent the wheel -- on the contrary, it mostly expands on the elements introduced on his previous works. It is a tad heavier though -- the addition of guitar god Paul Gilbert certainly shows. Gilbert not only inserts some amazing, jackhammer riffs into the epic-length songs, he also  plays several of his trademark solos, such as the bluesy part on \\"The Door\\", made up of several sub-parts, with an overwhelming symphonic aura sustained by grandiose arrangements and recurring melodies. The six-plus-minute intro of this song is among the heaviest moments you'll ever hear on a Neal Morse album -- hyperkinetic riffage, rising piano accents, and killer drumming by Mike Portnoy. He's given more space on this album than before and is unafraid to fill the piece with slaying drum fills and relentless double bass drum work. As usual, his tone is amazing and will make many drummers jealous. Complete with a middle-section that boasts blazing vintage synth leads and furious electric leads, the song also calms down with the inclusion of solemn acoustic passages driven by the amazing vocalizations of Neal Morse -- sort of like \\"Wind at My Back\\"  from Spock's Beard Snow. The amount of gospel-style female harmonies is kept to a minimum here, but when they are mixed into the main melody, they become sublime. By the end of the song, which is just shy off the 30-minute mark, it is just Morse and his repeating a little \\"chorus\\", rocking it into your soul -- he is still one of the greatest prog rock singers around. His knack for timeless harmonies remains unique and unrivaled.<br /><br />\\"The Conflict\\" starts with a shredding lead by Gilbert -- it's pure and it's crazy. This man has phenomenal talent. The song boasts a more hard rock vibe, notably in its visceral first half. Randy George pounds out walloping bass lines to underscore the violent wall-of-sound guitars and keyboards prior to the song's slowed-down acoustic bits, more gospel vocals, a touch of Latin, and sweet piano motif. It then builds to a big, exciting finale with more Beatles-like harmonies and crazy instrumental dexterity. The climax is kept until the final second -- first Morse harmonizes over his own vocal melody and then there is an arresting lead with a descending acoustic guitar in the background.<br /><br />\\"Heaven in My Heart\\" is a shorter piano ballad, complete with rousing strings and a steady drum beat. It is arguable whether this track could have been left off the album or whether it was included in order to reach the 75-minute playing time, but it certainly is no filler, if you are a fan of Morse's vocals. The last song, \\"The Conclusion\\", another epic, makes several nods to his past, like the drum solo that recalls Transatlantic's \\"Duel with the Devil\\". Actually, the rhythmically varied instrumental section is right up there with the finest moments captured on Transatlantic records, which is a great thing for sure. The counterpoint near the end is musical perfection -- conflicting emotions coming atyou from every corner highlighted by a strong guitar and keyboard aesthetic.<br /><br />Sola Scriptura is Morse's most high-energy work yet. It is one of the greatest prog albums of the year so far. Whether it will top his previous album ? remains to be seen.highlighted by a strong guitar and keyboard aesthetic.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. I would even go so far as to say it is the definitive version. The cast was superb, as well as the dialogue, cinematography and the execution of the story. The movie doesn't linger on Jane's childhood; instead, the first part focuses on the burgeoning relationship between Jane and Rochester. Initially, Ruth Wilson renders the character of Jane as emotionally-repressed, uttering monosyllabics like \\"Yes sir,\\" or \\"No sir.\\" But as her feelings for Rochester deepen she becomes bolder more loquacious. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which she makes an impassioned speech to Rochester about being treated as an equal. Toby Stephens played the moody, sardonic, Rochester masterfully. Moreover, he exposed his vulnerable side to Jane. The cinematography was beautiful; shots of Thornfield hall--forbidding and foreboding--contrasted sharply with the pastoral landscape surrounding it. Those familiar with the book or other movie adaptations will be spellbound by this version; for first-timers it will be a rare treat.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuar&oacute;n uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.<br /><br />The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.<br /><br />Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.<br /><br />Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended.

B00005QW5X|4.0|Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell) is a rocker. And she's got The Angry Inch beside her (and in her pants). As a young man, Hansel/Hedwig lived in East Berlin, right before The Wall came tumbling down. His sexual identity was always in question and when a cute, black, American soldier gives him a way out of the Eastern Bloc, Hedwig jumps on him (literally and figuratively). But he can't get to the other side of The Wall as a man, so an operation takes place to remove his vital functions below the waist ...if you get my meaning. Needless to say (if you pay attention to the title of the film), the surgery gets botched and leaves Hedwig with his \\"Angry Inch.\\"<br /><br />The anger is twofold. First is the failed operation; second is Hedwig's fury over stolen musical material by someone named Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Tommy is a rock-n-roll sensation, but it's all because of what Hedwig taught him in his early days. So Hedwig, in true b!tchy fashion, follows Tommy's rock tour around the world. But instead of playing in theaters and high end places, Hedwig and his Angry Inch band play at lowbrow restaurants, often to the dismay of its patrons who've simply come in to eat.<br /><br />Hedwig's decline into obscurity is well played by director/actor John Cameron Mitchell. The musical soundtrack is very well done and the catchy tunes will have most movie watchers tapping their toes along to the rockin' beats. That he also remains angry at some of his band members is quite funny, actually holding them hostage by keeping their passports hidden away.<br /><br />Revenge is the meal of the day as Hedwig finally meets up with Tommy again, eventually leading to Tommy's career demise and launching Hedwig into the spotlight. But is this what Hedwig really wanted? Not realizing the sacrifices she'd have to make, Hedwig decides to re-open her/his closet and show the world his/her true identity. He also sets free one of his band members who turns out to be a woman masquerading as a man, too.<br /><br />Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up. It's quite funny, well acted, and has a rippingly good soundtrack. But if you're a staunch conservative or -- god forbid -- homophobic, you might want to pass on this one.ading as a man, too.  <br /> <br />Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up.

0765348780|1.0|I could forgive this book for being incomprehensible and tedious if it was at all colorful or had at least one character you could care about. Erikson's writing is dry and dull.  His descriptions are nonexistent and his characters are lifeless.  The names he uses sound clunky and awkward for the most part, like typical names from your teenage D&D campaign.    The Malazan books, like most popular fantasy series today, seem to me to be the work of obsessive compulsive former D&D players driven by inner demons and a hollow yearning for their former D&D groups, to write and write and write endless labyrinthine books with no regard for entertaining their audience.  I read fantasy books to enter vivid magical worlds and be swept away for a few hours, not as a sleep aid.    You can get a better, richer fantasy fix from any 20 page short story by Robert E. Howard, Fritz Lieber or Jack Vance than you can from the entire Marzipan Book of the Swollen.    I can only conclude that the legions of Erikson admirers have never read any real fantasy.  The 'state of the art' for some years has been the likes of Goodkind and Jordan, so perhaps Erikson looks good by comparison.
B000NA2776|4.0|Mika, with his first album, has naturally drawn comparisons to a certain other classically trained, flamboyent Brit with middle-eastern roots and rangy vocals, but to pidgeon-hole him as the next Freddie Mercury wouldn't quite describe his cheeky yet earnest debut album--probably one of the best so far this year. The Beirut-born and UK-bred Mika combines Mercury's flair for all things over-the-top (and shares many of his vocal qualities) with Elton John's talent for catchy piano melodies and the BeeGee's peppy falsettoes. Mika's penchant for cavity-inducing bubblegum pop pulls the album together in a way that is much greater than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />The album's highlights include the fantastic \\"Grace Kelly\\" in which Mika channels the late Freddie Mercury (who he even gives a little shout-out to), the catchy and buzz-inducing \\"Love Today\\", \\"Stuck in the Middle\\", and \\"Happy Ending\\" in which Mika truly showcases his hauntingly beautiful falsetto. Like any album, this one does have a few missteps--\\"Big Girl\\" is too obviously a tribute to Queen to stand on its own as a great song, and \\"My Interpretation\\", though a good song, seems too radio-friendly compared with the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />Whether Mika's debut will succeed in the U.S. is questionable. His song \\"Love Today\\" is already recognizable from a cell-phone commercial, but the acceptance of anything other than mainstream music is more or less dependent on how much media and blog attention the album gets. \\"Grace Kelly\\" and \\"My Interpretation\\" even more so seem ripe for radio play, so for now I'm waiting with fingers crossed to see this promising new artist find fame. <br /> <br />Overall, Mika has produced an astounding debut album that demands repeated listening. I look forward to seeing him develop as an artist over the next few years. <br />
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I find that as I get older I get harder to impress but I was pleasantly surprised by Casino Royale. Here we see an impetuous, less refined James Bond, who actually makes mistakes! Gone is the smooth talking, cool and competent in every situation, ultra-chic James Bond we've seen in virtually every other Bond flick. Gone are the gadgetry (There is no Q!), womanizing and even the car chases!(there is one very short one) There is no megalomaniac trying to enslave the world, the central villian is \\"just\\" a financier who funds terrorists. There isn't even a fight with the main henchman! <br /> <br />It's obvious that they've strayed from the formulaic 007, so what do we get instead? <br /> <br />We get an agent who just acquired his 007 status but is still rough around the edges. We see him making questionable decisions and constantly running afoul of M. We see 007 actually losing at cards. The thought that they \\"humanized\\" him, with all the prerequisite foibles, ran through my mind. Further reinforcing that thought were scenes of him recuperating in a wheelchair and falling in love.  <br /> <br />The action is sporadic. The movie opens with a fairly impressive foot chase scene and an airport action sequence soon thereafter. There is a final shootout in a sinking Venitian building but the film does tend to drag in between and does turn into something of a love story. The movie just feels too long and drawn out. The plot is fairly simple in the beginning as they set the stage for the big poker tournament. Again, the bad guy is a financier of terrorists who made some bad investments and needs to earn back his clients money playing poker. Before they kill him. Hardly Auric Goldfinger and the plot feels a bit thin. There are other characters introduced at the end of the movie who seem non sequitur but are perhaps setups for the next installment. <br /> <br />So there it is, a completely different style of James Bond films, but I liked it. <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />

It is a flat out guy movie with brutal close quarter and various sniping action scenes, little importance in the dialogue, and two hot chicks in Rhona Mitra and Kate Mara.

I love every track, but the music enters the awesome category on \\"But Beautiful\\", \\"Save Your Love for Me\\", and \\"All Night Long\\".  \\"Lovetown\\" brings to mind the Crusaders signature song \\"Streetlife\\", and Crawford even throws a few lines from \\"Streetlife\\" at the end.  \\"See Line Woman\\" is a steamy one, and be sure to turn up the volume on \\"Rio De Janiero Blue\\", there's some thumping rhythm on both tracks.

To see Neil Young live in concert has always been a religous experience for me and this recording from Massey Hall really pulls me back into the artists world. The performance and recording are top 5 of anything in my collection. Nothing can be more intimate between artist and listener. The vocals are out front and the guitar work outstanding as usual. This CD is in my stereo testing reference for guitar and vocals. Some of the songs were \\"new\\" and unfinished and would end up on \\"Harvest\\" with added or changed verses. Arguably one of Neil's best works. This recording sounds like David Briggs just let it roll for the night it was recorded. Just as if you were there in Toronto that night listening to Neil explain why or what he was writing about or where he was at the time, unlocking more clues to his creative process and ultimately his genius. I am still amazed by his technique on the acoustic guitar, something that will always set him apart from other claimers. A live performance from Neil. A stool, His Martin D45, and a microphone, the rest is a magic that can't be explained. The '71 Massey Hall recording captures this miracle.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|In reading most of the comments I can see where almost everyone is coming from. However, in listening to the album I can only say that this album is simply sheer enjoyment. I have all of Spock Beard's disks and all four of the newest (post-Beard) CD's of Neal. This one's got everything. It's complexity, heaviness and beauty are in my opinion, in perfect balance. To me Testimony was a perfect 10. However, I felt that \\"One\\" fell short to maybe an 8. Then ? climbed up to a 9. S.S. to me is a 10.5 and still growing (on me).
B000K4WPCC|5.0|[[ASIN:B000K4WPCC The Covenant]] very interesting movie i enjoyed it very much have watched several times
0380018179|5.0|This book is by far the greatest love story of all time.  You cannot help but to fall right into this story!  Wonderful! Wonderful!
1416914285|1.0|I borrowed this book from a friend. I had been hearing about it and wanted to read it to see for myself what the book was or wasn't.    My opinion is that it isn't a very good book from what I've read. I have yet to finish it, but I'm not sure I'll be able to. The characters are cliché and have no depth or development throughout the book. The plot is so see-through that I knew what was coming before I continued on. It could be that the beginning is very rough and it gets better as you go on, but I'm not sure I have the patience to do so. I'm just not finding much enjoyment from reading the book. I admit there are some parts that are clever and funny, but a book need more than just that to carry it.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Peter Sellers plays three different roles in this dark comedy along with a great supporting cast. It is almost zany - mainly because the premise is dated now - but it is still a great movie.
0071373586|5.0|I first read this book back in 1991 when I was taking Advertising in college and it was excellent then.  Now, that I head up AUDIN Web Design, I find it very informative as well as absolutely necessary to keep on my bookshelf. It is interesting to see all the things that they predicted back then come true to today.  I suggest you read all (if not, most) of their books if you are interested in marketing.  If you are in business, especially start-up, then this book is must have. Finally, this book is very informative, because it shows how to focus your business and not fall into pitfalls.
1576462676|3.0|Elizabeth is twenty years old, living in the Victorian ages in England.  Life is a bit tricky for her.  She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia.  They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons.  With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.<br /><br />The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor.  Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged.  When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked.  He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls.  He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social.  After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth.  She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen.  Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling.  What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?<br /><br />I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day.  However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written.  The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery.  I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the lifeof those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine.  The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|2003's Ashes was a pretty good comeback for a band that was once left for dead. Forward to 2007. What does Machine Head do? Instead of jumping on the current metal bandwagon, they decide to write their own musical journey and making today's new breed of bands look weak or generic.  <br /> <br />I really think Phil Demmell saved this band. Ahrue Luster was really terrible in Machine Head. I thought he sounded boring on Hellalive and the stuff he wrote for Supercharger was weak at best either though uc an blame some of it on Robb Flynn.  <br /> <br />You can tell the Rush influence is on this album as opposed to Ashes. Lots of great twists and turns with riffs firing off one by one as well as a great exchange of solos. <br /> <br />Best songs: Track 1, Aesthetics of Hate, Halo, Slanderous. <br /> <br />All the tracks on this album are fantastic.
1582701709|4.0|Many people possess what this book is selling and really don't realize it.  It takes what we know already and pastes it in our face for us to see - really see.  The mind is a terrible thing to waste.  All things that exist, start out as a thought, whether we are spiritual or not.  A very good read.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|the music is amazing. she is growing up and her talent is growing right along with her. each album is a suprise and this one certainly does not let that down.
0060007737|4.0|As the Creative Director for AUDIN Web Design, I found the 11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding (in the back of the book) to be quite invaluable.  That alone was worth the price.  It allowed me to come up with a unique name for my Web Design company.  I chose AUDIN solely on reading this book , Laws of Branding, and it has proven to be a good call because I am so easy to find on the search engines. However, a lot of the regular Branding stuff is a rehash of old books, but the internet stuff is gold, real gold.  It is a quick read and you won't be disappointed (unless if you have read every other book by these authors).  If you are on a tight budget, you might want to combine this book with another to get some savings (no, I don't work for Amazon; I'm just saying..that's all).  I admit I am a bit bias; I just love this stuff--this marketing stuff.  Even if you are not interested in marketing, this a good read for business in general.  You could almost pick stocks based on this info; I did say almost.
B00009P1MP|5.0|This album is totally underrated and to some, forgotten. It is not only a classic for the gifted Don McLean; it is a heartfelt piece of poetry that you will listen to over and over again. I find some nuance, some depth of understanding and musical beauty each time I listen. <br />Songs like EMPTY CHAIRS, VINCENT, and even SISTER FATIMA are poetry set to music, and life experiences that most of us can identify with. <br />BRAVO, DON McLEAN - You still rock after more than 30 years!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie is very inspirational.  Anyone who has a dream and has been doubted by others should watch this movie.  Will Smith and his son Jaden did an outstanding job in this movie.  I have never been thru anything like this, yet I felt like I was there with Chris.  The passion in this movie is real and I recommend this movie to anyone with a passion and a dream.
B000LC3IDI|4.0|This was a very awsome movie. Anyone out there that wants to see a bloody flick but has a good script, saw is your movie....... <br /> <br />p.s. Strong violence and gore, kids under 14 shouldnt see it
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary and then take what action they can to respond to the challenges. The presentation was well laid out and imposible to dispute. Why is our government not leading in the recovery?
B000B2YQX4|5.0|After Exciter came out, I was a bit dissapointed with the new musical approach of Depeche Mode, at that moment I tough Music for the masses was their best album ever and Songs of faith and devotion very very very close, but suddenly appears Playing the angel!!!, I was ready for another slow smoothy album like ultra or exciter, but NO, Here they were standing in front of me with a new energetic sound ready to rock the world. A pain that I'm used to is the best way to start a faboulous album that competes face to face againts the classic DM stuff and inmediately became one of their tops. Touring the angel was simply awesome!!! and unforgettable ride!!!, After 14 years I saw them again!!, My best night ever!!!! ENJOY!!!!!
0321344758|4.0|As the President and Creative Director for AUDIN Web Design [...] I found this book refreshingly informative.  This book provided examples and case studies not found in any other book.  I think this book was written for the client, but every web designer should read this book to get an outsiders (and insiders) view of web design.  Over 95% of web design is wasteful and just awful and this book highlights that fact.  This book is not a How-To book but a What-Not-To-Do which brings home the point even better.  It's also more effective than some website that criticizes other websites, which I will not mention any names here.  Anyway, a great quick read and very informative.  I recommend highly.
B00028U6B8|5.0|People tend to remember this classic as a collection of counterculture, anti-war anthems.  And that's not altogether inaccurate--that description fits \\"We Can Be Together\\" and the title track pretty well.  But some points about this need to be made.  First, if you think this is just a hippie manifesto, you've missed the tongue-in-cheek irony, which is just below the surface in \\"We Can Be Together,\\" and is the whole point of \\"The Farm.\\"  Just one example:  think about the lines \\"We are forces of chaos and anarchy / Everything they say we are, we are / And we are very proud of ourselves.\\"  Doesn't that last line kind of mock the first two?  With that there, can you really take the surface sentiment altogether seriously?  Oh, and listen to how sweetly and off-handedly Grace sings the famous \\"up against the wall, [bleep]\\" line.  You get the feeling that the band simultaneously believed in their causes, and also felt the need to point out the inconsistencies involved.  Saddled-up toads and everything. <br /> <br />So now that the political moment is past, what's the point of listening to a half-ironic commentary on it?  The point is that this was a great band at the height of their musicianship.  Listen to \\"Wooden Ships\\" or, especially, \\"Hey Frederick,\\" and you can't help but be amazed at how jaw-droppingly incredible they sound together.  Jorma Kaukonen, as great as he is, never sounded better than here, and he gels perfectly with Jack Cassady and Paul Kantner.  Spencer Dryden plays just as sharply.  And Grace and Marty sing as amazingly as ever, both separately and together. And you can't underestimate the importance of session pianist Nicky Hopkins. <br /> <br />The first time I heard \\"Hey Frederick,\\" with Grace Slick's magic followed by that long, let-it-never-end jam at the end (of course it's not actually a jam, but is carefully orchestrated), I wanted the second time I heard it to happen right then.  (And so it did.  And so did the third time, for that matter.) And then \\"Wooden Ships\\"--same thing, and it's even better in the context of the album.  \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\"--same thing yet again.  The point is, they sound fantastic, all the time, on all the tracks.  And that--not the content of the lyrics--is why this is a classic.
B000286RKW|5.0|Ever since I seen this movie it was one of my favorites. I got the movie rather quickly and watched it while the cd was still cold from winter travel lol. The movie itself I believe is one of the best. @-disc special edition is waaaay better then just the movie. A must get!
B00000FC5H|5.0|I'm gonna complain a bit here - the live Devotion (off Gratitude, killer studio version made furtherly killer live) and Keep Your Head to the Sky are still missing. Why? Is this one of those stupid cross-label things? Because those are really annoying. And this contains Boogie Wonderland, most likely their worst hit, either that or Let's Groove. Both are disco. Not a coincidence. And they drop All About Love, as well as I'll Write a Song for You. Give me a break! Four of their greatest songs, dropped off a cliff. Splat. Why? Saturday Night's an OK song, but I don't see it as the Best of Earth Wind and Fire. But if you swap those three off, put the four I mentioned on, and keep the rest, you've got the real best of Earth, Wind and Fire. Unlike the 1978 Greatest Hits release, this DOES contain Mighty Mighty, Kalimba Story AND Serpentine Fire, three essentials. Plus it adds After the Love is Gone, a worthy addition to any self-respecting EWF hits collection (or at least any one released after 1978), and their greatest song ever maybe. I'd bet on it. Plus nine of the ten tracks on the '78 release, not coincidentially the nine classics (Got to Get You Into My Life, Fantasy, Can't Hide Love, Getaway, That's the Way of the World, Shining Star, September, Reasons, Sing a Song) - note how they dropped Love Music, which is cool by me because it's just an average song and average songs don't belong on best-ofs, even if they were huge hits (*cough cough Saturday Nite*).<br /><br />Yes, this is a great intro, but don't stop here. Why? All in All, Spirit, Gratitude, That's the Way of the World and Open Our Eyes are all good picks, that's why. But this is the compilation the band deserved.
B0007OY2P8|2.0|As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to \\"period\\" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.
B000M4RG42|4.0|The reality is what I might have suspected, how ever they did what was needed at the time. I'm not sure I needed to know this, how ever I did enjoy the movie.  I'm looking forward to the \\"LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA\\".
B000FTWB7G|5.0|A nice follow up to Fallen - Amy Lee sounds great as always.  The cover of the Lacrymosa from Mozart's requiem is especially poignant.
B000G759LW|5.0|I am a Dance Teacher and she had a song I loved and needed. All the other tracks are Great as well. She is an awesome artist. Love her Voice!!!
B000001GS2|5.0|This is one of my favorites opera recordings, and for me the best Pagliacci recording ever made. Among many virtues, Carlo Bergonzi. I always considered him one of the finest italian tenors, and under Karajan when he unleashes Canio's hurricane the result is chilling. Truly a great Bergonzi for a great Pagliacci.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Of course the plot outline involves two rivalry magicians who compete against each other... but I would say this movie is much more than that.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is simply astonishing us with his direction and especially the screenplay. This movie also has the play with the time element in the screenplay just like his previous movies like [[ASIN:B00000F3CD Following]] and [[ASIN:B0000640SA Memento]], but in a different way (using two diaries!!!).<br /><br />I have watched this movie immediately after watching it for the first time just to catch up with the nuances and subtleties of the characters and screenplay, I was not disappointed. The movie starts with the dialog \\"Are you watching closely?\\" and you should remember this dialog and watch it very closely to get a good grip on the story line.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned my vote goes to Christian Bale for his performance as Alfred Borden. You just won't notice the differences in his acting when he interacts with Sarah (his wife) and Scarlett Johansson (his girlfriend) until and otherwise you see this movie for the second time. For him the acting flows just as natural as blood. Multifaceted acting just like his [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]].<br /><br />Of course another wonderful performances by Michael Caine as Mr. Cutter and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier.<br /><br />Truly a masterpiece. Kudos to Christopher Nolan. Storytelling at its best. Don't even think about missing this movie.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I'm not the biggest fan of electronic music, but this was playing at a party I went to a couple years ago. It's a japanimation movie starring animated caricatures of the band itself and featuring many different styles of their music. If you watch this, or even hear the album, I guarantee the song \\"Harder, better, faster, stronger,\\" will be stuck in your head.
B00000K3D4|5.0|the first time i saw this movie was for art class because of the all the special little characters.  I loved it and wanted to see it again.  i recently purchased this movies for my kids and they to fell in love with it.    <br />all the puppets and the singing and the baby.  Great story line, sarah trying to get her baby brother back before he becomes a goblin himself.  Again great movie.
B0006ZFQNA|5.0|Over the years, this is still my favorite Carmen: great orchestra, great conductor, force and over all elegance... Teresa Berganza is probably my favorite mezzo, and among the best opera singers, and here she probes it. Couple her with Placido Domingo and both spanish artist seems to rescue Carmen back to their native land, no matter how french the opera is.<br /><br />This recording probably will be for ever in my collection, for sure in the first row.
B000MV9026|4.0|\\"Happy Feet,\\" Oscar-winner for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2006, is directed by George Miller, who has helmed \\"Babe: Pig in the City\\" as director. Remember this because despite the cute, cuddly face of a baby penguin you might be looking at in the film's poster or DVD jacket, the film itself looks odd at times, like the adventures of the little pig in the strange town. I'm not saying that \\"Happy Feet\\" (or the sequel of \\"Babe\\") is bad. I'm just saying that you might not find what you think you will find in \\"Happy Feet.\\" <br /> <br />The film starts like a musical parody of \\"March of the Penguin,\\" a recent hit documentary about the life of Emperor Penguins. Lots of penguins are singing, and among them you meet a male penguin `Memphis' (read Elvis) and Norma Jean (read Marilyn). They fell for each other and ... well, you know the rest of the story. Baby boy penguin Mumble is born, who is a terrible singer, but a fantastic dancer with `happy feet.' Ironically his enormous talent is not wanted in the colony he belongs to. <br /> <br />The first part looks like a strange mixture of musical version of nature programs and \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" Ruling elders does not like Mumble and his dancing, which they consider a threat to their colony. His mother is more understanding than his father who looks worried, or worse, embarrassed at his son's behaviors.  <br /> <br />The visuals are always impressive, and the songs are provided liberally (including the cover version of Prince, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, etc) and the chase scenes are thrilling, maybe too thrilling for some kids. <br /> <br />I said you know the rest of the story before. Actually, you don't. Typical story of `finding my own place' with a love interest and comic relief turns into something different in the second half, which is more ambitious than the entire story of \\"Finding Nemo\\" and more serious and even weird than you expect from any animated films produced in Hollywood. All I can say is that itincludes certain messages about the Earth, or in a nutshell, Mumble's \\"Happy Feet\\" saves the world.  <br /> <br />The voice cast is great, including Elijah Wood as Mumble, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Elizabeth Daily, Magda Szubanski, Miriam Margolyes and Robin Williams. It is, however, a bit strange to see and hear a penguin with Elijah Wood's eyes speaking in Elijah Wood's voice. Seeing penguins with voices of Nicole Kidman or Brittany Murphy shaking and wiggling their body is not surely what many of us would expect from the title \\"Happy Feet.\\" It is also reported that Tony winner Savion Glover is hired to shoot the tap dance scenes of the penguin with motion capture device on his body. All you see is, however, animated penguins, of which superhuman dancing ability is, after all, computer graphics, not the real human. <br /> <br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is really a mixed bag. Those who love the comedies of scene stealing (or annoying, if you like) double roles by Robin Williams would find the film's second part very bizarre. Some would find the images of penguins and other creature a bit too realistic, even grotesque. Like he did in the second \\"Babe\\" George Miller finds originality in the places where few other directors would explore, but I am not perfectly certain that disco music/dancing and environmental messages are the right place. \\"Happy Feet\\" is fun, to be sure, but sorry, to me the best animated film on penguins is still \\"Madagascar\\" and its penguin gang.
1582701709|5.0|The book The Secret is like having your own mentor and cheering squad, encouraging you to reach for the stars, and then giving you the tools to show you how to do it. This is a book that everybody should have, to read and go back to it every time you get off track, or start to lose your self confidence. The book takes the ideas of many of previous \\"positive thinkers\\" over the years and makes them relevant in today's culture. Excellent
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is the latest in the \\"Best-Of\\"  For Clapton to unifiy with JJ Cale with Taj Mahal's harmonica, JJ Cale's band, this is sincerely one of the finest sounds I have heard from either of them.  They have picked a few of John's best songs and melded their voices and their guitars.  Clapton wanted to learn Cale's studio techniques and if he didn't he wasn't watching.  This will be one of my favorites for a long time to come and one I will turn other's on to.

B00005JKES|5.0|It would take a real idiot to think that studio people are not excited about this whole mass of people begging to give their money for a new Season1. It is obvious that there is a commercial feast to enjoy for those who own the rights over the DVD distribution of Twin Peaks. Now just be patient. It will come. This is just one of those weird timing that may or may not be the plan of some money-hungry monkeys. By the way, dont be foolish by spending those hundreds of dollars on used sets. Considering the sales that the Season2 is going to produce, one can be sure that within less than 2 years either Season1 is re-released or a special box set with the whole series will be. For those who did buy the first season before, good for you, but be mature quit nagging. This is not highschool playground. Please, all, enjoy life.
0201633612|2.0|This book is overrated, but it does have utility in bringing to your attention design patterns --which should be obvious to any good programmer--such as the Singleton (object only capable of instantiation once).<br /><br />Why do I say obvious?  Because any programmer worth their salt will over time develop their own home-grown library of patterns and exemplars to reuse.  This book merely calls attention to this habit.<br /><br />Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the text is too generic and abstract, unless you're into that.  Donald Knuth anybody?<br /><br />Plus the book is too expensive--if you must, buy it used like I plan to.  That's right, I haven't read it yet.  But I know enough just reading these reviews; sometimes you CAN judge a book by the cover.  I am over the age of 13, yes.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang takes to task the political correctness dominating Japan's culture. Many of its citizens prefer to purge the history books of all mention of the Nanking atrocities. She rightfully contends that no ethnic group has a right to its own politically correct version of history.  The Japanese fascists were racists to the core. They held outsiders in utter contempt. \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" is most certainly not light entertainment.  The organized cruelty of Japan's military was truly horrifying .  One shouldn't even treat mere insects in such a manner.  Researching this era of history is not for the faint of heart.  It may have eventually lead to the author's decision to commit suicide. Nonetheless, you need to read it from beginning to end. Ignorance of history only increases the odds of this sort of evil being repeated in the future. Nobody should probably be able to graduate from college unless they have read this book. Yes, it may be that important.
0345910907|5.0|To research then compose a comprehensive history about any given area, one must pay attention to details details and then more details, this the author has done.   Even thought the book is at least two inches thick it is full of interesting stories of individuals, groups, and geopolitical areas.  Honestly I could not distinguish between the 14th, 15th, thru the 21st centuries.   For every event that was profiled by the author there is an equal event in other centuries that is similar.  Examples,  The Jacquere  fighting for basic rights brought to extermination(The Tasmanians, Darfur), roving militia, terrorizing,killing whole villages( The Klux), stamping people with seals to bring discrimination to them(The Nazis), the black plague taking out whole populated areas(Aids, Ebola) High crimes and Assassinations(Kennedy, Lincoln).  The first estate and sometimes the second estate fleecing the third estate for no other reason than to treat land, people and other assets as some grand chessboard.   The dieification (call chivalry) of warmongering was the foreign policy.  If you have the time, a very good read.  Look for similar great history telling in the works of manchester, zinn, diop, erdoes, jochannon...

B000002UAU|3.0|Although somewhat disappointed that a few of the original songs seem to be recorded differently than on the original album, the clarity of the music and lyrics are as clear and fun as ever.  I keep it in my car permanently and listen to it whenever I need to \\"let loose\\"!
1905236042|5.0|This product is excellent for an experienced Yoga teacher looking for ideas for class or for a parent who is wondering what to do with the kids over spring break!  I highly recommend it!
B0002CHIJW|4.0|I bought this movie because I was intrigued by it.  The cinematography is incredible.  Visually, it is stunning.  The rape scenes ARE savage, but  I was touched by the emotional devastation the actress was able to convey.  As a woman I was rooting for the heroine and I must admit I was a little disappointed in the ease with which she dispatched three of her assailants.  Her revenge on Matthew was \\"OK\\" but I would have liked to have seen a little blood and gore.  When I first saw the bathtub scene between the heroine and Johnny I was a little nauseated by all the blood but I couldn't help but laugh at the way she dispatched him.  The heroine's numb composure throughout the revenge sequences is  fully understandable (that is, if you're a woman).  Kudos to Ms. Keaton for a very persuasive acting job.
B00000JG41|5.0|I love everything Mike Patton has done. Mr. Bungle is my favorite of all of his projects. When California came out I was completly blown away. They yet again had turned in a new direction and even though it is more along the lines of \\"Music\\" compared to the other albums California is a masterpiece of modern music. <br />The songs are all very easy to listen to but if you pay close attention you will notice that there is a huge amount of instrumentation and vocalism going on. <br />This is by fary my favorite Bungle album, even more than the self titled Debut. I just bought this for the third time (stolen twice now) and I am so happy to have it back in my collection. If you like Patton at all and have not heard California, get it. <br /> <br /> <br />Goodbye Sober Day

B00004S6GL|5.0|Steven Paul Smith was born on August 6, 1969 in Omaha. He later changed the name Steven to Elliott. He felt it sounded less \\"jock-like.\\"<br /><br />I do believe Elliott Smith had a really amazing if not sad and lonely kind of voice. I can feel a bit more uplifting type of mood coming from Elliott Smith's Figure 8, his best and last studio record before he died. Ever since the end of his band Heatmiser, his solo work became more personal and less abrasive. It's hard to imagine at one point he was part of just another small punk/grunge band, who not many have heard of.<br /><br />Many would prefer \\"Either/Or.\\" Which seems optimistic at times, but kind of sad to me. At this time few singer/songwriters could match Elliott's level of intensity through lo-fi \\"folk-punk\\" intimacy. That release sparked interest in the director of Good Will Hunting, Gus Van Sant- who used some of Elliott's songs for his picture. They met while Elliott lived in Portland. Also this exposure proppelled Elliott Smith to major-label status from Kill Rock Stars to Dreamworks. And then came XO in 1998. And Figure 8 in 2000. In my opinion this is his best. It flourishes with rich, multi-layered and more lush tracks. Not as intimate as his earlier solo works w/ the exception of \\"Everything Means Nothing to Me.\\" This does seem happier though, at least compared to his other works. Definately one of the best solo albums and one of my favorites of this millenium. A wonderful timeless album from one of the better singer/songwriters after those \\"grunge era\\" days. My favorites here include: \\"Son of Sam\\"- \\"Junkbond Trader\\" -\\"Stupidity Tries\\" - \\"Easy Way Out\\" - \\"In the Lost & Found\\" -(for this song Elliott uses the same Abbey Road piano Paul McCartney played on \\"Penny Lane\\")<br /><br />Elliott Smith has always been a long time Beatles fan. Even covered their song \\"Because\\"- which is on a import of Figure 8. I really do feel he approaches a kind of greatness w/ this almost perfect solo work. I just wish he was still alive creating more.<br /><br /> It's just really sad the way Elliott Smith died. Two stab wounds in his chest from a kitchen knife. And I believe the coroner at the time never came to a conclusion whether it was a homicide or a suicide. His death was on October 21 2003.<br /><br />I give Figure 8- 5 stars. It is my favorite Elliott Smith album, if you haven't heard Elliott Smith before you really should give this a listen. Or pick up \\"Either/Or\\" if you like a softer sound, but both are essential from him.creating more. <br /> It's just really sad the way Elliott Smith died.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is a first class production by outstanding vocalists and musicians in an authentic setting commensurate with the compositions being presented. I first saw it as a PBS broadcast and before the day was out, had ordered my copy.
B00004TH6O|4.0|As I fell in love with \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" and \\"Lullabies To Paralyze\\", I continued the trend and bought \\"Rated R\\". At first I was a little suspicious as to the quality of the cd from previous reviews but I bought it anyways. Fortunatly, I fell in love wiht this cd as well. Although not my favorite QOTSA cd, it still is essential to your collection. Joshua's guitar playing skills alone are enough for you to buy the album. I seriously suggest this cd if you consider yourself a big QOTSA fan, but if this is the first album that you are buying from them, I would buy the later two albums first.

B000IU3XTM|4.0|I stumbled upon Damien Rice's debut \\"O\\" after hearing the completely in your face \\"The Blower's Daughter,\\" which was very effectively used in the Mike Nichols movie \\"Closer.\\" It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head. \\"O\\" also included the catchy \\"Volcano\\" but what made it earn 5 stars for me was the complete confidence in which Rice just lets his musings come out. None of the other songs were as catchy, but no less enjoyable as he commanded attention even when he was almost silent.<br /><br />\\"9\\" starts off with the gorgeous \\"9 Crimes,\\" which even more than \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" had the fortune of getting some serious airtime as it was prominently used in a November sweeps episode of \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" That song has an otherwordly feel that I don't remember feeling since hearing Kate Bush's \\"Running Up That Hill\\" in the mid 1980's.<br /><br />The rest of the release is by no means disappointing, but there has been such an influx of singer/songwriters in the past few years that it is difficult to stand out. Here Rice seems less concerned about letting you in on his thoughts as he did in \\"0\\", than in telling his tale and giving you the option of listening in if you want to. He does not project with the same force and it makes for a less showy record. To me that is not a bad thing as he could have easily made a sequel to \\"0\\", but here the stories are more dense, confusing, but ultimately quite universal.<br /><br />If you liked \\"0\\" as a whole and not just the better know songs, it's a safe bet that you'll like \\"9.\\" On the other hand if you don't like this type of confessional music, nothing here will change your mind about this artist.<br /><br />No sophomore slump for Rice and here is to many more releases of this caliber. They can't all earn 5 stars, but there is a significant number of singer-songwriters who are proving that they too can hold their own in world where pre-packaged and overly produced releases seemed to be the only options in the horizon.s in the horizon.
B000003TB6|5.0|I love this group.  I love the jazz infused hip hop verses.  If you're looking for something mellow with a little edge, then this is the CD for you.
B00003CXBK|3.0|I am an avid fan of Miyazaki.  As a family we've watched Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Valley of the Wind, Totoro, Kiki's delivery service, etc.  Wonderful movies that our whole family has enjoyed.  I picked this one up in a store under \\"family movies\\".  The movie was much too violent and graphic for our elementary aged kids.  Wish there had been a warning of some type and that this had been in a teen or adult section.  Had we known we would have watched it after they went to bed and probably enjoyed it.
B000M06K5C|5.0|This is not \\"Silent Alarm II\\". Bloc Party (wisely, in my opinion) decided to step in a new direction. Gone are the guitar riffs of \\"Helicopter\\" and Matt Tong tones back his trademark stacatto drumming slightly (but still manages to be a complete beast). In are more meaningful lyrics, a deeper, richer and fuller sound, and, above all, a more mature sound. This is definitely a band that is maturing and discovering what it wants to be and sound like, hence the huge differences between the sounds of \\"Silent Alarm\\" and \\"A Weekend in the City\\". However, do not mistake this difference for weakness. \\"Weekend\\" is a strong album and a great album, and hopefully a barometer of what Bloc Party will be doing in the future.

Thank you Amazon!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|VERY good movie - the best Ive seen in quite awhile - light hearted and funny.
1594200823|4.0|I was first blown away by the writing of Michael Pollan in \\"Second Nature\\" when he analyzed all the hypocrisies and realities of balancing man and nature from the perspective of his own mundane garden.  Now, turning to something equally as mundane as his dinner plate, he continues to amaze.     This book is certainly incredible and insightful.  The industrial agriculture section takes a topic many others have covered and looking at it from a slightly different perspective - corn. The skeptical take on industrial organic is one I have not previously seen.  Hopefully it will help push organic to the next step.  The local organic farming section gave me an extraordinary appreciation for the notion that these seemingly simpleton \\"hippie farmers\\", as they were once known, may possess a far more sophisticated understanding of the world and true intelligence than any their big city or big industry detractors who pride themselves on what is in reality a shallow facade of sophistication.  Hopefully, too, some of these more radical sects will have a new apprecation for hunting having read it from the perspective of one they are more apt to respect.    It's also an amazing book in that once in the second half I would put the book down with hundreds of pages to go and wonder what else in the world this guy could say about food.  But, right to the end, he keeps coming up with new and important topics that unearth another piece of the omnivore's dilemma.    My only gripe with the book is that, based on his other do-it-yourself books (from gardening to building) he seems to be driving from the get go to his ideal and dismissing the others along the way.      A nice companion piece to this book, therefore, is an open letter on Whole Foods' website from its CEO to Mr. Pollan.  There is an almost insurmountable hypocrisy to anybody who writes a book lambasting capitalist industrialization of one kind (food) while using another form of it to sell a book globally.  What products are deemed worthy enough of the massive amount of fossil fuels that are such a key part of his argument?  Pollan argues adamently for raising the priority of food in our lives as consumers, yet this is one issue left unaddressed.    I think Whole Foods embodies an understanding that organic and sustainability is a very new, evolving process, not at an ideal place to which we can all just leap.  Someday I am sure, should we survive ourselves, we will all choose to have people like Joel Salatin (the local organic farmer) feed us.  In the meantime, industrial organic agriculture and the supermarkets that sell it play an important role in turning many thousands of acres and people away from toxic pesticides.

078401213X|4.0|First time I seen this movie, it was for me really interesting. I am keen on statistic/analyze/data mining, so it takes my attention really fast. There are small and wonderfull crosspoints and relations between the dialogues. Two or more meanings for \\"questions\\" and \\"answers\\". It force you to think and think and think.<br /><br />I don't mind that this is Black/White movie, I love it even more. Sondtrack totally fit to scenes. Data images during credits are really interestings, stay and watch them, try to \\"pause\\" and you will be suprised, there are a lot of related pictures to the whole movie.<br /><br />Final picture of GO board is totally AMAZING, I play go as amateur and this ending gameboard structure is selfexplanatory. GO's players will understand.<br /><br />Finally i think this movie is not \\"family\\" or movie for relax time. IMHO this stuff needs your fully attention during wathing.<br /><br />I seen this movie for let's say 4 times ? Every time I get something new from the movie and this is, what I like about this movie. It is not boring after several reviews.<br /><br />-keep'watchin'-
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|The sound trak on this movie is trouble. You can't hear the actor and actress when they are talking. I love the A&E movie much better. I put a link to the better one.[[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]]
B000MNP2KI|5.0|If there were ever any doubts as to the suitability of the selection of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond then those doubts should vanish instantly after seeing Casino Royale. I like Craig. He LOOKS like a professional assassin and plays the part to the hilt. I think that he is the best Bond since Sean Connery. <br />I won't rehash the entire plot of the movie, it has a pretty standard theme. That is: On behalf of Her Majesty's Government, James Bond fights a shadowy organization headed by an elusive, ruthless, sinister, and enigmatic boss out to control the world. <br />You will find Casino Royale to be action-packed and immensely satisfying. Many of the stunts are breath-taking and often performed by the actors themselves. And though the story is 50 years old, the technology is modern. No need for the futuristic gadgets of the Connery years. The future is now! And the villains are no longer the Soviets and their lackeys, but instead are international terrorists and those who bankroll them. Of course, action takes place in many exotic locales, the most picturesque of which is Montenegro. Then there are the Bond women, beautiful and sultry as ever. <br />In addition to Craig, I also enjoyed other the other main characters especially the mysterious Solange played by Italian actress Caterina Murino. The only question I had at the end was who Mr White was and where he fit in after Le Chiffre was eliminated. That is, besides the obvious fact that he was the one who ended up with the briefcase containing Her Majesty's Government's money. <br />The action, the quality of the filming, the stunts, and the acting itself all combine to make Casino Royale a movie I'll watch many times. The only aspect of the package that annoys me is having to skip though the previews of other movies that precede the film. That annoyance is more than mitigated, though, by the bonus disc. The stories on how the new James Bond was chosen, the stunts and how they were done, and especially the piece on Bond Girls through the years add much value and make this special-edition package a real bargain. <br />If you are a Bond fan and haven't seen this yet, get it. Its one of the best.
B000NA28I4|2.0|You probably already know that Eragon was a book before it was a movie, and it would be a waste of my time and yours to compare and contrast the two.  A movie will not be a pop-up version of a novel.  It is best, then, to evaluate the merits of the medium on its own.  And, unfortunately, the movie doesn't stand on its own very well.<br /><br />Enter Eragon, a young farm-boy with a grand destiny after he finds a beautiful stone in the forest that turns out to be a dragon egg.  Said egg hatches, and adventure ensues.  Well... sort of.  The main thing that this movie lacks is a sense of suspense and a meaningful second act.  In fact, the movie felt like it was just one very long first act.  (This is, in fact, likely as the book was meant to be the first part in a trilogy.)<br /><br />The movie leads us to an almost suspenseful climax as Eragon battles one of a mere henchmen of the realm's evil king.  No true confrontation with destiny, very little meaningful character progression, and mediocre performances (with the exception of Jeremy Irons).  The casting and costume/prop design leave much to be desired, and never give the rugged fantasy feel that the movie calls for.<br /><br />Pass on this one folks.  If you need a cheap fantasy fix, rent something like Dungeons and Dragons, which doesn't have any pretensions of being packaged as good movie.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Paris, Texas is a real place. Supposedly, the main character, Travis, claims his old father once said he was conceived in Paris, Texas, some tiny dusty ghost of a town blistering in the dry heat of the Mojave somewhere in the center of Texas. Hardly the Paris we'd all first assume.<br /><br />We find Travis lost, depressed, mute and alone in the center of the hot summer Texan drylands.<br /><br />Like an egg cooking, we are slowly introduced into this shy and sad character's life. A doctor finds him with only a single clue, a business card in his pocket.  The name of the person on the card happens to be his brother (Dean Stanton) in Los Angeles.<br /><br />From here, the story develops when Travis'es brother's character is developed.  We see how his brother took care of his son and then we are introduced into his brother's household where we meet his son Hunter who vaguely remembers his biological father, Travis and refers to his uncle and aunt as \\"mom and dad.\\"<br /><br />The movie slowly unpeels Travis'es life like a gentle emotional nostalgic striptease, until nearly 1 hour and 50 minutes into the film, we finally discover who Travis's lover and who Hunter's true biological mother is.<br /><br />It's a slowly developing movie that is patient and true to the nature of our protaganist who has gone 4 years without talking and who has changed as a result of the path in life he's taken.<br /><br />Wim Wenders, director of \\"Wings of Desire\\" has his signature cinematographic touches and as always, patiently introduces us to new characters in an intriguing manner.<br /><br />The late introduction of Natasha Kinski's character was beautifully done as we develop a picture of her and finally are introduced to her mystically in a red car riding through through tributary freeways of Houston, Texas.  So much development is made of her character, that, when we are finally introduced to her, in a seedy joint with \\"pay to talk to chicks booths\\", she portrays the very goddess like appeal and attraction that Travis'es character has for her.  The sordid location served little significance.<br /><br />Her acting is convincing and angelically portrayed, and beautifully written.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is ethereal.  The night colors of Los Angeles are remarkable. The landscapes invinceable. There is also an intriguing interpretation of America from a German Director. Sometimes the character mannerisms, behaviors and dialogues are too European and unAmericanly directed. But all and all, I love this movie as I appreciate most Wim Wenders movies.<br /><br />My favorite scene was easily the scene with Sullivan and Travis chasing mom on the freeways of Houston.

In the meantime, this book is great to carry around or to have on your nightstand to revisit The Secret frequently.  The book is also very attractive and it's a great, portable size.
B0000070QS|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I was TERRIFIED when I listened to the first track on Wild Seed - 'A Kind of Christmas Card'. I wasn't sure what to expect from Morten. Although 'A Kind of Christmas Card' is a very enjoyable song, the vocals are something I didn't expect... there is something charmingly imperfect about them, and I really like that. I really do. I almost didn't recognize his voice. <br />The rest of the songs are even better, ranging from little ballads to soft rock beats, and although I haven't had time to get through all of them, they are more into the soul and life of the music and the meaning of the lyrics behind the song, than the perfection of the vocals of the song itself, because he wrote them... if that makes sense?  <br />I guess what I'm trying to say is, this has 50 high-star ratings and reviews for a reason: it is different, and a fantastic solo album. Morten is a singer and an artist is free to do whatever he wants and it shows. I guess my favorite as of right now would have to be 'Brodsky Tune' which has a really fun, almost Spanish-sounding beat!  <br /> <br />You will not be wasting your money buying this, it is something everyone needs to own!
0142001104|3.0|I found the stories to reinforce the concepts very helpful in remembering the rules and they were thought provoking in good ways.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Of all of Jane Austen's adaptations, Persuasion seems to me to be the best. The story of a long-simmering love that was lost and ultimately found again is told in such a subtle manner as to tug at one's heartstrings, and draw us into the enduring love story between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The two leads are impeccable in their performances...Amanda Root plays a lovelorn Anne who tries to 'speak' her true feelings in gestures rather than words, and Ciaran Hinds makes a dashing Captain Wentworth, who still smarting from Anne's rejection of his proposal years ago, nevertheless still loves her. The rest of the cast do an equally amazing job of playing out their respective parts, and the scenes of the English countryside, and the coastal city of Bath are purely enchanting. A poignant, and well-told love story that will endure through time, and definitely worth multiple viewings!
B00011F5DK|5.0|We got into this game from other family members while visiting.  This game is great for all ages of the family.  I would say probably 7 and up depending on the maturity and level of thinking your child can do.  But, its a great family fun.  Even for the teenager that thinks they are too good for family games. <br /> <br />
B000MV9026|1.0|Happy Feet was one of the worst  movies I ever viewed. Was there really a story? The song lyrics were inappropriate for young children. Many scenes were full of sexual inuendoes. The animation was great, the scenery was beautiful. We suffered through it up to track 19 before calling it quits. <br />How it won any awards is beyond me.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This is a beautiful recording. She is  a great singer and my son attended the University of North Texas with her and he said she is a great lady!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|All those people who say that this movie is boring is probably part of the MTV generation with short attention spans. Most negative reviewers seem to have it in for Keanu Reeves and they don't even list any specific points as to why they didn't like the movie.(One reviewer said that he didn't like the husky voice of female lead character, Rachael Weisz. Come on!) <br /> <br />Personally, I liked the surreal feel of the movie. The cinematography was excellent and cast of characters, Gabriel, Papa Midnight, etc. made it interesting.  <br /> <br />It was also thought provoking. For example Constantine tried to commit suicide as a teenager and was clinically dead for two minutes. In \\"real life\\" would it really count as suicide since he was revived? <br /> <br />All in all this movie had great special effects, great scenery (Constantine's apartment was awesome!)and a fascinating subject matter. Watch the movie and come to your own conclusion!
B00005JPCF|3.0|Awhile ago, I watched the Polar Express, the all-CG Christmas film by Robert Zemeckis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump fame. It was a stunning film to look at (except those doll eyes) but the story basically trodded along and I called the film \\"bi-polar\\" since it did as much things wrong as it did right. Happy Feet is the exact same way. The animation is consistently stunning but then it's got other elements that prevents it from being a good animation film. It has its fans but some people, like me, won't know what they just saw. <br /> <br />In the land of Antarctica, penguins find their mates through \\"heartsongs\\" where penguins sing and should someone connect with it, then they become mates. Due to an accident, young Mumble can't sing to save his life but he can tap dance like no one's business. But in penguin land, tap dancing is just not cool and he desperatedly tries to win the affections of penguin Gloria while also solving the problem of the shortage of fish with the help of a young spanish-accented posse. <br /> <br />How to describe Happy Feet...it's hard. For one third, it's basically Moulin Rouge! with penguins. It's unbelievably strange to hear penguins sing \\"Somebody to Love\\" by Queen but like in Moulin Rouge!, it at least fit the tone and feel. Then it becomes essentially like Dreamworks' films with a bunch of pop-culture references and lowbrow humor, courtesy of Robin Williams heading the spanish posse. Then we get an environmental message and the weirdest last act I've ever seen in an animated movie. How this won over Cars and Monster House is completely beyond me. Cars is considered Pixar's weakest output while Monster House was a bit more intense for the younger viewers so Happy Feet probably got a default win. <br /> <br />However, I can't fault the film on the animation. In the special features of Finding Nemo, they asked the animators to get realistic with the water to the point where it looked indisguishable from reality so they had to dial it back and made it more animation friendly. Happy Feet though didn't listen and some shots, such as vista scenes and landscapes look straight out of documentaries; they're just that sharp. Then we have the oh-so-adorable penguin babies and a couple great action scenes with the highlight being Mumble outrunning a sea lion. And I don't want to spoil one other use of filmmaking they used at the end but it's definately a \\"what the?\\" moment. <br /> <br />Some people are developing a DVD sixth sense: anticipating a double-dip. The extras here are unbelievably light to the point where you just know looking at the back that there's a future 2-disc on its way. Of course the kiddies won't mind but for others who like to get some insight into the film, this is quite disappointing; especially when it's been over a month since the film won the Oscar.  <br /> <br />The film's got stellar animation but a very schizophrenic story and there's a couple of moments that made me laugh unintentionally (basically the last 10-15 minutes or so) so kids will probably like it while others feel disappointed. That's where I am.
B000GB775E|3.0|Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) stars as a yuppie who takes life (and her luck) for granted. After meeting loveable loser Jake (Chris Pine), he siphons away her luck with a kiss turning her luck sour. Can Ashley restore her luck to its former greatness or is she destined to be a loser?<br /><br />This was an enjoyable lightweight comedy with unchallenging dialog, pretty people and a few really funny scenes. I enjoyed it, but I got a bit bored during the part where Ashley's luck runs bad. I don't really like watching someone constantly humiliated and embarrassed, even fictionally, and I'm not a huge fan of slapstick so the scenes with the washer and dryer and the blow dryer were 'meh' moments for me. Overall, it was a cute film but nothing ground breaking. 3 stars.
B00004U28G|4.0|I have never understood the critical dogging of this film.  What were people expecting to see?  It's a low-budget, screwball comedy that is just fun to watch.  You could tell that the actors were just having a good time and it helps to make the film that fun to watch.  As such, the performances aren't that bad.  For example, try to watch Jack Elam in this and picture him in all of those serious, nasty villian roles he had in westerns.  Sammy Davis and Dean Martin working together is almost worth the price alone.  Their great chemistry is apparent.  Frank Sinatra wanted to be in the sequel after seeing them in this.  Roger Moore may have only been doing a parody of himself, but I have always wanted to see him do more comedy.  He was known for helping to maintain a light-hearted atmosphere during the long filming of the Bond pictures.  Also, this is the only one of Jackie Chan's (who actually does race cars) early Hollywood films that shows his talent for mixing martial arts and comedy.  Who cares if he doesn't look japanese (which his character is supposed to be).  Hollywood wouldn't realize what they had been missing until the success of Rush Hour.  Hal Needam (Smokey and the Bandit) was just making a film to entertain, not educate or win oscars.  And, it worked.  Fast cars, laughs and great looking ladies (Adrienne Barbeau, yow!).  I have grown tired of critics reviewing all films under the same guidelines instead of for what they are.  I would have given it five stars but it was not quite as laugh-a-minute as some of the works of Blake Edwards, Billy Wilder and Buster Keaton and I would have liked to seen more car stunts.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Two rival magicians (Jackman and Bales) in the late 1800's.  Each trying to sabotage each other, outdo each other, and decode the secrets of each others tricks.  The twists and turns in this movie never seem to end.  The story even brings in Houdini's water closet escape trick as well as the great scientist Tesla.  The story does exaggerate a lot about Tesla but it seems to work in this film. <br /> <br />The acting is first class and Michael Caine puts in another great supporting spot.  Scarlett Johannsan is not quite as good as Jessica Beals was in The Illusionist but she is acceptable a the magician's assistant and lover. <br /> <br />I would have given the film 5 stars but I was a little disappointed with the ending which seemed too implausible. <br /> <br />
B000002L68|5.0|What a great soundtrack...brings me back to the age of 14, but who cares!  The songs that were not overplayed on the radio are even better than the ones that were, but \\"When Doves Cry\\" will always be a fave no matter what - add it to your collection!
B000J10EQU|2.0|For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to \\"believe\\". <br />The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. <br />Why the story is so weak? <br />First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). <br />Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. <br />And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. <br />Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? <br />Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. <br />More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite. <br /> <br />Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. <br />I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00097DXZS|1.0|It appears that Carlos Santana's latest outing  was created to appeal to the widest audience possible. <br /> <br />But now that Santana is an established household name, perhaps he can consider returning to the kind of music that made him so critically acclaimed and accepted. <br /> <br />To my mind, Santana's greatest moments were during the Caravanserai-Welcome-Borboletta chapter. It was, indeed, a ground-breaking period in his career. A time when, musically,  enlightenment and understatement meant something.  <br /> <br />Carlos Santana is best when he is experimenting.  And he has created a temple of followers that have hung with him over the years.  But, with All That I Am, I am lost.   And, as a fan, I am truly far from home. <br />
0312263120|1.0|This is a book that gives you two choices: reading it very quickly trying to find some gem in the mud or thowing it away after the first 20 pages. <br />It is a strange mix of wrong computational concepts and idiotic mathematics, which will only buy a 10 year old kid. <br />Anyone with the lightest knowledge will get angry reading the concepts Dan Brown tries to push on the reader... even more considering the introduction that tries to tell us that he did some research. I think that his research material consisted of a bunch of D-rating sci-fi of the 80's and Roadrunner cartoons. <br />So, the only thing left is the thriller story: and old mix of kills, sex, car pursues in an European country (very fashion)... just clichès, clichès and more clichés... boring, boreng, boring. <br />Let me give you a piece of advice: don't waste yout time with this book, buy an other one, spend quality time with your family... whatever you like. <br />
B000N3ST8O|5.0|First,love Stevie.She is one of my all-time faves.Bought her first collection back then.Probably would have bought the new cd,but not right away. With the DVD,it made me buy it right away.Being she made the coolest vids.The newer versions of \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Rock n Roll\\" were awesome!!!! The combo is highly recommended.Look forward to a new cd of originals.<br /><br />Love you Stevie.
B0000844M8|5.0|This movie is an excellent movie for children.  I recommend it highly.  It can be used as a basis for discussion of several topics, especially the need to preserve wildlife in the wild, the role of zoos, etc.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Who would have guessed Neil Young could get any better?  This is a classic Neil Young sound.  Incredible.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This is the best Emma - every bit as good as the book. I saw another production, with Kate Beckinsale. It didn't have the joie de vivre this production has. The costumes, settings and cinematography are rich and wonderful. I fell in love with Knightley myself. Don't forget to read the book too, if you haven't.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon really stand out in this smart, action packed suspenseful thriller. I really loved this movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|You can't beat it. The settings, the cast, bring this favorite Jane Austen to life so perfectly! Even my Mom is in love with Colin Firth! And Jennifer Ehle is so expressive and likeable! You really can't beat this production.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|The actors and the story, of course, are so engaging. It's an uplifting story for anyone with a romantic soul. Another winning UK production!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Love the movie, satisfied with Amazon.  As always fast shipping and no problems!
B00007LTIA|5.0|The most important thing about this release is the sound quality. Even George Marino's WEA remaster release of this album is nothing when compared with Rhino's release. It's something like a sonic 3-D construction, because you can hear guitar, drums, bass, keyboards and vocals as separated parts, clear as crystal, if crystals could be heard. There's a missing intro for \\"Revealing\\" that I never heard in 30 years that gives a new perspective for this song. The best one for me still is \\"Ritual\\", one of Yes best songs ever. Long live to Tales, long live to Yes. Nous Somme Du Soleil. They always will be an eternal light in Rock History.

B00005JPMC|4.0|\\"Shooter\\" is one of those action films with such an improbable plot that it begs you to find it ridiculous and laugh at it. It is a ridiculous film, but a strangely engaging one.<br /><br />I have mentioned in the past that I am a fan of adrenaline filled action films, the type that made producer Joel Silver richer than God, and eagerly go to each, awaiting the next great \\"Lethal Weapon\\" or \\"Die Hard\\". Well, \\"Shooter\\" is neither of these, but it is an acceptable stepping stone as we wait for that next great action extravaganza.<br /><br />Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, a subtle name for his character I might add), is a sharpshooter in the military, one of five or six men in the world that can make a shot from over a mile away. Apparently, women don't factor into the equation. He and his partner, the spotter, are on a covert mission in Ethiopia when everything goes wrong. A number of years later, Swagger is living as much off the grid as possible in a small cabin out in the woods, with his faithful dog, Sam. One day, Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) and his two assistants, arrive to enlist Swagger's help. They have learned there will be an attempt on the life of the President of the United States. Their intelligence reports indicate the shooter will pick one of three of the President's upcoming public speaking engagements. They want Swagger to help them identify where and how the assassin will strike. Swagger says `No'; he isn't happy with his treatment after the Ethiopian incident or the government in particular. But he realizes he may be able to help and scouts the locations on his own before he realizes Philadelphia is the place. Johnson asks him to be present, to help identify the shooter's location, and he agrees. But Swagger is framed for the assassination attempt and goes on the run. A rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, \\"Crash\\") gets involved and realizes there may be a conspiracy. Swagger runs and runs and finally arrives at the home of his ex-partner's fianc&eacute;e, Sarah (Kate Mara). Will Swagger be able to uncover the truth as he runs for his life?<br /><br />Directed by Antoine Fuqua (\\"Training Day\\"), \\"Shooter\\" is a film that goes to great lengths to make the story believable, but it is so filled with conspiracy and double crossing, that it just isn't representative of how our government is run, so we ultimately can't believe it. Must.... Stop... Typing these... Lies. Okay, I'm back. So, we all know the government is involved in some secret stuff that we probably don't want to know about, any government, led by Democrats or Republicans, and \\"Shooter\\" does a good job of portraying this. But Swagger is akin to Superman, he eludes multiple government agencies, police forces, secret agencies, bullets seem to bounce off of him, and more. And this stretches the credibility of the story thin, so thin you can read a newspaper through it.<br /><br />And the one thing that helps to ground the film and us, to keep us running from the theater laughing our heads off? Mark Wahlberg. The film sets up his skill level; we watch during his mission in Ethiopia, and many people testify to his great ability, so that is something we more or less accept as a given. He is, after all, one of only five or six men in the world who can make the shot. Apparently, women don't have the trigger finger skills. At one point, he comments the government spent a lot of money training him how to stay alive. This is a throwaway moment, but it helps to partially explain how he is able to elude all of these people and stay alive. Again, this wouldn't work so well without Wahlberg's personality filling the role.<br /><br />Wahlberg is not a great actor, but he has a winning personality and has the requisite charisma to hold our attention while he is on screen. As Swagger, he doesn't have to emote a lot, but we feel his pain and frustration as he works his way through the situation. Throughout the years, there have been a number of actors who have gained a reputation as simply being themselves onscreen, earning a lot of money, as this given persona in the process. John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood and others all more or less appear on screen as themselves, or at least the persona they create for the public. Occasionally, they are able to reach further inside themselves and create a unique, unusual, more interesting character, something a little different. Clint Eastwood has been more successful in this regard, but his characters are always variations on a theme. I am not saying Wahlberg has achieved the same status as these icons of American cinema, but he is certainly on the path. He is, more or less, the same character in each of his films; the working class guy, soft spoken, who triumphs over adversity. The recent exception would be his work in Martin Scorcese's \\"The Departed\\", an award worthy performance. But I suspect Wahlberg will have a long and fruitful career appearing in a number of films such as \\"Shooter\\". His mere presence, the soft spoken every man, helps to make Swagger seem real and allow us to have more sympathy for him.<br /><br />Danny Glover is pretty good as the strange Colonel Johnson, who has a hand in many nefarious activities around the world. Glover wears a dental prosthetic throughout the film, it is clearly visible a few times, and causes him to slur and lisp quite a bit. It is quite strange to listen to Glover, playing this menacing \\"Colonel\\", using this very strange method of speaking. Ultimately, this undermines the seriousness, the scariness of his character.<br /><br />Michael Pena is also good as rookie FBI agent Nick Memphis. He shows his embarrassment at being overtaken by Swagger, his face plastered on the news. Then, when he realizes something is going on, his instincts kick in and he tries to solve the mystery. He continues to investigate, despite interference from the department and all of the obstacles placed in his way. Throughout the film, he shows the common sense we might all hope to have in the situations he faces, making his actions more believable.<br /><br />Kate Mara adds less significance. She doesn't even know Swagger when he shows up at her door and soon is involved in his plot to uncover the truth. She seems to be around to add a female presence, no matter how slight.<br /><br />Ned Beatty makes an appearance as a very Dick Cheney-like Senator from Montana. He is good, but the performance is one note, which it should be. He is supposed to be crooked, evil and he is.<br /><br />Director Fuqua has a good knack for action and handles most of the action scenes well. He presents the complicated stunts and maneuvers in an easy to follow way, keeping us on the edge of our seats for most of the film. But, as is the case with most of these extravaganzas, he has to keep ramping up the action. Once Swagger has taken out one guy, he then has to face three guys. Once he has faced three guys, he has to face a small squad of men with semi-automatics. Then, a whole helicopter battalion complete with missiles. And so on. If he only had to fight one guy after another, we would get bored. But on the other hand, because everything is required to escalate so quickly, Swagger also starts to appear infallible, further propagating the need for more and more elaborate and dangerous looking action sequences. After a while, it gets silly, and we become numb. Will he ever not be successful in a confrontation? When he walks through a wall of exploding bombs, we realize nothing will ever cause Swagger harm. This, of course, robs the film of suspense in the last, crucial act of the story.<br /><br />\\"Shooter\\" is a fun action film, engaging because of Mark Wahlberg's personality, and certainly worth the price of a bargain matinee.have gained a reputation as simply being themselves onscreen, earning a lot of money, as this given persona in the process.

B000002JSN|5.0|Already had first cd pressing. Sounded like you know what. Picked this because of the remastering. Definitely worth it. <br />                                                    J.Guida
B00003652Q|4.0|Script is a very good debut album which contains really great songs as \\"Forgotten Sons\\", \\"Chelsea Monday\\" and of course, the title track. <br />\\"Garden Party\\" has its moment, it is an entertaining song. <br />As far as I can remember, I never liked \\"He knows you know\\". <br />\\"The Web\\" is a good one but is a bit less interesting musically, the quality of musical transitions is questionnable. <br />The remaster is better than the original recording, but as another reviewer said, the sound is a bit dated, some older albums sounds better but you must remember that it is a debut album, so money is probably the reason for the lower quality production. In my opinion, the drum player is good but not great.  The band make a good move when they included Ian Mosley in the band for the following album.  The guitar has too much \\"reverb\\" in my opinion. Overall, a very good debut. <br /> <br />The bonus cd include another version of \\"Grendel\\"  As you might know, Fish doesn't like this one and I agree with him.  The ending section is cleary a pale copy of the ending section of \\"Supper's Ready\\" (Genesis) <br />The voice of Fish is not very good in the last part of Grendel. <br />You'll find some good tracks on the bonus cd like \\"Market Square heroes\\" and \\"Charting the single\\"  the rest is for die hard fans I would say.
B000000IVI|5.0|Simply outsanding. The Mobile Fidelity GOLD CD augments this. <br />                                           J.Guida
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I'm a huge Beatle fan. I \\"grew up\\" with them. And I never really cared for \\"Let it Be.\\" \\"...Naked\\" isn't much of an improvement. Technically it actually sounds worse, although de-Spectoring was a good idea. The original plan was to have a rough, live feel to the album, but the group was spintering and Phil Spector came along with his big production ideas. You can now purchase \\"Get Back\\" (the advanced LP pressing of \\"Let it Be\\" sent mostly to DJs), which feels and sounds like the Beatles and makes more sense in relation to the film. CD Maximum (Russia) has issued a number of Beatles' two-fers, and \\"Get Back\\" is coupled with \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Transport yourself into Bob's bizarro-world and you will find that Modern Times means nothing is modern and everything is retro. In this new disc, Bob has morphed into a cowboy-western band leader who is intent on crossing many music genres and paying homage to many other artist styles. It works beyond expectation. This album is poetry in motion. It is unusually subtle and subdued for such a powerful piece of art. It is quite simply Bob's best album in thirty years.  <br /> <br />Modern Times features ten long tracks and covers a lot of ground. It begins with what is destined to be the most popular song on the album, Thunder on the Mountain, which is a classic Bob Dylan tune that includes interludes of guitar riffs paying tribute to Chuck Berry and all the great guitarists of the Fifties. The disc also includes two good tunes, Spirit on the Water and Nettie Moore, with vocal sounds remarkably similar to Leon Redbone. In the latter song, Bob even admits to being in a \\"cowboy band.\\" The ultimate cowboy-country tribute goes down in the song When The Deal Goes Down which I like to call \\"the best song Willie Nelson never wrote.\\"  <br /> <br />The musicians used on this new album do an incredible job mixing and matching with Bob. He has praised them in an interview as his best band ever. Although we have come to expect faint praise in media interviews, we never expect that from Bob and he has evidence on this disc to support his assertion. All my bias toward The Band aside, this new band does a better job of synchronizing with Bob for his purposes. The result is marvelous. Check out the very subtle riffs on Someday Baby and you will hear a great band playing as if Bob had asked them to play the \\"Allman Brothers-on-Valium.\\" <br /> <br />Two other classics grace this disc. One is Workingman's Blues #2. This pays homage to Merle Haggard and is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by Bob. The other is Ain't Talkin' where Bob pays homage to himself by crafting anothersubtle classic tune. This great song caps off the disc and leaves us all wondering how it is possible for this man to write and perform great songs for thirty-five years. The very good most recent albums of Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft were not aberrations, merely preludes to this incredible Modern Times.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|For friends fans this collection is fab....possibly my 18yr old daughter's favourite birthday present this year, and certainly in her 'all time top 5'! Nicely presented with a few extra bits and pieces, it is everything it is advertised to be. Competitive price and arrived v promptly.....by the time you've seen all the dvds, you've forgotten how the first one went, and it's time to watch again. If 'Friends' is your 'cup of tea' this provides endless entertainment!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is the second release of the Neil Young Archive - Performance Series, but it is titled as \\"#3\\", apparently based on the eventual chronology of the entire series. This series is being released one performance at a time. This new disc is based on solo acoustic shows at Massey Hall in Toronto in January 1971.  <br /> <br />The Massey Hall performance is the perfect counterweight to first Performance release last year of Live at the Fillmore East (from 1970). These two concerts were only ten months apart, but they represent the hard and soft extremes of Neil Young. They were both performed in the midst of an incredible 24-month period that resulted in the release of five popular albums, with three different groups, plus a hit single that became the anti-war anthem of an entire generation. As pleasantly surprised as I was at the first release, this second release is even more amazing. <br /> <br />Live at Massey Hall represents the pinnacle of the confessional singer-songwriter era. I must admit that I have always personally preferred the Crazy Horse-style improvisational screaming-guitar cowboy rock & roll side of Neil. As such, the thought of another solo acoustic performance did not exactly create excitement. I was very wrong. This 17 song set of material is simply mesmerizing.  <br /> <br />Only seven of the seventeen songs had yet become familiar to the audience at Massey Hall in January 1971. Even the songs that we now have heard performed in numerous different settings appear fresh in this context. The more casual fans will be pleased with these selections and the serious fans have other reasons to absorb this special concert.  <br /> <br />First, the acoustics in the hall and the quality of the recording are astounding. It literally sounds as if you are sitting next to Neil during the concert. Secondly, there are unfamiliar gems, such as Bag Fog of Loneliness, a song that should have been released on one of the albums of the early 70's, but never made it. Thirdly, listening to parts of this concert makes you feel as if you are in the middle of his songwriting process, not only because of his \\"introductions/explanations\\", but mostly because of two famous songs that are combined together with lyrics unfamiliar to us. Finally and most importantly - despite Neil's prolific expertise at numerous instruments - even a diehard fan will be surprised at the one instrument that stands above all others on this disc. <br /> <br />Neil Young has been a successful artist, despite his frequent attempts to reject success. Nevertheless his casual critics usually object to the sound of his unique voice. Even many hardcore fans often prefer his songwriting or his guitar work and tend to minimize the vocal aspects of his music. Surprisingly, this Live at Massey Hall is quite simply a vocal masterpiece. Neil uses his voice in this concert as if it were a Stradivarius violin. I had always assumed that the unusually great vocal sound on the After the Gold Rush album was merely the result of the use of multi-tracking and expert sound engineers. However, this concert proves the sound was real and that, perhaps, the multi-tracking and engineering might have actually hurt the quality of Gold Rush rather than helped it. Live at Massey Hall displays a strong, gifted, and limber voice that is remarkable <br /> <br />The songs on this disc run all the way from the Buffalo Springfield days to having never been released. There are two songs from Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, two songs from After the Gold Rush, five songs from Harvest, two songs from Time Fades Away, and even one from On the Beach. There is something here for everyone.  <br /> <br />The most attention will go to his combination of A Man Needs a Maid/Heart of Gold with altered lyrics. This is a fascinating experience and probably worth the price of the disc all by itself. The classic electric songs, Cowgirl in the Sand, Down by the River, and Ohio, are presented here in wonderfully scaled back acoustic versions. The oft forgotten See the Sky About To Rain is also special. Journey Through the Past and Helpless are crowd pleasers for the Canadian audience at the hall and to the listener today. It is not necessary to discuss each and every song because all seventeen songs are noteworthy. <br /> <br />As noted, the vocal instrument is highlighted here more than any other, although his guitar and piano work are both prominent. Neil is undoubtedly a great performer. He has dazzled audiences for decades with his freak-like ability to play multiple instruments simultaneously. Yet, despite his peak performance in this concert, nothing stands out as much as his songwriting. There have always been great performers in Rock & Roll - the likes of Elvis Presley come to mind - but the ranks of great songwriters is considerably thinner. Neil Young deserves to be ranked alongside Lennon/McCartney, Bob Dylan, and the other classic songwriters of all time. This disc helps even the most familiar fan appreciate Neil's ability to prolifically write notes and lyrics together in a special way.

1842431145|5.0|I'd heard so much about this one that I opened it with impossibly high expectations.<br /><br />Then the bugger met them.<br /><br />On the surface, it's the story of a getaway driver who finds himself entangled with bad folks after he's double-crossed. But where the book shines is not just the story--though that is relentless--but in the depth of psychological insight and existential bent. If Camus wrote crime fiction (well, okay, he sort of did, but you get what I mean), it might read something like DRIVE. I powered through it in an afternoon, and found myself torn between awe and envy.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|The year is 2027, seeming the last days of the human race.  No child has been born in the past 18 years and the youngest person on the planet has just died at age 18.  This provocative film by director Alfonso Cuaron is science fiction action thriller that in many ways mirrors our world and the direct we might be headed.  There are many under lying theme in this film, global warming, medicated society overly processed foods, mass sickness, our dependency of science and our growing distaste for organized religion terrorism and fanaticism as well as illegal immigration and what it does to and for society.<br /><br />With all those plot points floating just under the surface it's hard to have a social commentary about these subjects without getting smacked in the face with it, but somehow this director pulls it off.  These themes are not preached to us in the film, we see them quite sparcely and the effects of them are briefly touched on, but little dialog or character diatribes are given.  It shows us the world and why and lets the audience fill in the gaps.  It's a gritty, dirty film with realistic violence that seems like you could be watching the news as much a movie.<br /><br />Many people debate the problems that this film focuses on and many more people like to point to a film like this as \\"left wing propaganda\\".  I really don't see it in this film... but then again I'm not looking for it.  I guess if you wanna look for a left wing slant in a political driven movie your likely to find it but this movie leave much commentary to be said.<br /><br />The director does a wonderful job pacing the movie with long takes and limited cuts, many action scenes go on for many minutes never cutting.  You really get immersed in the world that might be set in the future but feels very real. The style really makes you feel uneasy and anxious for the characters and the situation.  Lots of action without feeling like an action movie, never glorifying the violence with amazing action scenes or face paces cuts.  It's dusty, dirty and uncomfortably plausible view of man on man violence.  I really liked the set designs and the elements of technology that, like humans, seem to have stop evolving and all look out of date without being retro or archaic. Clive Owen carries the movie and really shows some range with the depth of his character who is a hero, even if he's a slightly inept and unwilling one.<br /><br />There are many things about this movie that make you wonder about the other aspects of human life if you knew there was no future for the human race it's self.  What would it be like to live in a world with no children when everything in the year 2007 revolves around them and is marketed with the family in mind?  No children playing no laughter, nothing to remind you of the innocence of a child.  What horrors we adults would bestow on one another without having to worry about influencing or raising a child.  Would morality and standard you set for your own existence go out the door?  This is one of many questions presented in this movie.<br /><br />A very unique take on an apocalyptic sci fi movie, where we don't meet our end by a war, meteor, nukes or another large catastrophe.  In this one the human race just kind of flickers and dribbles to its demise.  Interesting notionamazing action scenes or face paces cuts.  It's dusty, dirty and uncomfortably plausible view of man on man violence.  I really liked the set designs and the elements of technology that, like humans, seem to have stop evolving and all look out of date without being retro or archaic. Clive Owen carries the movie and really shows some range with the depth of his character who is a hero, even if he's a slightly inept and unwilling one. <br /> <br />There are many things about this movie that make you wonder about the other aspects of human life if you knew there was no future for the human race it's self.  What would it be like to live in a world with no children when everything in the year 2007 revolves around them and is marketed with the family in mind?  No children playing no laughter, nothing to remind you of the innocence of a child.  What horrors we adults would bestow on one another without having to worry about influencing or raising a child.  Would morality and standard you set for your own existence go out the door?   This is one of many questions presented in this movie. <br /> <br />A very unique take on an apocalyptic sci fi movie, where we don't meet our end by a war, meteor, nukes or another large catastrophe.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|This is just a great album.  Be warned: if you're not into progressive rock, stay away!  If you are, welcome aboard!  I can listen to every song a hundred times and never get tired of Counterparts (OK, OK, maybe not \\"Nobody's Hero\\").  But the rest of the album is fantastic.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are \\"Double Agent\\" and \\"Leave That Thing Alone!\\" two great songs that, for some reason, go well back-to-back.  I don't know why...  Also, I love \\"Cut to the Chase,\\" \\"Alien Shore\\" and \\"Between Sun and Moon\\"  Three great songs.  My favorite song on the whole album, however, is \\"Everyday Glory.\\"  It is fantastic!
B0001Z52RU|3.0|Taking on a the plot gimmick of changing the past much like Bedazzled, Back to the future, or the TV show Quantum Leap. This isn't new territory, but this movie takes a fresh approach to the theme of changing the past and how it never works.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffered severe traumas as a boy copes with the pain by blacking out at moments of high stress. While searching for an answer to heal his emotional wounds, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals and focuses on those moments, he travels back in time, and is able to essentially fix parts of his past. There are consequences to his every choices.  His alternate futures vary from frat boy to prisoner to amputee. As he continues to do this, His intentions are in the right place, the actions he takes always have unintended consequences. You know what coming from there, the butterfly effect becomes the snowball effect.<br /><br />The story takes many leaps of faith and if you can get past the idea of being about to go back in time just by thinking about it you can enjoy it on some level.  Ashton Kutcher does a decent job, noting that blows you away but he does what's necessary to move the story along.  The supporting cast does about the same, just enough.  The concept has some value and the situations are interesting and somewhat predictable.  But when dealing with a movie like this where everything gets worse then gets tied up by the happy theatrical ending seems to not fit with what this film should have been. I know there is another ending but this review focuses on the original,(The Director's cut of the movie adds some amount of depth to the storyline, but differs only a little from the theatrical version of the film, as well as providing a bit more detailed look at Evan's ability) The directors cut ending is more fitting but still is a bit of a stretch, it works well to tie up some lose ends and try's to paint a certain picture about the character but still seems kinda funky to me.  I liked many things about this movie but disliked about as much.  The movie gets very repetitive and slightly predictable. The scenes with the children were a stretch and a bit to over the top for my tastes in this film.  The level of intensity never really hit it's peak that was needed.  this is a film that i can see where they were going with it and wasn't that far off, but in the end just fell short of a home run.  I think with a better director and maybe a more seasoned dramatic actor this film could have reached for something more than the popcorn movie that it is. This movie is based to much in the \\"real world\\" to really sell most of these over the top ideas and situations, if it was done more in the vein of lets say a 12 Monkeys where the reality is slightly surreal and blurred as well as the theme of psychosis that the main character isn't really experiencing what he thinks he is.  This is just my opinion of course but never really felt in the movie.  It's worth a watch and if you can get into the movies ideas you'll enjoy it on some level.<br /><br />I will mention that I'm a big Sci Fi fan and this movie was nominated for the prestigious Saturn award for best Sci Fi film in 2004 It lost to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and should have.funky to me.

B0000931QA|5.0|It's always fascinated me when \\"stuffy\\" rock journalists criticize Concept albums. In my opinion a good Concept album is even more difficult to create than a \\"normal\\" album simply because it requires a coherent story line. And a good concept album is closer to pure art than a normal album because it can be readily turned into a book, play or even a movie (think of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or The Who's \\"Tommy\\").<br /><br />And I think \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" is one of the best, not quite up there with \\"The Wall\\" but I personally like it even more than \\"Tommy\\" simply because it's more \\"my kind of music\\". Tommy, after all, is really rock Opera and I don't really like Opera!!! In fact I don't like a lot of sides 3 & 4 of The Wall either, for the same reason. Mindcrime is not just pure rock, it's really good progressive influenced Heavy Metal!!!<br /><br />And many of the songs also stand alone just fine, \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" is my personal favorite and one of my all time favorite songs period. \\"Revolution Calling\\", the title track, \\"The Needle Lies\\", \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" and the center piece; \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" are also standouts.<br /><br />In fact, this was turned into a \\"movie\\" which was really more of a collection of MTV styled videos, which, unfortunately, is missing some songs (guess they had a limited budget and decided to spend it on quality rather than make videos for every single song) but the story still flows well. This came out on VHS before the \\"Operation Livecrime\\" box set, a couple of the videos were shown on MTV at the time and I have never seen a DVD of it, though they did release \\"Livecrime\\" on DVD.<br /><br />As for the band, I have always thought Scott Rockenfield is one of THE great overlooked drummers and Chris DeGarmo is sadly missed and his absence (especially his compositional skills) had a very apparent effect on the band as a whole. And Geoff Tate has one of THE great voices in rock PERIOD.<br /><br />The band also released a companion follow-up, \\"Operation Mindcrime II\\" in 2006 and I have seen a lot of criticism of it because it's not as good. Well, come on folks, how could it be?!? I personally feel it IS a worthy companion to this original. Even if it's not as good as the original, it's still better than a lot of the stuff out there masquerading as prog-metal!! So I would tell anyone who does like this original to shell out a few $$ for a used version of the new one.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like rock at all, in any form, you should already own this album!!!mpanion follow-up, \\"Operation Mindcrime II\\" in 2006 and I have seen a lot of criticism of it because it's not as good.

B000HC2LIK|5.0|BladerunnerIt's a toss up for the best Sci fi film of all times.  The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings, physically identical to adult humans, called replicants are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth's \\"off-world colonies.\\" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny. Specialist police units -- blade runners -- hunt down and \\"retire\\" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment. This movie I believe helped to inpire many clone and cyborg type movies like A.I. The story is so ahead of it's time and one of those rare movies that is as good today as it was in 1982 and is almost more relivant. Well fleshed out characters, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a commando, Leon a soldier and manual laborer, Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) a sex worker retrained as an assassin, and Pris (Daryl Hannah) a \\"basic pleasure model.\\" Bryant also explains that the Nexus-6 model has a four-year lifespan as a failsafe against their developing unstable emotions. Deckard is teamed up with Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) young secretary Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant (who believes she is a human) with implanted memories from Tyrell's niece, which provide a cushion for her emotions. I'm a character guy and believe it is imposable to have a great film without many stong multi fasited characters with more that a few layers. Lastly like any great film it is very thought provoking and leaves a lot to the viewer imagination. Many critics and movie goes hated this film for that reason but for the rest of us the compelling question of weather or not Deckard is a replicant is just that thing that makes the movie great. Oh, just so you know...Of course he is, you silly goose!<br /><br />This is one of those movies that holds up to almost anything made today.  the directing, acting effects, and characters are all spot on.  The movie made Rutger Hauer a career as someone to be afraid of.is a replicant is just that thing that makes the movie great.

B000002KFJ|5.0|This album usually gets forgotten about in the Sabbath catalog, but I have always really liked it.  It's worth it for two of Sabbath's greatest epic songs, Megalomania and The Writ.  Megalomania clocks in at 9 1/2 minutes, and has one of Ozzy's most vibrant, weariest vocals ever.  The Writ is another epic track, around 8:45 or so, and it's one of those classic Sabbath song with a great riff and another great vocal by Ozzy.  Ozzy could actually sing before he became a poster boy for drug abuse.  The song Am I Going Insane (Radio) is really good too.  Many of Sabbath tracks stretch the ears, which they are never really given credit for.  Sabbath isn't putting out complex prog rock like ELP and Yes, but it's still pretty ambitious for a band that usually just gets lumped in by critics as a bunch of drugged out heavy metal guys.  War Pigs, Hand of Doom, Solitude, Warning, and Born Again are just several examples of this epic musicianship, and I don't think it was ever done any better than in Sabotage.  The band still really had it together on this one, and started to lose it (well, let's be honest, Ozzy was losing it mostly) on Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die.  This is Sabbath's last great album with the original lineup.  We'd have to wait until Heaven and Hell for another great Sabbath album.
0553584537|3.0|I picked this book up because I came across the publicity for \\"Hide\\", Lisa Gardner's latest release.  Being more than somewhat pedantic with my reading habits, I HAD to find and read the 'first' in the series.  Which brings me to 'Alone'.   <br /> <br />'Alone' was probably first written as a 'one-off' outside of Gardners other series which features, I believe, a pair of cops.  I hadn't come across these books before, but they seem to review well and I will definitely be picking them up in the future.  After writing 'Alone', Gardner has gone back to this original series and then come back with a follow-up in 'Hide'. <br /> <br />'Alone' is very well written.  The main character is probably Bobby Dodge, a police sniper on Boston's STOP team.  His job is to take a position at the scene of an incident and report to the team on the ground.  His main task is obviously to kill if necessity dictates: 'take a life to save a life'.  In this case, he takes a life and saves 2: a woman called Catherine Gagnon and her son Nathan.  Her husband, Jimmy, was about to pull the trigger on his wife, or so Dodge's instincts told him, forcing Dodge to act as he has been carefully trained to do in such a situation.   <br /> <br />From this point on, and this is virtually the first scene in the book, life gets very very complicated for Bobby Dodge.  He is immediately investigated (and suspended) for the shooting, as you would expect, by his department and the DAs office.  But there are complications.  Suddenly the wife of the victim is contacting him and asking for his help.  Doubts begin to surface about the shooting.  Did Catherine Gagnon set Bobby up to shoot her abusive husband?   <br /> <br />The shooting also sparks a chain of deaths around Catherine Gagnon, who emerges as a main character in her own right.  She is a complicated character, the survivor of an horrific childhood abduction that lasted for 28 days where she was held underground in the dark and sexually abused.  She was eventually found and released and went on to identify her abductor and testify in court.  The abductor, Richard Umbrio, was sentenced and jailed. <br /> <br />\\"Alone\\" unravels a nasty and complicated family history that Catherine Gagnon has unwittingly stepped into (or has she?).  It would appear that the wealthy and influential parents of her dead husband want Catherine dead and gone.  They work quickly to disempower her: cancelling her bank accounts and contesting custody of their grandchild being the least of it.  They also manage to find a 'loophole' in the law that allows them to pursue Dodge for murder through the court system.  I found this to be a little untenable.  Surely the police would be protected in the rare instance that they have to use fatal force in the line of duty.  Dodge's conduct becomes even more suspicious to his team mates as he gets involved with the manipulative and mysterious Catherine. <br /> <br />The only other criticism I have concerns 'tenability'.  I found the motive for the extreme action taken by Catherine Gagnon's in-laws to be questionable.  In the end, the in-laws motive is basically self-preservation, I won't say what they are hiding, but the action they take, at their age seems a little too extreme.  Gardner covers for some of this by creating a snowball effect; what at first seems like a simple and careful solution soon becomes messy and out of control. Dealing with the dark side always comes at a price.  <br /> <br />However, I think Lisa Gardner is really onto something with these characters.  They certainly warrant another book.  Its refreshing to see a characer like Catherine Gagnon who despite her dark side, is still a proactive survivor of horrific abuse.  Perhaps this is how one survives such an incident. And of course she is a mother who goes to extreme lengths to protect her child in the face of suspicion cast upon her for her actions.  Gardner does well here, introducing the subject of Munchausens via Proxy, a rarepsychological condition where a parent 'makes' a child sick in order to gain positive attention for themselves.    Catherine Gagnon is definitely not likeable, but she is certainly very interesting, which in turn makes for great possibilities for Gardner in her follow up, \\"Hide\\".  At the end of 'Alone' the reader would wonder how the author could extract even more from this story, but she does indeed go on to do so in \\"Hide\\". <br /> <br />I gave this book 3 stars, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to rate \\"Hide\\" more highly.  The characters are intriguing and believable and the tension Gardner creates is sustained throughout.  Both books are hard to put down, so be prepared to dig in for the long haul.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is an amazing album, possibly my favorite along all the Beatles albums.  Many criticise it for being \\"incoherent\\", but that is one thing I just do not agree with.  It may seem like a mess on the surface, but it has one of those deep, inner logic vibes to it.  It's chock full of great songs, with all kinds of moods and feelings.  It's the most eclectic album in The Beatles's career, and possibly the most eclectic album in rock history.  Where can you go from the sheer intensity (or agony, depending on your point of view) of Helter Skelter and Yer Blues, to the gentle, sad beauty of Good Night and While My Guitar Gently Weeps, to the pure pop of Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da and Birthday, then to top that all off, the avant garde genius of Revolution #9?  You can't.  And, yes, Yoko detractors, I dig Revolution #9, which undoubtedly Ms. Ono had a part in.  It's not the greatest track on the album, but it is certainly the most adventurous, and worth listening to over and over again.  Some of my favorite tracks...Everybody's Got Something to Hide except for Me and My Monkey, Good Night, Revolution #9, Birthday, Don't Pass Me By, etc., etc..  It's just another amazing album by the world's greatest band, that's all...

In almost every film, the acting is superb, and the special f-x are exceptional for the time.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|I was very excited to see this movie. The previews looked fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie was awful. The plot was long and drawn out. The first half of the movie was so boring that my husband and I talked about walking out. We decided to stay, in hopes that it would improve, and it did eventually. The end was very good. But I wouldn't waste my money.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|I bought this primarily for the Roadhouse Blues outtakes, just one of those favorite songs , hoping to hear some new guitar riff or keyboard solo , but knowing fully well a drunken Jim could render them worthless.<br /><br />  I jumped right to the bonus tracks and was half right, Jim was still out there and pretty difficult to work with and get the best out of him, you can just see by how many takes it took for this cut to evolve, solely because Jim coudn't find a groove or his brains for that matter.<br /><br />  I first purchased this as an lp in the early seventies, it was my 1st doors lp and my favorite, getting countless spins on the turntable and Morrison was a God, little did I know what a jackass he really was and all the credit should go to Robbie, Ray and John for making this lp the classic that it is.<br /><br />  So then this is one of those things I should be reviewing with all the listening time I put into it. Again I purchased it primarily for the bonus material, I thought that Manzarek had done a great job with all the previous remasters and that the original lp would have little or no improvement. I was dead wrong and not prepared for how amazing this album sounds ,truly remixed and remastered, this is what the doors really wanted to put out, hands down. All the cool harmonica, guitar licks and keyboards , and Jim screams, edited  out of the original album inserted to give this a much harder and rocking edge than any version ever produced, my hats off again to the living Doors for this gem. I will be wearing out this copy. You won't believe your listening to the same album , I mean it!<br /><br />  Side note, while purchasing this cd in the store it would not scan to register the sale, the girl asked for assistance and remarked how all the doors 40th anniversary cds were not scanning properly, I remarked it must be the ghost of Jim upset about not getting any of the royalties, too bad Jim, you should have hung around a little longer.Hope the other 40th anniversary cds are just as amazing, I'll be waiting for your reviews,oh hell with it why don't I just get a couple more tomorrow.<br /><br />Let it roll , baby, roll, allnight long!sary cds are just as amazing, I'll be waiting for your reviews,oh hell with it why don't I just get a couple more tomorrow. <br /> <br /> <br />Let it roll , baby, roll, allnight long!
B000N3ST9I|5.0|'The Blackening'(MH's 6th studio album) hits you right in the face and doesn't stop. A step in a different direction is what Robb & the boys have accomplished with 'The Blackening'. An unrelenting thrash attack with hooks, killer riffs and great arrangements. Machine Head has really stepped it up on this one....far more then what they had accomplished with 'Through The Ashes Of Empires' which also stands as a metal masterpiece. The main difference between the two is the distinctive sound of......Thrash. Incorporating their roots (which are 80's Bay Area thrash) Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel have come full circle. Once before bandmates in the thrash group Violence, Robb and Phil are back with a true old school dual guitar attack that doesn't sound dated in the least bit. Agressive and exciting are there soloing efforts.....back and forth between the two.........really awesome stuff. Many influences are heard throughout the album which include Metallica,Exodus, Slayer, Black Sabbath,Pantera and Iron Maiden. And the lyrics are well written with many words of our dismal future. Top notch metal is what you are going to get with MH's 'The Blackening'. An album that exceeds 60 minutes in length on only 8 tracks.......wow.  DIE FOR AMERICA
B000GG4Y32|4.0|This is a great film if you love history and are a fan of Keaton, Nicholson and Beatty...they are great in this film and the history behind it is amazing...Beatty captures the emotions of the era.  Besides the wonderful acting by Keaton (in my opinion one of her best films) and the cinematography, the interviews with the people who knew Louise Bryant and Jack Reed bring this film to life!
B000068OCS|5.0|I love this movie! Very creative. Makes you think and derive meaning from a number of different scenes. The music is also fantastic.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|I'm not going to lie, when I say that this movie had so much more potential. Gerard Butler is an excellent actor, but the script for this movie was weak. Therefore, he did not perform to his full potential. If you read the story in school about Beowulf, the movie will let you down. I just wish Hollywood could understand this when they make big budget movies. The actor Gerard Butler is just now being recognized for his work in 300. I noticed his potential in Dracula 2000. He pours himself into the characters he portrays. I just think it was sad for him to waste his time in Beowulf.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Incredible! Fabulous! Phenomenal! Since receiving this CELTIC WOMAN LIVE AT SLANE CASTLE DVD, I have not only all but wore this out but also got to catch CELTIC WOMAN live in concert (in Uncasville, CT and Nashville, TN). They are unbelievable! I can't get enough. In fact, rather than flying back to Connecticut after the Nashville show, as I was scheduled to do, I instead got on a plane for Raleigh, NC, to see them two more times there! (In Raleigh, ROW A both nights, literally four feet from the edge of the Stage and six feet from the girls)! Now, having seen CELTIC WOMAN live in concert four times, in a matter of three weeks time no less, all I can say is ... oh my God! Angels! If you have any kind of heart at all, how on earth can you NOT fall in love with these six Angels? Angels sent straight from Heaven. Unbelievable voices and talent! Wonderful performers. All the lovely ladies of CELTIC WOMAN possess much talent and all have done tons of work of this very nature. They all have solo albums, some have performed in theatre and does it ever show when they are on stage, right before your very eyes. Tremendously beautiful ladies, tremendously beautiful voices, stunning gowns worn by the ladies. The stage sets and backdrops and all the lighting is incredible! David Downes has done a remarkable job. CELTIC WOMAN has in fact opened up a whole new world to me, a world of new music as well as a world of Irish/Celtic/Gaelic history. Buy their CDS and DVDS (especially the most recent ... Live At Slane Castle DVD) ... AND ... go see them live, if you possibly can, while they are still (as of this writing) on Tour all over the USA and Canada. This is remarkable talent folks. You could not have imagined voices so beautiful could ever exist. I never fell in love with any musical performers as fast as I did these lovely, talented ladies. Watch, listen, absorb, learn and ... enjoy.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|BLUF: If you're the kind of character who thinks that any movie with lots of blood and profanity is \\"cool,\\" then you're twelve...and you would probably enjoy this movie - or at least the status it will give you when you tell all of your school friends that you ACTUALLY saw it. <br /> <br />This movie was carried on the backs of Hollywood heavy-hitters, and that's why the film and Scorsese got an award for it.  Period.  A movie with old-timers like Sheen, Nicholson and Baldwin and in vogue faces like Damon, Wahlberg and Dicaprio will NOT fail to be well acted.  So hats off to those guys.  Great job, and frankly, I would have expected no less.   <br /> <br />So why the \\"cheap tricks\\" title, you ask?  Scorsese's method for manipulating our emotions and jarring his audience is reminiscent of the Hollywood flop \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" when the only redeeming quality of the movie was suddenly and needlessly snatched from our lives by the jaws of a great white.  [SPOILER FOLLOWS] No duh, Scorsese...if you kill the main character DEAD, the underdog - the guy we've been cheering for the whole time, without even one blood-gurgling last word, you WILL move your audience one way or another; it's no secret formula - it's a cheap trick.  It would have taken more talent..or simply more thought...to move your audience while maintaning some sense of justice, and I'm not talking about street justice or revenge.   <br /> <br />[END SPOILER] <br /> <br />You wanna retell the story of some epic tragedy in history with an epic film?  Fine...make it unjust.  You wanna expose to the world the corruption of some trusted office for our enlightenment that it may never happen again?  Go ahead, make the violence and gore true to life.  But if you just want to entertain me with a movie about a single crooked cop and a crazy old mob leader in Boston, then at least make it just.  If you're not trying to enlighten me or inspire me, then at least satisfy me while I'm being entertained; otherwise, you're wasting my time.

0374105235|5.0|The first half of the book, I was getting confused with \\"What is the What\\", they were all on the journey away from wars.  The second half when the author became a child soldier, it is so sad, so scary, so brutal, but that is the world we're in.  I understand the UN is trying to get some child soldiers out of wars, but are there more we can do?

After a lightning storm, their Number 5 leaves the group and heads into town, realizing he's alive. Is he alive? That's up to Stephanie Smith (Ally Sheedy) and Number 5's creator (Steve Gutenberg) to find out. <br /> <br />I found it a bit hard to sit through when I was a kid, but \\"Short Circuit\\" isn't too bad. The robot is cute and the plot is fairly engaging. Worth a look for fans of robots.
B0006JGFNQ|1.0|Never received product.  Received and email instead stating that the product was returned to the seller in a \\"damaged\\" condition.  Was very disappointed in this....
B000C20VPA|5.0|Casino is a great movie.  It is one movie that you will wish to watch over and over.  Robert DiNero is perfect in his role as Nick Weinstein - he is tough and sometimes also tender.  Sharon Stone plays the perfect slut-wife.  Joe Pescci is a pathetic scoundrel, completely devoid of conscience and character (you don't want to meet him in an alley, or anywhere, for that matter).  This movie is all-in-all among the greatest gangster movies ever made.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Like the \\"Pepsi Challenge\\" concept someone mentioned below...I can't recall ever playing Clutch for someone and them not liking it.<br /><br />I caught Neil and the boys at CenterStage here in Atlanta a few weeks ago and this album really represents well what they're doing live now.  They've grown - and yes, their style has changed a bit from TNS and the early albums - but it fits me well as I've grown from Slayer/Megadeth/Metallica/SOD etc to where I am now.<br /><br />These guys rock.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  A GREAT backyard BBQ/Crab Boil album.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I'm sure by now its been said so many times by other reviewers: its an excellent movie.  It has a powerful story, and great characters.  If you don't end up buying it here, I strongly suggest you rent it.
0805066691|5.0|Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is truly a classic piece of history.  It tells the tale of the ravages that can result from the doctrine of Manifest Destiny.  In the case of the Native Americans, Manifest Destiny resulted in the near-destruction of a way of life that was whole and complete.  This is the point that Dee Brown makes.  He tells the story from a stilted perspective, but this masterpiece fills a void that exists in our understanding of American history.  This void is magnified by the very brief bits of U.S. history that introduce each chapter.  We are (at least vaguely) familiar with these pieces of history, which makes our ignorance of the history of the \\"taming\\" of the West even more appalling.  This is a great and important book that should be read by all.
B00006JIA4|4.0|While this is not the completely definitive collection as some of the purists in other reviews would want, this is exactly what I wanted.  I do not have any other Queen recordings and I was looking for a package that contained as much as possible in a single set.  I am listening to this almost exclusively in the month since I received it and I am not worn out yet. <br />If you don't have any Queen and you want to buy just one set, this will cover just about everything.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is the obvious omission of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" and a couple of recording level issues on a couple of tracks, notably \\"We will rock you, We are the Champions\\" which are strangely muted relative to most of the other tracks.
B000002UJQ|1.0|ughhh.....even hearing Radiohead's name makes me drowsy. I have to give it you Radiohead fans, your a hardcore bunch. I cant imagine how tough it is to stay awake during this album. You must all inhale a couple of lines before even thinking about listening to this.<br /><br />As for you non-Radiohead listeners, dont believe the hype. All because MTV, your best friend, and mommy and daddy tells you its good, it doesnt mean it is.<br /><br />I suggest Tiamat and Omnium Gatherum over this.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|There's little to be said that hasn't been included in the \\"Spotlight\\" reviews. I bought the DVD because of the universal acclaim, as well as the fact that I enjoy good sci-fi. Well, this isn't so much sci-fi as much as a warning (as is most sci-fi); it could be a great argument for pro-life, and the repercussions are well examined. Clive Owen is absolutely perfect, a man who knows his limits but is caught up in something that his own sensibilities can't fathom. He doesn't know what's happening around him, but he has a solid sense of right & wrong. To try to explain more would be redundant, since previous reviewers have nailed the power of the film. The art direction is amazing in its bleakness, and the stunning cinematography can't be equalled. I've thought of this film many times since I watched it, but it may take a few days before I watch it again. Some of the images are in my head forever. This film requires concentration. I wish I could've seen it on the big screen. The DVD extras are plentiful and insightful. An amazing film achievement. Bravo, Senor Cuaron.
078322737X|4.0|ok, i was 19 when i first saw this in the movies so it had a special impact. seeing it now in middle age it is not as powerful, but can still be appreciated on its own terms: well written, well acted, well directed, andof course that score makes one think (incorrectly) that the early days of rock-n-roll were some sort of era of musical magic. <br />
B00006AUIG|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie. Especially when I went through the special features. What I found out was totally amazing. That this hospital was a real hospital with history of lobotomy and being haunted as well. Being very much into the paranormal in my life, it was very interesting to me to hear about the actors \\"experiences\\" in the making of this movie. Also, the records that are shown in the movie were also there. They never did take the records out and destroy them when the hosptial closed. It was told it was like the hospital just shut down and didn't take anything with them that was there. This movie became more real and scarey to me after I watched the special features. See the movie, and see for yourself. It is a \\"very different\\" movie in how it was made. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes thriller movies with lots of twists.
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|there are few more excruciating experiences than sitting thru a work of \\"art\\". this pretentious overblown (lame pun intended) tripe from 40 years ago is almost as painful to watch as \\"zabriskie point\\"; i daresay that i wouldrather sit thru \\"mchales navy joins the air force\\" than this! why would anybody take antonioni seriously? but even more irritating than the movie itself is the commentary track by some purported antonioni \\"scholar\\". david hemmings career is non-existent nowadays, and vanessa redgrave has managed to live this down (hey, if you can survive \\"camelot\\" you can survive anything). if this was swinging london in the 60s, im glad i was in new york! <br />
B00005NGAL|4.0|The product came quickly. It was exactly as advetised and met expectations. Thank You.
0792839749|5.0|My kids just love this movie.  It is a classic that never gets old!
B000JVT09C|3.0|Video was superb for the newest installment of the superman saga.  Movie as a whole, I liked it.  It's a modern superman vs what we have seen or remembered from christopher reeve's superman.  Some people don't like it but I believe it was due to their own high expectations that let them down.   <br /> <br />Warner gave both hd-dvd and blu-ray the same VC-1 video transfer.  Yet gave hd-dvd TrueHD and to blu-ray the regular dolby digital 5.1.  HD-DVD double layer is only 30 gigs vs blu-ray's 50 gigs.  Blu-ray have 20 gigs more to provide to Warner, yet they chose to just screw us.  They could have easily left TrueHD in it and put countless dolby digital, DTS, or even lossless PCM audio for those players who do not support TrueHD.  This seems like an intentional move by warner so I am only rating this blu-ray 3 stars due to their strategy.
1401207138|5.0|The absolute edition is the best incarnation of Watchmen EVER. Buy it now before the movie comes out and this product won`t be found anymore.<br /><br />:o)
B000KJU182|5.0|Billy Budd was Terence Stamp's movie debut and what a tremendous debut it was. Finally we have an excellent transfer to DVD of this exceptional movie - the extras are limited to a commentary and a contemporary trailer but it is the move that matters - buy and enjoy!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I am a purveyor of all nominated, acclaimed , movies, etc..... <br /> <br />Babel, as is the style and \\"fad\\" today with modern directors, has many storylines going on simultaneously, of which we are waiting to see just what their connection actually is:  well, forget about it in this film! The connections are so flimsy, and so circumstantial, as to render the whole concept of the movie useless..... <br /> <br />The details, of the Japanese \\"sub-story\\" are so irrelevant to the main plot of the movie, and , in fact, if you combine the actions of this underage Japanese girl, along with the actions of one of the young sisters of the Moroccan family, I am starting to think that this director has some personal issues of his own, as he seems to be fascinated with, or have a fetish about lurid Child behavior.  <br /> <br />In addition to all that, there are several \\"cop-outs\\" by the director: when you already have an overlong, and overblown movie, I wonder where you draw the line on where to not show something, when you have already spent endless meaningless minutes ( ie: the Mexican weddding), so that you don't have the time to show us how the Children were found... <br /> <br />and the ultimate cop-out was not even letting us \\"see\\" the words of the letter written by the Japanese girl to the policeman.  <br /> <br />at some point, you have to get over the notion that all things esoterical are great art: at some point, a crazy patchwork of art on canvas is simply NOT a painting on par with the old masters. And similarly, just because you string together a bunch of seemingly unrelated stories in a movie, it doesn't have to mean that you have \\"great vision\\", or have done something wonderful.
B00004SA8A|5.0|Absolutely must have for true music lover and particularly the music of  Schubert. This is already an old recording but still stands up the comparison with later, newer CD's ( Brendel, Schiff,Lupu, Perahia). Kempff, the old master, now deceased, left a memorable,moving and romantic in spirit rendition of Schubert Piano Sonatas (the first complete set). I heard Kempff performed in live, and always thought of him as the greatest German Romantic Pianist. <br />This set is the work of true love.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie dont promotes \\"freedom fighters\\" or some kind of race against race battle or -like some of the critics have said- It's not propoganda of any kind; it's just the result of the mix of a comic book, a personal fantasy version of the real facts and historical events, PERIOD. <br /> <br />I'ts OK if some of you don't agree with me, but from my point of view, some of the critics are just nonsense. Worse, it's nonsense perpetuated by the media just so they have something to write about. <br /> <br />If you want pure, un-adultered historical facts... please, be my guest and read a History book. <br /> <br />But, If you want to buy an oversized popcorn, a double size coke and just wanna enjoy the movie... Welcome to the Club, 'cause this is not madness... this is SPARTA!!! <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I think the movie was sensationally written based on the Broadway theatrical play and not surprisingly, they could not have found a better cast for the movie.  The movie is an innovative view of people residing in New York's East Village and how they are dealing with their lives and the lives of their friends.  The reality comes in when they all have to deal with the issue of AIDS and how it affects al of their lives.  There are the good times and the bad but everything has to be taken in stride.  From Roger, the struggling songwriter, to Mark, the stressed filmmaker; everyone in between adds their own flare and character to the whole setting.   <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was filled with issues that are hard to deal with but are more apparent in the movie.  Struggling through everything that life throws at you, while having your friends there to help you through.
1416524800|3.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and I have to say that I think this one is my least favorite.  I think that it was a little too much at times and the ending was a bit rushed.  It was a good read nonetheless, especially if you are on a long plane ride/trip and have some free time.  However, it is no where near Angles & Demons or even Digital Fortress.  If you are a fan of Dan Brown you should definitely read this book, I am just not a fan of so much science lingo maybe..
0307237699|5.0|Like Hillary Clinton in 'Living History', I think Mr. Obama has certainly positioned himself for the presidency. In my opinion he has what it takes - intelligence,audacity, thoughtfulness, empathy, maturity, humility and above all a thorough understanding of the issues and an idea of how to deal with them. <br />Mr Obama is well aware of the media power. He speaks of a politician \\"looking like he believes\\" whether or not he believes - how straight talk counts less than whether it sounds straight on TV (128) but allows that with more participation from the electorate, the more integrity is rewarded. So yes, I get it ...it is EVERYONE'S responsibility to be well informed. <br />Obama showed his audacity and maturity when in a speech to 2000 people at Chicago's Federal Plaza, he denounced going to war in Iraq(295). It's mind boggling how prophetic that speech was. <br />I found this an educational and well thought out book. But in my soul I wonder...does America deserve such a treasure?
B000KRNCYY|4.0|Great Irish contemporary music.  The harps, pennywhistles and bodhran drums make you think of the Irish countryside.
B00005RIXP|2.0|If you are only interested in Eva Marton, then this production is great-for she is one of the great dramatic sopranos of our time. However, there are other characters and other voices in this opera that require consideration. This Scarpia is very good indeed, with a fine vocal instrument which he uses to full effect. Unfortunately, he looked like he was walking around the entire time with his eyes closed-which was a bit distracting. Furlan, as Mario, was badly miscast. This voice knows only loud and louder. There were noticeable vocal problems and musicianship was questionable at best. There was one very bad instance in the first act in which he was totally out of sinc with the orchestra. This is not what one expects from someone sharing the stage with Eva Marton. His acting was clumsy, especially in the 1st act, where he didn't seem to know what to do with his hands and arms. Overall the production was good, but what made it good was mainly Ms. Marton. That, however, was not enough for me to rate this version very highly. There are many other renditions with a uniformly strong cast.
0757302661|5.0|My husband and I read this book in preparation for our son's birth.  He is our first child, and I was looking for a birthing method that would help me through a natural childbirth.  We could not take any classes and so relied only on the techniques in the book.  I gave birth to him a week ago, and it was such an amazing experience, both for me and my husband.  With my husband's help, I was able to remain calm, relaxed, and focused throughout 13 hours of labor and 1.5 hours of \\"pushing\\".  No epidural, no medication, no tears, no fear, even though it did hurt.  I definitely recommend this book and method.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Stevie Wonder scored a coup with his 1980 album entitled Hotter Than July. Hotter Than July gives us Stevie at his best with a distinctly early 80's flavor to his music that still rocks well and sways today! Just one listen to this CD proves it.<br /><br />The CD opens with \\"Did I Hear You Say You Love Me;\\" this number has Stevie asking his woman to prove her love to him. The music rocks hard and I love those guitars! Stevie's voice is in excellent form, too! \\"All I Do\\" has a more R&B flavor as Stevie sings that he is falling deep and hard for his woman. It will charm you--for sure! The backup chorus enhances the beauty of this number, too. \\"Rocket Man\\" lets Stevie tell the story of a love gone awry; he uses the image of the two lovers rocketing toward the sky of love and then he falls suddenly back to earth as he expresses his chagrin over losing his woman. The drums and percussion do a great job on this number; and the strings add a lot to the musical arrangement as well.<br /><br />\\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\" has a catchy reggae beat as Stevie sings about peace coming to Zimbabwe. Sounds like a great reason to celebrate this song to me! Stevie's voice remains in excellent form and I liked the background vocals, too.<br /><br />\\"Do Like You\\" tells the sweet story of a young boy who surprises everyone by being a naturally talented dancer; the beat rocks hard and the background vocals shine on in this number once again.<br /><br />\\"Lately\\" is a rather sad but stunningly beautiful number about a love gone awry; and even though I hadn't listened to this album in years before yesterday I remembered the melody exactly the way I first heard it. \\"Lately\\" has a certain poignancy and beauty that I rarely hear in any song about love; the piano and Stevie's voice are sublime on this number! You feel truly sorry for Stevie's character as he sings this to perfection. \\"Lately\\" is a masterpiece that has been rather overlooked, in my opinion. Check this track out!<br /><br />\\"Happy Birthday\\" opens with a great musical intro and this song stands as Stevie's solid gold Happy Birthday wish to the legendary Martin Luther King, Jr. Unfortunately, at the time this album was released Dr. King's birthday was not yet a national holiday; one can only imagine the joy Stevie must have felt when Dr. King got his holiday--this number is stunning as Stevie and the backup chorus harmonize to perfection. You will remember this joyous and relentless upbeat number for ages to come; it's that good. It received a good amount of air time when it was first released, too.<br /><br />The liner notes give you the complete lyrics to the songs on this CD; and you get the song credits, too. The art work reflects great judgment and the digital remastering by Kevin Reeves leaves nothing to be desired! Great!<br /><br />I recommend this CD as a \\"must have\\" for Stevie Wonder fans; and people who enjoy music from this time period will love this CD also.<br /><br />Great job, Stevie Wonder! You're a genius!

0374105235|5.0|Breathtaking is a good description. Its amazing how resilient the human soul is, faced with such unspeakable atrocities. I fell in love with this book, I laughed and cried with the author as he recounted his experience as a victim of the civil war in Sierra Leone.  The evil that man is capable of astounds me, but out of this pain and struggle emerges an inspirational voice and a young man full of wisdom, courage and a passion to change the world for the better. Great book!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I first bits and pieces of this show on public television and decided to buy the dvd, it is absolutely a very fine performance by talented ladies celebrating the old world traditional music as well as some modern tunes. <br />The backdrop of the castle adds a very special and nice touch.  The Celtic Women are definately nice to look at as well:^)
B00000612P|5.0|Great covers of Bob Dylan and Tim Hardin mixed w/ Rod Stewart originals and whiz bang, you have a seminal early 70's rock classic. The musicianship's great- thumping bass, clean guitar and a bit of cheesy keyboards fronting a great gravel-voiced Stewart and on occasion, wailing backups by the estimable Maggie Bell.     This is is the one Rod Stewart disc you must have---what a shame that he turned into a clown.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer has shown us through the years with his music an evolution of character. What's funny is that the persauna that is felt on Continuum is \\"new\\" to the average John Mayer listener, I some how feel it is not new for John himself. Continuum shows us the artist that John has alawys wanted to be. Two singles have been released to date off his official third solo ablum, \\"waiting on the world to change\\", which not so much shows mayer's guitar skills but shows he can use simple chords and still write a catchy tune and make it sound new. Second, \\"gravity\\" (released origanlly with the Trio record almost a year prior), shows the world a new side of mayer(for those only familiar to his radio songs), and the direction of the record. <br /> <br />Blues? John Mayer? Are you serious? This is why you listen and/or buy the record of today's artists. Because the \\"hits\\" or simplified hooks with simple chords that get stuck in your head and then you end up hating the song till you hear it 5 years past its radio air play. <br /> <br />5 but not a 5. Here's the thing. the cd is not a perfect 5. But compared to Mayer's other works and what is out there today it does deserve a 5. And YES I would put it in my top 10 and consider it a classic.  <br /> <br />PROBLEM ALERT. I do have a problem with 1 song...track 11, better know as, In Repair. The record doesn't need it. I feel mayer needed to express something in the song and it means a lot for him i'm sure for it to be there, but it stands out as a song not meant for the CD. Would have fit better on a B-side release. Seems he was nervous about releasing Continuum while making the record and needed to throw a diddy that ressembled Room for Squares. <br /> <br />Here's how I rate an album. I take each individual song and break it down. I listen to(and in this order): <br />1. MIX <br />2. Master <br />3. Vocals & Harmonys <br />4. Chord Progresion <br />5. Bridge(makes or breaks a song) <br />6. Consistency  <br />7. Theme <br />8. Evaluate how the song was put together and suggest if there is anything missing and/or (more often) too much going on. <br /> <br />So.....here is my honest rating: <br /> <br />John Mayer: Continuum <br />1. Waiting on the world to change-***** <br />2. I don't trust myself(with loving you)-***** <br />3. Belief-***** <br />4. Gravity-***** <br />5. Heart of life-***** <br />6. Vultures-***** <br />7. Stop this train-***** <br />8. Slow dancing in a burning-***** <br />9. Bold as love-***** <br />10. Dreaming with a broken heart-**** <br />11. In repair-*** <br />12. I'm gonna find another you-***** <br /> <br />TOTAL: 57/60    SOLID A.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000050X31|4.0|I was pleased with the musical performance, though mainly because this opera is one of my favorites. The sets were not all I thought they could be.  I was disappointed that I could not find a way to find where I had left off in the playing if I needed to interrupt it for any length of time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I read the James Bond novels as a schoolboy and enjoyed them. Not great literature but fun.  The films before this one were quite enjoyable as long as you did not expect them to have any real connection with the books. Sean Connery, an actor I admire, made the first Bond resemble a second-hand car dealer and the films were like Swiss Toni's wet dreams.  The new Bond does away with the silly gadgets and the underground sci-fi theatrical sets and gives us a convincing James Bond in Daniel Craig, in a well made and enjoyable thriller.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie is great. For one, there is no clear cut good or bad guy. To be honest I believe the reason I like this movie is because I identify with some of the thoughts portrayed by John Travolta's character. With terrorism on everyones mind, Swordfish gives an aggressive response to would be terrorists and those who wish to do harm to America and our interests. To often we trade security for sheer diplomacy, this film shows another way. The acting is great, and panning special effects are stunning. Computers, Robbery, Corrupt Politicians, Fast Cars, Explosives, Big Guns, and ... Halle Berry
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I had to play the cd several times before I found the richness of her music. I was struck by Corinne's performance on the Grammy's and bought the cd without listening to one song. At first glance, it seems like another \\"nice\\" cd with slow and melodic songs. After a few plays, you pick up on the diversity in the tunes and realize Corinne has an incredible voice that you can listen to for hours.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I am not a big chick flick fan, so when this movie came out I didn't bother to see it in theaters. What a mistake. Once I did finally view this gem I was blown alway. This all star cast puts together a multifaceted love story, with comedy to spare. Intertwining characters and story lines, plus it's strong overall theme, made this movie almost perfect. This shouldn't have been much of a surprise due to my admiration of other movies written by Richard Curtis. But I digress, this is a great couples movie, which both men and women will enjoy. I guarantee it.
B000N6TX22|5.0|The title of this review is taken from an excellent novel by Phillip Kerr.  The book delves into AI and the possibility of it being the next step in human evolution, but more importantly (as I read it) it addresses the question of why we're here and what our purpose is here on earth. While Kerr acknowledges our evolutionary underpinnings, he more importantly addresses the responsibility we have for our children and the meaning they provide to our lives.  The point of the movie, like the novel, is to delve into the way in which children provide meaning and purpose to our lives, and that if we continue to ignore our children's needs and to abuse and destroy our planet, that they, and thus we will cease to exist.  The movie does an excellent job of making that point in a very matter of fact and non-preachy way.  And while it's set in the future, it didn't have to be.  Much of what the movie portrays, the ethnic cleansing, the refuge camps, the civil strife, currently exists in numerous parts of the world. <br /> <br />It goes without saying that the acting in the movie is excellent. Clive Owen and Michael Caine in particular, give fine performances.  In addition, the way in which the characters and the script portray both the best and worst of humanity is truly astounding <br /> <br />All in all this is a very moving, thought provoking, and deeply meaningful movie, the message of which we ignore at our own peril.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those of us lucky enough to have seen Firefly when it originally aired nothing I say will be a surprise. Firefly was a SciFi Western on the surface, but underneath it was the story of humanity which is truly timeless. It is the story of a rag tag family struggling to make it in a world and or worlds which have gone mad. Fans for firefly browncoats seem to resemble trekkies in their devotion to the show, writers, actors, and its creator Joss Whedon. Fan enthusiasm has since spawned a major motion picture Serenity which picks up where the show left off, and many other extensions like a role playing game, novels, and excellent podcasts like the signal . So if you are looking for something fun prepare to get hooked and join the browncoats. Shiny...
B00005JPFQ|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />16-year-old boys of all ages will have a grand time with \\"Ghost Rider,\\" the upteenth movie adaptation of a beloved Marvel Comics series.  Those of us who don`t fall into that particular demographic, however, will be left scratching our heads wondering what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze is a death-defying motorcycle stuntman with a passion for The Carpenters who, as a youth, sells his soul to the devil in a desperate bid to prevent his father from dying of cancer.  However, as is the Old Boy's wont to do, Satan tricks the hapless youngster by killing the father anyway, leaving Johnny to spend the rest of his life wandering the earth alone and loveless (despite adoration from legions of loyal fans) until he is finally called upon to assume his role as a \\"ghost rider,\\" a bounty hunter for the devil who turns into a flaming skeletal figure that rides around at night collecting all the bad souls and dragging them kicking and screaming to their destiny in the hellish underworld.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" boasts a simplistic good-versus-evil plotline, a stylized, otherworldly look, and a passel of pretty damn cool special effects to keep the fan-boys happy.  It also, however, suffers from uneven acting, faulty logic (why, for instance, would a minion of Satan go around battling evildoers and rescuing the innocent?), and a romantic subplot that is bland and tedious enough to serve as a signal for restroom and concession stand breaks for the diehard action aficionado.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage may be a trifle long in the tooth at this point to be playing a comic book super hero type, and Eva Mendes is little more than a pallid Lois Lane wannabe as his TV reporter girlfriend, Roxanne Simpson.  Luckily, there's some fun to be had at the hands of a couple of old pros who basically walk off with the film:  Peter Fonda (looking more and more like his famous dad in his later years) as a suave, glinty-eyed Mephistopheles; and Sam Elliott as an old, enigmatic cemetery caretaker who may be able to help Johnny in his efforts to eradicate evil and free himself from the curse he`s under (unfortunately, nothing much is done with Elliott's character except to ride him off into the sunset at the end.  A pity).  Their performances, along with the high-flying CG graphics, keep the movie from becoming a total loss.r who may be able to help Johnny in his efforts to eradicate evil and free himself from the curse he`s under (unfortunately, nothing much is done with Elliott's character except to ride him off into the sunset at the end.

B00000K19E|5.0|From time to time, movies come around that will change the landscape. \\"Star Wars\\" did it in the 70's and in my humble view, \\"The Matrix\\" did it in the 90's. Movies, like this raise the bar on writing, special effects, and character development. Once this movie came out, like Star Wars before it, everything after is held to it's standard. Matrix raised the bar, and I believe that 30 years for now, it will still be apart of cinema culture. The Matrix is the Star Wars for my generation.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I am an enourmous Incubus fan, to the extent that words do not explain.  I have heard almost every song they've ever written or covered.  I own all of their albums and have seen them live.  They are a huge inspiration to me and an amazing band.  And I must admit I am dissapointed by Light Grenades.  All I'm going to do is express my point of view.  j    Light Grenades makes me think of machinery, while Morning View makes me think of a beach.  Light Grenades is a good Album, I'm not saying it isn't, but it is NOT as good as Incubus is capable of.  It simply isn't.    Quicksand(8/10):  More of an intro than anything, still very beautiful.  Brandon's vocals are top-notch(as always).    A Kiss To Send Us Off(8.5/10):  I really like the way the song is sung, Ben Kenney's bass playing, and Jose's drumming.  It all flows together, however something isn't as strong...  It's Mike.  For some reason, I'm not sure why, his guitar just whispers barely being there at all during the verse, which is a consistent ordeal throughout the entire album actually.    Dig(5/10):  You're damn right I gave it a five out of ten.  \\"But...  But Kenney, why?\\"  The guitar's alright, in fact, the instrumental is actually pretty good.  The lyrics however, and the way the song is sung in general, is very cheesy and not at ALL like the Incubus I know and love.  I mean, \\"...Look me in the eye!\\"  \\"Yes you are my friend!\\"  These lyrics almost sound forced Brandon, you're better than that.    Anna Molly(10/10):  The first single, and not dissapointing in any way.  Awesome instrumental, awesome lyrics, awesome vocals, well put together, well-written.  Just what you would expect from our boys.  Probably the best track off of the album, however, it has gotten way too much radio play to stand the test of time.    Love Hurts(9/10):  A lot of fans hate this one, and I'm not sure. I love it, I love the way the guitar sounds, the drums and bass are a little hushed making it almost poppy(which, yes, is bad) but the lyrics and how they are sung are great.    Light Grenades(8/10):  Awesome song, albeit painfully short.  This feels almost like ACLOTM which is strange seeing as it is the title track for this very different album.  I LOVE the lyrics and how they are sung, the guitar is unique albeit a little akward.  A strong feeling I get is that Mike's guitar doesn't sound \\"full\\" enough.  Whatever that means.    Earth to Bella(8/10):  Great vocals, mediocre guitar.  More of an interlude than anything, I feel that they should have combined parts one and two.    Oil and Water(7/10):  Also a bit too cheesy and poppy for Incubus. Much better than Dig though.    Diamons and Coal(8/10):  You know it almost feels like Dig, Oil and Water and Diamons and Coal are siblings.  This is the best out of three, and I'm not even sure, maybe because palm muting makes everything better.  I do not like how he says \\"I'm not calling you an animal,\\"  in fact, well, I won't get into this, but Brandon's Vocals on this album aren't the best they can be.    Rogues(8.8/10):  Damn decimals.  Nice, full(maybe because they actually used pan setting to put the guitar in stereo this time)guitar, hard hitting lyrics and vocals, lovely drums and Ben's bass humming nicely.    Pendulous Threads(9/10):  The vocals are AMAZING.  The guitar is awesome, the drums are kickass, the bass is probably the best on the album, love it.  Though I can't really make any damn sense of the lyrics.  I'm beginning they didn't spend much time on that this time around.    Earth to Bella part 2(8/10):  Erf ta' Bellaaaa.  I made two songs that are basically the same about you.  Erf ta' Bellaaa.  I should have made it just one song, plx forgav mii lolz.    *JAPANESE VERSION ONLY*Punch Drunk(10/10):  Why the hell am I including this if it's not on the CD?  It's worth including.  Oh yes.  Why didn't Incubus include this and Look Alive if they're so awesome?  Well I'm willing to venture that Incubus strives for a certain \\"feel\\" on each of their albums.  These two songs did not fit in with the rest of the CD, and were therefore thrown onto a... Japanese...  B-side...  Because Japanese people don't care about the feel of CDs?  Hell if I know.  Anyways.  The song is amazing, guitar amazing bass amazing drums amazing vocals amazing lyrics amazing amazing amazing different word other than amazing.    *JAPANESE VERSION ONLY*Look Alive(10/10:  If this were on the American CD, it would be my favorite song on the album.  It still is, if you count it.  I am absolutely in love with this song, it is my favorite in a while.  I love how everything flows together so wonderfully in this song, and Brandon's Vocals have probably never been better.  It's damn near worth paying for that Japanese import.    Overall: 4/5[8/10].  Unlike Morning View and Make Yourself which both get perfect marks in my book, this album is lacking something.  It seems to be stripped down to bare essentials.  **************************************  Edited to add:  After more reading and listening and observing, I'm fairly certain that is BECAUSE Incubus spent so much time on this album (a year instead of 4 months) that it is not as good as the rest.  What the hell do I mean by this?  Well, it's TOO refined...  I'll compare it this way. Morning View is to nature as Light Grenades is to the city.  Nature happens naturally, doesn't take much to happen but is vast (nearly limiteless, if not so) and probably the most beautiful thing there is.  Vast mountains, lakes, wildlife, beautiful flowers, and the stars themselves if you choose to include them.  This is what makes Morning View amazing, it is as vast, open, and beautiful as nature.  Now you have the city.  Of course, the hundreds of buildings well-crafted and built to perfectly precise scale are a marvel in themselves and take on their own beauty when they shine at night, but it's just a city in the end.  The buildings are just a varied bunch of squares, the people in them are great but it getsa bit crowded.  It's a confined space to work in, and nature doesn't flourish here.  So much work making a taller building has left Incubus absent-minded on the simple infinite beauty of nature.  ************************    I'm willing to wager that the next CD will be even better, so if you didn't like it don't give up on Incubus yet.
B000001FKY|5.0|It's probably recognized that every released music album has some type of story behind its production and recording. Most of these are unremarkable and soon forgotten by everyone except the band members and others involved with the album's creation, if the story was ever known by the world in the first place.  Yet there are a few music products that have a well-known history behind their creation, in addition to those particular albums being well-known themselves.  One of these is \\"Hysteria\\" by the British rock band Def Leppard, perhaps the most widely known and appreciated album from this band.  It would be a twist of fate, combined with the response of the band and others to that event, that played a role in the shaping of this album and its characteristics.    The members of Def Leppard included (at the time of this recording) lead vocalist Joe Elliot, drummer Rick Allen, guitarist Steve Clark and Phil Collen, and bass guitarist Rick Savage.  This group had been known as a hard rock band, and their immediately preceding album \\"Pyromania\\" fit the description of hard rock 'n' roll, that album being released in 1983.  As in the expected course of events, their next album (this one) would have probably been released around 1985, yet an unforeseen event would arise to change things.  Rick Allen was involved in a car accident that would severely injure one of his arms to the extent it could not be saved.  Instead of discontinuing his career as a drummer, he decided to resume his playing; his decision was backed up by the rest of the band and the producers.  To accomodate his single arm, he had a special drum machine which allowed him to pound away on the instrument as he previously did.  After a long period of therapy and rehabilitation, Rick was once again thumping and setting the beat for the band's songs.  Def Leppard and the producers made some adjustments to this new situation, toning down on the sound and the tempo from a strictly metal rock to a more pop metal flavor.  The result was a sound that appealed to an even greater scope of listeners at home and abroad.    The consequence was an album released in 1987, harboring twelve songs of varying styles, pace, and themes ranging from softer love songs to high energy tracks, dealing with subjects from relationships to war.  Each of these selections is unique, so that each track is like no other in this collection. Beautiful background vocal harmony sung by the Bankrupt Brothers and melodic lines are common traits of all the songs included in \\"Hysteria\\".  Fabulous guitar work by Steve Clark occupy the interim period between verses in each of these selections.  Seven of these items became hits in the USA, five major ones, and two other less prominent ones.  The highly popular radio hits from this disk are \\"Rocket\\", where a steady moderate beat is dominant; \\"Animal\\", a high-energy, mid-tempo song about passionate love; \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", another passionate love song; the moderately slow, strongly beating \\"Love Bites\\", another song dealing with love, where caution and uncertainty about approaching a relationship is featured.  The title track \\"Hysteria\\" is an extremely popular hit, mid-tempo and soft, with a hint of soft rock blended in with pop and metal.  A somewhat less frequently played hit is the moderately paced \\"Armageddon It\\", where the title translates to \\"I'm a gettin' it\\" and is actually a love song, rather than a tug of war between good and bad, as the title many suggest.  The initial track on this disk, \\"Women\\", was a relatively minor hit, sometimes heard on album-oriented radio stations.  This song had a moderately slow, yet heavy beat throughout.  These seven songs comprise more than half of the album, and contributed to its mass appeal in the USA.    The five remaining songs are no less remarkable.  \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" is moderately fast-paced and makes a good dance song; \\"Run Riot\\" is perhaps the highest energy, hard-driving piece on this whole disk, and comes closest to the definition of heavy metal in pure form.  The mid-tempo \\"Gods Of War\\" contains a strong statement about disliking the duty of serving in battle.  Sounds of war: firing of ammunition, soldiers marching, and a bomb at the end of the track create vivid images of a war-ravaged land.  The second-to-last track \\"Excitable\\" is an explicit illustration of passionate exchange between man and woman, it has a strong thumping beat throughout.  The final track \\"Love And Affection\\" is soft and mid-tempo, similar to the title track.  Its name is descriptive of the subject contained within: another romantic piece combining metal, pop, and soft rock into one.  This last track could have become another major hit if it had been released as a single.    This album turned out to be the high point of Def Leppard's career, in the end.  Never again would this group produce another album of the caliber that \\"Hysteria\\" enjoyed.  Tragedy struck the band again with the untimely death of Steve Clark, and instead of \\"replacing\\" Clark, Def Leppard decided to let their hit making become a thing of the past.  Things could never be the same, and nobody could really take the place of Clark and his style of guitar playing.    Credit is due for making this album possible: Rick Allen deserves admiration for persisting and not giving up his career as a drummer, even in the face of adversity; the rest of the band for agreeing with Rick and supporting his decision continue as their drummer; the record producers for assisting in Def Leppard's efforts to carry on; the doctors and other health care providers for restoring Rick to a functional status; and the people who designed and produced the drum machine that enabled Rick to continue to play in the band.  Everybody here contributed their part in bringing this album to production and actual existence.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" was Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. It was the only one to which the rights were not initially acquired by Cubby Broccoli, hence the previous send-up, starring David Niven, with music by Herb Alpert rather than John Barry. This has now been rectified.<br /><br />Like the more recent Bourne films, derived from books written when there still existed a Soviet Union and a Cold War (for which Judi Dench's wonderful M pines), the plot has to change to accommodate the new realities - and the new political correctness (the CIA's Felix Leiter is, er, darker). Nevertheless, the film is quite remarkably faithful to the book, including the book's (not the film's) last four words (which I won't repeat as it's a part-spoiler) and the book's refreshing absence of absurd gadgetry. Even the torture scene is the same (except for the rope in place of carpet beater (ouch!)).<br /><br />There are echoes of the earlier (in order of filming, not Bond chronology) films - he wins a vintage Aston Martin, although the Aston doesn't appear until \\"Goldfinger\\", and he makes a crack to the Treasury girl along the lines of Money Penny (who doesn't appear). It has added the standard current quota of high-adrenalin action, with the characters manifesting physical abilities, resilience and imperviousness to damage bordering on (and frequently transgressing into) the superhuman. But I wish someone would learn that, when you fire a bullet into a tank of inflammable liquid or pressurized gas, it does NOT burst into an instant fireball!<br /><br />And the new James Bond? Very good, but in a solid, \\"realistic\\" way. Somehow I can't imagine this one being a jolly cricket- and rugger-playing/public school/Oxbridge chap of the type beloved (still) by the British Establishment, the sort of spiffing chaps who ran the British Secret Service in Fleming's day. Moreover, he doesn't deliver the constant stream of glib one-liners (ditto the Bond of the books, of course).<br /><br />And herein perhaps lies the problem. The formula has been changed. The old Bond films, especially the Roger Moore ones, were really tongue-in-cheek, droll comedies masquerading slightly as action films. They thus differentiated themselves in the cinema marketplace. However, with this new style, they are really no different from the rest of the action/thriller pack, such as the Bourne films. Does this successful rejuvenation of a slightly jaded franchise actually represent its eventual demise? We can only wait and see.erein perhaps lies the problem. The formula has been changed.

B000FA57N0|5.0|What a great show! I find it hard to believe that this intelligent, well written show with great actors could be canceled after one season. I bought the complete season on DVD and have savored every episode. Of course, I had to have the movie, Serenity, that is based on the tv show, and the high definition version makes it even better. The image from my Toshiba A2 fed into a 720p Panasonic front projector with a widescreen 96\\" diagonal image is spectacular. I've seen the standard DVD version as well, and the high definition adds punchier colors and, of course, the increased resolution of HD DVD. Highly recommended.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|I so thorougly enjoyed this film. The acting, story line, cinematography were all excellent.It showed the sadness and joy of life that sometiems occur at the same time.   It is told through the eyes of a small boy living in a bombed out European town during the end of WW II.  The child actor is perfect. I love movies; and this film is about a young boy, who also loves moveis.  The film demonstrates how movies can makes us laugh, cry and perhaps distract us from our presnt sorrows. Great story, great film, I highly recommend it.
0783225903|1.0|I just made it through 45 minutes of this \\"classic\\" and had to stop.  This is a frenetic, loud, short-attention-span mess.  The best science fiction (\\"Day the Earth Stood Still\\", \\"Silent Running,\\" \\"The Fly\\") appeals to the inellect.  I'm at 45 minutes and it has failed to engage my thinking on any level.  It's just entertainment, pure and simple, and pretty unpleasant entertainment at that, aimed at a pretty simple-minded audience, I have to say.  The set-ups, like the oh-so-sweet Christmas scene at the beginning are just out of place in this film.  The arrest of Buttle was so ridiculously overdone that I thought I was watching a cartoon version of \\"The Terminator.\\"  The set-ups seem extremely heavy handed, as is the constant reminders of hte \\"Tuttle-Buttle\\" mixup.  The use of the classic songs in this film \\"As Time Goes By\\" and \\"Brazil,\\" is just a travesty.  The goal seems to be to ruin the value of these songs rather than add anything meaningful to the film.  Besides, there are more guns in the first 45 minutes of this film than in most Westerns.  What's that all about?   Was the NRA a major funder for this studio?  You know when a film starts with an explosion that it's going to be pretty bad, unless it's James Bond, which this isn't!
0440238609|5.0|This series is truly a must read. It has everything an epic should have, and more.  You will laugh, cry, and by moved by the characters in this story. Adults can easily appreciate this tale, but it must be read objectively.  There are many \\"big\\" issues in this book that some people could be easily offended by and maybe that's why I like it so much.  This series is thought provoking, as is any good literature.  Read it.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the songs when I was a kid.  What memories they bring back!
B000NA28I4|2.0|If you have read the book avoid the movie! They took a unique, rich and enchanting story and made it very commonplace. This movie did not have to be called Eragon as it very loosely resembles the beautifully written story that goes with that name. Some of the best aspects of the book were not just removed they were reversed. The proud, independent and STRONG villagers of Carvahall were turned into dirty, cringing peasants not deserving a moments notice. Galbatorix, who in the book is only mentioned in conversations, makes frequent appearances in the movie for no other reason than to direct Durza to \\"go get them, NOW.\\" Just a pointless waste of time when good parts of the book were slashed to make it fit to movie length. Arya is no longer a strong, vibrant character. Angela the healer is a pretty young woman instead of an old woman. Solembum the werecat does not exist. Murtagh is barely a character in the movie. The relationship between Brom and Eragon is not developed well so that you don't even care when Brom dies. Farthen Dur does not exist, the Varden live outdoors in the mountains. So, so much chopped and changed. Some of the special effects are pretty good but others are disappointing. The dragon in 1996's Dragonheart was nearly as well rendered. BTW ...Urgals? Look more like Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Christopher Paolini. I really wish they had done justice to his wonderful book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has a few thousand reviews so I'm not sure it needs another one, but...  I bought this on a whim after reading so many positive comments on amazon.  I kept thinking, \\"How could so many people be so sad about the cancellation of a TV show?\\" Well, now that I've watched the series, I understand.  This show is funny, smart, engaging - I'd watch alot more TV if there were more shows like this.  <br /> <br />If you think you might be the slightest bit interested in this series, just get it!  I can't imagine anyone being dissapointed (you'd have to be just plain stupid).  The special effects are great for a TV show and the characters are memorable. <br /> <br />More compliments are coming to mind but I don't have time to write a long review.  Save some time of your own - Stop reading the reviews and buy the Firefly series! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001HAISG|5.0|My daughter and I just loved this when we saw it on cable. It was on our wish list for a long time and finally got it for her birthday. Mommy is just as excited about it as she is! Very well done version of the Peter Pan story. Jason Isaacs is terrific in dual role of the Father and Captain Hook.<br /><br />Beautiful visuals. Very nice all round.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|To call The Blackening just a metal album is a disservice.  After the fantastic work that was Through the Ashes of Empires, Machine Head returns and follows it up with quite possibly their best effort yet.  The Blackening picks up where Ashes left off and shows the band coming out the gate full throttle and ready to destroy.  The heaviness of this album is a new standard for the band (and metal all over as far as I'm concerned) but the musicality of the album is what sets it apart from prior releases, even Ashes.  The opening track, \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent,\\" is a ten minute opus that starts somber and quiet, launches into full scale dual guitar brutality, winds through a trade off guitar solo section and comes back with the ultimate fist pumping bridge I've heard since \\"Creeping Death.\\"  \\"Beautiful Mourning\\" is a bit shorter, but thrashes damn well and keeps the feel of the album going.  \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" is probably the most angry song on the album and is a tribute to Mr. Dimebag Darrell as well as a shot at a writer who trashed Dime and the metal community as a whole after his death.  The song is a visceral tour de force of crushing riffs and an excellent harmonized bridge that leads into a beautiful trade off guitar solo between Phil Demmel and Robb Flynn.  The harmonized lines are beautiful and the solo might be one of the best on the albums.   <br /> <br />The rest of the album follows suit.  \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" is a little more balladesque at first but sweeps into a grinding bridge and solo.  \\"Slanderous\\" is heavy and thrashes with the best of them.  The last three tracks are an amazing half hour of music unto themselves.  \\"Halo\\" is almost ballad like, and and the guitar melodies during the chorus are spectacular.  The bridge vaults the song into an amazing instrumental section, with a few twists and turns and more sweet lead work.  \\"Wolves\\" is thrash at its finest and delivers 9 minutes of it and it crushes.  \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is the closer and it could not be more fitting.  It starts slow and somber, moves into a sludge-riff verse with a very melodic chorus and picks up tempo halfway through and tears down the last half.  The music here is Machine Head at their best: excellent riffs, excellent vocal and instrumental harmonies, wonderful leadwork (the solo here might be the best on the album.  I like it even more than the one in \\"Asthetics of Hate\\") and great pacing and well placed tempo changes to keep the song interesting.  The feel of the song is almost cataclysmic lyrically and musically, but it's beautifully done.   <br /> <br />The performances are spot on by all the band members.  The dual guitar crunch of Flynn/Demmel is probably the heaviest tone on the market right now (never have 5150s sounded so damn good), and the lead tones are awesome - full, singing, sustaining and just plain powerful.  Dave McClain's drumwork is in top form and is as pulsating and powerful as ever.  And Adam Duce's bass takes melody and some points and has returned to a more aggressive tone, almost like that on \\"The More Things Change\\" (which has the best bass tone Machine Head has ever had).  While not overplaying, his own melodies and harmonies work so well on this album, even more so than previous efforts.  Plus he does some excellent backup vocal work as well.  And Robb's vocals are phenomenal.  His roar is in top form but his singing has gotten better.  Everything fits and it fits well. <br /> <br />Machine Head's goal was to push themselves further than they've ever gone with an album.  With this record, they've accomplished just that.  It may be the finest album of their career and it may be one of the most powerful metal albums since \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" and even \\"Master of Puppets\\" before it.  This album thrashes, but it does so in a way that can only be described as epic.  This is metal.  Uncompromising, aggressive and powerful, this is metal at its finest.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I remember reading in some interview that Mustaine said: \\"This is the best work I've done so far in my career\\", do we need more than that to know this album will change metal as we know it?<br /><br />All tracks I've heard so far sound very promising specially Sleepwalker!!<br /><br />May 15, 07 is D-Day!

B000ADWDF2|5.0|'Brødre'('Brothers') is a remarkable film from Denmark written by Anders Thomas Jensen and Susanne Bier who also directs this microscopic examination of the intricacies of family bonding, the significance of the blood ties between brothers, and the effects of one of the brutal realities of war on every individual member of a family. It is a tense drama made palpable by some phenomenal acting and direction.<br /><br />Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) are polar opposites as brothers: Michael is his father's dream, a man who is committed to his family, his beautiful  and devoted wife Sarah (Connie Nielsen) with whom he has two daughters, while Jannik is a carefree drifter who drinks too much and refuses to have the stable life his parents expect of him.  Michael is off to war in Afghanistan and is in a tragic helicopter accident and reported as dead. When Sarah is informed her world crumbles, as does the mental state of her father-in-law.  Jannik hears the news while drunk but slowly awakens to the awful reality that his brother is gone and his sister-in-law and nieces need the support he has never been able to muster.<br /><br />In Afghanistan we discover that Sarah's inclination that Michael is not really dead is true: Michael has been captured by the Taliban and the experience as a prisoner changes him indelibly, breaking his shell of perfection and he becomes vulnerable and fragile.  When Michael returns home to the surprise of everyone the dynamics that have reversed between the family and Jannik and the force that bonds Michael and Jannik is challenged and we are left to examine the fallout.<br /><br />The script in Danish is supplemented with excellent subtitles in English, but one wonders if the words are even necessary - so fine is the acting of every actor involved.  Connie Nielson is a major force in cinema today, a brilliant actor whose spectrum of dynamics appears endless.  Both Thomsen and Kaas are equally fine in their difficult roles.  This is a superlative work, a psychological drama that strikes chords of familiarity on many levels.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, March 07ult roles.

B000LPS3B2|4.0|Shutter would probably rate as one of the better Asian ghost flicks to come out over the last couple of years. As I stated in another review for the movie The Red Shoes this style of movie is getting too clich&eacute;d. After taking a break for a few months I have recently started watching the Asian ghost movies again.<br /><br />The only major downfall for Shutter is that several movies that came out after it were released in the States first so that takes away some of the impact. Had I seen Shutter during its initial release I'm sure I would have liked it more. Now that's not to say I didn't enjoy Shutter because I very much did. But like I said several movies that came out after Shutter just happened to be released here first.<br /><br />Despite the clich&eacute;s Shutter, proves Asian filmmakers are still capable of making a movie like this and can make it enjoyable. Unlike some other ghost movies it takes a while before the haunting begins. Normally a few things will start to happen and it's a foreshadowing of things to come.<br /><br />But in Shutter it starts to happen rather early and stays through the movie, which is what helped keep the movie moving along. Let's be honest here though the long haired Asian girl doesn't exactly strike the fear it once did from the viewer. We have seen it done so many times by now it has lost its impact a bit.<br /><br />But directors Banjong Pisanthanakun & Parkpoom Wongpoom are still able to make the best of the scenes and they are able to make several scenes a lot creepier than they really should be. While I can't say I was scared, but there were several very suspenseful and tense moments, which for the majority have been lacking in recent movies like this.<br /><br />Of all the Asian ghost flicks I have seen as of recent none were badly made they just suffered from too many clich&eacute;s, but this movie is able to make the best of them. The mystery angle was rather solid, but at the same time I felt more time was needed and would have made the movie even stronger. While the script wasn't bad, Shutter can sometimes be a bit slow when there is no ghostly haunting.<br /><br />The characters were ok; while they weren't boring they weren't strong enough to carry the movie when there was no ghost. But with that said there is a very interesting twist with the character Tun. He's not as innocent as most characters are in these movies and that was an excellent change of pace. Like I said there are flaws; again we have seen this style of movie played out, while the characters were good they just weren't interesting enough to carry the movie for too long.<br /><br />Besides being clich&eacute;d the only problem I have with Shutter is that some of the scenes just fall a bit flat. To me it just seemed the characters were often repeating themselves in scenes just with different words. That's not to say Shutter wasn't well-written; it does have a solid script for the most part.<br /><br />But there are also several things about Shutter that are excellent. The scene when the ghost is on the side of the car was a creepy scene and provided a great jolt and when the ghost chases Tun around late in the movie was one of the creepiest scenes I have seen in an Asian ghost flick in quite sometime. For those new to this style of movie I would say Shutter should be one of the first films you see so it doesn't lose the impact the scenes have. For those who are well schooled on these movies, Shutter won't offer you anything you haven't seen before.<br /><br />But with that said it's by far one of the better Asian ghost movies and despite the clich&eacute; it can and probably will keep you entertained. As I stated earlier in the review several movies that were made after Shutter just happened to be released in here in the States first, which is a shame because it does hurt the movie a little bit.<br /><br />In closing despite the clich&eacute;s and some flaws, Shutter was an excellent movie and shows there isstill some life left in this sub-genre.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|I am distraught to have to review with 2 stars the first latin american movie to be nominated for best movie.  Unfortunately, the only imaginative and clever part in the movie is Santaolalla's Guitar, who has illuminated other sadly lame movies, as Brokeback Mountain.  Proudly, latin, deserving oscar Winner, Santaolalla, creates the illusion of rich meaning for this children puzzle, where there is not.<br />The director uses the same formula he uses in all his movies ( a bad adaptation of tarantino's).  Creating simple histories, then order them in a linear structure, unite them by a very thin thread and them break them apart.  Then he leaves the audience a abysmal chasm between stories united by a thin line, for them to fill by their eager and more creative imagination with meaning and ultimately link them together, and give it sense.  Assuming this audience believes he's a master that has said little, but hints to a well of wisdom, not said, but in front of you.<br />Just check the stretch of meaning he pulls to join the history of the rifle, which is really about the americans and the daughter of the japanese owner of the rifle that once traveled east (no explanation there) and gives the rifle as a gift . I agree this is Brad Pitt's start as a real actor.  I love his movies, but not his acting, until this movie in which he stops showing how \\"self conscious\\" he is about his looks, looking 40, at last.[[ASIN:B0009HLSVO Sesame Street Wooden Alpha Blocks]]

B00000DCHI|1.0|I don't often get \\"greatest hits\\" collections, preferring instead to buy original albums, but in this case I did, because there are a handful of Billy Joel songs I wanted in my collection, but I didn't want to invest enough to purchase all of his albums. Unfortunately, they don't tell you that what you get here, at least in some instances, are the \\"single\\" versions of these songs, not the full-length versions from the original albums. Case in point: One of my favorite Billy Joel songs is \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" but the version on this set cuts an entire verse. I haven't done comparisons on all of the other songs, but if they'd pull that on this song, they probably did so on others as well. It's incomprehensible to me; if someone wants Billy Joel songs, the odds are that they want the complete songs, not truncated re-edits.

B00004TX5F|2.0|Visually opulent, and with a stunning soundtrack, this film could have been so much better if it didn't take completely unnecessary--and foolish--liberties with the story of the real Farinelli. Unfortunately, much of the plot is just plain silly. Whether or not a castrato would have been capable of sexual relations (and it is believed that they were), it is absurd how the film proposes that Farinelli would have sex with a woman, but then had to turn her over to his uncastrated brother to finish her off, as it were. I doubt that a man's ability to ejaculate has much to do with a woman's sexual satisfaction. And the portrayal of the composer George Frideric Handel is just plain ridiculous. When I saw this film in a theater with three friends, the scene where Handel hears Farinelli sing and nearly has a heart attack, with his wig falling off, prompted all four of us to laugh out loud. (In reality, Handel didn't have as high an opinion of Farinelli's singing as some, and chose not to hire him for his own opera troupe.) The film also depicts Farinelli plotting to sing Handel's music by having a maid steal a manuscript from Handel's apartment. The result is Farinelli singing \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" from the opera Rinaldo--which makes no sense at all, since that aria was written for a woman soprano, not an alto castrato, and Farinelli didn't perform travesty roles. Besides, by the time of the incident portrayed, the score of Rinaldo had been published and Farinelli could have simply purchased a copy. The main attraction of this film is the soundtrack. We really have no idea what the castrati sounded like (yes, I know there is a recording of \\"the last castrato\\" made in 1902, but it's a terribly weak representation of what the great ones must have sounded like), so for the film they concocted a unique voice by digitally combining the sounds of a woman soprano and a male falsettist. The result is dazzling; my recommendation is to buy the soundtrack. The best elements of the film are the beautiful costumes and camera work. The staging of  opera scenes is beautiful enough that you wish they had included complete excerpts, instead of frustratingly brief teases; at least the musical selections are complete on the soundtrack CD.
0743454537|4.0|The best sentence in this book: \\"Her hair is longer now, and fine lines bracket her mouth, parentheses around a lifetime of words I was not around to hear.\\"  Following on from the tradition of Niffenegger where a husband and wife team narrate in the first person, the main characters in this book all narrate in the first person.  There are seven protagonists, seven vantages though it's pretty clear they did not write down their stuff at a later date, more a first person narrative for each. <br /> <br />Picoult is a plot driven author rather than an events driven author.  Nouns gather up and generate the structure of her objectives and their disjunctions rather than forming the elements of an observational description - or perhaps to be fair, the heart of the book is the plot with lots of observation to bring it to life. <br /> <br />There are quite a few cliffhangers. <br /> <br />I have to admit, this would not have been my choice of book - it's about family and love.  Would you donate one of your organs to your brother or sister?  I think this book will definitely help resolve the issue. <br /> <br />Replete with medical jargon about leukemia, two sisters are joined - donor and recipient - eventually, one of them may have to die because she is dependent on her sister for survival. <br /> <br />It involves a family of a firefighter father, a determined mother, a wayward brother, the sisters, hospitals, a lawyer and his ex girlfriend.  There is a lawsuite and the drama that this involves. <br /> <br />The book is certainly interesting and Picoult is a master story teller.  I found it a little too commercial and the characters were too upright, too nice to believe - as is the story.  Real life is smoothed over a little bit though its injustices are poignantly revealed - if sweetened. <br /> <br />A memorable start and close with a meandering, potboiler centre.  Some will enjoy reading this and the choices it forces you to confront.  Inspirational and educational.

I fully intend on reading through it a second time.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|To get off the bat, I've loved Muse for a while, I own all their albums, and I quite frankly am quite annoyed at how one of their worst songs in a while, Starlight, while still a good song, is the song they're getting huge amounts of fake fans for.  It's annoying, to say the least.  Incredibly, considering the pure genious of Origin of Symmetry.  This prog at it's loudest, but also with some great vocals, incredible lyrics, and long songs. <br /> <br />Starting with the six minute long New Born, all the way to Muse TV, this album is almost startlingly loud, with a couple of piano exceptions, but it sure as hell is powerful.  Matthew Bellamy's wonderful range and inflection add much power to lyrics about the apocalypse, among other things.  And while the Radiohead comparisons will never go away, they sure do a hell of a job with developing their own jazz-influenced identity and sonic-experimentation.  I really enjoy long songs, and with three over six minuters on this album, it definetly is in Prog territory. <br /> <br />And on that note, who let a former punk write the editorial for this album?  Really, are pretense and prog cardinal sins?  I suppose using more than two chords for one song is, but that's another manner entirely. <br /> <br />To finish, this is a great modern prog album.  They may have developed their traits as they grew as a band, but this was just so much of a masterpiece they recreate it.  Thankfully, they didn't try.

B000002MUW|4.0|Even though this is my least favorite cd from Madge, I do think there are some great r&b songs even though I prefer her pop songs instead. Songs I do appreciate are: Survival, Secret, Human Nature, Forbidden Love, Bedtime Story and Take A Bow. I heard Madge was frustrated when she worked on this album back in 1994. She complained there were too many producers and it caused this album to get second-guessed as her least creative work. Human Nature is her strongest and fearless track of all-time, I love how frank and guiltless she sounds on that track. I recommend Ray of Light and American Life, these are stronger albums but Bedtime Stories was good but not great, but I love ya Madge, so keep on doing your thang!
B00000JGHS|2.0|...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for Worst Picture of the Decade?<br /><br />I think, \\"Striptease\\" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness. The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club \\"Eager Beaver\\" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who \\"just loves naked women. It's a character flaw\\" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in \\"Eager Beaver\\" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers - after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in \\"Striptease\\" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material.<br /><br />Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million - one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.<br /><br />2.5/5the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material.  <br /> <br />Who had the best laugh?

B0002IQEHI|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, \\"North by Northwest\\" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor. The film is based on a case of mistaken identity that in a course of a few days makes a likable (even if slightly arrogant) Manhattan ad-man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning. Next, he finds himself in the UN building talking to a man who drops dead in the middle of the conversation in front of hundreds of people. The worst part - the man is murdered and Thornhill has the murder weapon, the knife in his hand. Both, the police and the spies are on his trail and his only hope is to escape NYC by train where a very sexy blonde named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) is ready to help him. Their encounter leads to one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed without any sexual act involved.<br /><br />The film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one- liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop-duster and the climatic chase on Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes - a chase on the face of a president and the attempt to wake up the Peru Ambassador during the assembly in UN who turned to be dead, had his dreams fulfilled with \\"North by Northwest\\" which he suggested should be called \\"The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose\\". Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.<br />

But after a short time, I found this band to be too overly simplistic to be interesting. <br /> <br />The opening number, \\"Got this thing on the move\\" shows Farner's total ineptitude at putting a song together.  The song goes from an uptempo to a slow break and Farner's lack of imaginative, improvisational \\"technique\\" rears its ugly head in his solos.  From here on in, its downhill.  What is funky to some is plodding, heavy-handed, and downright dull.  Few bands come off less talented than Grand Funk.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Blood Diamond was a film that I didn't really want to see but I wanted to see. I didn't want to see it because the things I was told about it didn't really make me too happy. Blood diamonds or conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance the conflicts. I remember as a child my mom would tell me that there're places in Africa where you could walk down the roads and find diamonds and jewels in the ground. Of course I didn't totally believe her then cause I was like 6 but after seeing this you come to see how valuable and beautiful Africa really is.<br /><br />The film is set in 1999 in the Sierra Leone civil war the country is at a constant struggle with fights between government soldiers and rebel forces. The rebels named RUF are pretty much past crazy, invading villages, cutting off innocent peoples hands so they're unable to vote and taking strong men to mine and young children to mold into little soldiers. Everything starts with Solomon Vandy, a good man with a good family and his son is a good student. One day while walking home with his son after catching some fish a few trucks playing music come speeding behind them. There are armed men in the truck and Vandy immediately knows trouble is coming. He runs to his village in a great panic to get the rest of his family out but the men get there first and are already just killing whoever. Vandy gets his family out but he gets caught and is sent to work the mines in search of diamonds.<br /><br />While working the mines Vandy finds one of the largest and rarest diamonds ever. Somehow he sneaks off to hide the diamond and lucky for him government troops attack just as a RUF soldier sees what he's doing. Unfortunately Vandy gets caught and is arrested along with the injured soldier. While in prison the soldier shouts what he saw Vandy do and says he will give money to anyone who gets the truth out of him. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) trades weapons for diamonds and overhears the talk between Solomon and the soldier. Archer is quick to help Solomon get out and then starts harassing him to get the diamond. A number of events occur that just making everything worse, the absolute worse being Solomon's son getting kidnapped but RUF and made a little soldier. Now Vandy must get his child back and goes on a hard journey to get the diamond and his child.<br /><br />First of all things I can't believe Djimon Hounsou didn't win Best Supporting Actor for this film. Seeing him in the previews going crazy to find his son was even getting to me. I don't think I could explain how powerful his performance was in this film. It was so realistic and perfected that you had to feel his pain. The scene at the end with when he tries to bring his brainwashed sons mind back was amazing. I saw Little Miss Sunshine and not to take anything from Alan Arkin but that was nothing compared to Hounsou in this film, Hounsou should've been the one that walked out. I too have never really been a Leo fan but you can't deny that he has a great talent. He plays Danny Archer on point and never lets the character go.

B0000AUHPG|4.0|\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is one of the best films in the Western genre and also the most fun to watch due to its look and style. The movie is directed by Sergio Leone. I'm familiar with Leone's work, but have never seen any of his films. \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" bares the unmistakable signature of a genius though and I look forward to watching many more Leone films in the future. The film has one of the greatest opening scenes I've ever seen; lasting 13 minutes, the film opens at a train station where three men anxiously await the arrival of the train. They're waiting for someone. After Leone slowly builds the tension (and I don't know about a director that could do it better), the train arrives and a man (Charles Bronson) gets off of it, playing a harmonica. He's supposed to be meeting with a man named Frank, but we learn that Frank is attending to some other business. Soon, the three men there to meet the man are dead; And because of Frank (Henry Fonda, in one of his strongest performances), a family of 4 is dead. Then the young lady set to marry the father of the family, who is actually already married to him, arrives and is shocked to find everyone dead. The police think they know who did it already and are quick to point the finger at Cheyenne (Jason Robards), after all...He left his \\"signature\\" there. I don't want to say much more about the plot (and there is much more; The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes)...When you look at all the westerns in the history of cinema (mind you, I haven't seen another Leone film) and say which one you think is \\"the most well-made,\\" this film has to pop up. <br />It's not the most entertaining western film (there are long stretches with no dialogue), but it is certainly one of the most suspenseful, colorful (not just in the literal sense), and most compelling of the genre. The performances, especially those of Fonda, Robards, and Bronson are superb. It's also clear while watching the movie how influential it has been on other filmmakers. You can even see more than echoes of this film in \\"Kill Bill Vo.2.\\" Explaining just how unique a film like this is in writing is difficult, but I recommend that any true fan of cinema see this movie. Any true fan of western movies has probably already seen this movie, but I mean a true LOVER of cinema needs to see this. It's one of the few western movies I can think of off the top of my head that can deservedly be labeled a masterpiece. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+

B000LAZDQA|3.0|The reviews for this film are almost as entertaining to read and ingest as the movie itself. That may or not be a good thing. For example, here on Amazon, Shortbus is averaging 4½ stars as of this writing. On pro.imdb, it has a respectable 7.2/10 score from viewers. On Metacritic.com, the average critic rating is 64 (65 on RottenTomatoes.com), while the average user rating is 8.7/10. A conspicuous variance. <br /> <br />I rented the movie for two reasons: 1) I find that [[ASIN:B00005QW5X Hedwig and the Angry Inch]] is not only a brilliant film, but it is also one of my top-10 favorites \\"of all time\\" and have been waiting for John Cameron Mitchell to come out with something new for a while, and 2) to be embarrassingly honest, to satisfy a carnal curiosity. <br /> <br />Shortbus is a film focused on relationships and inner demons, and sex seems to have come along for the ride. In the opening scenes, we are witness to the most vivid sex I've ever seen on film that hasn't been classified as pornography, and these scenes were far \\"harder\\" than any soft core porn I've ever seen and in some cases better than the hard stuff, undoubtedly because this had the distinct stamp of feeling real. There's a young man auto-fellating (James, played by Paul Dawson), a \\"trust fund Muppet\\" and a Mistress (Justin Bond playing himself and Lindsay Beamish as Severin), and a heterosexual couple (Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia and Raphael Barker as Rob). Sofia and Rob have the most straightforward sex - pun intended? - as the first two scenes are more exploratory in theme and content. All end in shattering climaxes; indeed, James cries when he is finished; Justin hits the wall, so to speak, while Severin looks on, stunned; and Sofia finds her way to a rather convulsive end. <br /> <br />Frankly, it was all rather steamy, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater, if only to look around and watch people squirm in their seats. <br /> <br />And then we get to the meat of the matter. James's and his boyfriend Jamie see a sex therapist - Sofia - who prefers to be called a couples counselor. Their intention is to open up the relationship. As they talk, it's obvious to the viewer, and to Sofia, that Jamie has no life outside of James, and that the two appear to have very different agendas. She sends Jamie out of the room to talk to James alone, and after that, talks to Jamie alone. When you compare the Jamie that spoke to Sofia in her office to the Jamie throughout the rest of the film, you see a very different character. The Jamie in Sofia's office is, frankly, an idiot and immensely unlikable. Even Sofia slaps him. The Jamie throughout the rest of the book may be hyper-dependent on James, but he's warm, compassionate, and likeable. <br /> <br />We learn that Sofia's slap was not only a reaction to Jamie's personality, but also because she is \\"pre-orgasmic\\", meaning that she's never had an orgasm. They suggest that she go to a place called Shortbus to help find relief to this. <br /> <br />Shortbus (the place, not the film) is a world within a world, with the requisite transvestite caretaker and rooms upon rooms of deviance and compulsion. There is, of course, the large room where everyone is naked and having sex, and other rooms where people hang out with no clear purpose (this is a weakness in its structure). When Sofia enters, she bumps into James and Jamie, who are there to \\"work at\\" opening up the relationship. <br /> <br />Severin is there too, and Sofia meets her as she flees the other rooms - too many men. They develop a friendship, and decide to help each other: Sofia will help Severin try to open herself up to having a more meaningful relationship than what she has with her johns, and Severin will try to help Sofia reach orgasm. It's not at all clear what qualifies Severin to help with this, and it's not even particularly clear why Sofia contacted Severin outside of Shortbus to be friends. <br /> <br />James and Jamie find their third: Ceth (pronounced Seth), and we're treated to yet more sex. In an hysterical but somewhat uncomfortable moment, Jamie sings the Star Spangled Banner while, um, using Ceth's behind as a megaphone. Stranger yet, Ceth says that it wasn't the first time that's happened. The three do look very comfortable together. <br /> <br />With all the pieces in place, the story begins to dramatize, and moves from the light hearted sexy romp into a darker place of inner demons. It's far less successful when the lights go out - and I mean this both figuratively and literally, as the story is set against a backdrop of increasing brownouts that eventually lead to a blackout. <br /> <br />Every character is beset with demons, but none more so than James is. And somehow, in the end, they all achieve resolution. What I'm uncomfortable with is *how* they reached resolution, because what was presented didn't make an ounce of sense to me. It appears that sex opened doors for everyone to delve deeper inside, but here's a huge problem: with the singular exception of James, we have no idea what anyone's inner demons are. If we don't know what they are, how can we accept any form of resolution for them? And while we do learn of James's demons, his epiphany (or what he did to reach that epiphany) made no sense at all and was utterly unbelievable. <br /> <br />The movie was loosely scripted, and it grew in the telling with the actors ad-libbed input. I might have guessed that fact if the film didn't tell us, because (as I illustrated with Jamie above) characters sometimes went against what I felt their core-values were, at least as they were established in the beginning segments of the film. It's a great concept, but without continuity, believability suffers. <br /> <br />I'm on the fence with this. I'm tempted to give it two stars for a story that meandered and fell apart at the end, but they have to get credit for filming so much sex while none of it was gratuitous. At no time did the sexual situations ever seem overdoneor out of place. That's one heck of an accomplishment, given how much flesh was shown. And there was a LOT of flesh. Men were erect and they climaxed - and we saw the result of their climax. We saw Sofia madly at work trying to give herself the big O, and were given, more than once, a very clear picture of her \\"sex\\". (I don't know how else to say it and escape Amazon's censors. <br /> <br />3 stars for their accomplishment... <br />
B00005JPLU|5.0|In 480 B.C., 300 Spartan soldiers led by Kin Leonidas (Butler) defended Sparta from a much larger Persian force led by King Xerxes (Santoro).  The story is mostly clouded in legend, and although the Spartans did not win the battle, they dealt Xerxes and his army a blow that would eventually be their downfall.  This was the Battle of Thermopylae.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is like nothing before it.  If you thought \\"Sin City\\" has neat to look at and a great example of comics come to life, \\"300\\" will blow you away.  This movie has style.  It is beautiful to look at and is worth seeing for the visuals alone.  The cast of relative unknowns does a good job in bringing life to the characters.  None are well known enough to overshadow the story, and that is a plus.  \\"300\\" is a non-stop action movie that I highly recommend.  And even if it is not grounded completely in reality, I think the Spartans would still be proud of it.
B000068FUS|1.0|After reading the other reviews of this two disk set, I thougt I'd add this to my collection. What a huge mistake. To say that these guys sound anything like Lynyrd Skynyrd or any other quality Southern Rock Band of the 70's era would be a total put-down of all the true musicians of that era. When I received this set in the mail, I first pulled out the liner notes and lyrics and read the whole \\"book\\". I liked the lyrics and the theme of most of the songs. Then I put the disks in and listened to this mess. I have never been more disappointed in my life. The longer I listened the more angry I became. Why? These guys suck. They are bad musicians, the production is bad, as far as the general sound quality, it is a muddy mess. If you are looking for good musicians with good tone that understand how to weave three guitars into well written, intricate songs with the sweet twang of southern rock guitars, look elsewhere. These hackers missed the mark by a long shot. They play out of tune, sing out of key and the production is bad. I can't believe I was suckered into actually paying for this garbage.

B00005JPLU|3.0|Historical inaccuracies aside, this was simply a bad adaptation of the battle of Thermopylae in every sense. In addition to a poorly conceived plot, lifeless acting, and absurd distortions, the film is so far removed from the realm of human reality that it defeats its attempts at presenting historical events or any form of realism.  <br /> <br />The acting in the film is minimal to non-existent where dialogue is expressed through nothing more than primitive grunts and groans in a vain attempt at emphasizing the bravery of the Spartan protagonists. This is accentuated by the absurd portrayal of the Spartans as going to war bare-chested with only 6' spears. This is about as stimulating as watching the GIs in 'Saving Private Ryan' assaulting the beaches with only bayonettes and camouflage underwear. Realistically, I don't think the Spartans would have fared very well against any army with no breastplates and only 6' spears. For some strange reason, the creators of the film also chose to present the Persians as being either African or as Orcs straight out of 'Lord of the Rings' when in fact the Persians were an Indo-European peoples who were relatively tall and fair-skinned originally from areas around the Caspian Sea. For a while, watching the Immortals in their absurd Skeletor masks made me think I was watching a re-release of the kids' film 'He-Man' and the background scenery seemed more like the hell in \\"Spawn\\" than anything else. Although the CGIs were ok, the fighting sequences were as absurd as those of 'Troy' where our brave Spartan heroes break out of their phallanx formations to do flying roundhouse kicks to amuse their audience. Finally, the excessive machismo in the film made me wonder more about the artists' masculinity complex and their need to overcompensate in that department than anything else.  <br /> <br />To juxtapose this absurd rendition to something closer to home, this film is just as idiotic as if the artists were to make their own version of the Alamo where Lt-Colonel Travis and his brave Texans made their final stand shirtless with only Bowie knives against 100,000 blood-thirsty caricatures of Mexican soldiers looking like Orcs from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and wearing 'Day of the Dead' masks. Caricatures of evil Mexicans enthralling themselves with tequila while assaulting the mission with vicious snarling bulls as if they were at a corida on the Cinco de Mayo. As absurd as if General Santana were depicted as a 10' dark-skinned caricature with an evil guttural voice encouraging his drunken minions to fight the brave Travis and his bare-chested Texans to the last.  <br /> <br />This was such a poorly conceived film that was so detached from any semblance to human reality that it seemed to be a rather pointless effort at historical adaptation: they might as well have made it a science fiction or pure fantasy film loosely based on the events with no reference to Ancient Greece as it really had no semblance to history or human reality in the first place. <br />

In a rich and vibrant fantasy world, George R. R. Martin, creates a complex and intricate story of war, intrigue, and betrayal that is similar to the historical War of the Roses, but only much grander, and vastly more compelling.<br /><br />The story has something for everyone, mystery, romance, and action, but even more it creates a reality that is believable, with characters that seem real to live, some you like, some you loath, but all wonderfully interesting!<br /><br />There is some violence, yet is no more than many comparable works, less than \\"The Return of the King,\\" by JRRT, and it certainly fits into a medieval fantasy war story.<br /><br />The sexual content touches on adult themes, but it is not anywhere as graphic as most aimed at an adult audience, anyone over the age of 16 should be able to handle this book. In fact the most disturbing sexual content in books 1 thru 4 is a retelling of an event that happens years before the events of the story.<br /><br />p.s. Soon to be an HBO series, they bought the rights, hopefully we will be able to watch these characters before too long!

0071373586|2.0|Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Salem was not the only town that had a flurry of witch trials.  This movie concerns another town where a number of witch families have survived.  Witches have quite a bit of power and it increases exponentially on their eighteenth birthdays.  In this film we meet a group of guys getting close to their increased power.  Using power is addictive and destructive.  While the power seduces one to use it, it also makes them age very rapidly.  Now things are starting to go wrong and the young witches start to wonder about one another. <br /> <br />It seems that someone is using power and using it big.  The young family members take it upon themselves to find out who it is and try and stop it.  Eventually the culprit is found out and final moves are made leading to a final magic battle. <br /> <br />Definitely not what I was expecting based on the trailer.  One of the best effects in the film has a witch in an accident with a truck.  He and his car reform after being smashed by the truck.  This is a great bit of special effects but does not fit with the ability levels as seen later in the film.  Our main characters are under eighteen but look much older.  They hang out in bars.  Their school seems more like a college than a high school although the subject matter seems very basic when shown.  An interesting movie but one with flaws.  Could have been better but it seems the effects took first priority.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|This compilation of the Faces gathers all their great hits and is the best single-disc compilation of theirs that you will find. I think they are a very underrated band, they were very good, they deserved more recognition. Being that I'm a Rod Stewart fan, I think this is just great, even on the songs where he doesn't sing lead. They're a little like the Rolling Stones, but harder-rocking, in my opinion. They were just a good, hard-rock band and definately all about fun. I definately recommend this to anyone who likes Rod Stewart, as well as those that like early hard rock.
0307341542|4.0|This book definitely stands apart for endowing it's protagonist with such a topical and disturbing predilection. Small town girl who has moved to the big city returns to cover the story of a potential killer in the locals midst. What gets revealed is a pretty unsightly portrait of small town America, and a Mother from hell that anyone would've longed to escape from. Flynn manages to shock a few times long the way mostly by her characters outrageous and uninhibited sexuality and violence. Modern day gothic was never so  much fun to read though, and at a slight two hundred and fifty pages, it's wrapped up before you even know it.
B000NA2776|5.0|I pre-ordered this album and was not disappointed. MIKA is not just a pop singer but was also classically trained at the Royal Opera Academy -- his five octave range is fantastic. Some of these songs are rooted in classical, jive, disco -- he even features a spoon orchestra and a Gospel choir. Yet on the surface this album is definitely pop, the lyrics and the dynamics of the music transcend that surface beautifully. My favorite track is \\"Happy Ending,\\" one of the most poignant breakup songs I've ever heard. All of MIKA's lyrics touch on personal subjects and often pain, which he is very good at masking through his catchy, happy music (\\"Grace Kelly\\" is about a record producer rejecting him). I highly recommend this to anyone who loves nuanced music, art rock, alt, pop, disco, opera, and dance music. If you like classical or look for weird, hidden tracks, let the last track run over for 1:00 and you'll get a surprise.
1567315682|5.0|Outstanding, especially the second time read.  5+ stars.  Years ago when I read this amazing book I realized that my personal views on Real Wealth Accumulation were correct.  Stanley and Danko go to great lengths to show that the facade of wealth is just that:  Real wealth is not expensive homes, cars, jewelry, and clothes but what one has in REAL liquid investments.  They point out the insidious nous of debt and how it eats away at real wealth if not managed properly.  Real money management is the key to wealth and becoming a Real millionaire:  Not a faux millionaire with all the accoutrement's but none of the \\"beef\\".  I liked this book so much that I gave it to my son, a budding CPA and entrepreneur, to read,understand and prosper.   <br />A must read along with Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad to truly understand how to build true wealth today.  Sadly, the financial world is filled with charlatans and faux millionaires that are doomed to work forever until death as they DO NOT have a portfolio of real wealth:  Just the \\"Show\\" of wealth.  Point:  I know these 2 books are panned by some as too simplistic in today's complex financial world.  Remember Occam's Razor: \\"The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.\\"  My financial success came from KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid!)  The real key to making money is aggressive and successful DEBT MANAGEMENT.  Simply stated:  Some debt is good, too much debt is very bad and financially debilitating if not worse. <br />Read, enjoy and then go make that Real Wealth!  Live Long and Prosper.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband saw the movie, \\"Serenity\\" on one of the movie channels, and when he found out that it came from a TV series, he had to have this.  I bought it for him for Valentine's Day, and he loves it!  The plots are a little goofy, but it's entertaining (and the lead actor isn't half-bad to look at, either)!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I studied a fair bit about global warming in my university classes, so I really wasn't excited about this film. I figured it would regurgitate much of what I already knew, and ultimately although I believe global warming is currently largely due to human activity, I didn't feel like seeing a movie that was likely just \\"preaching to the choir\\". <br /> <br />But I was very wrong. The film did repeat a fair bit of data I had heard previously, but there was also plenty that was new. And the uplifting message (the idea that this is a problem that we can certainly fix, as long as we get started and can move forward with the necessary steps) makes it a pleasurable watch.

I was a Navy Corpsman attached with the Marines, and it's good to see one as a Main Character for a change.<br />From what I hear from WW-2 Vets that were actually there, this movie tells the story with dignity. Although there are some very graphic war scenes, I highly recommend this movie.
0618680004|5.0|\\"Religion is man's way of explaining the unexplainable.\\" I read this somewhere a long time ago yet it still rings true. Over the millennia, we've always attributed the unknown to a higher power. Little by little, as we've been able to chip away at the unknown - as we've become more aware of the workings of our universe and gained respect of its almost infinite simplicities and complexities - these higher powers (Judaisim, Islam, Christianity, etc.) have lost their luster.  <br /> <br />Lightning is no longer the gods throwing tantrums; earthquakes are no longer punishments from above; diseases are no longer the devil's wrath; the earth is no longer the center of the Universe but simply a small planet in orbit around a relatively minor star in just one of millions of constellations.   <br /> <br />It's inevitable. As we learn more about this universe our minds grow and we attribute less and less to the powers of false, \\"all-knowing\\" gods and their infallible prophets. We've certainly got a lot more to learn but the message is clear: the answers are not in organized religion as we know it.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|For me, Burn My Eyes was the Machine Head album that was the basis for comparison for the rest of their work.  This is now changed, as The Blackening is not only Machine Head's best album, it is one of the best metal albums I have ever heard.      It's amazing that a band can go from making a sub par album like Supercharger to making a great album like Through the Ashes of Empires.  I was glad of their return to form with that CD, but the Blackening is even more than a return to form.  It is a reinvention.  They've taken the great riffing and precice timing of Burn My Eyes and imbued it with a tone that is both brutally angry and chillingly haunting at the same time.  Many of the tracks have slow, melodic passages with amazing bass lines, acoustic guitar parts and a chorus of background vocals and then lead into riffing so brutal you almost forget you are listning to the same song.  Also, as with BME and TtAoE, they intermix modern style riffing with catchy style riffs that are definitely 80s influenced, making them a metal band that anyone can love.  The guitar solos in these songs act as more than just talent showcases for the artists, they flow with the song and with some songs they are the best part.      1) Cleching The Fists of Dissent:   Wow! Possibly my favorite song on the album and maybe my favorite from the band (though Imperium is hard to top).  The intro to this song reminds me of 'Fight Fire with Fire' on Metallica's 'Ride the Litghtning'.  It starts out with a mellow acoustic passage and then bursts into a brutal riff with angry vocals and lyrics to back it.  This is an epic track, clocking in at 9:36 with not a second wasted.  (I particularly like the part at about 6:30 'FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!)    10/10    2) Beautiful Mourning:  No slow acoustic intro here, this song wastes no time as it starts with a nice fast, galloping riff.  I liked this song but didn't think much of it until it got to the chorus, which is actually more than halfway through the song.  The chorus is a great blend of heavy guitars and over the top volcals and lyrics that you can't help but sing along to.  Great track.  8/10    3) Aesthetics Of Hate:  Perhaps the most easily accessable song, I could see this being a single.  It is also the angriest, being a retaliation of an anti Dimebag Daryl article written after his death.  It reminds me of 'Seasons' era Slayer, it has a very 80s vibe to it with catchy riffs and hooks and a good angry vibe all around.  The solo sections are great as is the slow tempo section with the reverbrating vocals (May the hand of God strike them... DOWN......)  Another great one.  8/10    4) Now I Lay Thee Down:  There isn't really a bad song on this album, but I think this may be my least favorite.  It has more of a commercial feel to it than the rest of the tracks and is slower in tempo.  It does have some faster, angrier sections, as everything does on this album, but overall it's not my favorite tune.  6/10    5) Slanderous:  Wow, another crushing track.  I don't know how they managed to come up with so many great riffs for this album.  This song is great all the way through, with the usual blend of modern riffs and old school riffs that make this band great.  There almost seems to be a little bit of an Iron Maiden influence in this song.  Great, great stuff.  8/10    6) Halo:  My favorite track after the first. This one is epic (at 9:03) with so many different sections and also not a wasted minute.  The choruses, the riffs, the solos, everything is great.  9/10    7)Wolves: Another epic, very heavy track.  The riffs didn't catch me as much as with Halo, but this is a brutal song, almost Halo part II.  Another great one, of course.  8/10    8) A Farewell to Arms:  Man, this album doesn't cease to amaze.  This song is another epic and the longest of them all at 10:12.  Like the first track, it starts out with a Metallica style slow tempo into and busts into the amazing, brutal riffing.  A fantastic closer to this masterpiece of an album. 8/10    I can't stress enough how amazing this album is.  Five stars is not enough.  You can tell that the band put all they had into this album, as it bleeds with passion, anger and soul.  It has definitely made it into my top 10 metal albums of all time, up there with Metallica's Ride the Lightning, Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss and Anthrax' Persistance of Time.  Metal is alive and can still be as great as it used to be.  This album is proof.     Machine Head, you have just become legend.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|I bought this Cd after hearing \\"Miss Murder\\" and \\"Love Like Winter\\". I expected more good songs there. But it turns out these are the only 2 really good songs on the album.

1591396190|1.0|Blue Ocean strategy tries to put a new twist on marketing concepts and is overly simplistic.  Nothing wrong with the concepts but it really does not provide the tools to put together a solid strategy and is very narrow.  Based on my analysis the conclusions the authors make from some of the examples are not logical.<br /><br />Some readers of this book are going to invest a great deal of good money using the simplistic analysis this book proposes and be very disappointed.  I have seen one case of this already.<br /><br />There are many better books on marketing and strategy than Blue Ocean Strategy.

0061020710|1.0|Definitely must be a children's book. Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience.  I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing. I don't see how anyone can waste there time on this book...It is really very pathetic and disturbing.

1416914285|5.0|I would actually give this one 4.5 stars if amazon allowed half stars, but I'll round up.   <br /> <br />I really wasn't sure what to expect of this novel, and was pleasantly surprised by how very, very much I enjoyed it.  It's always a treat to have a true can't-put-it-down page-turner to occupy a few evenings.  I had read about half of the author's fanfiction trilogy years ago, and while I loved her writing style, her Draco never fully worked for me as Draco.  He works much, much better in the original voice of Jace, in my mind.  So, while I was confident this book would be well-written, funny and a great fantasy setting, I wasn't at all sure if it would be my cup of tea or not.   <br /> <br />Clare has created some really memorable characters, and I'm always thrilled to find another great character-driven author.  I found most of the characters to be engaging, convincing and well-drawn (notably Jace, Clary, Luke and Alec).  I think the characters are this work's greatest strength (and am puzzled by the folks who found them to be flat and cliched).       <br /> <br />Without giving away spoilers, I would wager that further plot twists in the next 2 volumes may well reverse some of the Star Wars-ish revelations.  The set-up is subtle, but I suspect that things are not all that they appear at the end of this first installment.   <br /> <br />I think some of the reviewers here have made some fair points in terms of inconsistencies, small plot holes, some editing errors that probably should have been fixed, some POV problems, etc. (I too had to suspend disbelief that Luke would engage in such a long personal narrative of Jocelyn's backstory at that particular moment in the storyline for example).  But, an even larger number of the negative points seem to me to be more personal criticism directed at the author rather than honest and fair commentary on this novel.  I'd point out that it's likely some of the more negative reviews would be negative, regardless of whetherthe reviewer had actually read the book or not.  Sure, the plot and fantasy elements are derivative in some senses, but what YA fantasy book these days is completely original and non-derivative?  I am admittedly not too widely read in this genre generally speaking, so perhaps that colored my read --- but I would unhesitantly recommend this novel highly to fantasy and YA fans alike. <br /> <br />

B000MV9026|4.0|Okay, seriously why are people consistently saying they're surprised Happy Feet is not for very young kids when the movie is clearly rated \\"PG\\"??  Don't blame the movie for some of the sexy songs (which I thought were very funny and well done) when they warned you upfront with a big \\"PG\\" label.  Take some responsibility and do a little research before not hiring a babysitter for the night. :-) <br /> <br />I didn't find the environmental message to be over the top either but the movie is definitely two parts-- part 1 being about learning tolerance and cute penguins and part 2 about taking care of your environment and semi-stupid humans.    <br /> <br />But overall they did blend the two parts well and I laughed out loud so many times I had to buy this movie as soon as it came out.

It's not just Dylan....its Dylan sung live by Neil Young, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Willie Nelson, Ron Wood, June Carter & Johnny Cash, John Mellencamp, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Eddie Vedder, Tracy Chapman, Tom Petty, Johnny Winter, Richie Havens etc., etc. This recording is a classic, a virtual museum of music greats at the top of their form singing songs by one of the greatest song writers of our era. There is not a bad track on this 2 CD set. Buy this CD. You won't be sorry.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|This film is so intimate and well done that you feel like you are peeking through a keyhole; or you are the preverbial fly on the wall, privy to the inter-relationships of private lives.  The acting is superb.   The film has a documentary quality, given the uneven camera work, which only adds to it's \\"realness\\".  I particulary enjoyed istening to the commentary and appreciate the resourcefulness and ingenuity used by the film makers in getting this low budget project made, i.e., using their own cat, someones home (as a reward he was put into film), using actual kids from school, taking advantage of their \\"down time\\" which was filmed and added to the picture.   <br /> <br />Kudo's to the choice of Ryan Gosling, he is probably the best young actor around today; and Miss Epps....what a natural!
B000MP4ELY|4.0|I checked out Dario Argento's \\"Phenomena\\" as Volume 1 of the \\"Dario Argento Collection.\\"  This is the original 110-minute version of the 1985 film that was eventually edited down to the 82-minute edited version known in the U.S. as [[ASIN:B00030WW5I \\"Creepers\\"]]. I will have to check that out some time because less might actually be more in the case of this particular film.  I say that because I was ready to give up on this movie because halfway through the DVD kept coming to a stop.  I kept taking it out, cleaning it and blowing into the player, over and over again in an attending to get the offending dust mote or whatever.  Just before I decided to send the DVD back because I had no compelling reason to watch the rest of the film, I tried it on a different DVD player and found out that this horror film has an ending that you have to see in order to believe.<br /><br />\\"Phenomena\\" begins with a young girl (the director's daughter Fiore) getting off of a bus somewhere in the Swiss Alps and getting killed.  Fans of Argento knows he likes heads to break glass when people are getting killed and that happens for the first of two times in this film.  Eight months later Inspector Geiger (Patrick Bauchau) is still working the case, one of a string of murders, and consulting with Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasance), a wheelchair-bound insect specialist who knows all about what insects do to human corpses.  Then we meet 13-year-old Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly in her first lead role), who has been sent by her parents to a private girls academy.  Having an American movie star for a parent cuts no slack with the other girls, who ridicule Jennifer for being a sleepwalker who likes bugs.  The headmistress of the school denounces Jennifer as a \\"Lady of the Flies\\" while the local doctor is worried that Jennifer's sleepwalking is the first step towards developing a split personality (really, this is their diagnosis).  When the girls torment Jennifer she calls all of the insects around the school to her aid and you are thinking that what Argento is doing here is a variation of \\"Carrie,\\" where the tormented girl with the strange powers turns the table of her tormenters.  But there is still that unknown killer running around and Argento has no intention of taking full advantage of this strange little power.<br /><br />After getting the necessary explanations and exposition from Prof. McGregor, Jennifer actually uses one of her insect friends to find the spot along the bus route where the first girl was killed, which is rather original.  This is where the DVD I was watching started giving me headaches and I was ready to just give up on the film, because the only part that had really caught my attention was the chimpanzee that keeps Prof. McGregor company and who was stealing the movie from the human cast.  But I am certainly glad I watched the rest of \\"Phenomena\\" because that chimp has two of the better scenes in the entire movie and Argento pulls out all of the stops for the big finish.  The endgame of this film really erupts given how relatively tame the rest of the film has been up to this point.  There is a little bit of everything here in the effort to totally turn your stomach (I have to wonder if the makers of \\"Saw III\\" happened to catch this movie because of what Inspector Gieger does).<br /><br />The result is not even close to being a great film because the weaving together of the science fiction and horror elements is quite uneven, but then there comes a scene like the one where the chimp goes after a Japanese carp kite stuck in a tree on a moonlight night and suddenly I am really pay attention.  By the time Jennifer is following that phone cord the gloves are off.  I do not know if this is the one Dario Argento film you should see if you only see one of his macabre little films, but at the very least the last act of this film will definitely give you something to talk about.  I decided to round up on \\"Phenomena,\\" but itcould well be that whoever edited it down to \\"Creepers\\" helped the slow first half of this film so it could well be that the butchered American version ends up being a solid four.  If and when I check it out I will remember to come back here and render a verdict on that score.whoever edited it down to \\"Creepers\\" helped the slow first half of this film so it could well be that the butchered American version ends up being a solid four.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|i think b/c we like the iconic Bond so much and it is so iconic, that even a mediocore Bond movie will be good. in other words, a Bond movie is never \\"bad.\\" there's always something to outweigh something else. either the actor playing Bond is good, or the women are hot, or the action is good...but i'm not calling Casino Royale mediocre. it is good, but not great. i think all the acting is up to par, and there's good dialogue, yet positively, there's not too much dialogue, which makes movies boring. the dialogue is quick, sage, and has depth and meaning. it is concise. it isn't cheesy. yet i think the downfall is the script isn't up to par. it wasn't the actors fault. it's difficult to explain, but the story line wasn't engaging enough. but there's a lot of action. a lot of good action. that's where i give them an A. the 2nd opening scene has Daniel Craig chasing this guy with a backpack. they end up on those high beams in construction sites. whoa, those were some good stunts. it had me on the edge of my seat. and speaking of Mr. Craig, he gets an A+. and i'm not only talking about his rugged good looks, sexy voice, piercing diamond blue eyes, and sexy, manly body (damn he is HOTT!). i think his acting is A. this is Bond on his first assignment. Bond when he was just beginning. and like everyone else in an infantile stage, one is green, immature, believe you're invincible, and have a huge ego. that's exactly how Bond is in this movie, and i think Craig embodies those characteristics greatly. he effectively portrays Bond as naive, sensitive, but tough and cool. Craig has a good swagger for this \\"Pre-Bond.\\" this is a different type of Bond and it was refreshing to see a different side. but Bond will transform into the ultra-cool, aloof, womanizing, confident, unflinching type, and Craig, after haven been betrayed by the woman he's madly in love with (eva green), and yet to discover that her betrayal was to save his life, shows the transition in just one scene, the ending scene. he is now the Bond we all know and love. he is now rough and tough, and wiser, and essentially will not get emotional in any aspect of his work. he almost has no feelings anymore. and mainly he will now regard women as just a hit and run.lol....the one big and very few peeve i had with the film, was Eva Green as the Bond girl. i think she was terribly miscast. it is only my opinion but i don't see much sexuality in her. she is very thin and i don't think she's sexy. i don't want to sound mean, but i'm just stating what i felt, and that is, her face is not that pretty or compelling either. she is very bland. i think ms. green would be excellent in a dramatic movie, and probably look great in it too. but she is not supposed to be in a Bond movie. it's like she's out of place. she doesn't look like an \\"action\\" girl. more like period movies. she would be great in them. Bond women are always, sexy, and curvy, and have this certain spark, and i just felt that ms. green did not possess that spark. i mainly look forward to seeing the Bond girl, and i felt very dissapointed watching her. the mistress of the villain should have been the Bond girl. you don't have to be terribly beautiful, but at least sexy and have a spark and she had it more... all in all i recommend this movie. come on, you can't miss a Bond movie!
074356619X|1.0|What a joke!!  Rhonda thinks she has \\"discovered\\" some great new \\"Secret\\".  As do the rest of the people in the movie.  I guess none of them have ever read the Bible and discovered God's Secret.  I have news for all of them....Yes...There will be judgement for your actions.
1592400876|5.0|That just about sums it up. Every one of these negative reviews below had griped about her vocabulary, when most of them are blatantly ignoring the fact that British English makes use of some very different terminology than can be found in American English. <br /> <br />After reading the book, I still get a LOT of enjoyment out of it just from picking it up once in a while and opening it to a random page. Pick any paragraph on the page to read and I bet you'll laugh again too. <br /> <br />Of course, if you don't appreciate British humor (or should I say 'humour'?), then you should not read it because it will do little more than annoy the crap out of you. <br /> <br />For the rest of us, her informed-yet-cynical style of writing is very palatable and enjoyable to read, and I wish everyone could just figure out how the hell to use a semicolon!

B00005JPMC|4.0|It's riddled with masculine clich&eacute;s and by-the-numbers testosterone-driven plot elements, but \\"Shooter\\" is no reason for Mark Wahlberg to turn the gun on himself. On the heels of his Oscar-nominated work in \\"The Departed,\\" he leads the way in this action-packed roller-coaster romp of mayhem, suspense and, of course, machine guns.<br /><br />Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger, a retired military vet secluded in his mountain cabin with nothing but his dog, beer and cans of Dinty Moore beef stew. A misanthrope of sorts three years after the loss of his pal Donnie in combat, his guard is up with pistols drawn when Colonel Issac Johnson, played by the always excellent Danny Glover, and his underlings show up with an urgent request - help foil an incumbent assassination on the president.<br /><br />He eventually gives in after his patriotism is questioned and his ego ever-so-stroked, and becomes involved. Before it's too late, he realizes he's being framed. Just barely dodging an onslaught of bullets, he escapes with his life. Gentlemen, start your engines.<br /><br />Swagger finds himself the most wanted man in the nation in a matter of minutes, and barely dodges the police. Fortunately, he finds help in the form of disgraced FBI agent Nick Memphis, played Michael Pe&ntilde;a, and Sara Fenn, Donnie's widow, played by Kate Mara, who seems to lose her Kentucky accent as the plot progresses. In the latter he finds a makeshift nurse and someone in whom to confide, while in the former he finds an unlikely supporter who refuses to simply accept that Swagger is the culprit, especially when he finds telltale evidence to suggest the contrary.<br /><br />Glover disappears for a while, but he remains cool, calm and in character throughout. Also, Levon Helm of famed 70's rock group The Band injects the film with a shot of welcome levity in his scene as a folksy rifle expert, and it's great to see Ned Beatty still doing what he does best, even if his character of the devious Senator Meachum is an amalgamation of many he has played before. He even manages to pump a few genuine laughs into the script with his sardonic wit.<br /><br />Some important pieces of the movie's puzzle don't fit. It wouldn't be any easier to tell that Swagger is being set up by Johnson and his cohorts if it was spelled out in fireworks, so it's hard to believe Swagger would accept the assignment, patriotism or not. Also, one character's sudden transformation toward the end of the film (let's be vague lest we give away crucial plot elements) goes way beyond the threshold of unrealistic.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's all in fun, and that's exactly what \\"Shooter\\" is meant to be. The character of Swagger is the consummate unachievable archetype of what men aspire to be, and because of that \\"Shooter\\" is a vector of sorts - like all those good old John Wayne westerns - for harmless idealization. If you can accept that, see the film, and if your girlfriend can accept it too, bring her along.hum is an amalgamation of many he has played before.

B000N6U0E2|4.0|A few days ago I was Walking through Wal-Mart and i saw the display for this movie, and I thought to myself, hmm Will Smith how good can this be. But honestly this movie is one of the few movies that can accually inspire people to do things. From the cross-refrences to the Delcaration of independence, to the Oscar Worth proformance by both Will Smith and his son Jayden. From the time I put this DVD into the player, i could NOT stop watching. I hope you all get out there and see it. Its deffiantly worth buying, nevermind just renting.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Daniel Craig may well have done good in this film. Recently he has admitted that he wants the character of James Bond to be bisexual in the next installment, and that he himself wishes to star as the super-spy. <br /> <br />Does that mean in this next Bond flick, that he will have the very, very memorable Bond line be rewritten so that he says  'My name is Bond, Gay Bond' instead of the more well-known line ? <br />
B00006NSGX|5.0|This is one of the best live cd's I've ever listned to! <br />All the songs sound really tight, You can close your eyes and imagine your in the same room with Clapton. <br />The guitar work is second to know.

B000005RXH|4.0|It's too bad that this album and their debut have been disregarded when they became more successful. Both are excellent Supertramp \\"starters\\".  Bit this album is the beginning of the \\"classic\\" Supertramp sound that's captured fans all over the world. If \\"Supertramp\\" was Roger Hodgson's go at the mike, than this is Rick Davies turn to clearly show what he's got to offer us. Unlike their debut, this album is more upbeat, rock-oriented atmosphere, and also has a mixture of different musical styles. \\"Your Poppa Don't Mind\\" \\"Remember\\" and \\"Potter\\" all have the rock/jazz/blues hybrid to them, while songs like \\"Travelled\\" and \\"Aries\\" tend to have the sad mood from the first album, and all the other songs songs have pretty much everything inbetween. Overall it's not a bad album, weak in some spots though, especially \\"Rosie Had Everything Planned\\" seems a little pointless. But don't let that stop you from getting this album! It's an intro to the Supertramp \\"sound\\" and I recommend it highly as well their first!
0743496728|4.0|Ok I have read almost all of Jodi Picoult's novel and my personal favorites are My sister's keeper and plain truth and I did love this book but I'm sorry I have a problem with the twist at the end with Josie and I really have a problem with the ending of how Alex just seems to go on with her life with Patrick. It just seems like Jodi's editor needed her to add atwist that wasn't there at first and now it seems real last minute and not realistic at all. I just don't picture Josi doing what she does at the end. Anyway for the most part the book was eye opening, and thought provoking and had great character development. It was a very good read as usual and the ending for Peter was especially emotional for me cause even though what he did was extremely tragic  I felt like he needed help in the end.
B000M06K5C|1.0|To the same level that \\"Silent Alarm\\" was a refreshing burst of high octane original post punk rock n' roll \\"Weekend in the City\\" is a disappointing pyre of overproduced electronic ennui.  I appreciate Bloc Party's artistic ambition in making such a radical departure from their previous sound, but not the art.  Even the standout track, \\"Uniform,\\" which if taken as seriously as it takes itself, demands comparison to the much more subtle \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" and in that context it leaves one with \\"a sense of disappointment.\\"
B000N6U0E2|5.0|A movie with a rare charisma: It can make you laugh and cry on the same time. It certainly reminded me the movie \\"La Vita e Bella\\" not just because of that but also because it  depicts the relationship of a father with his son under extremely difficult circumstances.<br /><br />It is based on a true story which adds to its beauty, not to mention that the chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden is just real life.<br /><br />I was impressed with how devoted this man was in everything he was doing. What a nightmare trying to sell these scanners! Yet, that was what he was stuck with and he was trying to do the best out of it.<br /><br />A movie with a lot of positive messages about life relationships which can help someone see the difficulties he goes through under a different prospective. Of course it brings up the phenomenon of homeless people in the richest country of the world. I highly recommend it although at the end I wanted to see a little bit more about the new life of Chris Gardner.<br /><br />For the end a word of CAUTION: Money definitely contributes to happiness but does not guarantee it...

B000BGH22W|3.0|One of the joys for me of the John Williams \\"Harry Potter\\" scores are the lush, melodic leitmotifs.  On \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" album alone there are wonderful themes for Fawkes, Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart, not to mention Colin, Hedwig and The Flying Car.  They're charming, evocative pieces that stand alone apart from the moodier, more percussive tracks composed to accompany the actual movie.  Unfortunately, there's nothing that even comes close to these in Doyle's  \\"Goblet of Fire\\" score.  There's certainly drama (\\"The Maze\\") and pathos (\\"Death of Cedric\\"), but nothing thematic that you'd want to hear over and over again.  And what themes there are (\\"Neville's Waltz\\" for instance) I find woefully banal.  (And don't get me started on the acid rock songs that close the album.)  So this is a true movie score in the sense that it's pretty much all background music; it certainly creates atmosphere and serves as a reminder of the film's superlative visuals.  But what works well in the theater doesn't translate very well for the home audio listener.

However, after reading this book, I doubt very much that the various shoes I've owned are constructed in the same manner, so I haven't gained any useful insights.  I'm still stuck with price-tag as a mediator of quality, which I hate.
1576466280|5.0|Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1878) is among the earliest published works of Robert Louis Stevenson, and yet it is in no way inferior to his later writing that established his fame. In fact, this delightful account of Stevenson's solo trek in the Cevennes Range in south central France ranks among the best travel literature in the nineteenth century.    Wishing not to advertise that he would be camping alone in remote areas, he chose not to travel with a tent.  Instead, he designed a sleeping sack some six feet square, made of green water-proof cart cloth without and blue sheep's fur within. This commodious bed was too heavy to carry, and thus Stevenson acquired a donkey, one Modestine.    Stevenson and Modestine for twelve days were close companions, traveling some 120 miles over several mountain ridges, along rocky roads, and even through boggy marshes. The stubborn Modestine was never quite convinced that the journey was entirely worth the effort, but nonetheless Stevenson and Modestine eventually became fast friends.    Stevenson actually found lodging most nights, including a stint at a monastery, Our Lady of the Snows, allowing him not only to sleep more comfortably, but to share meals with strangers. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is as much about the people Stevenson encountered as about his adventuresome travels through this remote region of France. My only criticism of this short account, a little more than one hundred pages, is that it is not twice as long.    Stevenson was familiar with the history of the Cevennes, especially the Protestant-Catholic strife under Louis XIV that eventually resulted in a Protestant rebellion in 1702. With the passage of nearly two hundred years, the Protestants and Catholics were now living peacefully together, although these two peoples seldom mixed socially and intermarriages were quite rare.  Stevenson himself was Protestant, and while staying at the monastery his hosts made sincere efforts to convert himto the Catholic faith.     The young Robert Louis Stevenson was a rare individual that truly enjoyed life, one that was continually fascinated with his chanced acquaintances. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is delightful and amusing, but at the same time it is equally successful as a thoughtful examination of the people of the Cevennes, isolated by both mountainous geography and a minority religion.

B000NA28A2|5.0|El nuevo disco de Juan Luis Guerra es, sencillamente, perfecto. Desde sus inteligentes rimas hasta sus pegajosos ritmos, \\"La Llave de mi Corazón\\" es definitivamente una de las mejores producciones latinas del 2007 y, probablemente, en la obra de Juan Luis Guerra.    El genio musical de Guerra es indiscutible: desde merengüe hasta salsa, desde bachata hasta jazz latino - este disco es una delicia auditiva desde principio a fin. Los arreglos de cuerdas, de voces y de vientos (saxofones, trompetas, etc) acentúan en el momento perfecto en cada canción. Con armonías hermosamente enloquecedoras y una producción fenomenal, Guerra definitivamente se llevará un viaje a los Grammys y los Latin Grammys (me compadezco de sus contrincantes :-)    La letra de éste álbum es inteligente, romántica, poética y ¡hasta en inglés! De pronto, me encuentro cantándole a mi esposa uno que otro verso de cualquier canción de éste disco. No me estuviese raro si voy a alguna boda y esucho dos o tres canciones de éste disco. Verdaderamente escrito con el corazón, areglado con la cabeza y cantado con el alma. Juan Luis Guerra no dejó nada atrás. ¡Nadie se debe negar éste álbum!    ¡Que Disfruten!    NOTA: ¡Felicidades a JLG en los 5 Latin Grammy que éste álbum ha recibido! Bien merecidos. No se pierdan este álbum :-)
0385495323|5.0|The Author uses key events in history to explain how the codemakers were engaged in a battle of wits with the codebreakers (cryptanalysts) of the opposite camp, and why at different times either side prevailed, thus influencing the course of history. <br /> While codemakers started with upper hand from the era of Romans to Arabs, the codebreakers start to strike back by deciphering cipher codes like the substitution and vignere ciphers using techniques like frequency analysis. We then see how codebreakers played their role in victory during protestant-catholic power struggle in England , and other occasions including Crimean war, World War I . It was with the mechanised encrypting machine Enigma that the Codemakers made a comeback, presenting a severe challenge to the cryptanalysts during World War II. Though Navajo language based codes were successfully employed by the US during WW II, this period marked the time when cryptanalysis slowly moved away from the domain of linguists to the mathematicians.  Enigma was eventually cracked by the expert mathematicians from Poland and England. Turing who cracked the modified Enigma so crucial to allied victory, was a key figure in early development of computers (a Turing award is equivalent to a nobel prize in computers).  <br /> With Enigma cracked, the codebreakers had once again the upperhand. Key distribution was a weak link often open to theft and spying, which always left it vulnerable. Diffie-hellman-Merkle came up with the solution of public key cryptography, where the common key was calculated locally without being distributed on any medium. It would take enormous resources of distributed computing to break the key, which requires either government organisations like NSA or large collobaration in Internet.  <br /> Finally the ethical dilemma of privacy vs security is discussed. Should Governments allow private citizens to have the capability to generate unbreakable codes, or should it retain its capability to breakinto any codes. <br /> The promise of Quantum crytography to provide unbreakable code guaranteed by physical law, will be a headache for future government policy makers.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|A classic movie. A timeless story. Like a lost lover's voice, this movie lingers in your memory with such sweet and tender aftertaste.  Ennio Morricone's exquisite sound track filled my consciousness as I type these words, even though I have not seen this movies for almost a year. If you are a foreign movie fan, this movie should already be in your collection. If you have not seen a foreign movie, let your journey commence here.<br /><br />I hope this version on Amazon contains both the original and the director's cut as advertised.  The director's cut, though more fulfilling, does not pack the emotional longings of the orignal version; however, you'll want to see both. Other than these thoughts, I say no more for others have thoughtfully done so.

We get a chance to watch him communcate lovingly with his muse and their relationship always stirs the soul.

B000002TQV|5.0|And it may not even be rocket science, but \\"The Bends\\" proves that the band can make good songs even without the sonic wows that made later works in [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] and [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. For me, these albums kind of make a Radiohead trilogy. Later albums in their catalog would even borrow from these two. Hints of what is to come later are here actually, even in the first few notes of \\"Planet Telex,\\" with its sort of spacey vibe. Radiohead isn't for the listener who wants fist-pumping music or something you blast out in the car. Instead, they are more like the band you'd listen to in isolation. And while some people question the band's sincerity, to me this is irrelevnat -- these songs would be great either way.    They didn't like being plagued as \\"the 'Creep' band\\" and on here this shows that there's much more to Radiohead than one hit. And \\"High and Dry\\" is just as catchy if you want something instant or moving. There is no real filler here, and while \\"OK\\" might be better, I actually like this one a little more. The tracks are a bit more standout-ish for me. They do the acoustics quite well, like in the chill-out folk-ish \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" or the brilliant classic \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" or even the underrated and gorgeous \\"Bullet Proof (I Wish I Was).\\" I love listening to this album (and band) when I'm in after a hectic day and hear their calm and relaxing music. And there is distortion on the album as well. \\"Just\\" and \\"My Iron Lung\\" use some and are both highlights of the album. The former is probably my favorite on this album and the latter is a catchy number with memorable riffs, and a line saying that the song's a total waste of time. There is some sarcastic humor in the tracks, although alienation is a big theme of the group. I really like the chords on tracks like \\"(nice dream)\\" though. No lowlights, really.    This wouldn't be a bad start for your ownership on albums from the band. And compared to what came later, this mightactually be the most streamlined of their efforts. Yes, it's pop music, but it's great pop music at that. And people overlook its influence, as it's been often imitated, but never duplicated. This and Jeff Buckley's [[ASIN:B0000029DD Grace]] are the quintessential mid-90's with impact on the Britpop scene of then.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The most telling comment on this album:<br /><br />Ed O'Brien, guitarist for Radiohead, in an online journal during the studio sessions for KID A, noted that he had listened to LONDON CALLING that day and that it had made him depressed because (paraphrasing here) \\"no one's ever going to make anything better than this, so why even try?\\"<br /><br />It's THAT good.

B000N3SRRC|5.0|Wow! Clutch again , takes it to another level! They morph their sounds into a perfect mix of Rock/Blues/Funk and border on the hard side long enough to keep your attention. With melodic riffs that rival even the \\"bigger\\" bands, Clutch once again comes through with a masterpiece. With the catchy opener to my personal favorite : Cadilakness, this CD will find a permanent home in your car stereo. Buy it!! You wont regret it!
B000NA2776|5.0|I never had any interest in Pop music - finding it unimaginative and repetitive (when someone has a classical background - most pop music is boring) - however, when a friend gave me this CD as a gift - I listened to it and found it extremely fun. Absolutely refreshing. Maybe it has references to other artists - but the nice melodies, beautiful orchestration and some very wacky things that appear in some tracks are very very amusing (like the Grace Kelly sampled voice in \\"Grace Kelly\\"). This is probably not for the mundane, easy-listening customer and I found very impressive his astounding 5-octave vocal range. The tongue-in-cheek attitude is also fun - I don't know much about pop music, but I find this absolutely delicious.
B00003CX5P|3.0|As a huge fan of Star Wars, I was disappointed with the acting in this movie. In the first three movies ever made the cast had character, memorable character, and this movie doesn't have the same flair. However, the story had to be told. The highlights in this movie are the light saber duels, Darth Maul, the pod racing, and Obi-Wan-Kenobi.<br /><br />You must watch it if you want to find out the origin of Darth Vader.<br /><br />If you are a Star Wars fan buy it and be a judge for yourself. You will be entertained.
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid are a band I've been aware of for a long time but only REALLY started paying attention to in recent years. I actually had this burned for awhile, and I didn't realize that I didn't take to it as much as I have now! But what makes this record so great? The songs! Punk has never been about technical ability, and I always found that a little refreshing really, but Rancid may have their big '77 punk influence here, there's also kind of a style of their own on here. In fact, this record was too good for the mainstream to ignore, and it even got some MTV play and gave 'em more sales. Perfect timing too, as them and the Offspring were some of the biggest bands on Epitaph. <br /> <br />But it can appeal to the masses and has nice enough messages. The [[ASIN:B000001IP9 first album]] was recorded before Lars got into the band, and this one has his vocals on it. It's nice to hear the trade of his hard-edged and clear vocals and Tim's vocals which by contrast are more thin and less telligible. It's actually kind of charming. It's hard for me to pick my favorites between the first five songs, but those are not the only great tracks. Tracks like \\"Ghetto Box\\" and \\"Motorcycle Ride\\" stand out just as well. 23 songs takes awhile to fully adjust to, but once you're familiar, you won't want to stop listening to this. I am also very well aware of [[ASIN:B000001IQH ...And Out Come The Wolves]] and [[ASIN:B0000AI44R Indestructible]], which I enjoy. The other three I'm not quite as familiar with yet but they've all been at least four-star good with me by this point.
B0000019PA|5.0|This album ABSOLUTELY BLOWS . . . in the ears of sad, soulless, empty human beings.<br /><br />I'm sorry for that guy.<br /><br />He can probably tell you a LOT about notes and chords.<br /><br />He can probably tell you a LOT about music history.<br /><br />I doubt he can tell you ANYTHING about the heart.<br /><br />This album can tell you pretty much everything about it.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Bought this for my wife and She absolutly loves it, so that is good enough for me.
0770430074|5.0|When I get into a mood to read fiction, this is one of my favorite books to meet that need. I first read it not long after it came out, and it's been a well-love story ever since then. <br /> <br />Here we have this fantastic tale of a boy who grows up in India with a family who owns the Pondicherry zoo. Intelligent and curious, he proceeeds to embrace several religions--Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam--all while learning about animal behavior and related observations. When his family decides to move to Canada, they and some of the animals they've sold end up in a shipwreck; Pi, our protagonist, is left stranded on a life boat with a wounded zebra, an orangutan, a hyena--and a full grown Bengal tiger. What happens next is an amazing story of survival mixed with philosophy and the effects an ordeal can have on a person.  <br /> <br />The book is so well written that I forgot many times it was only fiction. Martel's characters--even the nonhuman ones--are believable and well-rounded, and the narration drew me in until I couldn't put the book down because I just had to read \\"a few more pages\\".  <br /> <br />This is an excellently crafted tale, one that raises questions about religion and belief, survival and instinct, and all while retaining hope. Highly recommended if you like your fiction to make you think.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|This is definitely their least enjoyable album. I was pretty disappointed with all but one maybe two songs.
1582701709|5.0|Just confirms my own opinion and outlook on life.  You're the only one holding yourself back!  A fast and easy read.  Enlightning.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I think the four-hour saga of \\"Gettysburg\\" might be one of Ted Turner's enduring positive gifts to the world. This is worth seeing just for the performances of Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, the heroic Yankee, and Kevin Conway as Sgt. Buster Kilrain, the non-commissioned officer who saw his worth and gave him confidence. The fact that it was filmed on the actual battlefield (with modern roads, buildings and monuments erased via computer) is a plus. It is a balanced mixture of talk, both brave and brooding, and action, both glorious and gory.
0452287588|5.0|If you like Tolle's previous works you will enjoy his latest effort.  Many thought provoking ideas. This book is an expansion on the ideas presented in his previous books viewed from different angles. Can't count the number of times I had to stop reading and ponder some of the topics.
1582701709|4.0|I think \\"The Secret\\" is terrific as a booster and reminder to stay focused on what we want and to maintain a positive state of mind.  If this is all you need to do to have the quality of life that you wish, then you need go no further.  But as is the case with most of the people that I deal with, we need more to fulfill our objectives. <br /> <br />Many elements need to be working in harmony to fulfill your goals.  Here are some questions to help you accomplish what you want: <br />1.  Do you have clear specific measurable goals, so specific that anyone can easily understand what you want?  Most goals require the assistance of others. <br />2.  Do you know what your values are (freedom, love, contribution), and are they in harmony with a particular goal? <br />3.  Do you have the skills (organizing, communicating, persuading) to achieve what you want, or can you get the support of someone who has the necessary skills? <br />4.  Do you have the traits (dependable, hardworking, friendly) to be able to succeed? <br />5.  Are you able to uncover and remove any negative limiting beliefs that you may have about yourself (\\"I don't deserve to be loved\\") or a particular objective (\\"This will never work)? <br />6.  Can you establish the positive beliefs within yourself (\\"I can be healthy\\") that will enable to achieve what you want? <br />7.  Do you have access to the required resources to make things happen (money, equipment, people)? <br />Also, are you able to keep yourself consistently motivated by understanding what the negative consequences are if you don't achieve a goal, and what the wonderful benefits are if you do achieve the goal? <br /> <br />This may seem like a lot to deal with, but look at people who are achieving their dreams and how they consciously or unconsciously implementing the above.  This is why I recommend \\"Anatomy of Success\\" by Ronald A. Kaufman, which gives you a straightforward step-by-step system for incorporating all the necessary elements in oneplace.  The book is filled with real world examples, tools, and techniques, and includes checklists for career, as well as a checklist of `101' questions to ask before you begin or end a relationship, which in itself can be priceless.
B00008972S|5.0|I gave my daughter this 2 disc edition for Christmas and now have gotten to see the extras that are included on the second disc. The movie itself looks great with what I think are improvements to the stage production (switching Cool and Gee Officer Krupke; Swapping America & Tonight; Adding the boys to America) but I wish they had not omitted the ballet sequence.  Get the cast recording with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert to hear how great the ballet sequence sounds.   <br /> <br />This is a musical that deserves to be seen on a big screen (or at least a big screen tv with a killer sound system) to be appreciated for the wonderful score.  Everything that could be said about the songs Bernstein and Sondheim wrote has been said so I can't add anything there.  Forget the idea of Natalie Wood playing a Puerto Rican and enjoy a great movie.  And see the stage production if it ever comes to your town.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|The movie is still amazing, and in Blu-ray on a big screen HDtv, it's only missing the popcorn smell or you'd think you were in a theater.  Amazon, as usual, was quick and efficient!
0743501594|4.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is a very entertaining story told in the same general formula as \\"The Davinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\". Unfortunately the abridged version leaves out most of the thoroughly researched detail that make Dan Brown's books so believable.
0142004235|5.0|This and \\"Of mice and men\\" have made me a total Steinbeck nut. Im serious, this guy can write! Timshel, I will never forget that word. I really wont, and anyone thats ever read the book will know exactly what Im talking about. I picked this book up after reading \\"of mice and men\\" which totally blew me away, not much caring for the prostituted OPRAH label on it, but because the title was intriguing. It centers in around the themes of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, not in a religious sense but in more of a human kind form of looking at life. The defects of life and society are portrayed to a point where you really gotta sit back and think for a bit. I loved the characters too. I really felt like i Knew Sam hamilton. I loved it. Pick it up. Its a keeper.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Before the frachise hit rock-bottom with the ill-fated \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" and before it was gloriously revived with the spectacular \\"Batman Begins\\" (which in my humble opinion is even better than this film), there was Tim Burton's \\"Batman.\\" Utilizing a huge market campaign and boasting top-name stars such as Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger, the film became one of 1989's biggest hits, earning over $251 million domestically. A lot of people loved this film (and quite a few of them still do today), but when I first saw it when I was a kid I really didn't care for it. But as I'm much older, I've warmed up to it.<br /><br />The film boasts an impressive production design (which earned a well-deserved Oscar) with casts Gotham as a moody, Gothic place in the mold of the twenty-first century, with distinct 1940s and 1980s flavor. The score by Danny Elfman is a wonderful orchestral score that has some of the heroism of John Williams's \\"Superman\\" theme but with a moody and oppressive tone to it. And the acting is fairly good -- Michael Keaton makes for a quiet, unassuming Bruce Wayne (but unimpressive Batman), Jack Nicholson makes for a wonderfully loony and twisted Joker and Michael Gough makes for a homely, well-mannered Alfred.<br /><br />However, the film is immensely flawed. The plot doesn't detail about how Bruce Wayne became Batman (save for one or two flashbacks) and the backstory of who kills Bruce Wayne's parents is dramatically altered to focus on the villain. And Batman's entrances were always too dramatic, such as the opening scene where he frightens off the robbers by just raising his cape and the scene where he rescues Vicki Vale by crashing in through the skylight. (I always pictured Batman as a less dramatic and more scary superhero who catches his victims completely off guard, like in the Timm/Dini animated series or in 2005's \\"Batman Begins\\".) And while Jack Nicholson is indeed great as the Joker, he hogs too much screentime and relegates Keaton as a supporting character and not the leading character as the film's title asserts. And let's not forget Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale -- while Basinger is certainly very beautiful, the script requires her character to scream often (probably took a cue from Kate Capshaw in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\", but Basinger does have a great scream) and the script just renders her two-dimensional. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining to a fault and while it isn't one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it is responsible for reviving comic-book superhero movies up into the mid-90s where \\"Batman & Robin\\" ran the Batman franchise into the ground.<br /><br />When the movie was first released on DVD in late 1997 as one of Warner Brothers's first titles to debut on the new home video format, without much in the way of extras and was a flipper disc (with open matte full-screen and anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen transfers on either side), packaged in Warner's now-thankfully extinct snapper cases. With the impending arrival of \\"Batman Begins\\" on DVD in October 2005, Warner Brothers saw fit to give all four Batman movies a new digital transfer and provide quality extras for each film. And is the upgrade worth it? A resounding yes.<br /><br />First off, the transfer. Compared to the 1997 DVD, the new 2005 digital transfer is a revelation. The 1997 DVD had boosted black levels, an unnaturally high level of film grain, and the low-lit scenes looked really murky. The 2005 transfer fixes all these problems -- the transfer is brighter, more natural-looking and much cleaner. Much of the unnecessary grain has been removed but enough has been left to maintain a good film-like texture. You can finally make out the details in the darker scenes and overall the video transfer is very pleasing. The disc still has the original Dolby Digital 5.1 remix from the old DVD, but a brand-new DTS mix is offered. The tracks sound good for their age, but are front-centric mainly, with some panning effects (like during the Batmobile chase) and occasional use of the surrounds, which make Elfman's score sound even better. The DTS track sounds a bit more robust and clearer than the Dolby track, but it's not the Batman film to show off your surround system (like \\"Batman Begins\\" or even \\"Batman & Robin\\"). An optional French stereo dub is provided, alongside optional subtitles in English, French or Spanish.<br /><br />Now, the extras. We get a commentary from Burton and the then-highly anticipated theatrical trailer for the film on the first disc. The commentary is good, but Burton has the tendency to stop for long stretches of time and just watch the movie. A cast or crew member sitting with him could've made the commentary more engaging, but it's good for some of the information Burton tells us. The theatrical trailer is presented in anamorphic widescreen with stereo audio, but it's pretty dull for the most part (it's mostly large chunks of footage put together with Elfman's score in the background). Still, it's good for archival purposes. The movie is divided into 38 chapters, and the main menu is animated against a brief excerpt of Elfman's main title theme.<br /><br />But the second disc is just exhaustive in terms of the quantity and quality of extras. There are three documentaries (\\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\", \\"Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic History of the Dark Knight\\" and \\"Beyond Batman\\") -- most of which are divided into smaller chunks for easier access. Most of the documentaries feature new interviews with the cast and crew of \\"Batman\\", such as Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Kim Basinger, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Nicholson, Sam Hamm and would-be Vicki Vale Sean Young. All of the new interviews provide some nice behind-the-scenes info about the movie and what happened after. Additionally, there are mini profiles about the main characters of the movie, most of them featuring new interviews with the cast (\\"Batman: The Heroes\\" and \\"Batman: The Villains\\") and a vintage 1989 featurette \\"On the Set with Bob Kane\\". As a nice touch, there's a storyboarded deleted scene featuring the voices of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (who provide the voices for the Tim/Dini Batman animated series) and a collection of music videos Prince contributed to the film (\\"Partyman\\", \\"Scandalous\\" and \\"Batdance\\"). Still menus are offered on the second disc, although there's music on the main menu only.<br /><br />This set is available separately or can be purchased as part of the \\"Complete Batman Anthology\\", which boxes up this edition along with the other special editions of the three successive Batman sequels. The 1997 disc is also available (for a much lower price than this edition), but I highly recommend this edition if you still haven't got a copy of this movie yet. The video transfer (and the fact that it's in a keep case) alone is worth the upgrade.with some panning effects (like during the Batmobile chase) and occasional use of the surrounds, which make Elfman's score sound even better.

075640407X|5.0|Name of the Wind is the best thing to take to bed besides a significant other. You can lose yourself in the characters and the world from page one, and I emphasize characters. You will want to know as much as you can about all the people, even the side characters, and you will want to stay in this world for as long as you possibly can. This is both a strength and a weakness because it is so deep, that you definitely will want to make time to go on this journey. And how many people have a few days to totally immerse themselves in a book? Best to have some vacation time coming up, or some time where you can run away with this book and hide with it until you have taken the quest from cover to cover. Don't let it sit on your shelf for too long to tantalize you, because it will haunt you until you have picked it back up and opened the cover again. I know there is another review like this one, and I agree with it completely. Read this book! You will discover a rare treat that will refresh your hope in the genre.
B00005JMUA|4.0|How do you follow a bloody, though often slow at times, sword-fighting extravaganza? Any attempt to either recreate the magic of the first movie or go off in an entirely different direction would be very risky. It is even more risky to place the fate of your movie in the hands of David Carradine. To say that, for the most part, swords will stay sheathed and instead acting will rule the day in Volume 2 was an interesting move and had you told me ahead of time that it would be so, I would not have believed you. After the fact, I can say that David Carradine is a star.  <br /> <br />After much deliberation, I feel that I liked Volume 2 better than Volume 1. There were no characters that I enjoyed in Volume 1, while I loved the introduction of both Pai Mei (the martial arts master) and Esteban Vihaio (Bill's Spanish-speaking father figure). The highlight, however, was Bill. <br /> <br />He is a charismatic man to whom it would seem everyone takes a liking. His scratchy voice, which borders on a whisper, somehow soothes and calms. No one should wonder how he, with his charm; inteligence; and martial arts ability, rose to his position of power. And yet based upon what we know about Bill's relationship with The Bride, it is no surprise that the series is titled \\"Kill Bill.\\"  <br /> <br />I never expected to be so impressed with the writing in a Quentin Tarantino film. The story, though cheesy, was well planned out and the dialogue was perfect for the feel and direction of the film. The plot of the first movie was like a bunch of boulders placed next to each other, and Volume 2 was the sand poured over them to fill in the gaps. Most of Volume 2 was the back story which was lacking from Volume 1, but not so noticeably absent that it was not entertaining. There were questions that went unanswered until the second installment, which is expected in a series.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volume 2 added depth to the plot and the characters introduced in Volume 1. It featured martial-arts fighting scenes, but introduced more verbal sparring than its prequel. Uma Thurman is the headlining star of the Kill Bill series, but David Carradine stole the show when he breathed life into Bill while The Bride tried to take it away.  <br />
074356619X|1.0|This book was an insult to my intellegence.  It uses broad concepts that are familiar to THE  Bible. IE: ask for  universe for anything, praise the universe for all good things. It goes on to prophetiZe that you need to throw  thoughts out to the universe and they will come back to you. IE: money and all material gains, desires for prosperty and success. It  uses  visualization. Think money and it will come to you.<br /><br />The whole book (on cd) and including the DVD which is  verbatum to the book--various people sitting  behind the desk talking at you--is ridiculous,boring and not backed up scientifically.<br /><br />It is a promising  for mental midgets--. Never once did it mention God, and yet, it stole all the powers  regarding a heavenly being.<br /><br />It elaborated  on the universe and its energy forces, void of any spirituality.  I stress this because it was so close to spirituality(excluding desires and material gains) but wanted the credit to go to The Secret-which is no secret at all!
B000002NC4|5.0|Perfect From Now On is Built to Spill's third album and gained widespread attention when it was released in 1997. A long vast & epic voyage through 8 noise shifting songs. Perfect From Now On was at the time their tightest sounding album yet, and first major-label release on Warner Bros. Perfect from Now On is filled w/ wailing guitar effects and groove-laden blissful jams. So many twists and turns throughout. Just more of a broadened scope, deeper range and timelessness here.<br />Yes, these are LONG songs, approaching times between 5 and 9 minutes each. This release reminds me a bit of Neutral Milk Hotel. PERFECT FROM NOW ON is filled with colorful rawness, a beautiful mess.<br />While their next album \\"Keep It Like A Secret\\" is catchier, shorter and poppy.<br /> At this time(1997) the band consists of Doug Martsch: singer/guitarist - his vocals are farther ranging, more matured & more exquisite then on \\"There's Nothing Wrong With Love,\\" Along w/ band -also adding MORE muscle, depth & volume; takes it's listener on a real experience of adventure<br />Brett Netson: bass & guitar; and drummer Scott Plouf.<br />Built to Spill is one of the more important talented bands that more people need to hear. Constantly changing styles and band members w/ each release. And this is their most creative, mesmerizing, most psychadelic sound put out by them. Favorite song: \\"Kicked It In the Sun.\\" - I also LOVE opener: \\"Randy Described Eternity\\" - \\"I Would Hurt A Fly\\" - \\"Velvet Waltz\\" - \\"Untrustable/Part 2.\\"<br />To me this is close to PERFECTION and my Favorite Built to Spill record so far as of 2007. 5 stars!

B000N3ST8O|4.0|It would be difficult to recommend this disc without the DVD- finally, most of Stevie's music videos are out on DVD, including the rarely seen \\"Scarlett\\" version of \\"Stand Back.\\" The commentaries are interesting for the most part, with amusing anecdotes spread throughout by Stevie. And the \\"Making of Bella Donna\\" segment is interesting as well. The CD itself, well it's hard to get too excited about another \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection. I mean, most everything here is already available on her previous \\"Best of\\" collections, Timespace and Enchanted. Plus, it's hard to imagine a \\"Best of\\" collection without either Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You or Beauty and the Beast. If you're a casual fan, I'd recommend Timespace over this collection any day, because that album features a better, more balanced selection.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|Imagine my utter surprise when I saw Volver and discovered that Penelope Cruz can actually act. I have never been a fan of her's due to her incompetence but in her native language, Cruz shined quite clearly and it was almost refreshing to see her act in amost natural way. I read once that many foreign actors or actresses often get stale when acting in a language which is not their native tongue. Penelope Cruz to me, seem to be a perfect example. But in Volver, she seem to be all that she hyped up to me.<br /><br />The movie deals with woman, her mother and her family which lies shrouded in mystery, lies and deception. I would say that this movie is a \\"girl flick\\" per say since most guys won't really have to see this and if they did, see it again. But the movie proves to be well scripted, very well acted and despite of the subtitles, the flair of the movie come through very well. That is credited to the director who did a fine job.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty worthy movie that revealed Penelope Cruz as a fine actress and make people forget her American movies like Sahara!
B00005NP04|5.0|In fact, I would not have been able to tell you who sang a single one of the tracks on this CD until a couple of weeks ago. I borrowed a vehicle and this CD was in it so I decided to give it a listen. I listened from one end to the other and totally enjoyed myself. If this had been a concert, I would have been absolutely thrilled with the variety of styles and pacing. Plus, these songs have catchy hooks and they're fun to sing along with.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan but I am now!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Watching this movie was watching a train wreck.  It was a magnificant movie and painful for me to watch, because as a substance abuse counselor I have worked with clients with their lives wrecked, hope gone and who continue to live in a state of denial and too often death. <br /> <br />This movie takes you on a journey of hope and disaster with a sense of realism that is frightening. Anyone who has never taken drugs and would like to know the journey that addicts take will not be disappointed.  It will leave you drained and in pain for the characters. <br /> <br />It was especially painful for me since I know that this path that was taken in the movie is all too real for thousands of young people.  When you watch this movie, note how slowly the drugs infects the morality and reality of the characters. They do not see the train until it runs them over and they are trapped.   <br /> <br />The ending is somewhat vague so one can hope that they will somehow escape.
B000BHN7DE|4.0|I got a chance to buy this album after saving up some money for it.  I thought I was getting a CD set in a typical case, but Sony decided to make it in the size of a book, and put the CD's in the sleeves of the book, which I don't like about the CD set.  The 1st CD has some of her best CD's, and I believe they were put in the order of song's release.  I'm Outta Love gave Anastacia her big break.  Not That Kind is ok, but not my overall favorite though.  Cowboys & Kisses sounds a bit country, which had this song been released in the United States, it might have been lucky to get promoted on AC stations, as Pop stations wouldn't have touched this song.  As for the Freak of Nature Album, Paid my Dues being a song about Anastacia finally making it big in the music business.  I usually don't hear songs about that.  One Day in Your Life is the European version, where it sounds a bit computerized, plus the song fades out as she sings toward the end, where the American version had a few extra seconds of instrumental music at the end.  I prefer the American version better.  Why'd You Lie to Me reminds me of someone that cheated on me, and can relate to the song.  You'll Never Be Alone is one of my favorite love songs.   <br />From the Anastacia album, this album has Left Outside Alone, which is my overall favorite song from her.  It has a rock sound to it.  I only wished Sony did a better job trying to promote this song in the United States, but they didn't do a good job at it.  Sick & Tired & Heavy on My Heart, being emotional songs, talking about her struggle with Breast Cancer, and overcoming it.  As for the New Songs, I like the duet she did with Ben Moody, and the song also appears on the Fantastic Four Soundtrack.  I Belong to You would be a good song in my book, if Eros Rammonazzi (Don't believe the name is spelled right) sang his part in English, instead of Italian.  Now if this album had been released in the United States, that song would either have been sung withsomeone else in place of Eros, or removed completely.  The Club Megamix should have been left off of disc 1, as it didn't sound right at all.  It was mish-mashed songs, which I don't like.  The 2nd disc has the remixes, which is where I want to hear the remixes. <br />As for Dance remixes, I heard the I'm Outta Love [Hex Hector Radio Edit] at a South Bend Indiana nightclub in 2000, which exposed me to Anastacia's music.  Left Outside Alone [M*A*S*H Radio Mix] sounds a bit bland, but the Jason Nevins Global Club Edit of the same song fits the lyrics & beat better.  Sick and Tired [Jason Nevins Funkrock Remix Edit] in my opinion shouldn't even been remixed.  To me, it doesn't sound right speeded up.  One Day in Your Life [Hex Hector/Mac Quayle Club Mix] is a bit too long for my listening preference.  The Almighty Mix version of the same song fits my style better.  Love Is a Crime [Thunderpuss Club Mix] & Cotto's Doin' the Crime Mix are both good remixes, and couldn't stop listening to them.  I only wished the original was included on disc 1.  Sick and Tired [Jason Nevins Funkrock Remix Edit] & Jason Nevins Electrochill Remix Edit are also good remixes, though I believe the Jason Nevins Electrochill Remix Edit is the better version.  Lastly I like Boom [Thunderpuss Tribe-A-Pella Mix], which sounds close enough to the original.  The song from FIFA, which makes me wanna dance, whether to the original, or the remix.   <br />If it weren't for the book case & the album leaving off Boom & Love is a Crime from disc 1, I'd give the album 5 stars.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I probably won't get too many \\"yes\\" vote on this review but I thought Happy Feet was Al Gore type of environmentalist movie aim toward children. The movie's animation was cute, songs were nice and story of Mumbles trying to find himself with his tap dancing have all the virtues of a good children film. Voice acting proves to be superbly well done and I had to admit, Mumbles do look like a cute animated version of Elijah Woods (our favorite hobbit).<br /><br />However, disguised in this children movie is strong environmental message about global warming, anti-fishing and that only penguins that can dance is worthy of saving, not to say the movie indirectly slapped at values of tradition, religion and zoos. What Happy Feet seem to me is a political message movie disguised as a \\"feel good\\" children movie.<br /><br />The DVD of Happy Feet proves to be pristine and near perfect in image and quality. The sound track is clear and aggressive and there are enough extras to keep most kids happy for a while.<br /><br />This movie beat out Disney's Cars for Best Animation but that award appears to be politically inspired by Hollywood. Yes, this is not a very happy review but I really don't like political action movie disguised as chldren movie

Pay no attention to the trolls who give this one star, they are just trying to promote blu-ray and have most likely not even seen this movie on HD-DVD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|From the opening scene to the final roll of the credits, Cars was a delight for me and my whole family. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship. <br /> <br />Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track. <br /> <br />The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles. <br /> <br />I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour. I'm not completely crazy.) <br /> <br />From my two-year-old on up, everyone in my family enjoyed Cars, and I actually came to like Owen Wilson as well.

B000LC55F2|5.0|There are many reviews here that have so eloquently explained why this film is a must-see, but I have to share my enthusiasm nevertheless.  The Prestige is a dark and intense gothic thriller set during the turn of the twentieth century and it tells the story of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two struggling magicians who turn against each other after a magic trick goes wrong, costing the life of Angier's wife.  Angry, Angier tries every way to outdo Borden in magic tricks and fame.  His motive is revenge at first, but then it takes a life of its own when discovering Borden's secrets and tricks become an obsession.  There are many twists throughout the film, which include some rather flooring scenes.<br /><br />I loved this film and its dark tone from beginning to end.  It isn't the typical thriller by any means, for it's got substance mostly brought on by the excellent direction of Christopher Nolan and the magnificent performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine.  Christian Bale is by far the best in this film.  He brings Borden's many complexities to life and he does leave you puzzled with his behavioral changes and hard-to-figure-out personality.  His performance floored me.  I've never seen this actor in a film before, and in addition to his good looks and gorgeous Welsh accent, I enjoyed his delivery and I look forward to watching him in other films.  Jackman surprised me here.  I'd seen him in romantic comedies and in those Van Helsing and X-Men movies and thought that was all he was capable of doing, but his stellar performance here has proven me wrong.  Plus, he looks gorgeous.  I cannot resist a tall, dark and handsome man in a cravat.  There are other fine performances here, one of them by David Bowie, who plays the legendary Victorian scientist Nikola Tesla.  The weakest link, acting-wise, is Scarlett Johansson, who uses one of the worst imitations of an English accent I've ever heard.  As for other aspects, the characterization Angier, Borden and the others is flawless.  The majority of the characters, namely the protagonists, are not meant to be sympathetic.  In fact, they are flawed, unlikeable people who are selfish and sinister in more ways than one.  (Though I admit I felt bad for Angier because he was so tortured and corrupted with obsession that I truly felt for the character.) That is what makes this film dark in a rather unique way. I love the cinematography, the late 19th Century England setting, and the overall dark plot.  This, as I and others have already said, is a must-see.  I watched this on iTunes and bought the DVD afterwards because I couldn't get enough and because this is the sort of movie you have to watch a few times in order to fully understand it.  I've watched it twice already and discovered things I hadn't noticed at first.  I wish I had read the book this film is based on before watching the movie.  Ah, well.  Anyway, this is highly recommended.ts, the characterization Angier, Borden and the others is flawless.  The majority of the characters, namely the protagonists, are not meant to be sympathetic.

0307346609|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't sure what to make of World War Z when I first heard about it.  I'm not a zombie fanatic, but I decided to give it a try and am very glad that I did.  The author cleverly uses the fictional war against zombies as the catalyst to hold up a mirror to human reactions in all kinds of situations.  You'll see ignorance, greed, fear, heroism, intelligence, and more all on display from the characters in the book.  He displays a broad gamut of human behavior under stress and I found his portrayals to be highly plausible given the kind of apocalypse that confronts mankind. <br /> <br />Some people will be drawn to this book solely because it is about a zombie attack.  Others will be put off for the same reason.  I would suggest that you set aside the zombie factor in deciding if this is a book that might interest you.  World War Z essentially dissects individual and societal reactions to war and highly stressful situations.  The author chose zombies as the catalyst but he could have just easily conjured up a different cause for \\"the end of the world as we know it\\" and told a similar story. <br /> <br />The book is very well written and the author displays a knowledge of many cultures and countries that I found fairly impressive.  I would recommend it to anyone who can set aside the fact that zombies don't exist and just go with the premise for what it is.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I admit, I had to see The Departed twice to truly get it, even though I lived in Boston for thirty years and know quite well the story on whom the movie is based. I'm not a Scorsese fan. I'll watch his movies, but I don't go out of my way to catch them. The only reason I made a point to see The Departed is because of Boston boy Mark Wahlberg. <br /> <br />That kid has grown into his own as an actor, as evidenced by his Oscar nods for Boogie Nights and The Departed. Against the usual suspects, Martin Sheen, Leonardo DiCaprio and Alec Baldwin, Wahlberg more than holds his own. In fact, he practically makes them look like furniture. <br /> <br />Just as co-star Matt Damon is a Boston local, so is Wahlberg. Both give very authentic Boston performances, and you'd have to be from Boston or have really spent serious time there to really appreciate that. <br /> <br />I saw the movie twice because it was a little hard to follow, at first. It's a long film, like Gangs of New York, but unlike Gangs of New York, it followed two sides of the same story concurrently. Once I knew the storyline I was free to watch the movie again and really get into the nuances of each actor's performance. <br /> <br />Martin Sheen makes it look so easy it's really quite embarrassing for him. Jack Nicholson has given us plently of fun crazy, devilish crazy and plain crazy crazy to enjoy through the years, but this is the first role I've seen him in where he's so frightenly and irredeemable criminal crazy that he's scarier than most horror film monsters. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio is beginning to show skills that I never would have guessed he had. This man has come a long way from the doomed, dewy-faced boy in Titanic. He's become what we've seen so little of in Hollywood these days: a real actor. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise is always Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, Will Smith is always Will Smith, but Leonardo DiCaprio slips into the very skin and spirit of whomever he's portraying. Forrest Whitaker does the same thing, as does Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br />The movie had the requisite bloodshed for a Scorsese film, but The Departed ventured into another dimension beyond Scorsese's past films. The raw intensity of the psychological gamesmanship going on made this one of the tautest, most exhausting films I've ever seen. <br /> <br />I was surprised by the manner of diCaprio's character's end, not by the end itself, as it had been foreshadowed throughout the movie. Damon's character's final meeting with Wahlberg's was a complete surprise that left me feeling a guilty satisfaction that really forced me to examine my own soul. <br /> <br />This is the first of Scorsese's films that made think about more than just what I was seeing onscreen, which is the job of an Academy-Award winning filmmaker. <br />
1853751960|5.0|I read this book many moons ago but it is still the most powerful book I have read in terms of getting your message out, whether in print, tv and now internet.  Ogilvy wrote this book long before the internet, but the principles he uses for print apply to the internet.  I have used the principles in my web design company, AUDIN Web Design, with amazing results.  People love my designs and the formula is so simple:<br /><br />The one thing that stood out in my mind was: Picture, Headline, Copy; in that order.  That's the formula that works for web design.  Don't forget it!  It will change your life and make the world a better place, seriously.<br /><br />I use that principle in my designs and it's visually appealing and I am able to get high rankings on the search engines, because of the design principles Ogilvy espoused some 40 years ago..  Although, I think about this book all the time, I haven't picked it up in over ten years.  Now, that I am writing this review, I will dust it off and give it another read.

B000LE1FAY|4.0|I'm sure I'm not alone in wishing that Belinda Carlisle's newest album was. in fact, a new one from her part-time band, the Go-Go's. 2001's GOD BLESS THE GO-GO'S hinted at some great things to come, and I think that most of us are hoping that the group's statements that they probably won't ever record again are ify at best. So a solo record it is! But to record her first one in over a decade entirely in French?!? Well, guess what?? It works!! Carlisle's accent is spot-on around 75% of the time, and VOILA has an overall groove that's easy-going and relaxed (I actually found it particularly enjoyable in the car!). Things kick off with the mesmerizing \\"Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp.\\" Backed by an arrangement that is equal parts earthy and magical, Carlisle delivers a lead vocal that is both sultry and sublime. Captivatingly charming, it's a great way to open the disc! Next up is the whimsical, albeit brilliant, \\"Bonnie et Clyde.\\" In 25+ years of recording, Carlisle has rarely sounded sexier, and she TOTALLY makes the song her own! Twinkling guitars mixed with electronic beats add a modern, yet classic, feel. Tres bien! \\"Avec le Temps\\" is a tad bit over the top and melodramatic....the strings come across as sappy, and Carlisle's vocal is mannered and forced. Maybe that kind of drama is the type of feeling they were going for, but this cut leaves me cold! Far superior is \\"Sous le Ciel de Paris\\"....there's something that's absolutely intoxicating about the track! It's almost like you're transported to some countryside pub, where the good-natured (and slightly inebriated!) patrons would join in for a rousing chorus or two, joyfully supporting Carlisle, who's in excellent voice throughout! Another gem! There's a sweetness to \\"Des Ronds Dans L'eau\\" that is simple, supple and straightforward. Carlisle's vocal dips and soars, whisperingly confidential one minute, achingly yearning the next. I really wish that they had included an English version of this song as well - it's a natural for Carlisle in any language! That said, my favorite track on VOILA has got to be \\"Pourtant Tu M'aimes.\\" Yes, it's the closest thing to a Go-Go song, but it's also much, much more. With it's hard-edged rock vibe, kittenish lead vocal and sparkling keyboards, this cut adds a whole other dimension to the disc. It's cool, contemporary and fun, and (dare I say it!) the only track that stands any kind of chance of getting any airplay here in the States (The English version is just as good!). I could actually see this song added to any future Go-Go's set list, maybe sung in both English and French! Love, love, LOVE this song! \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" isn't QUITE as melodramatic and over-blown as \\"Avec le Temps\\", but the song does prove too big for Carlisle, with the vocal totally controlling her instead of the other way around. \\"La Vie en Rose\\" is another cut that only partially connects. True, this song has been recorded so many times that you would have to think of something new to really keep it fresh. Then there's the Edith Piaf factor (a totally definitive recording!). With all that taken into consideration, do we REALLY need another dance version of a classic song?!? Carlisle's vocal is full-bodied and sensual, but the arrangement is slightly stale, resulting in a rather dated vibe. Faring much better is \\"Contact.\\" With it's futuristic groove, clean, cool arrangement and steely lead vocal, there's a freah, modern feel to the song, but in no way does it ever sound trendy. Carlisle really steps out of the box here, totally bypassing her (usually) perky comfort zone, and it pays off in spades. VERY nice! I also really dig \\"Merci Cherie\\" - with it's slightly militaristic beat and soulful, heartfelt vocal, it has a lot in common with the Go-Go's \\"Mercenary.\\" In fact, Carlisle's vocal has the same sad, wistful, yet wise, phrasing as on that earlier track, resulting in a delivery that is right on the money! \\"Jezebel\\" closes things on an odd, albeit fun, note. Picture every spaghetti Western you've ever seen/heard mixed with a massive dose of flemenco. Toss in BC's most divaesque vocal to date and you have \\"Jezebel!\\" Funny thing is, it totally works, wrapping things up on a fun, energetic high! As for the four English versions included on the bonus disc, \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" and \\"I Still Love Him\\" are hits in any language, while \\"La Vie En Rose\\" is OK. Only \\"If You Go Away\\" falls flat. That said, VOILA may not be the album most Go-Go's fans were waiting for, but it certainly was a daring choice for Belinda Carlisle to make after putting her solo career on hold for a decade. In the end, though, the disc works, and it's a welcomed addition to her musical legacy (As with all my reviews, I have to dock the CD half a star for not including the lyrics...a CD booklet with both French and English lyrics would have been much preferred to the rather scary fold-out poster that's included. I mean, c'mon, B......time to cut back on the botox!!)ghetti Western you've ever seen/heard mixed with a massive dose of flemenco.

B00005JPCF|3.0|My children and I were not pleased with Happy Feet. What was hyped as a fun family frolic staring dancing penguins turned out to be a heavy-handed, ecologically-geared ambush teaching the lesson that if you're an endangered species, you'd better learn to entertain mankind with some clever footwork if you expect man to do its best to quit ruining the environment and save you.    As another reviewer pointed out, some of the song lyrics were not appropriate for younger viewers. The film opens with a female penguin, voiced by Nicole Kidman, singing Prince's \\"Kiss.\\"    There were some absolutely adorable parts, however. (You can't hate the penguins. They're just too cute.) When one of the young penguins busts loose with Grandmaster Flash, I laughed out loud all the way to my toes.    Brittany Murphy was especially wonderful as the voice of Gloria, the penguin Mumbles most wants to impress, and their rendition of Boogie Wonderland, with Mumble using his talented feet to tap out a heartsong, was one of the highlights of the film. Lovelace, as voiced by Robin Williams, was surprisingly dull.    My children and I were also taken aback by the mix of live actors with animation late in the film. This movie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I'd expected.
0887306667|5.0|As an online marketing professional for an internet web design company, I found this relatively old book to be quite useful in the online arena.  This book is a quick read much like their other books.  If you are a marketing professional, or an assistant to a marketing professional, or in school dreaming of becoming an assistant to a marketing professional, or just now applying to schools to study to be an assistant to a marketing professional, then this book would prove to be invaluable.  As with many of their books, it's a quick read and you almost wonder why you spent the money.  I suggest you get it used or combined with some kind of deal.  Although it is an excellent book, it's not the type of book you have to get right away.  Wait until there is some kind of sale, or super saver discount, or \\"borrow\\" it from your neighborhood library.

Apparently, it's still there, because no deleted scenes made it to the DVD.

0066620996|5.0|This is a great book for anyone wanting to learn about concepts of leadership and business.  This book is a must read for anyone in corporate America.  It's a very easy read and definitely not boring. Jim's website is a great second resource to the book: [...].     The book analyzes easy to understand real life examples to teach you about business and culture. The book is well laid out and explains the Good To Great process very clear. The main points of the book are:    1. Level 5 Leadership- Level 5 leaders are self-effacing, quiet, reserved, shy and have a blend of personal humility and professional will. They are ambitious for the company and what it stands for.  2. First Who, Then What- Get the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus and the right people in the right seats. Promote from within when you have the right people on the bus, this reinforces the core values.  3. Confront the Brutal Facts- Embrace the brutal facts of your current reality and believe that no matter what you will prevail in the end. Brutal facts clarify what must be done to stimulate progress.  4. Hedgehog Concept- If you can't be the best in the world at your core business, then it can't be the basis of a great company. Have a deep understanding and incredible simplicity. Great BHAGs sit in the middle of your three circles. (BHAG: Big Hairy Audacious Goal.)  5. Culture of Discipline- With a culture of discipline, you don't need hierarchy, you don't need bureaucracy, don't need excessive controls. Eject those who do not share values and standards of the organization.   6. Technology Accelerators.  Don't use technology as the primary means of igniting a transformation in the company. Shun technology fads and pioneer the application of technology. Use as momentum toward achievement of BHAG.  7. Flywheel and Doom Loop- Those who launch revolutions, dramatic change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail. Create sustainable momentum that doesn't dependon presence of a charismatic visionary to motivate people.  8. Good to Great to Built to Last- Producing sustained results. Creating an enduring great company of iconic stature.    Students or business persons looking to truly understand what it takes to be a successful leader must read this book. If you don't have time to read, grab the audio book and listen. Jim Collins is extremely dynamic and easy to listen to. You will gain a great perspective of leadership after reading this book.

1569242739|5.0|I thought that once I became a vegan, cakes (and cupcakes) would be a thing of the past.  I mean, who could possibly make a decent cake without eggs?!?  But I tried Isa Chandra's carrot cake recipe in her VWaV cookbook and had rave reviews.  Hmmm...should I dare the cupcakes? <br /> <br />OK, I dared. <br /> <br />I started with the chocolate cupcakes, because, well, that's my favorite cupcake and if that recipe didn't cut it, then none of them would.  Is that too harsh?  I don't think so (but I apologize if I have offended your sensibilities).  I decided to splurge (since it is my birth month) and make the coconut pecan topping to go on top. <br /> <br />My husband and I just ate some - actually, two each!  We proclaim that we have just died and gone to vegan cupcake heaven.  The cake crumb was tender, with just the right amount of airiness and denseness (not to mention  very yummy).  The coconut topping could have stood a few more pecans (next time I'll increase it to 3/4 cup) and a tad bit less coconut, but it was also very easy to make and scrumptious. <br /> <br />I can't wait to try the next flavor. <br /> <br />To respond to a previous reviewer's comments - are these healthy (i.e., can I eat them daily and not gain weight)?  Well, no, they are cupcakes!  Indulgences!  They have no animal products, but they are not fat free, low-fat, or artificial. Enjoy in moderation.  Or not ;-)
B000NQR7NO|5.0|oh i just can't wait for this album to come out the only thing I'm mad about is they changed the release date of the single brainstorm it was coming out on my birthday and now it is the day after. But any way i can't wait to hear it. I hope it is every bit as good as there last album!
B00005JKG5|4.0|If you like music, dance, and romance, I'm sure you will like this movie.  It won a couple of Oscars for best original score and best original song.  Jennifer Beals was also nominated as best actress.  I very much enjoyed the dance scenes and music.  As a matter of fact I watched the final dance scene over and over.  Last but not least, the plot holds your interest.  It emphasizes following your dreams and never giving up.  Great flick!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|When this appeared on Masterpiece Theatre, I couldn't stop watching it over and over.  Truly captivating scenery, emotion, and suspense--even though I have read the original story many times over!  Jane seems very real in this version, not simply a symbol of purity and grace--I felt for her and trusted her.  Of course, Toby Stephens as Rochester made my heart race!  Do whatever you must to see this!
B000LE1GVW|4.0|It's a pleasure to walk \\"These Streets\\". I bought this album on a whim. I was walking through Target and saw the CD and picked it up. I had heard of him a few months prior while reading a magazine. So, I saw his CD and figured I'd give him a try. That was a very wise choice. The best songs are... <br />Jenny Don't Be Hasty <br />Last Request <br />Rewind <br />New Shoes <br />Loving You <br />Autumn <br /> <br />Overall the whole album is great. His voice is super sexy and raspy. The music is catchy and emotional. Also, his lyrics are very deep for someone only 19 years old. If you like good music by people who actually have talent, spend the 10 dollars and buy his CD. You won't regret it.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|And in case you don't know what that means, it means pro-free market economy, other-wise known as capitalism (and not the mixed economy, feudalism, or mercantilism that leftist typically mistenterpret as laissez-faire capitalism).  Capitalism however is a term created by Karl Marx, who ridiculously believed that the benefits of free-enterprise only go towards the rich. <br />   Some idiots have already rung in with ridiculous assessments, such as one who claims that according to this movie, money is happiness, but if that's the case, then why didn't Chris Gardner abandon his son, since according to the reviewer, he would have been happier that way.  Happiness is a subjective thing.  Part of the reason Chris Gardner pursued the job of a stock-broker is so that he could create a better life for his son.  By far the most idiotic claim comes from toddo however who says: <br /> <br />\\"The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes. Don't fall for it!\\" <br /> <br />Does toddo believe that the pursuit of misery, suffering, death, and destruction, are the real,  true values that are society should pursue instead.  Did you, toddo, cry not out of happiness but sadness when the Berlin Wall fell or when you heard that Pol Pot had been slain.  Let us all return to the Dark Ages while we're at it.  Or does toddo believe that otherss subjective happiness is not his subjective happiness and therefore that they must be wrong. <br />     The movie itself is heart-warming and slightly funny at times.  Chris Gardner is a  member of the proletariat, working hard to pull himself up out of poverty.  He is hardly some greedy, shallow, materialistic, monster, but rather a hard-working man who uses his head, pays attention to and acts on opportunities, and even makes a big risk at one point, which at first flops but creates something useful when he follows up on it.  It also portrays a big successful businessman whom he meets as an extraordinarily friendly businessman and kindly father himself.  Chris Gardner goes through hell, at one point even sleeping with his son in the bathroom of a subway restroom, crying as his son is asleep with someone knocking on the door.  Then don't reveal much about what happened when he got the job, which is its one drawback, but still the facial expression employed by Will Smith at the made me completely forget that this guy played a goofball from Phillly on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Well-done overall.

B000N6U0E2|2.0|Will Smith is the main reason I went to see this film.  He stars as Chris Gardner.  Back in 1981, his life was hard.  His girlfriend/wife (I've heard both, and the movie never makes it clear) is working double shifts to support the two of them and their son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  Chris, meanwhile, is working as hard has he can to sell bone density machines.  He's already bought them, so he needs to sell them to get his life savings back.<br /><br />One day, he happens to meet a successful stock broker.  Chris is fascinated by the wealth this guy has, so he begins to pursue it as a new career, not knowing all the stress that is involved.  He learns of an internship offered by Dean Witter, and tries to get into the program despite his lack of formal education.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his life is going downhill.  His landlord is tired of waiting for the rent and his wife decides to leave for New York.  Can he balance being a single dad with a spot in this competitive internship?<br /><br />The first strike against the movie is the trailer.  That's right.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen this movie.  I half expected that when I went to see it, so that's not my main complaint.<br /><br />I went to the film expecting an inspiring true story.  I got a true story.  While the theme \\"If you work hard, you can accomplish anything\\" does come out, the movie focuses on all the struggles.  It got depressing long before the end with very little to balance it out.<br /><br />And, of course, there are Chris's actions.  While I did spend most of the film rooting for him to succeed, there were times it was hard.  He risked too much since he had to care for his son.  And he didn't seem to be able to keep track of his machines either.<br /><br />What I can't fault is Will Smith's performance.  He is a powerful actor who does an excellent job bringing Chris to life.  Jaden Smith does a decent job playing the son, he good but certainly not the next big child star.  Their bond was touching and provided some of the lighter moments.<br /><br />I really had looked forward to this movie, but in the end was highly disappointed.heir bond was touching and provided some of the lighter moments. <br /> <br />I really had looked forward to this movie, but in the end was highly disappointed.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|When talking about westerns you couldn't begin to muster a word without first mentioning Clint Eastwood. Eastwood didn't start the most popular genre in American cinema but he helped to romanticize the idea of a gunslinger with a heart of stone to people the world over with his \\"man with no name\\" series directed by Sergio Leoni.  My personal favorites of all the spaghetti westerns were his.  He continued this tradition when he stared directing westerns of his own like High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, and the Outlaw Josie Wales to name a few.  He began to come into his own as not just an actor on screen but as a storyteller to.<br /><br />The Unforgiven is Eastwood at his peak as a storyteller and his first real master piece as a director.  He sheds his badass, no fear, bent on revenge gunslinger persona that he made famous behind for a character with more depth.  A man with more demons and layers upon layers of baggage, fears and insecurities.  In this film Eastwood Plays William Muddy, an ex outlaw turned family man and pig farmer from Missouri.  William has a bit of a past that he has long left behind, mayhem, gambling, boozin' and of course killing folks.  His long dead wife cured him of those evils and he is just a simple yet inept farmer.  William has two youngins that he is struggling to provide for when a young gunslinger wanna be comes riding in, looking to team up with Muddy, to collect on a reward offered by a whore who was disfigured by two cowboys.<br /><br />Muddy who is flat broke with children to tend to feels he has no choice and agrees to help find and kill these men but only if he can also team up with his old partner, Ned (Morgan Freeman). The three men soon find out this bounty has many more obstacles to over come besides just finding and killing these men.  The biggest being the Sheriff of Old Whiskey, Little Bill (Gene Hackman). Little Bill keep a tight hold on what goes on in his town and outlaws all fire arms in city limits.  He has little respect for assassins and hired guns and enforces his law with the most brutal of measures.<br /><br />The thing that makes this film so different that the other Eastwood films is the depth of the characters, mainly Muddy played by Eastwood himself.  In the beginning he is old, out of shape and soft spoken farmer who hasn't even held a pistol in a decade.  He has lost all taste for killing and wants to leave the past where it belongs, in the past.  Muddy is not only regretful and ashamed of  his past but has become fearful of it as well.  On the servace he almost looks like a coward... but no, he's no coward.  Muddy is afraid of letting out the monster he was in his youth, knowing full well there is no turning back, if your gonna kill someone you have to be all in or all out.  His partners learn this the hard way when you set to kill a man, a bit your own soul dies with it.<br /><br />The progression and transformation this character takes is amazing done and explodes in the films climax.  Eastwood took a huge chance gracing the film for an hour and a half before ever giving what the true fans want.  When Eastwood finally delivers with the goods its well worth the wait and you find out that he is meaner, nastier than you could have ever dreamed. This film has superb directing, writing, acting and pacing, nothing in this movie is off in the slightest and each character is more fleshed out and deep than any other western that I've ever seen.<br /><br />This movie is about more than just badass gunslingers, this movie has a message about what killing does to a man and how few people have the stomach for it.  Even the badest of them all is kept awake at night from the horrors he's inflicted on others.<br /><br />You will not find a better modern day western.  Even if you're not a fan of this genre you will enjoy this film immensely and walk away feeling satisfied.<br /><br />The title of this move sums up Eastwood character to a tee...Unforgiven.  Not just by others but himself as well.  You can change yourself all you want but something you do in life will follow you and haunt you for the rest of your days. One of the best lines of Eastwood's in the movie that really sums up what it's about is when the kid said that they had it comin' to `em, and Eastwoon responds, \\"We All have it comin' kid.\\"by others but himself as well.

B000002AS3|5.0|In the history of rock n' roll*, there probably aren't 20 better albums than Definitely Maybe.  Oasis, under pressure to throw together enough material for a full album after signing with Creation Records on the strength of a handful of songs, accidentally made one of the best albums ever.  It's not hyperbole to say that every song on this album is damned good, if not great.<br /><br />Oasis has always been accused of being derivative, and there's alot of evidence of that on Definitely Maybe.  \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" is T-Rex's \\"Bang A Gong (Get it On)\\" retooled.  The chorus of \\"Shakermaker\\" is lifted directly from the Coca-Cola song, \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.\\"  Yet, the album is fresh.  Liam Gallagher's vocals are fantastic; he's a one-of-a-kind singer.  The guitars are big and loud.  Swagger just drips from every song.  Whatever their sources of inspiration, the Gallaghers have always put their own stamp on their songs, made their own sounds.  Paradoxically derivative and unique, Definitely Maybe was so groundbreaking that bands have been trying for the last decade to capture its sound, its magic.  There's a lot of Definitely in both of Jet's albums, for example.<br /><br />This is a must-have album for any rock fan.  Like Revolver, Kick (INXS), Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby (just a few examples off-the-cuff), Definitely Maybe captured the spirit of the time in which it was released and sent rock in a different direction.  What \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" were to the British Invasion, the Definitely Maybe album was to the \\"Brit Pop\\" movement.<br /><br />If you're a rock n' roll fan and this album hasn't found its way into your collection, you've really been missing out.  Order it today.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would!<br /><br />*By \\"rock 'n roll\\" I mean straigh-forward, guitar-driven music.  I don't mean to include soul, R & B, hip-hop, \\"soft rock\\" or other styles that sometimes get lumped in the \\"rock 'n roll\\" category.roll\\" category.

B000MTDRKE|4.0|Being a Lutheran, this was an anticipated release by NM (The story of course built around the reformation of the church by Martin Luther). In short, this is an enjoyable listen. This is not what I call true progressive metal/rock, don't make the mistake of thinking so. I was a little misled when I heard Paul Gilbert (Guitar Shredder Great - Racer X) would be the guitarist on this release. He does play a great solo on one song, then another complete song, and finishes with an acoustic intro for yet another... but that is it. Neal Morse's guitar work isn't bad, but he's no PG. Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater is on the drums and does his usual fantastic work. <br /> Like I mentioned, don't buy this expecting Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Symphony X or anything like it. It is more an ongoing softer Prog, not as complex, like Yes, Kansas and the like.  <br /> If you do enjoy talented musicianship and would like to hear a true story of one of the most important men alive since the apostles, then you will make a GREAT purchase. <br /> <br />T Moore
B000002B1M|5.0|After dropping his certified classic Illmatic, Nas loses a dear friend(Ill Will RIP) but decides to move on and make another album. If you thought that Nas was not going to be able to give you another solid album just because of Ill Will's death guess again! Nas rhymes are just as great as they were on Illmatic. Standout Tracks:THE MESSAGE, STREET DREAMS, I GAVE YOU POWER(Creative track where Nas tells the story about being a gun), WATCH DEM N***AS, TAKE IT IN BLOOD, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, THE SET UP(another dope track supplied by Havoc who hasnt been slacking on production yet), BLACK GIRL LOST, SUSPECT AND LIVE N***A RAP(crazy production crazy, crazy combo). Filler: Nas Is Coming is boring. He might have been the first Eastcoaster to make a track with Dre but the song is still wack. Bottom Line: Nas second LP is still a great album that should not be forgotten. Nas shows growth on here(as he does on his other albums) while giving you hot rhymes over scorching hot production. Worth collecting
B0009A1AS2|4.0|When I first ordered this, I was expecting \\"Train of Though\\" (the album previous to this one).  That isn't what I got.  Biased by this, I didn't really like the album at first, until I really started to listen to it.  It really is a good CD, but it just isn't as heavy as I was expecting.<br /><br />The first song, \\"The Root of All Evil,\\" is heavy, has good lyrics...it was exactly what I would want from a Dream Theater song.<br /><br />The second track, \\"The Answer Lies Within,\\" is really a calm sort of song, and I usually skip it.  It isn't a horrable song by any means, I just find it kind of boring.<br /><br />The third song is one of my favorites. \\"These Walls\\" has some really nice drum work that is constantly moving, even when the rest of the instruments are silent.<br /><br />\\"I Walk Beside You\\" seems to be the album's token \\"happy song.\\"  Oddly enough, it's got some nice guitar work, and I actually really like it.<br /><br />\\"Never Enough\\" is a sort of dark song, and is one I had trouble getting into at first.  I actually like it quite a bit, though.<br /><br />The seventh song, \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" deals with some things around 9/11.<br /><br />I hate it when country artists do this, and even though Dream Theater isn't using the tragedy to promote their music like country artists tend to, I have a bit of a bias against this song.  It's not bad in all reality.<br /><br />The final song on the CD, being over 20 minutes long, takes some patience to listen to all the way through.  I've only ever done it once, and I was busy doing something else at the time.  It didn't seem that bad, but it does take quite a while for the actual song to start up.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a good CD, but I enjoyed \\"Train of Though\\" quite a bit more.  If you don't already have that one, you should probably get it first.
B000065VB0|5.0|I love Intruder, my favorite track.  One of my favorite early Peter Gabriel Albums.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This CD simply blew me away the first time I heard it.  While looking for guitar lessons on Google Video, I found Petrucci's \\"Rock Dicipline\\" series.  Before I could take it seriously, I had to see what the man was capable of.  I looked him up on Wikipedia to find him associated with the band Dream Theater.  In their discography, \\"Train of Thought\\" was labeled as their heaviest album at the time, so I decied to give it a listen.  That's when I got sucked into the whirlpool and have become unable to stop listening to their music.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"As I Am,\\" the first song by them I heard.  I noticed the strange time signatures almost right away, and I was amazed by how they kept in time, even though I was unable to count it.  This song roped me in and I had to hear more.<br /><br />The second song, \\"This Dying Soul,\\" is as amazing as the first.  The lyrics drove in the idea of someone really struggling with their life, and realizing they must change in order to remain alive.<br /><br />\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" starts off as the exact opposite of the first two songs.  It begins very soft, with sad lyrics, but soon enough the song picks up and becomes as driving as the ones before it.  This song also features some of the weirdest keyboard soloing I've heard. Ever.<br /><br />The name \\"Honor Thy Father\\" made me think this song was going to have some sort of religious message/twist, but this was not the case.  The song starts off with and awesome drum fill, and heavy riffs, which don't stop until the song is over. Nice.<br /><br />Song five, \\"Vacant,\\" merely serves as a soft intro to the instrumental, \\"Stream of Consiousness,\\" after which only one thing can be said: \\"Wow, that was awesome!!\\"<br /><br />The final track, \\"In the Name of God,\\" once again sounded like it was going to have some deep religious message, but this time it actually did.  The lyrics to this song are my favorite part, though everything else about it is equally great.<br /><br />If you don't have this album, you'd better get it.  Now.  Well, maybe you shouldn't, or your friends may get annoyed because you won't be able to talk about anything else.  Meh, who needs friends when you have this CD? ^_^<br />If you don't have this album, you'd better get it.  Now.

B0000009S3|5.0|I am not a huge fan of zappa's music, but I am a huge fan of this album. Nothing else he did ever came close to matching the emotional and intense genius of this music. \\"Peaches en regalia,\\" the opening track, is a splendid, catchy instrumental, that's goofy and pure fun. Then comes \\"Willie The Pimp,\\" an intense rock and roll song with frenzied, possessed vocals by Captain Beefheart. It's the only song on the album with vocals: nine minutes and sixteen seconds of mayhem with a great guitar jam that is pure power. \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\" is a piece of music that wouldn't sound out of place on any fine prog-rock album from the era. Divine and accomplished, an excellent  display of  zappa's composition talents .  For me, the best piece on the album, though, is the epic avant-garde jazz fusion freakout called \\"the gumbo variations.\\" this is roughly seventeen minutes of wild and inspired playing. A fella named Ian Underwood is the star of the show here, blowing his heart out on saxophone and clarinet in a pure state of emotional frenzy. This great track brings to mind one of my favorite albums of this era, Soft Machine's masterpiece, simply called \\"Third.\\" \\"The gumbo variations,\\" would fit right in on that classic Soft Machine album. As I said, I am not the biggest fan of zappa's music in general, but boy do I love this album. \\"Hot Rats\\" is a classic that sounds as fresh today as it did when I first heard it in the late seventies. Do yourself a favor and discover this vital music. <br />
B0002VKZTI|3.0|It probably depends on where you came aboard as a fan of Eumir Deodato as to how you view his post mid-70s work. I came aboard with Deodato 2 to which I was introduced by a friend heavily into jazz. I had ignored his music previously because I found the 2001 Space Odyssey theme played to death on the radio to be too commercial for my taste. But after hearing Deodato 2 in the mid-70s, I sought out other Deodato recordings new and old. <br />I bought Love Island back when it was first issued and although there were some very nice pieces on it, I felt even then as I do now that it marks the point where Deodato is starting to slip into the pit of shamelessly pandering musical twaddle that Night Cruiser and Knights of Fantasy exemplify. Exhibit A is the execrable Whistle Bump which is brutally reminiscent of that awful disco song, The Hustle. <br />So what do I like about Love Island? Well, to start there is the opening cut Area Code 808 which, while redolent of disco/funk, contains some excellent guitar work by Larry Carlton and George Parrish Jr. Then there is the title cut that while oh so smooth and dreamy, contains some memorable passages that feature George Benson and Larry Carlton. Chariot of the Gods is also an excellent piece which features John Tropea, a frequent Deodato sideman, on guitar. Then I just can't help but love the arrangement and the excellent cover of the classic Take The \\"A\\" Train. <br />If you are a long-time Deodato buff, you will notice that while Whistle Bump points to Deodato's future as a David Hasselhoff wannabe (look at the album cover of Night Rider), that Pina Colada nods to some of the funk/fusion that he sometimes indulged in earlier years. <br />So I view Love Island as a watershed album. The disco outings begin to chase off old fans yet they bring a new set of fans on board. So if you are new to Deodato and your tastes lean toward jazz, get this yes but stay away from his later work. In fact, I recommend you go all the way back to his work that was issued in Brazil before anyone here in the States knew who he was! But, if you prefer the fusion/funk style, then get this and maybe a couple of his earlier US issues but definitely go for more of his post-Love Island work. <br />By my comments, the reader knows which way I lean. I would give Love Island 3 and 1/2 stars if possible, but since its not and doesn't deserve 4 stars, I will have to tag it with three. Its good, but certainly not essential.
B00005A0RI|5.0|last month i experienced some horror in my life that was worthy of a stephen king novel. i wanted to listen to charlie haden's sublime album \\"nocturne,\\" and i couldn't find it! it was not there where it should be amongst my other charlie haden cds! fear overtook me at once and i began turning the house upside down in my frantic search for this gem. nowhere was it to be found. my heart raced and beads of sweat formed on my forehead. i felt sick. well, amazon.com came to my rescue. i jumped online and ordered me another copy pronto. and now i have this gorgeous recording back in my home. seriously, i have over 700 jazz albums, and this one is in my top 25. like the miles davis slice of heaven \\"kind of blue,\\" this charlie haden album is perfect. every second. every note. perfect and beautiful. gonazlo rubalcaba's piano work is stunning, as is the saxophone work of joe lovano and david sanchez. federico ruiz violin playing adds another great dimension here. and, of course, mr haden's bass is sublime, as always. cuban jazz for late nights, this is quiet, contemplative music at its best. may you find yourself a copy and never misplace it. i'm sure my original copy will turn up someday beneath a butter dish or amongst the dog's toy chest. that'll be great. then i will have two copies. as long as i never have to go through another day of life without this near at hand for when the mood is right! <br />

B00006AW2L|4.0|\\"Aftermath,\\" was the stones first album of all original material, and it has a vibe that's a bit different from their previous recordings. Brian Jones plays a mean sitar on the great opening track, \\"paint it, black,\\" which is a classic piece of psychedelic rock. \\"Lady Jane,\\" is a divine acoustic ballad, with a heavy english folk sound about it (trivia bit: on neil young's masterpiece \\"tonight's the night\\" he sings a song about borrowing a tune from the rolling stones for one of his songs, because he's too wasted to come up with his own tune. The melody which he borrowed  from the stones for that tune is the melody from \\"Lady Jane.\\").  The blues, as always, are a big part of the stones sound. \\"Doncha bother me,\\" boasts a fine display of slide guitar wizardry, and \\"High and Dry,\\" is an excellent acoustic blues piece with a strong sense of melody. \\"It's not easy,\\" is another standout, with its splendid rhythmic drive. All in all, another fine outting from the stones which i highly recommend. <br />
B000084T18|4.0|I felt I had to revisit this album. It's been nearly four years since 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' dropped. At the time of its release, the majority of hip-hop heads, whether they like to admit it or not, were listening to 50's words as if they were the gospel. Most emcees who make their names off of mixtapes rarely blow, but 50 Cent managed to debut in a way that almost seems impossible four years later; over five million records sold in the United States alone. At the time of GRODT's release, G-Unit wasn't the million-dollar corporation it is today; it was a movement.     What's gone wrong since then, though? G-Unit DID oversaturate the market between 2003 and 2005, but all of the releases found within that time were of considerabley high quality. However, once 50's sophomore effort, the Massacre hit, it seemed like G-Unit fell off in terms of quality. The Unit was never an exceptional crew; they were certainly no Wu-Tang, or Mobb Deep. They did release great music though, which many of their fans and haters today seem to forget. The main problem most people have with 50 Cent is the fact that he could never live up to the hype; he was billed as an emcee of Nas or Jay-Z's caliber, but was really just an average lyricist with a really tight flow. What made GRODT sound so epic is the fact that 50's syrupy vocals, and the VERY high-budget production values presented it as a revolutionary project, despite the fact that it was no more than a hot debut by a talented, albeit not magnificient emcee.    Going back four years to this release, it's unbelievable how much the game has changed since then; and honestly, it hasn't been for the better. While there's plenty of emcees in the mainstream still capable of carrying the commercial game, there's also many mundane artists that make you miss the era of G-Unit. 50 Cent has been replaced by the likes of Mims, and G-Unit's old followers have turned into, for the most part, Dipset groupies. Tracks like This Is Why I'm Hot and We Fly High, while catchy, will make you miss something such as In Da Club, no matter how overplayed it was. Also, the numerous Jay-Z and T.I. impersonators will have you at least appreciate that while he wasn't an amazing rapper, 50 Cent carried a style all his own.    50 Cent is returning this year with his third studio album(well, at least that will see an actual release), and his recent tracks have been a breath of fresh air, surprisingly, in a genre that consist of dozens of one-hit wonders all following the same exact formula. Looking at the album without a previous bias, GRODT is a phenomenal album musically, and remains one of the dopest releases of the new millenium. 50 Cent may consist of nothing more than cliches, but whether he lacks substance or not, the fact remains that he is a wonderful entertainer with more charisma left pinky than most rappers, past, present, and future, possess in their entire bodies. With the exception of the poorly produced Blood Hound(which features a then-unknown Young Buck), Get Rich or Die Tryin' boasts a large amount of dope tracks, with little to no filler. If you can't feel tracks like Patiently Waitin', In Da Club, If I Can't, or Back Down after all these years, then you're too closed-minded to even stop hating on 50.    Hopefully 50 Cent's upcoming album will be more GRODT, and less Massacre, because if it is, it'll be a strong contendor for hip-hop album of the year. It maybe uncool to like 50 Cent in 2007, with the G-Unot crusade and all, but Get Rich or Die Tryin' stands as a defining album in the new era of hip-hop.
B000000W5P|5.0|1978. the last great stones album. i happen to think (unlike many others) that they've done some very good stuff since then, but this is definitely the end of the line for greatness in their discography. \\"just my imagination,\\" \\"repectable,\\" \\"before they make me run,\\" which is about as good a thing as keith richards ever did, and \\"beast of burden\\" are all classics. mick jagger's voice is brimming with personality here (instead of falling into a caricature of himself, which sometimes has happened in these later years). keith and ron wood splatter the recording with great guitar licks. and every song is strong to great. a wonderful piece of rock and roll. come back, boys. dylan did it. you can too. i know that you can.

B000003N8R|5.0|i've been on a real coltrane binge of late, and have been filling in some holes in my collection of his stuff. what a hole i found from 1964! no wonder i have always felt a vague sense of dissatisfaction with life. now i know what was wrong all along. i didn't have this great coltrane masterpiece! well now i do, and i feel 100% on top of life's game. this album is a stunning piece of work, mostly mid-tempo to slow in vibe, coltrane here plays absolutely gorgeous sax, while mccoy tyner's wizardry on piano is inventive and wonderful for the ear to behold, as well. the rhythm section of jimmy garrison (bass) and elvin jones (drums) rumbles along beneath the surface like some swelling wave, carrying things to their conclusion with a haunting sublty and grace. the title track \\"crescent\\" is one of my all-time favorite trane tracks now, and the ballad \\"wise one\\" is close on its heels. the final cut \\"the drum thing\\" is an amazing piece, too. a composition where elvin jones' magic really stands out. no john coltrane collection is complete without this heavenly album. now i know.

B000FILW86|5.0|If it were ever possible for a rock band to supersede nearly 30 years of infectious melodies and rock anthems with one single album release, Cheap Trick would be the masterful culprits. Their June 2006 release, Rockford combines some of their most contagious riffs and vocal hooks with a matured complexity that comes from nearly three decades of writing and touring the world together. The ultimate result is 12 thoughtfully crafted pop rock gems that could very well blow this year's leading young rock band right off the radio and stage.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the World\\" kicks off Cheap Trick's latest release with a powerful message; talented and well-versed bands do indeed exist outside of the plasticized whine-pop groups that blanket today's rock radio airwaves. With this album and especially the opening song, Cheap Trick beckons you into their world:<br /><br />Doors are opened to ya / That's all we can do yeah  / Before then I knew ya / Rules are changing ooh yeah.<br /><br />\\"O Claire\\" sweetens the album midway through a series of hard-hitting and melodic anthems while \\"One More\\" weaves a bit of playful soul into the mix. Co-written and co-produced by Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes), \\"Perfect Stranger\\" is a bit less hooky than the other tracks, but still proves worthy enough to release as the album's first single.<br /><br />The CD packaging itself screams loudly with color and is adorned with cartoon caricatures of each member. Perhaps with the amount of respect and adoration this band has collected over the years, an artsy or thoughtful album art approach would be unnecessary at this point. It seems that Cheap Trick want to let everyone know the most important thing about playing rock music is to have fun and to not take yourself too seriously.  Also, the CD booklet is supplied with just album and song credits; printed song lyrics seem to be a dispensable commodity alongside such hooky and memorable tunes; they are easy to sing along with even after the first few listens.<br /><br />Rockford serves to remind the skeptical music fan that it is possible to produce an extremely rocking yet melodic record in this day and age without the angst and gripe that plague today's younger rock bands. Cheap Trick's precision and energy are not capsulated within the tweaking abilities of studio production, but in their perfected songwriting abilities and matured inventiveness. After nearly three decades of releasing albums and performing, Rockford announces to the music world that Robin Zander remains one of the most unique and commanding voices in rock-n-roll while Rick Nielsen, Bun E. Carlos and Tom Petersson continue to enchant and impress fans new and old.the first few listens.  <br /> <br />Rockford serves to remind the skeptical music fan that it is possible to produce an extremely rocking yet melodic record in this day and age without the angst and gripe that plague today's younger rock bands.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|The product I ordered came quickly and was in mint condition, still in the original packaging. It's sometimes hard to know what you will get when ordering on the internet, but this has been a great experience.
B00062ZE58|5.0|I can't really say I'm unbiased in this but then again that is what reviews are for. I was introduced to WT with this album and it is solid goodness throughout. WT are often compared to Evanescence but the vocals of Sharon, the lead of WT as well as the overall 'sound' of the band makes WT by far the better of the two. <br />If you are new to Within Temptation prepare for a whole new sound than I dare say anything you ever heard. There's a richness to the range of the instruments used and the vocals are out of this world. The voice is haunting and the songs stay with you. It is in short an amazing album and while this may not initially sound like your taste, try it out, I guarantee you will not regret it!

1573921394|5.0|I'm an undergrad economics student, and I was always puzzled by the \\"Keynesian\\" economics they taught me. I couldn't see how it fit in with the market clearing story they were also telling me. So I decided to give this book a shot. After reading it, I was surprised at how simple the main concept is. I didn't find it difficult to read at all, or badly organized (but maybe that's because I'm used to reading philosophy). Basically, just like they teach you in Principles of Macroeconomics, the heart of the theory is the Keynesian Cross (which is a rough approximation of Keynes' D-Z model in this book). The consumption function leaves a gap between income and expenditures, which must be filled by planned investment, or the economy will move to a lower equilibrium via the multiplier. Classical economics, in effect, just assumes that gap is always filled by planned investment (where the economy is at full employment, no less) without even making an argument for it. In the classical model, any decrease in planned investment is matched by an increase in consumption, or vice versa. But there is no good reason to think that will be the case, generally. If you hoard your money today, businessmen do not have a magic crystal ball that allows them to determine what you will spend it on in 5 years. Thus they do not invest. A decrease in consumption is not matched by an increase in planned investment. The economy will move to a new, lower equilibrium via the Keynesian Cross, in which income equals expenditures (i.e. no hoarding any more).     The one thing I did find confusing in the book, though, was Keynes' assertion that saving always equals investment, by defintion. I determined that this results from an incorrect definition of saving. While on an individual level, saving is income minus consumption, the same is not true for the economy as a whole. It is more accurate to say that saving in the aggregate is always zero, because an individual act of saving is always matched by anequal amount of dissaving by someone else (the saving deprives them of their income, unless the the savings are invested, in which case they are no longer savings). The gap between income and consumption, in the aggregate, is always investment. Its just the form of investment that changes. If the gap between income and consumption isn't filled by planned investment, it will be filled up by \\"unplanned\\" investment (i.e. inventories build up). In macroeconomic equilibrium, there is no unplanned investment. Thus, Y = Ip (planned investment) + C. Classical economics assumes that Y - C always equals Ip, and at the point of full employment. Keynes's theory is the more general case when Y - C could equal Iu (unplanned investment). In that case, the economy moves to a below optimal equilibrium that does not correspond to full employment.     I would definitely recommend this book if you're an economist, or if you have anything to do with public policy. Or even if you're just curious. Don't be frightened off by the people who tell you its \\"unreadable\\" or \\"a mess.\\" They just can't handle a real scholar who writes precisely and clearly.

Marc Anthony did a great job on this cd with Jennifer Lopez.  I like all of the songs.  I even like her singing.  Jennifer Lopez should continue to develop her vocal career.
B00068TJM6|4.0|Very nicely done chronograph. The fit/form is tight and the styling is masculine without the feel of wearing a 5lb sundial on your arm. The display could be a little brighter at night but on the other hand, if that had been a priority I would have purchased a Luminox. All in all, it's an excellent timepiece that should last a very long time. Excellent price and hey, it's a Seiko! What more needs to be said?

0307346609|5.0|As the son of Hollywood and Broadway funnyman Mel Brooks, one would expect a book by son, Max, to be rife with the same over-the-top, bawdy and side-splitting humor for which his father is notorious. Especially considering the subject of choice: Zombies. <br /> <br />Brooks' previous effort was a comprehensive Zombie Survival Guide which outlined how the common North American civilian could survive zombie attacks on a small scale, as well as how to survive the catastrophic possibility of worldwide infection (by Brooks' reckoning, zombieism is a condition brought on by the virus Solanum, not reanimation by dark, supernatural forces). <br /> <br />In his latest work, World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, the absolute worst has come to pass. Through ignorance, miscommunication, unpreparedness and sheer negligence, the entire world has been overrun by the living dead. <br /> <br />Yet instead of a comic rendition of zombies roaming the earth and being systematically wiped out by the oft-cast, steely-eyed and determined Hero, we are given a vivid recounting of humanity in a war for survival against the overwhelming hordes of undead which very nearly wipes the living human race from the face of the earth. <br /> <br />Brooks presents this history in a series of interviews with principle characters across the globe in a conflict that has lasted, and in some respects continues, for ten years. These interviews are grouped into chapters from the initial detection and outbreaks, to reactions from numerous governments which vary from mobilization to denial to isolation to complete ignorance, through the conflict and the aftermath as the world rebuilds. Those who have survived to offer interviews show the effects of the conflict in very visible ways, from those who are psychologically shattered to those who discover something new and purposeful about themselves when before their value was negligible. They are very often unheroes, with little social worth or self-respect, who rose to the occassion when the world fell under attack. <br /> <br />Throughout, Brooks emphasizes the changes from the world as it was: political disunity, racial and class discrimination; to the world that it has become: unified in the purpose of survival, then victory. <br /> <br />It highlights the wastefulness of government, the shattering of the social structure (who needs actors, entertainers or athletes in a world where survival is paramount?), and the galvanization of the entire species with the purpose of achieving a single goal. The book essentially states, without ever saying as much, that the near extinction of humanity by the living dead is the best thing that could ever have happened, returning a sense of urgency and purpose to a very sedentary people. The book is a statement on how the dominant species of our planet is, in truth, extremely vulnerable. <br /> <br />This book is not utterly without humor, though the younger Brooks does not express it in the same explicit fashion as his father. There are various, subtle references to movies (Ghostbusters), cartoons (Transformers), video games (Myth) and even his own Survival Guide (which is snubbed by one interviewee as \\"clearly written by an American\\") which only someone who has come into contact with them will catch. Yet these humorous instances are downplayed because the main thrust of this book was not comedy, as booksellers would lead you to believe. <br /> <br />Perhaps this oral history was created with ironic, comic intentions, but the message it conveys is one of very serious warning. We are a fractured people full of needless bile, and if we could but work together rather than focus upon our differences there is no obstacle we cannot overcome. But if we choose to remain stubborn, indignant and hateful, ignorant of one another and our respective cultures, we will almost surely be swallowed up by whatever disasters, be they zombies or otherwise, which lurk just around the corner.
0671015206|4.0|I used to work as a vice president with a large salty snack company in America.  While I worked hard, and did a good job, my pay was obscene.  My annual cash was in the neighborhood of $350,000 when I left, and there were at least three levels of executives above me, making even more!  Many of my coworkers lived the life, and burned through $250,000 or more every year.  Big house, 7-series beemer, Lexus SUV for the wife, private schools for kids (and new cars on 16th birthdays), lake house, expensive clothes, european ski vacations. <br /> <br />Not me, baby.  I saved like a neurotic squirrel gathers nuts in November.  I have a nice home, drive a 6 year-old Saab that runs great, smoke nice cigars, put my daughters through college, and have enough money not to have to work for many years, if ever again. <br /> <br />This book is about people like me, who earn money and aren't stupid enough to spend all of it.  They become, quite literally, the millionaire next door--your neighbors who drive a 2002 Honda, ski in Colorado vs. Europe, and wear Dockers vs. Armani.  Simple lessons here--live below your means, and save your money.  You will retire earlier and happier than other \\"rich\\" people.
B000063DIR|5.0|Yes is sounds different than the original.  Yes Airy and Kerslake were screwed twice...Sharon's a greedy pig, Ozzie's an idiot, yada yada yada.  All that can't deny that fact that this version sounds better, overall.  There's much more bottom end, Randy's guitar is thickened and brought even more so into the fore front.  The result is a much more deeper, resonate modern mix.  The only track inferior to the 95 mix, is Tonight.  Totally messed up the guitar solo mix at the end.  Nevertheless, big improvement in sound quality over the original.  Disregard people who either hold on to hard to the past, or have a problem with the Osbornes.

B000N6TX1S|3.0|Alfonso Cuaron's treatment of P.D. James futuristic novel is a stylish exercise, a cautionary tale filmed with professional care and finesse, but it's also a dark, violent story with no resolve or emotional satisfaction.<br /><br />It's 2027 in England, in a world where a child hasn't been born in twenty years...why we're never told, but it is a world replete with revolutionary uprisings and unflinching bias.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Theo, a young man who is approached by a former lover, who is now a \\"terrorist\\" (Julianne Moore in a very surprisingly brief appearance) to help her smuggle a young pregnant girl to safety.  Double crosses and tragedy ensue.  Michael Caine steals his scenes as a kind of \\"hippie\\" friend who aids and abets.  While visually stunning and well acted, the movie isn't as satisfying as one would expect and it's grim outlook is rather unsettling although provocative.
B000MGUZMU|4.0|Having loved Funeral I couldn't wait to get my hands on Neon Bible.  I loved the songs they sang on SNL.  Overall, I would say Neon Bible is excellent, but a step below Funeral.  I found it much more uneven.  I loved most of the songs but found some to be a tad boring, Black Mirror and My Body is a Cage come to mind.  Also, I made the mistake of ordering the deluxe version, which was a waste of money.  Deluxe meant that it came with a couple of lame little flip books in little box.  Save your money and get the jewel case version.  It is a must buy for Arcade Fire fans, and most of the songs are excellent.  Enjoy!!
B000286RKW|5.0|This Special Edition is great. The movie itself is pefectly done and directed, also the cast is one of the best when it comes to mafia movies.  <br /> <br />There's just a little problem.....I don't know if is my DVD copy but at the scene where Jimmy(Robert Deniro), Henry(Ray Liotta) and Paul(Paul Sorvino) are together discussing about Henry's problems certainly a vertical line appears in the middle of the screen. I rewinded it to make sure it wasn't my t.v. but the line appeared again, like i said before maybe it was just my DVD copy. Other than that there's no problem.  <br /> <br />So those of you who enjoy mafia movies this one is definitely a must have on your collection....
B00008K7AM|5.0|A brilliant updating of Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. Almost every possible combination of what it means to be a man or a woman is explored. And the ulitmate question of the movie: how do you know if it is love? Is put to the test by numerous situations. Of course, even if it is true love, are there limits to what a person is willing to do for the one they love?

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|To all you casual movie fans out there, you shouldn't pay any mind into the film geeks who take so much time showing you their fancy vocabulary.  After all, a good review is one that simulataneously speaks your impressions and tries to be useful to others. As such I will say that this film will not be appealing to a number of people for a few reasons <br /> <br />1)Many feel that film noir is out-dated and should be put out to pasture for good. <br />2)There are people out there who absoltely love film noir of the past and completely reject the modern versions of them <br />3)The characters and coventions of film noirs are meant to walk the line of unrealistic stereotypes and still hold out the intention that this story could happen to anyone. <br />4)The fact this involves primarily high schoolers will turn off the hard core fans, confuse casual filmgoers, and live on as a maligned attempt at a new school noir. <br /> <br />To those who can get past any those will have a film that plays with the conventions it's handed and comes out pretty good, even though the ending isn't as detective-worthy as you'd think. Yes, Brandon is a convention of the story, but so is everyone in the story we call life. Does he have realistic qualities to his character and is what happens to him possible for others as well? Yes.  The movie, like all noirs, plays it tough and doesn't really give you a lot of character development, the only real glimpse into why Brandon is what he is is shown in the film as a flashback.  As a character says to him \\"you're thick\\" meaning that he's got an internal temper that won't allow him to give things up easily and that's the key to the story of his character.  I find the story realistic, high schools are battle grounds where violence can and does take place, both in the limelight and out. Do kids deal drugs? Are you kidding? For those who can't suspend their disbelief, it just goes to show you that the film presents a fiction and reality that some people just can't take. The film isn't a masterpiece, but for breaking some ground in the noir genre, it more than makes up for its deficiencies. It's funny, cleverly plays around the conventions and contains textbook noir performances which are more reliant on wordplay than expression, although a little more expression would be nice. To sum up this entire review and how I feel about it: It's imperfect, but it works well.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|If you own all of John Mayer's albums you need to add this one to your collection. By far, the best he has put out to date. This album is everything I expected and then some. Very bluesy and just easy to listen to. \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" is by far my favorite and in my opinion the best track on the CD.  I think people who listen to this album will in some way relate to what he is singing about. I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!  If you're not a John Mayer fan buy this album and you will become one.

B000LXHK22|4.0|I haven't been to a theater in years. Instead, I see movies on a small screen in business class in \\"The Friendly Skies,\\" in which I travel over 200,000 miles a year (mostly internationally). This film has been on United Airlines' playlist (in various markets) for a couple of months, and I keep watching it (or parts of it) for the cinematography and, as strange as it may seem, for the music, which defines \\"eclectic\\" (if not \\"seductively intoxicating\\"). The movie's fine -- better than most of the drivel cranked out by Hollywood. Though largely predictable, it has a few surprises, most of them pleasant, and it has a happy ending. It is also splendidly free from violence. Though I despise \\"chick flicks\\" (most of which having the allure of the used facial tissues which they generate), this is about as close to one as I can tolerate (and still feel comfortable to walk through a door marked \\"men\\"). The scenery is splendid, the story is corny (but pleasantly tolerable, if not likeable), and I found the movie to be better than the other amateur reviewers suggested on these pages. Moreover, I can't get out of my head the hodge podge of music that constitutes the sound track, which is on its way to me, with the assistance of Amazon. I'll likely buy the video and watch it from time to time (and smile while doing so), as this one's \\"a keeper.\\" Chalk one up to \\"nice.\\"
B00005O3VC|4.0|I've always loved MP so this movie is a must have.  Very funny in a british sort of way.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This romantic zombie film will appeal to most people, unless you have a particular aversion to gore movies (the special effects are very good). Simon Pegg stars as Shaun, an ordinary guy who works in an electrical goods store. On the day his girlfriend dumps him there is an outbreak of zombies and he has to save her and his friends including layabout Ed (played by Nick Frost). The cast is very good, as well as Simon Pegg, theres Dylan Moran from Black Books, Lucy Davis from The Office and cameo roles from two others from both those series. Whilst I didn't find it laugh out loud all the time, it always kept me interested and surprisingly there are a number of quite moving moments.<br /><br />Of course this film wouldn't have existed but for George Romero's classic zombie movies, so just like in his Dawn of the Dead (largely set in a shopping mall) until their numbers are overwhelming the zombies are really pretty useless. In some ways this film is similar to Mel Brooks classic 'Young Frankenstein', which itself was a comedy based on a classic horror film. In both cases the films are affectionate parodies rather than straight spoofs.<br /><br />The film has a lovely twisted ending, and I'm pretty sure it will hold up to repeated viewings, so I'll be watching again fairly shortly!
B0009MDPYM|4.0|I personally didn't buy this movie because if its \\"stars.\\"  I liked the premise and the directing.  I think both were done very well.
B00004XONN|5.0|Okay. When I was growing up, all that my parents gave me to listen to was their old '80s new wave CDs and LPs. Now I'm 17 years old, and I just started growing out of their generation's music about a year and a half ago. Now I find myself in search of music that stretches the limits of the human imagination to boundaries it has never before seen. In this new musical journey I'm going through, I've been listening to bands like Tangerine Dream, They Might Be Giants, Beck, The Apples In Stereo, and of course, Radiohead. <br /> <br />Kid A was a gigantic leap forward in Radiohead's growth as a progressive rock band. Laden with intense cascades of synthesizer riffs and pulsating drum beats, one would expect that Kid A would be difficult to listen to for the average person. Since I always assumed myself to be fairly average in my musical taste, I kind of assumed the same. Once I bought the album and popped it into my CD player, I was lost in the sea of synthesizers that is the opening track, \\"Everything In Its Right Place.\\" I found that Thom Yorke's voice, which many have labeled as \\"whiny,\\" effectively communicates the overall feeling that the album is trying to portray. <br /> <br />As the listening experience went on I found myself growing attached to \\"The National Anthem.\\" It starts so simply with a repeating bass riff, and builds into an eruption of orchestral chaos that must be heard to believe. Only Thom could put it the right way: \\"Everyone around here, everyone is so near, it's holding on...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Treefingers,\\" at first listen, sounds like a wacky synthesizer experiment, yet the entire piece was played on guitars and heavily modified and composed into an instrumental on a computer. It acts as a perfect segway into the following track, \\"Optimistic,\\" another alternative ballad whose stark portrayal of our modern lives is drowned by the pounding drums and tectonic guitar riffs. <br /> <br />After \\"In Limbo\\" comes \\"Idioteque,\\" one of Radiohead's boldest musical departures from their earlier style. It throws all the rules they went by out the window, coming in with a stomping synthesized drum track and one of the most impressive chord progressions I've ever heard. The samples of early electronic music used in the song, as well as the apocalyptic lyrics \\"Ice age coming, let me hear both sides...we're not scare mongering, this is really happening\\" portray the world of nuclear war and political struggle ever so clearly.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I might not like all of the animation from every story, but every story is truly amazing. It gives the back story to the movies and proves that we are to blame for everything. I'd say that most stories will have you glued to the screen, and even in tears. The final story is about humans capturing a robot and playing with it to make it friendly, and at the end, it tries to save one of the women's life. It is a sad story, overall, this is a thing that is worth getting if you are a fan.
0618680004|5.0|What can be said by a Dawkins fan that hasn't be said in the superlative already. I just wish he had used the word \\"deception\\" or \\"fallacy\\" or \\"fiction\\" even fabrication or lie, instead of delusion with its mental health association. I bet he wishes the religious were treatable with Olanzapine! Relusion is a better word for a non psychotic irationally held belief but I accept it wouldn't have the same impact in the title.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|The first half is not great, but the second half is a masterpiece of speculative fiction, and creates a violent poetry as it shows the clash between concern for a child and scenes of depravity in war. The supporting cast is distracting with their sometimes unconvincing and overly self-aware portrayals of their characters, but the entire film is made believable through the able acting of Clive Owen throughout.
B000O1799U|1.0|Sorry but this movie did not WOW me like the rest of the world! Great performances by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy (neither Oscar worthy, sorry) and the rest of the cast but the actual Broadway play was MUCH better! Why did they kill James Thunder Early? Why are they so set on making this a Diana Ross & the Supremes story? All the references to Motown and picture stills from old Supremes album covers.....come on! Why'd they change the story and use Detroit rather than Chicago as where things began for the Dreamettes? And where did the drug habit come from for Thunder Early? (People swear this was based on David Ruffin's death...?)The original Supremes (Primettes, sister group to the Primes...later the Temptations) spent many years at Motown doing hanclaps and bckgrnds and were known as the \\"No-Hit\\" Supremes before \\"Where did our Love Go\\" hit! <br />I like what Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson said in JET mag about the movie...read it. They don't like it, lots of inacuracies.  <br />Big thumbs up on the FABULOUS cast of actors/singers and great songs. I am indeed glad that a black musical was brought to the screen after so many years. Not happy with the story depicted. Great costumes and music (get those UGLY wigs off of Jamie Foxx, Hinton Battle...YUK) <br />Pretty good movie but not Oscar worthy. Maybe the \\"extras\\" such as deleted scenes, more songs..etc will be good on this DVD. <br />Now I'm waiting on the Broadway Play to come to DVD so I can see the real story without changes.   <br />
B0002KK4F4|2.0|Unfortunately, I travel a lot and I originate from an isolated country which means that I will have stop-over in different timezones. I don't care for fancy watches, I need something basic that allows me to instantly know the time when I reach a stop-over or destination. Given that sometimes my flights last for 30 hours with 4 timezone, the exhaustion of it makes me lose track of day.  <br /> <br />Firstly, as far as I am concerned there's only one source of time and that is UTC (or GMT)... All the other times are UTC adjusted for TZ and DST. This is how the clock in Microsoft Windows works and I think it's very logical and efficient.  <br /> <br />Today I bought DB-E30D and regretted the decision when I read the manual- it states three basic items that make this watch incompatible with this way of thinking: (1) \\"The time settings of Timekeeper mode and World Time mode are independent from each other, so you must make separate settings for each.\\" (2) it's only possible to copy the time from the Timekeeper mode to World Time mode but not visa versa; (3) DST setting in World Time mode affects every time setting in every timezone. To me, these are design faults.  <br /> <br />The other design faults are: (4) there's no TZ or DST associated with alarms; (5) there's no day or date associated with a displayed timezone in World Time mode.  <br /> <br />Just to clarify, Timekeeper mode is your current time, day and date - this is what you normally see when you look at your watch. World Time mode is where you can see the time for a 25 different timezones.  <br /> <br />The ramifications of (1) I have to deal with two time settings instead of one, even though I'm haven't left Earth; (2) I cannot instantly set my main display to a time that is already seen in World Time mode - just as with normal 20 year old watch, I have to change the time manually; (3) DSTs stop/start at differnt times, so, this is just stupid; (4) I cannot instantly set appointment alarm for my destination(5) I cannot instantly determine the day at my destination. <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I realize this is a very volitile subject.  No one wants to leave the environment in shambles, but this propaganda needs to be exposed.  For starters, there are VASTLY more elements which control climate than CO2.  We haven't even tapped the surface of our understanding. A disclaimer at the beginning of this video should read, \\"At our current level of ignorance, we speculate....\\" The famous \\"hockey stick\\" graph is based upon a computer model, and we ALL know how acurrate the science of predicting the weather is!  There are too many prolems with this \\"documentary\\" to address them all in a single post.  What you DON'T see in the video is how the ice caps in Antarctica are growing and how Greenland has experienced MUCH warmer weather thousands of years ago without the catastrophic sea level rises predicted in our immediate future.  Basically, this is the same garbage we were fed in the 70's regarding \\"global cooling\\" and the emminent ice age we were heading towards.  Though I applaud Mr. Gore for being passionate, I must condemn him for being uninformed when it comes to the actual data and hold contempt for him for advancing such an ill advised and unscientific agenda.  Science isn't based upon a consensus of people agreeing(even though the IPCC itself has many members who disagree), it is based upon fact.  We would all do well to watch this video VERY objectively and research the claims ourselves before subscribing to the idea we are destroying the planet.  There's a VERY good explanation for global warming and it has mainly to do with the large firey ball in the center of our solar system.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|Mastodon seems to be blowing up faster than any other metal band currently on the scene. The reason being is that instead of being tougher, badder, or meaner than anyone else in their genre, they're just better.    The musicianship on this album is unreal. Brann Dailor continues to stand out as one of metal's most gifted drummers, yet has a sound that's more big band/drum line than metal (hey, it works!) Though the band is fronted by both Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds, everyone contributes the singing in a band. Oh, and Bill Kelliher should've received the Grammy for best guitar slide on this album... but I digress.    The album starts off crazy, like most Mastodon albums do. However, when they do decide to tone it down, it's not mushy. Instead, the music could literally fill the room with it's mystique (I think Sleeping Giant and This Mortal Soil are examples of this). This is probably one of the most epic sounding metal albums around that hasn't required for it's song lengths to be overbearing to get the message and point across... and this is coming from a fan of Opeth, Tool, and Isis (I prefer the long songs, but these guys can just keep doing their thing.)    So to all you people who like epic metal, or those who want to get in an epic sounding album but don't have the attention span for the three other bands I admit to liking, this is the album you need.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you were a fan of \\"Sex and the City\\" then you'll appreciate having the complete series at your fingertips. Love love love the girls (and guys) and love New York.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|I read through the reviews of this album before hearing it in its entirety so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was hoping it wouldn't be this band's \\"Load.\\"  I heard \\"Crush 'Em\\" when it first came out and thought it sounded trite and played out so I wasn't expecting much. After listening to it, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  This album is very good.  It is original, still very crunchy, and Mustaine's vocals sound great.  It has songs that are melodic yet heavy such as \\"Wanderlust\\" and \\"Ecstasy.\\" It also has songs that are a clear departure for Megadeth but are very good like \\"I'll be There.\\"  Mustaine's guitar work stands out and you can tell he pushed himself to new heights on several songs, most notably \\"Seven.\\"  I didn't like \\"Time: The Beginning\\" as it sounds somewhat stale.  However, \\"Time: The End\\" more than makes up for it.  That song is awesome and the background vocals are off the charts.  Mustaine's playing during that song is great too.  The bonus track \\"Insomnia\\" is classic Megadeth and would have fit perfectly with several previously released Megadeth albums.<br /><br />I am a big fan of classic Megadeth but welcome this change in style as it is a subtle yet very innovative departure from the classic Megadeth sound.  The songs are catchy, well written and creative.  I recommend this for fans of Megadeth and for fans of the genre.
B00008EY65|5.0|So, you've seen the HELLBOY live action movie, and/or the animated material, loved it, and are thirsting for more tales of the red skinned chief investigator of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense? Lucky for you there are several items currently available that should (at least temporarily) quench your thirst.<br /><br />If you'd like to relive the movie, try the HELLBOY novelization, by Yvonne Navarro. Navarro is an old hand at adapting screen properties, both large and small (she's done several BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER books, plus novelizations of SPECIES I and II) and can be counted on to do so in a readable and entertaining manner. Her work on HELLBOY is no exception. Writing from director Guillermo del Toro's script, and adding in her own little extras based on her intimate knowledge of the source material (she even gets HELLBOY's alternative spelling of \\"pancakes,\\" substituting \\"m\\" for \\"n\\", correct), she produces a faithful adaptation of the movie. If you like her HELLBOY book, you might also sample some of Navarro's original novels. Books like AFTERAGE and MIRROR ME (available from The Overlook Connection Press), THAT'S NOT MY NAME, FINAL IMPACT, and RED SHADOWS are all well worth your time and money.<br /><br />If you wish to explore the comics that inspired the film, there are several reasonably priced HELLBOY collections available from Dark Horse Comics. The movie's main inspiration comes from HELLBOY: SEED OF DESTRUCTION, written and drawn by HELLBOY 's creator, Mike Mignola, with an able assist from the venerable John Byrne of Superman and X-Men fame. HELLBOY: CONQUEROR WORM explores ideas Mignola touched on in SEED OF DESTRUCTION, finally explaining the origins of the strange race of aliens who appeared in that story.<br /><br />If you like those, you can sample HELLBOY: WAKE THE DEVIL, HELLBOY: THE CHAINED COFFIN, and HELLBOY: THE RIGHT HAND OF DOOM. WAKE THE DEVIL is one long story, the other two volumes present several stand alone short stories which explore world mythology and folklore (THE CHAINED COFFIN features \\"The Corpse\\", an amusing tale whose events feature prominently in the movie). To see how other folks handle HELLBOY and his eclectic supporting cast, try BPRD: HOLLOW EARTH AND OTHER STORIES, and HELLBOY: WEIRD TALES.<br /><br />If plain old prose is what floats your boat, there are several worthy original HELLBOY novels, among them HELLBOY: ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HELL by Brian Hodge, HELLBOY: THE GOD MACHINE by Thomas Sniegoski, HELLBOY: UNNATURAL SELECTION by Tim Lebbon, and three by Christopher Golden (of OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS fame), namely HELLBOY: THE LOST ARMY, HELLBOY: THE BONES OF GIANTS, and HELLBOY: THE DRAGON POOL.  Golden also ably edited HELLBOY: ODD JOBS, an anthology featuring short stories by the likes of the aforementioned Brian Hodge, Poppy Z. Brite, Nancy Collins, Greg Rucka, and Chet Williamson.rt stories which explore world mythology and folklore (THE CHAINED COFFIN features \\"The Corpse\\", an amusing tale whose events feature prominently in the movie).

0743496728|4.0|I was touched by these characters in NINETEEN MINUTES by Jodi Picoult. I think she really came back with a winner. I took this and \\"A Line Between Friends\\" by Michele Cozzens on a recent ski trip and loved them both.
B000N6TX1S|2.0|I should have read the book first.  Everything was moving so fast including violence, gore and subplots I just was overwhelmed.  Perhaps because it seemed everyone had a gun and wanted to wontonly shoot everyone else, it reminded me of the unpleasantness in the war we are currently trying to disengage ourselves from.  I think subtleness is an art and this movie lacks it entirely. Everything is just exploded on the screen to jar us into senselessness.  I think if the government plot was more elaborate it will have alientated me less.  I am off to buy the book.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I do not normally review DVD's but 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' got my attention.This is of course the true story of Chris Gardner,an entrepeneuring San Franciscan played by Will Smith who peddles heavy Bone Density machines to support his girlfriend and young son (played by Will's own son Jaden).One thing leads to another,his girlfriend leaves Chris,one things leads to another and Chris and his little boy end up living in a church mission for a time;it's a bones to rags to riches story in and of itself.But many things impressed me about it.Will Smith really threw himself believably into his character and little Jaden is actually a pretty fine actor;very very believable.And if this is autobiographically correct I think Chris Gardner was a good parent for one reason if nothing else;he didn't lie to his son.Instead of making promises he could'nt keep,he did his best to keep the boy safe and calm and always told him the truth as he could understand it,even if it wasn't what the boy wanted to hear.The juxtaposition of actuall homeless people with actors was a great idea as Jaden's sometimes confused and frightened interactions all the more real;no child should have to go through what he does in this movie.But Chris maintains his dignity extremely well even at the lowest ebb of riding the subway all night,because there was nowhere else to be.Even studying as a non salery intern at Dean Witter Chris is a very intelligent man;he encourages and respects his son's thirst for knowledge,has an idedic memory for numbers and can solve rubix cubes in a few minutes.But where he seems to fail is common sense.Most of the things he went through would'nt have occured had he not been so obsessed with people who ran off with his Bone Density machines;these escapades lead him to almost get killed by a car.But he's doing it all for his child.'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is kind of an oxymoron because this is more about the pursuit.There isn't a lot of happy moments in this movie no.Some light humor.Another good thing is Will Smith produced this himself and totally avoided the mawkish melodrama movies about this subject have tended to have in the best-he concentrates on humanity and genuine love.It's a true story and nothing is over the top;it did and could all really happen.But even at it's saddest moments 'Pursuit Of Happiness' is very positive.Of course it has a happy ending but that isn't the point-the journey is what's important.It doesn't glamorize homelessness-it glamorizes love and fatherhood and if you have to glamorize something aren't those worthwhile?This is a great movie to see-it's smells of MAJOR oscers and I hope it receives them.ight humor.Another good thing is Will Smith produced this himself and totally avoided the mawkish melodrama movies about this subject have tended to have in the best-he concentrates on humanity and genuine love.It's a true story and nothing is over the top;it did and could all really happen.But even at it's saddest moments 'Pursuit Of Happiness' is very positive.Of course it has a happy ending but that isn't the point-the journey is what's important.It doesn't glamorize homelessness-it glamorizes love and fatherhood and if you have to glamorize something aren't those worthwhile?This is a great movie to see-it's smells of MAJOR oscers and I hope it receives them.

B00005JPLU|3.0|After watching this movie the other day, I have to say it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm funny about Hollywood messing around with ancient history so you may not want to use me as a guide for this review of 300.<br /><br />Miller has talent. I don't think many would dispute that claim. However, his talent lies in his original material such as Sin City and not his bent on classical history, for example. I found it difficult to suspend disbelief when I saw the scene with the Delphic Oracle or the various creatures throughout the film.<br /><br />I will say the battle scenes are well done and the acting is pretty decent which is why I decided to give this three stars instead of two.<br /><br />In the end, Miller is better off sticking to what he knows and should not venture too far from his area of expertise. My Greek and Roman Tragedy professor even liked it. Like I said, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to things historical so don't go by me. But, play it safe and watch this as a rental.<br /><br />Thanks.

A very young Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin do a wonderful duet, one I hadn't heard before. Throw in Angie Dickinson as a femme fatale and you've got some well-matched actors having great fun with their characters. Wayne is a sheriff who is put to the test when he must arrest the brother of a rich rancher. Though the charge is murder, the rich rancher will stop at nothing to get his scoundrel of a brother out of jail. Wayne is left with a drunk, a greenhorn and a limping old man to help him fend off the bad guys.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0374105235|5.0|This book was a real eye-opener for me. I'd heard of child solidiers, but this book made it real for my with its no holds-barred look at what this child went through, what he saw, what he was forced to do and how it changed who he was. I now look at the African wars much differently, and Beah does not sugar-coat his role. But it's also a testament to human spirit's ability to rebound. It's beautifully written book that vividly draws the reader in to Beah's world and evokes a multitude of emotions with each passing page.

0307237699|3.0|BUT..... not quite as good as his first work. In my review of his last book, I mentioned that it was more or less free of political porn, a la Limbaugh, Franken, etc... Well I can't really say that about this one... This is really more of a statement of his beliefs and why he believes them, but not so much an autobiography. Those looking for either ammunition against him (ie those on the right looking proof that he is indeed a \\"Godless\\" liberal...) or those who really like him but want to know why (lefties) will find much to like in this book. Even those who haven't made up their mind about him may find it enlightening. It's one of the better political \\"this-is-who-I-am\\" type books that I have read. Not too painfull at all.. But make no mistake... there are politics involved, but without the savage personal attacks we've had to endure from pundits in the left/right war(though in fairness he does jab at some republicans/conservitive views, but in a fairly respectful way.). It does have a whiff of the cheesey posturing that most books of this type have; but as I said, the man can write, so I guess I didn't notice THAT much. So okay, it's not political porn, per se, but...hmmm... political burlesque perhaps? <br /> <br />In my last review, I also said that it (the first book) didn't seem like it was written by a politician; it seemed like it was written by a human... Well, this one was written by a politician (albeit a very inteligent one). <br /> <br />To me though, the one chapter that retains the wonderful balance of emotion and articulation of his first effort was the final, entitled \\"Family\\" (chapter nine). If you get this book, say, from the library and run out of time, read at the very least that one... The insight and heartfelt prose in that chapter tied it all together and made it a worthwhile read. <br />  <br />(my ratings: *=poor **=average ***=good ****=excelent *****=perfect in every way)
B000002AGN|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Take Five\\" by Dave Brubeck Quartet from the album \\"Time Out,\\" it rocked my ears and this remarkable jazz tune never left me since then. It's always so enjoyable listening to this Paul Desmond composition, one of the best-ever jazz pieces recorded.<br /><br />Thanks to the exceptional musicianship of Dave Brubeck Quartet composed of Paul Desmond on alto sax, Joe Morrello on drums, Eugene Wright on bass, and Dave Brubeck himself on piano. They have created an album that is so remarkably brilliant and so deserving to be in every jazz lover's music library.<br /><br />I can't put a price on this classic of an album. \\"Take Five\\" alone is worth the price of admission.

It is, quite simply, a film about miscommunication at all levels and the ways in which we can, and do, become isolated from each other. <br /> <br />I found it incredibly moving and sad.  It's like finding something that you can do little about other than to be aware that it's there.  The message, I think, is that we should each try to make an extra special effort with each other.

0920668372|5.0|[[ASIN:0920668372 Love You Forever]]    I received this book as a baby shower gift, not knowing of its powerful message until I read it one day before my son was born.  Halfway through, I could not read the rest; the tears would not stop flowing.  Why did it affect me so much?  Afterall, I knew nothing at the time about raising kids, because I just had my first.  Because of my post-partum condition, I felt that it was not a good idea to read something that evoked so much emotion.  After a year I decided to finish reading the few remaining pages without the tears.  It became clear to me that the book was more than just a story about the ordinary life of a mother who raises a disobedient son who later turns out ok.  The book is not meant for children, but for parents, grandparents, and parents-to-be.  Yet, the story has a far deeper meaning than good, healthy parenting.  The book was really written as an ode to the author's real life experience of losing his unborn twin babies.  The author was compelled to produce a lullaby song as a remembrance of this devastating experience.  The song was soon transformed into this book.  I think it was brave of Munsch to open his heart, to reveal of the love he was ready to give to his unborn twins.  As any parent, I now identify with this commitment to love.    I believe that this is the book's true message, which probably escapes some of the few negative reviewers.  With the commitment, a parent starts loving her child early in life to take firm root.  Early is the key; the seeds of love must be planted on newly born, unadulterated soil to grow.  Consistent attention to the basic needs (including emotional) of the infant, just like a young plant, are a must.  Love given, even in small doses, is better than love deprived from a child.  How can a young plant grow if it is deprived of essential sustenance?  It can't.  Same with children; if deprived of love, they will grow up not having the foundation to recognize and give love as adults.  The parent must weather through the disruptive but normal developmental stages of stubbornness and rebellion, and keep faith that her efforts to provide constant nourishment to her child's soul, as depicted by the mother in the book, will pay dividends!  Even if the parent can only provide love during the peaceful moments, like bedtime, somehow love gets absorbed, processed and stored in the brain and heart.  Love is working even when you are not conscious of it!  Love can penetrate the most stubborn, defiant individual and take root.  With consistent, unconditional efforts by a parent, a loved individual grows up with his roots healthy and deep in the foundation of love.  In time, he will have his own children, and they will be able to benefit from the tree which now bears the fruit from love.  And the cycle continues.  What a wonderful message this author brings to us in his book, especially written as an ode to his own heart-breaking experience.      Those who understand have given this book the five stars it deserves.
0385512058|4.0|I like his gentle approach to networking.  It does require girding up your loins and selling yourself, but on a friendly level.  He does not advocate clawing your way to the top.  He believes in being friendly to everyone.  The book is full of useful information and lots of examples.  I liked his use of the mistakes he made during his career; they included some good examples of what not to do.  He also looks at how technology helps us connect; he loves his gadgets which keep him connected wherever he goes.  He thinks we don't have too many people in our lives, but not enough.  I liked the concept of Refrigerator Rights (from the book of that name).  How many people do you let walk into your home and rummage through your fridge?  And I enjoyed these quotes: \\"A goal is a dream with a deadline.\\"  \\"Being known is just notoriety.  But being known for something is ... respect.\\"  This is an enjoyable, useful book.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|This movie is set in the year 2027, and humanity is on the verge of extinction. There has not been a baby born for 18 years, for women have become infertile for some unknown reason, and the government is behind it.<br /><br />Now Clive Owen is asked by his ex, Julianne Moore(the leader of a human rights organization called \\"Human Project\\" fighting against the Government) to help get a pregnant woman out of the country.<br /><br />She delivers her baby before they can get out and there are many obstacles blocking thier way.<br />When she has the baby in a ramshackle building, it makes you think of another miraculous birth 2,000 years ago, and the birth in this movie is....something to behold.<br /><br />I think this is one of the most original sci-fi movies made in a long time.I also loved the soundtrack, and especially the title song off an old King Crimson album \\"In the court of the Crimson King.\\"<br />The soundtrack really FIT somehow.<br /><br />This movie was well acted, and directed and what I really do imagine the world to be like in the DISTANT future, not the near future as the movie is set in.<br /><br />Either way, the tone (and all of the surroundings in this movie is fittingly dark and sad. It puts you right in the middle of a tired and used up world that has an overall feel of being OVER.<br /><br />The DVD also has a lot of added special features, and one of them is showing how they made the birthing scene with the help of backdrops and computer animation to look so real! It really has some interesting material in it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Sci Fi I am sure you will love this.
B00000729S|5.0|The word Black does not appear in the song Monk Time.  That does not take anything away from the song and mostly all the songs on this CD are enjoyable.  I find 'Oh How To Do Now'  the most appealing.  Least appealing would be Cuckoo  and He Went Down to the Sea, which oddly seems to be influenced by the Beatles' Ticket to Ride. Cuckoo has unique instumentation but the words are mindless. The band depends on repetition to build their version of 1966 era rock sound.  Gary, the singer has the strained, scatchy voice of a weary protester, but makes it work because of the serious nature of some of the songs.  I have listened to it about 30 times in 3 weeks.  I haven't wearied of it yet.

0451196716|5.0|I find it ironic that perhaps Stephen King's greatest story is written under his pseudonym and also one of the books few people have heard about.  It's arguably my favorite novel - ever - and also holds the distinction of the book I have read the most (and the only story that has made me physically ill).<br /><br />The Long Walk is a superb sci-fi story that pits 100 teen boys against each other in a seemingly never-ending marathon death sport.  How exciting can the act of walking be?  VERY!  King masterfully unfolds a story with three-dimensional characters and an intricate duality about the nature of death between the contestants and the audience who cheers every step on their march.<br /><br />Fans of the genre may also like to read the Japanese cult novel BATTLE ROYALE which takes a distinctly different (and more extreme) take on child death sports.  For anyone reading this novel for the first time, I'm envious...enjoy the walk.

B000ESSTKG|5.0|Why the negative reviews?  Yes, the Cd re-master could have been better, but the Dvd holds its own.  Listening to the 5.1 mix on a surround system is unbelievable.  It's just like being in the studio.  The sound is much more broad and WAY FATTER!  Things that get lost in the stereo mix come through nice and clean since it isn't compressed to stereo.  The album sounds AMAZING!  The documentary is a bonus too, but a bit short at 35 mins for such a landmark album from DM.  The other albums have longer documentaries but when it all comes down to it, the 5.1 mix is what it's all about.

B000002KZA|4.0|Depending on who you are, the first two DM records may be viewed as some kind of false start for the synth-pop group. This is not really my favorite album by the group at all, but stands as a worthy inclusion of the album. I actually like most DM albums over this, but there is stuff that brings it together. <br /> <br />It's still kind of minimalist, but here the song-writing has improved. It's like a distant cousin to [[ASIN:B000002L75 Some Great Reward]], less developed and not quite as consistently good, but it's not really a bad album. It takes a little bit to get into, since apart from the singles, it's kind of indistinguishable. I'd probably give it three stars if not for \\"Love, In Itself\\" and \\"Everything Counts,\\" which still stand up as Depeche classics. The former is kind of quirky in its construction but shows the band's expermentation into acoustic guitars and piano samples here and there. I like Gore's simple lyrics here. Where on [[ASIN:B000002KYL A Broken Frame]] he seemed like he wanted to prove that Depeche could continue as the band they were, that was kind of the transistion from the beginning to here. The record in retrospect is kind of underproduced; you have to turn the volume up pretty high to hear the songs in even the sound they are on [[ASIN:B00000HY5N The Singles 81>85]]. In this case I may recommend you get the [[ASIN:B000N3ST8Y remastered version]] of the group's third LP (now, if only they'd make a standard version). There's also more Alan Wilder-penned tracks here than on any other Depeche Mode album, even if it's merely two songs. <br /> <br />If you're new to DM, I suggest you trying one of their other albums first, but if you love what you've heard from them, particularly \\"Some Great Reward,\\" I think that this would be worth checking out. Besides, it's fairly cheap as it is.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I'm sure plenty of people here will share their favorite humorous moments from this film, and there certainly are plenty. But I left with a feeling that's different than say an Adam Sandler or Will Ferrill dork-a-thon. This movie has heart, and it deals with the human condition.<br /><br />One theme that repeats itself is that \\"you don't win if you don't play\\" (to quote a Lotto slogan). Alan Arkin's character intimates this twice, once to Olive and once to his son (Greg Kinnear). When Olive relates her fear of losing (much of it based on the brainwashing of her father and his '9-Step Success Program'), how she doesn't want to be a loser, and that there's nothing worse than being a loser, Grandpa tells her that the only loser is the person who never tries. If one fails, at least he/she tried. Arkin again says this to his son, Kinnear, after he fails after trying to sell success. Kinnear may be bankrupt, but he tried, and you can't be a loser if you try.<br /><br />The other idea that stood out for me is similar to the Buddhist belief that life is suffering, and unless you suffer, you never truly live. Steve Carrell's character tells this to the silent son; quoting Marcel Proust, the man inadvertantly responsible for his failure. Carrell tells him that real growth in life and true wisdom come from making it through often unbearable pain. This, he says, is living, not so-called happiness. Without this conflict, there can be no growth; and when Proust looked back upon his life it wasn't the good times he cherished, it was the pain. Then they joke about how lucky the boy is to be given all of the \\"opportunities for growth\\" than the teen years offer.<br /><br />These are pretty heady themes for a Hollywood sit-com. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" isn't typical. It's not a typical dysfunctional family movie, it's not a typical roadtrip movie, and it's not a typical comedy. It's smart, and it leaves you with more than a tummy ache from too much popcorn.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|I graduated in 1971, a time of great changes and a time of what I would term, the greatest period of musical creativity in human history.  I believe Neil Young is a big part of that history.  The music of Neil Young and his counterparts such as CSN is a pure reflection of the mood and creativity of this period in time.  I am proud to be of this generation and the wonderful music it has given the world to enjoy. <br />Without the great music of this era, life would be much boring and without the joy of reflecting back to our memories of our own life experiences.  This CD\DVD is like a cornerstone of the foundation of that music. A perfect reflection of our generation and it's music. Thank you, Neil Young.

B000M5AJQS|2.0|I can not see why Scorsese won an Oscar for this movie. I mean I like Scorsese's other movies especially \\"Goodfellas\\", but this movie was not very good. The whole plot of the movie is interesting but the way the movie was made really did not work very well. The weird background music and the unnecessary cursing and tension between Mark Wahlberg's and Leonardo DiCaprio's character really made this movie hard to watch. I also dislike the fact that these Irish mafia guys are never really established as mafia guys. You don't see any really interesting stuff going on with these Irish mob guys. If you are the type of person that likes cool gangster movies you will be disappointed when you see this film. I really tried to like this movie but,I found myself waiting for it to be over. This has been the worst recent movie I have seen.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Although earlier albums hinted at the direction that they were heading in, Thick as a Brick (1972) constitutes the first full-blown album of progressive rock by the band.  With respect to the \\"concept\\" on Thick as a Brick (I may be way off here - I am just a Biologist), the cynical lyrics seem to take a poke at (amongst other things) English provinciality and the class system; certainly the \\"newspaper articles\\" on the cover reinforce this.  I should note however, that there are several alternative interpretations of the lyrics.<br /><br />The lineup on this album included Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitar, vocals, violin, saxophone, and trumpet); Martin Barre (electric guitar, lute); the excellent Barriemore Barlow (percussion, tympani); John Evan (piano, Hammond organ, and harpsichord); and Jeffrey Hammond (bass guitar, vocals).  All of the guys are fantastic players, and the addition of the amazing Barriemore Barlow was definitely a plus.  The intricate ensemble work on Thick as Brick is light years ahead of albums like Aqualung (1971) and is more in keeping with most English progressive rock practiced at the time by groups including Yes, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson etc.<br /><br />In contrast with Aqualung, which featured acoustic pieces and harder rocking pieces, Thick as Brick merges the two approaches and boosts the compositional and arranging sophistication to a new high.  Elements of classical form are also introduced and dense group ensemble work is emphasized over hard rock riffing.  In all fairness, there are heavy riffs on the album, but they are just more thought out and complex.  Melodies are also used more fully.  The difficulties of writing a continuous, 40+ minute piece for the original vinyl format were overcome by writing some \\"transitional\\" material on \\"Side 1\\" of the LP.  Hearing both sides played continuously on the CD format is pretty cool.<br /><br />The remastering of this album is very good and the \\"new and improved\\" Thick as a Brick features great sound quality along with an 11'48\\" live version of Thick as Brick taken from a concert at Madison Square Garden from 1978 (great sound quality) and a 16'28\\" interview with Ian, Martin, and Jeffrey.  The liner notes include the lyrics and original LP art.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb album by Jethro Tull that finds them playing full blown prog rock.  This album is very highly recommended along A Passion Play (1973).ality along with an 11'48\\" live version of Thick as Brick taken from a concert at Madison Square Garden from 1978 (great sound quality) and a 16'28\\" interview with Ian, Martin, and Jeffrey.

B000NPHGZO|5.0|I have to say I was really skeptical about liking this movie because I thought the movie was about magic. This movie is more of a love story with magic tricks being conducted by Edward Norton's character. I really like this movie because it is mysterious and yet it has a love story going on as well. Edward Norton did a very good job of playing the mysterious Eisenheim the illusionist and the tricks he conducts are quite interesting. This movie was also quite enjoyable because the lovely Jessica Biel plays Eisenheim's love interest. This was a very great movie because it has a love story, mystery and magic. This movie really makes you ask yourself is it magic or just an illusion.
B000MVQ9P2|5.0|I have just finished seeing the american theatrical release of this movie and boy am I thrilled! <br />I was very pleased with this great catch of a thriller/monster movie. I have read the other reviews and agree for the most part with most of what they have to say. <br />However... I believe I got more out of this. As a child I went to the saturday afternoon double features held at the local movie house. Most times they were Godzilla or Japanese monster movies. Also watched a great deal of them on chiller theater. Very few of them got by me, even with the recent releases to DVD and title changes, etc. <br />What I saw in this movie was homage paid to it's predecessors. Almost all of the earlier movies had a 'family unit' involved with destruction of whatever creature it was. There were moments of fairly stupid humor also scattered among the horrible moments. And political finger pointing always abounded (the strongest was the 'Smog Monster') The special effects at the time were good for a young child's imagination but pale in comparison to today's. <br />In this movie you get the family unit, a few political statements and the moments of humor. However, this beast is brand new and very scary. No flying turtle or rubber suits here. This guy means business and goes about it in a fast paced, ravenous manner.  <br />It's almost as though Korea is saying... Look, we can make a really frightening monster movie for ya... our first one will be great... and we'll pay homage to all the godzilla-esque type movies just to get the ball rolling. <br />This creature is done exceptionally well too. It's almost like the Korean Riverside version of 'The Relic'.  <br />I am hoping that this is just the beginning of a long line of films just as good, or even better, to come. It would be nice to see that genre revisited since hollywood is doing a really bad job with all the recent remakes of horror films... seems like these guys got something better going on.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This is my first introduction to Ray LaMontagne - and I feel lucky to have made this personal discovery. His music and lyrics are eloquent. There's nothing fast on this album, it's all intense, while lingering on the dark side. While I always look forward to putting this album on, I do sometimes find myself tiring of it before the end. At times, he sounds a bit like Joe Cocker meets melancholy. 'Empty' is one of the finest songs I've ever heard anywhere. I'm eager to hear LaMontagne's other albums.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|While this is not my favorite release from the always awesome Clutch (I am still torn between their Self Titled album and Pure Rock Fury, unless the wind blows in a different direction then I may be torn between Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive/Exodus) they have yet to release an album that isn't an instant classic. While this one lacks the hard rock of previous releases it makes up for it with a bluesy groove that still has Clutches stamp all over it.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|I think it's safe to assume that by now most people, whether they've seen \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" or not, are aware of the \\"rags to riches\\" theme that is the basis of the story. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the filmmakers have taken a great true-life story and turned it into a long, drawn out study in futility. The script was in dire need of tightening; three-fourths of the film did not have to be dedicated to Gardner's never ending battle with hardships and disappointments - and that machine! Viewers get the point at least halfway (if not sooner) through the movie.  <br /> <br />The script should have concentrated more on how his time as an intern at the brokerage firm helped lay the foundation for his future success - with the last act being more concerned with his growing financial success after he ventured out on his own; that's a great story that is never told - at least in the film. Instead, Gardner elaborates on that subject in the \\"Special Features\\" segment.    <br /> <br />As for Will Smith's performance, I can see why he was up for an Oscar. The fact that he didn't win in no way took anything away from a truly outstanding (and Oscar calibre) performance, matched only by his son's wonderful performance as well.  <br /> <br />Perhaps just as important as the message in the film is the discovery of Will Smith as a fine, leading actor in a dramatic role. That said, I hope \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" will be the vehicle that allows him to continue on in that direction. I have no doubt that in time he will get that Oscar he deserves.

It did make you feel good after reading it.
B00005JPLU|3.0|Writing a review of a film such as '300' when not a fan of comic book style, superheroes, violent games carried on by children's hand held instruments, a film so overwhelmingly popular with the public that it promises to be the largest grossing film in history, and a film based on a 1999 'graphic novel' (read comic book) by the talented writer-artist Frank Miller and colorist Lynn Varley in an updated version of the famous battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, places a viewer in a vulnerable position.  Yet every film made deserves the attention of a well-rounded examination and with that in mind this viewer offers the following thoughts.<br /><br />Zack Snyder directed this screenplay, sharing the writing credits with Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon about Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his group of 300 trained from birth soldiers to know no fear and to die as heroes who together fight the huge forces of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) while leaving behind Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) and the venomous Theron (Dominic West) to end to matters at hand in Sparta. A keen plan to meet the Persians (Persia of yore is now called Iran!) at a narrow gulch at Thermopylae supported the courage of the mighty buff Spartans to have a logistical advantage. But of course Xerxes' legions of rhinos, elephants and warriors ultimately kill all the Spartans: it is a story of heroism in the face of extraordinary odds.<br /><br />With the exception of a few moments at the beginning and a few well placed breathers through the long two-hour film the subject matter is fighting, blood, decapitation hither and yon, and piles of corpses used as barriers as the huge animals of Xerxes tumble off the cliffs.  Blood spatters the air and the actors and the story, giving credence to the illustration used to promote the film.  The problems, other than the 'overkill' of endless battle to the tune of soldiers shooting repeated 'HaRoos', for this viewer lie with the script which mixes contemporary slang with pompous Grecian proclamation - stretching the credibility of the story beyond the limit of tolerance; the excessive noise of battle in competition with a 'musical score' that keeps the volume to maximum level; the fact that the acting is minimal at best, though this may be part of the 'comic book' concept; and the apparent emphasis on having every Spartan look like the same beefcake mold form from an art department.<br /><br />There are a few moments of tenderness as when the Captain (Vincent Regan) watches his son's decapitated head float to the ground in slow motion and he for the first time offers human anguish. But for the most part this is a blood red movie that relies on audience appreciation for gore.  Yes, it is a successful cinematic transition of a comic book, but the real story of history being told is so much more moving. Yet the lines at the movie theaters remain long after 4 weeks of release...

B000JLSLZQ|5.0|At less than $20, this is a no brainer. If you are planning to own the movie, have it in blu-ray. <br /> <br />Aside from the well known picture quality differences between DVD and the blu-ray, this disc includes special features that must be close to two hours. From how this phantom project got started, to the casting of the crew, to showing all the team members (singing to the tune of the phantom), these special features simply help complete the story. <br /> <br />I LOVE the original musical, this movie version only adds to it. Of course, movies are not as intimate as watching live theatre, however, the camera angles, the visual effects, the costume all makes this a really nice movie to own. Love the movie cast! <br /> <br />Last but not least, a DVD upscaled provides a nice picture already. However, having it in high definition just makes the scenes and details so real.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I had high hopes for Happy Feet - fresh from an Academy Awards win for Best Animated Picture after competing with Pixar's Cars, I thought, wow this movie should be pretty entertaining.   <br /> <br />Watching it, the visuals are amazing.  Mixing live shots with CG, the visual experience is great.  The story, on the other hand, was purely random.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I had no feelings at all toward the movie.  I didn't care about the plots, the music (especially the music...) or anything else involved with it.  I lost interest about 40 minutes in when I realized this was all it was.  And what's \\"it\\"?  It is the random singing and dancing of penguins as their story about....their heartsong (?) and one young penguin who can't sing but can dance.  Shunned from his society (well, he can live there, but doesn't graduate with the other penguins and is often ridiculed by the others.  Finding a society of penguins that dance.....and that's where I lost interest.  There's some sort of meshing of cultures, something about fish and people recording them.....and the end. <br /> <br />I didn't enjoy it but I'm sure a child will love it.  It's definitely a movie tailored to the younger generations.

That desire to have people say of us, \\"Step back and watch what s/he can do.\\" That's what I found myself thinking while reading this novel.

The characters are well formed and believable. The dialog between characters isn't forced or corny. It is very intelligent and well polished.<br /><br />This book was a breath of fresh air in a genre that has produced a lot of mediocre tales.

B00011RPB0|5.0|Having watched Lost in Translation several times now, I am guessing that this is Sophia Coppola's own coming of age story, with her telling it now as the screenwriter and director.  She grew up around the movie business thanks to papa Coppola so Hollywood and films and celebrityville stuff does not awe her one bit.  She probably had a similar experience to the one Scarlett Johansen has in this film - she hooked up for a little while with a big male star.  She got pulled into his orbit and for the span of time it takes to shoot a film she and he connected, gave each other some comfort, and then irrevocably moved on to their separate universes.  Al Pacino's orbit?  Andy Garcia's?  Young Sophia got a chance to get inside big movie star's brain - and what he thinks is that it's all a bunch of BS, but the money and the women are nice.  Essentially, life is life whether you're rich and famous or whatever.  You still have to eat, sleep, find something to do with your time, deal with hassles, scratch your elbow, try to stay connected with people, and get through the day.   There is no magic land where full-fledged celebrities lay around in paradise - it's all an illusion.  Sophia uncovers the reality for us and I for one find it good to know that we are all human.
B00005JPLU|5.0|This movie was simply spectacular!!! The depth and darkness of the movie makes it simply beautiful and powerful to watch. It's haunting as well as chilling, but heart-warming all the same. You almsot become one with the characters...fighting along side them. Sparta becomes your country and your home. When this movie ends you'll be blown away. This movie was just simply spectacular. I could defiantly say the best movie so far of the year!!! This is defiantly a movie to own!

B000MNP2KI|4.0|As other reviewers have already given plenty of opinions on whether this was a good or bad entry in the series, I won't add to that.  However, I will say that I was very disappointed with the DVD extras on the second disc.  Here was a chance to really introduce the viewer to the new Bond and the new approach to the films.  Instead the producers choose to include an extremely boring special on Bond Girls (sounds better than it is) and trailers for other movies.<br /><br />I was really hoping to see extra like those on \\"The World is Not Enough\\" DVD set, but they weren't there.  Something they should have included was a special on Bond vehicles since there were two awesome cars in this film.  While this movie is a must have for all Bond fans, I think we'll have to wait until the \\"special edition\\" DVD comes out for some decent extras.
055358202X|5.0|A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)     Story- A+, Prose- A, Dialogue- A+, Romance- A, Action- A, Plot- A+.     This is a great book in a wonderful series, things heat up and plots get even more interesting with the addition of new characters and the return of at least one dead one!     The only real negative for me is the lack of action thought-out the series, more combat would heighten the story, especial since this is a story of knights and civil war.     This Series, \\"Song of Fire ad Ice,\\" is by far the best modern fantasy written today, period! In a rich and vibrant fantasy world, George R. R. Martin, creates a complex and intricate story of war, intrigue, and betrayal that is similar to the historical War of the Roses, but only much grander, and vastly more compelling.     The story has something for everyone, mystery, romance, and action, but even more it creates a reality that is believable, with characters that seem real to live, some you like, some you loath, but all wonderfully interesting!       Main Characters:     Bran Stark: very likable young guy, has a thing for dire wolves, a shaman in training?  Jon Snow: warrior hero and all around good guy.   Ser Jaime Lannister: \\"The King Slayer,\\" arrogant, amoral, reckless, but very amusing, and possibly finding his soul!   Cersei Lannister: \\"The Queen Regent,\\" ambitious, willful, conniving, promiscuous, and deviously wicked, a character you love to hate.   Tyrion Lannister: \\"The Dwarf,\\" shrewd, educated, and calculating, but with a hart [and tounge] that gets him into trouble.   Lord Petyr Baelish: called \\"Littlefinger,\\" a devious snake [?], and master manipulator!   Daenerys Targaryen: the dragon Queen, too nice but learning.   Brienne: the Maid of Tarth, an ugly warrior girl.   Sansa Stark: unfortunately a very boring character.  Arya Stark: dull and unlikable, who's going in a strange and too dark plot line.  Samwell Tarrly: fat Sam of the Night Watch, likable, intelligent, and caring, what's he doing in this story!   Victarion Greyjoy: \\"The Iron Captain,\\" Reaver ot the seas. Dull so far, but less so than his brothers, his character has lots of potential.   Arianne Martell: beautiful, hot blooded, sexy, she is new to this book and really spices up the story! Her cousins the Sand Snakes need a greater role, hot chicks that like to kill, wow!      There is some violence, yet is no more than many comparable works, less than \\"The Return of the King,\\" by JRRT, and it certainly fits into a medieval fantasy war story.     The sexual content touches on adult themes, but it is not anywhere as graphic as most aimed at an adult audience, anyone over the age of 16 should be able to handle this book. In fact the most disturbing sexual content in books 1 thru 4 is a retelling of an event that happens years before the events of the story.     p.s. Soon to be an HBO series, they bought the rights, hopefully we will be able to watch these characters before too long!
B000NA28IE|2.0|A fantasy movie, dragons, horses, beautiful-breathtaking landscape, scarey guys, and a good storyline, what could be better?  (The book.)  After the novel, the thrill of a movie was a fun notion. Not one of us could hardly wait to see it.  Much to our dismay, the movie could not capture the magic the book has and what the author granted the reader, sadly.  What could have been - was not.  The movie is worth one watch, but for those of us who have read the book(s), look out.  Vital elements were left out, which lost parts of a truer storyline that is...  This is unfortunate for the actors who tried to do a good job despite the weak storyline proffered up.  The cinematography was gorgeous, what there was of it, and the CGI was ok.  Our passion being our horses, we would have liked to have seen a more appealing dragon, Saphiras' scales gleam and her eyes bigger and with more expression.  I suppose they were trying to follow her look on the book, although it was still surprising she is quite plain looking in the movie, and also that the personality that she possess in the book is not revealed in the movie much, sadly.  What was a true startle moreso was the voice used for Saphira!  Big mistake.  Our expectations were much too high regarding Saphira I suppose.  Who does not want to be in love with a dragon or revel in the thought of having one, much less riding one?  This was not to be so in the movie.  As far as the Eragon character himself, I was left with an attitude of neither here nor there with him, and really never felt anything much for any of the characters, and that left a hollow-empty spot that is not usually common, especially with this type of movie.. *sigh.  Eragon the movie is not that long, and adding a half an hour more to have allowed for the magic the author intended may have been well worth it.<br /><br />Also, for those who undoubtably feel this story follows the Star Wars storyline,... oh well.  So what if it has that feel, that was not such a bad story, now was it?  I happen to be a huge fan, and am a good fan of Eragon too, -  the book that is. I highly recommend the book(s) Eragon (and Eldest) for fun fantasy reading.

B000NA2776|5.0|I first heard Mika's work on a Verizon Wireless commercial in which Verizon advertised a few of their latest cell phone models to the tune of his song \\"Love Today\\" and was very impressed with the track. As the result, I found it only imperative to get my mitts on his album for myself and recently had the good fortune to find it a couple days ago. Needless to say, I made a wise choice to invest in this emerging artist's talent, and even after listening to this CD only three times already, I can agree with Vanity Fair in proclaiming that this guy's \\"destined for pop stardom.\\" <br /> <br />Inspired by the music of the last three decades of the twentieth century as well as by a touch of his own experience in opera, Mika demonstrates his mastery of the piano and the sung word in twelve original songs that eclectically reflect the quirkiness of 1990s alternative rock, the upbeat rhythm of 1980s New Wave, and--most notably--the readily recognized authenticity of 1970s pop rock and disco. Starting things off right with his #1 international hit \\"Grace Kelly\\" and concluding with the ironically sad and defeated tune of \\"Happy Ending,\\" this gifted up-and-comer from Great Britain covers the span of human emotions from confusion and frustration to dejection and remorse to elation and admiration. Some particular tracks I'd recommend include \\"Love Today,\\" of course, for its energy and groove-happy beat; \\"Billy Brown\\" for its offbeat story of an ordinary guy who ends up living a way of life for which the listener can't help but pity him for; \\"Lollipop\\" for its catchy instrumental and vocal arrangement; and \\"Any Other World\\" for its message of hope for a better life in a kinder, gentler world than the one we now live in following our crossing over into the Afterlife. \\"Relax (Take It Easy)\\" is another splendid song for its utilization of the introductory tune from Nicholas Eede's Cutting Crew hit \\"(I Just) Died In Your Arms\\" and its reminiscence of the vocal mastery of the Brothers Gibb, and \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" reminds us all that full-figured and overweight women can be just as admirable creatures as their more svelte counterparts any day of the week (just as all REAL men know for a fact). Heck, even the artwork for this album's inserts and front and rear covers begs to be mentioned for how it catches buyers' attention and encourages them to pick the CD up off the store shelf and bring it up to the register. Overall, this is one album that one can become accepting of--if not addicted to--in little time at all. <br /> <br />As is true with many already established pop musicians like Moby, Mika's sound is guided by the success of the legends of the most previous three decades, yet is also original enough to reflect his own creative genius. To translate, he's not just an entertainer; he's a true-blue artist who's bound to make a big splash in the sea of twenty-first century pop culture. To hate Mika is to hate music period, and anyone who bashes this rising pop star's expertise in the art or otherwise shies away from Life in Cartoon Motion is only doing himself or herself a grave disservice in the end. Therefore, do yourselves a favor, ladies and gentlemen: Buy this album. You'll thank yourselves for the investment and for supporting yet another great pioneer of modern music.
B00009V7P8|5.0|One listen to Blower's Daughter and you'll be hooked.  I simply can not get enough of his music.
B000NA28IE|2.0|This flick could have been SO much better. It almost seemed like the producers were rushing into production. Compared to the book this movie comes off as a made-for-tv special, except then they could have made it into a mini-series and done much better. Events and characters are mixed up so much so you don't get a good feel for the story.
B000GT4H0Y|1.0|I could plainly see that the action scenes were done in front of a green screen and I could tell exactly when there were 3D animations used.  It was that bad.  It definitely was not seemless.  Milla Jovovich was probably the worst actor for the lead roll.  She could not pull off that tough woman act.  Her acting was over-exaggerated (badly) and it was trying too much to be the matrix and Aeon Flux.  The acting was terrible by most of the actors and the actions scenes were so fake that it was unenjoyable.  I am currently watching the scene where she is talking to the little boy as he stands on the rail.  Wow!  What horrible acting!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Great hi def picture and great movie the answer to the double \\"007\\"
1582701709|5.0|I read many of the posted reviews before I bought the audible version of this book and downloaded it to my ipod.  The one thing I wanted to mention in my review refers to another review where the person writing the review was put off by how the author described applying The Secret to how you view weightloss and food. I have to admit, the first time I heard this, I would have had to agree with the other reviewer.   <br /> <br />However, after listening a couple times, and letting it sink in, and start working, things started changing for me. Some of the things I want in my life are health and perfect weight.  After I truly believed that those things were already mine, and thought, why not me?  I began to attract to me the information that made more of an impression on me than I had previously found...before I really believed it was possible to have my perfect weight.  Since then, I attracted to me the type of excercise program that is perfect for me and has become a way of life for me that I enjoy, and a way of healthful eating that I am convinced is necessary.  I attracted the philosophy to me that worked for me.  What I wanted came almost effortlessly.  I wasn't sitting around thinking, how in the world am I going to do this? But I believed that it was mine.  That is the key.  This came to me not because someone told me that it must be this way to have my perfect weight, but because I attracted it to me, it was exactly what I needed to reach my goal, and it literally came to me when I didn't think I was looking for it.  It was the power of attraction. <br /> <br />I think that what the author described worked for her, and with her thoughts she attracted to her what she wanted and she got it in her own way.  The same type of thoughts may work for you, or may not. Everyone's experience is different of course, but one thing certain is the power of attraction.  You will find that what you want will come to you if you believe it's yours.  Don't be put off by other people's ideas of what's right and what's wrong in creating your own life.  Unfortunately, that is most likely what's been holding you back in the first place.  I recommend that if you listen to the audible version of this book, especially if you listen frequently, you will be amazed at the positive results that will come to you...if you listen with an open and positive attitude. You see other people getting what they want out of life.  Why not you?

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Crream's triumphant return is brilliantly filmed during their week in Albert Hall.  The sound quality and photography is first rate, and the images are well-timed and skillfully directed. <br /> <br />The band itself is in top form and shows its musical age and experience brilliantly.  Eric Clapton's guitar playing is as good as you will see or hear anywhere.  Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker still are an exciting and stimulating rhythm section, and, in fact, Bruce does his famous duelling with Clapton on some of the numbers here.  We see it especially in Sunshine of Your Love.  Bruce and Clapton, despite their ages, still manage to sing their numbers with the same kind of verve as they did almost 40 years prior. <br /> <br />Of special interest here is the lack of gimmickry.  There are no wah-wah pedals, for example, and no real distortion feedback effects.  Stilll, the DVD has much to keep up the interest of the Cream fan who watches it.  <br /> <br />No DVD of a live performance is perfect, and there are few but notable letdowns here.  For instance, they include the witty but musically weak \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\"  from the Wheels of Fire collection.  The version of \\"Toad\\" here is rather long, and I'm not a fan of drawn-out drum solos, although Baker is amazingly energetic in this one.  <br /> <br />Still, for any Cream fans out there, this is a fine DVD to have.  You probably won't watch this just once!
0307341542|4.0|This was one of those books that my husbands hates.  Why?  Because when he comes home there is no dinner ready due to the fact that I was immersed in the world of the book and forgot what time it was.<br /><br /> It is dark.  It is a bit creepy. It left me with the feeling like a pulled tooth, a little hollow place, a bit painful.  I kept worrying at the ideas it left in my brain.<br /><br /> I would have given it five stars except that I found the ending a bit abrupt. Almost as if at the end, with a burst of speed, the writer decided the book needed to be over.  Still, an excellent read.  Enjoy.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|A absolute gem of a film! Simply put....it's just brilliant. It is the best 007 film since \\"Octopussy\\" in 1983 and arguably the best ever. Daniel Craig is clearly the best Bond since Sean Connery and silenced all detractors with a commanding and decisive performance. A must have for any 007 enthusiast or anyone else who can appreciate a fine film.
0060825219|1.0|We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read.
B000MM0L2S|2.0|This CD was a real disappointment. It was contrived by using famous names to sing songs that should have been orchestred pieces. Yo-Yo-Ma-Plays-Ennio-Morricone was superb and I had expected some of the same quality which is not there.

B00005JN4H|1.0|Wow, histerical.  Another black-meets-white comedy, full of ridiculously cliched jokes and plotlines.  This movie is so lame, the writer should've punched himself in the face the moment he even considered it.  Bang your head against a wall for 2 hours rather than subject yourself to this crapfest.
075640407X|5.0|In \\"Name of the Wind\\", Rothfuss takes a rather typical fantasy plot - boy grows up, becomes hero - and complicates it. His novel centers around the character Kvothe, who at the \\"present\\" time is a grown man reflecting on his childhood and attendance at a magical academy in his youth. The story alternates between the present and the past, and there is clearly indication that Kvothe is both an unreliable narrator as well as omitting certain details.     Rothfuss is generally pretty good when it comes to characterizing Kvothe. Although he gives him brains and some talent for singing and acting (before being orphaned, he was in a mobile acting troupe of sorts), Kvothe doesn't get any easy breaks. His childhood and orphanhood is fairly rough, and Rothfuss always makes sure to mention that money is a perpetual problem for him.     Most of the story is interesting as well. Rothfuss put the time into creating a coherent magical system, and the plot seems to flow naturally in most cases from Kvothe's actions.     The main problem is that Rothfuss's characterization of most of the other characters in the story is rather weak. Most characters in it lean towards stereotypes, like the \\"rich brat\\" who resembles a simplistic Draco Malfoy from \\"Harry Potter\\", or Kvothe's strange female friend. This isn't helped by his second major problem, which is the ending. Rothfuss includes a long ending sequence that drags considerably, and which has little practical effect on the story.    Regardless, it is still quite an excellent fantasy novel to read. I recommend it to all potential readers of fantasy.
B00005JPMX|3.0|I was a huge fan of the 80's TMNT cartoon and then the movies but not a fan of the new TMNT cartoons. <br /> <br />Now the TMNT have come back to the big screen in 3D CGI. I wondered how this would turn out, so I took my niece to see it who I don't think thought it was all that great either. <br /> <br />The graphics looked good, after I got past how big the Turtles hands looked and got used to the look.... but from my understanding this movie was supposed to go back to the roots of the comics where it was a much darker feel to it... but nope, it isn't even a new start as I thought it might... it's pretty much TMNT 4! Shredder is mentioned for a brief second at the beginning of the film, but also later hinted at for a sequel. <br /> <br />PLOT: Leonardo has left the Turtles to go to South America somewhere to further his training or something, so the other 3 Turtles are pretty much out of work and bored with there lives... Donatello is an IT consultant, Mikey is dressing up as a Big turtle clown for parties and Raph has become a secret avenger by night in a shredder kind of outfit as a vigilante that he doesn't let the other turtles know about.  <br /> <br />April O'Neil (looked too anomie imo)find's Leonardo in South America helping out a village as an unseen protector kind of thing but soon finds his way going home to New York to take lead of the brothers again while still feuding with Raph over leadership.  <br /> <br />Also, 3000 years ago something happened that left this guy immortal and turned his generals into stone, so they, with the help of the foot in present day are looking for 13 monsters so they are not immortal anymore... i dunno what it was all about really, it was kind of confusing... but it was kinda like the end plot to 13 ghosts. <br /> <br />Casey Jones also returns, but if kind of, i dunno, just not the right look for him or speech, both him and April just didn't feel right, i dunno, maybe you can get used to it, but they just looked too out ofplace.  <br /> <br />The plot as I said had a bit of confusion, plus, it didn't have the shell kicking it needed or smartness to it, it was all kind of too fast paces and needed a better ending. <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong, thats just what i thought, and i'm not saying its a bad movie, im just saying the original fans might find it a bit out of place in certain parts.  <br /> <br />oh well, see yas at the sequel.   <br /> <br />
B000N3ST8O|5.0|As always, Stevie never disappoints her true fans. This selection she has picked are great, but anything she ever writes, and or sings are great anyway. Some may say, they already have these songs. It's not the same, it's a new CD and DVD, which only a true fan can understand, \\"if you read between my lines\\". I only hope she will still release more new songs.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Got this movie last Christmas since my parents and I have to purchase new cars last June.  I decided that I should have this movie too which reminded of last June.  To all NASCAR fans it is also perfect since it begins with auto racing.  Movie also had a bit education which talked about US 66 out west from the past to present.  Movie was also scenic which took out on a scenic drive through the desert, the forest, and river.  Bonuses were also interesting too which feature real pictures of the old cars of the past including the Hudson Hornet.  Here I had a bit of fun watching this movie since it reminded of a vacation.  Therefore for families and children this would a perfect roadtrip during the cold winter.
B000294SFW|5.0|Before I start on this cd Iam new to Motorhead I started with the Ace of Spades and Overkill. <br />   <br />     This album in my opinion has 8 great classic songs on it. <br /> <br />Terminal show,Killers, In the name of tragedy, Suicide, In the Black, Fight, In the year of the wolf, and Whorehouse Blues  are all 5 star tracks <br /> <br />the others non mentioned are 4 star tracks which are enjoyable to listen to but not as much as those 8  <br /> <br />8/12 tracks being great on that album makes it a 5 star album
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Anyone with a best friend should have this movie. All the people in Fried Green Tomatoes played their parts with great enthusiasm and with heart. Staying close to the book by Fannie Flagg it focuses on Idgie and Ruth, as well as Evelyn and Ninny, showing how friendship blossoms and stays strong through out the years. The cast is sterling - No one could have played the part other than Jessica Tandy as Ninny, an elderly lady in a nursing home that brings her humor and stories to a sad candy-consumming middle age Evelyn Couch, played brilliantly by Kathy Bates. The two strike a friendship as Ninny relates the story of Idgie Threadgood (played by Mary Stuart Masterson) and her family as well as her unique friendship with Ruth Jamison (played by Mary Louise Parker). Cicely Tyson does an excellent job as Sipsey, a woman who is a cook at the cafe in Whistle Stop. There is romance, intrigue, murder, and suspense as well subtle and explicit humor. Having this movie brings parts that weren't even in the original movie or in the first video or dvd. I am glad I waited to get the extended version and plan on sharing it with MY best friend. The setting for the story is beautiful and no one should miss watching the Bonus Material as they describe how a town they chose for the movie was almost a ghost town but they brightened it up and more people have chose to live there now. You will laugh, you will cry, but you will also understand what life is all about...friends...best friends.
0131479415|5.0|This is such a great book for reading and re-reading. I find new nuggets of information each time I go back to it. If I get stuck, or a situation arises, I know I can turn to this book for my answer. It took me a bit to get into this book the first time. I think it was because I thought his first book [[ASIN:0321205685 User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development (The Addison-Wesley Signature Series)]]was so darn good. What could Mike possibly add to that piece of work? Well, a lot. Every team should have this book available for consultation. It is the next best thing to having Mike there in person!

0792846443|5.0|So many of Kings stories are turned into really bad movies that when it's done right like The Dead Zone, Misery and The Shawshank Redemption( I know there are some other good ones)you wonder what went wrong with the others. This is a high tension thriller that will keep you on the edge from beginning to end! Bates is incredible in her role as the Nut from Hell!
B000MNP2KI|2.0|When a formula works, you really should stick with it.  The team behind Casino Royale obviously decided to move in a new direction, abandoning key elements of the formula: debonair Bonds, drop dead gorgeous vixens, and incomparable special effects.  Let's start with Daniel Craig.  He just doesn't have it.  He looks too old (this story is supposed to occur early in Bond's career).  His stockiness kills any hope for a fashion sense.  Still, a great actor can overcome these shortcomings to look like a hero (like Tobey Maquire did with Spiderman).  Not Craig.  This man cannot act.  He has a total of two looks in the movie:  a poker face and a constipated canary face.  The later he uses to woo women and to stare down villains.  Apparently, that looked took a lot of work since even it disappeared in the second half of the movie leaving us with a blank poker face. <br /> <br />I guess to keep with a somewhat ugly Bond (whose most notable feature are his satellite dish ears), the producers decided to cast more down to earth females.  I never imagined seeing ladies like this in a Bond movie.  I thought I was watching The Facts of Life.  As for the special effects...they started off good, but just faded into ordinary low budget action thriller effects.   <br /> <br />In short, it was disappointing.  BTW, I won't delve into the lack of continuity of the movie (when compared to other Bond films) as this seems to be a common problem with these movies.
6305949980|4.0|This movie is a visual treat! Tim Burton can certainly come up with all the visual elements in a film, but he lacks in his story telling sometimes. The music in this film is mediocre at best and is one of it's biggest flaws. Please don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it is not one of the greatest movie ever made as many have claimed. The music is boring and drags sometimes especially if you copmpare it to 'James and the Giant Peach' where the songs are very good and drive the film. \\"James\\" is much more entertaining on a story level too. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a beautiful looking film and has great characters, it also has fantastic animation and who doesn't love monsters?, but it just doesn't quite live up to the cult status it has achieved.
B000000WG4|5.0|This is the perfect cd for long trips. Though there's only two tracks, they go for a long time. This is the complete theme to The Exorcist and is worth listening to.

I would have liked it if each picture   was labeled with the emotion/idea being expressed... <br /> <br />Other than that...i highly recomend this book...especially if you are or are learning to be  a cartoonists/Caricature artist...
B000MV9026|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE REVIEWS ARE TALKING ABOUT.  THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.  SO UPLIFTING WITH THE MUSIC, MY CHILDREN WERE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE.  AS FOR THE UNDERTONES, WHAT MOVIE THIS DAY DOES NOT HAVE AN UNDERTONE, AND THE WHOLE THING ABOUT MAN BEING BAD FOR RUINING THE PENGUINS FOOD SUPPLY WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.  YES, WE AS MANKIND CAN WRECK ANIMALS HABITATS, THATS NOTHING NEW AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED, AND ITS ONLY US, THE ADULTS THAT REALLY CATCH ON TO IT.  AS FOR MUMBLES BEING GAY, THATS RIDICULOUS.  IT TEACHES A VALUABLE LESSON ABOUT BEING DIFFERENT.  MY 5 YR OLD ACTUALLY THOUGH MUMBLES WAS SO BRAVE, AND HE'S RIGHT, HE WAS.  MY SON GOT NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS FROM THIS MOVIE, I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT, FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS ADULTS.  I ADORE THIS MOVIE.  GOOD BUY !!!!!
B0001MDP3G|1.0|It should be rated X in the first place. It was like walking in slow motion. The ending was just not great. I hated this movie. Who wants to see people eat rotting cows and then be thrown into an orgy?
B00000K19E|4.0|While I can certainly appreciate the Brothers' attempt to bring a masterpiece to live action film, and ultimately, the masses - I don't really care for some of their changes.      The actors, especially, could have been better chosen.  Aside from the new addition, Neo, I don't think any of the characters lived up to their animated counter-parts - particularly 'Trinity'.  Although she does look quite a bit like the Major in the original movie, her acting is nothing to write home about and she only came off as trying way too hard.    As for the story, considering the sources, it ended up dumbed-down and convoluted.  Something that needed to happen, I suppose, for it's mainstream success; but for those of us with expectations. . . disappointing.    If the film were a stand-alone, it may have been better off.  But given the history of what it tried to imitate, it ended up lacking in some areas.    But again, I appreciate the attempt.  So, 3 stars for effort (which I am grateful for, no matter how botched), and a star for visual execution.    Definitely worth seeing.  But, do yourself a favor and have a look at the original sources on which The Matrix is based.
B00099BJ48|5.0|is good in this movie.He is a great actor and was extremely believable! The movie brings back all those times you look like an idiot in front of the one you are trying to impress and they still like you!
B000JVT1U0|5.0|It is difficult to say just what it is about this film that makes it so haunting. Great script, yes. great cast, yes, great soundtrack, yes, unusual and striking location, yes but there is some additional quality over and above all of these that seems to go deep into viewer at a level below the rational mind, something atavistic. Victor Burgin has written about the way that certain sequences of images in films can implant themselves in our memories and subconscious much more strongly than the narratives of which they were originally part. I would argue that The Wicker Man is unusally rich in such image sequences. The animal masks, the gathering of the villagers, the seacliffs at twilight, the caves; somehow we are being reminded of something deep in human history, the long millennia before civilisation, that even yet remains imprinted or \\"hard wired\\" into us, (like our fear of spiders and snakes}.  <br /> <br />There is also something very captivating about the location filming. The local shop may have pagan fetishes for sale but also seems to have a good stock of cheap stationary, pencils and plastic sharpeners! And where else would your pagan housewife go to be fitted with her bird mask than the local hairdressers, complete with tatty looking 1960s style hairdryers? So I think there is this quality to the film as well, the quality of a remembered dream where mundane and bizarre elements coexist. The description \\"cinema fantastique\\" is a good one; The Wicker Man remains unique.
0689815816|5.0|Kids of most ages will love this one.  Apparantly based on a \\"campfire\\" chat that I was not previously familiar with, this books presents a great story told in lyric about an unlikely bear hunt.  As fun as the story is, the pictures are 'cute' and attractive for kids and their readers.  I have seen this in both board book format (wth all of the advantages of that slobber-tolerant medium) and full size 'big picture' format.  I recommend the latter if you can find it, for enjoyment of the artwork.
B000FSME1A|1.0|I purchased this film having been one of the few Americans to have never Apocolyse Now.  I am very disappointed, it is extremely overrated and was over two hours of my life that I will never get back.  Not that filling out reviews on Amazon isn't a waste of time either, but the film was way too long with an anti-climactic ending.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Will he ever make an album that dissapoints me.  Hes simply amasing.  Definatly the best artist to listen to when you wanna just chill.  The song Gravity is the best on the cd.  Really bluesy i love it.

B000IAZPKM|5.0|Kamelot fans who are familiar with the bands previous live album \\"The Expedition\\" are no strangers to Kahn's ability to reproduce quality vocals on stage.  If you like Kamelot's \\"Epica\\" and \\"The Black Halo\\" (which, in my humble opinion, are two of Kamelot's greatest CD's) then this is a must buy.  The visuals on this DVD are also very good but i think the selling point here is the music.  Simply wonderful

B000MTPANQ|5.0|The second release from the Archives Series is Neil Young, alone, playing acoustic guitar and piano and singing his heart out to his native Canadian audience. This release is suprisingly accessable for a Neil Young record, and I would recommend it for those who are just getting into his music. Neil rarely sounded as good and the song selection is terrific. <br /> <br />Since his move to the states in the previous decade, Neil already had some success with the Springfield, had released a fantastic rock album and had toured with the Horse and had released some early solo albums, growing in stature with each year, the unique singer songwriter was on the verge of superstardom that would come with the release of his \\"Harvest\\" album. <br /> <br />Had Neil released these performances as a live album, instead of Harvest, which could have occured, who knows how Neils musical path would have continued from 1971.  <br /> <br />These performances are nothing short of brilliant and I enjoy this side of Neil over the Live at the Fillmore from the previous year. There is actual footage, albeit shakey, on the DVD componant which is an improvement from The Fillmore release. <br /> <br />The audience finds Neil in perhaps the prime of his vocal abilities and listening to his then new songs such as \\"Old Man\\" and \\"Heart of Gold\\", which were to become great hits for him, in the early stages, this is important historically to Neil fans and quite interesting too. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" is one of my favourite Young songs from the early 70's is a real highlight. Other tracks that standout for me are \\"On The Way Home\\" which opens the show and an appropriate choice of song in \\"Journey through the Past\\". \\"Bad Fog of Lonliness\\", the lost gem can also be found here. 2 Crazy Horse rockers \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" are reinterpreted by Young is shorter and equally passionate acoutsic versions. \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" comes of great live, this offcourse releasedby a Youngless Horse back in the day. <br /> <br />This release is a must have. It is interesting from a historical point of view, contains passionate and brilliantly performed songs and is Neil Young at his most accessable, laid back and in the early stages of his prime. <br /> <br />
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar has done it again! <br /> <br />This is a great family-friendly movie that all ages will find hilarious, witty, and clever.
B000IY06CK|5.0|I heard Fischer life in Bratislava and decided to buy this CD. Her performance was marvellous, although the orchestral accompaniment was less than on this CD. Her fabulous technique is completely for the use of her great, authentic performance and she is in an phenomenal way accompanied by Yakov Kreizberg. My first predeliction for this concerto was Leonid Kogan's performance in the sixties and I had the same experience listening to Fischer's. This concerto makes high demands upon the performers to give a unified performance, but they really succeed. <br />A most recommendable CD. <br />
B000AOEMXM|4.0|The previous reviews of the Enterprise series are accurate and fair.  The writing was at times weak, but the show's concepts were so brilliant and the acting so well done that it overcame the weak scripts and turned the strong scripts into some of the best Star Trek television episodes in history.    The two episodes focusing on the Vulcan civil war rank as among the strongest in the series, not only telling an important part of the Star Trek canon, but doing so with especially good acting.  It explained well the variance of the Vulcan characters' duplicity with the straight honesty of the Vulcans of Spocks' era.  Indeed, Spock represented the Vulcans who ultimately won the civil war and abolished the corrupt Vulcan High Command.    Not often mentioned directly, but poignant for me, were the two episodes focusing on the Terra Prime terror group.  For me, the interaction of the clone infant and the T'Pol character was some of the most well acted portions of the series.  It wasn't the typical mother/infant interaction, but it bridged a gap between the cultural differences of Vulcans while also providing a glimpse of the underlying similarities of the human and Vulcan races.  The final scene of Trip and T'Pol standing by their dying daughter was a particularly poignant moment that needed a strong expansion in the series finale.    Speaking of the finale, the dessert was particularly unappealing.  The series finale was so horrible and mangled that it will endure as a low point in the entire history of the Star Trek industry.  The Enterprise ensemble cast did their best to polish a shoddy script, but could only do so much.    The series deserved to end with a series entirely devoted to the cast.  A story set at the time of the Enterprise NX-01 decommissioning was perfect.  It should have been a series of ensemble cast memories played out in a script of the sadness of seeing \\"the old girl\\" put out to pasture.  The Archer speech at the founding of the Federation of Planetsshould have been given a full weight of the speech laid before us.    T'Pol and Trip should have had a bittersweet ending of their crew association, with a final answer on whether or not they were going to endure as a Vulcan/Human couple.  Trip's death was a distraction, not central to the theme, and horrible disjointed.  It is a bitter fruit for all Star Trek fans who liked this series -- and there were many who did.    The series finale almost seemed to be the two original producers getting together and serving up a poison pill for Paramount to consume.  It was anything but a valentine.  It's true indication of bitterness is the fact that not a single primary actor in the series has supported the script, and all who have commented have provided bitter recriminations.    Blaylock, Bacula, and Trinneer have all offered blunt honest negative assessments.  These views are accurate.    People who will likely purchase this DVD collection are fans of the series, and don't need a review to make a purchasing decision.  However for those few who did not see the series I highly encourage you to purchase the collection.  All four seasons contain nuggets of beautiful scripts and excellent acting.  It should be enjoyed in sum as a series that boldly went in a direction where many mistakes were made by the characters in trying to form the rules for future crews.
B00005JLEU|5.0|After watching the first two films, a good friend of mine suggested that I rent Spirited Away, and indeed I rented the film from netflix.  I never regretted it since!  My god, I was instantly addicted to this third film I ever watched!  Ever since, I did a research and watched all the extensive films he ever made and watched them all!  You will not regret watching this, and if you did, you have really a bad taste!
B000MTDRKE|5.0|For people to give this album a \\"1-star\\" rating based solely on the lyrical content is absolutely ridiculous, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Neal could sing about flying elephants and circus freaks, and the musical content alone would still be worth at least 3-stars. <br /> <br />I can understand, though, why people may be offended by the lyrics. While I do listen to a wide variety of music (in my review of \\"?\\" I stated how I listen to Pagans Mind, which may seem ironic being that I am a Christian) and have a very open mind, I would most likely be offended by Slayer's lyrics, although I have never listened to them. <br /> <br />Enough of that stuff...after listening to Sola Scriptura about 4-times, I am ranking it right up there with some of Neal's best efforts with Spock's Beard/Transatlantic/his other solo efforts. I keep waiting for a dissapointing album from Neal. After all, how can one artist continue to put out high-quality material time and time again, especially when most of the previous material is outstanding, and seen as perhaps his crowning achievement? There has to be a drop-off at some point, right?? <br /> <br />Well, it didn't happen with Sola Scriptura, and hopefully won't ever happen. I absoulutely love the hard edge that Gillis brings to this album, in spots. Neal continues to come out with music that never seems to disapoint, never gets old, and always has something a little new to feast your ears on. This album is an absolute joy to listen to, and I highly recommend it to fans of all different styles of music.
0316172324|3.0|Not nearly as good as the tipping point and a little too 'technical' at some points.  It took me almost twice as long to get through this book as it does most books that are of equal size.  Nonetheless I still think it was an interesting read, it just would fall lower on my list of things to read over again.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Wow, Children of Men begins in a bleak future and, for most part, gets bleaker as it goes. There is a disconcerting realism to it, as if this world exists right now. Rarely are there special effects or technology to amuse us. There's a little bit, but for the most part the filmmaker presents a world just like ours, only worse in tangible ways. I thought the constant hurdles and quick twists of fortune thrown up in the main characters faces were terribly realistic at the same time as they're surprising. Clive Owen is convincing as the pained, alchololic protagonist.  Now, if all that sounds depressing... it is. But this film is good both because it does justice to an examination of the possibility that the future may not be brighter than the past, and because as the film progresses people do rise to the struggle in wonderful ways. The hope of continued life and longing for what children mean to the world infuses this with possibility. It's a very good film. I just read the description of the book, which seemed quite different in some ways. But in any event Alfonso Cuaron has created a full-realized work here. Recommended.
B000MV9026|4.0|Happy feet started out strong, a penguin who doesn't fit in uses his special ability to overcome adversity.  Nice plot line.  Halfway into the film I was trying to understand how it beat out Cars - arguably Pixar's best effort yet - for best animated feature.  Once I saw the environmentalist conclusion then I understood. <br /> <br />Nice CGI, again not as good as Cars.  Felt like it was longer than it needed to be.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Brandi Carlile faces a dilemma and I bet she knows it. She's a little bit alternative, a little bit folk and a little bit country. This pretty much guarantees that mainstream radio, with it's segregated programming and lack of imagination, will probably ignore her. While she's certainly young and cute enough, she does'nt gyrate on stage and croon about her bedroom which means MTV will have no use for her either. Well, radio aand MTV's loss is our gain because Brandi Carlile might just have the most expressive and beautiful voice I've heard in a long time. I was blown away by the first song I heard from this album on a free sampler CD. It was the title track \\"The Story\\". What impressed me was Brandi's sudden launch into a harder edged rock sound, her powerful vocals almost cathartic. I was curious and maybe a bit apprehensive about whether the entire album would have the same sound. Well, I should have known better. Brandi is NOT one dimensional. This new CD picks up where her debut left off. It alternates between heartfelt ballads, Americana and midtempo rock (\\"Cannonball\\" being a particular favorite). The copyright dates on the songs are from 2001 through 2006 so this may be a collection of road-tested \\"trunk songs\\" i.e. songs Brandi and the twins have been playing live for a long time now. Regardless, Brandi Carlile can sing the birds out of the trees. Honestly, her voice is so mesmerizing and her use of it so artful that you have to wonder why she's not the top selling female artist in the country. As evidenced by the strength of her two CD's, I'd say Brandi's got a long and legendary career ahead of her.   <br />Now I know what you're thinking, why not 5 stars then? Well look.... I'd give REVOLVER 5 stars...I'd give PET SOUNDS 5 stars, know what I mean?
B00005JPKE|5.0|This film blows away all the stereotypes that Americans have been fed over the last half-century about the Japanese.  Yes, Clint Eastwood is an American director.  But the film \\"feels\\" Japanese, and it's not only because, with the exception of just a scene or two, it is entirely in the Japanese language.  It's because the Japanese deeply-held tradition of dying with honor is so clearly depicted, so much so that it was easy for me to understand and identify where they were coming from.<br /><br />The film opens in the present day, as a cache of letters is discovered and carefully dug up.  I understand that some of these letters really do exist and had been published recently in Japan.  These letters form the narrative structure of the film.  It works very well.<br /><br />The rest of the film takes place in 1944, and  here we get to meet a full spectrum of Japanese soldiers.  We identify with them.  We feel their suffering as they all realize that this is truly their last stand and that are all going to die.  There is hunger, there is fear, there is discipline.  And, most clearly, there are their individual reactions to what is going on around them.  Ken Watanabe is cast as the General.  Kazara Ninomiya is cast as a young soldier who yearns to return to his wife and baby daughter.  And then there are all the other men -- the officer who was once an Olympic equestrian and had visited America, the young man who was sent to the front because he was too softhearted to be in an elite troop, and all of those who chose suicide missions or death by their own hands over surrender.  It is a huge and sad story.  I am glad it has been finally told in its entirety.<br /><br />The battle of Iwo Jima was a decisive one.  The Americans sent 100,000 men to rout out the Japanese soldiers who saw Iwo Jima as a part of Japan and were defending the Island.  Seven thousand Americans died, 20,000 were wounded.  And of the 20,000 Japanese defending the Island, only about 1,000 of them survived. The film seems to be shot in black and white and so, in a way, it seems like a film that might have been made during those early war days.  However, this is the year 2007 and graphic artists have mastered the techniques of working with colors.  And so, the color saturation varies scene by scene.  Some of the scenes inside the caves seem to have a warm red glow.  And during the battle scenes, the flames erupt in bright yellows and orange.  Other times, the faces of the men are in shadow or half shadow.  All of this certainly enhanced the realism and the mood.<br /><br />\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is a masterpiece.  And yet, it is not for everybody.  The subtitles alone might dissuade some.  And inevitable sad ending will keep others away.  But students of history and human nature will applaud the genius of it all.  And a story that needed to be told is now available for world-wide audiences.to be shot in black and white and so, in a way, it seems like a film that might have been made during those early war days.

B000J103YI|3.0|I liked the first half of the movie, and its music.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel's impact resonates long after the film is over.  Scenes flash through my mind.  I'm disturbed and unsettled.  And I'm convinced that this film is a very special kind of art form.<br /><br />It's an ambitious undertaking.  There are four parallel stories and several languages including the sign language of a deaf mute young woman.  Cultures clash.  Misunderstandings happen.  It's just like the real world - only more up close and \\"in your face\\".  And, like the real world, the conclusion is not tidy and only leads to more questions.<br /><br />Bravo to the director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu for his skill in making these seemingly separate pieces all come together as one unified whole.  And bravo to the to actors who were nominated for Academy Awards for their supporting roles --  Adriana Barraza, cast as a Mexican caretaker of two American children and Rinko Kikuchi, cast as a young deaf mute Japanese schoolgirl.  Yes, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchard did bring the star power to this film, and they were indeed excellent as the American tourist couple who are stranded in a small Moroccan village after a stray bullet hits their tour bus and the wife is seriously wounded.<br /><br />No, it wasn't terrorists, although the media immediately picks up on the story.  The bullet came from the gun of a young Moroccan goatherd who was trying to see how far his gun could shoot.  We get to see the confusion created by this incident and the over-reactions of the Moroccan police.  There are other police actions that made me shudder as well, as mistakes add up and a car driven by the Mexican woman's nephew is detained by the U.S. Boarder Patrol.<br /><br />Another police incident concerns a young  Japanese police officer who the deaf mute young woman tries to seduce.  All this seems complex, but that is the point of the film.  Life is complex and disturbing and an action by one person can impact many others on the other side of the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, but it's certainly not light entertainment.  Just be forewarned.  This film is designed to be emotionally disturbing.ecommend this film, but it's certainly not light entertainment.  Just be forewarned.

B000HIVO64|5.0|This is easily Beck's most accessible album to date. Even Republicans will like it without knowing why. Try it sometime. The wonderful sounds will invade their central nervous systems while instilling strange libertarian ideals... By the time they realize what's happening to them it will be too late!!  : )<br /><br />P.S. It's worth it just for the bonus DVD alone, not to mention the cool stickers.<br /><br />P.P.S.

1582701709|5.0|After having viewed the Oprah Winfrey Show about The Secret, I decided to purchase and read the book for myself.  I found it to be quite inspirational, thought-provoking, and it made me do a great deal of soul-searching. Suddenly, many things became clear to me. It is not the type of book that one can just pick up and read from cover to cover in one sitting.  I found myself reading just a few pages at a time so that I could absorb all that was being written.  It has changed the way I perceive things and taught me to live my life in a different way.  In a sense, it has become my bible for living and I plan to re-read it many times over.  I would strongly recommend this book.
B000MV9026|5.0|I liked the movie but I'd wait for them to make the Happy Feet Special Edition DVD because there's barely any special features on this first one. They always seem to do this with movies that are this popular, they wait so many months then make this other one that has more features on it. And of course your kids are going to want this one too just because of the new features!!!! They do the same thing to all the Disney movies plus others like Titanic!!! About the real people they put in at the end, I don't think it's because they didn't have faith in making them CG. I think that because the Penguins looked so life-like that they thought it would look better if they used real people, because so far in CG of making people that it's the people that look more fake than anything else. Like the people in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and even Shrek just to name a few. Yes I said Shrek! Don't get me wrong I love the Shrek the movies but the people still don't look real enough.
1401907717|4.0|This is a really great book - Full of wonderful and inspiring messages from your Angels. I find it really helpful to read it in the morning as it gives me a message to remember and think about during the day. All the messages are positive and give you something to work on within your self, which is important. I really reconmend this for anyone who is interested in Angels.
1573228737|3.0|I'm struck by a few similar elements in Affinity and The Turn of the Screw. Sexual repression as it contributed to the female characters' malaise is the clearest.      Given Sarah Waters's great scholarship, the choice of Peter Quick's name was surely not coincidental but meant as a nod to Henry James's Peter Quint. Once tipped off, it's a short step to begin doubting the credibility, if not the sanity of the main female character.      Why as yet haven't any reviewers commented here on the steady and generous intake of opium (laudanum) and chloral hydrate (a hypnotic) that Miss Prior was accustomed to consuming? While she was most certainly blinded with love for Selina Dawes, her huge (medically prescribed) drug habit surely further distorted her perceptions and judgment about that lady.      Though it could have been shorter and tighter, you can read this story on political, social and psychological levels. What is not ambiguous, however, is the ending. The scam is very real.      Common threads running through Sarah Waters's first 3 books (haven't read the most recent yet) are betrayal and the abuse of power, woven into very different and clever entertainments.
1401907725|5.0|This oracle card set is really great. I have two of Doreen's card sets: This one and Messages from your Angels. This one however is far more accturate, and I find the readings very helpful. It's great to use in the morning, and by choosing one card to carry with you during the day, it's a good way of remembering your angels are watching over you, and the message they want you to have. I highly reconmend this set! <br />

B000ICL3KG|5.0|<br />This is not a bad movie.  It is just not a scientific movie. <br /> <br />Does anyone realize that not only did Al Gore invent the Internet, but that he also sat for the first professor that deduced the cause of global warming?  No one ever thinks about these things.   <br /> <br />According to this 1950's style scare documentary, he also sat right next to the snot nosed kid that figured out that the continents were drifting.  The teacher didn't believe the obnoxious child's wild claims, according to Al Gore, and thus the nice teacher became an early despised non-believer. <br /> <br />Rather than anyone wondering if there ever actually was such a child, with such a keen insight into continental drift, with a runny nose sitting next to the inventor of the Internet, many, many years ago, decades before anyone ever heard of plate tectonics - Al Gore immediately afterward tells us that because this snot nosed child was right about tectonic plates, that Al Gore's entire movie must be right. <br /> <br />An argument born directly from the ashes of Sir Isaac Newton's scientific method, clearly - not. <br /> <br />Al Gore is not a scientist after all!  He doesn't have to prove anything other than the fact that he really, really cares about the earth as seen from space, as clearly shown in this documentary. <br /> <br />If he were a scientist, he might have mentioned what impact that the arrival of 100,000,000 greedy new immigrants to the United States over the last few decades, has had on our rising CO2 emissions in the United States!  Without all these new immigrants, I believe that our CO2 emissions would actually be way, way less than they were in 1950. <br />
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Olive is a little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant.  Her family consists of a nerotic father, a gay uncle, a foul-mouthed grandfather, and a brother who has taken a vow of silence.  They pile into a VW van which has as many quirks as the family, and head off for California so that Olive can live out her dream.  There are over-the-top moments, some of which are funny and some of which are merely tasteless.  The most heartwarming moment in the film occurs when the family has a rare show of solidarity when they serve as back-up dancers for Olive, who is doing a dance number which was unfortunately choreographed by her grandfather.  Olive is a refreshing contrast to the Jon Benet Ramsey look-alikes she is competing against, but this movie was still a bit over-the-top for me.
B00005O3VD|5.0|This movie is beautiful and entertaining. I have seen it 8 times and never miss it when it is on TV. Omar is so gorgeous to look at and makes a perfect Nick. Barbra shows off her voice in many dimensions and proves what a great singer she is. Most of us did not grow up with Fanny Brice except on the radio so her life was a mystery. It always seemed funny but there was plenty of heartbreak. I know the producers took many liberties in depicting her life but I think we all get the gist.
1581804849|5.0|This book is awesome!  I have many of Donna's books but this is my favorite.  I've been painting using the One Stroke method for about 5 months and I'm HOOKED!  I've taken 13 classes with my local OSCI since then, which is the best way to improve your OS painting skills, but this book is a great compliment to those classes.  Donna uses about 15 pages in the beginning of the book to go over materials, techniques and colors.  Then she covers 50 flowers/blooms using 2 pages for each.  The picture of her finished piece is a full page and of course very colorful.  Then on the opposite page it lists the brushes and paints you'll need and a step by step guide on how to paint the flower(s).  But it doesn't stop there.  She uses 14 pages at the end to cover filler flowers and floral composition.  Finally the last 2 pages are a gallery of floral project ideas.  This is an invaluable resource!  Enjoy!
B000NA28I4|3.0|I had read the Book First.  I was disapointed with the movie because it left out a large portion of the story.  The graphics were excelent, but with the changes I missed, as anyone who sees the movie will, the personal development of the charactors.  There were some elements missing that would have an impact on the future episodes.<br /><br />I strongly recomend reading the book first, as well as the next 2 books.<br /><br />Eldest is out now. I am still waiting for the last book to be published.
0743496728|4.0|as someone who was unmercifully teased in school, this book hit home emotionally. The shooter is a young man who is also the victim of serial teasing and decides enough is enough. The writing is very well done, it brings you into each of the characters lives. Nothing is black and white there are shades of grey to everyones story...is the jock really perfect, what does it mean to be the popular girl?, the unpopular student? What about the nameless ones?<br /><br />The biggest problems I had with this book was the lack of explanation for the other two guns. Peter brings four guns to school, two rifls that is is shown he has knowledge of, yet he only uses the two pistols. This seems unrealisitic to me. aslo, like many other readers I had a feeling th ending was rushed and seemed to tie things up a little too tidy, but what happens with Peter is heartbreaking and I went back multiple times to read that section by itself.<br /><br />As for the reader who commented on the 9/11 mistakes, in reading it, the memories were just that, memories. ask anyone what they remember of that day and you will have differing accounts of the events as they happen. Even minutes after the plane struck the Pentagon people differed as to what struck it, so memory six years later is going to be hazy. It is a small mistake, but ultimately a forgiveable one.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play two women whose boyfriends have just broken up with them in order to be with another woman.  They both want to get away and manage to do this by swapping houses.  Diaz has a mansion in L.A. whereas Winslet lives in a quaint English cottage.  When they arrive at their vacation homes, they both find romance, but not without some complications.  Both women show a nice flair for comedy and they are both likeable heroines.  This is a pleasant movie which will probably appeal to the women in the audience more than to the men.
B000001EEN|5.0|I was there at the Rainbow Theatre the night this stunning concert was recorded, seventh row center, having queued up overnight for a ticket.  It was my first rock concert.  I have been to perhaps a hundred since and none has ever lived up to this mind-blowing lineup.  The support shown for Eric by his friends was evident all night and shines through still on this newly remastered album.
0792839730|4.0|This film adaptation of Cornelius Ryan's \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" brings the ensemble war movie approach made famous by the earlier movie \\"The Longest Day\\" to the heroic but flawed Allied offensive to seize a strategic crossing over the Rhine River in 1944.  The book and the movie portray World war II combat at every level, from the foxhole to the Allied and German general staffs. The movie features dozens of strong performances, including many cameos by name actors, in a nearly three hour movie.<br /><br />Operation Market-Garden was the brainchild of British Field Marshal Montgomery, but the push to execute the high risk operation in the face of last-minute conflicting intelligence came from an allied airborne army shown as a little too eager to get into the fight.  The American 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions dropped into Holland to open a way for British XXX Corps to reach a bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem.  Arnhem itself was the target of the British First Airborne Division and a Polish Parachute Brigade.  The movie captures both the heroic efforts of the British and Americans and their Dutch resistance allies to open the way, and the response by the German army to defeat the offensive short of the decisive bridge.  Dirk Bogarde, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Michael Caine, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Maximillian Schell, Hardy Kruger and Anthony Hopkins are just a few of the actors with pieces of the action.<br /><br />The movie is authentic-looking and well-executed, capturing the confusion of the fighting, the heroism of many individuals and units, and the crushing human cost of mistakes.  Highly recommended.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Having literally grown up together, 17-year-old Rory Gilmore and her 33-year-old mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.  <br /> <br />In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.  <br /> <br />Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.  <br /> <br />Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky \\"townie\\" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.  <br /> <br />In this season, Rory continues dating Dean, her first serious boyfriend, while fighting an attraction to Luke's bad-boy nephew Jess. Lorelai becomes engaged to Max, a teacher at Chilton. Emily wants Rory to participate in a debutante ball, and Lorelai and Sookie want to realize their dream of opening their own inn. <br /> <br />Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-) <br />

B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's self-titled first album, which also proved to be their breakthrough, is doubtlessly one of heavy metal's all-time most influential albums (with this release, Iron Maiden helped Judas Priest to plant the seeds for speed, thrash, and progressive metal.) It's also one of the finest debuts ever recorded by any band in the history of heavy metal. The band's vocals would become more memorable and expansive on later releases (especially after Bruce Dickinson replaced Paul Di'anno as singer in 1982), but musically, Iron Maiden were in top form on this 1980 album. There's just so much to enjoy on every one of these songs, and man, do they rock! They're fast, exciting, catchy, and super infectious. From front to back, this disc has palpable energy, irresistible hooks, impressive guitar work (including wailing solos)  from Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton, prominent bass notes, and bouncy, toe-tapping drum beats galore!<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Prowler,\\" which ties wah-wah guitar licks with bouncy riffs, strong bass work, and a great solo. After that, \\"Sanctuary\\" boasts a propulsive bass line (which is the main focal point of the song) and two wailing solos. \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" begins as a ballad (with restrained verses, a grumbling bass, and all kinds of guitar melodies and harmonies), but gains a great deal of momentum and speed and climaxes in a wide-open, majestically soaring and instantly memorable chorus. Next, \\"Running Three\\" is a faster number that's backed by a hooky, galloping rhythm and rhythmic, thumping drums. The record's crown jewel and fan favorite, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (which is an epic, multi-faceted and mostly instrumental piece that clocks in at over seven minutes long), and track seven, \\"Strange World,\\" both sport a wealth of great harmonies, a catchy rhythm, and numerous fantastic, ultra-clean and melodic guitar solos. \\"Transylvania,\\" a propulsive instrumental which features soaring guitar leads anchored by a beeping bass line, is another instant classic. \\"Strange World\\" is a calm, superbly atmospheric power ballad which finds Paul Di'anno showing off his impressive singing voice over twinkling guitar noise and gently tapping drums. And finally, the album wraps up with two of the fastest and catchiest tunes: \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" and \\"Iron Maiden.\\"<br /><br />Almost no other band has ever come close to duplicating the originality, excitement, energy, timless songwriting, power, infectious hooks, gorgeous melody, virtuosic musicianship, and all-around greatness heard on this album. Thus, \\"Iron Maiden\\" is a definite milestone on heavy metal's timeline, and a true five-star album if there ever were one. It is an absolutely essential inclusion for all heavy metal collections (and music collections in general) worldwide -- it's just one of those C.D.'s that you need to own or you will forever be un-metal!instant classic. \\"Strange World\\" is a calm, superbly atmospheric power ballad which finds Paul Di'anno showing off his impressive singing voice over twinkling guitar noise and gently tapping drums.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|Face it. We live in trying times. History is beginning to repeat itself as we steadfastly ignore the growing evil in the Middle East-sorry to be so un-PC, but it's true. Do you realize that Bible prophecy is coming true with the Iran-Russia connection? Before you label me crazy, this comes from world leaders, not just folks branded by the secular horde as \\"end-days fanatics\\". My point, thank God for Neal. He is here, I feel, for a reason... I hope and pray that Jesus' return is not imminent so that more of us have time to receive him... This is Neal's message. Since Testimony... If indeed we are living in the (now unfortunately cliche end-times), it is nice to have such a talented and wise performer who may, through the power of his music and faith, bring more folks into the fold. Just in case... Thanks for another great one Neal!

B000MG1YC0|2.0|Check out the My Minds Eye video on YouTube... I was hoping it wasn't a representative of the album, but alas, it is. <br /> <br />Compared to older stuff (At Sixes and Sevens - 5 stars) I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1 only because the instrumental parts are still well written (fret not for it is still far above and beyond Lacuna Coil), but whatsherface's pop vocals make it pretty much unlistenable for any older Morten Veland fans. His vocals only make an appearance on 3 tracks, and even then very briefly. <br /> <br />Let's hope that some day they'll re-release this album with vocal tracks completely rearranged and rerecorded.
1582701709|3.0|I admit I got caught up in the pop culture because of the reviews and Oprah's panel discussion.  The concepts have been around forever and if you listen to interviews and read the book, for me the lightbulb flashed on a few points that are important, one is about forgiveness and the other is we all have a story and we should not treat ourselves as a victim, rather the victor. The book is another spin on you are what you think or The Power of Positive thinking !! My sincere hope is that the book does cause people to rethink their lives. The book is a success because people are hungry and searching for answers. In that respect, I hope lives are transformed into goodness. We sure need it.  Life is common sense and simply the choices we make. I will keep the book and share what I got out of it which is hope. This book added to my library would be categorized under Pop Culture. I am glad I read it.  Rather than spend $ 20.00, I would recommend either borrowing it from a friend like I did the CD or check it out of the library or wait until you can get it in Bargain bin or garage sales. There are more important books to read. IE: The bible, let's get back to basics with the ten commandments.  Recommended reading, try the book of Ecclesiastes. I promise, it can be life changing.  <br />
1400079179|4.0|did jesus have a wife? did they have a kid(s)? what does this do to christian belief? it turns it on its head! dan brown is not only an author of page turning thrillers. in dvc he opens a pandora's box of alternative interpretrations of christian, and therefore western, history.<br /><br />as a student of the magdalene theories,i read lots of related material such as holy blood, holy grail, woman with the alabaster jar, etc, etc, but my favorite exploration is the novel The Passion of Mary Magdalen. the Passion never takes itself too seriously, doesn't make claims to historical accuracy. It does one thing, and one thing well...its puts the lost women of the Gospels back into the story. After (or before) you read the DVC, you must read Elizabeth Cunningham's The Passion of Mary Magdalen<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976684306 The Passion of Mary Magdalen: A Novel (Cunningham, Elizabeth, Maeve Chronicles)]]
B000GPIPVU|4.0|Reportedly written during a relationship crisis, the second album from Ray LaMontagne delivers on all the promises of \\"[[ASIN:B0002S947K Trouble]]\\" and opens the singer up emotionally.<br /><br />\\"Well I've been to hell so many times, I must admit you kind of bore me...\\" he laments in the stunning \\"Empty.\\" Emoting in his husky and soulful voice, LaMontagne once again invokes Van Morrison and, to a certain extent, the blue eyed soul of Michael McDonald's early solo albums. There is also the quiet folk that flows through this album's most haunting moments, like \\"Be Here Now,\\" the title track and \\"Barfly.\\" Fans of The Band will probably find themselves in bliss with both the subtle instrumental work and LaMontagne's evocative singing and writing. \\"Three More Days\\" could have easily come from the pen of Robbie Roberston, it really is that good.<br /><br />If you haven't heard either of Ray LaMontagne's CD's yet, indulge yourself. He's learned that excess is a beast trimmed off, and the result is that his albums lack fat or frivolousness. The strings (especially on the terrific \\"Can I Stay\\") and horn arrangements augment the songs with just the right amount of accent, without overkill. One of the best of 2006, for the same reasons \\"Trouble\\" was stuck in my heavy rotation for 2005.

0743454537|4.0|I picked this to read in one of my classes this year and found it incredibly easy to get through. The story was good and I found myself looking foward to reading it. It places you in a situation with no easy answer. Everyone with a brother or sister will tell you that they always thought that so and so was the favoured child. Picoult explores what happens when parents have to act on using one child to save the life of their other.  <br /> <br />As I mentioned, the book was great until the end. I found it as a horrible cop out that came off like it was written in a late night crunch to meet a deadline.

B000002KJM|1.0|I am a recording engineer and sound mixer.  I grew up in Texas, listening to and watching ZZ Top.  The first two ZZ Top albums were released on vinyl records.  Tres Hombres was the first to be released on Compact Disc.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When Firefly first premiered on FOX, like most Science Fiction fans, I was sitting on the couch and waited, watched, and was disappointed. I had no idea who these characters are, nothing was done to explain the world they lived in, and why they are together, why they speak the way they do, nothing. It was interesting, but it did not captivate me at all. I was going to watch a few more episodes, but just never did. When the show was taken off the air, I was not surprised - however, now? I'm shocked and appalled that it was taken off the air! <br /> <br />Fast forward to September of 2005. My life is different; I own a comic book shop (New Moon Comics, LLC in Wayne, NJ), and I'm in Baltimore attending the Retailer Summit hosted by our distributor Diamond Comics Distributor. We get an invitation to see \\"SERENITY\\" a few weeks before it opens nationally. <br /> <br />I spoke to fellow retailers that tell me how great FIREFLY was, and I voice my original opinion that the first episode `lost me' and I just never went back to the show afterwards. They informed me that FOX aired the episodes in the wrong order, and like \\"BABYLON 5\\", \\"24\\" and new shows like \\"HEROES\\" - the order in which the show is seen is paramount! <br /> <br />Christmas, 2006 I receive \\"FIREFLY - THE COMPLETE SERIES\\" and \\"SERENITY\\" on DVD. And this past week, I was able to watch every episode (as stated, I own a retail store, so most of my time is spent with and in that store) from start to end, and capped it off with \\"SERENITY\\" the movie. <br /> <br />This show is hands-down a masterpiece! The acting, characters, humor, the whole universe created by Joss Whedon... My wife and I, for the past week have been discussing these fictional characters as if they were real. Talking about wanting more, and feeling sad that, at present, there will be none. <br /> <br />To those, like me, that did not like the show when it first aired, GET IT! If you're a science fiction fan that loves story, and character driven work, this is YOUR series too! Watch it in the order it was to air, and see for yourself why this show has the following it does. <br /> <br />First rate across the board... And a pleasure, hands down! Dong ma?
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have loved Stevie's music since the late 70's when she was with Fleetwood Mac and then her solo stuff in the early 80's. As other reviewers have stated most of her true fans will already have the songs that appear on the CD either from Timespace or Belladonna, etc. The real gem is indeed the DVD which brings back so many great memories of watching these vids at Happy Hour or in a dance club in DC back in my wild days. I did not know that there was a Scarlett version of Stand Back which was hilariously campy. The commentary is fun to listen to and her humor shines through. Another surprise was hearing Dreams to a club beat which is quite nice. So I would higly recommend this CD/DVD to her diehard fans and for new fans it is a total immersion into the rockin world of Stevie Nicks for which no one else compares.

B000LC55F2|4.0|It's rare when a movie can redeem itself in its last minutes after what seemed to be two hours of confusion, but the \\"Prestige\\" is an exception.  Close to the end of \\"The Prestige,\\" I asked myself \\"What's going on?\\" But the end had me saying \\"That's a great ending.\\"  A lot of people are comparing \\"The Illusionist\\" to \\"The Prestige,\\" due to the similar themes and time period.  Both movies have great casts, but for my money, I'd say The \\"Prestige\\" is playing for higher stakes.   \\"The Illusionist\\" is a wonderful movie, but it does tie everything into a nice neat and sentimental bow at the end.  \\"The Prestige\\" also has a tight ending, but when things come clear, it signals all kinds of dark undercurrents that had previously left the viewer mystified. Love, sacrifice, ambition, revenge, (real?) magic, illusion, the modern age, it's all there for you to ponder.  Oh, I was still left with plenty of muddy moments that would probably have me going back to rewatch the movie to seek further clarification, but the overall story is fairly clear.  One more comment, Christian Bale gives yet another great performance.  He has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business today. <br />

B000MQC9H4|4.0|Most of the negative reviews on this movie are probably written by men.  Since everyone has an opinion and different perspective, however, I have to say I LOVED this film.  I had just gone through a nasty split with a boyfriend of six years and went to see this film hoping to be cheered up.  Not only did it cheer me up, I saw elements in this film that were beyond comedy, beyond simple romance.  I saw an old man who finally was honored for his greatness, two women who deserved better than they were getting and got it and two men who knew how to treat women.  It was beautiful, emotional, soul touching and of course, funny. <br />The guys who see this could learn something.  But most of them probably won't.  Yes, it was lengthy, but worth every minute of it.  There was no blood and guts, no killing and no illegal ploys at work.  It was simply life as it can be when the right people find each other.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is Neil Young at his BEST. Back in 1971 after the release of &#34;After the Goldrush&#34; and before &#34;Harvest&#34;, another popular but unauthorized album was released titled &#34;Young Man's Fancy&#34;, a.k.a. &#34;Live at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion&#34; or &#34;Live in L.A.&#34; which was a very similar show in Los Angeles in February 1971, which I and many of my friends bought copies of and played to death. The &#34;Young Man's Fancy&#34; bootleg has to be the greatest Neil Young bootleg ever issued, but it was an audience recording. Massey Hall is much better fidelity, but I miss having the full, solo guitar & harmonica versions of &#34;Heart of Gold&#34; and &#34;Sugar Mountain&#34;, which were on &#34;Young Man's Fancy&#34;.<br /><br />The DVD serves up the entire Massey Hall audio performance with video footage for almost all the songs, but there are some problems. First, the audio often isn't precisely synced and is just a split-second off from matching the video image; watch Neil's lips or guitarwork, and it is just-not-quite-on-the-spot with the audio.<br /><br />Second, the negative image is backwards on one segment as Neil plays piano. Anyone who plays piano knows that the bass notes are played with the left hand and the treble notes with the right hand. At the end of the piano spot, he also goes to pick up and play his guitar with the neck and frets of the guitar in his right hand. I'm glad to have what we do with this performance footage, but this was an unfortunate mistake, and hopefully will be corrected if this DVD is reissued. Surprised this slipped by the production company, unless Neil intentionally put this in to see if fans caught it.  I doubt it, as he's a perfectionist.<br /><br />Very happy to have this excellent peformance in top-quality sound on CD!  All fans of &#34;After the Gold Rush'' and &#34;Harvest&#34; need to buy this.<br /><br />UPDATE November 2015: Even though this CD is great sound quality, I now realize I haven't listened to it, at all, since the year it was issued. Instead, I went back to hear &#34;Young Man's Fancy&#34; periodically. I guess when something is so firmly imprinted in musical memory, it's a difficult habit to break.it was issued.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|I purchased this as a record album the day it was released. The stuff I had on my turntable at this time was, Sgt. Peppers, In Search Of The Lost Chord, Disraeli Gears, Are You Experienced, Procol Harum, Etc. The debut album from the Doors was and is a perfect magic mirror back to that time. The \\"Doors\\" is recognized by the masses and critics alike as a masterpiece. So is this new release of a masterpiece that's been around for 40 years worth the bother? OH YES! The sound is so good these songs all sound like they were recorded at the same time in space but with the ultimate best fantastic recording equipment of all time! Picture yourself at the \\"Whiskey\\" front row hearing \\"Light My Fire\\" live. That's right - front row, very nice! If you're a Doors fan this is a MUST HAVE. If You love music this is a MUST HAVE!
B00004T9VY|5.0|I just saw HAROLD AND MAUDE again this week (ie: the movie) and remembered how much I had loved TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN.<br /><br />I had owned this as a vinyl album many yrs ago, and had played it all the time.So of course after seeing the movie,  I just had to re-order this album in CD format.<br /><br />No disappointments here. It's as good as ever.<br /><br />I ordered this album as a Re-mastered CD version and it sounded GREAT! Worth the extra few dollars!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I bought nthis DVD because I usually Like Ed Norton's work. Paul Giamatti thrown in was a bonus forged in heaven. I got much more than I paid for. This is an old-fashioned film, photographed lovingly, and in no hurry to tell its story. This little masterpiece is suitable for a man or a woman in its subject matter, of which the less said the better.<br /><br />This movie did not do well in theatrical release, but flies off the store shelves now.
B00005JPCF|1.0|This movie had me wondering what was wrong with me--I had absolutely no feelings about it whatsoever... aside from looking at the time display on the DVD player and wondering when it would end. I don't like it, I don't hate it, it's just a big nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch. I wouldn't have cared if someone turned it off at any time. There was nothing that involved any of my emotions at all. But then I asked the three other people who watched it with me, and they felt pretty much the same, so I think it's the movie, not me. <br /> <br />The best analysis I can come up with is that it's too calculated. Over-calculated, in fact--it seems like a committee-driven mix of Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2 (a hypothetical cheapquel with the usual superficial writing). If they had picked *one* story and stuck to it, maybe they could have developed it into something. <br /> <br />Yeah, sure the computer-generated animation was great, but they even cheapened that by mixing in live action footage, like they had no faith in anything they were doing. I've never seen so much nothing on film before.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|This will be a movie that will either be disliked by James Bond fans or enjoyed by them. I enjoyed the movie, a different take on how Bond will be protrayed will always be welcome compared to the old formula that do get bit old. Daniel Craig proves to be a strange actor to played James Bond but if you are going to reboot the entire series, you might as well take a totally different formula, you might as well start with a totally different Bond. Blond, stocky and rugged looking, Daniel Craig will never passed for Connery, Moore or Bronson. He won't have the toys they had and he won't have the villians as well. Maybe Bond needed to be brought back to earth as Casino Royale have done. Maybe Bond needs to go after common bad guys like terrorists, mass murderers and others instead of folks seeking world control.<br /><br />I thought  Casino Royale was well made Bond film that cut down the high tech toys and worked on the story that appears to fit more closely to what Bond should be doing. While he may not be savig the world one more time, he does what secret service agents should be doing, going after bad guys that threatened safety and security of his nation.<br /><br />The DVD of Casino Royale turned out to be quite a treat. I am writing the review for the two disc special. I can say that the image from the DVD proves to be totally pristine and colors were vivid and clear. The sound proves to be aggressive, clear and well spread. There are a lot of extras attached to this set, most of it lies in the second disc and there are enough to entertained, educated and pondered for most folks who buy this DVD set.<br /><br />The movie will divide the Bond fans but in the end, it all matter of subjective taste. If you cannot adjust and adapt from the old Bond, this movie will not be for you. However, if you enjoyed the old but welcome the new, you will enjoy this movie.

Consider what are your favorite scenes in Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake.  Ponder the best chapters and narrators in Max Brooks' World War Z.  The Walking Dead has all of that, put together, plus a whole lot more.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|I highly recommend Crystal Visions to anyone who enjoys the music of Stevie Nicks. The big selling point on the cd, besides a collection of all of her big solo hits, are the 4 LIVE tracks, which demonstrate Stevie's ability to capture your soul with that amazing, one of a kind voice. One of the best versions of \\"Rhiannon\\" I've ever heard, and she really does justice to \\"Rock & Roll\\", the Zep classic. If you like \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Edge of Seventeen\\", you'll love the two versions of these  songs with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Stevie's vocals are strong, the arrangements of the songs are stellar, and the music is just beautiful. The price of the cd is worth it just for these four songs alone. <br /> <br />And if that's not enough, there's the dvd. All of Stevie's solo videos are included here. You can watch them with or without the commentary. You get to hear the funny side of Stevie as she narrates through the videos, just like she is watching them along with you. It's totally cool. Then there's the big bonus of a home movie from the making of Bella Donna. The first solo effort by Stevie after she gained so much fame with Fleetwood Mac. Once again she displays her sense of humor, her flair for fashion, and a demonstration of just how powerful that voice of hers is, throughout the video.  <br /> <br />I think Crystal Visions is one of the best things she's ever released. GET THIS!
B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen traced the week immediately after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The movie traced the motivations and actions of Queen Elizabeth as she totally misread the mood of her country regarding Diana's death and her gradual horror at her mistakes. She is aided by her Prime Minister Tony Blair who almost against himself, aided, advised and nurtured Queen Elizabeth back to reality. It pretty clear by this movie that without Blair, Elizabeth would have suffered major damages to her reputation and name. She owed him a great deal for his services toward her. (Maybe a future knighthood or peerage might even the honor.)<br /><br />Helen Mirren proves to be totally superb in her role. Was there any doubt of her Oscar? She was probably the only sure bet to win. Her performance nailed Elizabeth II right on the money and managed to conveyed the queen's actions and moods following Diana's death. In some way, the real queen owed her a great debt for portarying such a sensitive role. Mirren was well supported by her supporting cast, great script and sublime directing. Michale Sheen was also great as Tony Blair and James Cromwell probably captured Prince Philip's caddish and tunnel vision behavioral pattern down pretty good.<br /><br />Overall, one of the better movies to come out in 2006, Helen Mirren's performance would be hard to beat in any year.
B00005JKJA|2.0|It starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end.  And about 2/3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I must admit, the only other CD I have of Incubus is Morning View.  But, I was a little desperate for hearing some new rock that wasn't mediocre, and I figured since Morning View was a quality CD, Light Grenades was worth giving a shot.    The album kicks off with \\"Quicksand,\\" which on its own isn't much, but it's a good lead-in to the rest of the album.  I wouldn't listen to it individually, but when used as a starter to hearing the complete CD, it works really well.  7/10    Next is the rocker \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off,\\" which is a little off-putting at first, since the guitar is a little unusual.  But I started to feel it the second and third times I've listened to it.  It's a great track for getting the ol' feet wet for the next three tracks and also works as a stand-alone rocker.  8/10    The track \\"Dig\\" I've heard many Incubus fans say is the only decent track on the CD.  Well, it's a little poppy for my tastes, but there's no denying the song is gorgeous.  There's a really powerful line in here, \\"We'll always have each other/When everything else is gone.\\"  This is the kind of love song that would work to cheer up your lover, your mom, your sibling, whoever, because it could apply to any of them in different ways. 9/10    \\"Anna Molly\\" was apparently the lead single, but I don't listen to the radio, so this is the first I've heard of it.  Incubus seems to have a knack for knowing which song on the CD is going to really click with the masses.  They did it with \\"Wish you Were Here\\" and now have done it with \\"Anna Molly.\\"  Not quite as poppy as \\"Dig,\\" this song still speaks volumes. 10/10    \\"Love Hurts\\" is actually my favorite track off the CD, although at this point there's too much sadness in the tones of these tracks.  Still, this song's a lot more creative and original than I thought it would be, and it blew me away.  If this was the only good song on Light Grenades, it would have been worth the $10 for me. 10/10    But \\"Light Grenades\\" is the turning point forthe worse on this album.  It's not that it's a bad song, but it's a little too much like the bands that I'm not a big fan of in modern rock, like The Vines and Jet.  Still, it's good light fun and it's over quickly, so it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Plus, I think it's good Incubus tries different styles of rock.  7/10    And, oh man, \\"Earth to Bella\\"...what happened?  This is a real mess of a song, and it's really lame.  It starts off as an acoustic ballad with cheesy lyrics, then all of a sudden really bad guitar riffs come out of nowhere and the song's done.  Even worse, a part II comes up as the last track later.  4/10    \\"Oil and Water\\" doesn't get much better, at least on this listen.  It may grow on me, but it's a really boring track after the two minute mark.  There's a bad solo here as well.  And at this point the lyrics really are unimpressive.  5 (or 6)/10    \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" improves on \\"Oil and Water,\\" but it could have been better.  I mean, this song had some real potential to be great, but a few things are askew.  It too, gets repetitive and boring, but this time at around the 3:00 mark and it has more potential to grow on me than \\"Oil and Water,\\" but in the end, it's still not among the better tracks on the album.  6/10    Things finally begin to pick up again with \\"Rogues,\\" which is just an awesome track.  It's really creative and cool, something I haven't heard from modern rock in a little while.  I really cannot think of anything bad about this song, just sit back and jam with it.  10/10    \\"Paper Shoes\\" features the best drumming on the album; gotta commend Jose for the job he does here.  Other than that, nothing too special, but it's more than worth a listen.  8/10    \\"Pendulous Threads\\" is really interesting.  I don't really like the way it starts, but it gets better as time goes on.  Of all the songs here, this is the song that's likely to grow on me the most.  The lyrics really pick up again here and it's easy to feel this song after the2:00 mark.  Nice guitar work, too.  9/10    And finally, \\"Earth to Bella (part II)\\" actually starts off better than part I (not that that's saying much), but then...what happened at the end?  Brendan just sings, \\"Oooohh\\" amidst some really lame guitar work.  Just because something is experimental doesn't mean it's creative (or good, for that matter).  If the two excluded Japanese B-sides replaced the two \\"Earth to Bella\\" tracks, Light Grenades would have been a much better CD.  3/10     Nevertheless, Light Grenades was really refreshing for me to hear.  I'm going to give A Crow Left of the Murder and Make Yourself a listen soon, and maybe S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Fungus Amongus too later on.  Thanks for the music, Incubus, and keep it up!    Also, if you are a fan that just wants to download the good tracks, I'd recommend A Kiss to Send Us Off, Dig, Anna Molly, Love Hurts, Light Grenades, Rogues, Paper Shoes and Pendulous Threads
1594481717|4.0|The author was a presenter at an advertising agency owners' conference that I attended in Montreal last fall.  He is an effective speaker who has earned the right to present his material through hard work, tireless research and an infectious belief in his thesis.  Having met him in person and after devouring his book, I thoroughly recommend it to school and career counselors as well as anyone who needs to figure out what's going on in our skill-based economy.
0374105235|5.0|This gripping story of a boy torn away from his childhood to face the harsh realities of war is not only a page turner, it also shows how lucky most of us not to live such a tormented life.  After reading this book, I cannot imagine anyone being able to cope or survive after living his ordeal.  Ishmael Beah is truly a symbol of hope for everyone.  I recommend this book to anyone who would like a first hand account of what it's like living in war torn nations.

0062502182|5.0|One of the best books that I've ever read in my life.  The book has its own spiritual-type of journey that most of us at some point in our lives will take.  Paul Coelho writes a fictional character that anyone can relate to.  Coehlo's metaphor of the desert as an in-between place (purgatory) for the character is brilliant.
0553565915|4.0|I read this book at a time when I was grieving for a dear friend who died recently.  My friend had died a painful death from pancreatic cancer in the spate of 2mos.  My husband recommended I read this book to lift my spirits.  Did it ever!!!  I found the book to be very uplifting, encouraging, and comforting.  Yes, I admit, at times I felt that what she wrote was a bit \\"fantastic\\"- but you know what?  Who am I to judge whether it happened or not.  In her mind, at least, it did.<br /><br />My takeaway from the book is that there is a better life after mortal life - ont that awaits all of us when it is our time.  I also believe that, yes, each person was put here on earth for a purpose.  Part of life is determining that purpose and doing with it what you can.
B00005JPCF|3.0|Cute penguins...dancing penguins to add to that, what more could I have asked for? Well there were a lot of things I could have asked for. When I first went to the theatre, I was expecting a feel good movie and for the most part I got just that.<br /><br />The first half of the movie, is about Mumble's tragic life as an outcast and his struggles to fit in despite his disability. As the movie  progreses, one sympathizes with his character and roots for him to get the girl.<br /><br />The music choices were by far the best part of the movie as it kept the energy up and helped move along the plot. However once the music stopped and the movie turned towards the path of political activism, that's when things started to go downhill.<br /><br />The movie should have ended with Mumble getting the girl, instead they prolong this animinated feature to include a statement about global warming. Although I agree that global warming is an issue that needs severe attention, it shouldn't have been included in this film. Overall, the first part is great but the second half defeats the point of the movie. If you buy this film I suggest just turning it off after Mumble gets the girl of his dreams.
B00004XMTJ|4.0|A well-done 'staged' production of the musical.  I really like the cast in this version, I've seen Cats live with a different cast and I actually prefer the DVD :) <br /> <br />The sound quality is great, but I don't believe the video is DVD-quality.  It appears to be a transfer from some less-than-DVD-quality source.  There is definitely some graininess, but still it's not BAD looking by any means - just not what you may expect from a DVD.  And it's the highest quality version available so what can you do?  It would be cool to see a higher-def version though. <br />
B000JLQSWE|5.0|The sonics on this remastered disc are a little better than the newly remastered \\"Eye in the Sky\\". Probably because this LP came out a few years later, and I believe this is an import from Germany. Hawkeye is the cherry of the set.  Clean, crisp, full sounding. I only wish this would come out in hi-rez 5.1 multichannel sound. All songs by Alan Parsons should be experienced in surround.

0895260131|5.0|the west must wake up before it is too late and Islamic zealots conquer the world. The books uncovers many truths. I however am not too happy with the crusades part of the book. Christianity is the most peaceful religion. But the crusaders were not nice people. Some Christians can be bad , but one cannot blame christianity for it. Christinaity's core is peace and the crusaders were anything but that. Similar many Muslims have been great . As Ayaan Hirsi Ali pointsout, we must distinguish between Islam and Muslims. Islam is seentially evil. I thought I'd give this book only 3 stars due to its bad treatment of crusades, but I think I will give it 5 stars becasue the truth about Islam is brought forth very accurately and the author deserves my heartist congratulations for not falling prey to liberal CAIR nonsense about Islam being peaceful
B000M5AJQS|5.0|After searching for this same 2-disc DVD set everywhere, this was the cheapest I found by comparison, even including shipping.  I loved the movie, so the 2nd disc with all the featurettes was a must for me.  Arrived much sooner than I was expecting, too.  Good buy.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|To the other reviewer, you are a fool to give these CDs anything less than 5 stars, and you should be banished to hearing Fur Elise permanently until you repent of your ways.  As a classical piano composer and teacher, I am definetely spoiled with piano music, it's true.  But this is a real gem, TRUE ART, where even a metronome is rendered petty and useless to this, thank you very, very, much.  Saint-Saen's 5 Piano Concertos, and David Helfgott's performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto IS as good as it gets.  This is art with a soul, their is no hidden agenda, no undercurrent to this music.  This recording is fine, don't listen to the other reviewer.  I would give it 10 stars if I had the option.  Much of these 2 CDs is compltely unique in the realm of piano music.  The 2nd Mov. of the 5th Concerto is unforgettable, just to name one.  Go ahead and get this one, if you don't, you are sinning, right now.
6305897786|4.0|The reviews are about as interesting as the movie. Most people can find faults with the movie, yet most are intrigued by it at the same time.  Some are offended due to religious sensibilities, others are offended because they read the book. <br /> <br />I just find the movie interesting. I find Corso likeable. I like most of Depp's acting, he's usually understated and underrated. His deliveries are always more on the subtle side, a method I highly prefer.  And the movie is subtle and low keyed as well. And what a lovely devil. Seems that the devil is not what it's cracked up to be.  Of course, in reality, neither is the real devil--namely, there is no devil. This truth, if it were really believed, would come as a complete shock to the majority.  How much they would miss him, as he's a part of all of us, just as is the god.

All of the characters in this movie will literally tug at your heart strings. Happy Feet is destined to be the Best Movie of the Year
B0006B2A42|3.0|Partial spoiler below, but of the original novel, not the movie. ******** I will be the first to admit that the first half of \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is a damn near perfect film adaptation of the first third of one of the greatest suspense and adventures novels ever written. The casting is perfect, the performances are dead on, and the screen play includes the major plot points and the important sequences from the \\"Dolphin's\\" trip from its base in Scotland to the Arctic Ice Pack. The torpedo tube sabotage that nearly sinks the \\"Dolphin\\" in particular, has got to be one of the most gripping and intense \\"submarine crisis\\" sequences EVER filmed.<br /><br />However, for the 2/3rds of the film (after the \\"Dolphin\\" has arrived at the Ice Station) the film-makers decided that they couldn't trust the source material and veered away from much of what made the novel so great. Don't get me wrong, the story they chose to film is still a pretty good adventure and suspense tale, it just wasn't \\"Ice Station Zebra\\". What made the novel so great was the powerful depiction of the cross country trek Carpenter and two of the crew are forced to make to reach the survivors while the \\"Dolphin\\" searches for thinner ice to break through closer to the wrecked station. And following this epic struggle, as the sub journeyed back under the ice pack with the survivors of the disaster the novel becomes a \\"whodunit\\". Carpenter queries the survivors in attempt to find the spy (or traitor) in their ranks who started the fire and killed several members of the station crew even before he set the fire. And people start getting their skulls cracked open as the spy lurks about the ship as Carpenter plays cat-and-mouse with him. And then there is an amazing plot turn as the spy sabotages the nuclear reactor with a fire UNDER THE ICE and the crew must race to defeat a monstrous blaze before they asphyxiate. And the final plot twist and the abrupt reversal of fortune at the end, is one of the most clever and satisfying I have ever read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what we got instead in the movie was a bunch of people pointing assault rifles at each other in a fairly straightforward game of \\"Brinksmanship\\". Again, this was well done, but not NEARLY as intelligent and involving as the novel.<br /><br />So, docked several points for not trusting the source material and going for the \\"loud and obvious\\" ending. But it is still a GREAT thriller.satisfying I have ever read.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, what we got instead in the movie was a bunch of people pointing assault rifles at each other in a fairly straightforward game of \\"Brinksmanship\\".

B000MGUZM0|4.0|To get the bad out of the way, I'll admit that Win's vocals can get a little annoying and bloated in this album. That and Black Wave really isn't a good song at all. <br /> <br />Otherwise, the whole album flows almost flawlessly, the diversity and richness in sound is wonderful and dynamic, the artwork is beautiful, and there are a number of fantastic songs that rival those found on Funeral. <br /> <br />Favorite songs so far: <br />Black Mirror <br />Ocean of Noise <br />The Well and the Lighthouse <br />No Cars Go <br />My Body is a Cage
B000LC55F2|5.0|Wow, what a breath of fresh air this film is. One of the most intelligent and twisting scripts in years filled with fantastic performances, particularly from Christian Bale.  Disgraceful that this was totally overlooked at this years oscars. Just like magic itself, this film captivates our imagination and love of the extraordinary and leaves us with an impression that we have just seen something wonderful and whether or not the reality we are presented with is indeed true. Far superior to the Illusionist on every level.

0783231202|5.0|Amistad is a true story about an 1839 mutiny aboard a slave ship that is traveling towards North America. It is a story in the period when new slaves were illegal, but trading in slaves that were already slaves, was allowed. With a powerful all-star cast including Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins and Matthew McConaughey, it is a story that will grip your heart and move your spirit. Much of the story takes place in a courtroom drama about the free-man who led the revolt, and deals with questions of freedom, humanity and dignity.<br /><br />The movie, though slow moving, is intense, and the drama builds as many groups claim the slaves as their property. This story is truly gripping and a story of extreme importance in understanding our own history. This lesser-known Spielberg film is truly a must see.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I purchased this more for the younger crowd around my house but as I looked in and watched I found myself enjoying this yarn as well. Enjoyable to say the least. Entertaining to say the least...
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a true story and it is a very sad one in the history of the west and of the church.<br /><br />Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson and many more take us through the history of slavers in South America. Irons, who plays a Spanish Jesuit Priest, goes into the wilderness to build a mission, to convert the Indians. DeNiro plays a slaver who eventually joins Irons' mission and serves the native peoples.<br /><br />The main question in this film is that of ownership, and the right to make slaves. The mission begins in Spanish territory that is sold to the Portuguese. The Portuguese do not want to accept that the natives are humans - but at best trained monkeys - and that their Christianity does not protect them from becoming slaves. The Cardinal who came to oversee the decision came with a decision already made, and his inner turmoil, as the narrator, draws the viewer into the political side of the decision and the political side of the church's role in the decision, at that time, in a way that few other films ever have.<br /><br />The film is a cinematographic masterpiece. While watching the movie, pay close attention to light and darkness, the music, and the angles used in filming. This movie is great and a must see because of the story it tells and the way it tells it. It is truly a film and not just a movie.
1582701709|5.0|In a word...inspirational!  This book, if its practices are followed, will provide the reader with a wealth of power at his fingertips.  When I read about miracles, I am a skeptic until I have my own experiences.  I can tell you by practicing and truly practicing these philosophies, I have experienced the power I have always possessed.  Buy it!
B00000K0DQ|5.0|This is both a book and a movie that you need to interact with. Particularly in a day and age when there is a movement here in Canada to try to bring the death penalty back. The book is much more in depth than the movie. The book profiles the first three men that Sr. Prejean goes to the death chamber with as Spiritual Director. It profiles her mistakes as she journeys down this path for the first few times. She witnessed her first execution on April 5th, 1984 and she has been advocating against the death penalty since then.<br /><br />The book does a great job of showing the disparity in how the death penalty is applied. It goes through the studies on its lack of effectiveness, and how for the most part, it is the poor and the African-American who are on death row. Even if you only read the appendices, the book will challenge you to view the death penalty in a different way.<br /><br />The movie was the inspiration and starred Susan Sarandon. Sarandon was given the book while on a personal retreat at a monastery; she came home and gave the book to her partner, Tim Robbins, who directed the film. Together they approached Sr. Prejean, who went out and rented Bull Durham. She was a little leery of having them do the film, but after meeting with them went ahead with the project.<br /><br />The film co-stars Sean Penn as Matthew Poncelet, a compilation of the 3 men in the book. The movie, while slow moving, is incredibly intense and draws you into the drama of waiting for a death when you know the date and time of that approaching death.<br /><br />As an interesting aside, another good book is Forgiving the Dead Man Walking by Debbie Morris, who was one of the victims of Robert Lee Willie from the book. Debbie always said if they ever made a movie, Penn would have to play Willie because they looked so much alike.<br /><br />So read the book and watch the movie, and if you want yet another challenging book, give Forgiving the Dead Man Walking a read also.
0743496728|4.0|Bought this for my wife. She devoured the novel in three days. Apparantly it's up to par with other Picoult novels.
0897500482|2.0|Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee, published after his death, is neither a book in the sense it has a plot, nor a manual to guide learning. It is simply a collection of sayings, statements and raw sketches in search of an author or a great editor.<br /><br />There is very little connectivity between paragraphs that could give the reader a sense of where the author was heading. In essence, his survivors simply published his unedited note book.<br /><br />Some people might gain insight from reading this book; I could not unravel his message.
B000IJ79V6|2.0|I was disappointed when I bought this version, when I recorded the Superman 2 version on ABC way back in the late 80's.  VHS tapes don't last, so I wanted the UNCUT version of Superman 2 on DVD.  I wasted my money.<br /><br />Vital scenes are cut from the DVD:<br /><br />1)  Superman saves the boy at Niagra Falls. He goes back to the hot dog stand and meet up with Lois, changes back to Clark Kent and walks away from the hot dog stand with a proud and humourous smile on his face (knowing that he saved the boy).<br /><br />2)  Flying to Paris.....and it shows him passing the Concorde in the sky.<br /><br />3)  A prison scene with Lex and Otis, about Otis going \\"pssh\\", which Otis mentions he had wished before they left the cell, even though it means something else.  Funny scene.<br /><br />4)  Miss Teschmacher needed to go to the bathroom at the Fortress of Solitude, where she says she thinks she found it.  And Lex says, \\"she found it.\\"<br /><br />5)  And finally, the ending where Superman defeats the 3 supervillains, Lex shows more interest in befriending Superman (which he doesn't), the cops show up at the Fortress to arrest Lex, and Superman destroys the Fortress Of Solitude.<br /><br />There's more from the ABC version, but too difficult to explain.<br /><br />Just to say, the Lester cut wasn't worth the price!  I don't know about the Donner version, but the DVD creators destroyed this movie....and who knew a TV version would be so much better!

B00005JPGO|5.0|One of the best movies of 2006, \\"Blood Diamond\\" combines the action movie with the heart-rending 'issues' movie - films like \\"Hotel Rwanda\\", \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" and \\"Rabbitproof Fence\\", which feature stories of real-life atrocities that have taken place or are still taking place.  The meld is extremely potent - the seriousness of the issues presented is never minimilized or brushed off, but the fact that the movie is a fictionalized account of a real situation provides for the welcome possibility of a somewhat happier ending for the innocents than usually happens in 'true story' movies like this, and the tantalizing lure that the heinous villains may not escape justice as they so often do in real life.  (On the other hand, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is grim enough that neither of those possibilities seems guaranteed, generating tremendous suspense).  On the action movie front, the fact that these bad guys are right out of the papers and evening news makes it impossible not to root against them with a particular vengeance.  The stakes seem much higher than in many action movies and have a profound effect on the heart. <br /> <br />   Taking place in the '90s civil war of Sierra Leone, the \\"Blood Diamond\\" of the title refers to diamonds which, like many other valuable substances, have been mined in Africa by slave labor repeatedly in recent years to pay for war efforts on behalf of both ruthless rebel factions and brutal governments.  The diamond end of this appaling tragedy has to a large degree been cleaned up by the establishment of the Kimberly Process (designed to keep 'blood diamonds' off the open market) but the practice was in full swing at the time the story here takes place.  Djimon Hounsou plays the father of a family in a village where rebels come to abduct the population - to turn the young into brainwashed 'child soldiers' and to press many of the adults into slave labor in the diamond rivers.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a smuggler/mercenary who has dealings withthe rebel group, and who comes to a stage in his life where he has to decide if it's too late to try and turn away from the brutal way he's lived his life.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist in Africa trying to gather evidence to expose the blood diamond trade and its links to rich Western corporations.  Her character, Maddy, has piled up a track record of uncovering similiar abuses all over the world.  In an ordinary movie, any one of these three stars would steal the show, but in \\"Blood Diamond\\" all three lead players deliver astonishing performances.  So, in fact, does the entire supporting cast.  The discovery in the slave rivers of one of the largest diamonds in the world (worth millions) and, moreover, the quest of Hounsou's character Solomon Vandy to escape and rescue his family (including the son that's been taken by the rebels) and the various characters who risk their lives to help him, provide main points for the movie.  <br /> <br />   In terms of production, everything's perfect - the action sequences, the cinematography, the musical score, everything.  The lush natural beauty of Sierra Leone is captured amazingly well, and having such breat-taking natural imagery as the backdrop for such a brutal series of events is poignant, to say the least. <br /> <br />   Excellent in every respect, one of the very best picks from a year that was loaded with great movies.
1572814748|3.0|I ordered these because I like my larger (regular-sized) deck of Universal Tarot *so* much, and wanted something I could carry around.  I got my deck today.  My first thought was, \\"Eh.  They're okay, I guess.\\"  I've now compared them to a pocket-sized original deck, and I guess I like them a little better.  Enough to keep them.  In comparison to the original RWS (Rider-Waite-Smith), the artwork is just more refined, with more detail in the shadows and such.<br /><br />I do not, however, feel as though I got what I was hoping for.  In comparing them with the large Universal Deck, the colors are more vibrant, which I don't like as much, but it's not just that, they are also more grainy.<br /><br />For instance, if I compare the Ace of Swords, on the regular-sized deck, the sky is just a smooth grey.  On the pocket deck, it's not only darker, but it has a noticeable grain to it.  Now, whether this is better or worse may be a matter of personal opinion.  I showed the difference to my husband and he liked the smaller one better.  The one thing he mentioned was that on the pocket deck, you can see the radiance around the hand.  On the large deck, you can barely see it.<br /><br />On the larger deck, it's like there's a diffusion on it.  That's the only way I can describe it. It gives it a softer, more subtle look.  That's really what I was looking for, and what I like so much about the large Universal Deck.  But, like I say, I think I probably like it more now that I've compared it to the original RWS deck, because the artwork does look much more refined and detailed.<br /><br />I have several small decks: the original RWS in both mini and pocket size; Albino; LS Universal; and now this one.  I was tired of the colors of the RWS and the Albino, and I'm not always in the mood to use the LS Universal, so I'll probably find this one useful.  It's just not what I was hoping for.  If you think you're going to get something that looks just like the large Universal Tarot, you won't.  I do have to say, though, the backs on these are *awesome!*  They're a very cool blue design with clouds and a yellow star.<br /><br />A lot of people comment on the box.  It *is* a nice box. I'm not sure how useful it will be carrying around, because it's pretty substantial, so just weight-wise, I'll probably put them in a bag, but it *is* very nice.<br /><br />The one last thing I'll comment on is, I don't think the quality of the cards is quite as nice as the on the large deck.  The large deck seems to have a much smoother finish.  But the card weight seems to be fine.  I think it'll be a useful deck.  Now, I'll be interested if they ever decide to put out a mini or pocket-sized Radiant deck.<br /><br />Caat<br /><br />Addendum: July 19, 2007:  I wouldn't change anything I've said about these cards, but I do need to say that the more I use them, the more I like them.<br /><br />Caatthough, the backs on these are *awesome!*  They're a very cool blue design with clouds and a yellow star.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|I've been an A7X for about 5 years now and I own all their cds. I fell in love with the sound on \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet,\\" but after listening to the whole cd, I found that things seemed a bit repetitive.  <br />Of course in those days, A7X was mostly a punk band, and their 3 minute songs seem to reflect that. <br />To me, it was hardcore punk. Noting to \\"metal\\" about it. <br />The second cd, \\"Waking the Fallen\\" provided what I thought \\"Sounding . . .\\" was missing: a more refined, tighter sound. It just sounded like the band finally came together.  <br />Now, A7X moves a different direction with \\"City of Evil.\\" This seems to be  largely an exploratory album for the band, as they experiment with Latin music and symphonic breaks.  <br />However, when I listen to this cd, I can't help but feel I've heard everything before . . . on a Dream Theater/Liquid Tension Album. <br />Don't get me wrong, I love A7X and their music, but the music on \\"City of Evil\\" sounds like it was stolen off Dream Theater's \\"Scenes from a Memory,\\" (to a lesser extent) \\"Train of Thought,\\" or Liquid Tension Experiment's \\"Liquid Tension Experiment 2.\\"  <br />It's still a great album, and I love watching the band mature the way they have. They're a solid band that can outperform most groups I have seen.  <br />I like the album, and I like the direction in which the band is headed. Keep up the good work.
B00000F169|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was in college 30 years ago and loved it.  It was made on a shoe-string budget and was John Carpenter's first full length movie release.  It is a sci-fi comedy and parody.  The special effects are obviously not up to today's standards, but they were pretty good for the time it was made.  I think this movie actually presents space travel in a more realistic light than most other sci-fi shows I have seen.  In this movie, systems on the ship are breaking down forcing the crew to come-up with work arounds, and the crew is going stir-crazy from spending years out in deep space.  The government says they appreciate the important work the crew is doing, but doesn't want to send out a repair ship to help them because it is too expensive.  While this probably done for comic effect, if we ever do develop long range space travel, you know this is how things will probably be.<br /><br />All-in-all, while it is not as action packed as most of today's sci-fi movies, this is a funny movie with a different take on deep space travel.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Incredible! So glad I bought it. As I remember them. Sound and accoustics are incredible on digital suround.
B0009EP070|5.0|While the price of this import is too high and this release has been superceded by a new one with bonus material, that is no reason to give this CD one star.  The music on this CD is great and was revolutionary when it was released in 1969.  This album was one of the most important of the era and is a must!<br /><br />Having said that, I would recommend that you pass on this release and buy the newer US release.  It is cheaper and has previously unreleased bonus material.

B000002J0P|5.0|This album is a classic and was revolutionary when it was first released in 1969.  It went to number 6 on the Billboard album chart in the US and produced two hit singles: Marrakesh Express and Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  But every song on the album received at least some airplay on the \\"hip\\" FM stations that played album cuts, and many of them are still staples of classic rock stations to day.<br /><br />While this was a great release, it has been superceded by a newer edition of the CD with bonus tracks.  I would recommend that you pass on this edition and pick-up the newer edition with the bonus material.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I'm a Bond fan from the early days. Of course Connery was the Gold Standard, But Moore and Brosnan and Dalton all were great. The only problem was Connery at the end wanted to play it too tounge in cheek, and others who followed seem to do that also to some extent. The last time Bond really was true to Ian Flemming's vision was probably in \\"From Russia With Love\\". Thank goodness we've come full circle. This was the first Bond novel and Craig is simply perfect. Bond is not a cartoonish aloof super man but a real courageous, human, passionate man again! I had my doubts, but Craig is spot on perfect and the film is really taut, dramatic, suspenseful and way cool! Long live Bond! He's fresh and new again!

Photography is stunning and the research is great. Get this and remember why sometimes TV is worth watching!!

0940985691|5.0|I wish this was the first book I had read  on Astrology. The authors start with a broad overview, touch on the various schools of astrology, and cover the specifics. Highly recommended if you are a beginner, or Just trying to understand Astology for your own personal purouse.You can use this to refer back to again and agin  since it has a lot of factual information. There are many insights not found eslewhere in introductory books. After having dabbled quite a bit in Jyotish, I had never come across the beautiful explanation of the Grahas as the \\"Seizers\\". There are detailed chapters on Panchanga, nakshatras,Yogas.<br /><br />For the Really Really Beginner -- I also suggest  getting a copy of 'Vedic Astrology Simply Put' - By William Levacy (Available on Amazon).<br /><br />I am familiar with Robert Svobodas Aghora Books, so, I am able to understand why his insigts are so profound.
B000LC55F2|4.0|WOW! What a movie! If you like movies that are thoughtful, twisty and keep you thinking after the last credit rolls, then this is the movie for you.  It is a movie that you can't say a lot about for fear of giving away the plot.  <br /> <br />The movie is not a fast paced movie and you can't spend time doing needlepoint or a crossword puzzle while watching it. You need to keep your eyes glued to the screen or else you will miss something. It is a movie you will want to watch more than once so you can find the clues you missed the first time. All of the actors do a bang-up performance in this movie and I highly recommend it!
1932100660|5.0|This is the most valuable, well researched information on nutrition I have ever found.  It is so well written, it is hard to put the book down.  That is not what you would expect for a book on this subject.  Anyone who wants to avoid the common diseases we have been told to expect as we age should read this book.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|First of all, this is simply a great movie. The narrative is brought to life with humor, action, important life lessons, and conservational commentary. The voice actors all give 5-star performances and the animation is incredible. <br /> <br />But, this being the Blu-ray disc, I'm going to focus on the picture and sound. <br /> <br />The animation by itself is simply breath-taking; easily one of, if not the best looking CGI feature to date. But in HD, it's brought to life even further. Every feather on the penguins is apparent, every flake of snow falling through the air and I'd almost go so far as to say every molecule of water! This is the best looking animated feature you can get on Blu-ray now. It's definitely the show-off piece when people ask \\"How much better does HD look?\\". The leopard seal was particularly mind-blowing to me. <br /> <br />Another hook is the sound. While I wouldn't say this is the best sounding movie on Blu-ray, it definitely puts sound to good use and ranks pretty high. All five channels are used when appropriate, but Happy Feet does not utilize them as much as other films. Still, crank up the sound and the action scenes will blow you away. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent movie made even better on Blu-ray. At this time, this is the Blu-ray disc to own for giving people lessons about HD.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|The Doors's last album (at least with Morrison), L.A. Woman, is arguably their best.  Despite the fact that Morrison at least was falling apart at the time, he still manages somehow to make a great album with his bandmates.  The songs are incredibly tight and intricate.  The Doors were almost a blend between the blues, jazz, and prog rock.  The Changeling, The Wasp, the title track, and Riders on the Storm are some of the greatest songs the Doors ever recorded, and some of the greatest songs in rock history.  It seems to me that Jim Morrison must have done all the drugs in The Doors, because the other three played so damn well together, both in the studio and live.  Where a lot of 60's band went into free form jamming like the Grateful Dead (sometimes amazingly successful, other times lame and boring), when the Doors jammed, it was still really tight and never sloppy.  Morrison died shortly after this album, but the remaining three carried on for 2 more albums, both of which got mixed reviews.  On this edition of L.A. Woman, the old Muddy Waters song, You Need Meat (Don't Go No Further), is included as a bonus track.  Before, it was only available on the 2 LP greatest hits collection Weird Scenes inside the Gold Mine.  It's really good, and it's Ray Manzarek singing lead (and singing it quite well).  This is my favorite Doors album.
B00002EPJH|4.0|I've generally avoided Keith Jarrett, having long been turned off and left cold by the grunts and moans that he seems unable to keep in check during otherwise great performances.  To these ears, Jarrett's tendencies were horribly distracting and overwhelming evidence of an off-putting egotism.  However, \\"The Melody and Night, with You\\" is an incredible surprise!  Here, Jarrett effectively tones down his vocal \\"involvement\\" so that you can fully appreciate the genius of his muscianship. This CD has a fantastic selection of classics by the likes of Duke Ellington and George Gerswhin;  Indeed, Jarrett manages to underscore the greatness of these original songwriters by finding something new in his versions of \\"I Got it Bad (and that ain't good),\\" \\"Someone To Watch Over Me,\\" \\"Blame it On My Youth\\" and \\"Shenendoah.\\"  In fact, nearly every piece here is consistently restrained and elegant, yet you feel the full force of Jarrett's considerable improvisational skills. Keith Jarrett won't make you forget the incomparable lyricism of the late great Bill Evans, but \\"The Melody at Night, With You\\" is an undeniably magnificent--and distraction-free--showcase of his specific genius.
B00004VWAF|5.0|I really, really dig this album.  I got into it right away.  I've always loved later Miles, from 1965-1975, starting with Nefertiti and going straight through to Panagea.  This is a sonic assault, in which Miles takes everything that was influencing him at the time, from Sly and the Family Stone to Hendrix, and weaves it into an electric jazz/funk fusion.  Critics, who have always tried to get to Miles (the liner notes of the CD has some great quotes about how Miles feels about critics), went into coniptions over this album.  They were still reeling from Bitches Brew, and Miles threw this in their face.  Brilliant, Miles, brilliant!  This started Miles's final excursion until he retired in 1975.  This period in Miles's creative journey probably could be classified as acid funk/jazz fusion, with worldly elements thrown in for good measure (tabla, tamboura, sitar).  To me, it's just Miles bringin' the brillance.  The tracks are all connected with each other, so they play like a massive funk suite, which is sweet.  Let's call it Miles Davis's 1st funk concerto....
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Keeping in mind that it is a movie and not a word-for-word visual adaption of the book, this film captures the essence of the book - in my opinion.  The growing affection and ultimate love of Jane & Rochester is tenderly and passionately portrayed in this film. Toby Stephens & Ruth Wilson are ideal for their roles and together they have wonderful chemistry. I had to purchase it and make it a part of my collection. Highly recommended!
0375831002|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" by Markus Zusak is one of the bes books I've ever read.  The story follows Liesel, and young girl growing up in Germany during World War II, for several years of her life.  Depsite having many hardships to endure, Liesel finds bits of pleasure in small things, especially books and reading, and she shares this pleasure with others.  Death is the narrator of this book and provides interesting comments and perspectives on what is happening all around him.   <br /> <br />Although this book is categorized as a \\"young adult\\" book, I would recommend it to anyone.  This beautifully written book touched me deeply and will stay with me forever.  It is truly one of the best book I've ever read.
B000E97X66|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have influenced almost every band, musician, songwriter, and poet that followed and many that preceded.  This album successfully captures the energy and creativity of a band of 20 something upstarts entering into their peak.  For those who knew Bruce before the Time and Newsweek covers, this album is for you as it captures many of the highlights of \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\", \\"The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\", and \\"Born To Run\\".  Until now I always thought the best ever live recording was \\"The Allman Brothers, Live at the Fillmore East\\" This album is causing me to rethink that.  A `must have' for all Springsteen fans no matter when they came along!
B0009XFMZ6|5.0|This is by far Rory's greatest recorded statement.  This is a MUST own in the original CD version..........add to the fact that its a very limited edition 'VINYL\\" CD release and Rory fans should be lining up to purchase this automatically without thought.  I'm not going to go into all the details of why you should own this CD (check out the reviews of the regular CD version if you need to know).  Needless to say......Rory Gallagher ROCKS!   If you've read this far the next thing you need to do is click 'BUY' and live happily ever after.    Five x a million (miles way) stars ! ! ! !
B000001F5F|5.0|I'd take it further and have a box set from the first 3 tours, include \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" video UNCUT with U2 Commentary (it's long overdue), US Festival, and the TV appearances from 1978-1983.  <br /> <br />I have noticed U2 starting to go backwards in putting their live shows on DVD. We've got Popmart now, but Zoo TV, the 1988 windup show of the Joshua Tree/Rattle and Hum tour, the Unforgettable Fire live performances (making of is part of \\"Go Home\\") and this one still have yet to be released. It is interesting to see how they've gone through a lot of changes as live performers.  <br /> <br />It might have to be something similar to what Neil Young and KISS are planning, a multidisc retrospective.  <br /> <br />

B00005JJX8|5.0|This film shows Hitchcock in a playful rather than macabre mood and calls to mind the screwball comedies of the 1930's.    Dapper Cary Grant plays John Robie, a reformed cat burgler from the French Riviera, who sets out to catch the current jewel thief who's imitating his own past crimes. Patrician beauty Grace Kelly is an American heiress whose clever mother, apparently the reader of too many Henry James novels, has brought her to Europe for the overt purpose of catching a husband. Kelly sets out, not surprisingly, to catch a thief of her own in the person of the Cary Grant character. Reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn in \\"Bringing Up Baby,\\" underneath a distracted manner, she pursues her prey with single-minded wit and energy, giving the lie to her mother's description of her as a dull, overly refined, probably unmarriageable woman.    The two stars exchange a considerable amount of witty repartee. Kelly, for instance, at her verbal best, rejects Grant's lie that he's a wealthy lumberman from Oregon. He reminds her, she says sunnily in her mock innocent little girl's voice, of English actors in Hollywood films who try and fail to pass themselves off as Americans. Their accent and manner are all wrong. Such a combination of brains and beauty sweep Grant pretty quickly off his feet. A classic ensuing scene of romance, punctuated by exploding fireworks, says it subtly and says it all.    The supporting cast includes many veteran scene stealers. Chief among them is a raucous, refreshingly vulgar, excessively monied Jesse Royce Landis, playing Kelly's mother. In a memorable bit of Hitchcock business, she closes in on a room service breakfast tray, surprisingly and hilariously extinguishing her cigarette, of all places, in the yolk of a sunny side up egg. Presumably, to this clever, wealthy American abroad, the world is her ashtray.    If the movie is judged in the spirit in which it was conceived, as a light entertainment rather than any profound study of human experience, it would be hard not to award it five stars.
B00005JPCF|4.0|I have watch and I have liked this movie.  It is for all the family but with a message for older people and a good lesson of life for everybody. <br />I know some don't like it but I did.  Very good anim movie !
0060245867|5.0|It's all just one short joke, but its amusing.  Give a mouse a cookie, and you'll be stuck in an infinite loop of mouse pampering.  Too bad the last page doesn't have \\"DON'T GIVE COOKIES TO MICE!\\" in real big neon letters.

B000NA2776|5.0|When I first heard Grace Kelley, I thought it was a funny song.  Now I love it and start singing with it every tie it's on the radio.  When I purchased the CD, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I don't purchase many CDs, so for me to buy one means that I really like that song/artist. <br /> <br />I received the CD and was immediately bopping along with it.  I listened to it again immediately after the first go around.  <br /> <br />This CD is fun and lively.  It's funny lyrics are also great.  If you like Grace Kelley, you will probably like the rest of the CD.
0099908506|5.0|As the previous reviewer indicated, this is an excellent novel. Apparently however, Mr. Biswas is not entirely familiar with Hemingway. In 1926 Charles Scribner's Sons of New York published Hemingway's first novel, \\"The Torrents of Spring.\\" Shortly after, in the same year, they also published his second novel \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" The following year (1927) the London firm of Jonathan Cape published this second novel in England under Hemingway's original title, \\"Fiesta.\\" This reprint of that English edition is, in fact, subtitled \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\" No matter what you call it, this is some of Hemingway's finest work. <br />

B000083C49|4.0|Star Trek IV is a classic -- considered by some to be the best of the Trek movies.  The movie as it appears on this DVD looks and sounds just fine on my regular TV with regular stereo sound.  Personally, I can't tell the difference between the DVD quality and VHS quality, though a better home theater system might behave differently. <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, the special features are decent.  Some of the interviews are a little dull.  The section which explains the scientific phenomena present in the movie is also somewhat boring -- even to an engineer like myself.  There are some nice featurettes, though, including interviews conducted with Shatner, Nimoy, and Hicks about 4 or 5 years ago (as of 2007). <br /> <br />Overall, this DVD is worth the money, especially to a Trekkie.  It's still Star Trek IV, even if the special features are a tad disappointing.

0743289692|5.0|I purchased this because I loaned my hard copy to someone and have not received it back.  I wanted to be sure I had a copy to read again when I want to.  It is an excellent page turner book about Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life.  She is an amazing person.  She came from a deeply Muslim background and describes her life in detail so we get an idea of what it was like growing up this way in a male dominated society where women are totally restricted.  She pulled herself out of this to become a parliamentarian in Holland and now lives successfully in the United States.  I pray for her safety as she has to have bodyguards.
0743496728|4.0|I applaud the way that Jodi Picoult can get a reader inside the minds of her charaters. Bullying, as well as cliques among students, is reality. I do however, agree with another reviewer that the romance between Alex and Patrick was not only predictable, but also unnecessary to the story. Another thing that I found a bit disturbing was Josie's miscarrige. Teenage pregnancy is also a reality. But after researching the internet for a litany of ways to self-abort, she woke up one morning in a pool of blood; a magical miscarriage that left me wondering...did she just go the school as usual, without medical attention, and with her seemingly perseptive mother never having a clue ?
0374105235|4.0|I knew about the boys being used as soldiers in Africa,but this was a dose of what it is really like. The truth of the matter is we are all capable of what these young boys end up doing, given the circumstances.  If we are raised with love it is natural to love and if we are raised to hate, it is more natural to hate.  Look at the Muslim extremists.  Their lives focus on hate on a day to day basis.  It becomes very easy to kill and means nothing.  This is how people lose their souls. It is hard enough for people to recover from participating in a just war, but the slaughter these kids are raised with is a nightmare and it is a miracle if any recover emotionally and spiritually.  I was grateful this young man has survived, regained his soul, and lived to tell about it. I pray that this will happen to all the other youngsters.
B00005JPGO|5.0|Though the film is raw and violent, Edward Zwick assures us in the Special Features dialogue that the actual barbarity of the RUF was far beyond anything depicted in the movie. There is a very emotional story between a father and his family and the quest to bring his son home after the boy is kidnapped by the RUF rebels and turned into a killer. This backstory behind the history brings a dose of realism to the characters that we can sink an attachment into. We really care about the story and what happens to the people in it; something that is often missing from many action packed films. Leo DiCaprio does a masterful job with the dialect and acting, along with Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. This is a splendid screenplay that's well balanced, entertaining and at the same time complex in its description of just one of the many long struggles in Africa. Exceptional movie, brilliant acting! If I'd been a judge it would've won several Oscars.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000ICL3KG|5.0|While I don't agree with everything that was mentioned in this movie, I found it to be realistic and informative.  Though extreme, I believe all of us can take a part and do some of the recommended tips mentioned in this movie.  Since I live in a very isolated rural area that gets a lot of snow, owning anything other than a 4x4 is impossible, and they don't address the realities of rural living.  We don't have a bus line here, we can't walk to work or bike living 15 miles from town, nor do we have a recycling program; the nearest drop off is over 90 miles away.  However, we can lessen our electricity use, plant more trees and greenery, hang out the clothes to dry during the warm season, etc..  I have a new respect for Al Gore and wish him success in this project.  He deserves a lot of respect for this documentary.
B000M4RG42|3.0|As a retired Marine who served in combat in Viet Nam and have read about Iwo Jima since the day I joined the Corps, I must say I was disappointed in the movie - especially since the book was so well done.  The combat scenes are quite impressive a' la Saving Private Ryan, but as the story unfolds it is difficult to follow the characters and understand exactly who was where and who did what.  The acting is good but not great.  Not Clint Eastwood's best effort.  If you liked the book you will enjoy the movie, but not as much.
B000FA57NK|4.0|To view and relive this cinematic retelling of the astronauts' odyssey in HD is purely a sight to behold. The space scenes make you feel like you're really out thre with them. A little grainy sometimes in scenes involving the families of the astronauts or other \\"non-space\\" stuff, but you have to remember that this film is actually quite old now, so I believe the transfer is as good as can be expected, with little to gripe about. I would have appreciated a Dolby True HD sound track, but the dolby digital plus does the trick for that sonic \\"oomph\\" you're looking for. All in all, the film itself excels at what it tries to do. A great film and great HD-DVD material.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|WARNING- SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />A dystopian tale set in 2027 and based on a novel by P.D. James, \\"Children of Men\\" takes place in a future where women suddenly become infertile. The world is tearing itself apart and the only sea of tranquility is Britain yet that tranquil sea is very much an illusion as the nation has turned into a police state where everyone must carry their passport to prove they are citizens or be shipped out to a war zone like concentration camp. Theo (Clive Owen) once an activist seems trapped in an emotional war zone of his own of apathy having never recovered from the death of his son nearly a decade before. His own emotions have become still born. When his ex-wife (Julianne Moore) the head of a radical terrorist group called The Fish asks for his help in smuggling a pregnant woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety, he is reluctantly drawn into her plan for the money but finds that his emotions immerge from their cocoon as well becoming the man he used to be.<br /><br />In a dreary year for science fiction films, \\"Children of Men\\" finally presents an oasis of memorable images, characters and observations. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n wisely turned down the chance to director the sequel to his \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" to helm this project. Brilliantly directed with a marvelous, rich screenplay by Cuar&oacute;n, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (one suspects that the bulk of the writers on these projects worked on earlier drafts that have little resemblance to the final product) the film uses the heavy handed imagery of P.D. James novel to its advantage. Clive Owen continues to prove he's a magnificent and underrated actor. He brings depth and presence to his world weary portrayal of Theo. The film features strong support performances by Danny Huston, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Caine adding a sense of gritty reality to the proceedings.<br /><br />The gritty look of the film is quite intentional as the director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\") wanted to make the audience feel as if they were seeing a realistic look at the future. As a result the film has both the gritty feel of a documentary in terms of the film grain but also in terms of the constant camera movement throughout the film.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />While there aren't a huge amount of special features many are worthwhile. First up we get three deleted scenes that run around 2 minutes. While none of them are essential at least two amplify the desperate situation that Theo finds  himself in; one features Theo's apartment manager showing up at his door for four months past due rent while another continues Theo's meeting with his cousin who is a member of the government and collects artwork.<br /><br />We also get \\"Children of Men Comments by philosopher Slavoj Zizek\\" which most folks are going to skip. While some of his observations are interesting, they're the type of observations that you'd hear in a basic philosophy class. I suppose they are included to give legitimacy to this science fiction film but his comments aren't necessary to recognize the power of this film.<br /><br />\\"Under Attack\\" highlights the long takes used throughout the film. We hear from star Owen, director Cuar&oacute;n and the producers discussing the difficulty in shooting the action sequences with these long fluid takes shot on location. Cuar&oacute;n's vision for the film required constant camera movement which doesn't allow the filmmakers to fake it as they might normally. In particular we see the sequence where Theo, his ex-wife and others attacked in the country in their car and how it was put together with physical effects allowing for a 12 minute uninterrupted take.<br /><br />\\"Theo and Julian\\" allows us to hear the actors Julianne Moore and Clive Owen's thoughts on their character. Director Cuar&oacute;n also chimes in on the collaborative nature of creating a character with his actors and integrating their suggestions into an already finished script. It's clear that he relishes the collaborative nature of film and that the performers that have worked with him enjoyed the project as well.<br /><br />\\"Futuristic Design\\" focuses on the production design with comments by producer Hilary Shor and how they had to straddle the line between the futuristic look of the film while also grounding it in our world. Jim Clay and Jennifer Williams the production designer and set designer respectively discuss how the natural instinct is to go for a visually strong look for a science fiction film. He suggested they fight that instinct create and use ugly environments that refer to our current world to bring home the gritty reality of the film as much as possible. Using London as their background the designers created a world that is as old and tired looking reflecting the biological sterility facing mankind but also reflects a world that is at the brink of collapse.<br /><br />\\"Visual Creating the Baby\\" highlights the delivery scene in the film. Created with CGI this sequence was difficult to shoot because they couldn't use a real baby for the sequence and had to use a combination of prosthetics, CGI and physical effects to create the sequence. Small details such as Theo's breath in the freezing room where the baby is delivered were created in post-production and digitally inserted.<br /><br />An effective, powerful science fiction thriller, \\"Children of Men\\" features a number of powerful performances from Owen's world weary take on Theo to Moore's activist Julian their performances bring gravity to the situations in the film adding another level suggesting this world is just around the corner from our own.of creating a character with his actors and integrating their suggestions into an already finished script.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|A fabulous CD.  I had seen her briefly on the Grammy Awards and took a chance on liking her and buying a CD.  Was not disappointed, she is fabulous and will watch for new CDs in the future.

Thousands of mate-in-2 problems, hundreds of combinations, and 600 miniature games of masters at your fingertips.  As a coach, I can almost exclusively use this book for material.  The only thing lacking is graphic description of the many tactics which erupt therein.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This is a truly awful movie that contains some fine acting, a fact which causes me to feel guilty about hating it so much.  With 290+ reviews, I'm not going to write anything of length, except to say that when you see the end of the movie, you'll be astonished that all the pseudo-virtuosic storytelling techniques--which made it so tediously complicated, a mental exercise nowhere approaching entertainment or edification--simply resulted in a display of the most banal stereotypes imaginable.  If you react like I did, you'll hate yourself for sticking with it to its incredibly trite end, because the payout, after a lot of labor, is really scant. <br /> <br />What a bore.
0765315246|5.0|A lot better than many movies put together. A fine blend of fresh thinking, fast action and interesting humor. Very enjoyable to the last page. Can't wait for more from this author.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|The Departed is a thinking person's \\"gangster\\" film.  It does a remarkable job showing us the dark side of human nature as people often struggle to better themselves - a lofty goal but done without guidance or morals. Matt Damon is at his best in this role filled with dualities.  Jack Nicholson proves once again that he is an actor's actor.  He is believable and powerful as the ruthless antagonist.  Leonardo DiCaprio is truly a sympathetic character, and he plays that role with heart-felt realism.  And Mark Wahlberg?  He may have done some different kinds of roles in the past, but he has certainly come into his own in this film.  His portrayal of the angst-filled, loyal tough guy is accurate and strong!  The movie moves along on a fairly fast track, keeping the audience on its toes.  The lighting is a wonderful enhancer to the intricacies of the plot - it guides you in and out of darkness.  Martin Scorsese knows how to do it!  In The Departed, he has surpassed himself by weaving a story where even the good guys make you nervous and the streets of any city start to look menacing!  It was time for the Academy to recognize his body of work, esp this one!
B000002AVF|5.0|It has some pop (Fantasy, Always Be My Baby), some R&B (Melt Away, Long Ago) and even some dance music (Fantasy, Daydream Interlude). From start to finish I can seriously listen to this CD. While Long Ago is the weakest track here, it doesn't make for a bad song. It just sounds a bit outdated.<br /><br />My favorites are:<br /><br />Underneath The Stars (one of the most powerfully-lulling melodies I've ever heard in mainstream music...)<br />Fantasy<br />Open Arms<br />When I Saw You<br />Daydream Interlude<br />and<br />Looking In.<br /><br />Don't miss out on Mariah's best album, right behind it?

0689865384|5.0|This book is gripping and fast paced. The main character, Tally, is strong and well drawn out. But there are 185 other reviews to tell you how great this book is. I just found out 20th Century Fox has announced they are making a movie adoptation from Uglies. I'm usually so disappointed when I actually see the finished product, but one can always hope. The movie is scheduled to come out sometime in 2008, so keep an eye out for it. But you really should read the whole trilogy first, each book is wonderful and exciting.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|Have you ever seen a movie and you want to see it over and over again? The Holiday is just that kind of movie.  This movie is about two women; Iris and Amanda who are played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz respectively. Amanda, a Los Angeles workaholic has just kicked her boyfriend out of her house because he cheated on her with his secretary and now she feels that she in dire need of change.  At the same time Iris, a British newspaper journalist finally realizes that the man she has been pining for for over three years does not love her. She learns that he is engaged and is devastated. She has lost who she believes is the love of her life and now can not seem to put the pieces back together.  Amanda goes online and finds a really cool website where she can basically switch house and lives with someone on the other side of the world. Amanda and Iris meet online and decide to swap lives for two weeks, just to get away from all that has been happening in their respective lives. <br />   Once in each others homes, Amanda thinks that she has made a huge mistake and tries to book a flight back to the life she has left. However, she soon changes her mind. Graham, played by Jude Law enters and suddenly things are looking up for Amanda. He sweeps her off of her feet in what they both expect to be a one night stands but it turns out to be a lot more. Iris too is having a great time in LA. She becomes friends with Amanda's neighbor and also a renowned screenwriter. This relationship is what helps her move on from her failed relationship.  She meets composer Miles who is played by Jack Black and he sweep her off her feet. Both women have entered new relationships in which they are happy and in love. However, they both have to soon go back to their lives and are faced with a decision. <br />  This movie is right up there with Nancy Meyers other movies namely What Women Want and Something's Got to Give.  Meyers have earned my respect for pulling off a movie that has two different plots. Two romance stories in one. This is definitely a treat for anyone who is a fan of romance comedies. It has the perfect blend of comedy and romance. I found it hilarious that Amanda jumps out of the limousine that was to take her to the airport and runs back to Graham's place in the snow in very high heels. I also found in delightful when Miles makes a special song for Arthur (Amanda's neighbor) so that he can have confidence when he goes onstage to receive his lifetime achievement award. This was funny because as soon as he hears the song its like he got new life and was able to overcome the flight of stairs. Plus the song was so cheerful that you couldn't help but laugh. It was very romantic in that Amanda was willing to run in heels to Graham's house and that she really bonds with Graham's children. It is also very romantic that Iris decides that her decision of whether to leave for England can wait until after the New Year.  <br />   This movie is definitely not the typical girl meets guy movie in that both of these women are not actively looking for love. In fact they are trying to avoid it as this is the exact reason why they both have switched lives. They both are not spending their time pinning that they do not have a boyfriend. They are just having a good time and love finds them. Also, what it not typical is the relationship that developed between Miles and Iris. No one would ever guess that they would be in a relationship. This is just a few of the things that make this movie not fall into the typical routine of boy meets girl. <br />   It is because of this that I would have to say that this movie has a story line that would keep anyone glued to their seats. It certainly kept me glued to mine. This movie is funny, lighthearted and good all round entertainment for the entire family. <br />   The Holiday reminds of Roman Holiday- one of Andrea Hepburn's movies in which she plays an Egyptian princess who tries to get away from the royal family whoshe finds to be very annoying. She is found on the street asleep by a character played by Gregory Peck, after being injected with some kind of sleep aid. She too unexpectedly falls in love after getting away from it all. This is one of America's all time romance movies. I would suggest putting this movie on your list as well. <br />     All four of the leads played their roles exceptionally well. I couldn't help but like them. It was such convincing acting that I found myself caught up in their prospective problems. This is quite a feat for any movie- to make the audience a part of the movie instead of just the person inside the movie theatre or on their couch passing time. Although the movie is approximately two hours long, it doesn't feel this way. In fact I would have been able to watch another half hour and not complain that the plot was drawn out. <br /> The Holiday is an awesome movie which I would recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy. The characters are lively, entertaining and convincing. In my opinion, this is all we can ask of acting. The combination of Winslet, Diaz, Law and Black made this movie a big success. It a movie I am sure I will be watching over and over again. In fact, I have already watched it twice since it came out on DVD. Watching the Holiday is a great way to spend time. I would undoubtedly give this movie five stars. You will not be disappointed after seeing this movie. <br />
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I never would have guessed that an 80 year old movie could be this good if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  I thought this movie was as entertaining as any Star Wars movie ever made. I loved the music, the actress playing Maria, and it's story full energy, tension, and imagination that has a happy ending. I'm not an old man who has a bias for these old throw-backs.  I'm a 22 year old college student who loves action packed films like the Matrix and Die Hard.  This movie is now one of my all time favorite films.<br /><br />I'm also not someone who dishes out 5 star reviews like candy (I have to be very impressed).  If you don't doubt me, go to the website rottentomatoes dot com and do a search of this film to see what the critics say about this movie. Or do a google search for the Kino version of Metropolis and go to their website which has a trailer of the film. This film is worth every penny that it costs.  It's an absolutely remarkable film that could very well change your opinions on silent films as it did me.  A MUST HAVE!
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Flaws first:  They could have cast anyone in the role played by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine; there is no explanation for the pandemic of infertility or for the hatred of refugees and immigrants. <br />What's worth watching:  the other actors give strong performances; the production design and camera work are stunning; the self-administered euthanasia pill called Quietus is a nice touch.
140679239X|5.0|Though this is an incredibly difficult read, it's worth it if you have the time and patience.  The story is in three parts, the first being a family planning a trip to a lighthouse, the second being a tragedy that occurs, and the third being the actual trip to the lighthouse. The story asks the questions, \\"Is man the sum of his experiences?\\" and \\"Is time the succession of a line of lampposts?\\"  I won't tell you the answers that Woolf provides or that I agree with them (she was certifiable and reading this book gives a glimpse into that tragic mind), but I will tell you that in between the sometimes laborious but skillful symbolism there is often a passage of beautifully poetic stream-of-consciousness prose.<br />As the masterpiece it is, 5 stars are not enough.<br /><br />J.

B00005JMXX|1.0|Sure, I know it is just a movie, but c'mon.  I mean, the North freezes in a day and suddenly the survivors are all fleeing into Mexico?  From what I've seen of the place I'd take my chances with a warm fire and a rock shelter, at least the melted glacier I drink from won't be tainted with human sewage!!      At least it shows that yes, wolves attack anything when they travel in packs and do attack just to attack and not just because \\"they are hungry\\".  It was nice to see the Zombies get swallowed up by a giant wave but c'mon, really now, do we want all the zombies to drown at the SAME TIME?  Quaid is a great actor and along with Sela Ward really give this show a good standing.  I just cannot give it five stars because it is obvious that it is politically motivated.  Now, if the facts are facts, that is one thing but c'mon, really now, why try and ram the message down our throats with a fictional tale of what it takes millions of years to happen (naturally, by mother nature, not by some guy driving a Barracuda down main) and pack it into an single day?   Of course even beyond that there is so much garbage to wade through.  Like, you know, I mean c'mon, so the Big Apple gets over 1,000 feet of icy layering and yet Quaid's character is still driving, then walking on even ground from PA?  C'mon now, at least show some climbing of cliffs or something.  Well and even when the ice does freeze like that (which it does at the Polar Ice cap, just ask Shackleton and his crew) is some high school bookworm really going to have the stamina to run all over town and try to save the world?  Unless those kids were Navy Brats or had studied merchant ships, they would not know the galley from the port side.  Pretty much a waste of time although I am sure Al Gore thought it was five stars ha ha ha.

In more simple terms, thing's change.  Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.  Having been a fan for the last 20 years (Freaky Styley) yes their have been some peaks and valley's. I've watched and listened while the band has grown, matured, and refined their songwriting and musical skills to a level that is pure expression.  A connection of words music and emotion, no separation between mind, ear, heart, sound and feel.  Getting John healthy and back in the band is the best thing that ever happened, musically, spiritually and otherwise.  I don't compare this to any of the other albums (yes I still call them albums, although now smaller and more expensive) Stagnation is something I find hard to tolerate in music, growth and evolution in a band and their music is a reflection of life and living, I don't know how to feel about someone who wants the same thing rehashed and spit out a regular interval. To call this \\"radio friendly\\" is just silly and easy.  Most of these song's will never see any significant airplay, and that's just fine with me (I DON'T LISTEN TO THE RADIO) Putting out a double disc set is a ballsy move in this instant gratification culture we have today. I try to listen to music and judge it on merit and seat of the pants feel; I don't expect to be blown away by every track. Desecration Smile may be the most beautiful song I've ever heard.   This collection in my opinion is smart and soulful, funky and full of diversity and expression, isn't that what art is supposed to be about?
032147404X|3.0|Don't like the humor - a little humor is fun - but this gets annoying, then turns distasteful. If the author needs be funny,,, try to write a funny book or find a stand-up club somewhere. <br />Too much on Wedding Photography - I can't think of a more stupid topic within photography.  <br />I liked the authors excellent photos.  <br />
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Donizetti's enchanting comedy 'L'Elisir d'Amore' has rarely been performed with such panache and sense of fun as this beautiful evening captured during a live performance of the Otto Schenk/J&uuml;rgen Roseat production at the Vienna Staatsoper on this sparkling DVD.<br /><br />Conductor Alfred Eschw&eacute; enjoys every minute of this bubbling score and the orchestra is especially sensitive to his subtle demands.  The raison d'etre for creating this live recording is obviously the inimitable harmony of the leads Rolando Villaz&oacute;n as Nemorino and Anna Netrebko as Adina.  These two handsome and talented singer/actors share a magnetism that is gracing the opera houses around the world and having seen them before only in dramatic roles on stage, it is rewarding to find they both share a flair for comedy, not only in their interaction with each other but also in their total professionalism of sharing the sense of ensemble. They are a dream match.<br /><br />It is difficult to imagine a more tenderly sung 'Una furtiva lacrima' (and here the audience obviously agrees, demanding an encore!) than Villaz&oacute;n offers.  But that is one of the highlights everyone expects.  It is the manner of delivery of the entire opera that makes the Villaz&oacute;n/Netrebko duo work such magic.  They are ably supported by the Dulcamara of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the Sergeant Belcore of the dependable Leo Nucci.  Sets, costumes, acting, orchestral timbre and of course gorgeous singing make this an opera DVD well worth owning.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 07
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Having seen three of the shows on Discovery, our only question is which version of the DVD set to get; it is that visually amazing!  Question: I have heard that HD DVDs have a \\"flip side\\" for normal DVD players; can anyone confirm this.
B00003CXCW|5.0|A crazed aged actress played with moxie by Gloria Swanson entices a struggling scriptwriter to live in her insane mansion in a film that combines satire and horror. The writer, played by a disaffected, cynical William Holden, enters the belly of the beast and makes what becomes a deal with the devil. Part Blanche Dubois, Swanson plays a faded actress, a \\"sleepwalker,\\" who lives in the past. The cynical tone of the film amazingly reminds me of the dead narrator who speaks in Desperate Housewives, a technique used in the film's voice-over. It's weird seeing the same Los Angeles roads and buildings from 60 years ago, virtually unchanged today. In fact, the film is not at all dated.
1582701709|1.0|On a flight the woman next to me was reading The Secret. I've seen the book before, and read the jacket, and asked her what she thought. She said she was reading it for a book club, and that as she was content, the book didn't say much. She let me read it, and I got a good dose of it but had a difficult time differentiating one page from another. How many ways can one say JUST BE HAPPY? The book is repetitive, and full of sentimental thought that offers no concrete answer. I guess I'm also content with my life as a husband and father, but still...that such a book can be so popular boggles the mind. If a person reads this book, tells themselves they are happy, they may believe it for a while but sooner or later they will realize they are lonely, stressed, or miserable, for reasons within themselves. I guess I'm bothered by the fact that so many people can find solace in such a book, and yet the world, in general, ignores far more important issues. Books like this sell out, people watch Dr. Phil, and the writings of someone like, say, Ryszard Kapucinski, for example, slowly become out of print and forgotten except among certain members of the literary establishment. Self-happiness, certainly, is a function of a benevolent society, but a placebo is not the answer.
B000LE1GVW|3.0|This disk is enjoyable, but most of it is pretty mellow compared with \\"New Shoes\\".  If that song is the reason you are buying the disk, listen to the whole thing first, you might avoid disappointment.  With regards to the rest of the disk, it's a solid performance, but not spectacular. I have a feeling this will be one of those disks that I won't listen to much after a few months. <br /> <br />One of the reasons I gave it 3 stars (instead of 4) is the stupid way the final track is on the disk.  The last track is 15 minutes long and has three songs. Why not separate them? I hate when artists play games like this?
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I rented this movie for $1, and when it was done, said, \\"Well, I lost a dollar, and two hours of my life.\\"  My husband's review:  \\"I'd rather be tortured than watch that movie again.\\" <br /> <br />It was one of the worst we've ever seen.  It started out well, and had that cute little girl actress who was in both Smallville and Supernatural, but as another reviewer said, \\"the plot was tangled beyond repair,\\" and I think that's a good way to describe it.  We found ourselves wishing it would end, and then it just continued to drag on and on.  The CGI was really inferior too. <br /> <br />And we thought Dark Water was bad!!
B000K4WPCC|2.0|Yesss.... lots and lots of really hot people.. but the move sucked.
B000MV9026|5.0|My daughter and myself view the movie at the theater and we also bought the dvd. We where pleased it was very funny and entertaining some say preachy I say informative children as well as adults need to see the impack of our actions do to the wild life as well as echo system. We love it on all counts. I wish people would lighten up and enjoy the film and learn a little at the same time. <br />
B000K2QL8I|5.0|Till The Sun Turns Black is the second terrific album by singer/songwriter Ray LaMontagne, whose first wonderful album, was Trouble (2004).  Ray is not a cheerful or sunny soul (you must have gotten a hint of that from the title, no?).  Rather, like Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison, Kelly Joe Phelps, he mostly mines the caves of sadness, loss, weariness, lassitude, and sorrow.  He sings in a hushed and plaintive voice which is like the far off sounds of a train, mournful and distant.  Don't get me wrong, Ray is wonderful to hear, just don't spin this disc if you are already feeling a bit, shall we say, desperate.  Or then again, maybe you should.  Just maybe his own wretched misery would be enough to make you say, \\"Hey, at least I don't feel THAT bad.\\"  But joking, aside, this album, despite being slightly tarnished by too much fancy strings and orchestral sounding background, has some truly stellar gems.<br /><br />The song \\"Empty\\" is sheer poetry:<br /><br />\\"lay your blouse across the chair,<br /><br />let fall the flowers from your hair<br /><br />and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain.<br /><br />outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves,<br /><br />to me it sounds like they're applauding us the quiet love we made.<br /><br />will i always feel this way?<br /><br />so empty, so estranged\\"<br /><br />Buy the album for \\"Empty\\" but stay and listen to the whole thing.  It is well worth it.  Thank you Mr. LaMontagne.

1582701709|1.0|This book is irresponsible in that it implies one can heal one's cancer, vision problems (even blindness) by just not focusing on the negative and thinking about the positive. While I'm all for the power of positive thinking and believe it can be helpful, it is completely irresponsible to imply that that is all one might need medically.<br /><br />There really is no secret and after reading this, I felt taken for a ride. All they are really saying is that the universe gives you what you spend the most time thinking about and it doesn't know the difference between something that might be negative and something that is positive. So, if you spend a lot of time dwelling on and thinking about the negative things that you fear, that is what you will get in life. If on the ther hand you spend a lot of time concentrating on the positive, that is what the universe will give you because you've spent more time focusing on the positive.<br /><br />You do not need to spend the money on this product to learn this. The secret is that there is no 'secret'. It's all hype to try to get you to spend your hard earned money on this expensive product, which by the way they state will be an entire ongoing series.
B000063DFN|3.0|Iron Maiden will forever f***ing rule the planet. With POWERSLAVE being their 3rd best album, and a 2nd powerslave tour planned in 2008, Maiden have a whole lot ahead of them. They have 14 great albums out, and I have 4 of them so far: Powerslave, A Matter Of Life And Death, Dance of Death, and Brave New World.<br /><br />However, I'd have to say the opposite about this newly-released version of POWERSLAVE. The tracks are seperated, the audio is a bit off unlike the CD version released before this, and there is an even bigger problem: After Back In The Village, thing with the drums and the howling is supposed to be at the beginning of Powerslave. And not only that, I noticed some of the tracks are mixed.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great album.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is fantastic. We have our entire family over each Thanksgiving and enjoy the tradition of watching a new movie after dinner. Everyone loved this movie! From the 2 year old kids to the 75 year old Great grandparents, the movie was a hit! Our nascar loving uncle really enjoyed it too!. the picture and sound are top notch. The story is terrific, and the DVD extras are actually worth watching.
B000E8NRR6|3.0|I think this album needs a fair amount of listening to appreciate (I HOPE!).  It's better with each playing so I guess I'm still undecided but generally liking the music.  DEFINITELY not as accessible as Kamakiriad. <br /> <br />Audio quality is great.  Fagen's 'dry' vocals are very crisp.  The surround mix is not overdone and is very clear.  If you like Donald Fagen and surround music, this disk is worth getting.
0142501123|5.0|We love this book and enjoy reading it to our 3 year old son. It will be a tradition to pull this book out around Halloween time and read it to him for years to come. The story is cute and the artwork is fantastic. The text is easy to read and the story length is just right for children to keep their attention. This would be great for teachers or day care workers to read to their children too. The book arrived quickly as usuual, and in good condition from the delivery.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is repackaged Shirley McLaine, Dan Brown, ad infinitum.<br /><br />Why don't these books address the problem of human suffering and evil?<br /><br />If we are all really God, why haven't we solved the world's problems yet?<br /><br />Don't you find it curious that the 25 or so authors Byrne thanks in her acknowledgments are all a part of the same new-age, positive thinking, market-yourself-as-God sect she is a part of? It's all one big-group hug.<br /><br />Every few years, the same types of goobly-gook books arrive to tickle our ears and pull on our desires for unlimited wealth, peace, happiness, and security. All sell the same lie, \\"When you eat this fruit, you will become like God.\\"<br /><br />Why does the trailer for The Secret look like the opening moments of National Treasure with Nicholas Cage? (Am I alone in this...puhleez?!)<br /><br />Instead of expecting the universe to come to you and drop the all the health, wealth, and pleasure into your lap, why not go out and serve the weak, downtrodden, grieving, and broken-hearted?<br /><br />This will make the world a better place instead of this new age tripe.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|I was introduced to Young's music more than 30 years ago - I was barely 14 then. Of course, the album was \\"Harvest\\". I soon got hold of nearly all of the Loner's then available lp's. \\"After The Gold Rush\\", \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" and \\"Tonight's The Night\\" rapidly took their place up there in my personal Pantheon. There was enough to fulfill a melancholy teenager in that music: from the violent despair of \\"Down By The River\\" (my favourite) through the jangly \\"Tell Me Why\\" to the sad loneliness of \\"Albuquerque\\". Then Punk came by and I sort of let Neil down... <br />Nostalgia crept in some 15 years ago and now this, \\"Live at Massey Hall\\". All I can say is that Young's unparalleled artistry shines throughout its 17 tracks. Stripped-down versions of \\"Old Man\\", A Man Needs A Maid\\" and \\"There's A Word\\" are vastly superior to those to be found on \\"Harvest\\". Less known/never realeased numbers like \\"On The Way Home\\", \\"Bad Fog Of Loneliness\\" are first rate material. <br />What baffles me most now that I am much older is the maturity of Young's lyrics - remember he was only 25 at the time! There's something about the passing of time in them  - \\"Old Man\\", \\"Journey Through The Past\\" spring to mind - that wouldn't seem out of place in songs written by someone twice his age. <br />Anyway, this record also brings back memories of days gone by - Hello Annelise, Barbara and countless others, may be you're out there somewhere reading this! <br />All we have to do now is wait for the next opening up of the NY vaults. In the meantime, we can rely on \\"Live at Massey Hall\\" to make the wait bearable.

014028009X|5.0|I have never laughed so hard as I did during Helen Fielding's brilliant take on society, single women, married women, men and embarrassing mums. I am convinced that \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" is the perfect post-modern riposte to the nineteenth century \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"<br /><br />I don't know how anyone could come out of this not loving Bridget. And Mark Darcy. And Shaz and Jude and Tom, but of course loathing Daniel and the irrepressible Pam Jones.<br /><br />I read this book long before the movie came out and I am so glad. The movie was just...okay. But the book was impossible to put down. My copy is dog-eared and nearly worn out, the pages stained with my tears of mirth as I shrieked over Fielding's wit.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I am very happy with this collectors  edition dvd and cannot fault it in any respect.The package is excellent overall and good value.
B000021YQV|5.0|Being the devoted metalhead that I'am today, I'll honestly say that I'm not a big fan of nu metal whatsover. Normally I'm a huge fan of death metal bands such as Deicide, Death, Morbid Angel, Nile, Krisiun, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, and thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Testament, Kreator, Sepultura, Anthrax, Exodus, Overkill, Megadeth, and so forth. However System of a Down are one of the better nu metal bands out there, heck I wouldn't even consider these guys as nu metal (I would consider them as hard rock or alternative metal) because they are very good at what they do, and they do it a whole lot better than all of the other crappy nu bands out there. Their 2001 masterpiece Toxicity is just an incredible mindblowing album. While not as good as their 1998 self titled debut, but this album is pure gold nonetheless. I mean this is one of those albums along with \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" by Pantera, \\"Reign in Blood\\" by Slayer, \\"Beneath the Remains\\" by Sepultura, and so forth that I can just listen to over and over again and never ever get tired of it no matter how many times I listen to it. Producer Rick Rubin does a fantastic job with producing this album. What separates SOAD from most god awful nu metal bands are two things: GOOD musicianship, and GOOD lyrics (not the typical I hate mommy and daddy garbage). SOAD's lyrics are mostly pollitically charged and not only do they make you think at times, but they also make you laugh at other times as well. Serj Tankian's are very awesome on here. He can go from an crazy insane rant like shout to a cool melodic singing voice. Daron Malakian is without question far more superior than any other nu metal axeman alive. His weird yet great heavy riffs are just down right catchy and they'll make you bounce and bang your head like crazy. He also does good backing vocals too. Shavo Odadjian has some pretty cool bass lines on here (listen to \\"Prison Song\\" for instance). John Dolmayan's drumming is fast, energetic, and just downright crazy.<br /><br />Here are some of the highlights of the album:<br /><br />The opeing track \\"Prison Song\\" is a fast energetic, catchy opener with fast raging riffs and hard boucing drums to boot. Lyrically this song deals with of course politics, prisons, police corruption, and everything else wrong with the legal system. This is one of the best songs on here and of my favorites as well. Track two \\"Needles\\" is another fast catchy number with a hilarious chorus. \\"Deer Dance\\" is another great track that follows the same subject matter in \\"Prison Song\\" this time in a more serious fashion. There's even some riot topics thrown into the mix. Track four \\"Jet Pilot\\" is another favorite that starts off with Serj angrily ranting over a barrage of fast thrashing riffs and fast pounding drums. And of course let's not forget about \\"Chop Suey\\" the album's first single of course. Man, words just cannot describe how catchy and addicting this song really is. This is without a doubt the best song on the entire album, and it's another one of my favorites on here as well. \\"Bounce\\" is a short but fast energetic number that will make the listener like the song title says bounce. Track eight \\"Forest\\" is another one of my favorites on here which includes some great headbanging riffs that will make you feel like you've been bodyslammed in a wrestling ring. Another one of my favorites and of course my personal favortite that being track twelve \\"Toxicity\\". Lyrically this song deals with city life and the poisons in it. The lyrics on this song are just pure bliss to me, and Serj's vocals are great as well. Track thirteen \\"Psycho\\" (crazy song title eh) I believe deals with crazed cocaine groupies. There's also a cool guitar solo from Daron included. The closing track \\"Aerials\\" is a nice slow rocker with great singing vocals from Serj that are pure bliss. Great album closer bottom line.<br /><br />Here's the entire song list and the ratings:<br /><br />1. Prison Song (3:21) - 5/5<br /><br />2. Needles (3:13) - 5/5<br /><br />3. Deer Dance (2:55) - 5/5<br /><br />4. Jet Pilot (2:06) - 5/5<br /><br />5. X (1:58) - 5/5<br /><br />6. Chop Suey (3:30) - 5/5<br /><br />7. Bounce (1:54) - 5/5<br /><br />8.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|I saw this movie recently. The storyline is good where the two leading ladies exchange places for holiday, Cameron Diaz richer of the two comes to stay in Kate Winslets house and vice-versa. Kate immedialtely finds diaz's lifestyle exciting and comfortable while Diaz decides she is not enjoying Kate's lifestyle. When she is about to go she has a one night thing with Jude Law and she gets increasingly drawn to Law.   Off the cast, Kate plays the role of Iris with utmost ease. Her body language, her timing in the entire movie is perfect. And she is beautiful.  Cameron Diaz is perfect one of the few actresses who do comedy without any difficulties. All her movies I have seen, Mask, My Best Friend's Wedding, There's Something About Mary, Charlies Angels 1 & 2 she has always proved herself  Jack Black I believe has much more potential than what he did in this movie  Eli Wallach as long-forgotten author has also potrayed a nice character  Finally Jude Law  I had seen his Sky Captain and world of tomorrow and I must confess that I did not like him much then. However this movies was different. The chemistry he shares with Diaz is awesome. As a man with no strings attached and as a father to two daughters he plays the role par excellence. The last scene which he is shown crying is too perfect. I would like to think he has not used glycerine or anything like that. Due to this movie I saw his another good movie Cold Mountain. He is really awesome  If you like the leading ladies and Jude Law this movie is a treat. If you dont like them watch it on an afternoon with hot chocolate or a cup of coffee with some one you love you will enjoy it
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre has had a profound effect on me since I first read the book as a young girl and I have watched every single movie adaption made.  <br /> <br />I must admit that when I heard that yet another version of Jane Eyre was coming out I was a little dubious. After all there have been countless versions made.  <br />Until now my favourite has been the 1983, Timothy Dalton version. <br />But this movie...quite literally blew me out of the water. The little changes from the book did nothing to detract from the sheer, exquisite beauty of the story.  <br />Toby Stephens as Rochester stole my heart, with the perfect combination of gruffness, pride, cynicism, tenderness and heartwrenching sadness.  Ruth Wilson as Jane Eyre was the exactly as I have always seen her in my minds eye.  She is exquisite without being conventionally beautiful, eloquent without saying a word. Strong and upright without being self rightoeus. I cannot imagine anyone more perfect for the role. <br /> <br />The 4 hours seemed to fly by and each moment was better than the next. The scenery was spectacular, locations (Ie Thorfield Hall) were evocative and just perfect... <br />I will buy my own copy of this movie the moment it hits the shelves and I am already eager to watch it again.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I have a better idea...Go and Watch this for yourself and you will feel the magic!!! <br />10 Stars!!!
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  <br />Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned <br />Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  <br />The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. <br />Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  <br />Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. <br />And the end is kind of loose.  <br />Give it a miss
6305882592|5.0|In the same way that John Denver was a perfect match for the Muppets, so too does the music of Cat Stevens match the spirit of this film. The combination is unique. <br /> <br />I know that's a bit of a weird review, but then again, this is a bit of a weird film. And, I hope you are now motivated to check it out.
B000LC55F2|5.0|After reading lot of reviews on Amazon.com, I finally got to see this movie. I haven't seen much of Christian Bale. But I would definitely say 10/10 for Hugh Jackman. This guy has got a class <br />The movie begins with two friends (Bale & Jackman) who are kind of disciples to Michael Caine. Michael Caine is a magician where he performs usual tricks and then there is one trick where the Jackman's wife bounded by ropes is thrown into tank full of water and within few seconds she comes out. On one such night, Bale ties a wrong knot on Jackman's wifes hand and she drowns in the tank not able to open the knot. <br />Here begins the rivalry between the two guys. Each is trying to outsmart the other. Like one of the reviewer said it would be too much to describe as it has lot of twist and turns from here.  <br />And I don't want to give away the surprises in the movie as they are fun to watch. Finally one such trick is the transported man (going through one door and coming out of other which is half a feet away in hardly one second) which Bale performs with finesse. But if Bale's character has talent, Jackman's character has showmanship. He does the same with much more style. How ever one day Bale spoils Jackmans act.  <br />Now Jackman decides to outsmart Bale and that is where the movie goes on dark side.  <br />Just watch it from here. Its thrilling <br />Of the cast. <br />As I said this is first Bale's movie that I have seen and he definitely stands out leaving no room for criticism <br />Michael Caine is too good. I believe even if he is given a cameo role he would stand out. <br />Scarlett Johansson is wasted  <br />Hugh Jackman again!!!! He is has done this role with precision and perfection. His class, showmanship and his aura in general are too good. Treat for Jackman fans. Actually it's not only about Jackman. It's the synchronization between him and Bale that's wonderful. See this movie for these two guys and Michael Caine. <br />I wonder why Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale were not nominated this year for academy.  <br />This is not the first time Hugh Jackman has given  a fine performance. His Kate and Leopold and Someone Like You are among the nicest movies I have seen. Then of course there is the X-men series and Van Helsing <br />
032147404X|5.0|Just bought my first digital SLR and this book is amazing.  Just about everything I need to know, plus some extras.  I found the perfect printer in here also.  Great book!!
B000MU6M3C|5.0|I found the book to be not only user (and Earth) friendly, but really inspiring. The author's illustrations and supplimental photographs reinforce the clear directions. I'm really excited about involving my family in this marriage of art, sustainance and practicality.
B000AM1TGC|5.0|Recorded in June/July of 1975 (soon after Peter Gabriel left Genesis), this debut solo album by Steve more or less pointed in the direction that Genesis would travel following the Lamb Lies down on Broadway (1974).  The album was also somewhat successful and reached No. 26 in England and No. 191 in America, which was a source of encouragement for the guys in Genesis (they were recording A Trick of the Tail at the time). More importantly however, Voyage of the Acolyte gave Steve an opportunity to record music that had been dismissed by some of the guys in Genesis.<br /><br />Joining Steve (electric and acoustic guitars; mellotron; harmonium, bells, autoharp, vocal, effects) were Genesis mates Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, Taurus bass pedals, fuzz 12-string); and Phil Collins (drums, percussion, vibes, vocals); along with Steve's brother John Hackett (flute, ARP synthesizer, bells); keyboardist John Acock (Elka Rhapsody, mellotron, harmonium, piano); Sally Oldfield (vocal); Robin Miller (oboe, cor anglais); and Nigel Warren-Green (cello).  For those of you Brand X fans out there (like me) Percy Jones contributes an excellent bass part on A Tower Struck Down.  The musicians on this album are all excellent and I loved hearing Phil's drumming, not to mention his vocal contributions.  Steve of course, shines throughout and his playing is both delicate and adventurous.<br /><br />The eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'34\\" to 11'45\\" - the pieces are all superb and it is clear that Steve was (and is) an excellent composer.  This is a very well recorded and soft album loaded with dreamy mellotron and warm synthesizer tones all over the place.  Steve contributes some absolutely gorgeous and haunting acoustic guitar pieces and the proggy group workouts on tracks like Star of Sirius are a great deal of fun to listen to.  All of the tracks flow together nicely and seem to form a larger work of sorts.  I have to admit that this is easily my favorite Genesis - related solo album.<br /><br />This was a well recorded album to begin with and the sound quality is simply excellent.<br /><br />Voyage of the Acolyte ultimately gave Steve the impetus he needed to break off from Genesis (after having his ideas squashed) and strike out on his own.  A simply superb album that is very highly recommended along with the Genesis albums A Trick of the Tail (1976) and the moody Wind and Wuthering (1976).  By the way, Wind and Wuthering would be Steve's last album with Genesis and presents some of his finest playing with the group.This was a well recorded album to begin with and the sound quality is simply excellent.

B000MXPE74|5.0|If you haven't given them a try, now's the time and choose Costello Music! <br />It's worth every penny in a time when music is rarely worth more than 99 cents for the one song you'll like.  <br />I bought this album ONLY because I liked the sound of \\"Flathead\\" on the Ipod commercial. I thought \\"Great, spending 10 bux on a cd I'll like one song from\\". WRONG! I quickly fell in love with \\"Henrietta\\" and now I play the cd almost nonstop on my Ipod and my home PC. It's that good.  <br /> <br />With some bands you hear them sing and you know they're just mouthing the words (Jayhawks for instance) with the Fratellis you feel the music, energy, and excitement these guys put into their songs. They're true artists! <br /> <br />If these guys keep up the energy they'll surely sweep the nation as one of the best bands for 2007. A+ guys!

B000NA28I4|3.0|When the novel [[ASIN:044023848X Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)]] was first published I resisted reading it for the longest time; there was nothing about it that sounded new and interesting.  Sure, it was a self-published hit written by a home-schooled teenager, but other than that the novel sounded like a mish-mash of different fantasy sterotypes I'd read dozens of times before.  Then, someone gave it to for a birthday present and since I would never insult that person by not reading the novel I sat down one weekend and poured through the story.  Was my opinion changed?  No.  As I thought, it was a mish-mash of fantasy sterotypes and a story obviously written by a child, with a child's viewpoint on the world.  I'll grant Christopher Paolini this:  he did create interesting characters in the likes of Eragon and Saphira, but that did not save the derivative story.  Regardless of the praise Paolini has been given, he is not the reincarnation of J. R. R. Tolkien; he is not Terry Brooks reimagined; he is not the heir to Robert Jordan. <br /> <br />When I sat down to watch the movie version of the novel, I came away understanding why the film was not the success the studio had hoped it would be.  The screenwriter took a mish-mash of a novel and turned it into an even bigger mish-mash of a movie.  While the film keeps the basic premise and characters of the novel, it deviates in many ways.  So much so that it barely resembles the novel upon which it is based.  Add to that some wooden acting from usually-good actors like Jeremy Irons and Djimon Honsou along with sub-par special effects and you get a movie even fans would not enjoy.  I will grant that unknown-until-now Edward Speleers was an engaging young actor with some talent and a perfect choice for the role of Eragon. He really is the saving grace of this poorly adapted film and if he can survive the failure of Eragon he just might have an acting future. <br />
B00005JPLU|3.0|Frank Miller's graphic novel come to life on the big screen doesn't live up to the promise of Sin City.<br /><br />The art direction is phenomenal and the Spartans, led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), are imposing physical specimens of perfection - ripped abs, blazing scars, and piercing eyes.  The scenes where the Spartans line up like models at a fitness photo shoot are imposing.  The scenes of brilliantly choreographed combat are equally memorable, filling the screen with beautiful brutality, and images of desperate courage.  It looked like the living comic book of a heroic tale when viewed without the story and when viewed in absence of the on-screen caricatures of the Persian Army.<br /><br />That's where the problems begin.  Reality, in this case, is more amazing than fiction.  The movie pitted depravity against character by making modern moral judgments apply to ancient times.  It presupposes that homosexuality and gender confusion is such a feared 'condition' that the audience will side with the Spartans who are free of its taint.  When truth be told, the Spartans engaged in the deplorable acts of incest and pedophilia to an extent at least as great and perhaps greater than the Persians and that sexual identity wasn't part of the issues of battle during that time.  Frank Miller rewrote history to make a modern-day bigoted comment in a completely inappropriate manner.<br /><br />Why wouldn't the truth stand as banner to the bravery of the 300 of Thermopylae?  The truth that the Persians as invaders needed to be stopped and the Hot Gate, a small pass from the beach into Sparta was the best defensible position is dramatic enough. There is no doubt that King Leonidas undertook one of the most inspired, brilliant, and courageous last stands in the history of warfare.  There is no doubt that the Spartans were the most well-trained soldiers of the time.<br /><br />Knowing these truths there was no perceivable reason, other than propaganda, to politicize the war so much.  The council wasn't against Leonidas, the army hadn't stood down, the citizenry hadn't given up hope.  He delayed the bulk of Xerxes forces long enough for the rest of the army to assemble, get into position and fight against the invaders.  He stood his men in front of the juggernaut and laid down his and their lives for his people and his lands.  He led by example and died with honor, not backstabbed by councilmen with agendas filling some imaginary role substitution Miller created to make an anti-peace statement deriding our own present-day Congress.  The Persians were human and they didn't force any more slaves into their war than the Greeks conscripted on their own side.  The Persians weren't transgendered freaks and demons.  Dehumanization of one's enemy is a propagandist's trick, not used by great chroniclers of which Miller is not.<br /><br />The individual historical inaccuracies are many - too many for this short review.  The propaganda is thick and sickening, a movie made as a modern-day recruiting film, not a work of art or a worthy historical lesson, even dramatized as it could've been.<br /><br />The Art Director should be given royalties, but the director and writer ought to be fired.<br /><br /> - CV Rickze the war so much.

B000FIMG68|5.0|Unpredictable, exciting, full of surprises, and engaging characters are just a few of the reasons Lost is my favorite television show. It is the show that made me watch television again. I truly do not understand when people say the second season was a bit of a slump from the exceptional first season. I think it is a more than worthy continuation. The second season builds the island mythology (the secrets of the hatch) while enriching it's characters with new views into their personal lives. It also introduces a handful of new characters. Which brings me to the character of Ana Lucia played by Michelle Rodriguez. A lot of people did not like her too much, but I didn't mind her. She was certainly flawed, but to not like her just because she isn't nicey nice and cutesy like most of the Stepford Wife female characters of TV is no reason to hate her. I found her compelling and interesting. The major plot twist involving her and another new character was one of the most shocking moments I ever experienced watching TV. Who knew that was going to happen? Some mysteries get resolved (like what Kate did that made her a fugitive) while others just begin (the character of Ben/Henry is introduced). And speaking of Kate, was it me or did they soften her character this season? The \\"do I like Sawyer or Jack?\\" subplot grew stale quickly, and I just thought this is not the Kate I knew from the first season. Thankfully, season three has brought back the Kate I love. (Evangeline...call me!) The DVD transfer of picture and sound could not be better. The extras are interesting (particularly the six degree game). And the final episode...wow! What a cliffhanger. Love, love, love this show!

B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is a great disc if you feel like you've forgotten your Beatles.  It misses a few tracks but covers a lot of ground.  The biggest disappointment is that it doesn't sound that good.  A lot of the recordings are flat and lacking in dynamics, and they sound like whoever was remastering them was not paying attention.  I find myself rarely listening to this as a result of the poor sound quality, a true disappointment.    For a real sonic treat (in terms of audio quality) check out the Love remix disc which has some great remixes and absolutely stellar audio quality.
079073639X|1.0|One wonders what happened to this movie that could have turned it into such a shaggy dog. The cast is first rate(Dustin Hoffman , Samuel L. Jackson , Sharon Stone) and a first rate director in Barry Levinson, but the sum doesn't equal the whole in this mess. <br />   A recently found spaceship in the ocean is found to be 300 years old and still working it appears. So a group is sent to check it out. They find smoke and mirrors but very little substance as this movie unfolds , and it takes 2 & 1/2 HOURS to get to the weakest ending of a movie in a long time!!!!!! <br />   This shows signs of production problems and even post filming cuts and still it comes down to great talent wasted on a movie that wouldn't pass muster as a Saturday morning cartoon much less a major motion picture.

However, the characters are developed at a good pace, just enough to keep wanting for more at the end of each chapter.  The lead characters are interesting and intriguing in revealing their back stories.  All in all a good read, definitely worth your time.
0316172324|5.0|If you wanted to sum up Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\", I would tell you to see the very first \\"Star Wars\\" movie. Remember in 1977 when Luke Skywalker while piloting his fighter hears Obi-Wan Kenobi tell him to turn off his radar while attacking the evil star ship? Obi-Wan wants Luke to rely on the FORCE. In other words, give up his conscious thought patterns and go with your gut.<br /><br />This is what BLINK is all about. Our ability to instantly know what is real from what is fiction. What is good from what is bad? Gladwell is telling us to go with our right (creative) brain, and for the moment to shut down our left (logical, analytical) brain, and oh he is so right.<br /><br />In example after example, the author goes through diverse instances where people in just the time it takes to BLINK, can make FABULOUS decisions that turn out to be the right ones. Others using the power of their analytical minds can take days, weeks, and even months, and come to the wrong decision. There's something going on here, and Gladwell is onto it. Human beings have five million years of evolutionary history behind us, and consciousness for only the last 15,000 or 20,000 years.<br /><br />Somehow, we have TURNED OFF the power of our unconscious instinctual patterns, and overridden them with our super analytical ways of logic. The result is inferior decisions to what we had before we became conscious. Hey, when a lion was chasing down our ancestors for a meal, you didn't have much time to think.<br /><br />By the way, every page of this relatively short book is fascinating. You will literally not be able to put it down. Let's look at a few of the topics that Gladwell covers in depth and convincingly.<br /><br />A) The J. Paul Getty Museum & the Kouros Statue<br /><br />The cash-flushed Getty Museum wanted to buy a 7-foot Greek statue for $10 million. With contract in hand they call in some of the greatest experts in the world who after running exhaustive scientific tests, agree that it's the real thing and you should jump to buy it. At the same time a handful of other experts just looking at the object instantly announce it's a fake, and you should walk away. Learn who was right and why. Hint: it took 2 seconds of looking to KNOW the answer.<br /><br />B) Who's a good Professor in less than 30 seconds<br /><br />Remember when we went to college we would attend a lecture or two to determine if we wanted to take the entire course with a certain professor. In BLINK you will see scientific studies that prove you can come to the same decision by watching a video of the professor for 30 seconds. Who's kidding whom?<br /><br />C) What if you could tell how long a potential marriage would last?<br /><br />This one is mind blowing. John Gottman of the University of Washington has shown in tests that he can do this with accuracy. Watching one hour of a couple talking, and Gottman can tell with 95% accuracy if 15 years later, they will still be married. Blink goes into it in detail. Too bad, I didn't learn about this study sooner.<br /><br />D) Why do some doctors get sued, and others not at all?<br /><br />You would think that the risk of being sued if you are a doctor is all about making mistakes, or improper medical care. BLINK shows that its really about words like \\"RUSHED, IGNORED, and TREATED POORLY.\\"<br /><br />E) Can a President of the United States be elected on looks alone?<br /><br />Read BLINK and you will see how an entire nation got suckered into electing Warren Warding President just for that reason, unbelievable but true. Read how and why, and be mesmerized.<br /><br />F) Only 14.5% of men are six feet and over. Why are 58% of CEO's six feet, or taller?<br /><br />Pretty wild when you think about it, yet true. Could there be some kind of unwritten or unconscious criteria for being a Fortune 500 CEO that involves height? There aren't enough tall people to COMPLETELY staff any one company. Why is it that the tall ones seem to rise to the TOP?<br /><br />G) Blue Team versus Red Team<br /><br />This is my personal favorite. The American military runs war games all the time. The good guys who are us are always the BLUE Team. The enemy is always the RED team. In preparation for the first Iraq war in the early 1990's, the government ran the exercise, and put General Paul Van Riper in charge of the bad guys, the RED team.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the bad guys blew away the good guys, the Americans by using unconventional \\"BLINK\\" type thinking, while the BLUE Team relied on conventional, overwhelming force, and inside the Beltway type bureaucratic thinking. This illustrates why this book is so important. You will learn out of the box type thinking.<br /><br />You will also learn when to use it, and when to go with your logical left brain type thinking. By the way in the war exercise when the bad guys, the RED Team beat the good guys the BLUE Team with ease, what did the Pentagon do? They announced that the game would be done over again, and they outlawed the techniques that the bad guys the RED Team employed.<br /><br />The result, the good guys won. The problem is that nobody told the bad guys in Iraq during the second Iraq War that these techniques were outlawed, and thus our Generals as usual find themselves in some difficulty to say the least. Read BLINK, and find out how and why. This book is FASCINATING, and NOT TO BE PUT DOWN, ONCE YOU START READING IT.<br /><br />Richard Stoyeckt?

B000MVN8HE|5.0|This is a surprisingly good show. It manages to have 'a little' violence, sex, and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid, and it's still intelligent enough to be interesting, humorous and kind of addicting to an adult. A modern Nancy Drew, is Veronica Mars. I wish seasons 1 and 2 were here; I wish anything more were here and I'd get that as well. I'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest, I prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent TV to sell me in that genre so I bought VM season 3 just for kicks. I'm glad I did.

0743298020|4.0|I read this book completely on the plane ride down to Miami recently.  To say that \\"time flies\\" when reading this is accurate.  This novel if nothing else is a good old fashioned story. One that immediately pulls you in and although at times may flag, you simply cannot put down until you know the ending.  Diane Setterfield has created several wonderfully rich characters.  I think this is the real strength of the novel.  Vida Winter a mysterious prolific writer has decided her real story must be told. She is introduced in such a mysterious way that you can't help but be excited to find out about her.  The loner and outsider Margaret Lea who is the biographer.  She also has her secrets that are slowly revealed to the reader.  Finally the mysterious and downright creepy inhabitants of Vida Winter's past. The story is at once bizarre and you feel like a street side gawker just shaking your head at the life that unfolds.  One knows that this mess will not turn out well for this family.  To me the one weakness in the novel is the length, I perhaps would have cut out a chapter or more mid-way as the story did seem a bit long.  At any rate, prepare to settle down in your favorite chair, with a cup of steaming coffee and enjoy the type of novel that will hold you in it's grip for the next several hours.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|I give it 5 Stars for the Digital Effects, minus 3 Stars for a silly, implausable, disjointed, badly conceived plot.   Add 4 Stars because someone at Paramount took a big chance on a new director and new technology.     NOTE To Mr. Conran: If your going to make Retro Films, based on Comics/`30`s Film Serials, please watch \\" Sin City \\" and all the \\" Raiders of the Lost Ark \\"  films at least 10 times before your next project.     Subtract 5 Stars because Low Energy Jude Law was a poor choice for a Macho Tough Guy Hero. Minus 8 Stars due to Gwyneth Paltrow`s incrediably annoying impersonation, hair style and all, of Kate Hepburn`s wisecracking Chick in too many better Movies to list.     Note To Ms. Paltrow: Your no New England Patrician Airhead who made a career playing Herself. Please fire your agent NOW and go back to serious drama. ( Besides, Howard Hughes is reported to be still Dead )    Where was I , oh yeah !!...plus 8 points for Angelina Jolie, for just being there, with all that Energy amidst that plastic cast !  In fact it would have been a far better Movie with Tough Gal Capt. Franky Cook as the Hero and Law as the sidekick.    Plus 2 Points because it inspired me to write this fun, lightweight Review of a not very good, lightweight movie.     Thank You.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|First off, let me say Thank you to Amazon for clarifying that the great David Attenborough is the narrator for this series. No Attenborough would have meant no purchase on my part. Simply put the most amazing documentary on life and animals and the world around us that I have ever seen. The clarity is simply breathtaking(and that was on my tv brodcast which was in 720P...the HD transfers are in 1080p!!!!).A huge tahnak you to the creators and producers for doing this for people like myself and many others who care deeply about the world around us. <br />  My one minor complaint has to do with the fact that on the HD transfers, there is absent the supplemental material that is present on the standard defintion release. There is no 110 minutes of behind the scenes footage of what took place on these excavations to these wonderous places or interviews with the people, Attenborough or anyone for that matter. The other special feature not found on either the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD transfer is Planet Earth: The Future, which is a 150 minute documentary(Shot entirely in high defintion mind you) which chronicles how the whole series was created, and how  we can continue to preserve our earth so that we may continue to have wonderous documentaries like this for our children's children. Finally, amazingly there are charging the HD customers around $25 MORE for a product that has LESS content than on the standard defintion release.  <br />    Otherwise highly reccomended presentation that is extremely addictive and immeasureably sensational from the first scene to the last. Its simply amazes me the beauty of God's creations. <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|i really though it was great. high profile documentaries like this need to be done, they get peoples attention. i didnt like how it was focused on just global warming and Co2 . that is only a small aspect of the picture. no mention of deforestation, water pollution or any of the other green house gasses like methane. Gore made no mention of the affects of the meat industry which is just as big of a problem as our cars, but that you see, is the real inconvenient truth
0743496728|5.0|I've long been a fan of Jodi Picoult, and I think Nineteen Minutes is her best work yet.  I admire how she braids a story together and keeps the tension unrelenting as each plot line is revealed.  Her characters are authentic, the story utterly, chillingly real, and the book stays with you long after the last page.  Good for you, Jodi!
B000002GYW|5.0|This is one of the Eagles best albums. All the songs are strong and for me, the problem with some of the Eagles songs is that they sound too much like all the other soft rock songs of the 70's(check out some of the songs on their first and The Long Run). This album though dosesn't have that problem with every tune being a classic. This is one of those albums that you put in and before you know it, it's over. the version I would recommend is the version in the box set where all of their albums are made to look like the original lps from when I first owned them.
B00008V5VN|5.0|My only complaint and I still give it five stars. It's not about playing fast, or even the fact that this is heavier than hell. It's the way Sleep strung the whole song together. By the end of the song, like 64 minutes, if you haven't been smoking, you'll sure as hell feel like you have. Not many bands can pull that off. Matt Pike's future, High On Fire, can certainly do it, old Sabbath without a doubt, Electric Wizard's Dopethrone. Matt Pike's vocals would have made it that much heavier, in my opinion. Still, one of the heaviest metal releases, ever. Worth the price to be in your collection of CD's heavy enough to level the earth.
B000002GVO|5.0|This is one of the Eagles two best albums(the other being Desperado) and that doesn't mean that their other albums weren't good, however, both of these albums really are great from beginning to end. Okay so the first three songs were/are played to death on the radio. This is another album that surprises me that it was a hit because it's so dark for the most part and doesn't sound like the other stuff that was being played on the radio at the time. A song like Wasted Time reminds me of an updated tourch song and not really anything like the Bay City Rollers or Tony Orlando And Dawn(big hits at the time). Originally this was going to be the last Eagles album but the record company had other ideas. This is also the first with Joe Walsh in the band and his main song on the album Pretty Maids All In A Row is the best song he's ever written. Randy should be pointed out for his tune Try And Love Again which is also the only song on here in which the band does it's country/rock thing. Once again, I would suggest going with the box set and getting the mini lp sleeve version.
B000HWZ5VU|4.0|Let's be honest up front.People expected Led Zeppelin all over again. Didn't happen,of course. What happened is Plant proved beyond a shadow of a doubt his talents as a rock vocalist. Has a Zep-style sound,though. I guess Plant picked up some habits along the way he couldn't break. Good for us! NOT a bad song on this CD.Seriously...every song is good. Although they purposely kept away from Guitar God comparisons,the guitar playing on this is extraordinary. Very unique.  <br />One of my all-time faves,of any artist. Oh,yeah...the girls usually LOVE this one. Does that count for an added half a star?! Hell,Yeah! 4 1/2 STARZ. <br />Buy this CD without hesitation. Re-mastered version is awesome.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|All I can say is WOW...They remade No Cars Go.  It even better than before. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM NOW...DON'T WAIT....DO IT....DO IT.  You will love it. <br /> <br />Peace, <br />
020161622X|4.0|I come to this book from a slightly odd perspective.  Although I have some programming experience, it is very minor, and my current job is focused on strategy and project management rather than the nuts and bolts of coding.  I bought the book hoping that it would give me a glimpse into the minds of the senior engineers I work with every day.  This it did, quite successfully.   <br /> <br />There are seventy numbered tips divided into rough categories.  The challenge for me was to distinguish those that nearly all programmers would agree with (\\"always use source control\\") from those that may represent a preference of the author (\\"design with contracts\\").  An obvious way of doing this would be to review every tip with a programmer you respected.  But if you plan to do this, try to buy the poor guy a beer afterwards.  That's a lot of tips. <br /> <br />I also found very quickly that the subtitle of the book was no joke.  These tips will help propel a programmer from \\"journeyman to master\\", but they are a stretch if, like me, you are a relative beginner.  Nothing written here is conceptually outside the grasp of anyone who has done coding outside the classroom, but many of the implications and details escaped me until I talked them over with experienced professionals.  It doesn't pretend to be a book for beginners, and by gum, it's not. <br /> <br />There is also a very heavy emphasis on testing and automation throughout the text.  While much of the time this is obviously a good idea, it is focused on a certain type of programming whose core challenges are on the back end, and not user facing.  Perhaps there is a method of testing that would catch the UI errors and usability problems that crop up so often when developing for the web, but if they were described I didn't catch them. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone working with programmers on a professional basis.  It helps to understand some of their tools and processes, although not every engineer agrees with every tip presented.  If you're learning how to program yourself though, I recommend you wait on this one till you're through a few more introductory texts.
0446691437|5.0|A friend gave this book to me one week ago. I questioned her choice because I am in the Financial Services industry, and thought that this book catered only to those in the field of art. <br /> <br />Big Mistake - and one I'm glad I made. <br /> <br />This treasure-trove of common sense applies to one and all. It's changed my thinking from a larger perspective, and I've highlited no fewer than 35 pages, all of which I plan on recopying into a separate notebook for easy reference. <br /> <br />Please do not be misled by the book's title, as I almost was. If you've ever found yourself resisting (keep that word in mind) anything that you want or need to get done, go no further. This is the place. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

1582701709|4.0|I first found out about \\"The Secret\\" on Oprah's show.  While I don't see it as an answer to all the negative things in life, it only makes sense that positive attracts positive and vice versa.  Everybody knows people who are negative thinkers & how unpleasant they can be to be around.  I do believe that learning from the bad things & pulling something positive from them can alter your life.  This book can be a guide for that.

THE BOOKS SPEAKS TO YOU, AND EVERYONE WOULD TAKE SOMETHING AWAY FROM LISTENING TO THE CD'S. IT'S THE BEST BETTER THE THE VIDEO.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This surpassed all expectations, I had watched the performance on PBS but this was truly amazing
B000F0UUT6|3.0|Enough has been written about the content. It's excellent. I previously viewed and was pleased with the transfer quality of the 4x3 release. I purchased this new set with high expectations and was very disappointed to find that the transfer to 16x9 looked like it was done from a video tape. The resolution is poor and the color looks washed out, sort of like one of those color enhanced black and white films without the cartoonish splashes of color.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The cinemotography and coreography was outstanding but nothing could overshadow the talent of these young ladies and the enjoyment they seem to have performing together.

0061148512|2.0|The other night A&E Classroom ran an excellent biography of Sylvia Plath. I was very moved by the story of this brilliant woman who died so young and so tragically. I knew of her name from long ago having grown up just down the road from Smith; however, I never read any of her work. I just read The Bell Jar. While I will never forget the tormented story of Esther Greenwood, I would not rate this as a masterpiece of fiction. Perhaps the real talent is in her poetry.

B000K4WLXA|5.0|I owned the first DVD of Advent Children and I can tell you that buying this Limited Edition is well worth the price of admission. The extras in the box are of superb quality and the english script is a great addition for those who like to put on their own \\"Fan Fiction\\" plays.<br /><br />Of course anyone reading these reviews want to know one thing... is it really worth it to pay the price just for 2 books and some pictures? well thats not the only thing you get with this set, the DVDs themselves have been remastered (or at least from what I can tell). The bonus disk in this set now has the \\"Last Order\\" anime movie that helps as a quick refresher to the story of Zack, but lack of an english language track and just having subtitles might leave a few in the cold (though if you watch anime on a regular basis you know its the only way to watch it).<br /><br />The Movie itself will go down as a technical marvel. The story a non Final Fantasy Fan might not get without some research. However a seasoned vet will have already bought this set even without reading the review. The quality of the movie is amazing, I owned the set before this and it looked like any other DVD... no better and not less. This set however I instantly noticed a more richer color and more defined areas, on my DVD player of choice it looks like an HD movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a Pixar / Shreck / Happy Feet fan, you might be in for a shock for what this movie has.<br /><br />The Graphics: Blow anything any other movie has done to this point.<br /><br />The Action: Defy the bounds of reality but at the same time is slick, smooth, and in a grand kick booty fashion.<br /><br />The Story: If you have never heard nor played Final Fantasy VII then you might need to do some research before purchasing as far as the story goes, this is a sequel meant mostly for those who played the game.<br /><br />Regional Language: Probably the only and most annoying part of the whole disk is that the English language track seems as though it is a second off from the lip movement of the characters. The English cast did a good job, just seems out of sync. You might want to go into Otaku Mode on this one (Japanese Audio with Subtitles)<br /><br />For me, it was well worth the buy and if you buy it for a fan or if you are a fan, you'll enjoy it too.that the English language track seems as though it is a second off from the lip movement of the characters.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|I am surprised at the negative comments about this movie.  I am also a great fan of the epic, BEOWULF, having read it in highschool and college. I'm a university instructor and have used BEOWULF in my classes.  (The Michael Alexander version is best).  So I was very anxious to see this version of BEOWULF and was not disappointed.  I thought perhaps the movie might have owed something to John Gardner's version of the story (GRENDEL).  Gardner's GRENDEL goes a long way toward humanizing the \\"monster,\\" but this movie goes even further, dropping the idea that Grendel was descended from Cain all together.  In fact, the movie is a perfect representation of how the world has changed since the original epic was written.  Our whole idea of heroes is different now.  Hence Beowulf is conflicted and the differences between right and wrong are blurred.  It is also refreshing to watch a movie that is filmed in a real location and not in front of a blue screen!  The setting is bleak and beautiful.  The acting is first rate.  This movie is definitely worth watching.
B000CNDIZE|3.0|Sia is hard to get attached to. Her music is slow, and not all that original. Her voice is what drew me in on the single, Sunday, but on most of her other tracks, she doesn't stretch it, and it gets kind of boring. On the whole though, once you get used to the melody (if they have one) of the songs, it becomes comforting to hear them. Almost like going home after working all day.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I'm listening to \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" as I'm typing this.  Still a great song 20 years after its release!  Anyway, if you don't have all the albums from this band (personally, I have Appetite For Destruction and Live Era '87-'93), then the Greatest Hits compilation should suffice.  Don't want to go into what's been covered by previous reviewers, but the 14 tracks on this compilation are classic GNR.  All of them have stood the test of time thus far and will continue to stand the test of time!  Now if only Axl Rose would get around to releasing Chinese Democracy...
B00005JPLU|5.0|Just a few comments:  Not everyone will like it. Technically a brilliant movie. Facinating sets and actors. Bloody battles. A little too cliched, but OK otherwise.  Definitely a movie I'd see twice - there is so much detail in the movie,  it is difficult to see and take everything in the first time.  Stunning battles scenes. Acting was not too bad.   I think a difficult theme to make a movie about. Loved certain parts of the movie. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have always loved this movie and watch it every time it is on TV.  Now I don't have to wait and can get it out whenever I want.  Not only is the quality spectacular but the details incredible.  I never knew there were buttons on the dresses the ladies wear.  The colors are amazing. <br /> <br />The other part I found wonderful was the making of on the 2nd disk.  The various things included were just remarkable.  Who would have thought to spray paint the leaves?   <br /> <br />If you even remotely liked the movie on TV get this one for your own.  You will not regret it!
B000MQ58VI|1.0|Having just seen Disney's \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" in the astounding new Disney Digital 3D process, I'm a little taken aback that The Mouse missed the chance to release \\"Chicken Little\\" in 3D.  I understand this movie had a limited run (80 screens?) as a Disney Digital 3D presentation last year.  So where's the DD3D DVD? <br /> <br />I grew up during the 3D craze of the early 1950's, and I'm here to tell you Disney Digital is the real deal.  The old red/green system never came close to producing a watchable image, even in black and white, let alone color.  With Disney Digital I saw a bright, clear, totally colorful 3-dimensional image so good I quickly forgot I was wearing the new polarizing glasses.  In terms of technical visual process, \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" is the same sort of giant leap forward we had with \\"Toy Story\\" in the '90s, \\"The Abyss\\" in the '80s, and \\"Star Wars\\" in the '70s.  I'm eagerly looking forward to \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" as a 3D Blu-ray offering later this year.  Disney has once again set a new standard in film making. <br /> <br />In the meantime, I can't wait to see what Robert Rodriguez does when he gets his grubby mits on this process.  His recent \\"Spy Kids 3D\\" and \\"Shark Boy and Lava Girl\\" were worthy 3D efforts, but they were based on the old two-color technology and were well nigh unwatchable in 3D.  Wouldn't surprise at all me to see a \\"Sin City 3D\\" (in the digital process) exploding out of cineplex screens sometime next year. <br /> <br />Before that we will have Tim Burton's \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" retooled in DD3D for this coming Hallowe'en.  Woo hoo!  The 3D trailer showing with \\"Robinsons\\" is amazing!
B000HC2LIK|5.0|I have always liked the directors cut over the theatrical release. I had it on VHS and finally picked it up on DVD.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out. Its even better in the directors cut,as there are quite a few scenes that were not in the original.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|First off, the acting is really consistent and very good <br />throughout the whole movie. The screenplay by Marber and  <br />the direction by Nichols are fantastic.. I certainly agree <br />that this is one of Nichols best in years.. <br /> <br />Initially, I didn't know who Clive Owen was.. after having watched <br />the movie for the seventh or eighth time, I have to admit that he <br />stood out.. but Jude Law's performance is also noteworthy.. he's just  <br />a spectacular actor.. both Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts deliver <br />solid performances.. this is an intense, entertaining and thought <br />provoking film about love and passion.

0618680004|5.0|When I began this book, I was agnostic, but leaning towards atheism.  The unknown and the complexity of the universe has always made me think there is a good chance that there is some higher power, although I have never believed any of the major religions have \\"the truth.\\" <br /> <br />This book was an eye-opener.  The most impactful thing for me was that our current inability to explain something is not evidence of the existance of god.  As Dawkins points out, religious leaders have for millenia tried to hide god in the gaps of human knowledge.  Whenever something can't be explained, they proclaim that science has failed and that god is the only explanation.  The problem for them is that as we learn more, god has fewer and fewer places to hide.  How much do we have to learn and how many times do we have to prove the creationists and other religious people wrong before we can accept the fact that there is no god, and more importantly that we don't need there to be a god? <br /> <br />After reading this book, I am no longer agnostic.  I am firmly in the atheist camp.  This book blows away each and every good arguement that has ever been made for the existance of god.  The thing that strikes me most is how liberating it was to give up the idea of god.  We are raised to think that type of realization would be devestating.  It isn't.  The world is a beautiful place.  If you open your eyes, you'll look at the world and see that this life offers everything you could ever need or want.  With that outlook, you can have a new appreciation for life and live life to its fullest.  I come to the realization that you have to be very selfish to look at the universe in all its glory and ask your god to give you even more.  I'm just grateful that I exist at all, however temporary my existance may be.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|after finishing the movie i felt like i wasted my money. The movie was boring and had no real plot to keep me interested through out the whole movie. i had to watch it and pause because it was boring enough that i could not watch it at one.
B000K7VHJQ|2.0|I viewed this film the other night when I had nothing better to do. The film is passable but it is too graphic, particularly the scenes depicting the scourging of Christ. <br />I think this worst than third degree torture is purely cinematic and has no relevance at all in the punitive sentence accorded to Christ Himself.  <br />Reviewing the sourging scenes in more leisure time, I think Jesus would have died than and there with such  cruel method that was used on him.  This coupled with lack of sleep, drinking water and eating, he would not be able to even walk straight up and much less carry the heavy wooden cross at all! <br />I think the picture is rather an exaggeration and too graphic to convince me  as a Christian. Well...who am I to urge the commercial techniques used by Hollywood. On the whole, the film is better than the fabrication and untruth betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ in other later films about him by Hollywood which are tantamount to insult of Christianity and a great affront to the truth of Jesus Christ - saviour of mankind.
B000BYA5GE|4.0|One of the adverts at the start of the version of this DVD which I watched was placed by a campaign against the arms trade. The advert took the form of a spoof TV advert for weapons. It's difficult to see what the people who paid for this advert thought they were adding to what is already on the disc; essentially the film itself is a much longer and more sophisticated version of the same point.    Nicolas Cage plays the central character and narrator Yuri Orlov, who was born in what is now the Ukraine and emigrated from the former Soviet Union with his parents. He becomes an international arms dealer. Obviously damaged inside by the human consequences of his trade, Orlov tries to deal with them by distancing himself from the actions of his customers and avoiding crimes other than gun-running. When a Columbian drug baron wants to pay him in cocaine rather than money, Orlov protests \\"I'm am arms trader, not a drug dealer.\\" At one point one of his customers tries to \\"reward\\" Orlov by providing on a plate the opportunity to take revenge on a rival arms dealer who had murdered Yuri Orlov's uncle. Although he had been close to his uncle and upset by that murder Orlov does not want to pull the trigger himself to kill the man responsible even under duress.    Cage is one of very few actors who could bring off the studied understatement and ironic black humour required of the central character and narrator to make this film work. You are never quite sure what exactly is going on inside Orlov's head. When he sees Gorbachov on TV announcing the end of the cold war, Yuri is so delighted that he barely hears his wife Eva (Bridget Moynahan) saying that their baby son is walking for the first time; but you are unclear whether he is so pleased because he cares about the country of his birth or because this will mean more opportunties for gun running.     Most viewers will be clear that for all Orlov's wealth they would not want to change places with him: at one point Interpol agentJack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is the nearest thing the film has to a hero says to him \\"I'd tell you to go to Hell - but I think you're already there.\\"    Strong performance from a  number of other cast members. Jared Leto is Yuri's brother and sidekick Vitaly Orlov who has even more trouble dealing with guilt about what they do; Bridget Moynahan gives a sterling performance as the trophy wife who is deeply disturbed to learn where the wealth which supports her comfortable life comes from.    Eamonn Walker gives a chilling performance as Orlov's most lucrative and dangerous customer, President Andre Baptiste of Liberia. This character appears to be based on former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is currently awaiting trial on War Crimes charges before the Hague tribunal.    Ethan Hawke plays an idealistic Interpol agent who will do almost anything, except break the law himself, to stop gun-runners like Orlov.    If you have seen the trailer for this, be warned that, like that for Cage's recent film \\"The Weather Guy\\" it shows quite a bit of black humour in the film which is laugh out loud funny out of context (e.g. in the trailer) but is not so amusing in context.     As an edgy thriller or a story of moral destruction this film works. AS a political polemic, a number of the points it makes are direct hits but it is easy to pick holes in and rather one-sided, especially at the end where the film suggests all government supplies of arms are morally equivalent to traders like Orlov.    Some government supplies of arms may be on that level, but without an arms industry and supply of weapons we would have had nothing with which to fight evils such as the Nazis. With no arms industry, those of us who have no Jewish blood would have to ask \\"How High?\\" whenever a fascist Gauleiter said \\"Jump!\\" and those who do have Jewish ancestry would not be alive.    For fans of Nicolas Cage this is possibly the best performance of his career. Worth watching if you want to seea dramatic portrait of material success and moral decline. Not a good film to watch if you want a piece of light entertainment or cheering up.
B000MRA5NS|1.0|it doesnt even deserve any stars from me. the picture quality isnt that great. you would think that a movie like this would go out and try and use a video codec. it should have been vc-1 which is far better then mpeg-4. once again horrible movie with horrible acting
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you see once by chance, then you have to see it again. There is so much more character development in this original version than you find in the 2003 remake. I recently bought both versions from Amazon, as they each have their own \\"style\\", but the original is from a time when there was no senseless violence, over-the-top graphics, or requisite vulgarity. A great bonus on the original DVD is the theatrical trailers, and documentatries on the making of the movie. <br /> <br />This is a great Sunday afternoon \\"fun\\" car movie!
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this DVD! Prince is quite a performer and this DVD brings you up close and personal with the dynamic artist. <br />LOVED IT!!! <br />I still would prefer less talk, interviews and documentary and MORE LIVE PERFORMANCES!!!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I normally don't care much for shows in the genre, but this one is the rare exception. After every episode I have watched, I am left wondering who made the decision to take it off the air and why didn't it get a bigger following
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I remember the first time I watched The Ring Cycle, one of composer Ricard Wagner's best known operas, back at 1990.  I was at once stunned and overcome by the great attention to detail and production of this epic presentation.  From the time the curtain goes up, and we are introduced to the Rhein Maidens in their glory, to the thrilling conclusion of The Twilight of the Gods, the stage is illuminated in an other-worldly glow, almost as though we have been transported to a different dimension.  I won't elaborate on the numerous plot twists.  Anyone familiar with The Ring is aware of its \\"novela\\"-esque dramatic complications (everything from incest to hari-kari is covered here).  The performances in this production are amazing!  Especially notable are Jessye Norman, Siegfried Jerusalem and Hildegaard Behrens.  Also, conductor James Levine is at his best.  Fantastic.....just keep in mind that The Ring Cycle takes many, many hours.  Pace yourself.......

B000KRNCYY|5.0|When I put this cd in my player, my usually crazy, hyper daughter (18 months) immediately quieted down and started to listen!! It has been an absolute lifesaver for us!! We go to the park everyday and she usually takes a nap on the way home, so I play it on the way home and she's usually asleep within 10 minutes of leaving the parking lot!! I love to listen to it when I'm stressed or worried about something and it's like an instant calm comes over me!!
B00005JNJV|5.0|What can I say that others haven't for me. The movie is just a stunning revivement of the once-maligned Batman franchise, which took a nose dive with the one-two punch of Joel Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" in 1995 and 1997, respectively. After B&R bombed at the box office (though it made over $100 million domestically) and the wannabe Batman revival film \\"Catwoman\\", the franchise seemed doomed to wallow in development hell. In 2003, newcomer filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who blew audiences away with his first feature film \\"Memento\\") and veteran screenwriter David S. Goyer (who penned all three scripts for the \\"Blade\\" series, which were also based on a comic book) approached Warner Brothers about doing another Batman movie, only this time taking the hero back to his roots and making it more realistic and believable. The film began production in early 2004 in London, casting Welsh actor Christian Bale as the titular hero Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth.. When the film finished principal photography, Warner Brothers decided not to pull a big ad campaign like they did for the previous four films, but decided to mute it and let the film sell itself. <br /> <br />The film opened with a good $72 million opening weekend and with ecstatic critical acclaim by critics nationwide. In a year that was filled with big blockbusters (including the highly anticipated \\"Revenge of the Sith\\"), \\"Batman Begins\\" demonstrated long legs at the box office, finally ending its theatrical run with a tidy $205 million profit domestically. <br /> <br />One of the reason \\"Batman Begins\\" did so well was the good word-of-mouth. People came back for repeat viewings (I did go and see it in theaters twice) and truth be told, it's an excellent movie to boot. It jetissons the campiness of the Schumacher entries and the excess Gothicism of the Burton entries and goes for a low-key realism. Sure, there are still minor elements in the film that recall other Batman films (the poison gas plot is redone from \\"Batman\\" and there are two villains), but they fit in with the surroundings. And it delves into Bruce Wayne's backstory via flashbacks and flash-forwarding to the present (it is non-linear, so one has to pay attention to the film right from the start) for a good bit of running time before remaining firmly entrenched in the present future. The Oscar-nominated cinematography is just stunning and while it still captures the darkness of the Burton films, it does so in a subtly different way. Every actor is well-cast, particularly Christian Bale (\\"American Psycho\\", \\"The Prestige\\") as the title character and balances Wayne's duality naturally. The movie also strikes a balance between exposition and keeping the action moving, and never loses focus. From the beginning right to the end credits, the movie is riveting and never boring. It stands well by itself, but the ending is purposefully wide-open for a sequel. (The sequel, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is currently in production and will have a July 2008 release date.) <br /> <br />The movie is available on DVD in two forms: separate single-disc full-screen and anamorphic widescreen formats and a widescreen-only 2-disc edition. It is also available in a out-of-print VHS format as well as on HD-DVD (the Blu-ray edition has yet to be released). As much as I'm a sucker for extras, I'll be reviewing the single-disc widescreen edition (which has a much better cover). <br /> <br />The film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks absolutely spectacular from start to finish. (Nolan has said that he worked with the WB to make sure the film looked and sounded as good as possible on home video.) The film has a natural, more earthy tone than the simply Gothic and gaudy looks Burton and Schumacher imparted in the previous movies, and it handles contrast with ease. Black levels are smooth and inky, and compression is very well-done. There's no unwanted grain (other than just enough to impart a more film-like presentation), and no dirt or digital artifacts. For standard defintion DVD, this is one of the WB's best-looking titles. <br /> <br />While the 2-disc Special Editions of the previous \\"Batman\\" movies all get DTS audio, \\"Batman Begins\\" is excluded from the DTS treatment. Nevertheless, the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is phenomenal. Dialogue is clear and placed in the center channel, while the surrounds are constantly in use, even in dialogue-driven scenes, where the ambience really helps draw the viewer in. But it certainly amps up the volume in the action sequences, with deep bass that'll shake the rafters and pinpoint surround activity (particularly the Tumbler chase and the climax on the monorail). Dialogue is never lost during the action sequences, and the score co-composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is always clear and detailed. A French 5.1 dub is included, and the film has optional subtitles in English, French, or Spanish. <br /> <br />As this is a single-disc release by Warner Brothers, there are mainly no extras on here save for the movie, the theatrical trailer (presented in anamorphic widescreen with stereo audio), DVD-ROM material and two skippable previews at start-up for \\"Smallville\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". The main menu and almost all of the submenus are animated (the scene selection has animated previews) and the film is divided into 40 chapters. The disc is placed in a regular Amaray case and no chapter insert is included. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie due to the hype, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out. Both editions of the film (as well as the HD-DVD) present the movie in flawless digital clarity and stunning surround sound, so you won't lose quality either way in terms of presentation. Highly recommended and can't wait for the sequel.
B000002WYT|5.0|CRASH by the Dave Matthew Band is just amazing.  I can't believe I waited so long to buy this.  How would I describe this album in one word?  STUNNING.  I mean, between the seamless percussion and sensuous vocals, this album has you at the opening bars of \\"So Much To Say\\" (track #1) and doesn't let go until \\"Proudest Monkey\\" (the final track, #12).  Dave Matthews is masterful here, as are the supporting musicians.  The soaring violin-work on track #3, \\"Crash,\\" on of their most well-known songs, is masterfully delivered by Boyd Tinsley.  Oh my God, I would marry this man and I have never even had a conversation with him....he seduces me with his violin.  This whole album is an odyssey through love, sexuality and alienated indifference.  This music is way more than compelling melodies.  The lyrics are poetry.  Dave Matthews is at once intimately alluring on \\"Crash,\\" and then emotinally unavailable on \\"Say Goodbye,\\" an ode to one night stands.  Get this album today.  Don't wait another day........buy it now.

B0007NMKB2|5.0|Explosively Fun, fast and heavy...I am so excited that the original lineup are back together and releasing new material sometime in 2007. Bug which came out in 1988, was the last album to come out by Dinosaur Jr.s' original line-up: J. Mascis - Lead Vocals and guitar, Lou Barlow - Bass - & Murph on drums.<br />Bug is the band's third and at least to me, it's also their best!<br />This one is more of a structered, and more accessible sound then their previous albums - (Dinosaur-s/t- 1985, & \\"You're Living All Over Me\\" 1987). 1988 also was the year that the band changed their name from \\"Dinosaur\\" to Dinosaur Jr. A San-Francisco band who had the same name protested, so J. and crew added Jr.<br />This was J's band from the start and there was a lot of differences and frustrated tension between the lead singer and Lou Barlow. This showed quite a bit in the band's live shows resulting in more ferocity and aggression than ever, in some ways maybe for the better. Although some live shows were said to be just plain awful. J ends up kicking L. Barlow out of the band, and Lou would form his own band - Sebadoh in 1989.<br />Opening track \\"Freak Scene\\" - become a college radio hit and a U.K. indie chart topper. Mumbled slowed down folkish vocals were J. Mascis' signature including fast \\"grungy\\" ragged riffs, and streaming fire blazing guitar solos were Dinosaur Jr.s' trademark and I do feel it is best shown on all of these 10 tracks. Also more accessible like I said before. Songs like \\"Freak Scene\\" - \\"No Bones\\" - & \\"Let It Ride\\" if came out about three years later really could have given the \\"Grunge Kings\\" like Nirvana and Pearl Jam; a real challenge for that crown. J sang w/ such a folk-melodic style with chaotically over-charged pure white noise to back up his voice. Pretty close to my definition of a heavy metal sound. He was the true king of the quiet to loud sound.<br />In a lot of Dinosaur's music J.Mascis vocal delivery sounds a lot like Neil Young, this is mainly apparent on Bug in songs: \\"Pond Song\\" & closing track \\"Keep the Glove.\\"<br />  You can really sense the aggressive tension in the ferocity all the way through, from the original trio's swan-song. Fast Forward to 2007 and they're back together hopefully settling their differences and back to play live again and make some more killer music!<br />Bug is for Rock fans of all ages, heavier than any of the \\"BIG\\" grunge names in the '90s. And another one of my FAVORITES!  Yep - 5 starsPond Song\\" & closing track \\"Keep the Glove.\\"    You can really sense the aggressive tension in the ferocity all the way through, from the original trio's swan-song.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|One of Scorcesee's best and one of the best in it's genre. An instant classic. A crime masterpiece. Ranks up there with Michael Mann's Heat as one of the best crime dramas of all time. The storyline, acting, suspense, direction, writing, and plot are all superb.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|As a child growing up in the shadow of Kennedy Space Center and with a father that helped put a man on the moon, I am especially proud of the way Hanks and HBO depicted the sacrifices made by, not just the Astronauts, but the support personnel and their families as well.  I remember well my Dad's white shirt, pocket protector and thin black tie. <br />A treasure for anyone's video library.
1881273156|5.0|Very very good.  A must for anyone who wants to live life easier.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I bought this copy of the DVD mainly for the extra content which was lacking in the first release. As many remember the violence was one of the biggest complaints about this film. This version has had much of the brutality of the scourging scenes editted out. This makes it more suitable for a family viewing; as compared to the original where I recommended that only children 17 or older see it because of its graphic nature. Now I feel a family could watch it with a 13 year old present.
B00005JPLU|4.0|I had high hopes for this film before I went to see it. The director Zak Snyder impressed me with his remake of \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\". I expected something equally bloodsoaked and on that level, I was not disappointed. This film is about a battle which took place between 300 Spartans led by Leonidas and a million Persians led by Xerxes. The start of the film shows Leonidas's initiation into the Spartan way of life, being sent off to a school as a child to be brutalised and forced to hunt a giant wolf. We are left under no illusion that the Spartan way of life is exceptionally hard. What we begin to see as Leonidas is shown as an adult is the steeliness of the character of these Spartan people and their absolute refusal to surrender or give up. The battle scenes in this movie are amazing. They are really choreographed beautifully. The scenery is also beautiful - almost completed done on a green screen using CGI special effects. Each character looks almost surreal. Every Spartan soldier has a regulation six pack (most definitely added afterwards !). Some of the Spartan adversaries look really spectacular especially the giant king Xerxes with the extremely low voice. I also enjoyed some of the monstrous creatures led into battle by the Persians by chains and set loose on the Spartan army. Of course, this film is hardly accurate historically. Some of the creatures in this film look like extras from Hellraiser or 13 Ghosts. However, for pure entertainment , this film is on a par with other Frank Miller creations like 'Sin City' and is worth a trip to the cinema or the video store to see. Mind you, if you are squeamish, stay away.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is a 2-disk set - the first one is \\"ok\\", but I have nearly worn the second out. Sexy, sassy, and soulful!<br /><br />Love Nasty Naughty Boys, and Hurt reminds me of my relationship with my father, who is now deceased.  Every song on the second CD is wonderful! I think Christina has really grown - Bravo!
0767819594|5.0|What's up with Selma Blair's retarded rag doll performance-it's disctracting and really not as funny as the producers seem to think.<br /><br />Otherwise I think this film is sleek and perfect.  I own and watch it regularly.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|War reached its ultimate state - in both grandeur and tragedy - with WWII, and Patton was perhaps the best personification of both its aspects. George C. Scott was in this movie able to capture the conflicts and limitations of modern warfare and to display the ancient traditions of the soldier in a way no one else has. The movie does an admirable job of depicting the final years of WWII from both the Allied and Axis sides of the European war. If the movie can be faulted at all, it is in its tendency to romanticize war though the personality of this great but flawed man.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is a Masterpiece Theatre production of JANE EYRE. As such, it is of the highest production quality.  The actors are brilliant and the cinematography is beautiful.  It is a 2 disc edition and the story is given it's due without unwanted editing to make it fit into one disc.

B00005JPLU|5.0|...so what?  Tremendous fun and absorbing eye-candy, nonetheless.<br /><br />I went to see this film with very low expectations, just wanted some nice mindless escapist entertainment for a change (my tastes in film usually run towards indies, art-house foreign flicks and dramas), and it delivered in spades.<br /><br />For one thing, I didn't expect to see so much yummy-exquisite female nudity, as provided by the pubescent girl (17? 18?) who plays the Oracle and by Queen Gorgos (perhaps \\"Queen Gorgeous\\" would've been a better name, mama mia!).  The battle scenes were relentlessly entertaining and at turns unintentionally funny in just how overdone and hyperbolic they were.  Could've used a bit more black humor though, the only bit of it I remember was when the Spartans were killing off the wounded Persians while engaging in droll conversation.<br /><br />Now for the Cheese-Whiz, which I could have done without:<br /><br />1.  The hopelessly pompous voice-over narration.  Ugh, the man sounded like a cross between Charleton Heston pimping for the National Rifle Association and some Fox News wingnut moron.  Even cheesier than the purple narrator of \\"Saving Private Ryan!\\"<br /><br />2.  The jingoistic/nationalistic cow droppings: parts of this script could have been lifted straight from some Homeland Security, Republican Party, or GW Bush talking points.  Especially when Queen Gorgos tells the Spartan council that \\"Freedom isn't always free\\"--- gag! cough! Sieg Heil!!!<br /><br />3.  The shameless rip-offs from \\"Gladiator:\\" Leonidas has more than a passing resemblance to Russell Crowe; Lena Headey (Queen Gorgos) is the spitting image of Connie Nielsen (the emperor's sister in \\"Gladiator\\"); and especially the sepia-toned images of lush wheat fields swaying in the wind while accompanied by Enya-like music.<br /><br />4.  Some of the dialogue was pretty bad, not just the jingoistic bits mentioned above but also any Deep Emotional Moments which simply underscored the limitations of the cast and script.<br /><br />5.  Some of the battle scenes were afflicted by speed-metal guitar riffs, which made the male-teenager-focused video-game nature of this movie way too obvious and annoying.<br /><br />But despite its flaws (many more flaws than Miller's \\"Sin City\\" btw) the sheer visual quality of this film still made it a thoroughly enjoyable experience despite the fact that yes it would make a great recruiting film for ANY military institution.  The violence was actually not anywhere as gruesome as I expected, probably because the battle scenes were so heavily computer-generated; I found the battle scenes of \\"Rob Roy\\" and \\"Braveheart\\" for example to be much more gory.<br /><br />PS.  I did a Google search for \\"history of Sparta\\" and found out many very interesting things.  Most interesting is that Sparta was indeed an oligarchical slave state and a deeply rigid and repressive totalitarian one at that, NOT the brave democracy that this film might lead you to believe, with all the GW Bush-like twaddle about \\"freedom\\" and \\"free men\\"---or is there a hidden irony in that parallel?  We Americans eat up all of our government's propaganda telling us how wonderfully free and democratic our nation is, and this is true only relative to countries like North Korea and Cuba, but beyond those extremes, when compared to say Sweden or Canada or Germany the US is really best described as a corporate plutocracy that happens to be very adept at manufacturing consent on the part of its citizens for this status quo.ttle scenes were afflicted by speed-metal guitar riffs, which made the male-teenager-focused video-game nature of this movie way too obvious and annoying.

B00008IAMD|5.0|Having grown up in the New York area, where, in the early 1970s, country was definitely not \\"cool,\\" I have taken more than thirty years to discover Johnny Cash. I am stunned by the remarkable quality of the music I have finally, belatedly, come to love. All of the American Recordings produced by Rick Rubin are fantastic, but, for me, this is the best of the lot. The title track (written by Cash) is especially memorable: it is a superb song, and is framed by Cash's eerie readings from the book of Revelations, in a world-weary voice that sounds as old as God himself. Every track here is timeless and haunting. This is a wonderful album, personal, profound, and unforgetable from start to finish. A true American classic, very highly recommended.
B000NQRE1O|5.0|Hopefully, Paramount will give us this ultimate version of the film with all of those extras they left out of the 2005 3 DVD USA release. God, I hope. Why should we have to settle for less? I want to also see a retrospective. I'll bet money that Leo won't be doing an interview. I don't think Kate will either. But, it would be nice if those two showed some appreciation for their fans.    Titanic is still one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It will be on par with Gone With The Wind, Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia for a long time to come. Also, I doubt there will be a movie within the next ten years that will knock it off the number one spot. But, who knows?    If and when this wonderful film finally comes to HD DVD, don't miss out, buy up a copy. There's nothing like experiencing this film with a big screen and with perfect picture quality.    I am confused. Many have openly admitted that the amount of money Titanic could not have been made by teenyboppers. Titanic succeeded where so many others have failed because it is that good. I wonder if those Titanic haters are jealous. I wonder if they value their one-dimensional perspectives so much, they can't see the forest through the trees. Titanic is a truly great film.     When I first heard about the newest AFI 100 greatest films list, I was counting the days to see just where Titanic would stand. They advertised this list with several pictures of several great films, including Titanic. The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Casablanca were among those films listed. Boy, did Titanic ever look appropriately placed among those equally great movies.     The film made millions - almost billions. Is that any reason to attack it? No. As far as the screenplay complaints are concerned, what makes a great screenplay? If these naysayers can write me a better screenplay to fit perfectly with each and every scene shot in Titanic, I'll start to listen to those complaints. Until then, the film works perfectly with the dialogue that it has. In some ways I can't help but wonder if everyone saw the movie and fell in love with this 3 hour long, costume drama, \\"chick flick\\" about death, and rejected it.     I bet anything, everyone who first saw the film were instantly awe-struck, and instantly inspired by it. They automatically started considering it among the greatest ever. Then they realized that the film was all the work of one man. It was his screenplay, his editing, his directing, his producing that made the film so great. It may be easy to bash a film that becomes so sucessful when it is all one man's vision. I just don't know.     I've seen my share of films. I've seen Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind and even Schindler's List enough times to really start critiquing them. Titanic is no better or worse in my opinion - just different. Titanic belonged in the top ten on their 100 greatest list. Instead, they put the film under Forrest Gump. There must be something about James Cameron's filmmaking that everyone hates. If it's not jealousy, then what is it? Everyone knows that Ridley Scott's films haven't exactly been all-together successful. Everyone knows that once great directors like De Palma need not be on that list. But when a filmmaker can put out good film after good film or in Cameron's case, great film after great film, there's always something they'll find to use against him. He's an artist. He's in the same lot as Alfred Hitchcock. They probably didn't think much of his art until the more recent years. Maybe Cameron will have to die before audiences and critics start taking his work more seriously. Ha ha! The great James Cameron is a martar now!     No. I don't want him to die. I want him to make great film after great film for many more years to come.     Titanic will most likely be remembered as his greatest achievement. And, rightly so.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|\\"The Holiday\\" is the kind of film that will stand the test of time and has the potential to be a Christmas perennial.  A real cynic could dismiss this charming flick.  How can you dislike a film that cites the moxy of Irene Dunne and the genius of Ennio Morricone?  Give director-writer Nancy Myers kudos for having the chutzpah to reference classic old movies and making one that doesn't compare unfavorably to them.  Also cite the film's top-flight cast(Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black) who give sincere performances that bely schmaltz.  Eli Wallach nearly steals the show here as an aged Hollywood screenwriter who Winslet befriends.  I initially saw this film after a ragged day of Christmas shopping with my wife.  I liked it well enough but the waterworks were going with my wife.  It's on a second viewing that the film really grew on me and convinced me of it's staying power.

0330351699|4.0|Chris McCandless was a person who could see through the lies of consumerism and society with its fake comforts. He believed in the beauty of nature, and lived by the code of something wilder than a suburbanite rich kid. He was a Thoreauiste and tried to lived to that standard.Happiest by hisself he set out to live in the bush of Alaska, being unprepared he died. The book gets a little bogged down in the middle talking about other thrill seekers and why they did what they did. I don't think Chris was a thrill seeker,maybe just disgusted with society overall.
B000O1799U|4.0|I saw this movie... and I loved it!  Jennifer Hudson, had chills running down my spine.  I did not see the original stage musical and I doubt this could top it..( I believe it won many tony awards)... but I still felt that this movie was very good.  Beyonce did a good job, but Jennifer was amazing.  She deserved the OSCAR!  I'm surprised that Eddie did not win the oscar... but you know how Hollywood is.  I can't wait until May 1 to purchase this movie.  I strongly recommend this movie.

B0001US8FI|5.0|Bruce Lee was a cult figure/phenomenon that may never be explained, a martial artist, a philosopher, a movie star. This movie I have always thought was his finest effort and showed the more thoughtful introspective side. The original scene with the shaolin,priest was cut out but it really gives you some of his thoughts on Zen and Fighting. Its great that it was put back in. I have to agree with others that in this movie Bruce was beginning to look sick and may have been slowly dying, his face was drawn and he was carrying to little body fat. The speed and power was evident and this is a great movie with a great story.
0385720920|3.0|My husband recently finished this book and told me to read it because he thought it would be something different from what I normally read. (classics, memoirs, romance, ect.) Was he ever right! I feel this book is unique yet controversial in the way that the main character's actions are not in line with the norms and morals of today's society. I found myself in shock and at times in absolute disgust as the plot unfolded in the book.  <br /> <br />The book overall was well written, but I don't think I would read it again. I think this is more geared toward the male population for a great read, my husband loved it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Watching the whole series on DVD was even better the second time around.  I loved watched it on TV, but watching these amazing episodes back-to-back is so addicting.  It is great and this is the greatest show ever.  The DVD has great bonus features, and it has great deleted scenes.  If you love LOST or want to start watching it, then you MUST buy this!
0767812166|3.0|While this movie is pleasant enough, it hardly qualifies as a \\"great\\" film.   Nevertheless, I have watched it many times since its release, and what keeps drawing me back is the music at the very end of the story.  The plot is not unique: boy meets girls, boy gets girl, boy loses girl.  The final scene has these two characters facing the inevitable separation.  The music builds to a wonderfully dissonant chord that is simply aching for resolution.  But when it resolves, it does so into another chord that equally demands resolution, so the tension remains.  But then the second chord \\"resolves\\" back into the first, and the pattern just continues, as the tension builds.    I don't think I have ever felt as powerfully, as viscerally, the force behind what it means to say that parting is a \\"sweet sorrow.\\"   And, of course, this musical theme is alluded to throughout the movie as a whole, so for anyone who knows the climax it hints at, these earlier \\"teases\\" have an almost erotic nature to them.  For me, the rest of the movie is foreplay: the scoring of the final scene creates a musical orgasm that leaves my body limp.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|arcade fire's first album took a few plays for me to get into. this one hit me on the first spin. there is a lush, dense, wall of sound throughout this whole album. no holes for silence to creep in. a real swing-for-the-fence production. and it works wonderfully. elaborate and elegant, sometimes reminiscent of prime david bowie. catchy melodies beefed up beautifully by orchestral arrangements and choral sounds. songs of fear & paranoia, claustrophobia and existential angst, sounding fresh and glorious. a great piece of musical drama. i highly recommend the thing.
080701429X|5.0|This book is a true classic in that it speaks to every generation. Even though it was written in the immediate post-Holocaust period and was one of the first personal accounts of the Nazi death camps, Frankl's brief account has new meaning today. In today's world, many people are constantly pursuing pleasure in the form of wealth, success, or sexual fulfillment. Although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these, Frankl's point is that life must have meaning. A person can inject meaning into even the most degraded life conditions by clinging to his values. But without meaning, life can drag on, seemingly without end. The \\"purpose-driven life\\" is the only life that leads to true fulfillment.
B000000W5H|4.0|This album, like \\"goats head soup,\\" suffers a bad hand of fate in the chronology of the rolling stones discography. Following closely on the heels of perhaps the greatest recording streak in rock and roll history, the 1968 to 1972 run of \\"beggars banquet,\\" \\"let it bleed,\\" and \\"exile on main street,\\"this album at first seems a bit weak. But be fair, the perfection of the `68 to `72 years could not last. If removed from the context of its proximity to those masterpieces, \\"it's only rock and roll,\\" is an outstanding album. \\"If you can't rock me,\\" \\"it's only rock `n roll,\\" and \\"dance little sister,\\" are three excellent rock numbers. \\"Time waits for no one\\" is a great, beautiful ballad. The reggae inflections juxtaposed with hard rock power chords on \\"luxury,\\" equates to a pure piece of fun, and the gritty funk of   \\"Fingerprint file,\\" is another success. Even the seemingly tossed off piece of boogie fluff, \\"short and curlies,\\" is listenable in its own slightly cheesy way. Throughout the record  keith richards and mick taylor provide fine guitar licks, and jaggers vocals are effortly expressive, whether emoting cynicism, aggression, or just plain old swagger. This is a fine and fun rock and roll record. Any band should be proud to have made such a thing. And I would highly recommend that you pick up a copy. Makes a wonderful addition to any household. <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Wonderful music. I was captivated by the quality and the voices that are so beautiful.
B000002UHG|4.0|like fellow floyd member, david gilmour, rick wright does not stray far from the pink floyd formula, and that's fine. lots of lush sounding and spacious instumental passages adorn these songs. silence is ofter lurking there at the edge of things. very listener friendly. lots of excellent percussion provided by drummer manu katche, and some fine guitar work from tim renwick and dominic miller. sinead o'connor provides outstanding vocals on two of the songs here, and mr wright himself has a pleasing soft lilt to his voice, which is effective throughout. highly recommended for those who love that pink floyd sound.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|been good times for neil young fans of late. his 2006 studio album, living with war, was excellent. then came the outstanding \\"live at the fillmore east,\\" now we have \\"massey hall 1971\\" hot on its heels. whereas the fillmore album was an electric jamfest of energetic rock and roll, massey hall is an all acoustic show, featuring neil young performing solo on acoustic guitar and piano. the sound quality is absolutely amazing. listening to it on the stereo this evening, i could close my eyes and feel that mr young was playing right there in the living room. the whole thing has a warm and intimate tone, and crystal clear sonics. the performance itself is stunning. mr young's phrasing and delivery is at a high peak of expression, sensitive to nuance and micro-tonal shiftings, making his unique voice all the more haunting. \\"journey through the past,\\"  \\"helpless,\\" \\"cowgirl in the sand,\\" \\"the needle and the damage done,\\" \\"ohio,\\" and \\"down by the river\\" are beautifully rendered, in particular. but the whole set is great, and everybody will have their own favorites here. mr young's acoustic guitar sounds spectacular, as well. anyway, i've got a life to live, so i'll stop gushing, and get back to it. just wanted to have my say. thanks.

B000NA28I4|1.0|Count me among those who have read and enjoyed the book, but seen and hated the movie.  I suppose it isn't fair to judge one by the other, but even when I think of the movie on its own merits, I still come to the conclusion that it's just a bad movie.<br /><br />Edward Speelers has star potential, and I think he gave a very good performance.  Of course, being in nearly every scene, the title character had the most time for character development.  It didn't happen well, but the actor can't be blamed for a poor screenplay.<br /><br />No other character was interesting.  Jeremy Irons (Brom) gave a wooden performance; John Malkovich (Galbatorix) was almost laughable as the villain--really, Jack Black would have been more terrifying; and Sienna Guillory (Arya) may have looked elvish, but as scripted was a thoroughly flat character.  My favorite supporting character from the book, Murtagh (played by Garrett Hedlund) has a much smaller role, and it's never really explained why he's there.<br /><br />This was the first movie by director Stefen Fangmeier.  He blew it.<br /><br />The pacing was awful.  Too much stuff was rushed (and still, so much omitted from the book) with no explanation.

B000DZIGDU|5.0|This movie blew me away. It is an excellent example of what hollywood can do when they get the right pieces in place.<br /><br />There are a few things people need to know about this movie to make sure they don't expect something that this movie does not have. This movie is based on the memoir of a man who was in the Marines during desert storm. This isn't some hollywood glorification of war and combat and saving lives in the line of fire. This is a movie about a real person who went to a real war, with a real gun. This movie is about people an what they went through. It is not about the hollywood version of war heroes.<br /><br />The movie does everything in it's power to not make a judgement on the war, or war in general. It doesn't glorify war any more than it criticizes war and vice versa. It just tell this one man's story. The movie gives you enough information to decide for yourself, or to ignore the whole thing and just appreciate a well-told story.

The ideas in The Secret focus on materialism and abundance.  It is sad to manipulate people searching for the missing link in their life with this.  You may feel better and aquire more for a while because you change your perspective on life.  In the end that void will still be left empty without God.  The author says many great people in history knew the secret and then says the secret can give you eternal youth.  Well, why are all these smart wealthy people dead just like the poor ones?

0307346609|4.0|World War Z has a few nice layers in it: it's horror, it's social satire, it's political commentary, it's science-fiction world-building. A lot of zombie-themed movies, for example, leave the viewers unsatisfied because there's just not that much you can fit into 2-hours until you get to \\"and then they all die\\" or \\"and then the last couple of people get rescued.\\" World War Z decides to evaluate many different economic and social angles that would occur in the well-explored a \\"zombie apocalypse\\" scenario. The \\"oral history\\" format allows a lot of ground to be covered without having a narrative that seems to disjointed. The creativity of this project for an otherwise over-explored genre is really impressive. I've recommended this book to a lot of friends.<br /><br />The problem is that for any good piece of science fiction, things need to be consistent and make sense. Once you've accepted that zombies are walking the earth, the rest of the story should keep you from thinking, \\"the author just pulling something out of his sleeve.\\" This happens twice-- first, Brooks posits zombies that can survive at crushing-depths until the sea. I guess he just wanted to make this scarier for the readers. Really, though, it doesn't make sense because his zombies in the book aren't otherwise any more impervious to physical damage than any humans. According to his own logic, his zombies would be crushed and destroyed deep underwater like anyone else, but he chooses to violate his own \\"rules.\\"<br /><br />Next, the part about Israel figuring out what was going on very quickly and taking extreme measures to protect themselves makes sense (basically using the same tactics to protect El-Al from hijacking and allowing in terrorists). The readers can find this plausible. What's _not_ plausible is that suddenly Israel would become hyper-benevolent and allow all its Arab/Palestinian refugees and their descendants free entry into and protection within the country. One of the things that makes zombie fiction so appealing is that it exposes and explores human flaws and self-interests under a crisis in which it's clearly not the best situation for the characters to express them. Maybe he could have made this scenario a bit more believable with a little more explication, but it wasn't ehre. Both these scenarios caused me to come out of the narrative and start critiquing the author, even though overall, it's a great book.zombie fiction so appealing is that it exposes and explores human flaws and self-interests under a crisis in which it's clearly not the best situation for the characters to express them.

B000003CMB|5.0|A spectacular collection of live jamming from the Brothers.  IMHO Duane is the greatest lead guitar player ever.  Hendrix was a spectacular virtuoso who could do things that no other player could. Clapton and the other contenders, tremendous technically, but Duane was in a league of his own in being able to communicate with his axe.  To hear lead guitar at its best, go no further than this magnificent set!    The only issue I have w/ their live stuff is that they don't know how to end a song.  Just when you think a song is about to end there's another section coming up, but that one won't be the end either.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Jacob, doing humanitarian work at an Indian children's refuge, (the erstwhile \\"Casino Royale\\" villain, Mads Mikkelsen) doesn't know what to think when his superior tells him that a prospective benefactor ( Rolf Lassgard in a heart wrenching performance as Jorgen) requires Jacob to return, after twenty years, to Denmark so that the refuge can receive a huge donation. So as much as Jacob dislikes the idea, and at this point we know not why, he returns to Denmark in Susanne Bier's remarkable, emotionally charged, sometimes even overwrought \\"After the Wedding.\\"<br />Bier has composed this film in much the same way as a Verismo opera: scenes of confrontation, scenes of enlightenment, scenes of disclosure are piled one on top of the other as the film slithers insinuatingly towards its tragic yet redemptive denouement.<br />All of the main characters: Jacob, Jorgen, Jorgen's wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen in a mature, sexy performance) and Helene and Jorgen's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christiansen: young, fresh, committed) are transformed, turned around and pointed in another direction psychically and physically by film's end due to the catastrophic upheavals that they endure during the course of this amazing film. Bier is dealing with Melodrama here, with a capital \\"M.\\" Melodrama done up right: not as a joke but as serious and humane as the Master's of this genre: Almodovar and Douglas Sirk (\\"Written on the Wind\\") to name a couple.<br />Mikkelsen's Jacob, due in a large part to Mikkelsen's hang-dog, stoic physical appearance, is an empty vessel at the beginning of this film. His work at the refuge is fulfilling and good yet you can't help feeling that Jacob is hiding from life rather than contributing to it and that his reluctance to venture back home to Denmark is his way of primarily keeping his past at arm's length. By the end, Jacob is transformed, filled up, overflowing by way of the redemptive powers of confession and acceptance: he's been opened, upended, turned inside out.<br />Don't come to Bier's world of \\"After the Wedding\\" expecting to be lulled into anything resembling a calm, quiet mood...you will genuinely be unsettled. Do come to \\"After the Wedding,\\" in many ways similar to \\"The Celebration,\\" expecting to squirm in your seat, to have your guts wrenched with the terrific bravura acting of this ensemble of actors, to cry your eyes out at scenes of transcendental beauty and truth. This film will challenge you not to react and therefore in one way or another you will react due in large part to Bier's compassionate mise en scene. A mise en scene rife with humanity and love.out.

B000NA28IE|4.0|Having seen this movie without reading the book, my perception of the movie is enjoyable.  I thought it was a really fun movie and am strongly considering purchasing.  However, I do agree with most reviews about how there needed to be more character and plot development.  Now I need to go read the book to find out what REALLY happens.

This is no \\"Burn My Eyes\\", in fact, the last album was way better.  If you love the whiny, tempo-killing singing, poorly placed solos, overly long acoustic intros, and the songs about Rob's feelings, which have been the ruin of Machine Head in the last few albums, buy this album.  If you were expecting a return to their thrash roots as the Nu-metal fans above suggest, look elsewhere.  You will be sorely disappointed as I was.  Most overhyped album of the year?  Indeed.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is funny and odd, but it has a lot of heart to it.  The writing is so good that my friends and I thought at first that it must be adapted from a larger work, such as a book.  The characters are that well crafted and the story that unique.  These are not things most comedies bother with at present.  Now, I'm calling this a comedy, but it will pull on your emotions a bit.  Its all worth it though.  The acting is great, which is not unexpected given the cast.  If you love movies and are looking for something kind of different and original this is a good way to go.  A really fun film to watch.
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|The movie itself is beautifully filmed. The acting is quite good and as a history freak I found it interesting to hear Latin and Aramaic. I did not find it anti-semitic, but then I can understand why Jewish folk might be suspicious, given the beliefs espoused by Gibsons' family, and never actually disavowed by Gibson himself.  <br />I am not a Christian, so it struck me as odd that Christians would like this film from a theological standpoint. Perhaps I am just not getting it. I always understood that the most central point of the Jesus story was that he arose from the dead, not that he was tortured to death. So it suprises me that the film would concentrate almost entirely on this one aspect of the story, rather than on the resurrection part. That it does not, smacks of violence-as-a-marketing-tool to me. When all the hoopla has died down, it will be interesting to see how much money Gibson will have made off of the suffering of his savior. <br /> <br />I have to say that I am more than a little shocked at the fawning tone I have seen in these reviews, particularly from Christians. The enthusiastic way in which they are taking joy in watching someone being slowly tortured to death is sickening; and exactly the same sort of bloodthirsty eagerness that the ancient Romans displayed when they watched animals and people (including Christians) being executed in the arena. The fact that there is a religious purpose to the film does not excuse this. I wonder if this movie were made with the exact same types of scenes, but without the religious content, how many of reviewers would still sing its praises. I guess Jesus' message has not really changed the human heart, eh? Shame on all of you. <br /> <br />If you don't think about the movie's religious implcations and view it as a horror flick in period costume, the movie comes off just fine. However I suspect that this was not Gibson's intent. <br /> <br />Not being a slasher movie fan, I probably won't see this movie again.Or even bother renting it, much less buying it. But if you are a modern day Savonarola, and believe that pain and suffering is the most important aspect of your religion, you will get off on this film.
0380804557|5.0|I put off reading any of Neil Gaiman's books for very long time.  I'm not really sure why, I guess because they were popular.  This isn't really a good reason not to read a book, especially if you love fairy tales and clever prose and that is what this book is.  By fairy tale I mean more then it deals with magic, it is written like a fairy tale with straight forward writing that covers much deeper meanings.  Story is great and the characters and interesting, I particularly like the dead brothers.  This is a fun, light hearted book, that will make you feel good about live and everything.  It may make you want to find a fallen star yourself . . . I wonder if there are male stars?
0143038419|1.0|This book was a birthday gift. After reading the opening it was completely clear that Ms Gilbert and I share the same spiritual teacher. I couldn't wait to get started.     Not being a reader of travel books, I was only really interested in the India part, but started at the beginning anyway and was pleasantly surprised. It was like being on a psychic road trip with an old friend. We were laughing and sharing stories and just having a good old time.     Then halfway down page 48 this line brought me up short. \\"...inability to even get upset that Republicans had just stolen a presidential election...\\" It felt like my traveling buddy had just poisoned my bottled water. I slapped the book shut and put it in the trash.    I puzzled over why she would interject politics into an otherwise fairly entertaining book, in a time of great polarization.     After I calmed down, I dug it out of the trash and flipped to the India part - the ashram part -  and very soon bam! she slammed me again with this line. \\"I have met others who would rather not talk about their religious affliation at all, for which, in this contentious world, you can hardly blame them.\\"     Still smarting from the \\"stolen election\\" thing, it made me think that she doesn't see herself to be part of the reason it's a contentious world.     One thing I'm learning from my spiritual path is not to make assumptions about people. Republicans are people, too. And we read books. And we are often spiritual.     Do a lexus search or google it, Ms Gilbert, and you'll find that after the election the papers from the NYTimes all the way over to the left coast, went down to Florida and counted those hanging chads two or three times. What they found and reported, one time on the back pages, was that the election was fair. Close but fair.     As for the nonsense about Gore winning because of the popular vote...we have an electoral college system. Those were the rules in place at that time. Those rules are still in place.I might still read the rest of the India part. Not sure yet.
B00081MUY0|5.0|Well, here's a blast from the past... I've owned the original album for many years (since it came out in 1966, in fact), so was intrigued with the opportunity to pick up a sonically cleaned-up version with no fewer than seven bonus tracks.  I still think it's a great work. 'Season of the Witch' is one of the 60s' defining tracks, 'Sunshine Superman' still holds its own as a pop track, and all the rest continue to shine as an ensemble showing the way toward myth-, lore-, and jazz-influenced pop.  This was actually quite a creative album, mostly recorded in late 1965 and early 1966 just before similar explorations by the Beatles and others.  I've always been a Donovan fan, and this is arguably his best album (and also his most commercially successful, I think). One of the least noticed things about Donovan's music from this period is how he integrated a blues and jazz sound into many of his compositions--this is more evident on \\"Mellow Yellow\\", the next issue, but even here one can strongly feel those influences having been absorbed on 'The Trip,' 'Bert's Blues' and 'Three Kingfishers.'
B000LAZDQA|1.0|After reading the description and reviews of this movie I was really looking forward to seeing it.  It sounded thought-provoking, intelligent and provocative.  Unfortunately after the first few minutes the actors began to speak.  The acting was fine, but the dialogue was ridiculous and by the end I didn't care about any of the characters.  As another review said, this one is definitely a movie to watch with the fast forward button.  Very disappointing.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|I first found out about Corinne Bailey Rae last year when she was spotlighted as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist. While I jumped onto her bandwagon immediately afterwards, somehow I never got around to listening to her full-length self-titled album until just recently. But I'm sure glad I did.<br /><br />By now, I'm sure everyone's familiar with the singles \\"Put Your Records On\\", \\"Like a Star\\" and \\"I'd Like to\\", but there are even more great songs to be found. \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" is a funky change from her usual fare, and \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Breathless\\" are beautiful in their own right. And although I'm not sure what \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" means, it's also a highlight.<br /><br />In fact, every song on here is a highlight. I know it's been said a few time before, but when it comes to Corinne Bailey Rae, do what her debut single instructs and put her records on.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Oh my gosh I can't believe what a wonderful show this is.  I never saw the West Wing when it was televised on NBC and it didn't look that appealing.  However, after hearing enough good things about it and being curious I picked up the first disc of season 1 at Blockbuster.  I was hooked.  My mother-in-law (God bless her!) Bought me the complete series for Christmas.  I think I watched all 7 years worth in 2 months.  What a great show.  It's true that when season 4 started you could tell that some of the original writers had left and it wasn't quite as good (but still definitely worth the watch) and shockingly Rob Lowe did an excellent job and you definitely noticed his absence after season 3.  What else can I say?  The box is neat and the book is fun but basically I got this to see the shows.  Again - it's a wonderful series and I'm really glad that I own it - I'll definitely be watching it again with my children when they're old enough.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Being a big fan of Incubus, I went to check out their latest album Light Grenades. This album seems to have garnered mixed reviews, but I think it's pretty good.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of A Crow Left of the Murder because I think it had too much filler; fortunately, that's not the case here. While the album does start off okay with \\"Quicksand\\" and \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off\\", things easily pick up with the energetic \\"Dig\\", as well as \\"Oil and Water\\" and \\"Love Hurts\\". \\"Anna-Molly\\" (pronounced like \\"anomaly\\") is also pretty decent.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why \\"Earth to Bella\\" is in the form of two separate songs, especially since both parts are barely over two minutes long, thus it would have been easy to just combine them. And the speed metal title track doesn't really go anywhere. But everything else makes Light Grenades an album worth picking up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0060930349|3.0|This history is a very readable and interesting one, however, there are a few problems.  First, the history truly is of \\"American People\\", but only a select set.  On some pages it throws out 20 names, few of which all but the more careful students will be able to remember.  The book retraces important people over events, which makes it at times hard to follow. <br /> <br />Although I would peg myself as a conservative, and while this book admits to being an optimistic history, it goes too far in some respects.  Though I loathe the apologistic, revisionist history of someone like Zinn, this book makes some unforgiveable omissions. <br /> <br />As examples, while slavery is labelled the abomination it was, the book really gives no insight into the lives of the enslaved.  And while it at times goes into great details about some slave owners who treated their slaves especially well, it does not contrast that with \\"as opposed to what\\". <br /> <br />The book also completely ignores events such as Boss Tweed, Tammany Hall and Teapot Dome.   <br /> <br />While there is a detailed account of America's first railways, there is literally NO mention of the Chinese labor that built them. <br /> <br />I stopped reading at about page 800.  Up until about 1910, the book is reasonably well balanced in terms of Republican vs Democrats.  From that point forward, however, all Democrats are malicious idiots and all Republicans are angelic saviours.  Curiously at the same point the book takes this sharp turn you start to find grammatical errors and typos.  If I were to make up a conspiracy, its almost as though the editor refused to continue once Johnson takes this stance. <br /> <br />Had Johnson opted to temper his bias in the 20th century section and to address the darker events in American history, this would have been a truly great work.

B00006EXDM|5.0|As a child of the 1960's (born in 1946), The Rolling Stones have made music that I have listened to at each stage of my adolescent and presumably post-adolescent life.  At each juncture, their music has been through changes as has one or two of the band members, as have I! Asked when he planned to retire some years ago, Mick Jagger - in classic Mick Jagger style - responded something like, \\"... no one asks Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker that question.  Why are you asking me?  I sing my version of the blues and plan to do so until I can't.  That might include being wheeled out on stage in a wheelchair some years from now, still doing what I do as best as I can.\\" That is not intended to be a direct quote, but is rather the way I recall hearing the story told and retold over the years.  I recall it this way because it makes sense to me ... a LOT of sense.  Often characterized as the quintessenal rock and toll band, The Rolling Stones were, are and I expect will continue to be and become a continuing phenomenon of musical expression. That being said, even bands that seem to go on forever have their stronger and weaker periods; their peaks of high creativity and valleys of times when they simply have to fulfill a contractual obligation by releasing an album and/or touring.<br /><br />For most Stones fans, the period the collection at hand provides an unarguably thrilling sampling of is that in the years from 1964 to 1971 during which the Stones wrote, performed and recorded some of the greatest music in the continually developing story of the genre we call Rock and Roll.<br /><br />This is a two CD set is produced on two layers. One is a `normal' CD, the second is a Super Audio CD (SACD).  Both layers have been produced from the original takes using DSD (Direct Stream Digital) encoding which does a simply tremendous job of capturing each and every subtle moment, tone and innuendo on each track - be it from voice or instrument.  It actually sounds a lot better than the original recordings and is far superior to standard `remasterings' of older studio and/or live recordings. So, even though there are no real surprises on these CDs, there is much delight to be had by the Stones audiophile in hearing just how good they really sound(ed) during this period.<br /><br />The specific tracks are all known, verbatim, to many of my generation and include, on the first CD:<br /><br />1. Time Is On My Side<br /><br />2. Heart Of Stone<br /><br />3. Play With Fire<br /><br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction<br /><br />5. As Tears Go By<br /><br />6. Get Off Of My Cloud<br /><br />7. Mother's Little Helper<br /><br />8. 19th Nervous Breakdown<br /><br />9. Paint It, Black<br /><br />10. Under My Thumb<br /><br />11. Ruby Tuesday, and<br /><br />12. Let's Spend The Night Together<br /><br />The second CD picks up where the first one leaves off with:<br /><br />1. Jumpin' Jack Flash<br /><br />2. Street Fighting Man<br /><br />3.

B00006AVRK|5.0|If you can speak English (and NO, American is NOT English) you'll enjoy this collection. Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie are a great team.  If you only know Hugh as House, it's a sort of start to see him.  Fry is like a \\"Mary Poppins\\" as that he always saves the day.....at the end. It's a lot of fun to watch Wooster get himself into fixes, and wonder how Jeeves will pull him out...........great fun, but it is English, it may be a bit of a job to understand if you only speak American.  It's a fun show, and i've very much enjoyed the whole series.
B000MV9026|2.0|As someone who typically likes animated films, I was entirely disappointed with this one. A few of my disappointments: <br /> <br />Sexed up dialogue: a good portion of the first 30 minutes is not something I would want any kid to see. Penguin sex on March of the Penguins was fine -- it was nature. This is just inappropriate since it is not about nature but about penguins trying to get in other penguins pants with dialogue. <br /> <br />Reinforcing prejudices: it may be all fun and games in the movies, but when characters are given accents and act according to prejudices corresponding to those accents, that's too much for a family film. At least, I would hope. <br /> <br />Political motivations prominent: it is true that there is an enormous problem with humans destroying ecosystems, including around the Antarctic, however, a movie should still carry a plot that isn't so blatantly political. Fire these writers for a lack of creativity of bringing in these important topics and a good movie instead of having a penguin telling the people in the movie to stop taking their fish for the last 20 minutes of the film. (I'm certainly an environmentalist and I was entirely disappointed since this film could have been good and still carried this message, meaning adults could have enjoyed seeing it a couple times and perhaps gotten something more from it.) <br /> <br />My girlfriend who was more interested in the film initially since she likes penguins also got bored after 30 minutes -- even if penguins are cute and look quite cuddly, there must be something of interest to engage the audience for 1 hour 40 minutes. This movie could have been much better. <br /> <br />The good? The computer-animated people were amazingly real -- far better than any film I had seen before. Not much else to report in this category. Some humor here and there, but some/much of it based on prejudices. <br /> <br />Seriously, skip this one. Since I would still like people to get the environmental awareness, I would recommend [[ASIN:B000ICL3KG An Inconvenient Truth]] instead -- it is a far better film, carrying an even more important overall message about a major global conservation issue. Otherwise, if penguins are your thing, watching [[ASIN:B000BI5KV0 March of the Penguins]] for the 15th time is magnitudes better than watching Happy Feet for the first time.
0920668372|1.0|I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book \\"SCARY!\\"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Once again, Stevie Nicks enchants with this amazing cd/dvd set. Devoted fans will find the cd to be a re-hash of many previously released songs, however, two new songs are included, Stevie's version of Led Zepplin's \\"Rock And Roll,\\" and an outstanding version of \\"Landslide\\". The three part harmonies on \\"Landslide\\" are incredibly beautiful and worth the purchase alone . . . and then there's the dvd.  <br /> <br />The dvd contains videos spanning Stevie's career from BellaDonna's \\"Stop Draggin My Heart Around,\\" to Trouble in Shangri La's \\"Sorcerer\\". Die hards will love that we finally get to see the Scarlett version of the Stand Back video. After completing this video, Stevie didn't like it and another version was shot and this second version was what aired on MTV.  <br /> <br />The dvd includes commentaries on each of the videos explaining what the song is about, how the video was made, etc., and Stevie even pokes quite a bit of light-hearted fun at herself. At times it's laugh-out-loud funny, and it's really interesting to hear her take on things! The videos can be watched with or without the Stevies comments.  <br /> <br />Last, but not least, the dvd includes some behind the scenes footage during the recording of Stevie's first solo album, BellaDonna. It's really cool to see Stevie, Jimmy Iovine and the girls in the studio belting it out!  <br /> <br />This cd/dvd set deserves five stars for new and old Stevie fans alike!!!! <br />
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist is a story of love, passion, murder, betrayal, magic, illusion, and the power of the human spirit. It is the story of the power that true love can hold. It is the story of magic and the wonder that it can bring. It is about recognizing the power that passion holds.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was beautiful. The storyline was wonderful, the magic was breathtaking even on film, and the film itself was just gorgeous. The Illusionist is a classic tale of love and magic with a Hitchcock-esque twist. The acting is superb all around. Edward Norton and Jessica Biel give absolutely amazing performances as do the rest of the actors. Paul Giamatti, the star of last year's Lady in the Water gives another great performance and as much as I hated Rufus Sewell's character, the prince, he gave a damn good performance to bring that hatred out.<br /><br />Neil Burger is a fairly new director and I very much look forward to his career. This movie was shot beautifully. So many warm, almost sepia tones to this film. Plenty of greens, golds, browns, and reds. Every scene was shot with so much care in mind. The film was as much a piece of art as it was a movie, a theme recurrent in the movie. Eisenheim's magic was as much art as it was illusion.<br /><br />I'm shocked that this movie wasn't up for any awards at this year's Oscars. In my opinion, it was just as good as Pan's Labyrinth which was up for I believe 5 awards. I'll go ahead and give in an award for making it into my list of top films!<br /><br />Beautiful movie that I highly recommend to anyone. Absolutely amazing.
B00005JPCF|1.0|After waiting months in anticipation of watching adorable little penquins in an animated movie......I was dumbfounded after say 15 minutes into the not so movie. The adorable penquin billed up to us throughout the months is disowned by family, friends and the community all because he can't sing but can only dance!! My first reply outloud was, this is a childs movie? To do the same thing that is done to poor innocent disabiled children or a child that is not perfect in the eyes of others or cool enough. Than all that singing, it was awful, and such a mix, sexual, rock, 70's, 50's even. Childen associated with this? Boring as hell. My husband and I just looked at each other with the look of whats going on? The movie went from cute and cuddly to the spike channel. Than on to aliens? Even the dancing in it was not suitable for children. I was disgusted by the whole thing. I immediately put the dvd in my garage sale with my own warning on it of \\"Beware, movie is not a movie, your child will not like this, you will not like this, oh what the hell just throw it away\\"! Academy award for the worst movie it should of gotten, someone bought their way to that one.
B000I5X81K|5.0|The one and only complaint I have about Josh Groban is that he is so unbelievably brilliant in concert (something which I was ignorantly unconvinced of until last night), unless you have a concert-hall-worthy sound system at home, listening to his music on cd is slightly disappointing. I have always enjoyed his music and have all of his cds, but now I know that nothing on earth compares to \\"the voice\\" live and in person. He puts on an incredible show and the seats are worth 10 times what they sell for!
B00005JPG1|5.0|This film definitely exceeded my expectations. Fincher was quite effective at staying \\"true\\" to the era he was portraying, yet still was able to demonstrate his directing prowess.  Realizing that the events depicted in the film are factual (case report based) further enhanced the tension and ambience.  The casting was impeccable, but of course Fincher's movies are consistently saturated with talented actors.  Recommended for those who may not be as familiar with the Zodiac killings and in search of a solid mystery/thriller rather than a slasher flick or story which mirrors \\"Se7en\\".
0743496728|5.0|Only Jodi Picoult can take the murderer of ten people and expose him as a person worthy of love and even pity. Picoult's newest book is heart-wrenching and impossible to put down. It's as disturbing and thought-provoking as My Sister's Keeper and every bit as important to moral debate. This is a book for society, of society. It is a wake up call for empathy in the place of cruelty. No one should miss reading this novel.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|If you can endure the foul language and constant talking about sex at the beginning, the movie is good. At the end of the movie I was rolling on the floor with laughter. Why Arkin got an Oscar for this I don't know. I've dealt with people in situations like he was supposedly representing, and they control themselves much better than him. I call it bad/poor acting. The part could have been played better by most anyone. This could have been a really great movie if handled properly.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|78 minutes of power and pleasure, that's what this is.  Not a weak track on here.  All 7 of Stevie's major solo hits are included, and they sound fabulous!  Then there are 3 solo songs that I was not familiar with:  \\"Sorceror\\", \\"Rooms On Fire\\" and \\"Planets Of The Universe\\". All 3 are good, strong tracks, especially \\"Sorceror\\", which opens with a line that I can frequently relate to:  \\"I'm tired, I'm thirsty, I'm wild-eyed in my misery...\\"  For a little more variety, we have live versions of \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Landslide\\".  \\"Rhiannon\\" packs quite a punch once the intro is done, and the orchestra gives \\"Landslide\\" an added dimension, making a song that was already beautiful even more so.  And I'm glad to have the studio version of \\"Silver Springs\\", because I had never heard it before.  Getting into some really different territory, there is the Deep Dish version of \\"Dreams\\", which is faster and harder than the original.  And I absolutely never imagined that I would ever hear Stevie Nicks burn up the place with Led Zep's \\"Rock And Roll\\", but here it is.<br /><br />Now - why 2 versions of \\"Edge Of 17\\"?  Well, the studio version obviously is the one most people would want, so it is right up front.  But by ending the album with the same track, we complete the circle, which, in Stevie's mystical world, just might be a cosmic necessity.  (The End is just The Beginning, right?)  Also, this album needs a very muscular finish, and with Stevie, the backup singers, the rock musicians and the orchestra having a field day at the end with additional lyrics and instrumental passages, the finale is quite a musical catharsis.  Whew!  I'll say it again: 78 minutes of power and pleasure!
0714843377|4.0|It's not really a book... it's a collcetion of words on thick paper. It'll take you one hour to plow through it! <br /> <br />That being said.. it is great for inspiration. I read it before I was writing a huge paper on semiotics (nay!) and I wan't happy with the outcome of the paper. The book gave me great comfort with it's fun and different look upon \\"failure\\"!! <br /> <br />I liked the story about Victoria Beckham as well. And the format!
B000H5U832|5.0|This was an excellent animated feature film. The soundtrack was <br />extraordinary & our 7 Year old grandaughter was humming the tune long after the film had ended.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is good, not great. I like how all the stories intertwine with each other... although I think the story about the japanese girl gets too long and boring in the end.  <br /> <br />Watch this movie if; <br />- you're interested in weapon control <br />- you would like to see how the US treats immigrants  <br />- you're sick of the US trying to be the global police (then this movie will make you mad!) <br />- you'd like to see \\"actors\\" in their natural environment. Amazing! <br /> <br />Do not buy this movie if it is for Brad Pitt. This is not a movie for people without any substance which world's only revolves around who's hot or not...
B000M341QE|5.0|The Departed is a powerful film with extraordinary performances by everyone involved.  DiCaprio deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Costigan, a tormented young man barely surviving the double life he leads.  Matt Damon also shines.  I don't want to write everything that happened in this movie, I invite you to find that out for yourself.  Just know that you will not be disappointed.  Hands down the best movie of 2006!
B00005JPGO|3.0|As important as the topic is, I would like to see the topic getting handled in an important and serious way as well. That means without the ladydrama, more facts, more implications for everyone involved.  <br /> <br />It's entertaining.. but I expected more. Everyone in the movie does well though.
B000M4RG42|5.0|A movie that is most needed in this age. We used to be a country that VERY patriotic but today that is missing. This movie can make that patriotism well up in everyone.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Amazing movie! <br /> <br />I'm not too fond of Penelop Cruz but she is amazing in this movie! So many serious topics rolled into one movie, so dark yet colorful.  <br /> <br />I collect spanish and south-american movies and this one is one of my favorites.
B00003CWLF|5.0|This was a pleasure-packed film from the opening scenery to the text at the end chronicling the changes brought about in Siam owing to the influence of Anna. The country and the people(at least those of the royal household) are absolutely beautiful. The king is one to whom it would be very easy to feel loyalty to.  <br />After seeing the movie, I feel compelled to read the history of Siam, and thus, Thailand.
0743496728|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is Jodi Picoult's best of the best!! I love all of Jodi's <br />books but this is my new favorite! I could not put it down! I can't wait <br />for her next book.
B00069YDXU|3.0|Somebody dropped the ball here.  Yes, although ELP in 1997 was way beyond their prime and they didn't have the energy (or even the pride) they use to have many years ago back in their heyday, but it still doesn't justify why they should sell this DVD with a reduced picture and sound quality.  But, I was willing to accept this DVD after I saw it on High Definition cable TV.<br /><br />Yes that's right!  This show was filmed with High Definition equipment and was in Widescreen on cable TV.  But this DVD is not presented in the High Definition that it should be.  And this DVD is Full Screen, not Widescreen.  The sides were cut off.  Even in the rolling credits, it tells you (in horrid blurry hardly decipherable print) that this concert was filmed in High Definition.<br /><br />I saw them live back in 1992 in Sacramento and that particular world tour has been captured on film in England and is available as the DVD of \\"Live at The Royal Albert Hall.\\"  At least, at that show, they still seemed to care about working together and giving their audience their best effort.  And strangely enough, this concert looks better on DVD than \\"Live at Montreaux.\\"  It's not High Definition, but just looks and sounds better.  They looked a little healthier too at the Royal Albert Hall.<br /><br />The only thing I have to say \\"positive\\" about their \\"Live at Montreaux\\"  DVD, is that some of their instrumental work is still pretty good.  The show starts off very typical of any ELP show over the many years they've performed together.  It's no surprise that an aging comeback band like ELP will start off their show with Karn Evil 9 (\\"Welcome Back My Friends....\\"), and about the first 20 minutes of this show could easily bore you and make you want to shut it off, but as you get deeper into the show, it does get a little better.  They get more instrumental, and that is usually what we ELP fans enjoyed the most about ELP live.  It's not Greg Lake's fault, but it is unfortunate that the first thing that diminishes in appeal about any aging rock band, is that the vocalist suffers the most obvious of the inability to continue to perform.  Keith and Carl can still entertain their audience with their instrumental solo performance, but you can tell that it's very exhaustive for them.  On this DVD, Keith's \\"Creole Dance\\" was quite good.  And the encore performance of \\"Fanfare For the Common Man\\" was an excellent display of Keith and Carl giving their best.  I didn't forget about Greg, It's just that nothing really stands out for him on this show.  \\"From the Beginning\\" is always good, so is \\"Lucky Man\\", but I wish he would have done \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\", \\"C'est La Vie\\", \\"The Old Castle\\", and maybe even \\"Epitaph\\".  All his input here was very short term and nothing outstanding.  He didn't even bother to smile for his audience.<br /><br />If they ever decide to re-release this DVD in the true High Definition Widescreen that it should have been, then maybe I'll buy it.  But, this DVD is a disaster at all levels.  I'll have to pass.<br /><br />(ATTENTION: PROG FANS: Check out the new DVD of \\"Yes: Live at Montreaux.\\"  It is the best Yes live DVD available to this day.)al about any aging rock band, is that the vocalist suffers the most obvious of the inability to continue to perform.

B000J3EEBY|3.0|I have loved Loreena's music as long as I have known it and that has got to be around sixteen or seventeen years now. In fact when I bought Elemental I think that was the only thing of hers you could find. Every other album of hers I would give a perfect FIVE STARS. However this album seems forced to me, somehow she is just not in it the way she was immersed in the other albums. I would still cut off an arm or other bits of anatomy for a chance to meet her or hear her play in concert.     Note: on this album I am particularly fond of track number 8.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie is painfully informative about the latest resource to garner war, murder, pain and suffering among african people...diamonds...the movie makes note that the largest consumer of diamonds is the U.S., inwhich diamonds trade hands from other third world nations, to its refinement and then purchase. Also, the movie informs us that diamond companies are trying to trace origins through the kemberly process, but makes note that diamonds are still smuggled and orgins remain unknown.  <br />  The most profound movie making is the visual recruitment of child soldiers, related to the indoctrination, brainwashing, and drugging (the director's commentary explains that african civilians today have not forgiven these children for their acts of murder, regardless of their brainwashing).   <br />  Djimon Hounsou, gave one of his best performances (deserved the Academy Award in my opinion), as the father whose son is stolen for war and finds the potential rarest diamond in the world, which he uses to find his son and reunite with his lost family. Two stunning scenes: Djimon's character escapes from a place where people are forced and killed to mine diamonds, never seeing the finished product, to peer into a London jewelry shop window for the first time to see the finished product on sale and when his son is about to shot him and he reminds his son who he is, his origin, family roots and the love for his family! Stunning!! This movie will cause you to think about diamonds in a different light. I will guarantee that you will ask about the origins of your next diamond purchase! <br />
B000O1799U|5.0|I will not argue with the previous reviewer that the movie is a bit over hyped, as the story itself is not that engaging. However, this movie is a favorite of mine because of the musical performance and costume aspects. Jennifer Hudson steals the show! I believe Beyonce does a great job of capturing the essence of Diana Ross. This is a great movie to sing along to!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|*siiiiiiiiiiiigh*   <br />Remember back when albums were a sonically satisfying masterpiece of music and clever wordplay, generally tied together with some overall unifying theme and message?  When the music really meant something and 'spoke' to you, even when you weren't engulfed in a purplish haze? No?  That's probably because they stopped making music like that somewhere between the Moody Blues' epic \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and when whatever marketing genius signed Paris Hilton's record deal.  They just stopped.  That reason and the fact that if you've ever even heard of the band Sigur Rós and you're from the wrong side of the Atlantic, then it was probably by accident or because you were visited and blessed by some sort of musical angel set out to save the world from even still more Nirvana rip-off bands and flash-in-the-pan American I-dulls.  In either of those cases, you owe it to yourself and humanity, now that you've happened upon the band and this, their magnum opus,  to listen to \\"Takk...\\" a good thirty of forty times or until you start humming to yourself in Icelandic.   <br /> <br />The band, Sigur Rós, is from the fairy-tale kingdom of Iceland, where genetically engineered-to-be-beautiful little Bjork-ettes frolic in the steamy mists of the natural hot springs...you could read about the band now, more and more, on discerning alterna-sites here and there...or just visit their homepage.  But what you won't learn about them on the interweb is that they secretly and deliberately have been stealing all the best moves in music and concocting this album as a means to propel their mother Iceland to fabled musical-mecca status so that instead of English or Chinese the world will all want to speak their language.  Don't fret if you don't already...you won't need to understand a word to understand what they're REALLY trying to say here.  The lyric sheet basically translates into: \\"We're going to take over your heart, your scene, your country and then the world.\\"I'm not afraid.  Heil Sigur Rós!  <br /> <br />File this one under \\"what every band in the world would love to accomplish.\\"  It's rock, it's classical, it's rap and country (except without so much of the rap or country) and a testament to mankind's ability to create and invent.  I'd call it \\"ethereal\\" if I wanted to risk your running to the dictionary instead of to the record store first.  Let's just say this album would be what could have happened if the Beatles lived on a funkier island, had cuter chicks to impress, and didn't just do it for the money.  Yes, yes...and spoke icelandic. <br /> <br />Honestly, I probably couldn't tell you where one song starts and the other begins as the album's tracks have been fused together so artistically...But you'll be too busy kicking yourself for not having known about these guys earlier to be able to decide which is your favorite track.  Assigning genre?  Pointless.  Just embrace it and accept it, guys.  That cute girl with the hoodie and the ipod you always see on the way to work already has....girls? so has that sensitive, well dressed fella you've been meaning to give the time of day to.  It's time to see what music has been doing while you were away.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|All I have to say, is that this is my favorite Keaton movie and my favorite romantic comedy!  I love her in Reds, Annie Hall and Mrs. Soffel, but for me, this was her best performnace (so far)...Nancy Meyers is a great director and who doesn't like Nicholson.  Warning guys, it is a chick-flick, but a great date movie!
0743496728|4.0|I came into this book wanting to dislike it.  I mainly read lesser known books by the literati.  I am naturally biased against bestsellers. <br /> <br />I only found one flaw in the book:  That the judge apparently had a position that required her to work in Keene, Concord, and Nashua.  If you look at a map of New Hampshire, this is one hell of a travel especially should it be snowing. <br /> <br />That said, this book was surprisingly good.  Basically, the message is that we should punish those that commit crimes, but we should also be attempting to understand the why behind the crime.  If we do not learn why these things happen, then we will never learn to help avert them in the future. <br /> <br />Last, one nit about other comments.  Those complaining that the child's mother would not try the case in reality obviously didn't keep reading.  The mother did not preside over the trial.

0743496728|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading the beautifully written books by Jodi Picoult and I was certainly not disappointed with 'Nineteen Minutes\\" - it is a brilliant book, and makes one think long and hard as to why so many school shootings happen... I found this book to be one that one just didn't want to put down, it was responsible for many late nights!   Every character is drawn so well that one feels one knows the person intimately.   I noticed that '19 Minutes' soared up to No.1 on the New York Times booklist, within a week of being published, and I am not surprised at all - it deserves to stay there for some time.   Don't miss this book!
B000MV9026|1.0|This is a great movie - if you're four years old. Maybe.   Seriously, boy is this movie a ridiculous mess. The plot is just completely inane and the movie's tone is dumbed down and embarrassing. The musical numbers are all completely cringe worthy. It's like watching a bad contestant on American Idol except not as funny. Really, wow, this movie stinks. The only worthwhile thing about the DVD is in the extras - there's an old cartoon that Happy Feet is apparently based on. Watch that and you'll see something actually entertaining and witty.   P.S. Robin Williams hasn't been funny in 20 years.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This is one of those movies so bad it's great!  OTT? Yep.  Realistic...snort...this is Hollywood, mind.  You want real?  Watch Discovery Channel.  I think, this movie makes it clear it's out for fun and to pull the heartstrings.  A Doggie attacking Godzilla?  Fix my parking tickets?  Stay in the White House for six months?  Tell them who shot Kennedy?  If you are wanting realism, you are barking up the wrong tree.  Obviously, the movie doesn't take itself serious, but is out for sheer fun.<br /><br />Pop a bowl of popcorn, turn up the home movie system and kick back.  It's funny, it's silly, it's corny, it defies all logic at times, but it's damn fun entertainment.  I think sometimes we forget a movie is just a movie - meant to give us an escape for 2 hours or so.  I laughed, sniggered, and like a sap, cried at this fluff.<br /><br />Sometimes you just need B-movies to get away from it all for a while.  So this one earns a place on my keeper shelf next to The Queen of Outer Space, Forbidden Planet, The Thing (both versions) and The Day the Earth Stood Still.<br /><br />Buscemi is worth the ticket alone!!
B000F8O35U|4.0|\\"The Little Mermaid\\" is a pretty colourful, entertaining piece of Disney animation, with allusions to the older Disney styles (like the way the bubbles are animated, and some of the people above water, etc). It sees Ariel, the youngest daughter of King Triton of the Merpeople, fall in love with a prince and catching the attention of a sea-witch who helps her become human, on tricky conditions and in exchange for Ariel's beautiful voice. I quite like the expressions Ariel has when she has no voice. It's quite nicely animated, and worth watching for Disney fans.
B00004SW9R|4.0|If you want to know where \\"out there\\" is, this is it. A compelling mixture of jazz, funk, voodoo and chemicals. But, to dismiss this as just a piece of strangeness is really missing a large part of why this is special. Listen to the percussion work on I Walk On Guilded Spinter for example, it's certainly noteworthy. There are also numerous places where the other musicians get to shine as well. Everyone in the band is also on the same page here. Having said that, the only remotely marketable cut on here is Mama Roux. As for the rest, well...  The fact that this is still available is scary. A 23 year old friend of mine, upon hearing Gris-Gris and Guilded Splinters, told me that I \\"need Jesus\\"! If you want a real dose of the 60's, buy this. There is nothing else quite like it . Just do NOT play this in public, they will throw a net over you.
B00004W50T|5.0|One of the greats, absolute must have. Also needed to accompany this is Dylan's \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"The Basement Tapes\\". Beside these 3 albums the rest seems no more than background noise. Songwriting, singing, musicianship par excellence, how come it has gone so far down in the USA since this? Maybe because these musicians were from Canada in the first place?    PS some of the best tracks on  this CD IMHO are those missing from original vinyl - \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\", \\"Katie's Been Gone\\", \\"Long Distance Operator\\", \\"Orange Juice Blues\\" - so even if you have the original vinyl, lucky person, you need this CD  too :)

B000N3SRRC|4.0|These guys just keep putting out top notch albums. What I have always loved about Clutch is the fact that they constantly evolve without losing the classic Clutch sound. It is interesting to go back and put on Pitchfork then listen to all of their albums in order. Constantly growing and changing, never boring or repetitive. This album builds on the Blues/Gospel direction they moved into on Robot Hive but takes it more to the level of Blues/Southern Rock and keeping their heavy riffs and beats. Fallon's lyrics, as always, are very entertaining with a sense of humor. Every time I listen to this album I find sonmething new about it that I like and as always I look forward to hearing whatever they come up with next.
B00011D1OA|2.0|I have the Laser Disc version of this film along with the special features.  I bought the DVD for convenience sake.  But, this pressing is not in the same league.  The DVD is not so sharp visually (which I could live with) but the sound track is terribly distorted.  In particular the choral numbers are unlistenable.  Even the two serving maids who sing along with Eliza's \\"I could have danced...etc\\" are distorted.  With all the advanced technology available to modern pressing plants, is this the best they could do?  I have many vintage film musicals and a large collection of older opera performances which have now been released on DVD and this \\"My Fair Lady\\" is easily the worst as far as sound is concerned.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I have never written a critique here on Amazon, but I really feeled compelled to make a short commentary on this \\"movie\\". If I save even one unsuspecting movie fan from wasting precious time and money watching this movie, then my work is done, and I think the person who said that this movie is the \\"Blade Runner\\" of the 21st century should have to spend all of eternity locked in a small car with Paris Hilton and have to listen to her wax philosophic. <br />In a nutshell, three talented actors/actress trudging through this movie with no cohesive plot, un-inspired direction, and no development at all of what by any measure is a pretty thin story to begin with. No kids are being born. Does anyone know why? No. Does anyone seem to care? Not really, I think at some point someone may have mumbled something about pollution or global warming, or something. After having sat through this movie, I think I know why there are no kids being born; its because many of the movies that come out any more SUCK! They prefer oblivion to a life where art and originality seems to have died, and who can blame them. <br />And the ending, I wont spoil it, but when you see it you will say, what's  up with that... its like they ran out of film in the middle of a scene, and just decided to call it good. <br /> <br />Dont say no one tried to warn you!
B0002JJBZY|3.0|NBC airs Star Trek (original series) early Monday morning now.  As I watch these old episodes on my HDTV, I am just floored by the remastering - the colors, the details, the sound, etc.  The remastered episodes cannot be the same ones in this DVD set based on the reviews I've read.   <br />I must have watched each episode  nearly 100 times in my life, so believe me when I tell you there were more than just touch-ups done on these episodes aired on NBC.  They digitally altered and replaced original scenes.  You'll notice significant changes on every scene in space.  The Enterprise, planets and other spaceships are greatly enhanced and even reconfigured, and you'll get different camera angles of the Enterprise from the original scenes.   <br />Whatever they are showing on NBC, I want it!!!  Your eyes are the best judge.  Just set your DVR to record one of these late-night airings, and you'll want these DVDs too.
0618680004|2.0|I first read Francis Collins \\"The Language of God\\" only because I noticed it in the bookstore first.  Collins (for those of you who do not know) was the head of the Human Genome Project and arguably is more scientifically credible than Dawkins.  He also is an evolutionist and a Christian.  I then read Dawkins and was hoping he would counter Collins reason for theism.  He did not.   <br />Dawkins chapter on \\"The Roots of Morality\\" the one that should have countered Collins did not address why for example an Oskar Schindler would do what he did, a completely selfless act for people from whom he could not benefit in any way.  Each of his examples, genetic kinship, reciprocal altruism, reputation, advertising, misfiring redirection of kin- and reciprocation-based compassion, Hauser and Singer's study, policing and the Kantian imperative do not address this.  In Schindler's case, he engaged in a personal sacrifice with no knowledge or hope of any kind of reward.  Dawkins does not demonstrate how evolutionary theory could explain this.  It appears that Schindler's actions stem from his belief that what he was doing was just the 'right' thing to do. <br />To my surprise, peppered throughout the chapter is his own dependency on moral absolutes to make some of his arguments.  Moral absolutes point to a maker of moral absolutes and therefore contradict the atheist.  For example, on the subject that a theist might argue that their reason for behaving constructively is to avoid divine retribution he writes, \\"If you agree that, in the absence of God, you would `commit robbery, rape, and murder', you reveal yourself as an immoral person, `and we should be well advised to steer a wide course around you'.\\" (p. 227).  But what does Dawkins mean by his judgment of an \\"immoral person\\"?  He can only be referring to such a person's reason for behaving `right' not for their actual behavior or intended behavior since this theist has already resolved to act constructively in society.   Butif that is true, where is he getting his standard of what is a `right' reason to behave right or a `wrong' reason to behave right other than appealing to the moral absolute of right and wrong reasons to behave right, and a law that says we `ought' to do what is right for the `right' reasons.  According to him, he believes we all should know that committing robbery, rape and murder to avoid punishment is not conforming to the right behavior for the `right' reason.  In stating this, he is declaring a moral absolute.  But the problem with that is moral absolutes can only come from a source outside of the human race.   <br />Even patriotism is not an absolute as he seems to think it might be.  A moral absolute means that a certain behavior is right (or wrong) for all people at all times.  With patriotism, there are situations in which it ought to be suppressed and other times in which it ought to be encouraged.   The patriotism of the Nazi's was condemned because it was unjust; it should have been suppressed by all Germans.  But knowing this points the justice as being the absolute, not patriotism.  Dawkins did write, \\"it is pretty hard to defend absolutist morals on grounds other than religious ones.\\" (p. 232). <br />Dawkins is very intelligent on biology.  That goes without saying.  But in order to provide an argument against theism, he has to counter the points made by Collins and ironically himself.  As a result, I am still waiting. <br />
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is such a truly amazing movie!  Its one of those movies that you first tune in to for the music, and then realize that it is an inspiring movie.  The story of Glenn Holland, a fictional music teacher, who is ousted from his position after 30 years, is extremely touching.  At first you don't want to like this man, who thought that he could write a symphony while teaching high school music, but you grow to love him as you see him interact with his students throughout the years. If you like Music of the Heart check out Mr. Holland's Opus.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|It's impossible to say whether future generations will one day look back on Al Gore as \\"the man who saved the planet,\\" but they will at least be able to point to the documentary \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" as the key factor in leading the ex-Vice President back from the political wilderness.<br /><br />Once an object of ridicule and scorn for many on both sides of the political aisle, Gore has recently achieved near-rock star status thanks largely to his unwavering commitment to awakening the people of  the world to the very-real dangers posed by global warming.  Armed with charts, graphs, photographs, and an unbridled passion that is truly infectious, Gore makes a convincing case in this film not only that global warming is indeed real but that if we don't act now to counter its influence, the world we live in will soon be a much less hospitable place in which to raise our kids and grandkids.  Given the evidence that has piled up over recent years backing his claims, it's hard for even the most cynical among us not to see Gore in oracular terms.<br /><br />\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is essentially a big screen version of the sophisticated slide show that Gore has been presenting for years to largely sympathetic audiences.  What's most surprising, given his reputation for pomposity, condescension and stiffness, is just how relaxed, witty and avuncular Gore appears on screen as he ever so patiently and succinctly lays out material and data that could, in less capable hands, have come across as dry, arcane and incomprehensible to a less than scientifically literate lay audience.  The movie also shows how some of the events in his own personal life - the near-death of his son in an accident, the bitter loss of the election in 2000 - awakened Gore's consciousness and led him to educate himself and take the lead on an issue that has always meant so much to him.<br /><br />Like any good social crusader, Gore first raises public awareness of the problem then offers concrete steps that individuals, corporations and governments can take to help solve it.  With the spirit of a revivalist preacher, Gore implores everyone with a conscience to come together and do his part to eradicate the threat before it is too late for any of us to truly make a difference.<br /><br />Of course, the most common criticism leveled against the film is that it is little more than anti-capitalist leftwing propaganda, a slanted screed that provides only one side of the argument and that is essentially designed to make big business and the political right look like villains.  And, indeed, unlike in, say, a \\"60 Minutes\\" segment on the topic, director Davis Guggenheim does not provide equal time - or, to be honest, any time at all - to dissenting voices to make their case.  In fact, there are no interviews even with scientists who SUPPORT the claims being put forth by the film, a weakness that has allowed dissenters to charge Gore with playing fast and loose with the facts.  This has also led to the second most commonly stated criticism against the film, which is that it comes across at times like a vanity production designed more to rehabilitate Mr. Gore`s reputation than to make a legitimate scientific case for global warming.  I guess it would be possible to make such an argument against the movie, but the literature sure seems to back Gore on his assertions, and his commitment to the issue certainly comes across as both deep-seated and genuine.  He is, after all, no Johnny-come-lately to the scene, having devoted much of his adult life to the cause, long before it was trendy to do so.<br /><br />For most free-thinking, forward-looking people, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" will be both an eye-opening and a mind-opening experience.  For those who don`t fall into that category, it may soon be time to break out the surfboards and get ready to ride the waves down  5th Avenue.rete steps that individuals, corporations and governments can take to help solve it.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|Hoo-wee is this a stinker of a movie.  It's nonsensical, and in addition it makes no sense.  I hate to compare it to another movie, because that's unfair, but it's a lot like Tron (another movie about the future) but with like zero special effects.  Which brings me to point #1: how do you make a movie about the future with zero special effects?  Hello?  It's the future.  This future looks like downtown New Jersey! <br /> <br />Secondly I do not like movies about there being no more babies, because I think that children are our future, so right there I have a big problem with the storyline.  How do you make a movie about the future (with children in the title, no less!) in a future with no kids?  Tron had kids (and neon-electric special effects, I might add) <br /> <br />The main character is played by Michael Caine and he is some kind of future hippie who lives with his wife in a secret lair.  Meanwhile, Julianne Moore and Clive Owen drive around escorting this pregnant lady whle the world goes to heck in a handbasket.  It's reminiscent of Total Recall, but nobody injects probes into their nose while holograms say \\"get your *ss to Mars.\\"  By the way--are their other planets in this future?  That's just lazy filmmaking to not discuss this important point. <br /> <br />Basically by the end of the movie, it's like a war movie with Clive Owen running around everywhere, and he never even picks up a gun, which is silly with so many people shooting at him.  He'd be dead real quick in any of the futures I've ever dreamed about. <br /> <br />If you want to check out a much better movie about children and the future, do yourself a favor and rent \\"Look Who's Talking Now\\" which takes place in the future after \\"Look Who's Talking\\" and \\"Look Who's Talking Too.\\"  You will hear babies thinking and talking, and the fabulous John Travolta, and at the end you will have learned a lot about the importance of procreation and what it means to have a good time.
B00005JPMC|3.0|Though little more than a strung-together collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clich&eacute;s, \\"Shooter\\" provides a veritable feast for conspiracy-theory paranoiacs and a decent enough time at the movies for the rest of us.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, an embittered ex-marine gunnery sergeant who's been living a hermitlike existence ever since he and his sharpshooter buddy were left to perish on an Ethiopian hillside by the American forces that had sent them on the mission in the first place. After three years holed up in the wilderness of Wyoming with no one but his devoted pooch to keep him company, Swagger is coaxed out of retirement by the FBI to help foil a planned assassination of the President of the United States. When Swagger discovers at the last minute that he is actually being set up as the fall guy for the killing, he barely escapes with his life and spends the rest of the movie dodging the authorities while attempting to clear his name and bring the true culprits to justice.<br /><br />Wahlberg, all brooding stoicism and macho-man swagger (pardon the pun), continues his run of tough guy roles in this film, though one wishes he would return to the more nuanced, multi-layered portrayals he managed to put forth in movies like \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Three Kings.\\" Kate Mara is likable and attractive as the woman who befriends Swagger. But the most compelling performance is by Michael Pena as the low-level FBI agent who believes Swagger is innocent of the crime and who winds up joining forces with Swagger to uncover the conspiracy. The Average Joe demeanor that Pena brings to the character provides a proper counterbalance to Wahlberg's strutting self-confidence and superhuman athleticism. Danny Glover seems to be phoning in much of his performance here as the leader of the covert FBI cabal, and Ned Beatty does his best as a stereotypically smarmy senator who's up to his ears in venality and corruption.<br /><br />The plot often doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it is easy for a layperson to get lost in all the arcane machinations that come flying fast and loose off the screen. Still, the screenplay does a nice job fitting the pieces of its puzzle together, merging the two story lines that run along parallel tracks for the first half into a unified whole at about the midway point. The action scenes are strikingly well done, even though they often sacrifice verisimilitude and plausibility for mass explosions and preposterously lopsided gun battles.<br /><br />The movie makes a lot of grand speeches at the end about governmental corruption and what it truly means to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, but \\"Shooter\\" is designed to be a generic thriller not a big-think social drama. And, on those terms only, the movie succeeds more often than it fails.make a whole lot of sense, and it is easy for a layperson to get lost in all the arcane machinations that come flying fast and loose off the screen.

B000LXHK2C|1.0|I was really expecting to enjoy this movie. Alas, it starts out with what seems like a good premise but before you know it Russel Crowe is doing prat falls in an empty swimming pool. Ouch. (French pools apparently don't have a shallow end OR ladders, so if you fall into one you're in for some laughs until someone throws you a rope)     Some of the plot is downright inexplicable. (The vintner is trying to convince Crowe NOT to sell the land by conspiring to make him think that the wine they make there is terrible? Huh?) At one point Crowe's love interest even acuses him of being, \\"Another one of those people who thinks I live in Provence because I have to!\\" Oooookay. Do a lot of folks look down on people who are FORCED to live in Provence? Is having people scoff at you for living in one of the most beautiful regions of France really a big issue for the locals?     Throw in the obligatory uncouth American tourists, some nonsense about lavender and scorpians, and some silly fast-motion driving in circles and what you end up with is a jaw dropping disapointment. (Let's face it, when a director stoops to fast-motion footage of a car going in cirles it's time to raise the white flag.) I got the feeling that everyone just wanted to spend some time in Provence and churned this baby out so that they could expense it all. Oh, and the award for the most inappropriate and god-awful sound track goes to...

B00005JMUA|3.0|I liked the first volume, despite the fact that it was mostly plotless, because it was very pretty in all its carnage.  Volume 2, however, spends a lot of time on a plot that bothered me more and more when I thought about it.  In the end, I found it overly simplistic and irritating (trying not to give anything away here).  I kept waiting for a twist that never came.  While the first volume was mostly fluff, a lot of style with no substance, it was enjoyable as that at least.  The second volume has more plot, but this does not end up as more substance.  But in the second volume, the time that is spent on the plot takes away from the style and we end up with two and a half hours which are not very enjoyable.
B000EGF0NW|1.0|This is my second Alice Sebold book and it is my last.  This book was so drawn out and pathetic.  She made the bad thing that happen to her effect her entire life.  Move on, a terrible thing happened to you ok we get it.  I think there was a total lack of subject matter, blah, blah, blah so, what else and then there was nothing.  A true disappointment after Lovely Bones.  Alice please go back to your previous style of writing and leave the single tragedies to someone that can expand their knowledge.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Whether you like this movie depends completely on you. <br /> <br />Either you will like the fight scenes, which are pretty awesome, and ignore the fact that there is not much of a plot (especially in this first volume), or you will keep waiting for something to happen besides a bunch of people getting killed and be completely disappointed. <br /> <br />That being said, I enjoyed watching this first volume.  It was much better than the second volume, which spends a lot of time on a plot which I could not stand.  Someone who is expecting something other than a lot of graceful carnage, however, will not enjoy it.
020530902X|5.0|O'Reilly sent me this book after I signed my first contract. I bought it long before that and never really absorbed it. I started taking the train to work back in September, but I didn't start reading it until I started another job going north instead of south.<br /><br />Now I understand why so many people have said I would fail to get the craft until I read this book with total comprehension. I spend days and days on the first 10 pages and learned more about writing that I had after writing 16 books. I feel empowered and recommend it to any one who wants to make their living as a writer.<br /><br />Consider this the most important document you'll ever read. But read it every day because you'll never get it completely unless you do.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I found it difficult to consider this a portrayal but once I remembered occupying a set as I took part in several films, it finally hit me. This film is a story and a portrayal of the Passion.<br /><br />I don't wear religion on my shirt sleeve. In the secular day to day existence  of America, we have peer bias against religion. So, out in the world of commerce, I keep this part of my life private.<br /><br />The history of the life of Jesus Christ doesn't fit the convention investigative techniques by which I learned my stock and trade. The life of Christ does make sense using a different paradigm of history - the model of how people kept track of events before we had IBM PCs.<br /><br />Now, some things you cannot explain. But, explain it or not, we know the truth. That's correct. Deep down inside we know the reality - the what is of existence. This film operates in that zone.<br /><br />The quality of the portrayal reflects the remarkable film making of Mel Gibson and his fabulous cast and crew. Even if you don't believe, I strongly recommend the film. Just for the art form, the Passion of the Christ gets the job done. Students of this art form will learn how to pace action and content and take the audience places they didn't know they could go.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Always in the upper echelons of the greatest LP's of all time lists, and deservedly so.<br /><br />One of the few benefits of getting old(er) is the historical perspective that comes with the privilege. For instance, it is one thing to read that this record was, in its time, unique - that it was the very first of its time - a full length soul album dealing with social issues. Curtis had, if I recall correctly, released a couple of great singles. But there was no album. However, when What's Going on was released it was a revelation and a revolution, and to think that Marvin had to fight Motown in order to get it done! Over the last forty-seven year there are many special moments that I recall as special. Obviously the first time I heard the Beatles stands out. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, Clapton, Jimi, the electrified Dylan on Like  a Rolling Stone, Pet Sounds, Pepper, Kind of Blue, Led Zeppelin, In Utero and Thriller - milestones all.  What's Going on belongs with these as a moment of great importance in the history of popular music.  Remember, this was 1971. Less than a decade earlier popular R&B consisted of Stubborn Kind of Fellow and I'll be Doggone. Fabulous songs but miles away from the brilliant relevance of the title track, Mercy Mercy me, Inner City Blues, Right on or Flying High.  What's Going on constitutes a 90 degree turn for Marvin and for popular urban black music. If you are reading this you do not need me to describe the music! Two years later Marvin released Let's Get it on. That's another story.

B000059HB7|5.0|I had not seen this movie in over thirty years, so I had forgotten just how good it was.  To start with, you have John Wayne in the lead. Then you have Dean Martin in one of his few serious roles.  Then comes Ricky Nelson, who could have been a great actor if he had been given a few more serious roles and not simply used as a cameo to bring in the teenage girls.  Angie dickinson, doing her best as romantic interest for a man old enough to be her father.  Then we come to Walter Brennan at his crotchety best. With a cast like this you just have to have a good movie, but add in a plot with more twists than a fifty foot lariat, then top it off with a great song sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson.  Pure entertainment.  No deep philosophy, just lots of action and adventure. Treat yourself to a piece of the time when movies were made for fun.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|I would rate this film with a \\"5\\", but I thought that Helen Mirren was a great disappointment.  She has progressed to being one of the finest of actresses, but I found her performance forced in \\"White Nights\\".  Geraldine Page is annoying, although I suppose she is meant to be;  Isabella Rossellini plays herself, as usual.  That disposes of the female players...all of whom I have enjoyed in other movies.  And, of course, they are not the stars. <br />It is certainly a delight to be able to watch Baryshnikov's performance over and over.  I prefer the dancing of Gregory Hines, however. In addition, if Hines was the actual singer of the number from \\"Porgy and Bess\\", he was certainly a performer to match Baryshnikov--although I'm sure most dance lovers would disagree.  But Hines seemed to be a supreme actor, singer and dancer.  When Baryshnikov and Hines came to dancing the jazz duet near the end of the film, I would bet that many people, at least silently, decided whom they thought was the more talented and/or enjoyable dancer.  Although Baryshnikov is \\"perfect\\", Hines' dancing was more interesting, looser.  When they performed a triple(?)pirouette, Hines seemed to lose count, but there is something funkier about being both great and able to make mistakes.   <br />Hines is gone, and Baryshnikov is 59 now.  Having this near-documentary of their excellence is fortunate for all dance lovers, especially since the duo of virtuosos with opposite styles makes this a movie one can watch repeatedly.
6305907145|2.0|Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled.  Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film \\"relevant\\" to today's \\"hip\\" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated).  While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film.  As is often the case, viewers will find that \\"the book is much better than the movie.\\"  The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|I remember Sep 11 like this: I was visiting in Shanghai, came to my hotel room in the evening, not so late, turned on CNN as usual, and saw a plane fly into one of the towers. It took me quite some time to understand what I had just seen. I called my wife and asked her to turn on TV at home. She had not heard yet.<br />I never felt more American than on that day.<br />I am German, by the way.<br />When I heard that Oliver Stone was making a movie about this, I could not believe it. Too early, too monumental, too emotionally loaded, too ideologically simple. This could only become a bad film.<br />It hasn't. It is a simple story about confusion and heroism and survival. Well done.<br />You never see a plane fly into anything. You only hear people talk about it, but there are also some who don't believe it. It shows you the segmented vision of people who are near the center. People watching TV in Shanghai probably knew more of what actually happened right at the time than those caught in the middle of it.<br />Stone stays away from explicit interpretation, he leaves that to the spectator.
B00005MP58|5.0|This multipart BBC adaptation is extremely faithful to this beloved novel by Jane Austen.  While many young people might be smitten by the version starring Kiera Knightly (sp?), it's this version they should view if they really want to understand the novel.  Even then, the book is still better, but this dramatization is faithful and true, beautifully filmed and acted.  Very nice.

6304712499|5.0|I decided to express my view on the Spawn movie, VHS, after I read some pathetic reviews posted here; one compared it to Spiderman, YUCH! {First let me say the Spiderman movie sucked. I found it too cartoonish and juvenile with exposed cow-teats from the get-go to sexually arouse and harass children, adolescents and immature adults.]<br /><br />Now on to Spawn. I loved Spawn, VHS. I found the CGI, bluescreen {whatever) to be well done BUT NOT OVERDONE. I found the movie content to be mature and comical. I also enjoyed seeing an African American in the title role of a quality film; which is certainly not the norm.<br /><br />Summarizing, I DO NOT enjoy seeing women expose their private parts for sexual harassment [that's what ADULT saloons and burlesque is for] and I do not enjoy cartoonish film [animated]; I prefer action movies to be REAL ACTION, Ala Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, WELL DONE!
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|For all reading this review I am referring to the March 2007 re-release of this milestone album. It was remastered and remixed as part of the 4oth anniversary Doors celebration. In the liner notes it is stated that the remaing Doors used the original master tapes, and remixed them to reveal subtleties not revealed in any previous release of this cd (They've done the same for all six studio albums) . The result is astounding. Morrisons voice cuts you like a knife, Manzareks keyboards are front and center, and you can hear the details of Kriegers' very focused playing. Certain songs have extra time on them. For example, the fade on \\"Love Her Madly\\" extends a bit more, and you hear a previously unreleased part of the original intro to \\"LA Woman\\". The sheer clarity of the recording reveals that  \\"Riders on the storm\\" is even errier than when we first heard it back in 1971.  This release of LA Woman is THE definitive version for anyone who loves the Doors. It's a rock/blues  drenched masterpiece that transcends time, and its remix is simply amazing. I wish Jim were here to listen to it  ....he'd be smiling for sure.

1582701709|1.0|I am constantly amazed at how many self-appointed gurus are eager to proclaim the latest formulaic \\"secret\\" for indulging in every imaginable fantasy through magical thinking.  Even more amazing is how many people buy into it. The formula is simple.  Pander to the latest vogue in so-called \\"new age\\" thinking and add a sprinkling of traditional wisdom for faux credibility.  The Tibetans have a term for it.  \\"An admixture of gold dust and yak dung.\\"    The late Alan Watts made a humorous comparison between institutional Zen and institutional psychiatry in which he stated that, \\"Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined, and anyone who goes to a Zen master deserves 30 blows of the stick (kyosaku).\\"  Perhaps we all get the guru we ask for.    \\"There isn't any special method.  Attaching to thoughts, you get carried away in delusion and sidetracking yourself.  So give it up.  That's all there is to it\\"  -Zen Master Bankei (1622-1693)
B000000WCA|5.0|This CD is great because although there is no musical value to what is recorded on it, you can still use it for things.  I used it one day to scrape the gum off my shoe.  Another day my friend used it to scrape scum off the inside of a toilet.  After that we cleaned it up and then used it of course, as a coaster!  It was so rewarding to see it slowly get beat to a pulp but still not use value.  Eventually it got cracked and then I just threw it in the trash.  So yes people, although the musical value on it is a big fat nada casta, you can still not feel bad and use it for other things, like scraping gum off of a gym floor or something.
B000MG1ZGA|1.0|Yes, the sound is great but the tracks are remixed, often with new vocal and instrumental parts. These are NOT the original mixes! Caveat emptor!
B000NA28IE|3.0|A couple years ago, a good friend of mine told me she was reading \\"Eragon.\\" I had never heard of the book, so eventually I asked her what it was about. She told me it was about a young man who found a stone in the forest, except it wasn't a stone, it was a dragon egg. Interest piqued, she loaned me her copy.    I read it, and it was an engaging read, though I did have some qualms about the use of magic. Altogether though, I was not too impressed. Christopher Paolini, though I'd give him high marks for an original story, was obviously inspired by \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" An unlikely hero emerging, a powerful mentor, unexpected new friends, dwarves and elves, evil rulers, beings who were almost incarnate evil, dangerous magical devices, were all little things that reminded me of Tolkien's series. (As reviews of the book state, the editor should have done a better job.)    However, with the fantasy epic movie trend, I was not surprised to hear \\"Eragon\\" was on the way to the big screen. I don't go to the movies often, so I passed up going to see it.    When the DVD came out, however, I went ahead and bought the 2-disc edition. Not every book I've read has been made into a big movie.    Having written four \\"epic fantasy\\" fan screenplays (the last three all part of a six-part series) and having listened to a lot about current tastes and how to write movies, I was unable to look at \\"Eragon\\" without judging it by certain standards.    The basic storyline was kept. Sadly, a lot of character development was overlooked in favor of \\"cool special effects and cool dramatic scenes!\\" Maybe the screenwriter and director thought further character development would make the movie too long \\"and too long is too boring,\\" they likely thought. This is not always true. Peter Jackson was able to pull off a scene with Frodo and Gandalf having a powerful conversation in Moria without making it boring, and all they do is talk! Perhaps the crew would've done better to get some ideas from \\"Lord of the Ring's\\" writing rather than effects...    One storyline that took several chapters in the book was dropped: a search for a poisonous oil, leading Eragon, Brom, and Saphira to Dras-Leona, a town under the shadow of a satanic \\"church.\\" This was a good excision, so as not to offend the religious audiences who thrilled to \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Rings.\\" But this was practically the only good thing that was dropped from the book, although it meant Brom had to die another way. (In the book, he is killed trying to leave Dras-Leona.)    Because of the writer's \\"let's drop the boring bits\\" philosophy, Arya's poisoning, a real page-turner for me in the book, was played down to one scene. A lot of Eragon's journeys and training were also cut down to a unsatisfying and unbelievable minimum. (If Eragon really as much training as he had on screen, he would've been dead meat!) And the \\"deleted scenes\\" on disc 2? Yeah, the movie could've used those put back in.    Saphira's development was a big disappointment: she grows to her full size in one short scene (hard to take, even in a fantasy film), while at the end of the book, she's big enough for one rider, but still growing. When she breathes fire at Farthen-Dur, Eragon looks too grim at the sight. It's her first time breathing fire: he should be surprised.    One thing that \\"Rings,\\" \\"Narnia,\\" and even older fantasy classics like \\"Return to Oz\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" left me with, just after the first viewing, was how memorable the music was. I could hum, whistle, or sing a bit of music from the film right off. In \\"Eragon,\\" I can't remember how any of the music plays. Avril Lavigine's song at the end sounded too modern for the film. The songs at the end of the \\"Rings\\" movies each had a specific feel for the supposed period and plot of the story, while Imogen Heap's \\"I Can't Take It In\\" captured the wonder of \\"Narnia\\" perfectly.    EDIT: Upon listening to the film's score, I was disappointed again. Every track seemed to re-use the same forgettable theme! The theme was even re-used for a song that I assume is after the Avril Lavigine song during the credits, which I didn't watch all the way through.    I haven't watched all the special features, but the way the second disc is set up is awful: you select different parts of the map to find special features with only the names of the locations to guide you. This would be fine had there been a guide telling me WHERE to look for the desired features. All you get is a list. (Come on, the DVDs for \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Rings\\" had printed guides with elaborate special features trees!)    EDIT: Over a month later, I still haven't bothered with all of the special features.    I did decide to give Paolini another shot and read \\"Eldest,\\" which dissappoints as a sequel to the book. Maybe such a treatment would be an improvement!    I would've made this very differently, though. More time for character development, not being afraid of looking like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" NOT letting special effects take over the movie, put Angela's cat back in, and so on and so forth... The Film Industry really needs me.    3 out of 5 stars for weak writing, adaptation, and editing, but impressive special effects and actually telling A story.

B00006DEFA|3.0|I loved the orginal release. However, even though this directors cut has a lot more interesting scenes which are definely a plus, the nudity scene that was included completely prevents this from being a family experience. Just dont understand why it had to be included.

0385751060|4.0|This is a great story about the horrors of the Holocaust. It takes a more unique aproach to these horrors. Having read other reviews about this book many say that this is an adult book but I think young adults can handle this. I know I could. This is more subltle than other Holocaust books. I also think that since the youth are our future we need to educate them about these wrongs against man.This book really makes you think and gives a good mental picture of the horrors at these camps. I have been to Aushwitz nothing compares but great literature can be very powerfull. This is a must read book for anybody.

B000N6TX22|1.0|The movie's great, but this wouldn't play in my HD DVD player. Other HD DVD titles I've got play just fine, but not this one. Given that fact, I'm inclined to think it's this title that has the problem (although, I guess I can never rule out the XBox360 HD DVD player having quirks). The only thing that kept it being a 0 rating is that side B has the DVD formatted version, so I at least can watch the movie.

0451219597|5.0|This was a great book, I enjoyed it a lot, there are some books I can read in the train, and just continue it day after day, and there are books like these, where I just have to finish it, and once I do, just wish there was more.. Very interesting, described vivid images.. loved it..
B00005JLSE|5.0|The dance and music and lyrics of Bob Fosse is still going strong, and it is evident through the big-screen adaptation of \\"Chicago\\". Director Rob Marshall stays faithful to Fosse's Broadway intentions, though he does change many things with the way the songs are performed (all songs are sung in reverie settings). Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are very good when going along with their solos (\\"They Both Reached for the Gun\\" is fun and funny), but John C. Reilly, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah steal the show with their dazzling vocals (\\"Mister Cellophane\\", \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" and \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" are well worth the oscar wins).<br /><br />This movie is a splendid achievement, and if you don't even like musicals, then you'll probably be surprised at how much you're going to love this film.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|Released in '97 `Firelight' is a delicate, atmospheric and romantic period film that in my estimation is more than an equal to such well known English classics as `Wuthering Heights' and `Pride and Prejudice.' To compare it with something familiar to movie viewers I would say it has a lot in common with `Jane Eyre' with a little touch of the American tale `The Miracle Worker'.<br /><br />Sophie Marceau is not only beautiful, but delivers a very emotional, controlled performance as the new governess to a wealthy Englishman's daughter. Stephen Dillane also provides a superior performance as the little girls Father and is the perfect choice for Sophie's love interest.<br /><br />`Firelight' has it all; great acting, strong storyline, enchanting soundtrack and lush, sometimes breathtaking cinematography. The sequences filmed of the lake house are magnificent. Don't bother waiting around for a U.S. version to be released, the Asian all region DVD is perfect. Order a copy while they're still available.
0553278223|5.0|I read this book shortly after graduating High School and still read it from time to time.  This collection of short stories is perfect for readers of all genres, be it sci-fi, mystery, romance, suspence & thriller or anything else.   <br /> <br />Bradbury wrote this collection in the 1940's, framing the storyline in the distant future (1999).  Each story is centered around mans arrival and subsequent \\"conquest\\" of the planet Mars, but that the extra-terrestrial location is the only constant in this collection.   <br /> <br />This is not a hard sci-fi book filled with technical terms, theoretical physics and lengthy explanations of how pieces of technology work.  The subject matter is very poetic and philosophical.  You could breeze through this book in a single day, but if you do, read it again, because you're certain to have missed something special in this collection.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I bought the basic edition as a gift and own the two-disc set, which includes a surround-sound mix and a Super Audio DVD hi-def (music) mix.  Since George Martin (and son) were at the controls, I feel comfortable that this is an official Beatles product (not that that's the most important thing).  Sonically, it's a knock-out.  Details you've never heard emerge, even when I listen to the regular CD ripped onto my MP3 player.  The mixes are interesting, sometimes fairly straight-ahead, although tweaked, and sometimes layered with bits and pieces of other Beatles songs and sounds.  Not a definitive Beatles collection, but for those of us who have all the original albums, the Anthology series, and the better-sounding more recent collections (1 and the Yellow Submarine Songtrack), this is an interesting addition to the collection.  Purists might argue that this is not what the Beatles intended, but often, neither were the stereo mixes of the original albums -- even of Sgt. Pepper.  George Martin was largely responsible for so much of the mixing; his ears and musicianship were as much a part of the mix -- and the \\"mix\\" -- that this one counts.  And, simply on its own merits, its just plain fun.  It does serve the live circus performance for which it was created, but if you have the surround system, get the two disc set, put on the DVD (audio disc), close your eyes, relax and float downstream.

I am a huge fan of the chicken soup for the soul books they always inspire me. This book is amazing. You really need to read it more than once to get the full impact because there may be something that didnt' grab you the first time that you really get the second or third time.

Keep the CDs handy in your car and listen over and over as you commute to work or handle your daily errands.

0743496728|4.0|I loved it.  <br />Boiling down everything else I'm going to say, that is pretty much the bottom line.  Picoult has done it again.  She managed to write yet another engrossing drama that pulls you in and makes you sympathize with the characters and feel as though you were a part of the scene.   <br />This one seemed to rise above several of her other novels for me.  A few of her other books kind of have that great rise of suspense where the story builds and builds and really draws you into it only to slam into the back cover.  \\"Boom, I'm bored with this, so I'm just going to throw out this ending and move onto the next one.\\"   <br />Also, I feel that the kids were actually described reasonably life-like... I mean, no offense, but something as tragic and horrid as a school shooting is not going to turn each and every one of the survivors into a saint that is going to love thier fellow student.  Some just can't change.  I like that Picoult embraces that. <br />All in all, I definitely recommend it.
0618680004|5.0|This book will continue the next step in man's evolution toward scientific enlightenment.  Mankind will never rise above the problems we're experiencing until we evolve out of our infancy, and throw away the crutch of religion.  Long ago, men would throw young virgin girls into a volcano in an attempt to get it to save the rest of the world; long ago we viewed a passing comet in the night sky as a \\"sign from god\\" that something bad was about to happen.  Those things sound pretty stupid today right?  In time, all things based on religious \\"fears\\" will sound just as stupid, and mankind will finally be able to move forward in his/her scientific quest to understand the Universe.

6304698526|4.0|Steve McQueen is possibly one of the coolest men of all time.  His presence in a film is enough to make it great.  Besides that, this film is well directed, well planned out.  My major issue with the film is the plot can get a little murky at times and bogs down what is one fantastic action movie.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is incredible! Since it must be viewed with an open mind, this movie is not for everyone. It's dark, gory, and downright disturbing; however, none of that takes away from the fact that it is magnificent. Brad Pitt plays a detective new on the force, and Morgan Freeman plays his partner and mentor. These two men are clearly from opposite ends of the spectrum, which makes the plot even more interesting. Together, the detectives slowly enter the mind of a killer who patterns his crimes after the Seven Deadly Sins. Kevin Spacey plays the insanely psychotic killer who has a surprise twist for the detectives. The climax of Seven is unlike any movie or book out there. It will leave you begging for more. This movie is for anyone that can handle a little bit of gore and a lot of suspense!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I haven't heard the album, but heard the single 'Far Cry'. Normally, a single paves the way for the whole material. I can only find mature work here. <br />Been a longtime Rush fan, and maybe that's why I couldn't try to find the same thing they did 30 years ago. It's not 2112, it's someting new and fresh, it's not Vapor Trails either. I liked it.
0425188809|5.0|This is my favorite Koontz book of all time after reading at least half of his library.  I received Watchers as a Christmas gift in 1999. The gift giver had read the book and knew I was an animal lover who would enjoy the book. Well, I did far more than enjoy the book! It was excellent. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it scared the pants off me, and it still has me in awe every time I think about it. I have read Koontz books before, but this was by far the best. Anyone who loves animals and is a sensitive soul will appreciate the underlying ideas in this book. Hard to put down, so make sure you have plenty of time to devote to the intricate characters in this book. This is Koontz at his best, tugging at your heartstrings while stringing you into the storyline.  Happy Reading!
