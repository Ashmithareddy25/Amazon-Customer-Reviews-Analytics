B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Definitely worth playing .Enough of a challenge to keep my interest. Very good graphics. Even more valuable to me is the lack of an in app cost, which is becoming a major negative app trend.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|I was quite amazed by this movie. I purchased a digital version with extras, which are eye opening interviews about the whole process and about the concept behind it, so much so that i would have enjoyed if those extras would have been shown before the movie.<br />The story is developed from a book, and i stress again that the interviews are really precious as far as showing the amount of thought and the amount of work that went into the making of Cloud Atlas. The attention to details is paramount, it took the team several months to organize it, and i have to say the result is unique.<br />Stories that intersect throughout different centuries, with accomplished actors that play as many as six different characters each. I think especially Tom Hanks was brilliant, in one of his best performances to date.<br />The lesson is about freedom and karma if you will accept the concept even through a westerner's eye, not bound to a specific century nor skin color or social caste.<br />Very good movie, that needs to be watched twice.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|Before purchasing Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut, I read up on all the different version available, particularly the theatrical cut and the director's cut. The general consensus seems to be that the best version was the director's cut. It restores a number of scenes that had been cut from the original release, adding more depth to the characters. Many felt that The Ultimate Cut took things too far by mixing in scenes from Tales of the Black Freighter. It makes the movie much longer and breaks up the rhythm of the live action sequences. I expected to feel the same way, but I didn't. Upon viewing this in its most epic version, I found it to be the best, fullest translation of the original graphic novel.<br /><br />For one thing, I enjoyed the sheer length of it, the degree to which the viewer is plunged into this fascinating world, immersing oneself in the history, characters, and visuals. For another, the graphic novel itself had a broken flow to it, ending each chapter with special sections, mixing in the Black Freighter sequences. Adding those scenes into this version gave me that same sense and tone of the reading experience.<br /><br />You've probably at least seen the theatrical release and have read the graphic novel if you're looking into buying the Ultimate Cut, so I won't discuss the plot at all. Suffice it to say, it's very rich and fascinating, bringing up ideas that linger long after the movie ends. The visuals are great, and acting is excellent, with the exception of Malin Akerman as the Silk Spectre II. She's subpar (to be kind) but doesn't ruin the movie. It's just a shame that she couldn't be on the level of the other actors, particularly Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl.<br /><br />The extended film is the primary reason to invest in this set, but there's also the motion comic, which is a nice, if unnecessary addition, and some good extras. Overall, I'm very pleased with this set. For some, it'll be too much, and they would likely be best served by the director's cut. Nothing wrong with that. But for me, the ultimate cut lives up to its name.r's cut. Nothing wrong with that. But for me, the ultimate cut lives up to its name.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this app! Not super challenging but still makes you think. I was addicted as soon as I played the first level.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book showed me a whole  other side of things. I couldn't put it down! I got wrapped up in the story and never wanted it to end. Amazing book and so well written.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As someone who lived through 2nd wave feminism, many of the points Sheryl makes did not surprise or enlighten me. I've known about and experienced similar dynamics throughout my own career. However, I think this book will be valuable to early and mid-career women who care about the quality of their work and of their workplace. I echo Sheryl's encouragement for men to join the quest for equity in boardrooms and other leadership roles. I particularly enjoyed how generously she shared her own story.
0525478817|5.0|I am glad I did not read the synopsis before I bought the book. Having lost someone very dear to cancer I usually stay away from this topic.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book. The extraordinary talent of Mr. Green resides in portraying cancer patients as people, not as their disease. His raw, bold and sometimes brutal writing is longed-for in a state of affairs where profound and poetic texts are not the norm but the exception.<br /><br />Agustus and Hazel will say with me for a long, long time....<br />\\"It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\\"<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Green.
1423113462|3.0|By this point, Riordan's plots are old news--classical mythology upcycled with a modern setting and a slightly different progression of events. It's up to the characters to make or break the books--in this case, the new main trio of narrators, Jason, Piper, and Leo. Taken by himself, Jason isn't bad. His memory loss is an interesting plot device, he's generally a pleasant narrator, and he has a seriously cool godly ability. After Percy, having a leader who knew what he was doing from the get-go (even if he couldn't remember how he knew) was a good choice. Being a history nerd, I enjoyed the Roman aspects he brought to the story. Piper, however... as far as I'm concerned, Piper has no redeeming qualities beyond her cool name. She's irritating, insecure, always hurt, and has the most laughable godly ability of all time. Remember those old Pokemon GameBoy games when one pokemon would use attract and the opponent would fall in love with it and wouldn't attack anymore? That's Piper. While Jason calls down lightning and Leo shoots fire and slams around construction equipment, Piper stands around and channels her inner Jigglypuff.<br /><br />What's worse is that putting Piper and Jason anywhere near each other brings them both down. No matter which one of them is narrating, you can guess the chapter will go something like this: Danger from last chapter resolved. Jason/Piper angst. Plot. Jason/Piper is so good looking. More plot (maybe). Angst about how good looking Jason/Piper is.<br /><br />For. Five. Hundred. Pages.<br /><br />Luckily for the two of them, there is also Leo. Oh, Leo. Leo is the antidote for all things Piper. To start with, he's laugh-out-loud hilarious 90% of the time, but he's not limited to being comic relief (see: Grover Underwood). Leo is incredibly useful at all times, and his godly ability is every bit as cool as Jason's. More importantly, his back story is beautifully written and genuinely heartbreaking. His present journey throughout the book rings just as true. He is a truly empathetic character that can make me laugh and cry in the space of a single page. I would go so far as to say Leo is the real Midas of the story, insofar as everything he touches is gold. Festus is the best non-human sidekick we've seen so far. Hephaestus is the most believable godly parent. I would even nominate Leo's tool belt as the best prop in both series. Leo is seriously the best character Riordan has ever written.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not even Leo can save Riordan from himself. The sheer size of this book is its downfall. Riordan includes so many different characters from the classical myths that he spends half the book just contextualizing all of them. As many of these characters are villains, this means that literally every battle has pages and pages of monologuing to tell the trio who the person is, what their original story was, how they're here now, and why they're going to kill them. This, in turn, removes any trace of tension from scenes that should be overflowing with it. There were literally times I had to put the book down because Piper (of course, Piper) had been dialoging with a villain for the past ten pages while Jason and Leo fought off a dragon ten feet away.<br /><br />This egregious lack of editing, combined with the irritation Jason and Piper induced every time they were within half a continent of each other, made me seriously considering leaving a two-star review. The awesome power of Leo coupled with the intriguing lead-in to book two convinced me to go one higher.

B007L6VR6M|5.0|A tear-jerker it is not but still touching as it plays out young love, very young love. The entire cast is great. Some are cast out of their usual roles, Edward Norton, for instance, which really adds to the flavor of the movie. The exploration of how two &#34;lovers&#34; act and react when isolated are very mature but in a childish way. This is one movie where you will never tire of watching it over and over.

B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I can't remember a film with so much good music in it since Fantasia or The Music Man -- I enjoyed it thoroughly. In addition to Maggie Smith and the other stars it was nice to see Jim Trott again -- accompanied by cornet! The Bach fit in so well in the middle of everything -- thanks Dustin Hoffman -- no one else could have put this together! -- Dick S.

B009EBLCK8|5.0|I was home with my daughter sitting in the living room and I put this show on.  I was curious if it was any good. I liked both actors work, recently watching the new movies they star in, the Hobbit and Star Trek.  My 20 yr. old daughter had her nose in her laptop, as she usually does, not paying me much attention.  By the end of the show, she was laughing and we were both really into the story.  We went on to watch all of season 1 together and she watched all of season 2 without me.  It will be forever a memory for me, that we sat in a room together on Sherlock's journey.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!

068817776X|4.0|I highly recommend. Easy reading that is hard to put down! Societal forces operating at that time period<br />are shockingly similar to what is present today in America. Scary.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great movie, and outstanding performances by the full cast. I don't know how many times I've watched this, but I never get tired of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this game cause it had such a high rating and really liked it. my husband played it and he really loved it. cant wait till there are more rooms!!!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|They tried to to a bit much, plus I'm really not a fan of Thor, so this really struck me as just ok.  There's great eye candy; lots of fights and explosions, but if you let your brain pay attention it can be hard to get through the movie.  The biggest let down was watching a movie with Samuel L Jackson in it and not ONCE did he say mother f*****.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game sooo much and I cant stop playing it. They need to upgrade some more devices on the app but surely this will blow your mind! its worth the 6.99!!! great for kindle fire.
1609611543|5.0|This should be required reading for every person.  Rather than listening to various diet 'leaders' preach that their way is the 'right' way or the 'only' way, this book just gives facts and it's the reader's choice whether all of the data presented makes a strong enough case to ditch gluten.  Most of us have/had no idea that the cause to so many varied ailments is caused by wheat products.  Truly a must-read.
0425263924|5.0|A good follow up for books 1 & 2!  Hope she keeps going with the story.  I will buy more.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Read this Trilogy thinking it was a trilogy.  Only to get to the end of the 3rd book and realize they have decided to add not one but 2 books.  Do they really think we are that stupid?!  I will not read the next 2!
0385341008|5.0|really interesting book about the islands during the war. Haven't known much about the troubles they went through  until reading this book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The character development is only second to the amazing description of scenery in this real yet fantastic world.  The story telling drew me in slowly but I was so hooked I didn't want it end!
B00452J5EG|3.0|I bought this cd when it was originally released. That copy is a bit scratched, though, and two of the songs don't play. I saw the cd listed on Amazon for $4 and got excited. But this new cd doesn't have the same sound as the cd I bought in 2005. The older disc has a sharper, more dynamic sound. I noticed it immediately. That's kind of hard to believe, so I put the new disc into the changer alongside my copy from 2005 to test. And yes, the older No Wow cd has a better sound than the newer No Wow cd. Now I know why Amazon sells it so cheap.<br /><br />Of course, No Wow is a great album, and the Kills are a great band, so I'm still giving it three stars. And if you only listen to music on your ipod, on shuffle, through little ear buds at the gym, then I guess you won't care much about the sound anyway. But is that really how you want to do it?<br /><br />Myself, I'm sorry that I bought a cd on Amazon. I should have known better, and it serves me right. I'll be keeping my eye out for an old copy to show up used at a real record store. You should do the same.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Don't want to give anything away, but the end of the last show was not what we expected....<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what happens next!! Can't wait!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie was recommended by my son. I wonder, did it make him a convert to his mother's weird belief's!!?  It is an awesome movie!! But before seeing it, I recommend you do as I did, which was to go read about what the story is about, otherwise it could be confusing to try and keep up with the characters as they play different parts in different lives.  Yes, it is about reincarnation or rebirth and the evolution of the Soul in learning or not learning life's lessons. It is like watching 5 movies in one as they go back and forth from their past lives to way into the future. The acting is brilliant!! the scene's are awesome to watch!! Blending Old World time periods with their conflicts and practices with the Matrix future!! It is so damned exciting to watch, as I laughed in some of the comedy action stories (Howard, from the Summerwine British comedies does a brilliant funny part!!; and I thought he was dead, but there he was looking the same!)  and cried at the end as the truth unfolded within these people's lives of  the evolving of their very Souls, more than any movie I have EVER wept upon seeing!! Tom Hanks and Hallie Berry were absolutely brilliant. The best acting I have ever seen from Tom Hanks as it shows how he shows up in the past life's and future characters. Because I was not sure of my actors from these makeup and costume changes, I almost wish they would have show the various character portrayals at the beginning like they did at the end. I am still confused a little as to who was who and the story line, but the watching is so great who cares!! In fact it will make you want to read the book and watch the movie again. Oh yes, it is also a Mystery Story about a musical manuscript that turns up in the different time periods following the characters involvement with it. Is it going to be saved or destroyed. You have to watch the movie to find out!!<br /><br />It is sad that we, the audience and fans of these actors don't get to actually talk to them andhave a discussion about the movie!!! Without us as the audience they would not have the ability to put out their creative offering and it is too bad it is such a one sided friendship because we do identify with these people and wonder upon seeing a movie like this if their belief's and philosophies match our own. No, we don't get to be their friends and run in their circles and vicariously get to be important too, but we do get to experience their awesome creativity and wish we were in their inner circle!! They seem to be TASK companions Souls with each other, members of a very special club.<br />  This is a long movie, so get your munchies and go to the bathroom first because you are not going to want to put it on pause and leave it for a single moment!!! I hated to even see it end as it transported me out of constant world bad news and into another time and place.......HOW EXCITING!!<br />Janie Martin
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I watched the movie before reading and loved the movie!<br />The book was interesting that it was a collection of interviews which was different from the movie, but nonetheless kept it exciting and interesting.<br />It would be cool to see a movie version of the actual book with interviews of the survivors but the movie was great! I recommend the book to experience a different perspective from the movie.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Wish there were more like this one.  It could go on and on. Can't believe it was made so long ago.  Must be getting old.  What a cast, what a set, and what a great replication of those insipid times of dressing for dinner, etiquette, and time misspent.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a very well acted and intelligent series. This series is much better than 99% of what is currently being shown.
B00650SSDU|5.0|There is something about the chemistry of these two people that I love watching.  Mila is outstanding in her role of the tough New Yorker.  Found the plot was good for this type of movie.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is all my favorite running games into one. It has action funniness and different places in it.

B002W7J3SO|5.0|North by Northwest is a film to be enjoyed over and over again, as is much of Hitchcock's work. From the first scene, the story moves as fast as its protagonist talks. Rushing from his office to a cocktail lounge, Roger O. Thornhill (ROT), fires off witty, risqu&eacute; lines to his unfazed secretary, rushing her into a cab only to rush her back to the office the very same way as he walks fast as he can to get to that waiting martini. This is a warning of sorts, from Hitchcock to the viewer: Pay close attention or you're going to miss something important. There are conspicuous individuals in the lobby watching everyone and no one in particular. ROT joins his party, but his mind is still racing, going over what he'd told his secretary. He'd made an error that needs correcting. He decides to send her a message. A bellhop trots through shouting for George Kaplan, message for Mr. George Kaplan. Just then ROT raises a finger to get the bellhop's attention. The conspicuous men zero in on ROT, mistaking him for the mysterious George Kaplan. And that, plain and simple, is what we'd call the point of no return. In the minds of the conspicuous men, ROT is George Kaplan, international spy, and they're going to take him out. ROT follows the bellhop so he can get a message to his secretary, but suddenly he's got a henchman on each elbow, shoving him into a strange car and whisking him off to a mansion outside the city. Much as some lesser filmmakers might allow the story to slow down at this point, Hitchcock does not. ROT goes from kidnapping to car chase to murder witness (mistaken for murderer) to escape on a train, where he meets the eternally lovely Eve Kendall, a woman whose words would make a lesser man blush, but not ROT, and certainly not Cary Grant. The chemistry is electric and the tight story is as engaging as every action/adventure/thriller should be. You will not be disappointed in North by Northwest.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|I thought it would not be possible to read a book on statistics that would be vaguely interesting or even funny. NOT TRUE! This book is educational, interesting and funny. There are little hooks and laughs that I'm sure Andy and the publishers put much thought in placement into the text to keep it interesting and assist the reading and learning process. I highly recommend for any PSYCH or stats topics even if it is not a recommended reading. (I bought the Kindle reader version and use it on my MacBook Pro and Android phone. Works a treat.)
B000IDEQTK|4.0|It is a very interesting movie. I thought I knew how it would end about 1/4 of the way through.  I was totally wrong.  A very good movie.  I will watch again.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm an architect and love building, even with blocks. This is addicting and fun. It's very awkward getting around and I made a lot of mistakes knocking down blocks I just put up. I didn't try the survival mode - just building. My family enjoyed the survival mode.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I do really like this app.  I wish they would add some more formatting like strikethrough and changing the fonts.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|His work is so poetic and charming. The interweaving of the characters in this novel was riveting<br />I felt like I knew the people in this book and wanted to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game but coins should not cost money some people don't have lots of money to buy them to skip or come back alive
B008458O3S|5.0|I highly recommend. Very challenging game with lots of possibilities. Took me quite a while to beat it and then it unlocked lots of bonus levels that are even more challenging. Well worth the price of a ticket to ride.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Will love this movie.  My four-year-old grandson loves this movie and has since he was two. He would want to watch it constantly over and over.  Now, my two-year-old grandson is into trains and I ordered it for him. I'm sure the reaction will be the same.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|I purchased Ocean Play Center for my nephews and neice to replace their tiny swimming pool. The product is amazing. Bright in color and fairly decent material. My neice and nephew had a blast! The BIGGEST issue I have is, I noticed the swimming pool started to deflate after being used for an hour or so. I tried looking for the air leak with soap and water but it was no where to be found. I'm very disappointed about the quality control because my niece and nephew loved this pool. Now I will be returning the item.  Click here for my video review: [...]
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun, pretty easy game that can keep your entertainment for a long time. So far it's not unfair with in-game money; some games can make it almost impossible to progress because of the slow or non existent income. I like how I can leave for a while and still make money to upgrade frequently.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it as I have the whole series! Can't wait for the next one! It leaves you wanting more and wondering where it will take you!
B005LAIHGI|4.0|THE DICTATOR, it has to be said, is an extremely funny film.  Sacha Baron Cohen has undertaken the task of attacking those demigods who consider themselves both impregnable and supreme, running their tinpot dictatorships.  He is largely successful in his task; his Aladeen comes across as incredibly narcissistic, whose philosophy is simple - execute people first, and ask questions later.  The film has him coming to the United States to address the United Nations; this gives director Larry Charles the chance to make some trenchant points about so-called 'democratic' societies which, in their way, are almost as repressive as Aladeen's.  Some of the jokes are extremely vulgar, but delivered with an &eacute;lan that renders all criticism impossible.  Ben Kingsley copes well with the thankless task of acting as Baron Cohen's foil, while Anna Faris is a feisty love-interest.  Not the most memorable comedy, perhaps, but certainly an entertaining one.
B001TH44VY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I got hooked after watching the first quarter of it in school. I watched it 4 times during a weekend once.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Just good music - very lively - happy - gives one an uplifting outlook.  I listen to it in my car just about every day.
1455523550|4.0|Safe Haven is about a woman named Katie who flees to an obscure town in North Carolina after years of suffering from the abuse of her husband. She meets a widowed man named Alex and falls in love with him and his two kids. There is just one problem; Katie is still married, and her husband is looking for her.<br /><br />Safe Haven was a pretty typical Nicholas Sparks book. There were sad parts and happy parts, and I really liked the ending. It ended as well as it good have under the circumstances.<br /><br />After reading Nicholas Sparks' memoir, I began to notice a lot of similarities between things that happen in his books and things that happened in his life. I really like that he adds such personal connections to his stories.<br /><br />If you like Nicholas Sparks books, you will like this one.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I like these kind of games and find them fairly easy when the things you need are actually there.  I have read some reviews because I was stuck now I know its because the items are not there so the game is incomplete. hope your app is better

B00555X8OA|5.0|The book is remarkably well written, insightful, and it shows exactly how ignorant are we about ourselves. I'd recommend this book to anyone that's willing and eager to be introspective.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good cast, good action, good humor.  They really don't make action comedies that are to entertaining so I'm glad I caught Red.  And I have to say I will give Red 2 a view at the theatre.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The professional reviews of \\"Electric\\" have been rhapsodic, with many naming it the best Pet Shop Boy's CD in 20 years.  That's quite possible, although Neil and Chris have simply never put out anything less than stellar.  However, I would agree that \\"Electric\\" is the most danceable, uplifting CD they've released since \\"Very.\\"  It's quite astounding in quality.<br /><br />Fans have become accustomed to waiting three or more years between new PSB studio releases, so receiving \\"Electric\\" less than a year after \\"Elysium\\" is an amazing gift.  Furthermore, the two CDs could not be more different.  Whereas \\"Elysium\\" was sublimely autumnal and focused on themes of death and endings, \\"Electric\\" is all about being young and dancing in clubs.  The lyrics of closing track \\"Vocal\\" sum it up: And everything about tonight feels right and so young/ And anything I'd want to say out loud will be sung.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" opens with \\"Axis,\\" which was released as a teaser a few months earlier.  The song is a skittering house rave that immediately announced that \\"Electric\\" was going to be a \\"dance\\" CD - a return to the boy's roots, so to speak.  \\"Bolshy\\" finds Neil Tennant demonstrating his fascination with Russia again.  Remarkably, the rather clunky term \\"bolshy\\" becomes a surprisingly poppy chorus that would have sounded perfect on \\"Very\\" or \\"Bilingual.\\"  Then we get the first of two masterpieces - \\"Love Is a Bourgeois Construct.\\"  Only PSB could create a pop song with such an oddball, pretentious title.  It's another example of putting \\"Debussy to a disco beat.\\"  In this case, they borrow from Michael Nyman's \\"Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds,\\" which itself is based on earlier classical work by Henry Purcell.  Add in lyrics that refer to acclaimed British writer David Lodge as well as Karl Marx and Tony Benn, and you have the first Pet Shop Boy's masterwork of this decade.  Next up is the dark, murky \\"Fluorescent,\\" which may be the most club-ready.  As always, though, we get arch, clever lyrics, including rhyming \\"mark\\" and \\"oligarch.\\"<br /><br />The CD takes a slight dip during the next three songs, starting with \\"Inside a Dream.\\"  The song is good - everything here is quite excellent - but it's simply less memorable than the rest of the CD.  The same can be said for \\"Shouting in the Evening,\\" which is a slice of PSB dubstep.  \\"The Last to Die\\" is a solid, romping version of a Bruce Springsteen album track.  In Springsteen's version, the lyrics seem to be about the Iraq war, but when Neil sings \\"Who'll be the last to die for a mistake,\\" one has to wonder whether it could also be about AIDS.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" concludes with two of its strongest tracks.  \\"Thursday\\" is about starting the weekend early - on Thurday - and continuing the party through to the end of the week (\\"I wanna know you're gonna stay for the weekend\\").  The song (notoriously) includes an interlude by British rapper, Example; I was concerned that the song would sound gimmicky as a result, but it's an incredibly catchy, slinky song...the second `masterpiece' on \\"Electric.\\"  Example actually adds nicely to the mix; of course, Pet Shop Boys have been 'rapping' since \\"West End Girls,\\" so we needn't have worried.  Finally, we get \\"Vocal,\\" which is the heart of the CD and really summarizes what the whole proceeding has been about - connecting to music (\\"This is my kind of music...I like the singer/he's lonely and strange.\\").<br /><br />Throughout the CD, producer Stuart Price gives the music a modern, sleek feel.  Yet everything still sounds indisputably 'Pet Shop Boys,' which is probably why they have been able to maintain a fanbase all these years.  There's absolutely nobody else like them making music.  \\"Electric\\" is a near perfect dance CD by the perfectly perfect Pet Shop Boys.et arch, clever lyrics, including rhyming \\"mark\\" and \\"oligarch.\\"<br /><br />The CD takes a slight dip during the next three songs, starting with \\"Inside a Dream.\\"  The song is good - everything here is quite excellent - but it's simply less memorable than the rest of the CD.

B0090SI4LU|2.0|I can't believe this is the same story as that of the book.  I own the paper version, the digital version, and the audio version, and it's one of my favorites.  I bought this so that my husband could watch it with me.  He looked at me like I'd gone off my meds, and I nearly fell asleep.  I want the two hours of my life back!
1607066017|5.0|This is a very good story. I enjoy everything about it. I did not purchase the Amazon version, i was in a comic book store and picked it up as well as the sequel. The story picks up well and the art work matches the mood and basically what all the characters are saying--sounds cheesy, but everything falls together nicely.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something fresh and I can almost guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Great artwork, interesting story and amazing characters.
1401235425|5.0|Even though DC rebooted, it still feels like the Batman we grew up with. This book has many twists and turns that keep you wanting more. If have not picked this book up, what are you waiting for? Pick it up today.

B0052AC8C6|2.0|We found the plot of this movie to progress very slowly. There were a couple of moments of enjoyment, but for the most part, our family kept wondering why we were spending our time watching it. Our children are 17 and 12, but typically enjoy animated movies. This one just wasn't for us.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|If you are a Dexter fan, this is a complete change of pace plot line compared to the other seasons. Can not waiting for the final season and to see what happens. Plus the extra premiere episode of Showtimes new series Ray Donovan is included as an extra.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Interesting, considering Captain Sullenberger of US Airways making an emergency landing in the Hudson River. What went on in that cockpit?
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I'm a bit abashed that this teen is having sex with a guy just to have sex in the series. No relationship. The entire story and plot is so sad and vain (mother has fake boobs, gives terrible advice, daughter is opposite, daughter doesn't even try to look pretty...and she really could) I am discouraged after I watch it and want to go to bed. (Some would probably take the plot as funny, but not me.)  I kept watching more episodes in the hope that she would get a makeover or start dating her f--buddy. NOPE. Typical high school story but a bit more racy than the rest. I would not recommend and won't be watching if seasons progress.

B000FC146C|5.0|Read this book many years ago and was so wrapped up in the story, was so disappointed when it ended. They made a mini-series out of it and it was good, but never as good as the book.  Too much gets left out.  Got this for my kindle and reread book again in just a few days. Loved it all over again. Love the characters.  I will reread this a few more times I'm sure.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|You either like or do not like the movie.  came in great condition.  I love the movie. I bought the movies one by one, mostly because I do not need all the extra stuff.  I like the movie and that is it.
B0050VA428|5.0|The return of Sherlock Holmes in this novel gave ample opportunity for Conan Doyle to skewer his most famous literary creation while giving his fans just what they were hounding him to write. Holmes, from the outset is much more arrogant than usual and much more condescending towards John Watson than normal. He doesn't even enter into the story for about a third of the narrative. It's really Watson who tracks down the clues. Holmes swoops in at theend to wrap up the case. But did Holmes get it right? As soon as I finished this, I dove into another book: Sherlock Holmes was Wrong by Pierre Bayard in which the author meticulously analyzes Holmes' behavior in HotB, proving that Holmes really blew it this time. Conan Doyle cleverly leads the pipe smoking detective completely down he wrong path. In the end, when Watson questions Holmes' conclusions, the Baker Street sleuth cannot really explain himself. Read this one again. You may find Sherlock's mistake!

0142420891|5.0|Where She Went left me an emotional wreck. I laughed, I cried, I got angry and wanted to throw the book across the room (not the best idea because I was currently enjoying this novel on my e-reader). I haven't felt this way about a book in a long time... Well, not since I finished If I Stay. I highly recommend this book if you're looking for a real story, one that will keep you up at night because you are so captivated by the author's magnificent story weaving.<br /><br />This book took my breath away.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, with easy to use interface.  works on kindle fire. Enjoying levels so far. If you like puzzles to unwind from a stressful day, this has the cure.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great book. Couldn't put it down!!!<br />Looking forward to the movie and how it compares. Can't wait to read the next two!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is sure to prove to be controversial. The historical Jesus that Reza Aslan presents in this book is far different from the Biblical Jesus. But in the beginning of the book he says he is a Christian, and he actually presents a Jesus that is pretty great.<br /><br />Mr. Aslan was absolutely meticulous in his research for this book, too. 20 years in the making, with a notes section that goes through and explains exactly where things came from, and goes into yet more detail on things. This book was just as meticulous as his research, but thoroughly readable. And extremely fascinating.<br /><br />Mr. Aslan made Jesus and his times come to life in a way that has never happened for me before. I will definitely reread this book, because I definitely do not feel like I assimilated all of the great information the first time around. There is just so much to this book...it is great.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this for conservative Christians. It is, perhaps, too controversial for them, because the historical Jesus is not the Jesus of the Bible. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to discover a dynamic, revolutionary, history-based Jesus. But I definitely do recommend reading this book. It is truly a well-written, well-researched book.<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own, and I am never compensated for my reviews.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This kept me occupied for hours! And I recommended it to all my friends. You get lots of puzzles without even checking out what's at the store.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitively an interesting game. Makes you think out of the box. Like someone else said, it is challenging but not so much so that it is frustrating. It challenges your wits and your memory. Can't wait for new levels to be added. Please make it soon.

B005LAIH2M|5.0|If you go into this movie looking for something serious and Oscar-worthy, you're going to be disappointed. If you go into it looking to check your brain at the door and spend a couple hours having some gory fun, then you'll love it. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do great as the brother/sister duo who have used their childhood trauma to fuel their adult career of witch-hunting. When they come to town looking to find some missing children, they find out that things aren't as they think they are, and awesomeness ensues.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. Look, I am not a teenager therefore I am out of target. The movie was on Sunday night. I bought it in the morning and finish reading in the afternoon, just in time to watch the movie. English is not my native language which makes my reading \\"slow\\". I've had to look several words on the dictionary lol what made my reading \\"slower\\" lol.<br /><br />BUT I JUST COULDN'T STOP READING.<br /><br />The book is well written. The narrative is dynamic! The plot is interesting although the idea is not entirely new. The characters are so \\"alive\\" that you can easily relate to them. You can feel their pain and their misery.<br /><br />You can't forget them easily.<br /><br />Katniss is a survival and her personality is a lot like mine. I loved her.<br /><br />The only point is that I've expected her to be more of a fighter. Physically speaking. Somebody that even being small, could use the fists. First surviving law when you are small. Just an idea. Not enough to be disappointed.<br /><br />This book is very entertaining and I'm buying the continuation today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series does a nice job introducing the BDSM lifestyle. Only issue I had was that CG enters the lifestyle because of a history of abuse, and the book touches on how cathartic the lifestyle is, but readers could be left with the feeling that BDSM is for broken people.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|\\"No lord but God\\" echoes as still relevant among religious radicals, or reactionaries. That was the Zealot party's battle cry. An Iranian immigrant, Reza Aslan as a new Californian briefly left behind his Shia heritage for a teen stint as a born-again Christian. Now a professor of religion at UC Riverside, and long interested in ecumenical as well as jihadist studies, Aslan freshly times his lively look at Jesus. He mixes scholarship with social media; as a Muslim and a CEO of a studio covering Middle Eastern issues and the diaspora, he shows awareness of how to package a very familiar subject in attention-getting ways.<br /><br />N.B.: If you come to this review ready to attack Aslan before reading the book or my last paragraph, kindly reconsider, as this careful study deserves a patient reading; my already long review elides much. I emphasize that that nearly a third of Zealot is endnoted; Aslan, a UCSB Ph.D. in the sociology of religion, has done his homework in two decades of meticulous investigation. Here's my summation.<br /><br />At least since Ernest Renan sparked controversy with his 1863 life trying to make Jesus more human by making him less Jewish, so as to be more \\"Aryan\\" Christian, learned biographers seek to understand a Jesus making sense to today's rational, contextual, and text-based mindset. The \\"higher criticism\\" of the mid-19th century popularized (more in seminars than seminaries) this. Aslan emphasizes a rebel alongside the two \\"thieves\\" really assassin-revolutionaries (\\"lestai\\") crucified: a trio condemned for resisting the Roman empire and its Jewish collaborators. Reminding us that the Sicarii were \\"daggermen,\\" he places Jesus within a cabal closer to today's insurgents in this same region than with honey-voiced peacemakers, or wistful redeemers with flowing locks and fair or dark eyes that follow you across a room. What follows is my paraphrasing of Aslan's brisk re-reading.<br /><br />While this version of the Son of God as warrior has been preceded by liberation theology with a Galilean upstart rallying peasants and workers to an uprising, Aslan in presenting a vibrant, tense depiction for today appears to want to wake us up out of complacency, vividly. His appended annotations support his interpretation but this scholarship is subtle, to opt for verve. For instance, the narrative proper starts not with a manger scene or Annunciation, but a well-paced informative depiction of the Temple, ending with the assassination of High Priest Jonathan in 56 CE by a zealot.<br /><br />The Zealot Party did not exist until a generation after the death of Jesus; Aslan after taking us forward to show their revolt and defeat (Masada as the last stand) moves backwards then (not sure why this provides the book's structure, but he keeps this often-told tale quite entertaining, precise, and provocative, certainly its best feature) to the Gospel narratives. He cautions readers who expect the historical Jesus to match the mythic Christ; he explains the backdating of all new testaments about Jesus functioning as an heroic tale so that even those in the know or closer to the real events that may have supported the Church's revisionism would understand. As these Christian scriptures are not meant as eyewitness accounts but fulfillment of prophetic \\"truth,\\" this literary activity makes whatever can be extracted out of the accounts (and those which fill in the story outside the canon) tendentious. Rather than cherry-pick chapter and verse (although I suppose any biographer of Jesus or biblical critic may fall into this occupational hazard), Aslan strives to frame his arguments 'in situ.' (Again, I anticipate disputes may arise from those who do not ponder his endnotes within their own context, or recite rote objections or quibbles without the academic training of Aslan and colleagues.)<br /><br />He tries admirably for an accessible prose style, not to mention keeping his narrative free of academic contention, while integrating many ancient sources smoothly and modern scholarship tacitly. Aslan argues for a \\"Fourth Philosophy\\" (i.e., after Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes) zealot-friendly Jesus. \\"Give back\\" what is Caesar's by linguistic study becomes the telling phrase, and this is not \\"render unto\\" the imperial powers in submission by the downtrodden Jewish nation, but a defiant in your face sort of response to that tricky question. As a defiant Jew, Jesus is shown as telling his disciples in guarded analogies and curious parables his messianic \\"secret\\" when he would rule his homeland, for these \\"aspirations\\" persist as the \\"singular fact\\" that led to his crucifixion, with \\"The King of the Jews\\" posted above him not as a taunt but as was Roman custom, the reason for his conviction.<br /><br />The Kingdom of God challenged the Temple authorities. He detested the scribes as well as moneychangers; quislings like Caiaphas in league with Pilate (revealed as a ruthless ruler, not the hesitant caricature) represent the Caesar whose imposition of taxes and servitude rankles Jesus and his careful group of chosen apostles. He asks them who people say he is but cautions them to keep quiet. Aslan interprets this as subterfuge until Jesus can come to Jerusalem to take on his opponents. Until then, as an \\"itinerant exorcist and miracle worker,\\" the real difference of this purported carpenter (that steady line of work is so doubtful in mud-brick Nazareth it's likely apprentice Jesus and his brothers had to labor to rebuild the resort city of Sepphoris): he offered his magic for free.<br /><br />Rather than a \\"utopian fantasy,\\" the Kingdom of God \\"vindicates the poor and oppressed. It is a chilling new reality in which God's wrath rains down upon the rich, the strong, and the powerful.\\" While some parse turning the other cheek or loving one's enemies as assurances of pacifism, Aslan rejects this. He reminds readers (unlike Renan's work) that Jesus is a Jew, and has the back of his own people, as any faithful Jew would in occupied Palestine as in defeated Judea or ancient Israel. \\"He understood what every other claimant to the mantle of the messiah understood: God's sovereignty could not be established except through force.\\" John the Baptist and other rebels set this in motion.<br /><br />The curious title \\"the Son of Man\\" Aslan shows as part of the necessary secret. Jesus promotes this as a sort of overt identity to cover the messianic title that his followers bestow upon him. \\"This man is the messiah\\" as confirmed by early hearers of his message betrays the tension: this equates (in my phrasing) to a deadly terrorist threat today spoken against those in charge. Sedition=death.<br /><br />Novelistic touches, as in the high priest's assassination or the prayers in Gethsemane, reveal Aslan's talent for enlivening with careful detail the greatest story ever told over and over for two millennia. Why Jesus when arrested stays largely silent seems logical: three years of a ministry bent \\"on destruction of the present order and the removal of every single person who stands now in judgement of him\\" speaks for itself. Aslan reasons that later Christians glossed over much of the radical context he extracts as to the rebellious nature of Jesus as fractious Jew before he was elevated to Christ for all Gentiles. If you remain curious as to how the passages he must select have been judged by scholars as more trustworthy than others, this appears embedded in his appended research but submerged in the main body of narrative. (I have an e-galley proof to rely on; at 70% Aslan's afterword and annotated endnotes begin, to document his range of scholarship, nearly a third of the entire text under review.)<br /><br />He does often show how \\"patently fictitious\\" certain iconic sections are. As with the \\"trial\\" offered by Pilate to the rabble, often Mark and later writers (aimed at certain audiences) distance themselves safely from any sympathy with the rebels in the wake of the destruction of Herod's Temple. Such back-dating must always remain foremost in mind by any educated reader of the Christian scriptures.<br /><br />This revision for non-Jewish readers meant the Gospels had to be sanitized of \\"revolutionary zeal\\": Jesus had to be recast (in each succeeding gospel in more outlandish form) as peacemaker and the Romans as free of what now the Jews were given full blame for: his death. Caiaphas proves the heavy; Pilate plays his pawn. In \\"passion narratives,\\" for \\"liturgical purposes,\\" a ritual sequence of events arises that early Christians can re-enact. The end is a given: Jesus as crucified messiah. Aslan strips accretions off and looks at the crucifixion for sedition, but then jumps ahead to the first martyr.<br /><br />Stephen, as imagined soon after Jesus' death, learns his resurrection is attested as confirmation of him as the messiah. But this does not jibe with Judaism, \\"awaiting a messiah who triumphs and lives.\\" Yet, as Stephen does not live in Jerusalem, is not a scribe or scholar, and so does not know the prophecies that Jesus' followers reinterpret, Aslan figures \\"he was the perfect audience\\" for a new pitch \\"being peddled by a group of illiterate ecstatics whose certainty in their message was matched only by the passion with which they preached it.\\" 33-35 CE, Acts reimagines Jesus' trial (while repeatedly misappropriating Jewish scripture) as Stephen's speech to his persecutors before he is commemorated as the first one to die for his savior. He makes the speech recasting the resurrected, messianic \\"god-man\\" in otherworldly, apolitical fashion: blasphemy to the Jews. Then the stones fly.<br /><br />For Aslan, this marks the end of the historical Jesus and the start of the Christian cult: Jesus as God.  Nobody who knew Jesus (don't trust names titling Bible books) wrote anything. Illiterate apostles, while Jesus' family waits for his return, hunkered down rather than evangelize as Paul did: this limited who defined Jesus' message. Greek-speaking Jews and then non-Jews in the diaspora wanted not a \\"revolutionary zealot\\" but \\"a Romanized demigod\\" who preferred to stay celestial.

Whatever scholars say, providing this very readable and engaging set of reflections on Jesus, his times, and his impact, Aslan deserves an attentive audience willing to reject tendentious Sunday school tales, for a rigorous study.truction of Herod's Temple. Such back-dating must always remain foremost in mind by any educated reader of the Christian scriptures.<br /><br />This revision for non-Jewish readers meant the Gospels had to be sanitized of \\"revolutionary zeal\\": Jesus had to be recast (in each succeeding gospel in more outlandish form) as peacemaker and the Romans as free of what now the Jews were given full blame for: his death. Caiaphas proves the heavy; Pilate plays his pawn. In \\"passion narratives,\\" for \\"liturgical purposes,\\" a ritual sequence of events arises that early Christians can re-enact. The end is a given: Jesus as crucified messiah. Aslan strips accretions off and looks at the crucifixion for sedition, but then jumps ahead to the first martyr.<br /><br />Stephen, as imagined soon after Jesus' death, learns his resurrection is attested as confirmation of him as the messiah. But this does not jibe with Judaism, \\"awaiting a messiah who triumphs and lives.\\" Yet, as Stephen does not live in Jerusalem, is not a scribe or scholar, and so does not know the prophecies that Jesus' followers reinterpret, Aslan figures \\"he was the perfect audience\\" for a new pitch \\"being peddled by a group of illiterate ecstatics whose certainty in their message was matched only by the passion with which they preached it.\\" 33-35 CE, Acts reimagines Jesus' trial (while repeatedly misappropriating Jewish scripture) as Stephen's speech to his persecutors before he is commemorated as the first one to die for his savior. He makes the speech recasting the resurrected, messianic \\"god-man\\" in otherworldly, apolitical fashion: blasphemy to the Jews. Then the stones fly.<br /><br />For Aslan, this marks the end of the historical Jesus and the start of the Christian cult: Jesus as God.  Nobody who knew Jesus (don't trust names titling Bible books) wrote anything. Illiterate apostles, while Jesus' family waits for his return, hunkered down rather than evangelize as Paul did: this limited who defined Jesus' message. Greek-speaking Jews and then non-Jews in the diaspora wanted not a \\"revolutionary zealot\\" but \\"a Romanized demigod\\" who preferred to stay celestial.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was hard to put down and I dreaded finishing it because I didn't want it to end. I was scared the ending would ruin the whole book, but there wasn't much of an ending. The book seems unfinished. The chapters at the end where very short and briefly described. The bigger picture is painted throughout the small micro-interviews that Brooks has created. These brief descriptions of characters are often too brief, especially at the end, but there are some terrific moments in the beginning and the end.<br /><br />There is definitely room for improvement and for another account of the war from the world of Mr. Brooks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's hard to stop watching it.  It has great characters and story lines.  All of the seasons are equally good.
0876391277|5.0|I've never been one for making sound effects with my horn, but this book really got me inspired. There's pretty much no sound effect that's not covered here, and the author does an awesome job of explaining precisely how to get each effect. Learning all of these sound effects has definitely enhanced my sonic palette as a saxophonist and has also improved my tone, since many of these involve working muscles in both the inner and outer embouchure. Highly recommend this one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We have been watching the Suits series back-to-back!  They are great!  You just want to keep watching, one after the other!  Ha!  You may want to make sure you have a free weekend 'csuse once you start, you'll be hooked!
B00BESM14U|3.0|The movie is good, if you have never read the book. I just prefer the book a lot better. There are moments that the movie could have captured better. In general, not bad at all though. Definitely recommend it, but read it first.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Amusing game. Great graphics and pretty backgrounds make it a pleasure to play. My only complaint is the timer.  otherwise, it's fine.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsay has a wonderful blend of fantastic violin and a modern twist in the background music.  The result gives upbeat or relaxing music good for any mood. If you have time check out her music videos as well,  the cinematography pairs beautifully with the music.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Definitely better than the first but not quite there. It should have random monsters come out of nowhere that you have to dodge and there should be more abilities.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I had recommendations from friends to watch this and it was  definitely worth it. The right balance of comedy, mystery and Sci fi with a hint of family values thrown in.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|The guy is so head and shoulders above the rest of the field.........Bosch as he ages just gets better and better. Nothing better than setting by the pool in the sun with a Connelly/Bosch in hand.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read nothing about this book. If you're a science fiction fan, just buy it. The way Howey reveals information piece by piece will have you anxious to know more. He excels at plotting and his characters drive this novel. Don't miss it.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|What a great mystery! I was stumped as to Who Dun It until the end of the book. This is the first Agatha Christie novel I have ever read but definitely not the last. This is a very quick and easy read but intelligently written. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good old-fashioned mystery.  Well done, Mrs. Christie.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was definitely not what I expected. I love how funny the characters are in the first half. That's definitely one of the things that hooked me to this book. Yes, I agree with some of the other reviews about the sexual abuse. At some points it was a little too much but nonetheless it was a good read. The story is so well written. I wouldn't change a thing! This was my first Colleen Hoover book and now I can't wait to read the rest of her work!

B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love this series. I can't wait for number four. I read the first three to fast. Jeffrey Archer keeps you engaged in the story throughout.
B009KHCT94|5.0|This movie is hilarious. It's fun, good looking, and has a dark sense of humor that is sorely missing in most modern comedies. When you consider that a movie looking this good was made for less than the Avengers spent on their catering budget it puts some of Hollywood's excess in perspective. It's at least worth a watch.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie. It's funny and yet sweet. I love Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson!  Had to buy the soundtrack because I couldn't get enough of some of the songs.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Dumb me! Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb me! All summer I put my faith and hope in the big blockbuster films, the Iron Man 3's and Star Treks of the world. And from Man of Steel to Pacific Rim almost without fail these over budgeted, underwritten explosiony action films left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Except for World War Z there is not a single movie I've seen this summer that I can truly say was a great film. Some were better than others (Oblivion and Pacific Rim were both pretty good) but considering their competition was Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness that's not saying much. All the while I put off seeing Monsters U for weeks. \\"It looks silly\\" I said, \\"Pixar has lost its mojo\\" the idiot side of my brain insisted. Well, that sure teaches me. I will never doubt Pixar again. Even if they make another mediocre film like Brave, they have more than proven themselves still capable of making a damn good film.<br /><br />Wall E will always be my favorite Pixar film, and Toy Story 2 will always be my second, but fighting for third place for a long time has been Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, the original Toy Story, and Up. That is the kind of company Monsters U is keeping. It does everything right, from delivering plenty incredibly funny moments balanced with the kind of emotionally powerful and heartfelt scenes that have made Pixar a household name. This movie is so funny I chocked on my popcorn. I haven't laughed this hard in a movie since 21 Jump Street. And it wasn't that cheap appeal to the lowest denominator type humor either. There aren't any fart jokes, poop jokes, inside innuendos about sex or drugs. None of that nonsense here. This is good old fashioned honest to God comedy that's drop dead hilariousness and perfectly appropriate for all ages. When you hear kids laughing in the theaters along me, a 24 year old man, you know its comedy gold. It's because the characters carry the story, and when you have a story driven by strong characters you have a good film. Mike and Sully aren't the only ones delivering laughs, as just about everyone gets in on the action.<br /><br />Mike and Sully, much like in the original film, star as the main roles but their relationship isn't quite the same. They start the film as heated rivals: Mike is an underdog overachiever who's devoted his entire life to becoming a scarer despite the fact that he's not even remotely scary, while Sully is the son of a famous scarer who's had everything in life handed to him and makes no effort whatsoever in applying himself. Sully has all the natural skill in the world but none of the motivation or drive to apply himself. Mike on the other hand lacks any sort of natural skill. He isn't scary, he's built like a lovable beach ball, he can't roar, but his drive and motivation makes him able to compete with some of the best scarers on campus. It's very Rudy like in that regard, and though not entirely original the way the story is told is Pixar magic at its finest. And like Rudy it teaches us a very valuable lesson that people of all ages can relate to, that despite ones physical limitations, even of those limitations preclude you from achieving something you've wanted your entire life, with enough hard work, dedication, and the right attitude you can very well succeed at what you wanted, even if it's not quite in the way you imagined. Who can't relate to that? Who here wanted to be an athlete when they grew up but didn't have the physical capability to compete past High School? : raises hand: As adults we've all experienced this at one time or another. You wanted to be an actor, an athlete, a musician, something, but despite your hard work and dedication it was just never meant to be. So I sympathize with Mike, as I imagine most audience members will.<br /><br />At the other end of the spectrum we have Sully, who presents a cool and collected face to the world but is living with the weight of high expectations. His father is a world class scarer, a legend, and so Sully has a lot to live up to. His pedigree makes him blind to his own limitations and the need for improvement while also placing a burden upon him he's terrified of not living up to. He's brash, arrogant, a know it all, but as time goes on and failures pile on top of failures he learns that pedigree is not enough, that without actual effort your natural skills won't mean much of anything. Life won't give you a pass because you are the son of so and so or because you can roar really loud. Eventually you're going to be put to the test, and forced to compete against those of equal or greater natural ability. When that happens it's the ones that apply themselves the most who will succeed. It was great to see Sully's development in this way from hot shot know it all to humble and hardworking individual. I'm telling you there is more depth, growth, and subtlety to these characters then all the summer action films combined. It's not even close.<br /><br />The animation in this film is the best CGI I've ever seen. For the scenes set in our world I would have to remind myself this was an animated movie. There is a scene when Mike and Sully are sitting by a lake with the moon hovering over them that looks like it could have been shot live action. It's that amazing. If not for the cartoon monsters I might not have been able to tell the difference. This applies to the very well made short, The Blue Umbrella that kicks the movie off. Pixar has always been a pioneer for animation but this is their best, more realistic work yet.<br /><br />Monsters U is nothing short of a masterpiece. If this were any other studio I'd present this film as their masterpiece, but along with Japanese Studio Ghibli I don't think any studio has such a consistent level of success with almost every film they make. It's merely one of many dozens of fantastic movies by an amazing studio that deserves to be seen. If you've not seen it yet, make a point to do so. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Replay value: High.s scarer, a legend, and so Sully has a lot to live up to.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie based on the extraordinary performance of &#34;A&#34; list actors, crew, and historical relevance. The movie starts a bit slow, but is needed to set the stage for the historical events to unfold. I would recommend purchasing the movie for academic reference or personal interest.

If you can appreciate an amazing female voice you will not go wrong with Dido. Thank you!

159463176X|4.0|I was quite eager to read this and devoured it in a couple of sittings, however, when I finished the book, it did not have the same lingering effect as Khaled Hosseini's other novels.<br />The heart of the story is about a brother and sister separated, but I found the theme here to be more about parents and how relationships evolve as all parties grow older.<br />The beginning of the novel began with the same poetic prose that Hosseini fans are familiar with, but as the book went on, I felt that some of the writing was clipped, possibly hurried. There were chapters that I felt were left too open-ended when the story was over.<br />Other than these few critiques, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will continue to read Mr. Hosseini's books.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I liked the book for the most part. It is interesting and the story takes place in the future.  However, I felt towards the end the book dragged on.

B00AR3WD8W|5.0|It's hard to explain how \\"Aloha From Hawaii\\" was such a big deal back in the day as it truly was a huge event: The King of Rock N Roll giving a live concert transmitted by satellite to 40 countries around the globe for free.  For those who couldn't see Elvis in concert here was a chance for him to perform in your living room.  No expense was spared and the budget for the show was a staggering $2.5 Million USD, the most expensive concert at the time.  And talk about high risk/high reward; if there was a problem with the satellite feed it might all be for naught.  A huge amount of work went into setting this concert up and they actually recorded the rehearsal (now released as the [[ASIN:B00BLB6Q6O Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite / Alternate Aloha]]) which could be shown in the event there was a problem. There had been complaints about how lackluster Elvis's shows were becoming and the producer Marty Pasetta came up with a fairly novel idea to extend part of the stage out into the audience so Elvis could get closer to the audience.  Elvis also saw fit to drop 25 pounds of weight so he would look much slimmer to viewers and in honest he probably hadn't looked and sounded this good since his 1968 Comeback Special.  His [[ASIN:B00136Q0U4 Elvis As Recorded Live at Madison Square Garden]] released a little more than a year earlier showed that Elvis was no oldies act serving up just his hits, but his newer songs and inimitable covers of other then-current hits made famous by other artists.<br /><br />There's a tendency today to diminish and demean Elvis's performances in the 1970s as the nadir of his career, that he was hopelessly drug addled, propped up vocally by his backup singers, and gradually declining to his eventual death.  But if you listen to this you quickly become aware this is an artist who was still at his peak and enjoying performing rather than seeing it as a chore or performing it by rote.  If anything Colonel Tom Parker is to fault for that perception as for some reason he delighted in releasing recordings of Elvis at his worst not only while Elvis was still alive, but after his death.  The opening of \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" should get longtime fans pumped and for new fans it's a great introduction.  The band plays as though they have nothing left to lose and it sounds way punchier and livelier than the aforementioned [[ASIN:B00136Q0U4 Elvis As Recorded Live at Madison Square Garden]].  Clearly Elvis is having the time of his life here, mixing up new songs and his hits from the 1950s, starting off with his electrifying signature cover of Ma Rainey's \\"See See Rider\\" and launching right into his recent hit \\"Burning Love.\\"  Elvis is pretty much ripping the roof off the Honolulu International Center right out of the gate!  From there Elvis serves up a tasty gumbo of his reinterpretations of then-current pop songs and the occasional oldie.  His versions of \\"Something\\", \\"Steamroller Blues\\", and \\"My Way\\"  are breathtaking, showing that he wasn't not an oldies act but still relevant and current.  Elvis serves up an eclectic mix of oldies and more current songs and aside from the sequined jumpsuits, showmanship, and age difference there really isn't a whole lot that separated him from Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby in that era.  All three served up a mix of their own hits and reinterpretations of then-current pop songs.  The set list is quite different from the aforementioned [[ASIN:B00136Q0U4 Elvis As Recorded Live at Madison Square Garden]] album and clearly Elvis enjoyed toying with the set lists, keeping concert goers wondering what songs he would play and to my mind that's a bit astonishing; Elvis clearly could have done a show that showcased only his hits and not songs that others had made famous, yet he's willing to take that risk.  But Elvis was very much \\"in the moment\\" and clearly didn't want to dwell on or in the past.  Elvis was very much aware of the disposeability of pop music and sought to stay current, which was part of his enduring success.  Other artists from the 1950s wound up frozen in amber, doing oldies shows but not Elvis!  Certainly folks could have walked away from his show complaining that they wished he'd have done more of his classic songs but after Elvis rocked the house this hard I doubt anyone walked away complaining.  \\"Aloha from Hawaii\\" is how I'll always remember Elvis. This was on in our home and I was captivated and enthralled by Elvis's performance.  He was absolutely mesmerizing in ways that precious few performers are. I remember Mom playing the double album we got of the concert and it was like reliving it all over again.  Deciding to make the performance in quadraphonic recording paid huge benefits as the sound here is astonishingly good...far better than most live recordings of the era!

Other artists from the 1950s wound up frozen in amber, doing oldies shows but not Elvis!  Certainly folks could have walked away from his show complaining that they wished he'd have done more of his classic songs but after Elvis rocked the house this hard I doubt anyone walked away complaining.  \\"Aloha from Hawaii\\" is how I'll always remember Elvis. This was on in our home and I was captivated and enthralled by Elvis's performance.  He was absolutely mesmerizing in ways that precious few performers are. I remember Mom playing the double album we got of the concert and it was like reliving it all over again.  Deciding to make the performance in quadraphonic recording paid huge benefits as the sound here is astonishingly good...far better than most live recordings of the era!

B0008ENICU|5.0|The Women, as shown by many reviews here, seems to spotlight the supporting cast as much as the heroine Mary Haines (Norma Shearer); however, the story itself is about Mary and her ideas, ideals, her and relationship with her husband.  Mary's problem is her husband has been \\"snagged\\" by a good looking and clever shopgirl who is playing around with her husband behind her back (Joan Crawford).  As Mary is good the shopgirl is evil and has her sights on the money and not the man.  But that isn't the key to Mary's problems - her friends seem to be.  These friends are an element of the story that is often concentrated on by viewers and reviewers, but they are really not the key to the story.  Mary is the key element that drives and controls the events.  It is her ideals that men have no right to stray from the promises of marriage (no one has in Mary's mind) that thrusts the story forward.  If he (the husband) isn't honest and trustworthy what good is it being married to him?<br /><br />The Women actually revolves around that idea.  Is marriage worth having if a partner isn't going to be faithful?  Then comes a very complex answer.  Maybe the man, or anyone, can stumble and still be worth having.  IF he doesn't love the girl he has dallied with, and IF the wife is truly his one love, and IF he isn't going to wander again, IF the children love him, IF he will love and respect the needs of the children, et al,  THEN he might be worth keeping.  This answer comes in part from the mother of Mary Haines who has suffered some setbacks herself.  Mary's child is an additional complication.  As Mary struggles with this question - is a marriage worth saving once a  partner has slept with another - among varying answers from her friends, she almost turns into a female Job with her friends doing her a lot more harm than good most of the time.<br /><br />After a good deal of suffering Mary reaches her conclusion about her particular husband.  Meanwhile, many of her advice giving friends are blind sided by divorce and unfaithful partners themselves.  At the end of the movie, just like an MGM movie always delivers, the good prosper and the evil suffer.  But the gut busting comedy covers up a truth that the playwright Luce brings out throughout the script, is sex the foundation of marriage?  With women around that can and will seduce a man in an instant - men being infinitely susceptible in this arena according to Luce - do the evil win the man and the battle of marriage?  Is the time spent at the spa to stay in shape really what marriage is all about?  Stay in shape and keep your man?  One woman who is terribly out of shape and pops kids every year seems to have the best marriage of all.  But that marriage takes a back seat to the marriages of the other women.  She is an afterthought in the play, a kind of comic interlude.  Or is she?  Remember, Mary isn't as good looking as her competitor and unlike the others she has a child.  So... does the kid popping friend have a joke of a marriage or the perfect marriage?  She is the point of many a joke from the others, but maybe the joke is on the good looking friends who gossip their way to nothingness while buying expensive fashions and exercising to maintain their stunning figures.<br /><br />Mary, through the incredible acting of Norma Shearer, manages to fight through the false idea that marriage is sex and beauty, and through the idea that marriage must be perfect.  Luce actually poses a straightforward set of questions with extremely complex answers set in a comedy theme.  This isn't a movie or a play about feminism.  Anyone \\"seeing\\" this in Luce's play is looking for political correctness in the wrong place.  Luce is going much deeper than feminism here.  She is digging to the heart of the matter of marriage and the eternal commitment of men to women and the problems that that particular idea brings.  It is also, most decidedly, NOT a period piece.  Saying this is a period piece is deeply demeaning to the clarity Luce presented in exploring lasting questions of human relationships.  Greek tragedies are not period pieces and neither is The Women.<br /><br />You can watch the movie for comedy alone and come away quite satisfied; however, if you want to exercise your brain and really watch the story and the people you will be blasted by the truth Luce seeks and the complex answers she comes away with.<br /><br />AD2g to the clarity Luce presented in exploring lasting questions of human relationships.

B00C4XYEBW|5.0|My husband loved it!!!! Huge Judas  Priest fan so this was a great find, Part of his Happy Fathers Day this year!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Bought this VD for my daughter. It was exactly what we expected. A lot of the great songs from the movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse performed great and the build quality feels more like a $100 gaming mouse.  However there are 2 things that bothers me.  Maybe it is just me.<br /><br />(1) I am used to having 2 buttons on the left side thumb buttons instead of 3.  Having 3 over there throw me off as in which are the 2 forward & backward button no matter which one I setup for.  The extra 1 button there really throw me off.<br />(2) The extra programmable button in front of the wheel scroller kind of pushed the wheel scroller back a little too much. I feel like I need to changed my entire hand position back a little on the mouse to be able to use the middle wheel scroller right.  I think that programable button could of been smaller so that the wheel scroller button can be higher up closer to the finger tip.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great performance mouse all together especially for the price you pay for.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Always loved Roald Dahl's writing because of his ability to use wickedly &#34;grown up&#34; humor in what are essentially children's stories. This was never more true than in &#34;Matilda.&#34; I read it in about an hour and a half on the train from Edinburgh to London and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|If you want to kill some time...this is the movie for you. It was too predictable and boring at times. The premise was very good and the acting was strong. However, it is not worth your time or money. Go take a nap instead...you'll be better off.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|All the stories by this team are great but the ones about Special Agent Penergas will keep ypu on the edge of ypur seats and you will be praying there will be another one soon. Starting from book one written by these  guts you will be searching for the next one . Each is good but when starting from the beginning of Pentergasts search for Justice and later his dead wifes killers will not let you sleep
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|....then this game is similar.....in that there are cute apes in scrapes who need your help having fun! Vibrant backdrops and silly  reactions from chimps made this game an addictive time waster for me.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George Martin is a writer of great prepositions  his descriptions of people and places are never boring but lets you see the things he describes like you are there.  His story's are exciting and sad, with unexpected spots of humor.  This series is a mixture for the mystery addict. the horror lover and the adventurer. although then story is fiction even the historian in us will go for it and enjoy what might have been. Start from the beginning to enjoy the whole adventure. When you start be ready to become a captive audience
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is a great complete package with all 6 movie discs and 3 extras, all packaged in a (cardboard) book that fits into a cover sleeve. The whole saga with it's 9 discs takes up the same amount of room as about 2 to 2 1/2 regular DVD's! The only down side to this is that they are copy-protected so they will not play in a computer - which was the whole reason we got them to begin with - so my son could watch them over and over (like most little kids do) without subjecting mom and dad to the monotony of watching them again and again!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved this book as I did the first two and all the rest. It will captivate you through all of the adventure he lays before you  i recommend it to all who love mystery ,adventure and have the time to be held captive by this tale of castles,kings, rogues and Hero's
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Dr Who has been a favorite since I was a youngster in England.  I'm happy to see the quality is still excellent as expected.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|You never know what is coming next - unpredictable and fun. We really enjoy this show and look forward to the rest of this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game<br />it is better than temple run and subway surfer combined<br />it has a couple of cool costumes and powerups throughout the game<br />it is the best value ever for this game<br />it is great on the kindle fire.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is very entertaining!  Screen plays are well written and develop characters well. This season starts to get you involved with people you may have previously disliked. Watch it!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's okay, but it gets boring doing basically the same stuff over and over. The graphics are nice.<br />Maybe if we didn't have to wait so long between missions.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome but I think you should be able to do something other than the flying part other than that it's an awesome game I think you should get it
B000P5FH3K|1.0|I thought this was awful compared to the book, the judge was wrong and yes matt damon was wrong. he was like &#34; get me thru this movie...&#34;  I was not impressed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not like the other games by similar name. This one is really fun to play, makes you think. Can't wait for more levels, 10 was not enough.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I have already seen this movie...twice as a matter of fact, but ordered it to give as a gift and one for myself to watch it again another time. It is a rare one! I will watch it over and over.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Monster life is the best game I've played plus the monsters  are adorable!!!!! Anyways I have one suggestion though can you make more of the monsters worth coins?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great story! Very appropriate to today`s current events. I highly recommend this book. It is a must read. Exciting to the end.
B009FTAH3W|4.0|This is the second time I am reading this good book and this time with my kindle its even better
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun fast paced and addictive game. Great way to waste some time while you're resting. Better pay attention or you'll send the wrong  color ball.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Moajang you need to put flint and steal in creative ok love Mc so Much and add<br />Game mode 0 1 2 please next update
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Excellent book - it taste like Heinlein and I love it. Thank God there are more books in the serie
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I give this 1 star because it is a dictionary. I would be tempted to use an app instead of this book.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Fantastic tale from the unknown. It is almost a to much to take in and it is unbelievable that we just let this happens in North Korea
B005DD7TI0|3.0|I liked the structure, starting in the middle and then quickly flashing back to the beginning to show us how we arrived there, and then going beyond that moment. However, I think that what the character and the script do with what is essentially a magical gift is not terribly creative or interesting.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book exceeded all of my expectations. Instead of just telling me the heroine was smart, she showed me. The characters have life and personality and their own voices. I laughed so hard at several different points, and then I was reading with my heart in my throat, rapidly turning the pages as if reading a thriller - I had to know what would happen.<br /><br />This story sparkles with intelligence, wit, and yet still has a sensitive heart. It is the book I've been wanting to read but unable to find for a long time.<br /><br />I recommend it if you liked the wit of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series and the raw healing and emotional resonance that can be found in Laura Kinsale's work. This book has heart-pounding attraction but it also has the transformative power of actual love and unexpected depths of real friendship. It is not to be missed and I am looking forward to reading more from Courtney Milan. <3
B003L7DK74|5.0|Great comedy, funny story lines, funny and original music... Dry and literal style humor. Love this stuff. Glad they quit after season 2 though, good to quit while they were ahead. Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show! I am so glad that I can still find tv shows that I am not having to turn off because of &#34;mature content&#34; or foul language!
B008133MDK|5.0|Loved it! Now I have to wait so long for Season 3 to be out! Great new interpretation of a classic and amazing cast to boot.
B00003OSU4|5.0|This is really interesting.  Want to watch it again.  Anita O'Day is the star of the show.  Very artistic direction.
B002NVELDQ|5.0|I never got to see the first 5 seasons of Mad Men. This has been soo enlightening and educational. It is always fun to find out how things got to where they are. And all from Amazon. Thanks Sandie
B005LAIHRC|5.0|It was the best musical ever.  It was so funny.  It's a must see.  An all star cast of people messing around have having so much fun, that you can't help to have fun watching them.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this because it is full of action<br />And  fast paced events. I also like that they are sort of simmilar  I love catching fire.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love the back up and listen feature. Inventive internet stations from all over the world playing anything from soup to nuts. Fun to explore!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was not as good for me as the first two were. I wanted Katniss to end up with Gale & Peers to . End up with that other girl from 12 (I think her name was Delly??)
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I really enjoy John William's music, so much so that I loaded it on my car CD so I can listen to it anytime..
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I bought this movie for my ten year old daughter, Sierra.  However, after watching it it's become a favorite OF MINE AND HERS!  Unlike many of her others, this movie really fascinates..IT IS NEVER DULL..ALWAYS MOVING!!  I love the narrative inside the zombie's head; and he is cute!  The movie at times reminds me of Edward Scissorhands and at other times the classic The Time Machine.  Yet, it also as an originality that makes it it's own.  I recommend you see this gem for yourself. Underneath everything that lies deep messages and I think the more you dig the deeper they become.  This movie stayed with me after it was over.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|A great heroine movie!! A movie for us girls and women alike to  stand up for what we believe in ourseleves..  Whether its right, wrong, or indifferent.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|It is not my practice to do surveys of any kind.  I only do this review because Amazon requires it.  Product works as stated in the description.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|it's great to see stars and constellations, but it doesn't move to specific areas of the sky. Just shows where you are. i am looking for an app that acts more like a telescope and focuses where I hold it.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|My teenage boys and I thought it was great, loads of fun.. even made the pop-corn an beer tast better, for me, not the kids....
B009NY43NY|4.0|I like the book but I did expect more from the ending.  I would suggest that if you like the series, read it.
B004RL9T50|4.0|It was alright, I mean the kids stopped talking long enough to hear the ending, but it's not what I would consider a late night, go to sleep type movie....
B00CWV8X04|3.0|The movie was okay and I would recommend for someone to watch.  I don't want to say too much since I might give away the plot.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|When a movie can hold the attention of 7 thru 10 year old's, you know u got em where u want em, the other surprise was that all the adults in the house were, after about the first 10 min's, watching with open months, and mumbling ok... ok..
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game! I was looking for something that everyone who uses my kindle could play and this is perfect.

B001NAT05W|1.0|Halle Berry must have owed a favor to someone to have made this movie. I don't know which was worse, the movies horrible soundtrack or Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt's acting! Equally as bad I believe. This was probably one of the cheesiest movies I've seen in a long time! Heck, the original Batman TV show was better! For all of the bad acting, they could've brought back Julie Newmar!
B005C5SJ1U|4.0|This story of two brothers- one who always does well until traume in Afganistan and the other a neverdowell who straightens himelf out and helps out the family in tough times transitions to a psychological drama dealing withy the elder brother's torment related to hyis actions during the war.  Well done and impactful
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book takes the reader into two worlds, the flowers and their message yes, but also we also get to feel and see the life of a rebellious and wounded orphan.  In these two stories, intertwined like the past and present the author reveals, we  sense the healing nature of life.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It starts slow and to some extent, I was wondering where it was leading.  But then the movie takes a turn and really got my attention.  It left me feeling really satisfied that this was a movie well spent time watching!

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Isn't incrediably stupid that I can't just give my stars and leave it at that?? What can of moron makes one have to write about something? Is this lower intelligence that had taken control of the machine? Oris simply a really, really group of people that sat in a board room trying to come with ways to justified their highly inflated saleries? Living in this new world of the Internet and reviews, what good are they, really, someone dribbles on and on about how this show or that song has changed their life?? I don't think so. . . . Think of it this way, the punks have taken control and we suffer! If anyone feels the same start written stumped and insane reviews like I have -- rebell against the machine!! That some like a good name for a band. . . BTW, I really like the show, which should have clear by my 5 stars!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game!  keeps me interested for hours.  I can not expand fast enough.  I can not wait to play the second one.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|Parts of this movie are really great, but some things were overworked, becoming difficult for the little ones to maintain interest.

B0068THAGY|5.0|Watched with grandchildren, and we all enjoyed this movie immensely. Characters were well-defined, and easy to identify with. The action was steady, and there were no dull moments throughout the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love the minion`s well this game is totally for you. But you have you have to have a fast finger or you will have to pay with your money to help him so if you like spending your money well this is your game.

This book was an excellent read, so very well written that you felt it was the first time you had heard the story. A must for history buffs and fans of the greatest men ever.

B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is honestly one of the Best mobile games I've ever played. I can't see a time when I'll stop playing this game. Awesome story, epic boss fights, and satisfying victories. Can't get much better than Kingdom Rush.
0439023513|3.0|The last of the Hunger Games trilogy is a bit of a mixed bag.  The first 80-90% is filled with action and excitement.  What will happen?  Who will win?  Finally you get to the last part and it's full of dreary and depressing parts one right after another.  The ending really left me a bit hollow affecting my perception of all three.  I'm not saying everything should be all rainbows and roses at the end but that was just too much for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This variety of games keeps you and everyone in your home busy.  My granddaughter and I had a blast competing against each other.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|From the opening triumphant instrumental \\"Axis\\", it is obvious that UK duo Pet Shop Boys have retrieved their dancing shoes and released a stomping album reminiscent of their earlier days, especially coming on the heels of the rather drab and somber \\"Elysium\\". The fact that this is their first album away from Parlophone which was their home for almost 30 years may be a factor in their rejuvenation. Produced by Stuart Price and comprising just 9 tracks, everything is upbeat and lengthy, and quite a few songs sound like they could be remixes, similar to \\"Introspective\\" or their \\"Disco\\" series of albums.<br /><br />\\"Bolshy\\" recalls House-tinged numbers like \\"Left To My Own Devices\\". The dizzying \\"Love Is A Bourgeois Construct\\" has a propulsive feel and a male choir; \\"Surbubia\\" meets \\"Go West\\". The incandescent \\"Fluorescent\\" tells the moody tale of a jet-setting celebrity. \\"Inside A Dream\\" is hypnotic with dreamy synth-string breaks.<br /><br />\\"The Last To Die\\" is a Bruce Springsteen cover (it appeared on The Boss' \\"Magic\\" album) and sets dreamy harmonies and synths to a stomping beat, magnifying the anthemic nature of the chorus. It sounds a bit like The Killers. \\"Shouting In The Evening\\" is reminiscent of \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad\\", fractured almost Dub step with melodic breaks. \\"Thursday\\" features a cameo by rapper Example and features one of their spoken/sung deliveries a la \\"West End Girls\\", it is even similarly paced.<br /><br />Closing is the deliriously catchy House anthem \\"Vocal\\" which starts off deceptively laid back before stabbing synths and beats kick in, (much like \\"It's Alright\\") with lyrics telling of the power of music. It's like the eighties all over again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|GREAT APP FOR EVERYONE. WHO EVER COMES UP WITH THESE APPS MUST BE RICH AND HAD A LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT AS A KID. ALSO, THEY MUST LIKE DESPICABLE ME A LOT.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and think its really fun. I like how it gets increasingly faster the higher your score. Its good having characters that you can work towards as it makes the game alot more interesting.
B003730LRY|4.0|Fun movie with many strange and weird characters. But none of them are reallly scary. Just very, very unusual. Fun for the familoy.

B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Great book series. Bought it for my husband and he is working on finishing his other series he is reading right now.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Cool plot, the same familiar cast of characters, an interesting doomsday scenario that sigma saves the day, yet again. Highly recommended
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Unfortunately, I can't review this as I ordered it for my daughter who hasn't received them yet.  They arrived at my PO three days ago and I've mailed them to her.  She is looking forward to watching them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun! Great to play against your friends. Have everyone in my family addicted already! Plays better on phone than kindle though
B00BHWG5SG|5.0|This man just keeps getting better w/ age and this release &#34;Live at Legends&#34;  is no exception, for he will go down as one of the greatest blues player's to have ever lived!. As will some others of course, such as Cole train, BB King, Clapton, and list goes on. Yet this man will always be in my personal top (5) of the &#34;GREATEST&#34;.<br /><br />I would suggest that you buy the limited edition &#34;Multi-colored, Limited Edition (2) LP set!. For besides sounding wonderful it's really cool looking and will only go up in value. &#34;If you're into that kind of thing&#34;
B003YL4LYI|5.0|No. 5 in the series is a real step-up and Martin displays his very best.<br />However just as so many characters were missed in number 4, those in the preceding novel were missed here.  Not a great choice to split as he chose to so I hope Martin does not do so again.<br /> Unlike many 'series' novels, this one absolutely only works in the greater picture,<br />Still, GAME fans will love it.  Looking forward to number 6 and picking up where this (and no. 4) left off.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have a realms account and i never get to use it.  After I log in I stare at the screen for about two minutes and all it does is flicker the word loading
B006CDCWDM|5.0|THIS USED BOOK IS LIKE BRAND NEW. IT IS SUCH A BARGAIN. I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING<br />ABLE TO ORDER A BOOK SO REASONABLE PRICED.
B005IU1OMA|4.0|It is one of the best movies about snowboarding I've seen . The shots are spectacular, very good music, photography is unmatched and scenarios are simply amazing and beautiful. I recommend it even to people who do not practice winter sports ... is very exciting and at least you can enjoy the scenery.<br /><br />Bonus on the disk are good and the story is simple but well told.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I love these sprawling hyperlink movies involving many characters and story lines. It's more about great themes and struggles we face in life than it is about plot details. That is why we have so many questions about it, because the characters understand their lives to be real and urgent and they are unconcerned with explaining things to us in the usual ways that characters do but real people never do.<br /><br />That made me enjoy the movie on a deeper level: it isn't about the facts of the case at hand, it is about underlying human struggle.<br /><br />It's often times operatic and sweeping in nature, it contains several courageous and effective performances, and is as thoughtful a character drama as it is an adventurous space odyssey. One of the very best of 2012, and a movie that I think will broaden its appeal the more people find it and stream it.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Very frustrating at times, but a truly unique story. Left me smiling in the end! Also, it was legitimately scary!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Typical for Hosseini, there's a lot of story here and interesting characters. But I don't think it's his best work.  Too much &#34;fluff&#34; to pad the book that really had no relevance to advancing the story.  That annoys me--like the editor was asleep on the job or the author needed a longer book.  Otherwise, an engaging tale that serves to humanize people from a part of the world that is culturally so foreign from ours.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great App for horse lovers. So much fun and nice graphics!  Almost like having a real horse! Really enjoying this SIM.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I needed a GPS puck to work with Windows 8 for a charting application.  This one does and worked right out of the box.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|How come Jet Li gets his name placed so high in the credits?  He is gone early in the movie.  Nice to see Chuck Norris shooting bad guys again!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It was awesomely exceptionally good and vary fun I would suggest if you like subway surfer and temple run you'll just love iron mans 3
B000SW2F8K|3.0|I thought the &#34;magic&#34; or whatever you call it was hokey.  I just could not see her character getting back with her cheating husband just by cooking something.  Weird.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Great graphics, great concept, great fun. My whole family (6 years old to adults) loves it. Would recommend to anyone of any age.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I thought the movie moved along quite well.  I do not know if the movie is a proper adaptation to the comics.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fantastic app. Graphics are great and no glitches. Needs to update for kindle as often as it updates for android and needs to allow users to sign in from one device to another, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. Also, when you get to the higher levels the training criteria should match the competition criteria.
B008602KQI|1.0|I have not read the book.  I did not go to the theater to see it.  I was not impressed.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I cancelled before i played it. I play Random Marjogg first and like it  so well  I just cancelled the Deluxe because I did not want two games of marjogg.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book reminded me a lot of the movie \\"Before and After\\" initially.  The end was wrapped up a little too quickly.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It is not fun for me. maybe my stradegy is off but I don't like it. They don't fall right, Like I said maybe it is my playing. I don't get enough play from this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game for my puzzle loving daughter but ended up completing all ten levels in this version after putting her to bed the first night. Just know you'll be hooked but loving it.
1419703692|5.0|First I'll admit to just loving all the insights on behind-the-scenes found on DVDs, so this was just a fantastic amount of information.<br /><br />The book follows a great logical flow from beginning to end; starting with initial conception of Batman Begins to the final sound editing of the Dark Knight Rises. Great pictures and captions.<br /><br />The best thing about the book is: you will learn about the approach that Christopher Nolan takes to his films. Soon you'll understand why not just TDK trilogy, but all his films have an incredible feel to them, a uniqueness that other films lack. This book should also serve as a guide on &#34;how to make movies the right way.&#34; Nolan does thing unorthodox in the movie industry and it shows in the final product.<br /><br />I dare you to read this book and NOT want to watch Batman Begins, the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises back-to-back-to-back.
1449410243|5.0|Love this book. Cat lovers beware!  Great Christmas gift for cat lovers. Check out the methods of death in the last chapter.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|No longer limited to playing on PS3 so I don't monopolize the TV. Great graphics, nice upgrade from 2012. I missed '13.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and it's just like subway surfers which I liked but not more than this despicable me minion rush I love it so much I can die by just playing on it can you believe this come on.
0802473156|5.0|After 2 small kids, my husband and I disconnected. Our counselor recommended this book and boy did it save our marriage. We found things we never knew about eachother after taking the quiz in the back of the book and we were able to key in on eachothers top 2 love languages. We have never felt so in love. I now give this book as gifts for any and every occasion. I'm THAT weirdo lol
B00594XOZU|5.0|When I first got this app I was having a blast texting my friends, but about a month ago this strange guy started texting me. My friend said he was texting her too. Right then my friend and I where very scared. A couple weeks later I was fiddling around with my phone and found that i could block them! I automatically told my friend the great news. My friend and I were so happy. And from that day forward we never got a single text from that strange man again. My point is that if there is some strange guy or girl some how got your name you can just block them. I hope you all found this helpful. Oh and I know this is random but if you ever want to text me on kik my username is: soccercatten.  :)
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is the best free app I have ever had I love it just if it had a sketch to design your own profile picture
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This is not a game to wreak a mend because you have to start all over every day!<br />DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Super easy read. You can read the whole book in a day in one sitting. Definitely a classic...but one has to wonder how Dorothy didn't end up in a mental institution! As young as she was seeing heads being chopped off and all.<br /><br />Not super entertaining but something everyone should read. Great lessons on courage, love, never giving up, friendship, etc.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|A most download for any kind of gamer. Really addictive game. Couldn't be more happier with it. Can't wait for the sequel
B002RI9B9O|4.0|I loved the book. Was nothing like the movie.  Has interesting plot.  I have been on an 18th century kick and this book fit right in.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a good game people get it<br />Edited java skids ask six skids did Chua skids<br />Fans skids show welcome wood Chua and Dirk
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Easy to install. Puts my Kindle in sleep mode when you close it which has been handy. Very durable. Would like interior pockets.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Best free game I have found although it is like the rest and more fun if you spend actual money. But it allows you to continue anyhow just takes alot longer to accomplish things in the game.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book!!! The writing style makes it a nice simple read, and the story introduces you to world that sucks you in and makes you sad to leave when the book is over..,,I am so glad that Cassandra Clare is writing more books about shadowhunters!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Guys this game is awsome wonce you started playing it next minute youre Attracted to the game guys im telling you you need to get this game :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought that this game wad very fun and very addictive to play. I enjoyed it very much and I will continue to play this.
1781162646|4.0|Excellent summer vacation read! This isn't a horror novel - it's suspense, a good ghost story, a good love story, all rolled into one.  I read it in a day because I had to find out what happened next.  Great characters, a sense that this could have happened to anyone, suspenseful plot.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|to much supernatural things in it, it was kind of weird..The story line was okay, but I liked the twilight series better.
B00AW57L96|5.0|How easy is it to draw the wrong conclusion about a situation? Some twists that make the book interesting. Great bedtime reading.
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|I purchased this ebook as a requirement for a class.  It was an enjoyable and easy read that is relavent for many professions.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Good story.  A little too long for my liking.  The characters were good, but not well developed.  I would have liked to know more about Lee.
B0027ZGPDC|1.0|this movie constitutes major distortion of real life, particularly in japanese/american values and behavior.  My opinion is, don't bother with it.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Brought back memories of my good friends and school.  Definitely a classic that I will enjoy watching over and over again!

0375842209|5.0|Well written, very moving. Surprised it's considered a \\"teen\\" book, though, as I think it's too complex for many teen readers.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Want more of Henry and his eyes!  My husband and I watch this in the evening after the kids go to bed and we both love it!
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|Great graphics, nice sounds. However this game just felt very boring. I played it for about an hour hoping it would get better. Didn't...
0007466064|5.0|And it came on time. Thank you! Great book, btw. The whole series it totally fantastic. I would recommend to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game. I &#34;beat it&#34; a couple times, but they always have more and more challenges that for some reason never seem to get old. Very entertaining. 5 stars easily.
B006S086AM|3.0|Kinda boring. Way too emo!  Twilight but take out the glittery vampires and insert dorky maladjusted 20 year-olds that still live with their mommies.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Fun little app for kids. Very mesmerizing. Allows you to create beautiful designs and patterns with the touch of your finger. No need to be an expert. Anyone can create with this.

0802473156|5.0|Really enjoyed the book.  We are also using it as a guide for a class we are holding.  The clients are loving the information and using it to understand themselves and others.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Every season continues to build on the story of 2 brothers who help fight against Supernatural forces and save the world. Great mix of horror and emotion. Every season is great and should be in your collection. All seasons are in mine.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|fun game at first but after about the 140 level there was<br />no more object to the game--it gave you so many coins you couldn't use them all
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series from Jeffrey Archer.  I got the first one from the library (Only Time Will Tell), the second one a friend gave me (The Sins of the Father) and this one I purchased for my Kindle (Best Kept Secret).  This book ended in a cliffhanger............my only complaint, having to wait for the next book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just a great book and great read! I always wanted to keep reading and never stop. It was that good!
B007MDB548|5.0|This is a very good movie, and the 3d is great. We do not have kids at home any more and saw another of these movies on netflix. Surprisingly good. My wife and I were very pleased with this movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a pretty cool game if you like searching for items kind of game. It passes the time away.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Just the same as other Angry Birds with just a Star Wars theme tune added to it to make it different from others - disappointed really think there should be more thought put into it!
B003N7ORNI|4.0|A great book with exquisite twists I love the Kane chronicles the serpents shadow was good but the red pyramid just a great book
B001FB55I0|4.0|great movie different from the rest, not better than treminator 1 and 2 but a good stand alone movie worth checking out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like games then get this one it's free and fun !!! And if you like this you should like temple run this game has been a great entertainment for me  it has a lot of views and I can tell you that this game is great for a  free game  you should get it and get temple run!!!!!
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Saw him on Darryl Hall's show and absolutely had to get his CD.  Wonderful music, reminiscent of Smokey Robinson-type music.  Extremely satisfied and would highly recommend.  Great experience as always with Amazon in terms of packaging and receiving item in a timely manner.

0618001905|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is in advanced academics classes and she picked this book as one of 3 books to read this summer. Once she got it she didn't think she would like it but that soon changed after she read the first chapter.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Although the game itself is OK, dealing with the advertisements every time a new game is started was too much for me. Ended up deleting it from my Kindle.
B000025U89|5.0|Mr. Hancock is a genious.<br />He makes you feel his music.<br />Like Miles, you can play this music in the background doing anything, or listening intentionally it's outstanding.<br />I hear so much in this albums phrases and solos; other jazz artist and hip hop artist owe a great debt to Herbie Hancock.<br />It's great to follow the root paths of the Miles Davis tree.  But Herbie Hancock is a tree all his own.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Accurate forecast and great graphics. It works!!! Use accuweather for forecast, easy to use, great software for your kindle. Buy it now.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|It is a fun game.  Not enough levels...went through the game in less than 45 minutes with a couple of breaks included.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, very addictive.It starts easy, and progress as you go along. Can't wait for more games. Great game!!!!!!!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|In Blu-Ray, Surround DTS-HD Master w/ Dolby PLIIx sound:  Beautiful! Creative! Amazing! Great Great Great Surround Sound! Visual Art at it's highest level.  Thank you Cirque Du Soleil!!
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Bravo to the Producers for Keeping The BASIC story line but taking out MUCH of the Campiness. This is a TRUE HORROR FLICK!!<br /><br />I am a fan of both the original and the new version.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars which is rare for me to give anything because I judged it based on How Good of a Horror flick it was. Not by COMPARING it to others or the original. No one can compare to the original.  It is a CULT CLASSIC. This is its own film!<br /><br />Please if you watch this try not to judge it based on the original. If you do you may be dissapointed.<br /><br />But I was NOT at all dissapointed.<br /><br />This too is a classic and will be remembered.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was mainly just looking for a digital horse to play around with, but this is also a very fun game that I would recommend to anyone. :)
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album and Ferry Corsten are constantly playing in my car.  The album is just fantastically done and I hope they can put together a movie for the tracks like Interstellar 5555.
0670026557|5.0|How often each day are you taking from others without reciprocating? Or, are you in constant mode of giving help 24/7? Adam Grant's brilliant new book called Give and Take is an exceptional well researched book outlining the way that being a giver can influence your life. Like Youngme Moon, Dan Ariely and Daniel Pink, this is another important marketing thought leader with some great insights.<br /><br />Grant describes three types of people. Givers, Takers and those in between that he calls Matchers.<br /><br />The givers are those who are always helping others to connect, to get information and to mentor. They aren't looking for anything in return but believe that this is how they want to be in the world.  When a giver meets someone new, she tries to find a way to help expand the new acquaintances' network. Without asking for something in return, she selfishly gives her time.<br /><br />The takers are those at the other extreme who want to get something from others to help themselves. They aren't looking for reciprocity but are only looking out for themselves. Takers tend to have big networks too but in part they are often burning bridges and need to keep finding new connections. They live in a `leaky bucket' kind of world. They are only in it for themselves. Their interest is singular - what can you do for me?<br /><br />In the middle are these matchers who I like to describe as the Quid Pro Quos- you do this for me and I'll do that for you. Matchers say, \\"I can help you connect with this important person but in return, what can you do for me?\\" They see the world as an exchange of favors and need to even out the giving and taking.<br /><br />SURPRISING RESULTS<br />Givers tend to be over represented at the bottom of the pack in many industries according to Grant. By bottom of the pack he means in terms of their successful careers. But his findings also show that givers also are over represented at the top too. It seems that givers can find themselves so absorb with helping others all the time that they don't act in their own short term benefit. However, in the long run they tend to be the ones who people come back to with opportunities. Givers benefit the most in the long term.<br /><br />The book is rich with research and real world examples like Frank Lloyd Wright, Jonas Salk and even an accounting professor at UNC and Duke named CJ Skender who has successfully taught over 35,000 students. One of my favorite stories is about what Grant calls powerless communications which has to do with humility as a tool for being heard.<br /><br />To learn more about the book and Grant who teaches at my alma mater, check out his video on YouTube about his thesis. Very entertaining.<br /><br />MARKETING STRATEGIES TODAY<br />What intrigued me about the book was thinking about the marketing profession and how important being a giver is today in the social media world. If you aren't putting out 25 gifts to your community (on Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and other social media sites) versus the 1 ask that you make, you may be acting against your best interest. Giving and being generous is a marketing strategy that most successful marketing professionals I know follow. Those at the top of their game tend to intuitively know that freely giving is the best default setting.<br /><br />Try this little experiment this month:<br /><br />Track how often someone asks for a favor and keep track of your response. Do you act without asking for something in return or are you just purely giving? Monitor what you do online if it's a give or a take or somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />How often do you ask followers to do something for you versus doing something for them like provide interesting articles, links or podcasts.<br /><br />Identify coworkers who fit into one of these two categories and observe their behavior and how they act when requests come to them.<br /><br />Are you a giver, a taker or a matcher?<br /><br />About me: I write about unraveling marketing strategies at my blog called MomentSlater.blogspot.com  Check it out.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I don't like action movies at all, but I liked this because it was funny and witty and had all the right actors.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome, I love it so much! It would be more enjoyable if I had more friends to play with and everything didn't take so long. But it's awesome!
0375714839|5.0|Including the \\"story of a childhood\\" and a \\"story of a return\\", this compilation is one of those essential graphic novels everyone should read.<br /><br />This autobiographical story of Marjane Satrapi is powerful, but there is something more overwhelming than the personal story of that girl turned to teenager...because that is the story of millions of girls, boys, teenagers, women and men living through dire difficulties, in harsh and violent regimes and through the fear of war.<br /><br />This is also a story of an outsider, of a young woman that is an alien everywhere. Here we can also watch/read in the first person the plight of the immigrant and of the returnee.<br /><br />With grace and strength, the girl turns into a woman. She makes many mistakes, but she always has the courage and the drive to move forward. This is truly a story worth knowing.<br /><br />The simplicity of the drawings directs all emotions to the eyes; the black and white panels are also extremely effective. This is a masterpiece.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|This was a great movie about a family affected by the 2004 Tsunami!  Have wanted to see a movie about this terrible tragedy and this is the first!  Keeps you on  the edge of your seat and the movie was rightly named The Impossible!  Commands your attention all the way through.  Well acted!  Highly recommend this movie and it is a true story!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found it to be an interesting read.  I enjoyed reading the experience a man of science had and his descriptions of his experience.
0140067477|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful in explaining &#34;The Way&#34;. Among other things it gives an excellent and simple understanding of the three teachings of China. The three masters written about were Confucius, Buddha and Lao-tse, author of the oldest existing book of Taoism. The author uses the characters out of Winnie-the-Pooh to demonstrate the three teachings with the emphasis on Taoism which may produce the best opportunity to achieve harmony with all life while honoring all life. It is a hidden introduction to the ECK, the LIght and Sound of God.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series was amazing.  Wasnt sure how I would like it after 50 shades but turns out that I think it might be a little better.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|No redeaming value.  Laugh out loud's were no-existant.  Attempt to add bad guy turned good was sloppy.  I can't forgive myself for watching this from beginning to end.  Thank goodness for Prime because it didn't cost me anything (like a movie ticket).
B004QOB8SO|4.0|I still like season 1 better,this was a good season overall..only bad thing about it was trying to make Sherlock seem dead at the end to fool the bad guy..which..is realy crazy and someone should bump him off....please let there be a season 3...paul
B003EVWDR0|4.0|I liked the movie.  I did not like that it did not have closed caption.  (I like closed captions)<br />I recommend the movie. Will watch many times. It had the flavor of spirituality, universal laws, and religion.<br />On my computer, I did not like that it took several hours to download.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is an item where the Amazon word count requirement is a bit silly. It is a cord and it works just as it is supposed to.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent! There is so much information. You can put your location in to the app as well as other locations and compare the weather. Great when going on vacation. Up to date. I use it everyday....
B004UJAOLM|4.0|This is a truly classic book filled with well-developed and relatable characters who go through trials that would test even the strongest of men and women.<br />  It provides lessons on the values of love against advantage; Heaven against Perdition; family against familiarity; wealth against need; and even life against the peace of death.<br />  Anyone who wishes an engaging read should try this classic novel from Emily<br />Brontë.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Mind challenging. Makes you work your brain & eyes to find all the numbers. Makes you study the picture to find all the hidden locations.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Movie to be seen as many time as possible, very good movie and a must to had in a collection,thumb up!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|good movie to watch with the kids!! the kids loved it as well!!!! that all i have to say about that!!!
B005IT0V8O|5.0|Every writer should have this book at his or her fingertips at all times when writing or editing. The clear Gold Standard. Well written and easy to find stuff in. Remarkable how much longevity the advice has.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Super cool game! Really makes you use your brain, so you can't really space it and play as much as I do when finding the birds, but I love it, really different.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Amazing suspense- it kept us on the edge. I can't wait for the volume 3. Wonderful cast - enjoy ;-)
B008XG1X18|3.0|Cool but you can't pick picture s from your library to put on your boards. You have to take them in the pinterest program, not through your camera. Super annoying. But cool to space and browse through when your bored...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this style of game. Just enough of a challenge without being impossible too complete. Can' t beat free too!  Highly recommend this game :-)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It starts of easy and does give your brain a challenge..every now and then...as you go from room to room or floor to floor...enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|On install the Kindle app attempts to open, then simply says 'Kindle Application is closing' - I haven't yet figured out how to uninstall and retry and the current version appears to be broken.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|A very good game to pass time. Good visuals and effects. Keep running away. Would love to get more free stuff rather than buying them.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Maximum PC said it, and now I'm saying it. This CPU cooler not only keeps my intel cool and happy, but it air conditions the 3 foot radius area around the computer. Granted, my corsair case has two intake fans, but the exhaust spits out colder air than my small room fan I use at night. Not only is it the best CPU cooler for the money, but the best air cooling CPU fan you can buy.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|A quite simple and well made game. The difficulty level is not gradual . But can pass hours on it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game I just wish it wouldn't glitch and force close on me otherwise I'd rate this game a 5 star. Also it would be nice if we could earn more diamonds without<br />spending real money
B0063IH60K|3.0|The Classic desktop game now on the Kindle. Love playing it anywhere anytime. Have not tried to unlock paid contents .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so muscular fun I could play it all day orbit could if ur donating on getting this app don't just get its awesome
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had some time of simple fun. Had some times when I had to put down and come back. Can't wait for the update
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It has been awhile since I last played MTG. Playing MTG with actual cards can get pricy. Buying boosters to get that one rare card you need to build your dream deck or buying the card from a trader can drain your wallet.<br />After I spent the price to unlock the full version of Magic 2014 I do not need to spend any more money to fully enjoy the game. There are of course in game items to purchase if you want, But just playing the game allows you to unlock new decks to play with. You will need the decks you unlock during campaign mode to duel new enemies.<br />The tutorial does a good job explaining the game mechanics, And the game itself has several ways to play and can be challenging.<br />SirArtos
B00CDT41RY|2.0|A lot of over acting and not believable. Jamie Fox was great but that was about all that was good about this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|great book, missed it in high school, glad I picked it up when I did definitely worth reading especially before the movie comes out!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is literally the best game ever!! Thank you Mojang! I know its $7 but it's worth the money. I love this game!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Not quite the follow up I was expecting but it was still a great read and plenty of Ender to make it worth it
1469259273|5.0|This is book two in the series and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />It continues with the same force and page turning interest that &#34;The name of the wind&#34; created.<br /><br />It is a fun read that will hold your interest all the way through.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Entertaining and thought provoking.  Brings up topics that are rarely discussed.  Well written.<br />Need a graphic organizer to keep the characters straight.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon sent me this because the adaptor that came with the Kindle stopped working. Charges super fast! Customer service great!
B00BESM14U|4.0|An 80's coming-of-age movie made for 2013 - quirky characters, good acting, solid plot...enjoyed it a lot and recommend it.
B009CGLO3K|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this film. It is somewhat cliche but the imagery and acting are quite good even if the script is lacking at points. A solid, action fantasy drama that probably won't leave you emotionally affected but is enjoyable to watch.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I found the beginning chapters to be slow, and not as engaging as I expected.  Once Ms. Fey began telling more of her later teen years and on into adulthood, the story began to pick up and find it's rhythm.  Reading about the many challenges of writing for a number 1 rated ensemble show, then creating her own show to write, produce and act in made the rest of the book simply fly by.  Overall, I found the much more entertaining remainder of the book more than made up for the less than sterling start.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game started and was running fine but when I tried to get out of the game it wouldn't let me out. I had to restart my kindle twice to get out of the game. I am not sure why it works great for others but horrid for me?
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|All of the original Star Trek movies in one slim box set - excellent.  Great quality video; a real bargain.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun app, the only downside is that the weird dog isn't in this. TeeeeHeeeee. I need more words. Yeah.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app allows me to stay in touch with bids while away from my main computer.  I LOVE IT!!!!!<br />THANKS ebay
B0070DOHQS|3.0|Works great with Samsung Galaxy S3 and Windows 7. Does not work correctly with Windows 8. If it's not free than pass.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie before reading and wasn't going to read the book. I was convinced and glad that I was. This book was addictive and created a more vivid picture of events. I highly recommend this book.
B0008237BY|5.0|Tupac is the greatest rapper ever and this album is one of his most reflective and intellectually deep albums!<br />Must buy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|At first (before I started playing) I thought that this game was not gonna be that great but then came the first time I tried it and I wouldn't stop playing \\"it's so fun\\".<br />I love the game and hopefully when other people try playing they will it love to!!!  I recommend to get this game (a lot) !!!!!!!!!!
B0019N94X6|5.0|Blu Ray Limited Edition: Astounding clarity. Great audio. Unlike the old DVD/VHS copies, with the Blu Ray, you feel like you are literally on the set. The extra contents are an added bonus for a Scarface fan.<br />The Movie: One of the best gangster/mobster flicks of all time.<br /><br />Excellent buy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the few books that deserves all the hype it gets. If you're debating whether to read it or not...then debate no further, this is a must-read.
0811879542|5.0|The children in my class absolutely love this book. Its fun, interactive, develops reasoning skills, memory, recall and prediction skills. Lots of laughs and giggles, guessing and class participation.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I loved that this book was a mystery. And like all John Green books, it really makes you think about life in a different way.
B000SZH8LQ|5.0|This whole entire album is fantastic.  My daughter and I love it! It's a great album and is full of fun.
B009HBN62C|5.0|I bought this book due to seeing the movie, &#34;The Nun's Story&#34; starring Audrey Hepburn recently on DVD.  The story is compelling and due to it's being a real-life story, I knew I had to buy it.  Well worth the price!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author does a great job of fleshing out his characters (whether hero or villian), and helping the reader connect with (or despise) them. This is no small feat considering how many characters there are, but he does an amazing job. I'm normally not a fan of a story jumping from one character to another, but it's done so well here - I had no trouble staying in the flow of the story. The plot kept me turning the pages, there are no slow moments IMO. A nice pace of action, intrigue, with touches of magic, and fantasy. I enjoyed the book so much, I've added A Game of Thrones to my Netflix queue. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sweeping saga-type stories, fantasy/adventure, or the medieval time period.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Concise, easy to see, much information fast!  All I need in a simple view.  Better than other sources  for basic information.
B0057F869U|5.0|I love Jane Eyre and while I like many others struggled with a few inaccuracies, you have to appreciate the film for what it is. It is a splendid work of cinematography with a solid cast and an inspired rendering of a timeless classic. I would highly recommend this poetic adaption of Jane Eyre.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should try it. It's the best. The yellow guys are the best. Dave is the best. Write a review.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this application...... The best applicarion out there for adults and for kids. Thanks Kindle you make my reading easier &#60;3&#60;3&#60;3
B000065V42|4.0|I love movies. This is a great child's movie. I have it on vhs we are trying to convert all vhs to dvds. you sold this for a very  fair price. Thank you
0470913029|5.0|I bought the book out of curiosity, not expecting to buy into the diet.  It's packed with interesting and valuable information that leaves you wondering &#34;Why haven't I ever known this before?&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is way better than temple run, subway surfers and any other app of this sort. The minions are hilarious and the graphics are amazing. This is a wonderful game to play 5 stars for all ages!!!
B008X8P8A8|2.0|I have played and loved Shogun Total war. I had hoped this game would be like that with the map to conquer Japan. It is so hard to find good games for my tablet.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It is mess up I can't even get the real candy crush saga it doesn't even work for my tablet so I am VERY VERY MAD!!!!!!
B000XT1P3E|5.0|When trying to change over my old VHS tapes, of course Notting Hill/Erin Brockovich were two movies I had to have on DVD. These are two great movies and I am so glad they have been available through Amazon.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game but I think that we should be able to create your own character. But I still love it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm a fan of temple run and if you are too and have a  of sence humer you will love this game! And I have only had this app for 2 days.
0486219577|5.0|when I purchased this book, I could not have imagined the absolute beauty of the penmanship that would await me inside! Spectacular.... I dont however think I could ever do this with a pen, however I have used the bird in a picture drawn by myself to my son. Then added some of my own swirlies. It turned out so good, I didnt want to fold it to mail it. I was shocked myself. So, thanks for the beauty in this book.
B0000019PA|5.0|For the longest time I simply couldn't understand why my boyfriend seemed to obsess over this album, I enjoyed \\"Oh, Comely,\\" but didn't really give the others a listen.<br />I was already fairly used to Mangum's voice from listening to that one song so often, along with his take on \\"I Love How You Love Me,\\" so I didn't have the same immediate reaction to his voice as so many others when I finally decided to just sit and listen to the full album.<br /><br />I got my headphones, opened the album in my music folder, and just listened. From the first strums of the guitar in King of the Carrot Flowers Pt. 1 all the way to the closing notes of Two-Headed Boy Pt. 2, I couldn't help but paint the most beautiful images in my mind. Some songs are still able to make me weep, and I couldn't fully explain why if my life depended on it. It's as if this album takes you into a new world. A world full of celebration, mourning, death, liveliness, abandonment, longing, regret, hope, love, loss, confusion, pain, anger, and happiness. I probably put way too many words there, but I couldn't describe how it feels to listen without including each of them. It's just a whirlwind of emotions that you don't imagine music giving you.<br /><br />This is one of those album's that I feel everyone experiences differently, but can describe in similar ways. One of the key differences is that some songs simply affect people on a more intense level than others. For example, The Fool leaves me with a deep, solemn feeling, while Communist Daughter gives me a lighter, less intense emotion, but they're both two of my favorites. Each song strings you along and thrusts you into a new place in your mind that you yearn to explore, so you'll find yourself listening to this album over and over again just to return to whatever place you were taken. The problem is that you never do return to the same place as when you first listen. You find new lands, some wonderful and others heartbreaking, but you never stop searching.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone. I know that the strain in his voice combined with the excited instruments may be a much for some people, but you learn to love and appreciate Mangum's voice. In fact, after listening to the first few songs, you probably won't want any other style voice to sing these beautifully written lyrics. When combined with the whimsical music, it's hard to imagine it being any other way.<br /><br />I know this review was a bit messy and repetitive, but I was trying to get all of my thoughts written down at once.<br /><br />Just listen.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a very good read, grabbing me from the first page and not resolving the mystery till the close. Loved Harold and  Queenie, grew to love Maureen.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|Why is Kristin Stuart such a stupid hoe? I really think she should have ended up alone, and Jesse's character is just as screwed up.I guess they deserve each other.
B0073COMUW|4.0|Bought a total of 6 bulbs.  1 bulb  started to flicker 3 weeks later and another bulb started to flicker a few days after the 1st bulb.  Returned the 2 faulty bulbs to Amazon without any problems & bought 2 more bulbs to replace them.  All is bright now... fingers crossed.
B000069AT7|5.0|This is a real good purchase, it gives all the details on the making of the movie.  It was great seeing the actors talk about their experiences.  Good to hear from the producer, director and screen writer.  My grandchildren must see.
145210655X|5.0|This was a gift for a father and son who are both star wars fans. There is also one for little girls called Darth Vader's little princess. They're cute and funny.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This app is offered for free but at every turn one is asked to purchase stars...annoying! Other than that my grandkids (6-8) enjoy playing with it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|We watched this on our date night and both enjoyed it! You can never go wrong with a Denzel movie.
B003UESJJC|5.0|So Is the mood I remember news at those years. Horror and madness. Wonderfull picture and sound at hand with director. Redux result the best.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game but wish you could pause it. Like the layout and love that you're not forced to listen to cheesy music.
0802473156|5.0|I bought this as a way for my fiancé and I to prepare for our marriage.  It is a great book and now we are using the strategies and techniques to address conflict and problems and make sure we are meeting each others needs.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I saw all the individual movies leading into this one, it met my expectations. Lots of action, not a lot of character development, you should watch the others first for that.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Bought this for my fiancé.  He loves the movie and was impressed with the quality of the blu ray considering the age of the movie.
1250012570|5.0|I could write a whole page of things about this book... but I'll just say, I fell in love with Eleanor & Park & their first loves with each other.  The way their relationship started & grew... to the protective nature Park had over Eleanor... to wanting nothing but them to have a happy ending.<br /><br />Loved every minute of this book.
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|If I had wanted a comic book I would have gone to Dell. What a disappoinrment. The first 6 were great reads.
B008KNUKVI|4.0|The songs are great. They are just as good if not better than on the Sing Off. However, I really wish they had more of a selection.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is a family favorite. We quote it all the time. &#34;We thought you was a toad!&#34; I personally think it's one of my favorites. If you haven't seen it, you need to.  So happy to finally own it on DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played in my life. if you like subway surfers and minions then I definitely recommend it. awesome game!
B0042ETJU2|4.0|For this great price I got a wonderful collection, I would rate this item 5 stars if only the digital copy was available to use. The bad thing when I tried to download the digital copy, but a note said that the code should be redeemed by September 29th 2012 which means that the code is no longer valid. I thought this might be useful for people who think of having a digital copy on the go.
B008602KQI|2.0|Was expecting to be entertained. Seemed to go nowhere very slowly. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The end.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Good amount of action, good actors.  I thought this movie wasn't going to be good, but it did turn out to be great movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very cute and entertaining. Not to hard to achieve new level as even without paying for extra acorns wit real money
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Think Die Hard, but with better supporting cast.  Malkovich totally steals the show!  It's predictable, but still fun to watch.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The high definition quality is much better on Blu-Ray than what's broadcast over television.  The historical facts, and commentaries are a real bonus.  Mark Anthony, Cleopatra, Octavia, and Augustus Caesar 'Octavian' are my 49th great grandparents.  This series is like watching a bit of my own personal family history.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. My wife had me complete it for her. Great memory game I'll give it back and see how long it takes her to complete
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it all the time just for fun. Zombies, creepers, skeletons, I don't like them at all so I turn on peaceful mode. The best part is that it has join game. I never used it tough. Well just buy it already. Have fun!
B000B5OD4I|4.0|I have owned this watch for approximenlty one week. It was delivered in a timely manner. The watch was everything that I reserched for several weeks. It is modestley priced and has a very professional look. It is listed as a divers watch, although I am not a diver, the watch will fit in well with my active lifestyle. I would have no hesitation to use this watch on Kayaking trips and long distance running. I will evaluate this item in the future again, once I have had a chance to use it more. I would recommend this watch for anyone looking for a great watch with the ability to withstand an active lifestyle. I did upgrade the watch band to the one that is offered, it was worth the upgrade for myself.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I became attached to this book in the very first chapter.  I couldn't wait to pick it up again to find out what was going to happen to these twins and their disfunctional parents.  The character development is fabulous and the story riveting.  I was actually sad to be finished with &#34;Canada.&#34;  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for my husband to read it so we can discuss!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series! I liked the first two books a little more than this one, but it was still a good read. It was just a little overly mushy at times. It has been well established that these two are in love, so having Eva saying &#34;I love you&#34; in every other sentence was a little too much.
B000002KHF|5.0|one or the Best one done!! Love Van Morrison especially when I got a bit older, now I Love to listen to him.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book- the story was intricate and well told and the characters were very real. I took the book on vacation and ended up staying up late most nights just to read it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its rhe funnest game i have ever played in my life. E very one has or is going to watch despicable me and they loved it but now you get to play it cool!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but about half way through i really started to enjoy it- the only bad thing was that the ending felt a bit hurried and at a rather odd point in the story- i wanted more resolution!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the app, can not wait for more rooms very addictive. Challenges your mind and your memory. I recommend for all ages.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This was a total waste of my time, I like Wahlberg as an action character, and in Invincible he was very good. This movie just sucked on every level, the story was dumb, the script lacked any direction except stupid, what can I say...if you haven't seen it and your past kindergarden or puberty, don't bother.
0062124293|3.0|Caitlin Moran's book is supposed to be the modern feminist's guide. She is definitely comical, and a good writer, and speaks from her true experience, but this book has its limitations. She can only speak from her identity as a woman, and not everyone's (which is impossible!). Her anger and rage and fear and honesty is so real--I admire her struggles with weight and family and sex and love, but I wonder if she also wrote this book from a perspective of &#34;winning&#34; while being a feminist--she still ended up slimmer, attracting men, married, and with a great job and an international presence. It is definitely a valuable perspective in what should be a diverse chorus of women's voices, but I had trouble relating to some of hers. That's just because we're different which is no one's fault!
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Love this album the only true thing missing is Bill Ward but excellent after so many years they still deliver Sabbath.<br />Thank you Father Ozzy,Tony and Geezer for making this album a true statement to why Sabbath became so almighty in the first place,good job boy's.
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|This album is a show stopper. It's VERY different. Lots of off time signatures, weird riffing and strange melodies. However, this is his heaviest release to date since the Pantera days. Much more raw and in your face than down, chunkier and slower than Superjoint, and more death-y parts. It took me a couple listens, but once I really heard it I love it now. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I fell like the next album, if he matures his sound a bit, WILL be a 5.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is the best storyteller today. A master of capturing the culture of Afghanistan as well as universal human spirit.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Great concert from one of my favorite groups of all time!  If you like CSN, you will love this set.
0316044695|5.0|I found it very difficult to put this book down once I started reading. Such a great story of our amazing service men and the lengths they will go for each other no matter the pain. Lengths that we, back in the states, get a huge benefit from. Without these brave and ultra-hardened men we would not have the things we all take for granted everyday.<br />I have also read &#34;American Sniper&#34;, by Chris Kyle, which is also fantastic and near impossible to put down, and these are on pretty much equal footing. They are both US Navy SEALs in battle zones, but that's about where the similarities end with these two books. &#34;American Sniper&#34; is an account of Kyle's time Iraq and how he became the deadliest sniper in American military history , whereas, this book is Luttrell's story of what happened and how he survived. They both tell the tale of their experience in becoming SEALs, and splice in stories from home and such. Get both books, you will not be disappointed.<br />Just a side note: I personally thought Kyle, in his book, expressed the &#34;SEAL humor&#34; more effectively.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I had not thought about Buffalo Springfield in many many years...Ran across this album on You Tube and so enjoyed listening to it that I decided I had to buy the album to add to my collection of memories of great music. Some really good sounds on here.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Un libro exquisitamente escrito, conforme lo vas leyendo, se torna mas intrigoso. Un libro escrito con un gran sentido del humor, en ocasiones, triste en otras con maldad, en fin me encanto, no te arrepentirás de leerlo.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I was completely caught up in this story from beginning to end.  The story is told from several viewpoints, so the reader has to patch it all together, a little at a time.  As the main character lives through one horrific experience after another, he learns and matures.  The writer adds just enough humor and makes us just curious enough to keep on going, to wonder what the characters will do next.  Much of this is well researched, some of it is supposition, but it all works together to tell a tale of loneliness, horror, deception, courage, pain, ugliness, beauty, love and sacrifice.  It wasn't until the very end that I figured it out--loved the climax to this.<br />What got me to read this book was reading Adam Johnson's interview with Dear Leader's personal sushi chef, who defected and was living in Japan when he talked with him, from GQ just a few days ago: ,<br />[...]<br />That is also great reading.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Fun game! You get to take TAKE of the pets and play ball with animals. Lots of animals to buy house are kinda expensive.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|She is always my favorite so I don't think I wouldnt buy music. This is no exception. Love her  music
B00555X8OA|5.0|I liked it a lot but it is a heavy reading it took a longer time than usual to read it
B006N0MLJO|5.0|I have been building, contacting and doing  estimates since 1983.  Great tool to have with you and we all have our phones attached to us.  Same calc would cost 50-100 bucks at hd.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is my very favorite all time book/story ever.<br />I have read it numerous times.<br />Thank you for making it available for my Droid and Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a bewwy fun game and I recommend it to despicable lovers :P also I recommend it to those who like temple run agent run etc.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book for those who want to understand what life is like for our Elite soldiers. It is a first hand account of the training, discipline and sacrifices made by the elite Navy Seals. It also tells the story of the Bin Laden mission with detailed drawings of the flight, compound layout and floor by floor layout of the building. I am a Gulf War veteran and this story moved me. I have the highest respect for these soldiers.
B00B79OYIC|5.0|This film is top notch and the soundtrack on vinyl doesnt dissapoint either. Buy this, you won't regret it, promise.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought the movie was almost as good as the book which I loved. The acting was superb making me feel the tensions and emotions on the screen. Well done!
1468179993|1.0|1. This is NOT a book of advanced speaking principles or TED-specific information, so the title is misleading.  It's a book of elementary principles -- the kind of stuff that you'd learn in Toastmasters within your first couple of months.<br />2.  There ain't much here, folks. It's a *very* short book: only 112 *small* pages with lots of white space!<br />3.  The writing isn't that good.<br />4.  I didn't think it was worth reading, so I didn't finish it.  Thankfully it was at the library, so a lot of people can see for themselves that it isn't worth buying.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I am having trouble setting the icon -- I have selected the color and the icon and clicked on the icon but then pushing the OK button does nothing and I can't go any further.  What can I do to resolve this problem?
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Awesome book. Very different from the movies but honestly a million times better. VERY highly recomended and a must read.
B002QS1O36|5.0|After I seen Gerard Butler in law abiding citizen and became a fan I had to rent the phantom of the Opera as a second movie and thought he has a nice singing voice and was impressed with the entire movie all together. The ending was a heartbreaker when she chose Raoul over The Phantom.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Once again, Neil Gaiman charms with a beautiful book about childhood, friendship, and the mystery of worlds.  It is wonderfully written, but easy to read;scary enough to be interesting, yet safe for older elementary school age children.
B000TYWAUA|5.0|They got the perfect actor to play in this movie I mean action and adventure from start to finish &#34;Yahoo&#34;
0307476464|4.0|Reading Murakami is like listening to a really good jazz ensemble. Intertwining themes punctuated by soaring solos. Nice experience if you let it.
B008VZCU2W|5.0|This movie was accually viewed on Cable one night after I had seen it I found it be very suspenseful and filled with action and a decent nude butt shot from Gerard Butler in the middle of the movie. I read origionally Jamie Foxx was suppose to play Gerry's part and visa versa but they changed their parts over. Perfect ideal If you like Gore Get the Directors Cut of Law Abiding Citizen it tells more of the story.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The story of Harold Fry was very gut wrenching and emotional.  Harold knew what he wanted to accomplish - and why he would want to do so.  His pilgrimage was a effort that made him a new man. It also affected other people who wanted to be a part of what he was doing.  Nancy Mafrige
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I was probably 10 when I first saw this movie and seeing the cover on the VHS tape made me think it was a horror movie...not so!  Watching it again as an adult brings back many memories and recognized many jokes/inuendos that were over my head as a kid.  Great movie and one that will get stuck in your head!  Enjoy!
B000001EGE|4.0|Forget Elton John's Greatest Hits part one. Just buy Madman Across the Water, Tumbleweed Connection, & Honky Chateau to understand why Elton John is a legend. He cranked these three albums out in 2 years!!<br /><br />It's a blast to hear EJ at the peak of his phenomenal singing: soulful, poppy, but with a rock edge. During this stage, he & Taupin were in love with The Band & Leon Russell, so there is a funkiness, a backbeat, a gospel soul that totally disappears when he becomes a jet-set popstar. For people who hate all the excess & drama that EJ has come to represent, it's a joy to hear him when it was all about the music.<br /><br />The majority of songs are very strong here. You get huge singles and sleepers--deep cuts. Where did Billy Joel get 50% of his sound? Listen to \\"Mona Lisa & Mad Hatters\\" (or \\"Your Song\\"), \\"Mellow\\" is really strong, as is \\"Amy\\". The only weak tunes to me are \\"Slave\\" & \\"Hercules\\". Though other people dig them.<br />I loved this record when I was a kid, & 30 years or more later, I re-bought it on CD & was amazed how well it held up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|**Copy of this book was received in courtesy of author for an honest review**<br /><br />QUOTE: \\"When I touch you, I'm touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I'm kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I've ever seen and you know I can't not kiss it. And when I make love to you--I'm doing exactly that. I'm making love to you because I'm in love with you.\\"<br /><br />SHORT SUMMARY. Sky was adopted thirteen years ago, or that's what her mother, Karen, told her. She didn't remember who her father was and she didn't really had the urge to find out. All of the memories from her childhood were faded away and she didn't feel like exploring any of it. She was happy. She had Six, her amazing best friend, and she was finally going to a real high school after being homeschooled for many years. Her love life has never been very advanced despite anything that she tried because she never felt anything. The only reason why she would make out with guys is because it made her feel numb. One day she goes to get some groceries and meets Holder, beautiful and absolutely hot guy that makes her get butterflies and feel like she can't even remember her own name. It feels like she known him her whole life and his words... It's like he always knows how to say the most perfect thing. But it's not until she finds out the truth about herself, about Holder, Karen, and even her father who makes her wish she never find out in the first place.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS: O.M.G. I CRIED.I cried so much, I still want to cry just thinking about it. I seriously never thought that just a few words can bring that kind of a twist to the story and makes my heart ache for her. I usually don't tell any of the books to my boyfriend (mostly because he doesn't really care) but I made him listen to this one! After every single twist I would start cussing and crying and had to tell him what was going on! I could tell he liked it as well. But back to the book. I think that I have never seen a more beautiful writing. There were so many kissing scenes and each one of them just made you feel like it was their first kiss. I got blushed a couple of times during the book and it was nothing more than kissing. I love how caring Holder was and how the feelings were expressed all throughout the book. Fascinating! But seriously though. Read this book, it will make you cry and you will love it.ve never seen a more beautiful writing. There were so many kissing scenes and each one of them just made you feel like it was their first kiss. I got blushed a couple of times during the book and it was nothing more than kissing.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series can't edit until the next one. The  story line and the actors are wonderful.  I love the home decor as well
B004JK61K0|5.0|I read stories from people about the problem they had with the kindle fire hd app that comes with it, and i didn't believe it. I thought they weren't able to set up a stupid account, but it's not the problem. It doesn't recive the messages and if it does receive them it doesn't load the message... only the title of it.<br />SOOOOOO this is the app you are looking for,. it's really good and it works fine. You have a lot of settings so you can give it your personal look.<br />Good job!
B005LAII3A|5.0|It's action and suspense... usually movies are predictable but not this one... I would see it over and over again.
B006LRUVUA|1.0|Well, I installed it and after a few minutes it started an update and it stopped at 2%, ( that day i was having trouble with my internet connection), so i reset the internet modem and all the devices of my provider and the update wouldn't restart; i tried to restart my kindle hd but it didn't work. i tried to close it but nothing. So, i decided to delete it.<br />Overall I didn't even get to use it 1 time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the game and this is the best adventure tame ever and if you want to get the items in the game<br />then get pocketinvpro
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have mastered this entire game i couldn't do nothing i was so into i, took me some time but i got.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Had a lot of action and some interesting parts as in all Bond movies.  A bit predictable, a bit formulaic.  But that's kind of what you expect, again, in a Bond film.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|dark arcana is a really awesome but seriously why not have the full verison so it can be more fun
B00DB3HJ8E|5.0|It's great! I'm not in for Season 2. I know enough Brit culture... I'm gonna watch their mini-, I think I may enjoy it but...<br /><br />Not a series. It'll keep you too P.O.'d off. Watch this, watch The Daily Show, watch The Colbert Report, then watch the news. It's disgusting.<br /><br />Some Orange guy representing the House crying ... a lot. So much gov't run amok and apparently \\"on it's own,\\"... no collusion.<br /><br />No one in the gov't can cooperate on anything legal either... except voting to repeal ObamaCare 30-something times!<br /><br />Watching the news is like being spat at and missed then s#$t at and hit all over.<br /><br />This review 7/16/13, with the recent Supreme Court rulings, etc. ... it seems a bi-partisan effort to do what the Civil War couldn't. Divide the country and woe is us learned folk South (still) of the Mason Dixon. We gotta make a run for it!
B008MA83HC|5.0|The old and the new of Mana is in this edition, I love it! it has everything I remember and more, great buy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This whole series is one of the best since the Fifty Shades Of Grey book series.  For those who like that series, will definately  like this series too.
B007IX383I|3.0|I've come very late to the party on the newest Anathema album. The only prior exposure I've had to this band is one of their earlier albums but it was enough to show me what they're all about. Now I am in two minds about Weather Systems. On the one hand, you need to respect the artists work, production, the amount of creativity, passion and effort that's gone into the album. On the other hand, you need to look at the enjoyment factor for the listener. The two do not go hand in hand, art is not necessarily like that. Something that could have had a lot of time spent towards it could lack soul, instead presenting the impression of having soul. Whereas something simple that may not seem overly complex could indeed have a power behind it. Bob Marley's work is an unrelated but apt example of this premise.<br /><br />I feel that Anathema falls slightly into the first category with this album. Beauty for beauty's sake, emotion for emotion's sake and 'being soft' for the sake of trying to convey emotions can be done right or it could be done wrong. Here, I feel they get it about 80% correct. But it's the 20% that finds me completely tuning out, and in actuality, quite bored.<br />I have no issue with the string instruments, the female vocals and so on. But I do feel that this album doesn't always completely get across what it wants to. Such depth of emotion and pain may be beautiful, but shouldn't be boring - so that's why I can't enjoy this album so much as other people do.<br /><br />However, as I do respect the effort that's gone into creating Weather Systems. I just do not know who the target audience was. Anathema is NOT a metal band. They are hardly even alternative rock. They might be classed instead as a progressive rock group - but if you were to then compare them to their contemporaries, there are bands who pull far mightier punches. Dream Theater, Threshold, even Opeth with their softer forays have done a more compelling job of retaining a listers attention. So,in this respect, I think Anathema is for a very specific sort of listener - a little closer to commercial Grammy and less underground. A little more Taylor Swift and a little less Lady Gaga. So what have you.<br /><br />A minor gripe here, but one I want to mention. I thought the last track was the strongest and most interesting for me. But I thought the \\"Whats up\\" sample at the end of the song (7mins 26secs) absolutely wrecked the entire song and therefore marred the entire album experience for me. Whoever added that? Should be shot. Just saying.<br /><br />I do not know if this will be on rotation much in my player, but I can only say the artistry or work ethic alone rather than enjoyment factor justifies the purchase for me. However, if you're reading this, you will realise you would be buying something that a lot of others appreciate as a masterwork. Try before you buy. 3 stars.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great book I loved it, very inspirational, and opened up my mind to great things. I suggest to get it, must read, the best. Great book
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this with my wife. I especially liked the culture aspect, and in particular the language development. This is a fun read that at times I could hardly put it down. I'm definitely interested enough to read on and see where the series goes.<br /><br />I did have a few gripes about this book, least of which was the authors... interesting... choices of chapter separation :)<br /><br />Beyond that there were three plot elements that I thought could have used some work...<br /><br />Spoilers below...<br />First: The book is called Maze Runner and Tom himself decides he's going to be the best Maze Runner ever, yet the part of the story where he's actually a runner is minuscule.<br /><br />Second: It frustrated me a bit how little they actually learned or did for themselves, yet they're supposed to be the best and brightest, and the experiment was supposedly a success; the only reason they really figured anything out is because Tom got all the answers in the changing, and the only reason they survived before that is because everything was provided for them, and because they took so few chances. Another issue I have within this issue is how little chances they could take; every real chance for experimentation and growth was met with failure and usually death. They were pretty much corralled into doing nothing until a savior came a long and drugged himself up until he could remember the cheat sheet.<br /><br />Finally: It seems to me that killing off potential rescuers of earth is a pretty poor approach to solving the worlds problems. Most of the deaths were random enough to where they could hardly be termed \\"survival of the fittest\\" deaths, so potentially the \\"fittest\\" may have been accidentally or indirectly eliminated. In that regard it was like a more brutal (with much less obvious benefit) version of Ender's Game.<br /><br />Overall though I enjoyed it quite a bit, so don't let my few gripes ruin it for you too much.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I oftentimes don't want the lawyer/cop shows because of grisly stories or violence (especially as I'm winding down for the day).  This is a fun show, has some good stories and I enjoy relaxing and watching it.
B009SS9632|5.0|Thanks George RR Martin for introducing Tuf to me.<br />The teacher of life's lessons, indeed.<br />I love the guise of the gentle giant cruising through the universe being the moral metre to his universe, with a little help from the deadliest, yet handy weapon, of all time.<br />We were introduced to all of life's characters through the cast of this tale. Some just plain nasty while others using all the wiles to survive the infuriating political system that seems to evolve in all societies , doesn't matter what time or place we find our selves in.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|just like most 1st gen kindles out there, mine had crippling issues with the usb charger port. Instead of repairing my kindle, Amazon sent me this hunk of junk that did nothing to fix the problem that existed with the device from day one.
B0000A0DRY|4.0|Once my mother finally got this she was totally thrilled! Even though there was a problem with delivery I am just happy she got it & she is happy!! :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have really enjoyed this TV show.  The characters are strong and fun to watch.  I look forward to more episodes!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a most unusual story with excellent character development and plot.  It kept my interest on every page and chapter.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|I guess i have watched it about 20 times and just love the story line.  Clint Eastwood does a great job being a vulnerable guy and yet tough when he needed to be.  Not everyone will like this movie since it does not have gratuitous gory violence, no bad language, no really evil people or monsters.  It is just a wonderful cold war drama full of suspense with each side trying to outsmart the other.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|The other two novels by this author were excellent.  And the Mountains Echoed was so disjointed I couldn't tell one character from another or have much feel for either time or place.  Sorry I purchased this book
0670014893|5.0|\\"Art does not organise parties, nor is it the servant of colleague of power. Rather, the work of art becomes a political force simply through the faithful representation of the spirit. It is a political act to create an image of the self or the collective . . . so long as the artist speaks the truth, he will whenever the government is lying or has betrayed the people, become a political force whether he intends it or not.\\"  --Lewis Hyde<br /><br />\\"A Delicate Truth\\" is one of Le Carre's best novels. Contrary to the negative Amazon reviews:<br /><br />*It does have a satisfying ending, one which happens to gain additional energy from today's headlines about whistle-blowers. But this only points to how attuned Le Carre's antennae are to the zeitgeist.<br /><br />*The author is hardly naive about the dangers of Islamic extremism. See his letter to the Guardian: [...] The focus of \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is not the dangers of extremism but corruption and the creeping corporatization in the U.S. and Britain of functions formerly thought to be governmental.<br /><br />*While the book takes an unambiguous stand against these dangerous forms of rot, it is first of all an autonomous good yarn and stands on its own as a \\"faithful representation of the spirit.\\"<br /><br />*Those who feel lost and confused in the novel forget that Le Carre has always paid readers the compliment of not spelling everything out, so we have to work a little, which results in our deeper participation. His characters here feel very \\"lived-in.\\" His style might be characterized as an integration of Henry James and Hemingway in the way it combines moral ambiguity and suspenseful action.<br /><br />*The quotation from Lewis Hyde above gives the lie to the grossly unfair assertion in the negative reviews that Le Carre is \\"hiding in the shadows.\\"<br /><br />I only hope I'm halfway as much on my game as Le Carre is at 81 if I live that long.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! each level is long enough to keep my interest without being too long. time passes quickly and love the challenge. completely addicted!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|By the third season, I've become familiar with the characters and their demeanor.  There were a few twists in the story<br />this season however.  The season finale' was a bit of a surprise.  Isn't it time for Mary and William to have some happiness?<br />We must wait a few more months to see.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Visually stunning with acting superb. Come to expect a great performance from Naomi Watts and Ewin McGregor, but their children were amazing and gave thoroughly onvincing performances.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It won't get past the gameloft screen. Which stinks because I want this on my iPod but I don't have enough room. Don't buy this app. Thank goodness it's free.
B0012DZ356|5.0|Every story was well written, Alice Munro is a short story Master. I love everything she has done - this is no exception. Highly recommend.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. The characters were deeply thought out, and really did act like normal teenagers. The subject of cancer was approached in a way that didn't make it feel overwhelming. It's truly a story about young love and loss. I laughed and I cried and it made me question myself in ways I could have never imagined.<br /><br />Thank you, John Green. For this amazing, amazing work of art.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  Lots of different things to look at, think about, solve.  Unfortunately, I am currently stuck at a level and have no idea what to do!  I wish there was some kind of help available.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is addicting. The best part is that it has so many levels and therefore never gets boring. I was addicted on my PC, and now I'm addicted to it on my Kindle.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Movie was very similar to the book.  The special effects often were good, and not distracting.  If you were not a fan of the other movies, you won't like this one either, but of all the Twilight Saga directors I think Bill Condon (Breaking Dawn)  did the best job.  I am slightly surprised this was rated PG 13.  I am not sure I would feel comfortable with a tween watching some of the movie.  Also, the birth scene would be very scary for younger kids.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This was purchased thinking it was used and therefore it would be &#34;scuffed&#34;. It came cello wrapped! The quality is great! The movie is great! The arrival time was great! I am extremely pleased!
B00BURWSHA|4.0|I bought this album because of Doug Aldridge's guitar playing but there's a lot of good rockin' tunes to discover here.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have a pretty busy life and don't have much time to read anymore.  I managed to read the entire Trilogy in just under 2 weeks.  I couldn't put them down and even found myself sneeking reading while I was at work.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|A fun and addicting game! Makes your brain work a little while having fun trying to get the crazy little gopher!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|If this were a director's cut, sure thing. But there were many scenes that added little and dragged on a lot. Still, a powerful if overall depressing movie.
0811877485|3.0|Not staying on the wall and there is not very many stickers in it.  They are cute though and easily removable.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|Very fun family game, durable components, beautiful art.  If you like board games this is a must for your collection.
0439882826|5.0|My son is a SW fanatic! While off to college, I bought him this book because he was homesick. He was so happy, he wouldn't open it for weeks. just kept picking it up and looking at it. Glad I made him happy.
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|Paired with my galaxy Tab 2 8.0 and it works beautifully. I can navigate android menus with it and it works with very little tweaking with most games that use a DPad<br /><br />Games I've used:<br /><br />Mario Bros<br />GTA 3<br />Sonic the hedgehog<br /><br />The controller is a bit small but very usable even for my big hands.<br /><br />Gaming on the go has returned!
0345529057|5.0|This box set is very nice.  I like the paperback, because it travels better than the hard back.  I'm currently reading the 3rd volume to and from work on the train each morning.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It was good watching the program that kept me guessing. The story line was like all others, but the various twists in the plot were good. I would certainly recommend watching and would wait for the other seasons. Comparisons with other shows is not correct, but I  guess are bound to happen.
0786891416|4.0|Richard Castle is a fictional author created by a group of screen writers, and the books \\"he\\" has written are the product of an anonymous author who had to imagine how this fictional character would have written them. I give that author, most likely Tom Straw, major points for the mental exercise that he goes through to write these stories.<br /><br />That being said, Nikki Heat, the fictional character based upon the fictional character Kate Beckett from the television series \\"Castle\\", and Jameson Rook, the fictional creation of the fictional writer Richard Castle, are fairly true to what we have learned about Beckett and Castle by watching television.<br /><br />The mystery itself is entertaining, but most people who read the book are going to split their time between comparing characters in the book with those on TV and trying to solve the mystery.<br /><br />The story line is simple. A wealthy land developer is thrown from the sixth floor of an exclusive apartment building. Add a Swedish Nanny, a Russian thug, a bookie, and a conniving wife and it makes an interesting mix, but the focus is always on Nikki Heat. I gave the book four stars because I liked the story but really liked the concept. A good read for fans of the TV show.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|I thought Warrior was going to be a wash but the movie peaked my interest from the first 10 minutes all the way through the end. The story line and life of Tommy lends a character that many can relate to but give a positive light at the end.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I can't begin to figure out how to use this program.  I just need to type in large size fonts on my tablet to communicate with my husband and thought this would be helpful.  Sure would be nice if they had a tutorial.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is incredible. It's exquisitely written, with action and adventure and good old 80s culture packed into every page.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|A great children's movie with plenty of humor for parents, too. There is a bit of mild cartoon violence that may make some parents with really young kids shy away, but the positive themes and transformative journey of the main character rivals that of \\"the Grinch\\"!
B005R32L66|4.0|I enjoyed talking and seeing my grandsons ,Am trying to get all of my children on Skype so we can talk more often.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|The book is well written, and the pace of the story moves quickly. The narrative alternates between the protagonist telling his story to a &#34;historian&#34; of sorts, and the events as they occurred. The author does a very good job of pulling this off and I never felt lost when the switch of perspectives changed. Overall this is a solid fantasy story and I look forward to the next book.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The best acting I've seen Ben Afleck do.  Never over the top, very believable.  Just a relatively ordinary guy doing his job in a heroic way. Very true to the period and a part of history we shouldn't forget.  This effort was overshadowed by the release of the Iranian captives in 1981, so it was a good story to hear.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is a must see for the family...... Needs to be in ever house in the nation....  HILARIOUS!!!!!  Zomies, Brits, Humor equals awesomeness.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is a fantastic use of time for everyone, young an old. I felt like this game was very fun for the whole family. With its cute graphics and addicting fun, you can't get any better game for free.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|As others have stated this app is missing a lot of the key features of the full version. The hang up/freese issue makes it even more frustrating.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have been trying to get it for my mom for years. When I got it, it was still in its, plastic wrap and it came faster than expected!
0345529057|5.0|Got my books before the estimated time of delivery and as stated in the title the books were in better condition than what had been described. I highly recommend using premierbookdealers if you're looking for nice looking quality books.
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie. My friends and I all thought it would be terrible and where amazed whenwe all thought it was a hysterical and wonderful film!
1419701533|4.0|Books were in good condition just as described. My  daughter was very pleased with them  also. Compared to other books I have bought I have no regrets.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is brain-staining to the maximum. I was stumped on where to go next. A complete work out for the mind
B00785P2QC|4.0|I purchased this game on the app store for the kindle fire. I have only had it for a few days but I am thoroughly enjoying playing this game. I find the goals the best part of the game as it gives you something to work towards:)
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I hated Mark Harmen for years.  I saw him in 2 roles where he was a really bad dude, and so convincing I decided he must be a bad dude for realz.  When NCIS came along I said &#34;I'm not watching that A hole&#34;.  The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it.  I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot.  All is forgiven Mark.  The show is smart, funny and fresh every time.  they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good, even in a prison camp which is not easy.  You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this froze my kindle fire and i had to delete it  dont get it whatever you do  please update this
B008220BLG|4.0|There is a new catagory of zombie, yes we catagorize them.  This a fun romantic comedy with zombies.  I enjoyed it and the special features are really good.  The makers should be proud and the actors did a great job.  But do not expect anything even remotely scary.  This should maybe be baby's first zombie movie.
B001HN6922|1.0|Disc arrived in somewhat looking authentic packaging. Played okay the first time, but would not play after that. Not worth the one star.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The music is great, the cello is excellent, I've been looking for music like this and I am planning to get the second CD.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is really fun. It has really fair rules and is amazing for little kids and adults. I love it.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Seriously? Affairs, erotic scenes, love between siblings, and downright disgusting drama. These stories and characters turned my stomach. I don't suggest to anyone.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|I am not into games at all, that said, this is very simple.  Its retro feel had me right away.  I wish I  could use other  backgrounds, but I haven't  scored well enough yet.  It does seem very basic as a game, but that's what I like about it.  the game  reminds me  of  childhood when things were simpler.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I received my package on time and in retail packaging. Have charged and used only once but works great. You have to be careful which outlet you use (it has a 1 amp and a 2 amp) depending on the device you´re charging. The power bank looks and feels pretty solid and well made. It includes a black case, 2 cables (short one and a slightly longer one) and several adapters. This is really great for travelling specially with your family that everyone´s bringing a smartphone or ipod.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This storyline keeps your attention and is an excellent read for the summer.  I always look for brain candy in the summer and this keeps the reader interested.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This was way better than we expected it to be.  We really enjoyed it.  It is worth watching!  I had forgotten how great Tom Cruise can be in a movie.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Don't buy this app i payed money for it and it shut down and said camera not responding when i tryed to open,the effects are bad un helpful
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I figured out the title is referring to the wool that is pulled over the eyes of the innocent. You find it hard to put it down as there is always new information surfacing.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Smash is such an amazing series. Can't wait to start season 2! The songs are simplying flawless and the actors really get the job done.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Surprisingly clever. I started this book late last night, and read until 2 am. Then got up this morning and started again. I usually do not like books that are written in omniscient point of view, but this one may have changed my mind a bit. The prose was smooth and reminded me of Hemmingway, while the sweeping descriptions and characterizations reminded me a bit of Steig Larsson and then the clever twists and turns of the plot, of Oscar Wilde.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, highly recommend it, and would read more from this author!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I saw 4 times, better each time, the music and performance are beautiful, well set for the time of the opera
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you like period pieces with good character development, interesting plot twists and relatable human interactions, then this show is for you.  Downton Abbey's detailed depiction of class division, gender roles and family dynamics in England during the 1920s remains solid.  If you've seen the first two seasons, then this is a must watch!  If you've missed the first two, then now is the perfect time to download them. Though proper etiquette, especially while dining, remains a focus, it is the expertly served proper wit that makes this show deliciously enteraining.  Season 3 does not disappoint!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Fantastic I have had a problem with insomnia in the past this app puts me in  completed relaxation mode and its nighty nite time:)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I were glued to the TV for each episode.  Every engaging story.  So sad at the end of year 3!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Love all the Die Hard movies...I think this is the best! The chase scenes are riviting and very intense! Wow!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell & his teammates are tru American heros! A great read that you will want to re-read over & over again!
B0000UJDLM|4.0|Not as good as Short Circuit 2. This one is good for the intro movie a little streched in places.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|The product is not child friendly. The heads pop off easy and they do not stand up on their own. (Only Miranda does because of her huge dress)<br /><br />My daughter likes playing with it but gets frustrated about their heads not staying on. This toy has plenty of room for improvement.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|All my family loves this older movie. Johnny 5 will steal your heart. A fun movie for the whole family.
B007SUW24W|4.0|I did not know who Ed Sheeran was but I fell in love with one of his songs called &#34;Kiss Me&#34;.  If you are a fan of the Vampire Diaries, this song was played during the love scene between Elaina and Damon at the end of Season 3.  I did listen to the whole CD and found another song on the album that I liked called The A Team.  He has a really good singing voice and I will probably look for  more of his songs in the future.
0316056898|4.0|I'll be honest.  I have not seen Tina Fey in anything aside from her movies and know nothing about her aside from what I've read in People magazine and now from what I've read in her book.  While I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book it is geared more towards people who have watched her in SNL as well as in 30 Rock.  I personally liked the personal details that had nothing to do with show business and wish there had been more of that in there. My absolute favorite part of the whole book was the chapter on her prayer for her daughter.  Read it and copy it and keep it with you when you're own daughter needs a prayer. I will be printing it out and posting it everywhere.  I also can identify with her struggle on whether to have more kids which helped me like her even more.  So to sum it up- check it out even if you haven't watched her every move on TV.  :)
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love love Dexter!  So sad that it is going off the air.  I've just recently discovered the show, started at season 1 and am now watching season 6.  I'm addicted!!
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|I am not sure that this is a true copy because i have had difficulty playing it on my son's excellent system. In fact i had to abandon it because of the noise. It was hugely expensive and as I ordered it when I was in africa I had nothing with which to compare it. In fact i am today taking it to a specialist to verify its authenticity and will be in touch again.

B00DU74U74|1.0|I never read the book and I hate doing bad reviews, but the movie was not good at all as far as the plot goes. I'm sure the book would have been great and I can see the idea of that, but just because it was written by the same author of the Twilight series does not mean it had to go to film. For one, no cool effects or alien technology or anything that really jumped out at me. For two, no real action to speak of. For three, it was basically a girl running around talking to herself the entire film. Unless you want something to help you sleep, don't bother with it. I've seen better direct to DVD films than this.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I got it for my grandkids, They love the creativity of it and could play for hours if their parents haven't put a time limit on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One would think this to be a sleepy, dark British drama, but it is anything but that. The writing is superb, the acting is top-notch, the cinematography is excellent and the editing is Oscar quality. You will be drawn to these characters in the very first episode and won't be able to wait to see what happens in the next episode. Start with Season 1 and go from there.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Not quite for kids, but not for the serious adult either. Still, good fun if you like animated movies and stories.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the writing style and found unexpected surprises throughout the book. I wanted to root for Jacob, but had a really hard time....
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Classic story told in such a way that both adult and child can relate.  great combination of whimsy and reality.

B0011NVCSO|5.0|Listening to Bon Iver on vinyl is a gift. True folk music without pretension. A must have for the vinyl collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was as good as the rest of the seasons so far!  Please have Season 4 on Prime soon!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first but i must say this game is challenging and very fun works great on my kindle
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent historical, well documented book about the true &#34;hidden&#34; practices of American medicine in the fifties and in some part continuing today.  This is a real eye-opner.  Great for starting conversation, recommending to others, understanding the medical research practices, and influence on todays laws, etc.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is very well made. Good story and very engaging. My wife and I just love this show. Waiting for next season.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|could watch it over and over, always like the Marvel comic characters. can't wait for the next movie. Prime comes in handy when nothing on TV.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I absolutely loved the final season of Gossip Girl.  But I wanted to see more!!  I am however glad that they concluded everyone's stories instead of leaving us hanging which some tv shows have a tendency to do.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|This is my favorite since Calculating Infinity. It's in heavy rotation around the house and in the car. I like walking home from the bar a little buzzed and listen to this.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire in order to watch and download videos.  It is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who uses YouTube on a mobile device.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much. Is it true that local governments were that irresponsible toward family's? Demonstrates the difference in individulals.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's funny,<br />but I put a hand easily.<br /> Pattern is simple.<br />I like it<br />simple deigned ,sound and my dauther is very happy gameming
161383280X|2.0|The content was fine but I ordered a hardcover and what I got was a paperback sized book with a cardboard cover. This is not a a real hardback and the advertised dimensions are generous.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|either you progress through the game very slowly and upgrade the crappy equipment as you find it or spend a lot of money to buy stupid gems. that's really the only bad thing about the game since its a pretty fun time killer even though the story is kind of lacking. if rather just pay a small amount for the game and just earn in game gold than get the game for free and only get to play for a few minutes per day
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the one app that I use daily and has changed the way I read books.  I am the type of person that always has a book nearby and the Kindle app allows me to carry multiple titles in a very small package.  I went to Italy with several books loaded and it was nice to be able to read on the plane, tour bus, etc. without the weight of a book in my hand.  The app is very easy to use and I like the new updates; books are easy to find on the carousel.  This is the first app I loaded when I had to change phones recently... couldn't imagine my phone without it.  Even my 82 y.o. mother has gotten into the swing with her new phone.  She rarely makes calls but loves to have a book close at hand!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I personally think that this is the best kid games I recommend it is the best kid game I have come across

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing game like everyone knows and now that it's mobile I don't have to bring my laptop everywhere
B0038M61BE|5.0|I have been listening to Art Pepper for a while now and totally enjoy his music.  This particular CD in my opinion is one of his best and I strongly recommend it.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Lasse Hallstrom is famous for making whimsical films. His movies tend to stand or fall on their screenplays. But with \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\"--with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy, taken from a novel by Paul Torday--Hallstrom taps into an appealing British sense of whimsy that elevates the movie.<br /><br />The story concerns Alfred (Ewan McGregor), a scientist in the British government's Department of Fisheries, and Harriet (Emily Blunt), a public relations executive. Harriet represents a wealthy Yemeni sheik (Amr Waked) who wants to make his country a salmon fisherman's paradise. Alfred at first condemns the plan as ridiculous, but soon the government--seeking any sort of positive news from the Middle East--forces him to take part, and he soon becomes obsessed. He and Harriet also become obsessed with each other, but there are complications: Alfred's brittle, ambitious wife (Rachael Stirling) and Harriet's Army officer boyfriend (Tom Mison). Meanwhile, Islamist fanatics oppose the sheik's plan, and seek to sabotage it by any means possible.<br /><br />There isn't all that much to the story of \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,\\" but Alfred, Harriet and the sheik are three of the most lovable characters in recent movies, and you come to care deeply about them and their plans. Alfred in particular is delightful, and Ewan McGregor gives one of his best-ever performances playing him. Also a standout is Kristin Scott Thomas as a profane, hard-charging government flack whose enthusiasm for the title project waxes and wanes with the latest opinion polls. Graced with beautiful photography and a strong music score, \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is a gentle, surprisingly satisfying film.
B009R6OTI2|4.0|This is a great way to learn the product and how it works.  I downloaded the syllabus onto our iPad and the lessons on the computer.  This way we could read from the iPad while performing the lessons on the computer.  Over all I would say this is a very helpful book if you want to learn the intricacy's of Aperture.
0061122416|2.0|2-1/2 stars rounding down. I wanted to read this when I found out it was the 5th most top read book in the world (behind The Bible, Quotations from Chairman Mao-Tse Tung, the Harry Potter series, and the Lord of the Rings series). When I mentioned this to my book club, we decided to make it our book of the month since they hadn't read it either. It was a religious and philosophical journey. Since I'm neither particularly religious nor philosophical, it just didn't interest me all that much. I dig the parts about the universal Language of the World and also the point of the story about not giving up on your personal journey. But I'm surprised that after the touchy-feely long, SLOW, mostly unadventurous journey of listening to his heart, his personal treasure in the end was truly a material treasure. I think I prefer the girl being his true treasure or his satisfaction with going on a journey (Bilbo anyone?) being his true treasure. And, why is this titled The Alchemist when the alchemist does not play a large role in the book? I'll ponder that and hope to have some good discussion at book club next month if I can remember the details of the book that long. I'm sure this is one of those books rich with literary meaning but I've never been good at picking out those hidden meanings nor at enjoying a book because of the literary devices. This wasn't an \\"adventurous enough\\" adventure for my tastes but I'm satisfied that I've now read 7 of the top read books in the world.
0062127241|4.0|This was a well written book and gives you insight into his world as well as the busniness fo rock n roll of his time.
B00C2PO09I|3.0|Seems like they got lost in the concept and failed to tell a compelling story. A lot of disconnected pieces, you never care about the charectors and had tons of small errors that started to make it feel dumb.  Too bad, it was beautiful and could have been great if it was less focused on being clever and a lot more focused on delivering on the emotional depth the theme represented. Sorry I bought it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. We never pay for TV shows, but this one is worth it! Great acting and writing. Someone actually pulled off making a solid and respectable zombie show that has made me question more than once \\"what would I do if that happened\\" as though it ever would! So totally hooked. Definitely recommending this one.
1878424114|5.0|This book is very easy to read which provides things to reflect on. If you're someone who's always looking to improve yourself, this one is a must. =) Chopra did it again, such a great author who provides real life insights and reflection!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie..is one that can be seen so many times...I think it should be shown in the schools!! on perseverance, survival..and making it!! and, no excuses drive!!<br />I bought this for our second home...
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|the game is really good but the free version is exactly as this one. I though the secret levels were going to open in this version
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The honesty...fact details..are to be respected..as so many times..so much is covered up...no matter what your political persuasion..this is history,..and unreal details..and in a sense..confessions..I thought 2 times before buying this but I saw this on TV..and said..we need this in the library!..you will not be disappointed...I wasn't..and I'm not political..in any sense..of the word!!
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Exceptionally boring movie with all the production value and script-writing skills of a Lifetime movie.  Save yourself some money and just watch TV.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|My daughter was actually the one that requested I buy this since she had watched it at school and I actually had part 2.. always loved watching Grease!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Me and my grandson play this game we really do enjoy it  we have lots of fun it is easy enough for my grandson to teach his four years old brother to play thanks
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I think they like it................they play it alot.  I have no idea how it works,  what it does,  or why it does it..........but I'm sure they do...............
B00992CF6W|5.0|I honestly think this this is the best app ever I play every single day my parents get so mad at me because I sit on it all day long!I play Pc and xbox its a fun game you should get this app
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|What a wonderful, body of work. Joe is one of the best and Beth must be an angle sent to make our lives better. They both put their heart and soul into this. Get it and enjoy
B001B6PBBK|3.0|I hate to repeat the sentiments of the other reviewers here, but this movie can't help but be a reminder of the loss of the wonderfully talanted rising star, Brittany Murphy. She truly shines in this delightful flick, especially with her quirky American, yet not quite British accent (I found it endearing, not cheesey as a few others have written here). The additions of Matthew Rhys (The Americans), Catherine Tate (Dr. Who) who is a hoot, Dawn French (French and Saunders fame) who puts in an appearance as the hilarious therapist, and even Orlando Bloom (./drools) round out the comedy stylings of this lighthearted romantic romp. Sure it runs the gamut of comedic plot devices and cliches, but what romantic comedy doesn't? It even begins pointing out how predictable these types of movies are and poking fun at itself. I appreciate when people and movies don't take themselves seriously. I was with them totally up until the ending, which left me feeling a bit let down (I hadn't predicted that). I would have given this 4 stars otherwise.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Last rocky movie! But it is still a killer series!  Couldn't ask for more! Plus it came in real good condition!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It's mahjong. There's plenty of different configurations to choose from and it has a decent interface. Me likes it !
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Goes to prove that you have great people in this world.  My uncle who flew B-17 over Germany would have really have enjoyed reading this.  I have a friend who is retired Air Force and he is reading the book.  I wish every world war II buff could read this.  They might find out that you had real heroes on both sides.
B00821OUT6|5.0|exciting show, I love Walking dead but I gotta say this one took the lead, Only down fall is they need more episodes per season...
B0058HDT2G|3.0|I'm a huge Selena fan, but I have to say this is my least favorite album of hers. Almost every song is cheap-sounding & the production is very basic. The highlights are &#34;Love You Like A Love Song&#34;, &#34;Bang Bang Bang&#34;, and &#34;When The Sun Goes Down&#34;. I could go without hearing every other song on this album & I'd be fine. The deluxe edition comes with four bonus tracks, but they're all pointless. You get three remixes and a Spanish version of an old song that was on her previous album, but the cover is a lot better than the standard edition. Overall, this album doesn't begin to compare to Kiss & Tell or A Year Without Rain, but it's an okay effort. I feel like I'd have been extremely disappointed if I was a fan back when it was released.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started playing. Its a little cheesy but i really like it so far! I really hope it stays this interesting
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I enjoy this movie very much...And the first five minutes of this picture always leaves me in tears. What can I say?
B001P7HUF0|5.0|This is a great package--perfect cast of actors, a great script (did not read the book so cannot comment) and great photography and a great director.  I had forgotten how great a movie this was and is ..........makes other movies weep!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Saw it in the theaters, rented it for a home bound family member. I can understand why Day-Lewis won the award for best actor...
B00DU73T08|2.0|So... this appeared to have a good story line and even though it had some bad reviews and low stars I decided to rent it. Bad idea... would be nice to get my money back. I found myself paying attention to my puppies and/or playing games on my phone. I only made it about 1/4 to 1/2 the movie before I decided to just turn it off. Movie got boring quick.... very slow... Pass on even renting/buying this movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is really fun but the Facebook liking and posting is annoying. You should be able to disable those goals.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|The strap works just as I suspected.  It keeps the RS-7 securely in place.  It's easy to adjust an fits comfortably.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|Fun and disappointing.  Their goal is to get you to buy with $$$, skills rather than play to earn them in a reasonable time.  .99 only allows access to most basic parts of game. After 11 completed games, still have not learned new abilities. Clearly making it painful to play more interesting levels of game unless you cough up some more skin. (Hehe)Has occasion issues crashing on android 4 Asus tablet.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If you're a business junkie like me or just admire great people, read this book. I rate it as one of the best books I've ever read.... and I've read hundreds. Enjoy.
0060751967|2.0|I love a good vampire romance novel, so I was intrigued by the title and description of this one.  It sounded like it would be sexy and funny.  It wasn't.  The idea was great, the author just didn't turn it into the charming story that it could have been.<br />From the very beginning it was silly and contrived.  There wasn't one scene where you didn't know exactly what was going to happen next.  The dialogue that was supposed to be funny was just goofy and childish.  The main characters were annoying and there was nothing that made me care what happened to any of them.<br />I usually don't write bad reviews.  Even when I read a book that is not the best in the world, I can usually find something good to say about it.  Being an avid reader I never give up on a book once I have started reading it - but several times I actually considered just giving up.  I did hang in there - just to be annoyed that I did.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This has been fun and for free, what can you expect, it worked perfectly well, thank you so much<br />Aloha
B007YZQVZM|5.0|I read this book when I was a little girl and it has always been one of my favorites.  When asked in school who my favorite historical figure was I always stated immediately and definitely:  Anne Frank.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to readers of all ages and genders.  Not only does it tell the moving and emotional journey of Anne's experiences hiding from the Nazis in such a small space with so many people - but it tells the story of what was going on during the war.  While reading this amazing account you can feel this young girl's bravery and patience with so much fear and fighting going on between the family members living together.  For such a young and innocent girl to persevere with so much insight and fortitude in the face of adversity such as she lived through is astounding.  Anne's writing reveals a young lady who is wise so far beyond her age.  When I think of her writing her story in her diary - never having a clue that so many people would ultimately read it and that she would be remembered and admired - it breaks my heart that this unique and amazing girl had to endure what she did and end up the way she did.  I think if I ever have the chance to visit that house where she and her family hid I would cry.  Through it all she still believed that people were still good at heart.  I wish that I had the faith in humanity that she did...<br />A final thought:  this is the unedited version of the diary that some schools wanted to ban because it had some personal observations from Anne on her body and the changes that she noticed as she became a young lady.  They are so innocent and so much a part of the story - the part that reminds us that she never got to experience being a woman.  Anyone who would want to ban this book for that reason is ignorant and should choose a different career.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Great movie.  It had lots of action.  It was great to watch in in Blu-ray.  Recommend to any Bruce Willis fan.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|Well done, brilliant acting. My only problem is I can't warm to most of the characters. Ellen remains the singular protagonist of any moral virtue. Damages can be beyond dark. I am watching for the second time & feel unsure if I can sustain such a dark view of what goes on 'behind' the scenes in the world of Law.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome app I like it a lot better than the first one I like the WWII theme to it much better than the modern one I think it should have more guns but other than that awesome app
0062213423|1.0|When I got ordered this book it was used and the condition was like new, and when I got it half of the pages had fallen out and the cover was trashed DONT BUY USED EVEN IF IT SAYS GOOD CONDITION!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Crisp graphics and just enough of a challenge for an hour or so of fun my children got most of the clues and with a little help from dad solved all of them
B000002O4X|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it many times and never get tired of it.  When ask what my favorite is I always say Out of Africa.  What a beautiful story.
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|There are a few catchy songs and I like the unique style, but it's not enough to keep me interested.
B00AK57N00|5.0|I like the game. It's tough when the platforms get skinny, but it's a perfect couple-minute distraction for those random waits life throws at you from time to time.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It was interesting at times but confusing most of the time.  Felt like there should have been a first book to explain who all the witches were.  Did not quite understand who the bad lady was for sure.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|This is a great listen. Heavy guitars and back to a more classic sound. Preview it and then BUY IT!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard of this series and wasn't that interested in watching it.. I recently took a trip where I was going to be in a plane and was due to have some long lay overs so I down loaded Downton Abbey and was hooked...watched all three series in a 10 day span.. can't wait for the 4th series
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|I love the feeling, description and humor that is revealed throughout the book that makes the people and places real.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Please do not waste your hard earn money on this movie. It was absolutely stupid. I love scifi but this just made our community look ridiculous.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|In full disclosure, I bought this for my children because I saw it on the Disney channel and loved it. I'm also a big Wallace and Gromit fan, so, if you like those, you will definitely love Shaun the Sheep. The claymation is fantastic as the characters seem to be living and breathing. The storytelling is superb, especially since there is no dialogue. The animators work mainly with expressions and actions, and the result is captivating. That being said, there are a lot of subtleties that may be lost on younger children, but it does not detract from the quality of these shorts. My oldest son is five, and loves Shaun. There is also enough action and zaniness for my younger son of 3 years.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Great read, seems a little short to be called a novel, however. Winds up kind of quick. Would recommend  anyway.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I knew that I needed it on DVD to complete my collection, and this was a great time to buy (it was on sale around Christmas/Black Friday). It is a good movie and the special edition has some good features.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|still working through some of the processes with some difficulty.  not much to add. facebook isn't that user friendly in my opinion.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Oh man, this is one of the best shows on TV.  I knew that I needed it on DVD and this was a great time to buy (it was on sale around Christmas/Black Friday).  I'm such a fan and it keeps getting better and better.  This collection is also great as you get 2 seasons together.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it!!! Such an amazing and well written book! I would recommend this book to everyone I know. It's the best!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Oh man, this is one of the best shows on TV.  I knew that I needed it on DVD and this was a great time to buy (it was on sale around Christmas/Black Friday).  I'm such a fan and it keeps getting better and better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love how the show keeps you guessing and all the twists and turns it takes. Sometimes, it really surprises me, especially how season 3 ended!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Oh man, this is one of the best shows on TV.  I knew that I needed it on DVD and this was a great time to buy (it was on sale around Christmas/Black Friday).  I'm such a fan and it keeps getting better and better.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you are looking for something to completely immerse yourself into this series is for you, Every episode looks & feels like a major motion picture. The entire production is flawlessly presented at a level I have never seen before in a mini-series. You will be tempted to watch it all the way through because it is just that addictive. HBO has set the bar so much higher than you could imagine making Game of Thrones. Enjoy it....I sure did!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|This movie is really fun and enjoyable.  You can't not love the Muppets! There have been some not so great Muppet movies in the past few years, but this brought it back.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like this show. To me its is &#34;Walking Dead Light&#34; or the Disney Version, except Aliens instead of Zombies. Its like the Walking Dead in that they have groups of people traveling together trying to survive an apocolypse.
145210655X|5.0|This book is really adorable.  I bought it for my dad who really introduced me and my brothers to Star Wars when we were kids.  Any Star Wars loving person (Adult or Child!) would love this book.

B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (filmed in black and white) stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory and staffing it with Jewish workers, this helps to keep as many people as possible from going to concentration camps as the Nazis order every Jew to be killed or moves to Auschwitz. Schindler bribes the Nazi officials in order for his Jewish workers to escape a certain death. He compiles a list of skilled workers needed to run his factory.<br />These workers are saved from a life of brutality or death.  A movie not to be missed, I am just sorry I didn't see it in a theater.<br /><br />Who ever saves one life,saves the world entire.<br />Oskar Schindler 1908-1974
B007L5LD9O|4.0|I'm a lover of the era that this movie took place & would highly recommend it for people of all ages.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Read this while vacationing in Denali National Park. Explores the adventurous life of a young, spirited soul out trying to find himself. I loved getting the author's perspective of what motivated Christopher McCandless to cut all ties to home and family, live as a transient, and eventually venture into the Alaskan wilderness on his own with limited survival gear. Would recommend this book to any and all, but it's a must if you're visiting Denali.
1594202842|4.0|This book, while may seem extreme to some, tells a lot about the culture that Amy Chua was raised in. I would recommend that whomever may read this book will have an open mind. It's an easy read and a fun one at that!
B00D97EZ4I|5.0|I've become a huge BoC fan over the past year, and love this LP.  It's some of their best work yet, although I'd advise listeners new to BoC to check out Music Has The Right To Children before tackling this album.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Its a great mouse. Smooth and nice to the touch. Works well when gaming for hours on end. The only thing i would change is i would like the tribal art under the mouse wheel to light up. It doesn't nor says that it does just think that would make it cooler.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|well written, insightful and above all laugh out loud funny!  First book by this author that I have read, enjoyed it so much I got two more by the same author!
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Machete is by far a very entertaining movie by Mr. Robert Rodriguez with an all star cast, over the top action stunts, an actor you just love to root for in action movies Danny Trejo, and some racist language plus the cars bouncing up and down on the road as they are driven.  As for myself I personally enjoyed every moment of this movie some parts laughing so hard my gut hurt, they action scenes thinking oh yeah slice those guys up make them pay.  Though a few scenes went way over the top (spoilers) like a prist with shotguns in his hands, then nail to the cross, then one actor with a Machete in his belly saying \\"oh this is nothing.\\" Then goes head and slices his own belly back forth until he dies.  But don't believe what everyone says about this movie, buy it for yourself and make up your own mind if you like it or not.  I got it for 7 dollars on amazon, and worth every dollar,  and come oct 4th is Machete Kills the sequal to Machete.  So in closing if you need a movie with action, drama, some comedy one liners then this is the movie for you buy it now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun,yet it gets very challenging. You will get addicted on the first few levels. If you like a time passer this will have you for hours on end.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle and tried it out, after downloading the appropriate program for my PC as well. Once I signed up for the free service and identified my computer on the Kindle, everything worked great! There is even an on screen hint at the beginning that shows you how to use it. It takes a bit of practice, but it works. Videos are smooth, music plays well, and pictures look excellent. Highly recommended. It even lets you set a password for extra security when you log on.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved the incredible imagination of Neil Gaiman, I wish we could learn more about these characters, as this novel is very short. worth reading again.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I absolutely love Bruno Mars and his latest album is phenomenal! I don't buy albums or songs most of the time, but I broke down and got Unorthodox Jukebox. The songs are fun and modern, some with an old-time aura to it. There's not a song on the album that I don't not enjoy listening to. If you're a fan of Bruno, it's a no brainer. If you're a pop/r&b fan, it's a great buy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is really great and the fact that you can defeat vector or meena is cool.You can also enter the laboratory or the street gru lives in ,it also lets connect to Facebook what will they come up with next?:)  (I don't usually five star games)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely loved the series so far!  Beautiful Scenery - Very entertaining - Great Watch ! Can't wait for Season 4 !
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|.Im in love im mean im truly in love with this game i would tell everybody to try this game..This is a great game
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thorough<br />Y enjoyed this story.  New story concept that really sucked me in.  Great teen novel. Can't wait for sequel
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's hard to get stars on certain levels and who has the money to keep paying for more? What more is there to say?
0385349947|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and took away a lot of valuable points.  It does get a bit repetitive, especially towards the end.  I am single and I do not have any children, so there were parts that did not apply to me.  I'm also not as high up in my career as Ms. Sandberg so I probably cannot ask for some of the things she has (nor do I necessarily need to at this point).  That said, the book still gave me a lot to think about, especially when interacting with other coworkers (both male and female).  This book is definitely an appropriate read for women starting or early in their career.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|Fun musical, was worried it would be a real oldie, was pleasantly surprised it has many current actors and was entertaining.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Pinball Deluxe Free. I always enjoyed bowling and like this on my Kindle. It is a good pastime game to play.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This was recommended by some friends a lot given away in the trailers but enjoyed the show and of course the music.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I Didn't read this book, but my wife did and told me that she thought it was a good story.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This product was shipped extremely quickly, but the cd case was cracked. No damage was done to the cd however and it worked perfectly well.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Slow, boring, and confusing.  Great cast with a terrible story.  The plot never really came together.  When it came to action there just wasn't enough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|makes you figure out the puzzle, you never stop thinking what's next! just when you think you've got it figured out ham a new surprise!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is s really fun  I like the way the girls help you and you can battle vector and meena
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I enjoy the variety, concise, brief topic choices.  The way I can access to listen or choose specific topics to share with kids in a limited time and initiate thought and opinions from them. Its a wonderful treat.  I am sharing with friends.
B001I9WK14|5.0|In all versions, this compilation of various live performances, band interviews, and on location shoots is an absolute masterpiece.  I may even go so far as to say this is U2's magnum opus.  With songs spanning a number of albums including Rattle & Hum and Joshua Tree, even the most casual U2 fan will be familiar with some of the tunes, while the most fanatic will appreciate them all.<br /><br />My personal favorite is the haunting Van Diemen's Land which is actually one of the few songs by U2 sung by The Edge.  It is both beautiful and tragic; haunting yet melodic.  The footage from the making of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" filmed at a church in Harlem is moving and thought provoking, and the scenes with B.B. King are priceless.<br /><br />In perhaps the most political performance I've ever seen Bono perform, the version of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" presented here is absolute perfection.  The contrast of the film going from B&W to color makes the whole thing just that much better.<br /><br />From Bullet the Blue Sky:<br /><br />This guy comes up to me<br />His face red like a rose on a thorn bush<br />Like all the colors of a royal flush<br />And he's peeling off those dollar bills<br />Slapping them down<br />One hundred, two hundred<br />And I can see those fighter planes<br />And I can see those fighter planes<br />Across the mud huts where the children sleep<br />Through the alleys of a quiet city street<br />You take the staircase to the first floor<br />Turn the key and slowly unlock the door<br />As a man breathes into a saxophone<br />And through the walls you hear the city groan<br />Outside is America<br />Outside is America
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love downtown Abbey. I hope that there will be a fourth season. When will we know about this new season.
0316228532|3.0|I think it's quite interesting that the general critical consensus about Rowling's _The Casual Vacancy_ is that it's not fun. I quite disagree, there were parts of the book I very much enjoyed reading. It is because of this I call it \\"OK\\" rather than saying I outright disliked it. The problems inherent to the story are that it's just not very well written. I adored the Harry Potter books and thought that it was marvelous to have the chance to watch a writer grow in confidence over the course of a series--the books went from being relatively awkwardly paced but wonderfully imagined (the first), to confident, detailed, gripping, well-plotted texts. None of this confidence is on display in this novel. Full of point of view lapses that may be failed attempts to move the story cinematically but end up making the writing seem a touch amateurish, the story is ponderous, riddled with holes, and leaves a lot of the more powerful ideas it sets up early on unresolved or unexplored before ending predictably, leaving the reader lost as to the intent of the tale. As the novel unfolds, it becomes more of an understated soap opera than a piece of literary fiction. It's unfortunate, as the book starts wonderfully, creating a vividly painted imagery of the town the book is set up to study, but then relies on cliched character and setting work that, in the end, tells more of a non-story than that fascinating one it promised from the start.<br /><br />Is this the death knell of J.K. Rowling's writing career? Of course not, it's just not a very good attempt at moving into the adult realism. Like with the Harry Potter books (sans the literary magic that made the first one so readable despite being episodic and a little clumsy), I expect that her obvious talents will grow with each book. This one *is* worth reading, it's just not very rewarding. It's place in history, I trust, will be as a stepping stone toward what Rowling will come to share with us.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|\\"Electric\\" by Pet Shop Boys is a satisfying song collection of electronica and synth pop type hits. There is something for many people on \\"Electric\\" and the musical style points to how the Pet Shop Boys are getting even better. \\"Axis\\", \\"Love Is A Bourgeois Construct\\",\\"Flourescent\\", \\"The Last To Die\\", \\"Thursday\\" (feat. Example), and \\"Vocal\\" are among the phenomenal tracks included in \\"Electric\\".  I have had the chance to watch their \\"Vocal\\" music video which is also superb. \\"Electric\\" by Pet Shop Boys is an excellent music feature for casual fans, diehard Pet Shop Boys fans, and/or those who enjoy elements of synth-pop and electronic music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game caused just enough frustration to make me push myself. I found myself choosing to play instead of a popular sweet app!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My three daughters and the neighbor boy all love this game. They made me download it to my tablet, my husbands, and thiers.<br />I haven't actually played it but from what I've seen the graphics look nice and the kids love the ponies. Some you have to buy with rubies I think in which you have to actually purchase for real money but some you can get with normal game play.<br /><br />Its a free app and worth it in my opinon.<br />There is always the option to purchase extra coins or rubies for extra stuff.<br />Keeps the kids entertained on trips and keeps them from fighting until the batteries get too low.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|i love it, good story, good bit of fiction, nice and short, makes you think and that's about it for now
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. It keeps you guessing and is addicting. Some things don't make sense, though. Download this game, for sure!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|You must download this game! It is fun and challenging for all ages. Everyone who sees you play it winds up getting it too do they can compete against you.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|All the hubbub about how beautifel the women were in this movie peeked my interest.<br />I had just seen A Perfect Ending on OUT tv and loved it,so I thought I would buy<br />Elena Undone sight un seen ( which I almost never do ).<br />This movie has a very stale plot.Housewife wants to sample forbidden fruit.Despite the worn plot it still held my interest.<br />Here's my question,where's the passion ? I saw plenty of desire in this movie,but<br />almost no passion. Two women who are ACHING to get together usually,for the first<br />time,can't move fast enough to get their clothes off.Here, we get this airy,fairy,<br />dead slow seduction scene.Simply not believable.<br />If you want to see anticipation,desire and passion, see A Perfect Ending.Again it's<br />about a straight married women wanting to walk on the wild side.<br />Despite the seemingly negative tone of my review my interest was kept because of<br />the dialogue.Ms.Conn did not hit a single discordant note throughout the entire movie. That alone was worth the price of admission,as they say.<br />About the acting,Mary Wells was very believable<br />and enjoyable as the best friend.Necar Zedagan never seemed to show an ounce of passion.<br />I always felt as if she was standing on the sidelines watching here own reactions and not getting too involved.Acting involves a hell of a lot more than posing for<br />a picture.<br />I can't give a proper review of Traci Dinwiddie because she is so-o-o stunning<br />that I didn't care what she did.I do however wish she would have smiled more<br />when she had the chance.She lights up the screen like a beacon with that smile.<br />What's the chance of seeing either of these two actresses again in a lesbian<br />movie? Slim to none.Why is that? Why can't lesbians have a favourite lesbian movie<br />star? Not going to happen in my life time.
B0063M22QO|3.0|i played before and a restaurant gaming machine one time and had a blast. I play this one and i get bored really easily with it. I guess its not my cup of tea anymore.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Like a good book I couldn't put it down until I solved the mystery. Well worth the money. Great graphics and an excellent story line kept my attention. I did need the hints occasionally.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The cast is fabulous.....love the acting, esp the guest stars.  Writing excellent and great job on the plot...keeps me coming back for more.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Again the time indicator on the Kindle is small, so this helps!  The 24 hours clock keeps me in practice.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|We loved the movies and were really excited to play the new Minion Rush.  Unfortunately, while the game shows up on the Kindle Fire HD, it tries to load then exits.  Something is wrong with this app. Don't waste your time with it.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Enjoyed reading book.  It was a reminder of the scriptures that tells us to love and to give.  Everything in life  is based on the principle of seed time and harvest.  Plant good seeds and you receive a good harvest. Give and it will be given back to you are instructions from God and his love.  He gave his only begotten Son, Jesus and whomever receive  him will have eternal life.  I am grateful for the simplistic truths for life.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Simple concept that is very well designed and implemented. Graphics are retro, but improved to have a very modern look and feel. Gameplay is very addictive and story is fun. I spent many hours playing this game when I should have been doing things like working :)
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|After reading this book, you will never view money the same way again! T. Harv Eker opened up the portal to financial freedom. Salute!
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I was feeling a little sad so read the 8th in the Stephanie Plum sagas. Never fails to make me laugh and what she get herself into. A surprise Ranger happening, hint, hint, but we all know she truly loves Joe. A good read for a good laugh, not the worst or the best, but a good laugh is still worth it. I take breaks but will read all 19 books.
B007WT135S|5.0|I've seen and read interviews with Keith and learned that he's a lot less crazy and a lot more intelligent than he's portrayed in the press.  He's very honest about his misfortunes and mistakes in life, as were Eric Clapton and Gregg Allman in their books.  What comes through is a very three-dimensional and warm human being who has led an unusually interesting life.  As far as reading the book goes, it's very well-written, an easy and comfortable read, and damned hard to put down.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I love this show.  It's one of my favorite movies and cracks me up.  Got this for my 4-year old and we watch it constantly!
B005ES0XVO|5.0|At first I thought they were too large.  Since I wore them, they are just right.  This model has a great bottom for non slip and are sturdy and without the loss of comfort.  I am very pleased.
0547391005|5.0|My 4-year old loves Curious George and we monopolize the library books when we check them out.  So I bought this book to help appease her love.  I didn't realize it came with an audio CD of each story.  We listen to it in the car and she loves it! Great product and very happy with the purchase!
B00C6Q6OAG|3.0|The face make up was crooked and the hair on one of them was awful. Please Mattel have better quality control.
B004NS710C|5.0|denzel and chris pine and a 40 ton locomotive....a fine pairing of actors and machines....a prophetic film...good ending here,bad ending in quebec.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is an odd story.  It's actually multiple stories . The overall theme of the book is odd but the details are nice and normal.  Leave it to gaiman to take the reader on such a roller coaster fun ride.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hands down the best period drama production. Casts are amazing!! Story line grabs your every nerve and excites you with unexpected development.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies is a pretty good series.  It is different in many ways but entertaining.  It is fun to watch and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat  I really enjoy watching this series and when I am watching it I want to keep on going.  I give this series 5 stars.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|The promotional material for this reboot stated, \\"The most terrifying film you will ever experience.\\" The hyperbole alone should have warned me trouble was ahead. If you're a fan of the original, I can't see how this won't disappoint expectations. I realize that both films should be considered separate entities, but I'm not sure how realistic that is when you're a fan of the first version. The basic premise remains, but the gonzo film-making of the first is replaced with smooth, moneyed production that--similar to many modern horror flicks--asks audiences to suspend much too much disbelief. I'm tired of the \\"super hero\\" everyman who can be beaten with a crowbar or shot senseless by a nail gun or have his/her hand amputated...and still come back bouncy and defiant. In an effort to not give anything away, all I can say that if I weren't decided before the last two characters were left, I certainly was from that point onward. A ridiculous ending that neither satisfies nor chills. If you haven't seen Sam Raimi's 1981 flick, you might enjoy this. For me, it was a definite case of lunch bag letdown.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|after I've paid to remove ads,  I can no longer log on. everytime I launch,  I end up with a pop-up that says &quot;fake welcome page&quot; and can't go beyond it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Starring the woman that inspired the Duck Sauce hit. Light, wholesome, feel-good comedy. Watch it with your mom or siblings!
B00C1C123E|3.0|like the first movie, the special effects are excellent (although a little dated by today's standards).  however, unlike the first movie, the story has too many parts that are too far-fetched even for a movie about dinosaurs...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS AN AMAZING APP! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE MOVIES DESPICABLE ME. IT IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN BUY THINGS USING ACTUAL MONEY, THERE ARE STILL MANY WAYS TO GET THEM JUST BY DOING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE GAME. IT HAS GIVING ME SOMETHING TI DO AND COUNTINUES TO DO IT. PLUS I LOVE THE MINIONS AND THERE COSTUMES.
0812974611|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  I especially enjoyed meeting Pliny the elder.  I thought the character of Ampliatus was drawn very well.  I, for one, was never bored reading it and I  have great admiration for the author, his scholarship and his ability to create an interesting fictional structure and description of this piece of history.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I like it you can go high levels i like that I can design a tank I like I enjoy playing
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I bought this item and it only worked a month before it started messing up!! Do not get this item!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show is slow at times, but the story is great and so is the acting. It's like the book you can't put down. The only bad part is there are only 10 episodes per season. I'd like to see twice that!
B003VR5PPY|3.0|I bought this game because of some of the reviews I read from different video game magazines and websites, I just do not agree with them, the game is very tedious, when trying to solve a puzzle, lets say opening a locked brief case to get an item you need, you need to search a room for clues, navigating the rooms is cumbersome at best but my problem is every time you go back to a puzzle you have to read the instructions for the puzzle, so I am just tapping the screen over and over again just to play the game. I think there should be an option to skip the instructions but there is not. Not only is there a lot of mindless tapping(it also progresses the story), there is also item examination for which the controls are just plain crap, it took me a whole minute to look at the back of a picture. The puzzles can be clever, tough and require some thinking, that and the excellent writing (lots of reading required) is where the three stars come from. The graphics are o.k. the rooms are rendered and the story characters are drawn (not animated) and you get to see them along with the text of the story, there is minimal voice acting. I have not finished the game but would only recommend it to someone who loves puzzles or excellent story telling, considering the difficult controls and repetitive gameplay I do not think this game is for everyone
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I liked good movies before liking good movies was cool.  Haha I have this bad attitude where I don't think I'll like the most popular movies of the year even though I'm a pretty normal dude- but we loved it.  and Ms. Lawrence is a babe-er-ella.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. Me and my daughter play this together all the time. I wish it was easier to get gems and coins.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great dramatic storyline with really good actors.  From episode to episode it keeps you interested for the next twist and turn.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|The game can get repetitive, but once you adjust for the speed of the game ... you can have some fun. I spent a few hours on it, but with my short attention span.. I moved on.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|Barbra can do just about anything.  Seth and Barbra worked well together. Great chemistry! Just had to buy the movie to see it again.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Nice case for your phone, nice quality, even works as a speaker stand. I would recommend this for someone looking for a case and a stand in one.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love Morgan Freeman so decided to watch this movie.  It was wonderful.  The interaction between the actors was great.  The dialogue was humorous and the action fast.  The special effects were outstanding.<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire movie.  I will also be heading out to see Red 2.
B002MRW0UC|4.0|This is another great  book by John Steinbeck. It took a long time to be delivered but worth the wait. You are in for a treat if you take the time to read it. Enjoy~
B0064X7FVE|1.0|why fix something that wasn't broken? Now missing the UV index. Maps no longer can overlap clouds with radar. have uninstalled app.
B009KCUX3S|5.0|All the important things about Java was explained in a very pedagogical way. Working my way through the book was extremely fun and addictive. I am forever grateful to those how made this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. I love looking for the power ups and knocking down the other minions. It reminds me of Temple Run.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Its Star Wars, Who doesn't love it. They did add some scenes that weren't in the original which made it seem a bit odd for those of us who went to see the them in the late 70s early 80s but it is Star Wars.
B0012UNWJ8|4.0|This movie was very intriguing informational educational. I would recommend this movie to everybody with a family and kids that like chess very educational for chess players and entertaining at the same time.
159463176X|2.0|I was so fond of Hosseini's first two books that I couldn't wait for the release of this one. His writing is beautiful,as always ,but so disjointed that I found myself trying to figure out who he was talking about at times. He left me with questions about some of the characters that were introduced. it is not to the standard of his other stories.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|From the moment I started level 1, I was hooked. While some of the clues were easy, others were a real challenge. That's what made the game so good.  Would definitely recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun for my two year old. I can't get him off. thanks for creating it. awesome
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and my husband loved it. I would recommend it. One more to add to the collection.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is so simply and beautifully written. I've grown up with the movie and can honestly say I'm so happy to have finally read it. The writing is so different from anything I've ever read before, it reads like a fairy tale almost and flows in such a way that you just can't put it down. Loved it.
B0053O89WY|4.0|The boyfriend and I (as well as our friends) all relate to at least one character on &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;  We love this show!  It's awesome when you can totally GET the humor, and the references- Whether it's Star Trek, Comic Book, Science, etc.  It's a winner every time we watch it.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I so enjoyed the first two of the trilogy.  The ending was disappointing unless a fourth book in the series is to be forthcoming.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|The boyfriend and I (as well as our friends) all relate to at least one character on &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;  We love this show!  It's awesome when you can totally GET the humor, and the references- Whether it's Star Trek, Comic Book, Science, etc.  It's a winner every time we watch it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Looking forward to the next series. Great acting and interesting story line. I've shared my DVD with several friends and all have enjoyed it.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors.  I am so glad that I bought this film.  It's absolutely fantastic.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Even though this book has hundreds of glowing reviews already, I feel it could still use more. I'm a sucker for clueless, sarcastic, overly-cocky, male characters. The kind that make you laugh, shock you, and manage to make you fall in love with them without even trying. This book had me smiling the whole time, even when things weren't looking so good for our sexy narrator. If you're looking for a fun read that you'll want to visit again, give this a shot. Tangled was one of the best purchases I've made, and I know I'll be re-visiting these characters while anticipating the next book in the series (high pitching squealing ensues)!
B000W91RUG|4.0|The boyfriend and I (as well as our friends) all relate to at least one character on &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;  We love this show!  It's awesome when you can totally GET the humor, and the references- Whether it's Star Trek, Comic Book, Science, etc.  It's a winner every time we watch it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is one of the best shows in history. Surprised the writing is as good as it is after ten years.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I put off watching this for a LONG time.  I have read all three of the books and seen all of the original (Swedish) films.  I wanted to give this film a chance because I adore Daniel Craig.  But goodness gracious everyone in this film MUMBLES SO MUCH!!!  We HAD to watch the film with subtitles, even with the volume up super high because we could hardly understand a word that Daniel Craig said.  BUT- Let me make myself clear, this is a good adaptation.  What the Swedish version left out from the book, this one added in.  So, between the two films you get a pretty good all-around adaptation.  I'm also not saying that the Swedish version is perfect- It's not.  However, I do feel as though it is ahead of this version because of the MUMBLING.<br /><br />Also, the intro with &#34;Immigrant Song&#34; by Trent Reznor and Karen O...  Freaking awesome.  I bought the song off iTunes shortly after watching the movie.  Awesome remake of the Led Zeppelin song!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but they have no flint and steel or enderman. I just love the game just so awesome.
B003L77G6A|4.0|The boyfriend and I (as well as our friends) all relate to at least one character on &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;  We love this show!  It's awesome when you can totally GET the humor, and the references- Whether it's Star Trek, Comic Book, Science, etc.  It's a winner every time we watch it.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|not an intuitive game, didn't like the 'shadow' graphics, it was hard to tell if something was a cloud or a pillow, a fish or a saw
B002N5N4M6|4.0|The boyfriend and I (as well as our friends) all relate to at least one character on &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;  We love this show!

B005544TRQ|5.0|It's a great show If you are a fan of law shows. But it's not like any other law show. What's better are the characters - smart, witty and glamorous. A must watch!
B00742BVW8|5.0|I first watched this film when I was in High School.  I am so glad that I bought it all these years later.  It never ceases to impress me.  Jet Li is great, and I always seem to have my breath taken away by the beauty of the cinematography.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever. I love it to hang out with my horse Mya I like how there is no adds!
B0064MT1FI|5.0|I love this film.  If you've never seen it, you should.  I am very happy that I am now able to add it to my DVD library!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As usual Mr.Gaiman does not disappoint. It's a wonderfully, ridiculously, fantastically imaginative novel. I  Will recommend that everyone everywhere should read this book once. If I was a tyrant my only rule would be to make people read this book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|great story teller & I think this is his best novel yet. I could not put it down and stayed up all night to read it.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Good movie but not for kids at all. Very funny. If you liked knocked up you will love this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! I've never read a book like this. The shocking twists were just that; shocking. I can't wait to read Losing Hope. This book will rock you to the core and bring out emotion you never knew you had. What a talented writer Hoover is.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Fantastic book, well worth the read. I've been absorbed in this series since the first book, and I love the writing style. Absolutely fantastic!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book sends a great message for kids and adults.  Different vantage points really sent the message home.  The message here can fit so many situations.  Take the time to read this STORY not just the words.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is awesome starting from shampooing then makeup to maching her purse I love it it has everything great game.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This was a masterful movie. The acting was amazing. Shot for shot it was artistic and stylistic. The drama and action will have you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire movie. My only real beef is, for a zombie movie, they sure don't seem to have that much to do with zombies. Sure there are hordes in the streets in the beginning. Hordes in Jerusalem, a small handful in the WHO building, but they don't seem to have much actual focus on them. This is purely my opinion. I personally would have liked to see more direct zombie action, especially in the set up. I thought the WHO action was perfect. I just think with such amazing...everything else...5-10 more minutes of zombie carnage...VISIBLE zombie carnage...not horde trampling zombie carnage, could have really added the last little \\"horror\\" aspect that I personally felt was missing. Again, I think the movie was phenominal, this is just a zombie horror movie fans opinion on what I think could have made it just a little bit better. Still if you are looking for a little less gory, more...tame...pg-13 horror film, this is an absolute must. You can not miss with this movie!
B008N9AASC|5.0|This film gives an unblinking glimpse at the wide spectrum of activity happening on the planet on which we all live.  In all it's beauty and horror, this movie opens eyes, minds, and hearts—a must see for anyone who is a human being.
B006LXQID8|4.0|Our French teacher suggested we view this film to help with learning pronunciation.  It was a good film for that purpose and I enjoyed the storyline.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting and writing always waiting to see what happens next.. Good snapshot of  life  during wartime and its effects on the wealthy.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book a couple of years ago, and felt that the movie did it justice. The characters were in sync with the book.  Glad that the killings were not too gory.  Would see it again to pick up on more nuances that I may have missed.
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|I love scary movies but most can't surprise me this one made me jump several times. A must see for anyone who likes scary movies.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I have read this book 3 times and am sure I will read it again. This book is definitely one for those who love books and stories that have substance.  You will not be disappointed.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The performances by the all star cast are only outdone by the classic story telling and character development of the author. This film brings the Braodway stage into your home with Hollywood style. Best of all, it's appealing even to those who don't count themselves as lovers of musicals.  Don't miss this classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is an excellent way to keep kids entertained. It is free and I think it is amazing. Take it from me,I'm 11  I know what kids like.  LOL
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was happy that I was able to get this movie at such a great price. Amazon always has a good selection of inexpensive movies.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Fun game, difficult but enjoyable. I like the way that it is like a takeoff of the magic card game.
B002RRWWQ4|4.0|One of my more favorite of the Potter flicks with a big build up of suspense for the final two movies.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is much better than the movie.  If you love the movie, you'll love the book.  There are differences between the movie and the book and I think the book puts what's in the movie in perspective.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Entertaining movie that can get a bit slow at times. The acting is ok, but the dog steals the show.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I always love Neil Gaiman's imagination.  In this book he seems to be reminiscing in a fashion.  I enjoyed the child-like wonder of it all but it just left me with a feeling of &#34;is that all there is?&#34;  Also, to be noted, a very short book.  I know the critics are praising this book but it just wasn't one of his better ones in my humble opinion.
B00992CF6W|2.0|One word noooooo!<br />I loved the game before the update involving realms no more multiplayer<br />Why?!?!?!?<br />I loved multiplayer but now???<br />I would had gave this game 5 stars but now I'll like to give it 2 stars.
B00BQQM262|4.0|One of my favorites for story, character, voice acting (who doesn't love Eartha Kitt?), humor for all ages, and a host of memorable lines.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Tried this on a whim, and it is a lot of fun. Fling your monkey around!  It's super silly monkey hijinks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love playing this game.  Makes my brain work! Keeps me alert and always thinking about the previous moves that I made.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its so much fun. It is so addictive to me. But at first it downloads very slowly and when you want to goto the home page of the game it takes like thirty seconds. Its fun but it has to be moving just a little faster than ot is already.
B003TH14H4|5.0|This is the sort of series I could own, and do, which is saying a lot. The characters are great, even when they fall flat on their face they'll get up again and there is usually someone who is there to help them.  The lack of swearing is a refreshing change.
0316010669|5.0|My son loves this book SO much that he licked the cover! If you enjoyed The Tipping Point and Outliers, yer gonna like and maybe lick this one too! :p
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Clean humor even when suggestive and the language not used makes this a great family show for all ages.  Characters are real and likeable plus given room to expand.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game that my kids and myself enjoy playing!! We are enjoying it immensely and can't wait to see how far we can get!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|luv it so much got to try this people<br /><br />man oh its so cool because Puget to to go how much level u want

B002QRWJA4|5.0|One of the best shows for 25 yrs! Would love for it to come back to broadway for another run.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put these books down. It took me two weeks to read all three books and I wish they didn't end!!!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Easy to read and get hooked in. Not to much about the Steampunk lifestyle as it is about the romance, but lots of good action and a great story line!
031606792X|5.0|I have read the entire twilight Saga collection, and the Breaking Dawn was by far the most intriguing one of all, Love Stephanie Meyers.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Although released in 1958, this story of mistaken identity, romance and interesting plot twists deserves its reputation as a classic Hitchcock thriller and is still fun to see and enjoy.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Great set! I bought the set for my dad for Father's Day, he really loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes zz top
B00992CF6W|5.0|This takes loneger to update to the next version<br />hey could improve that thats the inly downsde of this app<br />Other wise it great
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|It takes a while to figure out what constitutes a match if they aren't identical pictures.  But then it clicks.  As you get it correct, the game automatically gets more challenging.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have trouble sleeping but this helped me get to sleep at night when I couldn't before. love how u can layer the sounds
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|I test all my childs apps after purchase so shed not experiencing issues.<br /><br />I was repairing the chair and once it was painted it froze. Please update or give me a refund. It's basically unplayable and buggy for me.<br /><br />UPDATE* 8-7-13<br /><br />Still no content on any of the panda games I've owned, no updates, no fixes, I have come to the conclusion panda games look cute but are defective, full of bugs and lack in features and the developers abandoning the game and not replying to issues I've had with thier other games is completely bad customer service, Let this be a warning to you all.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was so good I nearly read it in a single night!! I might have been put off by the opening chapter when vulgar language appeared right out of the gate. I would definitely rate this book PG-13 or NC-17. However, its literary credit far outweighs the occasional string of expletives. I found the characters highly unusual and the format of the book very refreshing bordering on surprising. The dream-like atmosphere of the circus described in the narrative is likewise experienced in &#34;turning&#34; each page through cleverly placed divisions and wiley titles. The aura of mystery combined with a sharp sense of comedy at once reminded me of Lemony Snickett's Series of Unfortunate Events though on an adult level. I recommend this book to all readers, specifically those who enjoyed Water for Elephants, The Great Gatsby, or Chocolat. No spoiler alerts here, but the book is not written for a sequel. Enjoy while you can... the circus is here tonight and may be gone tomorrow.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have finally joined the throng who love this program - late coming but I couldn't love it more. Wanted to stay up all night to finish watching the entire season. Wonderful acting by best performers. Can hardly wait to begin watching season 3! Maggie Smith awesome as always.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Very entertaining and easy to read! Kind of makes you think of how easy a cover up could possibly be, lol
B00BESM14U|3.0|I think this is a very good movie but I can only give it three stars because I expected more comedy and a less serious theme.  I guess I must have missed something in the reviews I read beforehand.
B0037Z8SLI|5.0|Who would have thought that checklists could be so interesting? Moreover have a book written about them :). Not me. After reading it, I feel the urge to incorporate checklists in my aspects of life. Atul Gawande did a great job writing this book. His style of writing captivating and effortless.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I saw the movie, read the book, then watched the movie again.  I can't say why I liked the movie's ending better without spoiling it for others, so I won't be specific.<br /><br />Good thriller.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This sharpener works great and the small size makes it easy to bring with you in case you need it.  It can easily sharpen standard blades as well as serrated blades quickly and easily which is a great feature.  Most sharpeners Ive seen don't have the ability to sharpen a serrated blade like this one.  You can't go wrong with this sharpener if you ask me.
B007R0XF3U|3.0|Though I didn't particularly like Madonna in the 80's, I do think she had pushed the boundaries for women and, in some ways, actually been a good example for girls.  How many songs state that if &#34;he doesn't appreciate you, you're better off on your own.&#34;  However, I really got tired of Madonna and her entourage discussing sex all the time.  I'm not a prude but there are more things in life.  I kind of wished I saw her reading a book but that wouldn't make a good video.
B004M8S440|5.0|Georgette H eyeris 2nd to none in her knowledge of the people & customs of the regency period. Venetia is a charming example.
140006922X|5.0|I can't think of a book whose text I've highlighted more than Reza Aslan's fascinating new biography, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.\\" There are so many incredible points I'd never thought about, so many new takes on this 2000+ year-old story.<br /><br />First off, this is not a debunking of Jesus Christ. It's neither blasphemy nor sacrilege. The author, in his foreword, proclaims his Christianity. Still, this book might still make some devout Christians uncomfortable, even angry. Read it anyway. There is much to be learned.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is the product of over twenty years of research, and Reza Aslan's well-researched and documented theories are like nothing I've ever read.<br /><br />There are three basic areas of focus. First, he examines the Jewish world near the dawn of the First Century C.E. Jesus of Nazareth was not the only messiah walking around back then. There were dozens, all of them claiming to be the son of God, performing miracles, and preaching to big crowds. It's not like Jesus turned thirty, then began doing something nobody else had been doing.<br /><br />John the Baptist was different, preaching charity and humanity. He baptized people in the Jordan, regardless of whether they were rich or poor. There was no charge at all. More on that in a minute.<br /><br />When Jesus came to be baptized by John the Baptist, He stood in line like everyone else. When John baptized him, there wasn't a clap of thunder, a voice calling down from heaven, or a dove appearing out of nowhere. What happened was that Jesus became one of John the Baptist's disciples for a period.<br /><br />When Jesus began his ministry, He was considered just another preaching exorcist/magician wandering around Galilee. However, there was one big difference with Jesus: He didn't charge for his miracles. Not a cent. The other roving \\"Messiahs\\" charged a lot.<br /><br />The second part of Aslan's book deals with the cozy relationship between the Jewish High Priestsand the Roman governors. Jerusalem was the center of Judaism, and the Romans tolerated it--even welcomed it--as long as it kept the people in line. At Passover and other High Holy Days, Jews flocked to Jerusalem. The outer parts of the huge temple complex were filled with vendors selling sacrificial animals. The High Priest took a cut of everything the temple made, and he lived like a king.<br /><br />One thing the Jewish High Priest never failed to do was make an arrangement with the reigning Roman governor, who also got a taste of the profits. Thus, it became doubly valuable for the governor to allow Judaism's continued practice.<br /><br />Jesus and his band of disciples--all of them essentially illiterate peasants and day laborers--stuck to the smaller towns and villages for most of His travels. Gradually, word got out that Jesus of Nazareth could heal the sick, and He spoke of a new kingdom to come. His reputation grew until He had His Biblically documented triumphant ride into Jerusalem for Passover.<br /><br />And Jesus did go a little Old Testament on the temple. He overturned the loan-sharks' tables, freed the sacrificial animals, and yelled at those who dared defile the temple. The Jewish elders tried and convicted Jesus, and the penalty for his actions was death by stoning. The Romans had a rule about that--no Jewish executions. Because Jesus was preaching about a new world order (for lack of a better term), Jesus was tried and convicted by the Romans, who sentenced Him to be crucified for sedition. The big trial in front of Pontius Pilate?<br /><br />If Jesus and Pilate were even in the same room, it's likely Pilate just wrote Jesus's name down on an official scroll, and sent him on to Golgotha. The hand-washing thing? Offering a choice between Jesus and Barrabas? Pilate having a change of heart?<br /><br />Lovely fiction.<br /><br />The final part of Aslan's book--and a mindblower for me--was his discussion of early Christianity, specifically the completely different stories told by the Apostles and the newly minted Christian, Paul.<br /><br />Paul's version of Christ's ministry was very different from what the Apostles remember. Paul added all the magic and showmanship, the drama and melodrama, things many of which never happened.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" read almost like an adventure. Unlike some histories, I fought to find time to read it. It was that beautifully written and fascinating.<br /><br />What Reza Aslan has done is challenge that much of Christianity is based on a Christ who never existed. BUT, the Jesus who DID exist was a spectacular, wonderfully inspired man worth every bit of adulation He receives.<br /><br />Most Highly Recommended<br /><br />(nb: I received an advance review copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley)
B00DU74U74|3.0|I only give it three stars because I read the book way before the idea of a movie and loved the book.<br />It was good and I would recommend it to fans of the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the splendor and the drama of the Era. That said, I really hate it when great actors decide to leave-permanently.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I'm a huge fanboy for the original Sam Raimi trilogy, believe me, me and my friend, who is also a good fan of the franchise, went to the premiere at night hoping to get disturbed and exhilarated, and boy we were...<br />See, I've been reading a lot of negative and mediocre reviews on why a lot of people consider this movie inferior or not up to par with the original.<br /><br />The main complaints from \\"original fans\\" that I saw:<br /><br />- Lack of Bruce Campbell or the character of Ash<br />- Lack of a humorous tone<br />- Stupid decisions of the main characters<br /><br />All those 3 are fair, sure, but still don't really make a lot of sense to me. The characters in the original movie had no motivation not to be alarmed at Cheryl's grotesque physical changes, in the new film it's understandable why the characters still stick with Mia since they believe is due to her drug problem, making the characters in the reboot more fleshed out than the ones in the original.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure if Sam Raimi would have had a big budget like Fede Alvarez had, the cheapness and campy feel to the movie would have been removed in order to bring a frantic and gory horror movie like no one else had seen before. I appreciate both tones, but if we're talking about horror, the reboot takes it out of the park.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, these characters are more fleshed out and indeed do make stupid decisions, but compared to the decisions made by the original characters, they're far gone from being mediocre; although David's girlfriend is kind of forgettable<br /><br />****SPOILERS****<br /><br />This reboot does justice to the original, with many tip off the hat references to the original trilogy, mostly the original film and plays it cool by changing certain situations to different characters that fans will stil get. Sure, Bruce Campbell would have been a nice addition, but like in the original, there's a small cast because there's supposed to be a feeling of isolation, and we do get to see Bruce Campbell for a little bit after the credits saying his classic line \\"Groovy\\" which made me and my friend geek out at the movie theater. Fede Alvarez does an excellent job directing and his use of practical effects instead of CGI works wonders as you feel the horror to be real and disturbing.<br /><br />Being a huge Evil Dead fan I do think is a little unfair giving this movie 5 stars, but I do only because I encourage everyone to go and buy and support the film makers that made this remake happen<br /><br />I give the Evil Dead remake a 4.7 out of 5.
B008S80PCE|5.0|It is by far a great deal for the music givin.<br />Epic buy and a blessed band. Funkalishiouseness and 4 thumbs up!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is the bomb. Build up your base and  you also<br />can attack other online players or the campaign.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|I LOVE Jeremy Renner...and would see him in anything...but this was a bit much.  I don't identify with him in a fairy tale role.  Even if that role involves guns and violence.  I expected him to revert to his Bourne Legacy personna....and he does.  Same anger on his face....for witches.  It was hard to watch this...but...Jeremy.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|It gives you lots of formations to play but its kinda one note.  You will win every game and the object is to do it more quickly and get a better time.  You are up against others who are doing the same.  I just was looking for a standard Mahjong game that challenges you and that you don't necessarily win.  This was not it... but its ok to play when you are looking for a time waster.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|All you do is fly around doing nothing and shoot lasers at weak enemies do not download its a waste of space thank you &lt;&deg;_&deg;&gt;
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is for all the dog lovers out there. It is funny, sad and a quick summer read. Made me see my dog in a totally different light. Fun.
B009PLKCEE|4.0|Overall works well.<br />Sometimes it crashes when rewinding and when paused doesn't not resume.<br /> This is within another app, es file explorer, so that could be the problem but it should work even when playing videos within a file browser.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good effort by Grisham.  A few twists and turns that you have to pay attention to.  As usual gives an insite into the &#34;legal&#34; profession.
B000089RV6|5.0|This is definitely one of the best hard rock albums ive ever heard! Not one bad track on here. This is amazing considering a new lead singer was at the helm. Check it out!
0307595579|5.0|Oh, Stieg Larsson, you died too soon...<br />An amazing trilogy from and even more amazing individual. Wish that there were more :(
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was so fun to play. It actually kept me interested. I would recommend this game. It was way better than 100 floors. Would like to see more floors.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|&#34;Psycho&#34; has and always will be one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE horror films by legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. When we were kids (and through our teenage years) would always order Pizza Huts stuffed crust pepperoni pizza, sit on the floor in our pj's and happily watch Psycho from beginning to end. Something that we STILL DO to this day and we are in our twenties :).
B008M721MS|5.0|I can talk to family, friends on the go this is excellent when I am not at my desk top.
B008M721MS|5.0|having this app on my kindle was great. the interface is just like the computer verison and just as easy to use.
B000002NAK|5.0|Soundtrack as good as the movie.  One of the greatest musicals of this generation.  Andrew Lloyd Webber outdid himself with this movie soundtrack and the Phantom of the Opera.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|For the young crowd. They will love it. Kept the kids quite and real happy for awhile. Buy it for your kids.
6304806418|5.0|We are not a great fan of Madonna but she did a fabulous job portraying Evita.  One of the best musicals of this generation.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Entertaining. Worth the 4.99. Why do I need to write 16 more words?  This is totally stupid and the last time I will write a review.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Really enjoy this series. Is there going to be more from Harry Hole...?? I hope so..!! Definitely worth trying this author and meeting this main character.
080701429X|5.0|The lessons learned in this book changed my life. As part of an independent research project I did in college many years ago on perceptions and emotion, I was assigned this book. The story was sad, but the lesson was uplifting and empowering. Twenty years later, I still think about this book and ordered myself a copy to keep in my library. Well worth the read!
B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of my most favorite movies of all time. Love kicking some alien butt. Lol<br />Just makes you wonder are we alone ?
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is very different from the movie, but it's definitely a quick, easy read. Very entertaining and also funny.
0425263924|4.0|Not sure why so many people are disappointed in this series.  I find it hot and suspenseful.  It does pain me to watch these 2 have to keep going through the turmoil but isn't that part of what keeps you wanting more.  Yes it could end with this book but why?  There are some much needed answers.  I will read the next one and make up my mind if I'll read the 5th one.  Sylvia Day did say the last 2 are Gideon's POV.  That excites me.  The only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 is the length of time in between books.  Oh and I like getting to know other characters in the book that's what balances it all out.
B000002IO1|1.0|I am so disappointed...I wanted to hear Black Velvet!  I'm not sure what happened, but there is no information on this disc!  I received two other CDs in the same shipment, and they were fine.  I tried another PC...nothing.  It kept asking me to insert a disc!<br /><br />Please send me another one
B009WUBERW|3.0|Was fun to see many aging, macho superstuds together in the same movie, although it's difficult to mix comedy and action together  this flick managed to do both and remain enjoyable, even though the special effects were often over the top.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Omg i absolutly loved this book!  If u have to read it for school. Do so. This is a great book.  If u love the hunger games this is a great book for u ,it touches on the same thing! I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Because I have seen both of the first two seasons, I knew I would love this and the price is simply unbeatable!  I would recommend it to anyone.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|I am not sure why this got low ratings? This is a Sasha Baron Cohen movie... its going to be over the top, crass, shocking and HILARIOUS! He has out done himself this time. Talented man , funny movie!! Loved it.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|Very well written. Great character development.  Best role I've ever seen Will Ferrell in, and he barely cracks a smile.  It's not really even a comedy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved the game. My only criticism is that a little more general explanation at the beginning screen would be helpful.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like his earlier book, ECHOED kept me involved and opened up my eyes to the cultural differences in the area.
1476734941|5.0|Love this diet!  Lost 20 lbs. in 3 months and have kept it off for a month so far.  Would have been more except that on my 'off'' day I ate normally for me which meant way too many wheat products  (pizza, bread, cookies, cakes) so could gain as much as 4 lbs in a day!  If I cut back on wheat I can still have my favorite foods such as ice cream and candy and not see a weight gain.  Overall I feel this diet has me making much healthier choices, I feel so good and have gone down a size.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The 3rd book was good but a little anti-climatic at the end.  I expected a better ending than what it was but would suggest reading the Trilogy overall.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Who would not like Harrison Ford?<br />This version of the story is more realistic than the previous one with Humphry Bogart & William Holden, and Audrey Hepburn, that was a good film, but this one seems to have more &#34;oomph&#34;
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I'm a HUGE taylor swift fan and I got this album and literally listen to it everyday!  It never,ever gets old!  Totally reccomend!!  Lovelove love!!
B00CL50LEC|3.0|Good chick flick to watch with your girl. Story & acting was entertaining. Save the cash - wait for this on cable or netflix.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is actuallyba pretty entertaining game. It keeps my 19 year old together with my 6 year busy for a long time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I used this for a quick touch up on my camp knives and daily EDC knives. a couple pulls and your good to go. I would recommend for a touch up but not for a refinish or to repair chips!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I felt like I was sitting listening to Ellen's rhetoric and philosophy for living. She just makes me smile and laugh out loud.<br />She is genuine, simple, sweet and honest. I enjoy her books and her humor and just the kind of human being she appears to be.<br />I look forward to reading other books she has written as well.<br />Perfect reading for positive living, especially while going through cancer treatment, she lifts my Spirit to enjoy life in all its forms.<br />Nice going Ellen, keep writing and doing what you do Best / entertain and teach.
0345529057|5.0|Very inexpensive, decent quality and a great read.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it is mass printed so you get what you pay for. The words smear on the page with fingerprints but the book holds up if you take reasonable care.<br /><br />Would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!!! I really wish there were more levels! I had a hard time putting it down. Fun and challenging enough, but not to the point of frustration!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It can be a little brain twisting but it is fun. It gives you puzzles that you have to figure out in order to move on.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I really like this game. I would have given it a 5 but I'm only on level 3 and I'm already trapped.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is fun and realistic. I loved that I it let you feed and play with your horse. I also loved that you could train and treat your horse.
B000RVK1AQ|4.0|This one was good if you like this kind of stuff, action, motorcycles and bad dudes.<br /><br />But don't go for the sequel, it was awful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a adventure it's like  you are really there in district 12 it's so disruptive and its awesome
B00CW665VI|3.0|The premise is quite predictable and there were far too many sex chapters that did not advance the plot. Why was this rated 5 stars?  I was expecting much more and it did not deliver.  I am not interested in the sequel books.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|This GPS comes us USB connected with a long cord and suction cup. With a laptop on a boat, I prefer this to a blue tooth connection as it uses less of the laptops resources and battery.  The new SIRF 4 chipset allowed me to quickly acquire more than enough satellites even inside the cabin at the nav station and the location was very accurate.  My navigation programs had less difficulties identifying and connecting with this unit than any other.  I love the fact that it is weather proof and if necessary can be located outside in bad weather.
B00699SDR8|5.0|This was the second time through it. I read it first in an intro to philosophy class at the university of Sioux falls and I returned to the digital copy as a refresher.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. It keeps you thinking. I like how creative each room is and am looking forward to more levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game keeps logic going from one scene to the next.  good thinking game.  will recommend to friends and family and coworkers
B00422LESO|2.0|* SPOILER ALERT *<br /><br />I had some hopes for this book -- even as a light read I thought the premise was cute.  I enjoyed some of the details and the specific details of her time at \\"Austenland\\" and thought the author handled the meld of modern day and Pembroke Place well.  But within the first paragraph of meeting Mr. Nobley we knew of course she would end up with him.  Standoffish and handsome?  Then yes, we know it will be him; it's just a matter of how long.  The rest of the book was just tripe and waiting for the inevitable.  I read it in a few hours, closed the book and immediately thought \\"what a waste of time.\\"  Ironically, I wouldn't mind seeing the movie as I think some of the author's flaws could be smoothed over in a fluffy rom-com.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I liked Knocked Up but this was horrible. Can you use the F-word a few more times please?!?!?! Wow!!! It was so bad we gave up, it was a more like a dark comedy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it and want more!!!<br />Great addictive game, A bit like myst.<br />Definitely try it out<br />Excellent wonderful amazing yes yes yes
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|awesome mystery! made me jump a few times! has the right balance of difficulty. the hints are nice but I try not to use them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its fun. but not compeletly in love with it. it is a fun game it invloves focus and a lot of hand movements.
B002KS1IJC|3.0|but got charged,, I didnt even download it which is weird that I got charged, I travel alot so searching for movies on the kindle is kinda a pain.
1577314808|5.0|Echkart Tolle is an excellent writer explaining how to let go of emotional baggage from the past, and move into the future with confidence and courage, and without the emotional baggage from the past allowing a bright new future to emerge from within the individual.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|When I saw this movie in 3XD Real 3D, I thought there is no way a Blu-ray or DVD would capture the essence of what I saw on the BIG Screen. Trust me when I say it does. If you are either a &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34; or &#34;The Hobbit&#34; fan, this is a must have for your Blu-ray/DVD collection.
B0055S348W|1.0|I downloaded the free App of PrinterShare on July 14, 2013. Connected my HP printer, printed test page, all great.  Attempted to print from the menu and guess what, the app is still locked, says I must purchase the unlock keycode.  The app description clearly stated that you did not have to purchase the unlock code and this was the unlocked version.<br /><br />The following is a cut and paste from the product description:<br />Please note: This is the premium, unlocked version of PrinterShare Mobile Print. All the premium features are available, and no key is required.<br /><br />Deleted the app.  Very dissatisfied.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|I had missed this season's finale so streamed it to my TV.  The episode was terrific and kept me hanging awating next season.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Well crafted, great scenery, diabolical villian, a fast moving adventure featuring an aging Bond that still has the right stuff.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful series.  I was able to stream it for free with Amazon Prime, so I watched all three seasons during a 10 day period.  It was just fabulous.  One or two more episodes and I would have been speaking with a British accent!  lol<br /><br />Now I can't wait for season FOUR!<br /><br />Such a wonderful cast interaction and the writing makes you care about all of the characters (even the ones you first seem to dispise).  I love love love this show.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Parts were funny, but wasn't really my cup of tea. I love Tina Fey, but as she said, she is someone who has nothing to worry about, but runs around worrying about everything. We could all be so lucky.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is an amazing writer.  His characters are so well developed and the way he entertwines them captivating.  I can't wait to read A Thousand Splended Sun.
B008US4PBY|1.0|Edit: It has been 6 weeks and they still have not sent me anything. They will not respond to my e-mails. They stole my money. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING AWAY MONEY.<br />If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I ordered this device on 6/20/13. I hadn't received anything within a week, so I sent an e-mail to their customer service (on their website it states \\"if you haven't received tracking info within a reasonable time, send an e-mail!). No response. I sent another e-mail 2 days later. No response. This process goes on for 3 weeks and about 30-40 e-mails. I finally get an e-mail back simply stating, \\"your order got stuck in processing. I just checked it, it will ship soon. You will receive tracking information tomorrow via e-mail.\\" Guess what? No tracking info. It has now been another week and another 20 e-mails, no response. I'm beginning to wonder if all these other reviews are from Cronus employees and they have just stolen my money. I should have listened to all the reviews stating that they had the worst customer service on the planet
B000002TLX|5.0|This collection is wonderful.  Along with his new material Stories to Tell 3 disk CD and Emotional Remains which you can get thru Amazon. Richard Marx is a fantastic songwriter, singer, musician etc.  An all around Good Man--husband and father to three boys.  He does a lot of charity work. And has quite a sense of humor...following him at his website and twitter(dot)com account, which he tweets live (not his people) it will be quite an experience
0061990477|5.0|gathering old books for Mom - she still likes to turn the pages; me - I'm a Kindle girl; really like the number of books I can have on hand<br /><br />her all time favorite
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Great movie, some overrated parts, but that is what is all about.  I will definitely recommend this movie.  I cant wait to see the next.
B0088WLEL6|5.0|Stargate Universe presents a unique twist on the Stargate model. Unlike SG-1 and Atlantis which both follow the &#34;awake the sleeping enemy&#34; format, SGU shows us what is possible in an unrestricted universe. While it becomes apparent why the show was cancelled, this show had the potential to become another great Stargate series. Sadly, the final episode will leave you with one of the worst cliff hangers of all time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved reading about Gideon and Eva and look forward to many more stories about them and their life together.  I have read all of them so far and I can not get enough.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Kindness is power! We love Auggie and his story of bravery. Great for parents and kids.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love how optimistic I feel when I read this. The author's energy is joyous and I feel so up-lifted! She is contagious! Pam Grout has given several experiments in order to help the reader get out of his or her own preconceived ideas and allow the reader an opportunity to look at things in a while new way.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I love the style and simplicity of this watch however it gains about a minute a day. It is an inconvenience to have to re-set the time every week or so. I have forgot in the past and found my watch 30 minutes fast! C'mon Seiko! I have a Kinetic that keeps perfect time but this thing is a joke. I'd say you get what you pay for but for $50 you should be able to get a watch that at the very least keeps time.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie is hysterical and the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  I think parents should decide if children should see this though, it was adult material.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was an incredible season to watch a lot of surprises and twists to the series. I would watch again.
0439023521|5.0|I watched the movie long time ago.<br />And now I decide to read the book, although it's my teacher's requirement to read the book.<br />i think i will love it
B0072NWJRK|5.0|For me the fascination of this book was the setting. The place and the time. Poor Pamela died a gruesome death, she was in the wrong place at the wrong time mixing, it seems, with the wrong people. But these were the people of the expatriot community in Peking, a mixed bunch admittedly , but not , one might think given to murdering innocent young girls for pleasure. The turmoil of the times meant that the investigation was a sorry affair and no one was ever convicted. Her aged adoptive father, a scholar and Sinologist of many decades spent years trying to discover the murderer, maybe he did. The warlords in the north, the Japanese army advancing from the south and the air of uncertainty and waivering law enforcement unleashed in someone a sense that wickedness would go undetected and unpunished...it was all they needed, and then Pamela walked in. An excellent read and an insight into the thin veneer of civilization. Definitely read this book.
B006CHML4I|5.0|It got to me fast and easy.<br />My boyfriend loved the watch<br />He liked the straps and all the features that came with the watch
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best calculator I have ever got! Thank you! I can't not believe that I can get this at no charge. Thanks again.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan, but I absolutely loved the film. Somehow, I forgot I was watching Cruise, and I believed he was Reacher. The film stayed true to the book, and I hope they make more!!
0822208385|5.0|I purchased this for study before an audition and ended up reading it cover to cover for just the story alone. A great american classic!
B0055S348W|5.0|perhaps Making ItPrint More Than One Column ForPhone Logs Would Be Nice<br /><br />Just Used My App ToPrint Directly To My New HP
B001EJIMUG|5.0|Well done. Good acting. good story. My husband and i can curl up every year to watch this beautiful Jane Austen story.
1581804849|2.0|I think they shouldn't have paid this book publisher. On many pages, the typeface is misaligned which makes reading some pages very difficult. No, you DON'T need new glasses!
B003B02PEU|3.0|I have been a fan of John Grisham since he wrote the Firm. However I find when he goes back to Clanton for a story thrust plod along at a snail`s pace.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I've bought this bag for a trip, since I have lots of extras for my camera and the price was good, I decided to buy.<br />When the bag came, I stored all my stuff and found the protection good, good material and looks more expensive than it actually was.<br />Used for the first this past weekend, and to my dismay, had all the stuff not strapped in the little compartments spilled on the floor, because one of the 2 zippers does not close tight enough, and now I can use only one of them, leaving the defective one in one place and using just the good one.<br />Maybe I've got a defective one, but will try contacting Amazon.com and try to get a replacement, since it is perfect for what I need.
B002B292K4|5.0|The movie might have been meh, but the sound track sure isn't. Great compilation of Beatles music with a huge variety of artists. Love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read the book first, loved it!  Watched the movie, loved it!  Definitely a book you could re-read and I probably will!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a great movie! The whole family enjoyed it. THe movie arrived on time and give a five star to the vender.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I have not seen the movie but saw it gave rave reviews and won awards.  The book is a little slow to get into but it's very interesting to get into this character's mind.  I feel like there could be a sequel to this.
032147404X|5.0|Learned so much from this book. Well written especially for beginners. I recommend it to those just getting into photography.
0345536886|4.0|I liked it because it kept me guessing as to the outcome.  It also gave me an insight into how litigation really works, the lawyers, the clients, the judges, etc.  yet it was humorous. In the end it tied up all the loose ends as to what happened to the lawyers, clients, etc.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I was at first kind of leary of what they would do with this,after having seen how terrible the Nightmare of Elm St remake went a few year back.My thoughts were \\"Am I going to see yet another of my favs butchered? or will I be pleasantly suprised?\\" I ended up really enjoying it,I liked that they didnt try to totally carbon copy the original and that they took the basic bones of the storyline and made it their own movie. The gore and special effects makeup were really well done as well. Ive personally never heard of any of the cast before but they did a pretty decent job,I also liked little nods twords the original that you saw through the movie,like the rusted out car. I say to anyone who is curious about this ,to at least give it a chance.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I am a.magic nerd with several decks. Seeing this being free I went hey let's get it seems fun... 10 hours later 20%... as I'm writing this review its till downloading and only at 32%. If you want it be aware of the download time.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|This is a nice and easy story, with some great music, a great and interesting cast, and a plot line that reminds us, it's not over, until it's over.  Aging is not for sissies as they remind us in the movie, but life still holds all the possibilities for fun and laughter and love and meaning that it does at any other age.  It's all in what you make of it--each and every day. The movie doesn't provide gripping drama, or loads of tension, or gut-wrenching action scenes--so if you need that kind of stuff to enjoy a movie, this isn't for you.  But if you want an interesting story, a reminder to not judge a book by it's cover (the elderly), and relaxing entertainment, you will enjoy this movie!
B0028R3NCU|4.0|Great compact microSD reader, easy to keep on a keychain to always have handy.<br /><br />Only con: Easy to lose if not attached to something else.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|We live around Jackson MS, so we had an additional reason to see this film.<br /><br />Setting was different from your typical major release. Very good acting, funny at times. Definitely a chick flick--only one significant male role, and that character was poorly developed.<br /><br />But even as a male viewer, I would call it well above average.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app its kind of like temple run but instead of a mutant chasing you a subway gaurd chases you I can't believe its free!
B008GJV2OA|5.0|I won't spoil it. Any movie with a whacko general named Jack D. Ripper and Peter Sellers playing more than one role has got to be worth it's weight in laughter!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|It was a very interesting movie, very suspenseful. The outcome was not predictable. Tommy Lee did a great job as usual.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I feel this is a book that is definitely a book worth reading, and I highly recommend it. Very well written too.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|What a delight! One some times assumes one has more or less at least known about the major influences of the western canon. The book is an adventure, a poem, an intrigue, gossipy, scholarly and great fun. Cant say how much I enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|1.0|Awful, awful movie.<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality is that it stars Jennifer Lawrence. It isn't even worth a 20 word review, but since that is the bare minimum for reviews on Amazon...this now completes my 20 required words.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is the most awesomest (i know its not a word but it describes the app so well) app ever i get most if not all my music from this app and it download to the phone so i can save it and play it anywhere.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|When watching this movie you have to keep in mind that you should enjoy it for what it is. This isn't a masterpiece among animated film, it's no Toy Story 3. There's no escaping the fact that it's a marketing ploy to sell dolls. That being said, this is a really entertaining movie. Even though there's a drastic change in the design of the ponies now that they're human, the personalities and quirks of the characters still remain in tact ( Twilight Sparkle as a human is adorable) and they're is a abundance of little nods to My little Pony's older fans so it is very true to it's source material. I think the humor and animation(while stiff at times) is a lot fun and very expressive. However, I do have problems with this movie. One problem being the music. Now, I'm a huge fan of Daniel Ingram, a lot of the songs he composes for television match the quality to that of a motion picture. In this movie is filled with very generic sounding pop music and only one of the tracks really stand out(those of you who watch the movie probably know which one I'm talking about) All in all this is really just a longer episode of My little pony. There's no real offensive material or over the top girlyness. It's just a fun time for all ages!
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|This movie was the exact opposite of funny. It was full of constant nagging and anger. Leslie Mann's character was so selfish that she should've been going to counseling 1:1 not dragging poor Paul Rudd's character to couples therapy. The one truly laughable moment of this movie was at the end when Melissa McCarthy is going off on the school principal with some occasional digs at Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's character.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|RATE HIGH, GOOD QUALITY!!!! SHOWS CLEAR AND SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMED TO ANYONE TO BUY, A MUST HAVE IN ANY COLLECTION!
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|Can watch this movie over and over....Dory cracks me up every time. Great for all ages and it always makes you feel good.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|RATE HIGH, GOOD QUALITY!!!! SHOWS CLEAR AND SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMED TO ANYONE TO BUY, A MUST HAVE IN ANY COLLECTION!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Wanted a game to be able to play while on the road and this is it! My kids love it too.
B003NRWW58|2.0|Love Dr Who, This one never hit with me. Maybe something about the main guy. Didn't like when he switched over to Dr Who either.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's nice to have a calculator when I need it where I need it as well.  If you're always needing a calculator for your Fire, this is the one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is hard to believe this is just off of someone`s imagination! I loved it! But I am sad to say that the Hunger Games series is over! :(
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Always entertaining, however hard to loose main characters. You become attached to story line and characters and then have to start over.
0385343248|4.0|I read this book because my wife borrowed it from someone and it was just laying around the house.  I don't usually read historical romances such as this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My usual fare is scifi and horror.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting element of this book is its glimpse into Japanese culture.  When one reads the book it is obvious that you are reading a western caricature of historical Japanese culture.  But it is a GOOD caricature.<br /><br />The book is a little long winded in parts.  Especially the bits on political intrigue.  However this may be due to my own personal tastes rather than any failing of the author.  Also the main plot points are highly predictable.  That being said it is a very enjoyable read and I would recommend the book to just about anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Clear graphics.  Good challenges.  Love the features like &quot;undo&quot;.  Provides many different versions of the game so you don't get bored.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Had to see this because planning to see 2nd one..turned out to be Action packed.  Will definitely recommend to others.
B001NHNG64|4.0|not great, but good.  I bought the next in the series if that is any indication.  easy read, that stays interesting
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Tons of fun. Young or old, beginner or expert, there is something here for everyone. Great graphics lots of goals and achievements, unlock different chimps to maneuver your way through the different levels. Collect gems to unlock new levels and gobble up bananas to keep your chimp strong and happy. Works great on my android. Quickly downloads and your ready to go. Would have gladly.paid the $.99 for this much fun, was lucky enough to get it as the free app of the day and spent the rest of the day playing and well into the night. 5 stars all the way. Get to the app store and start playing in minutes. You will be glad you did.<br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the subway surfers because it gives the kids something to do when they are bored... also Canberra a challenge for them to beat their friends. Always cool!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's a very good book. I enjoyed it very much, I couldn't put my kindle down. I wish it was longer though
B009CCBCU4|3.0|Fun historical fiction.  Good for a high school Spanish class?  There are a couple of scenes that a teacher should check first.  Would get a discussion going as to what life might have been like for the pre-Mexican tribes of long ago.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very good game  the last upgrade was the trick .I would definitely recommend this game..good graphics..needs more info on what items can do
030746363X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books! Ferris cover's so much ground in here I can always just open it up to a random page and be engrossed. Definitely for anyone interested in improving their health.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's like a game and the movie named into a amazing bunch of calcimun.I hope you download this the bomb of bananas.
B002BWP49C|5.0|My daughter, being one of the millions of Twilight fans loves this movie and I loved the price as always!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Waiting anxiously for season 3! Caught up on season 1 & 2 in only 2 weeks couldn't put it down.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is as close as you can get to the controllers built 12 years ago for the original system.  They are high quality and have an even longer cord than the originals.  Beats buying knock offs and used controllers.  Too bad they are not making these here but for the price, having it shipped in from Japan isn't that bad.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I love this period in history and Thomas Hardy's novels.  This was very well done and true to the book. Though I knew how it ended from having read it in years gone by, I still enjoyed seeing it on screen.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was a very thought provoking read and one to get very involved in.<br />However rather a heart wrenching story
B0027Z5DM6|5.0|Movie portrays the value of family time and not rushing through life trying to get to the top of your job. Great family movie and life lesson.
B00899F0G8|5.0|love it and will def buy more episodes. this is by far my favorite show and i recommend it to anyone that loves a good mystery.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|This product may be good for others, but I actually made a mistake and misunderstood what this product actually was about.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I can play this game all day long at my house
0679731369|5.0|This book is anything but straightforward. It tells the story (or rather many stories) of Flaubert, father of the modern novel, but also of its obsessive-compulsive narrator whose obsession with Flaubert stands for his hidden inquiry into his own life. Barnes juggles the elements of his 'story', messing up chronology, genre, and voice in intriguing and engaging ways.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|My Son told me about the series and said it was well worth a look. I have to admit I really liked it, after all where can you find a science fiction/ western in one show. The plots are a little convoluted but I like that. The final straw in the pile was it has been mentioned several times on The Big Gang Theory--what more could you want. Now the shocker I'm a 65 year old History and English Major.

B00AXVH8KQ|4.0|My favorite tune is No Destruction.  Love the lyrics and love love love the dylan-esque sound.  I first heard it on KCRW and immediately struck by it and went in search for Foxygen on Amazon.  Their music is great fun!
B00C6B8TB8|5.0|The Incredible Hulk (2008). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One Hour, 52 min. Director's Cut: Two Hours, 15 mins.<br />Director Louis Leterrier. Written by Zak Penn.<br /><br />This is a re-written review from June 20, 2008<br />The Incredible Hulk returns with a different lead actor and the HULK has a new face and body. A new backstory is established in this re-boot.<br />Universal Pictures failed to make a sequel from Ang Lee's version, The Hulk (2003), so Marvel Studios acquired the rights.<br /> Those that were disappointed in the first [[ASIN:B001DRF84W Hulk [Blu-ray]]] (2003) motion picture will find this second film much better and satisfying.<br />  Bruce Banner (now played by Edward Norton) is hiding in Brazil. Still suffering from the effects of the gamma rays that metabolized him into the Hulk every time his heart rate and blood pressure increases above the level. He tries to control it the best he can and is still looking for a botanical cure...any cure.<br />At his work at the bottling company, he cuts himself on the electrical box switch and his infected blood drips and falls below. Knowing the health and safety laws, Bruce races down the conveyor belt and finds the blood spill. He cleans it up. Unbeknownst to him, part of his blood has already passed through onto an open bottle being processed. The bottle ends up in the United States in the refrigerator of a man (Stan Lee in a cameo appearance). He drinks of it and suddenly the bottle falls to the floor. We don't see what happened to him, but we are told he got quite a kick.<br />  General Ross (now played by William Hurt) is told of this incident and it puts him on the right track to Bruce. He knows for sure that Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, but he is also after Bruce for the military secrets he knows.<br />General Ross has a secret weapon of his own to conquer the Hulk in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who has been injected to morph as the Abomination beast.<br />  With the help of his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (now played by Liv Tyler), he will try to control his rampage.<br />All this leads to a showdown between the Hulk and the Abomination beast in downtown Harlem.<br />  The very last minute of this film (before the end credits) contains a nice surprise cameo appearance ensuring the Hulk will return in another movie in the near future.<br />  Thanks to some lighting effects in the film, we also get to see the Hulk in his original comic book grey color.<br />  Bill Bixby, who played &#34;Dr. David Bruce Banner&#34; in the original live action tv series, &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; (1972-82,88,89,90) is seen in archive footage from the tv series, [[ASIN:B005R2SHX8 The Courtship of Eddie's Father: The Complete First Season (4 Discs)]] (1969-72).<br />  Lou Ferrigno, who played &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; in the CBS live-action tv series (1978-82,88,89,90) returns in a cameo appearance as the University Security Guard accepting the pizza.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Tony Nappo, Joris Jarsky, Greg Bryk, Billy Parrott.

B003HARV3Y|4.0|I enjoyed the movie enough that I've watched a few times. I never read the book to compare it to, so I can't complain about the accuracy.
1475143389|5.0|When you have the motivation to go work out, it is the most frustrating thing not getting the results you crave. I spent years in the gym, where I would plateau hardcore on some exercises.<br /><br /> After 6 weeks, I am very happy with my progress. On every exercise I am considerably stronger than I was 6 weeks ago. I am eating right and I am making sure my form is perfect. You just need to read the book and take it seriously, no shortcuts and you will get the results you want.<br /><br />The best part is his feedback. If you are stuck on the same weight for a few weeks and you are sure your form, reps and diet is right , then reach out to him and he will help you.<br /><br />I hate spending money and I must have read a hundred reviews of this book. I am extremely glad I bought it,  because results are the only thing that matter and after 6 weeks I am convinced that I am going to get the exact results i want.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Prior to July 2013, this was a great app. Now it locks up my kindle and refuses to close or work properly. Don't bother.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best app ever it is a Combo of minions and running the only app better is real racing 3 so funny this app is<br /><br />#playliketheminions
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Definitely started out a page turner and kept me guessing, but I thought it had a weak finish.  Also too many unexplained plot turns or disconnects.  Got a little confusing at times.  Good not great, but worth reading.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I didn't think it was as good as the previous Hobbit movies, although I can't quite say why.  Just me, I suppose.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie is better than the 2nd. This is true for most sequels though! Crazy ride and funny! Good Watch!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is one awesomely done show. Stays true to the books for the most part. All the characters are engaging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome it is challenging but also fun and suitable for all ages. I enjoy playing this with my 5 year old
B009WUBERW|5.0|I love the jokes. It's great to see these guys doing what they have always done and still looking buff while doing it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle and look forward to reading tons of books, magazines, newpapers & more!! Thanks for making it easy to use on my cell.phone!
B0058EA3MS|4.0|This film would be an interesting introduction to human beings if we were to meet up with extraterrestrials. As a film, it has brilliant parts and dodgy parts, but overall is excellent. As a study of average English people in a certain place and time, it is uncanny. The trip Up North is particularly powerful. And the sense that this is what life is hits home with dark resonance. If you are looking for a good time, better look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a deep slice of life, and a few good ideas about how to better live it in the unspectacular, pedestrian way most of us have to, this is a film not to miss.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got app becuz its the best all of my friends got this app and this is the absolute best but i don't care I love it i got this feeling on the several day when u were tone I threw ur stuff into a bag
B000UR9T82|4.0|Looks good on Blu-Ray.  Just needs to include ALL the bonus material from each movie.  Still a good buy at the price.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|The unedited version that comes with this Blu ray is awesome<br />There is much more details to the story that make the film even better.<br />All the extras that are included are great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was better than I thought it would be. Seems easy at first, but definitely becomes a challenge. I kept thinking I would look up some hints, but I stuck with it. Finally finished it with no hints but my index finger is sore from tapping harder & harder, trying to make things work that weren't supposed to. Looking forward to more levels.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Fantastic!!!<br />Every one should have THE RAMONES first album<br />I like the remastered mixes and the extras that are on it.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|As Sony comes out with bigger & bigger headphones, Fiio as well comes out with bigger & bigger amps. First I ordered the MDR XB700's with the Fiio e7, then went on with a XB900/e11 combo, and lastly the XB1000's with the e17. Remarkable. Huge difference in bass and sound quality. I even use the e17 on complete sound systems once in a while. Boosts bass and volume with no distortion and is near perfect in my opinion.
B00B125QRS|5.0|One of the best box sets out there.<br />Remastered and mixed great.<br />Eddie Van Halen is a master guitar player.<br />If you are a Van Halen fan you have to have this.
B007REV4YI|5.0|To me Daniel Craig is the Bond Ian Fleming told you about. And this is the best in the Craig series so far!
