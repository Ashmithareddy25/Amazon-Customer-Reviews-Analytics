B002TYZKIM|5.0|The movie captures the magic that Michael brought to his work from the very beginning.  I remember being mesmerized the firt time he and his brothers were on the Ed Sullivan Show way back when, and then in the 80's when I got to see him live I was impressed with the way he brought a huge stadium audience to its feet.  And so one of the great joys of this movie was seeing that for all that has happened to him in the intervening years, he had not lost his magic nor his desire to share his gifts and love with the world through music, dance, and pure spectacle.  As other reviewers have said, he was still clearly the star and a consummate professional in these rehearsals even when holding back (I was struck by how when he missed a line in the medley of early hits he could pick up right on cue).  The movie features some incredible performances, and I think it is so fitting that all of his fans get to see what he was planning--not just those who had tickets to the concerts in London.  And I would totally agree that the movie should be seen on the big screen first, if possible; Michael meant the show to be larger than life and it's the best way to see his last gift to his fans.  I'll defintiely see it again, though I am pre-ordering the DVD so I get it as soon as it comes out!
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Excellent new music from a 90's favorite. Tracks 3, 5, and 6 are the best. Still wish they would crank up the intensity like they did on TEN, but I guess those days are long gone.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This film is the next best thing to actually going to the concert.  It depicts Michael as a kind, caring, hard working performer. One comes away with a new sense of who he was and what life should be about i.e. respecting and treating others kindly.  The music was great and the videos were stunning.  The old and new material was perfectly blended.  R.I.P Michael.  We love you

1891252089|5.0|I have been practicing \\"Power Yoga\\" for some time, but I found that I really wasn't a big fan of that book.  I wanted a different take on Ashtanga Yoga so I bought this.  It is exactly what I've been looking for.  From time to time I might want to review the specifics of a posture and this book has a full page description and pictures of every asana in proper sequence.  It also has pages that show the different sequences of postures, and includes options for shortened sessions.  These pages are excellent as a quick reference.  This book is so much more straight forward than what I'd been using before.    One problem I can forsee with this book is the sprial binding.  It looks like it will be difficult to keep the pages from eventually tearing loose, especially considereng that it will be a much used reference.

As soon as I finished watching season 2 of Dexter, I bought the DVD for season 3. I strongly recommend owning this series for years of pleasure.

0312427999|4.0|Although Ms. Klein's book is very thorough and very good as far as it goes, it's theoretical background seems to be limited to economics and thus fails to put the policies from the 1970's to the present in the context of long term imperialism and militarism.  The invasions of Mexico, Phillipines, and various countries in Latin America all happened before the Chicago School existed.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Buy this if you want a terrific metal album. Period.    If you're skeptical about Megadeth after the last few albums, don't hesitate.  I've been a fan since the Peace Sells tour, and this album is right up there with Peace Sells and So Far, and frankly it's more consistently good than Rust.       I waited a few weeks to buy the album out of fear of disappointment, but have listened to it just about every day since. I'm back to eagerly waiting for Dave's next release.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|First, a response to faulty information in other reviews:  1) This is not supposed to be a Christmas album - it is a Winter album, meaning the style and lyrical content pertain to the things of Winter, including Christmas but not dwelling on it.  Another great recording of this kind, for example, is \\"Voices of Winter\\" by Herdman, Hills and Mangsen.  2) Some reviewers whine about Gordon Sumner's (Sting's) vocal performance here.  The tone and vocal style of this album are clearly connected to Sting's \\"Songs from the Labyrinth,\\" for which he did lots of historical research to achieve the style of vocal performances originally used in 17th century British song.  If you can't handle being transported through music to this time and place, this album isn't for you.  And try to listen to it on a good stereo system, not ear-buds or cheap car speakers.    3) It is posited that only hardcore Sting fans could like this recording.  I am not a hardcore Sting fan and I think it is the best work he's ever done.  I also enjoy his work with the Police and certain selections from his solo catalog, but they each have their own appeal and should be evaluated on their own merits.  I like this recording because the quality musicianship and \\"live\\" feel transcend contemporary holiday music muck (such as Robert Zimmerman's (Bob Dylan's) recent mistake of an album).  It has a rustic vibrancy enveloped in a haunting winter fog, vividly suggesting the British Isles or Scandinavian mountains in midwinter.         In summation, if you thing think Sting has been \\"washed up\\" since the Police broke up who knows why you are looking here in the first place, but it might be worth your while to return to Sting's solo catalog and rework your way through up to this point - it might bring an understanding of what being an artist is about, and open new horizons for enjoyment of music in general.  On the other hand, if you appreciate traditional music of Great Britain and Scandinavia (Karan Casey, Battlefield Band, Steeleye Span, Vasen, Savina Yannatou, etc. etc.) I can highly recommend \\"If on a Winter's Night\\".
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|John Carpenter's The Fog (1979) is a typical John Carpenter movie.  Carpenter's horror movies are very simple.  Nothing complex.  This simple approach to horror really works well.  His three Halloween movies fall into this category as well (Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III).  The Fog, however, is pretty unique.  I think the setting of the movie is its greatest asset.  This movie takes place in the seaside village of Antonio Bay, California.  The basic story is that on the night of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town, a thick fog emerges from the bay area and comes ashore.  But what also comes ashore in the fog are the ghosts of murdered sailors who want to get revenge for the sins of the town's founding fathers a century earlier.  Time is of the essence, for the town's people must solve a crime that's a century old, or die.  As the fog rolls in, the ghosts do too, and the eerieness level increases.<br /><br />This movie stars Adrienne Barbeau (John Carpenter's wife at the time) as the lighthouse disc jockey, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H2O, etc.), Janet Leigh (Curtis's real life mother, and the star of Psycho), John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Charles Cyphers (Halloween, Halloween II), and Tom Atkins (Halloween III).  The acting is good throughout.  John Carpenter himself even appears in the movie very briefly near the beginning.  In my opinion the strongest acting performance was by Adrienne Barbeau.  She has a good disc jockey voice and her on-air demeanor during the fog crisis is a strong point of the movie.<br /><br />This DVD comes with special features, two of which are called \\"Tales From The Mist - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary\\" and \\"Fear On Film - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary\\".  There are also outtakes, an advertising gallery, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and interesting audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.<br /><br />If you want to watch a very good horror movie that is vintage John Carpenter, then The Fog is your movie.  I highly recommend it.  It's a good movie to watch late on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished.e.  I highly recommend it.  It's a good movie to watch late on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished.
0307269981|1.0|It is hard to believe that Stieg Larsson wrote both \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  I enjoyed \\"Tattoo\\" because Lisbeth Salander was a new, unusual but plausible protagonist and the plot (although it rambled at times) was fairly tight.  With \\"Fire,\\" Larsson threw any pretense of reality or a cohesive plot out the window.<br /><br />The book is populated with endless people whose names begin with a \\"B\\" or an \\"S\\" making it difficult to remember who they are.  After a while it didn't matter because I didn't care. There is a misogynist, bumbling police force; a sensationalist media on steroids; a group of BAAAD gangstas and a couple of de rigeur good guys who still believe in Lisbeth when the rest of Sweden is after her blood.  Not that this 4'11\\" 90 lb superwoman needs their help, she can do BAAAD all by herself.<br /><br />At times, the book reads like an A-Z Street Guide to Sweden, giving endless, pointless directions.  At other times we are given excruciating details of Lisbeth's shopping spree at Ikea as she furnishes her new condo in one of the most exclusive buildings in Stockholm.  The condo made me wonder how much research Larsson had actually done.  Later in the book we find out that Lisbeth's condo is 3800 sq. ft. and has 21 rooms of which she only uses 3.  I have yet to find a condo in an exclusive building (think New York) that has 21 rooms in 3800 sq. ft.  I did the math and the rooms come out to roughly 14'x13' - tiny.  The place would look like a rabbit warren.  But then, why should the condo make any more sense than the rest of the book.
B0000DYJM6|3.0|This is quite a confusing album.  Most of the songs on cd 2 are excellent as are a couple on cd 1.  With that being said, albums like Binaural would have been much better if some of the songs on Lost Dogs would have been used there.  Furthermore many of the songs on Cd 1 and a couple on Cd2 should never have seen the light of day.  This should have been a one disc collection but it seems someone wanted to extract some extra cash out of the fans--something which seems out of keeping with Pearl Jam.  The album is worth a buy but do yourself a favor and pick up a used copy.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|I love Sandra Bullock.  My friends all think I'm crazy, but come on; she's adorable, funny and extremely charming.  How can you not love her?  Sure, she may not always have the best taste in film projects, but to tell you the truth, Bullock is one of those rare actresses who can make a horrible film worth my time.  I'd watch her in anything.  Thankfully she didn't have to do much to make `The Proposal' worth my time.  Sure, the film is clich&eacute; ridden (and practically a slapstick version of her superior 95 offering `While You Were Sleeping') but it is breezy, funny and engaging.<br /><br />Andrew Paxton is dying to make editor at his Publishing Firm but he's stuck playing second fiddle to Margaret Tate (Bullock in full on Miranda Priestly mode).  When it becomes known that the Canadian Tate is about to be deported she makes a proposal; Paxton agree to marry her so she can stay in the states or she will destroy his career.  Despite the harsh penalties that will come if it is uncovered that this is a hoax, Paxton feels as though he has no choice but to take up her offer.  Paxton and Tate then travel to Alaska for Andrew's grandmother's birthday, and it is there, in the most beautiful place in the world (yes, seriously, I've been there...it is beyond gorgeous) they fall in love.<br /><br />Yeah, you knew it was going to happen.<br /><br />Sandra is spot on perfection here, using her infectious charm to liven up her comedic timing.  She has been better before, but she has this down to a science and has no problems getting the audience to connect.  Her chanting in the woods scene alone is worth the price of admission.  I have been hard on Ryan Renyolds before (he is often stiff, one note and ridiculously good looking, which is enough reason to hate him, let alone the fact the he is married to my dream girl) but he steps up his game here and holds his own against Bullock.  Sure, she is better than him, but is sarcastic shtick works very well with his character.<br /><br />The supporting cast is hit or miss, with Betty White raising the bar and becoming the most memorable part of this film (the Oscar talk his preposterous, but if it happens I'll die in supportive laughter).  Craig T. Nelson is a stereotype, but he's decent.  Oscar Nunez is effectively uncomfortable (that dance scene is just...um...nevermind) and Malin Akerman is utterly ravishing.  I really like Mary Steenburgen from time to time, but this is not one of those times.  She's just kind of meh for me.<br /><br />In the end I totally propose that you give `The Proposal' a try (I'm not one for puns but I couldn't resist).  It's a really funny and likable film that makes up for a total lack of originality with chemistry and charm.ss, with Betty White raising the bar and becoming the most memorable part of this film (the Oscar talk his preposterous, but if it happens I'll die in supportive laughter).

1434102815|2.0|This edition of the Elements of Style does NOT include the material by E.B. White!  For some incomprehensible reason, the publishers have stripped all of White's excellent observations, tips, and essay material out of the book.<br /><br />I grew up with Strunk & White.  I used it as a college teacher and tutor.  I used it for decades as a professional writer.  When my copy was destroyed in a fire, I sought to replace it and was entirely too careless:  I simply looked for the same title (\\"The Elements of Style\\") and clicked to order it.<br /><br />I would award Strunk & White five stars.  Without White's material, The Elements of Style is a two-star book.  This weak-tea version of \\"Elements\\" is merely adequate.  If you really want insight into style, purchase Stunk & WHITE.  I was careless; I want to alert other purchasers before they make the same error.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Who can compete with Madonna in the field of pop music, especially dance music?  It would be pointless to give an opinion about these songs, since we already know they are fabulous!  Some of these tracks are works of High Pop Art.  So, as far as I am concerned, there are 4 pertinent questions:<br /><br />1.) Is there anything special about the songs chosen for the collection?  The advantage for me is that in Madonna's early days I bought cassette tapes instead of CD's, and so anything that I don't already have on CD is a blessing.  \\"Everybody\\", \\"Dress You Up\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" fulfill that requirement, so right there I have an excuse to purchase this set.  Also, this version of \\"Express Yourself\\" is the more hip, less busy version, which I like.  And of course, there are the 2 new tracks.  On \\"Revolver\\", Madonna does Britney better than Britney, with the theme of the song being \\"killer\\" sex.  \\"Celebration\\" is an archetype of Madonna's work:  seductive, direct, happy and supremely danceable.  (By the way, since \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\", \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\", \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Oh Father\\" were omitted, it seems that this \\"celebration\\" was intended to be mostly up-tempo.)<br /><br />2.) How is the remastered sound?  At first I thought, this is going to be a delicate call.  Most of Madonna's music is not old enough to really need remastering; it already sounds flawless.  But when I reached \\"Holiday\\", I heard a clarity and fullness that I believe I had not heard before.  The same applies to \\"Everybody\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Lucky Star\\" - I could go on, but the point seems to be that most of the 80's tracks were improved by the remastering.  BUT - I also feel that \\"Frozen\\", \\"Miles Away\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and \\"Hollywood\\" sound even better too, so...<br /><br />3.) You might ask, what is so great about hearing songs you've already heard over and over again?  Just put the discs in, lie back, and let the avalanche of hits fall upon you.  IT IS A THRILL.  They are in random order, not chronological, so unless you memorize the track listing, you don't know what's coming next.<br /><br />4.) Does the package include anything other than the music? Yes.  There is a booklet with many great photos and representations, and a separate poster of Madonna, which is the album cover enlarged to about 14 X 14 inches.  Mine is now on the wall of my office at work.<br /><br />So go buy it already!, and let the avalanche of hits fall upon you.  IT IS A THRILL.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Though I see this long awaited CD has already been reviewed umpteen times, I'll weigh in on it anyhow. Though I kind of liked it on first listen, it took me many more listens to really get into it. And though I don't think that The Incident is Porcupine Tree's finest effort, it certainly is one of the band's more ambitious outings.  Here's what I like best:  Disc 1)The hard edges of The Blind House which alternate with light vocals; Drawing the Line which features some great percussion; the evocative Time Flies; the hard-driving and very satisfying Octane Twisted; and the pounding Circle of Manias.  Disc 2)The spacey, percussive Bonnie the Cat; and Remember Me Lover, the harmonies of which exude an inescapable Floydian influence.  Though it may take many progressive rock fans repeated listens to digest all that Steven Wilson and band have wrought with this multi-textured opus, the time spent is well rewarded in the end. The Incident is yet one more Porcupine Tree album that should be in every collection. The CD is accompanied by an attractive booklet containing lyrics, pictures and pertinent album information. Enjoy!
B001TODCII|1.0|Sorry -- Bought this on the recommendation of Liam Neeson's acting and shots of Paris.  Well, there are only a couple of shots of Paris, and none worth a second glance -- that's all you get is a glance at anything, as the movie never stops rushing from one place to antoher, pausing only long enough for Neeson to dispose of an enemy in a few quick cuts.  There's no dialog worth mentioning in the entire movie, and the only subplot (with his French friend as part of the crime ring) so overused in detective/action movies it's blase now.  Liam Neeson's acting cannot overcome poor plot, poor dialog, poor filming, poor costuming, poor editing, and poor acting on every one else's part (his 17 year old daughter acts like she's six years old, even Famke Janssen is flat as his ex-wife).  The reason this is only an hour and a half is because of the total lack of content.  Pierre Morel (director)and Luc Besson (writer) clearly demonstrate why Hollywood, as lame and unoriginal as it is, continues to reign over the movie world -- because these people are more lame and unoriginal.

B001FB55HQ|4.0|Yet again we see one more movie from the Terminator Franchise. Ever since the first Teaser Trailer for Salvation was launched, I had been excited for this movie. Recently there had been very big speculation with this particular Movie, especially by the Critics World. I was surprised to see this movie getting whacked so much by the critics at [...] I have seen this movie at last and I can say this Movie deserved much more than what it received at Rotten Tomatoes. There is no doubt Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the best among the series. But this movie was better than T3: Rise of Machines.<br /><br />When McG signed up for this movie I had been apprehensive because honestly, I hated Charlie's Angels. Terminator Salvation is a new beginning, so we should not compare with its predecessor. There is no time travel and of course no mission for hunting down the members of the Connors. High point of this movie is its action; it has been a long time since I had seen action like this. Special Effects incorporated are top notch. As far as character development is concerned... there are some places where certain elements are missing. Considering this as the start of the trilogy this can be forgiven. I hope this will be dealt with other upcoming series. Columnists have complained that Christian Bale was cold as John Connor. I can say that when the central character has been subjected to so many years of war, we can always expect to hope for less sentiment as that happens in today's reality. Terminator Salvation gyrates round the Character of Marcus Wright (Very well portrayed by Sam Worthington) & Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). This movie was meant to be action oriented so as to show us the apocalyptic world post judgment day. Apart from the stunning cinematography Danny Elfman's music gives us an edgy metallic score.<br /><br />Since so many reviews have already given out the plot details of 'Salvation' I will not be writing it as it ruins the anticipation. Finished with that, closing notes will be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby'<br /><br />Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD. Expectantly it might give us some more details.be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby'    Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD.

0312570740|5.0|I read \\"Metal Men\\" by Copetas when it was published in the 1980's.  At the time it was a supposed expose about Marc Rich and his expoitative behavior and treachery, and was the only book written about him.  There was never an interview with Rich in the book, and when I re-read it after the Clinton pardon in 2001 it still left me with a feeling that alot was missing.  This new book by Ammann is a satisfying, eye-opening piece of balanced journalism that sheds enough light on Rich's life and works to allow the reader to make his own judgment on the man and the circumstances.  A well-written read for anyone interested in the life and motivations of an international businessman and, by default, political figure.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City is an inimitable movie; some group will like it while some will simply hate it.This movie is based on Frank Miller's Graphical Novel of the similar name.The movie covers three stories knotted together to give the feeling of completeness. There are three major stories 'The Hard Goodbye','The Big Fat Kill' & [...]<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye : This part focuses on the retribution of man for the untimely murder of his one night lover.<br /><br />The Big Fat Kill : Portrays the war between a group of Prostitutes trying to hold their city from Corrupt Police, Mercenaries and the Mob.<br /><br />The Yellow : Focuses on the old Police Officer who tries to protect a young woman from being raped and murdered by a psychopathic sadistic killer from an influential political family.<br /><br />Sin City provides a huge cast starring Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood and many more. What makes this movie so unique is that it is made in High quality Black and White with some colorization on certain portion of the scene giving it a polished look. This new approach has really made this movie very special; though the movie consists of enough blood and gore, the presentation has made it some what lighter.<br /><br />This movie carries with itself a likable story, if you like movies based on graphical novel, then you can give it a shot.
B002OB9KPE|3.0|Transatlantic has found a happy marriage between accessible rock and pop sensibilities and long proggish instrumental sections, but they seem unwilling to push the envelope.  Don't look for them to create and explore new musical landscapes.  The playing and singing are excellent and at times brilliant, but too often it sounds cliched and it's always within their comfort zone.  I guess I expect more from progressive rock, particularly a group with so much talent.  In this sense, Transatlantic seems like a Ferrari that only goes into second gear: All that peformance is sadly unacessible.    My other issue is that, as others have stated, this album seems to have become a vehicle for Morse's overt (and Stolt's covert) proselytizing.  The religious message is in your face and over the top, and it detracts greatly from the music.  Thank you for wanting to save my soul and all guys, but from where I sit the message comes through as preachy and arrogant.  Can't you accept that if others feel the need for spiritual guidance that they will be able to find it themselves?    Lastly, the second disc is hit-or-miss.  Of the covers, Hogweed hits the mark, but I Need You is still I Need You.  I've tried, but I can't yet stomach the whole thing.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight will be one of the first Super Hero Movie which has broke all the records held by its peers like Spider Man, Iron Man & Superman Returns.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's performance as 'Joker' has immortalized one of the best screen play Villain in modern times. Unlike 1989's Batman, this will be the best comic book adaptation successfully put to screen and I doubt whether there will be any movie like this unless Christopher breaks his own record with an even more successful sequel.<br /><br />I have always preferred Christian Bale as Batman rather than Val Kilmer, George Clooney. This time he displayed a much more mature role. If 'Batman Begins' had created the groundwork for the upcoming sequel, then Dark Knight proved to be a superior and more thriving motion picture. It is a real tragedy to miss a prodigy like Heath.<br /><br />Unlike Jack Nicolson 'Joker'which proved to be a funnier adversary of the Batman, Heath as 'Joker' was Devil's Incarnate, one who would kill with a smile on face and the most challenging nemesis ever to be put up in a Super Hero based Movies. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face was an excellent pick and he balanced his role delightfully.<br /><br />Apart from the brilliant performance by supporting actors like Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordan, the movie provided us with some of the unforgettable musical score by typical talents James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />Closing Note: Worth watching multiple times, and if you are an avid Movie Collector then you can add this to your collection. It wouldn't be a disappointment.
0316069906|4.0|Foer does a wonderful job of endearing himself to the reader in this journey into the question of what food he should feed his son and himself.  He does this with interesting stories of his family and then prints letters from people more close to the ins and outs of the meat industry in order tell their sides of the story.  Some of my favorite passages are from the other people's vantage points.  In doing this he offers the reader the chance to come to his or her own conclusion.    Overall, I am very encouraged to see a book like this on the market.  It seems that though this information is and has been readily available right here on Amazon that Foer might actually somehow bring this information to a wider audience.  I hope that is the case, though I have my doubts.  In nearly 20 years of being a vegetarian and for most of that nearly vegan I have always wondered how people can ignore the truth about what they eat, especially in this age of instant information.  Will this book or the movie Food, Inc actually change anything?  I hope so.    I am disappointed however that Foer, unlike several other books I've read, neglects diving deeper into the milk industry.  I don't know if Foer ever made the difficult decision to give up cheese, milk, and eggs for himself and his son, but I hope he did.  The fact that he nearly ignores dairy bothered me throughout the book.  I kept hoping to get to the chapter where he would tell the reader that he had in fact given up  milk as well, but this bombshell never came.  To that end, I hope that readers of this book will find themselves thirsty for even more truth and read books like the ones by John Robbins, Erik Marcus, Howard Lyman, and Dr. John McDougall.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Because of the publicity put up by the aggressive marketing by its distributors, I had decided to read Alan Moore's Graphic Novel first before watching the movie.<br /><br />Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' had been one of the unsurpassed graphic novels I have ever read in a long time. Those who have not read the novel, the story of 'Watchmen' exist in an alternate reality where Americans have won the Vietnam War, Nixon had been elected three consecutive times for the successful drive in Vietnam and the Superheroes/Vigilantes are the part of the Society. This story originated at the peak of the Cold War, and what kept the Russians form launching an aggressive campaign against U.S. was due to the presence of Dr. Manhattan (enacted by Billy Crudup). Due to the violent methods of providing justice, the superheroes had become detested among the public, thus leading to pass of Legislation Act which outlawed them. Though most of the heroes accepted forced retirement, two of them had been kept of the book 'Dr. Manhattan' & 'The Comedian' as they were working on Government's surveillance. Only 'Rorschach' was one of the vigilantes who had not accepted the act and continued his work undercover.<br /><br />The story starts with the murder of one of the vigilante 'The Comedian' followed by an independent investigation taken up by Rorschach; likewise we get introduced to all the other Superheroes who were given the name 'Watchmen'. First half is mostly flashback which introduces us to the characters at the same time it slowly carries the story to the core Novel's Climax.<br /><br />This movie could have been way much better. The entire novel was full of intensity. Some of the characters seemed to be less developed in this adaptation other than Rorschach, which was done marvelously by Jackie Earle Haley. Even Dr. Manhattan's tone didn't seem true. Though most of the content had been taken directly from the novel still some segment looked consciously altered to mesh with the alternate ending. Even 'Tales Of The Black Freighter' was not included within the movie which I think can be justified with the limitation of the time constraint.<br /><br />Visually this movie is stunning packed with slow paced action which we have already seen in Zack Snyder's 300, with some of the musical tracks of the late 80's. Unlike other Comic based movies, this movie had been too brutal for which it got easily 'R' Rating.<br /><br />There could have been lot of potential to make this story a magnum opus keeping true to the content of Alan Moore. Anyone who has not read the novel will not be able to realize what have failed actually while recreating this into a big motion picture.<br /><br />Looking at the efforts undertaken I would prefer to give it a solid 6/10.<br /><br />New Update: Director's Cut<br /><br />Well on seeing the Director's Cut I felt good, may be this was the better adaptation compared to the Theatrical Release.<br /><br />It seems that after each viewing this Movie is really turning out to be good. Its strange that on the first screening I had been very skeptical but later on it did click for me. May be I should have given it more chance.<br /><br />New Rating: 8/10he Black Freighter' was not included within the movie which I think can be justified with the limitation of the time constraint.

0385737424|4.0|This one had me glued to the page so much I even read it during commercial breaks in the World Series--and I am an ardent Phillies fan!  :-)  Naturally, anyone who loves Madeleine L'Engle will love this book.  Like L'Engle's works, though, I think we will find that this book's appeal will be mainly for girls, though if a boy would try it, he would enjoy the whole time-travel theme.  It seems like, if the protagonist is female, the readership will be, also.  This is a shame, in the case of this book, because it is a fascinating story of L'Engle's \\"tessering\\" neatly inserted into \\"reality.\\"
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Well, I am not a great Fan of Movies which has a story line covering Zombies, any way 'I am Legend' has taken a different approach. This movie is based on novel by Richard Matheson of the same name.<br /><br />Synopsis : The Movie starts with a flashback where it is revealed that in 2009 a genetically Re-engineered Measles Virus was created to cure Cancer; later on this Virus undergoes mutation and generates a new lethal airborne based disease which spreads worldwide killing ninety percent of those infected, while the remaining few percent who possessed natural immunity to this virus survived rest turned to a aggressive primal beings who were not able to tolerate Sun Light thus forcing them to hide in the dark till dusk. Slowly most of this immune people where hunted by the infected thus making the central character (Will Smith) as the lone survivor of the holocaust.<br /><br />Will Smith plays as Dr. Robert Neville a US Army Scientist who posses the natural immunity against this airborne disease. He seems to have decided to stay back in Manhattan and try to find a possible cure. His daily day to day routine includes moving across the lonely Manhattan in the day time for hunting and gathering foods while in the night he works in his Lab trying to find a cure. He also waits every day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, where he instructs any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. The only sanity in him is seemed to be kept alive by his only companion 'Samantha' a canine.<br /><br />Very soon his survival becomes difficult, as his once fortified home at Washington Square becomes an imminent attack spot by a group of the Infected. Within the course of time Smith teams up with a woman named Anna and a small boy named Ethan who save him from a night road assault. The movie ultimately winds up with the cure resulting from his blood and Neville's(Smith)sacrifice to protect it.<br /><br />Well I think the whole movie pulled up well with the extraordinary performance by Will Smith. The movies first forty minutes has been really a riveting experience, it just gave us a haunting look of the lonely Manhattan.<br /><br />Though CGI created infected looked a little bit annoying, the overall experience was good. This movie is very much similar to Castaway where Tom Hanks portrays a person marooned in an island. 'I am Legend' may have received mixed reviews from across the world; after all it can be justified as portrayal of person's psychology against all odds and his belief. So in one way the movie has been able to deliver what it had to offer in the first place. If you are looking for lots of action then this movie may not be the right choice; if you are looking for drama with a dark theme then this just proves to do so.<br /><br />If there is no solid ground which rationalizes for watching this film, then Will Smith's performance is ample enough to give this movie a chance.<br /><br />I will rate it 7/10<br /><br />Could have been better...........aordinary performance by Will Smith.

B001F7AXKE|3.0|The strength of this book is the story it tells.  How it is told is the weakness.  The change in the point of view of the main character after Sarah finds her brother - after being with her through so much horror - was a disconnect for me.  I went from being completely engrossed to not - in one chapter.  The ending was too wrapped up as well.  I agree with another reader - I would have liked to follow Sarah to the US and experience her life there - and understand her choice to leave her son - which on some levels doesn't make sense - depite her profound depression.  It gets 4 stars for the first half of the book and 2 stars for the last half.
0307236722|5.0|I looked at a lot of baking books before settling on this one, and the main reason I chose it was all of the great pictures.  I'm not talking about just pictures of the finished product, which can certainly be helpful, but this book actually has clear step-by-step pictures of the techniques.  Especially with some of the more complicated things, like the pastries, the pictures can really take away the intimidation to try a new recipe.<br /><br />So far I have not encountered any problems with ingredients that a few people have mentioned.
0375842209|5.0|This book is a \\"must read\\".  The characters in the book are developed in such an interesting way.  It's a book that I wanted to keep on reading and yet at times I had to ponder the contents.  I belong to a book club and we will be discussing it soon.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|First, I am a Big fan of Michael Buble, and I have thoroughly enjoyed his releases. And about 2/3 of this CD is really comfortable and smooth. BUT, the first 2 tracks Cry Me a River and All Of Me are painfully ..well..Cheesy. It hurts me to say it.  But, the title track is Micheal at his best. I thought it would be a big hurdle for someone to do it justice for me, after Aaron Neville. He has succeeded!I also enjoyed Baby, You've Got What It Takes and Haven't Met you Yet.  But, I have to say my favorite track on the CD is  Hold On. It is not classic Micheal. Yet, it is hauntingly smooth, emotionally filling and  I think very memorable.
156895963X|3.0|I haven't being looking forward to reviewing this book. I honestly don't know what to give it. I feel almost guilty for giving it 3 stars. Nothing about this book really stands out to me. I don't understand Irish traditions and customs, nor do I really understand War torn Europe during World War II. And this books doesn't really help with any of that. I keep waiting for someone to admit this is a exaggerated fabrication of what life was really like. I have to admit every time the drunken father shows up I'm reminded of an episode of Family Guy. Plus, I'm curious were did the father go? Am I suppose to feel in awe of this young boy who made something of himself by saving money stolen from an elderly women? Does it make his story more interesting than those who weren't able to escape poverty? I just don't know.... I do want to know what happened when he reached America, but I'm not sure I will read the next one.

0786838655|4.0|I've always been interested in Greek mythology, so this book caught my eye really quick!  The story is extremely simple, which is not suprising since it is written for middle schoolers.  But, it was a fun and fast read.  My only issues were the ease in which the problems were solved and the mythology presented in the book.  For example, why would a 6th grader be able to take out a minotaur so easily?  And then beat Ares, the God of War, in a battle?  There was also a lot of mythology introduced in this book, with little explanation behind it.  I knew most if because I've studied Greek mythology in high school and in college.  But, how much of this would the average middle schooler know?  Still, a very fun way to introduce mythology to young readers!  I'll continue on with the series.
0312330871|5.0|I first read this book when I was in early high school and it made an impression on me as a \\"perfect\\" mystery (at that time I read it under the title, \\"Ten Little Indians\\").  I have re-read it many times since then and it is still one of my favorite mysteries of all time!  Christie wove the details of this story together elegantly and I loved how each detail fit perfectly into the overall story.  The characters were diverse and believable and the murders (while not gory) made me glance over my shoulder a few times as I read along.  I love that the \\"mystery\\" is finally explained at the end and each time I read it, I still flip back after I finish to see if it all \\"fits.\\"  Love this book!
B001DUJNGS|2.0|The newest album of Enigma \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\" by Michael Cretu is not one of his best and found myself dissapointed after listening to it. I still have the cd but very rarely listen to it. Hi hope that if Mr. Cretu plans on coming out with another album in the near future it sounds better than this one. The cover for the album is very cool and that's about all it has going for it and so I gave this one 2 stars whereas many of the previous albums I would give a solid 5.
0385341008|5.0|I had heard much about this book and saw it on many best seller lists, but I was determined not to read it (call me a rebel).  I ended up buying it for myself to support our school's book fair and started reading it right away.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that I couldn't put it down!  The story is told in letter format and centers around the character Juliet who is an author from London.  The first few letters were confusing for me.  Several characters have names starting with the same letter and that was hard to get straight at first.  Also, several characters have names that do not clearly indicate their gender which also confused me at first (FYI - Sidney is a man; so is Dawsey).<br /><br />But once I started reading the letters and seeing the story take shape I loved it!  At parts I sat reading with the book in front of my face as I grinned behind the pages at the events and characters.  At other times I hid myself behind the book to hide my tears as events unfolded which tugged at my heart-strings.<br /><br />It was a bit predictable but there was enough to surprise me that it never felt stale and I wanted to see how the story would \\"play out.\\"  I highly recommend this pleasant book for an easy read about intriguing characters in an interesting setting.
B000GCFO08|2.0|An excellent portrayal of how people can be terrorized into committing horrible crimes. Being an atheist I often wondered what it would be like to be branded as a heretic and burned alive at the stake by the church like what has happened throughout history. I wonder no more -- This movie did an excellent job of portraying just that. One might counter \\"we don't burn people at the stake anymore and beside this was only a movie -- this is the 21st century. WRONG. In 1952 a man was burned at the stake in Spain. Also a pacifist I again wonder how one could forgive a church who did things like this to their children. There seems to be no limit to the cruelty portrayed in this movie and its parallel to real life. It reminds me of the brazen bull; a device used during the beginning of the Christian era in which whole families including children were placed inside and roasted to death. I would like to believe these are isolated incidents and this sort of rare event could not happen to me or another person who disagrees with a church or religion. But then who wants to be part of a rare event that ends their life by being burned to death.

0393327655|2.0|Lots of heat, no light, and even less enlightenment.    Well written, forcefully argued, and his programme (to which he is currently devoting his Ph.D. studies) of studying mystical experience with a view to  accommodating it to a rational viewpoint is thoroughly admirable and long  overdue.Unfortunately, he gets the relationship between group  identity and religion precisely back to front, and justifies this error by  cherry picking the data. Worse, he totally fails to appreciate the  conflicts within religions, and in particular the conflict between  sophisticates (whom he mislabels \\"moderates\\") and literalists. As a  result, he misdiagnoses our current situation, and draws his battle lines  (and he does really mean battle) in the wrong places. He urges us, among  other things, to take the words of religious texts seriously. If we opponents of religious privilege and unreason take Harris's words seriously, we will draw our battle lines in such a way that we regard Francis Collins, Karen Armstrong, and even Stephen Jay Gould as among our enemies, in the same camp as Pat Robertson and Osama bin Laden. This is not a winning strategy, nor does it deserve to be.     Some specifics: Harris assumes that a suicide bomber must be a Moslem. Yet the suicide bombers who assassinated an Indian Prime Minister (Rajiv Gandhi) and  a Sri Lankan President (Ranasinghe Premadasa) were from the secularist Tamil Tigers, drawn from a mainly Hindu Sri Lankan ethnic minority. The kamikaze pilots  of World War II, being Japanese, may have been Buddhist, or Shinto, or  even Christian, that will certainly not have been Moslem. there is no shortage of other counter-examples, and no sign of awareness of how much violence in the Islamic world is between one Moslem group and another. Deplorable, certainly, but not in quite the way he believes.     He is equally selective in his choice of conflicts, with an  impressive list of those that involve groups with different religious  identities, whileconveniently omitting the most horrific conflicts of the modern period, none of which were driven by religion; the ongoing horrors of Central Africa, both World Wars, the wars in Vietnam and Korea, and the American Civil War.     Worst of all is his characterisation of religious \\"moderates\\" as  apologists for the literalist claim that sacred texts were written by God.  The very opposite is the case; such people commonly take the view that the  texts are a historical record of spiritual striving and development, and  reflect human imperfection as well as divine inspiration. Thus Harris  sneers at Bill Moyers, an American TV expounder of ideas, for hosting a  series examining the possible interpretations of the Book of Genesis. Yet  surely this is something that he as a non-believer should welcome; a historical  and literary analysis of a document of major significance in our culture,  thereby exposing the bankruptcy of literalism and its offspring, the  anti-educational and anti-scientific doctrine of Creationism.     For most people, religious identity is part of personal and group  identity, and it is identity that drives belief, not the other way round.  Thus in the late 19thth century, we had German Jews adopting Christianity, not because they had suddenly been persuaded that Jesus really was the Messiah after all, but in order to assert (tragic irony, in view of what happened later) their German identity. Today we have the children of Hispanic immigrants to the US joining evangelical churches, not because they have lost confidence in the Pope but because they see this as part of the process of becoming fully American. The  \\"moderate\\" position that so arouses Harris's hostility provides a way for  people to retain the group identity conferred by religion, while gently  letting go of the logical and moral absurdities that the religion itself  implies.     I say nothing about Harris's defence of torture, or about the bellicose hollowness of his declaration that \\"Weare at war with Islam\\" (does he want to intern my newsagent?) and his denunciation of religious tolerance (should we make prayer illegal?), all of which stem from his principled absolutism.

0756405890|5.0|Believe all of the good things you hear about this book, they are all true.<br /><br />I wasn't interested in this book after reading the title and a few reviews because it seemed like it was a very long book about nothing. I thought the storytelling aspect wouldn't appeal to me either, but it seems I was mistaken. As mentioned in other reviews, this is a book about the life of a man named Kvothe. The Name of the Wind is comprised of his youth and teenage years, the largest part being his stint at the university. I love books about magic students and people learning new skills, so I was very pleasantly surprised that this novel was largely about that. Kovthe is now an innkeeper and definitely has something hiding under his pleasant exterior. His tale is compelling. It may be depressing at times, but there is just the right amount of good fortune and fun mixed in to keep you entertained. Kvothe is extremely intelligent and picks up most subjects very easily. I personally enjoy his intelligence and love to see him excel, but it also makes him inpatient, stubborn, and over confident. He is certainly not a perfect human being, and that is very refreshing.<br /><br />The storytelling is masterful and I loved every word. Every little thing Kvothe did seemed amazing. I think I could have read about him eating an apple for 40 pages and been content. It's hard to explain exactly what it was that made this book so amazing, yet I say that is a good thing. It is so good that I won't cheapen the review with technicalities. The sentence structure, setting, and such does not concern me. This book is a story about magic, about life, and about Kvothe, and it's great. The Name of the Wind is about growing up, finding love, falling, and picking yourself back up again. There is so much depth in such a simple story, it is amazing. If you were ever curious about what the hype is all about you will have to see for yourself.

B002MW50KO|1.0|As one previous reviewer summed it up: \\"Yikes!\\" I love Dylan as much as anyone, but this is awful, just downright awful.

0439023483|5.0|I was skeptical at first, picking up this book. The cover seemed like one of those classic \\"super-spy, action-packed\\" books that I don't enjoy very much. Then I read the inside cover, and the plot drew me in immediately. It seemed like a good book, just from that. And so I read on.    In the remains of North America, a new nation pulled together, consisting of thirteen districts and one Capitol. Each district specialized in one resource, and it might have worked. But then there were rebellions-- people living in the lesser districts rose up against the Government. In return, the President annihilated the thirteenth district, to show domination over the country. Not only that... He created the Hunger Games. A Game in which two children from each district battle to the death, and the last man alive wins. When a young girl is chosen for district 12, her sister, Katniss Everdeen, volunteers to take her place. She doesn't expect that an old childhood friend would be drawn with her. The Government's cruel tricks and Katniss's cleverness leads to a wonderful plot, and, ultimately, great book-- now one of my favorites.

B002OB9KPE|4.0|It only took a couple of listens to fall in love with the \\"The Whirlwind\\". Transatlantic is back after too long of an absence with a stellar CD.     Some are put off by a single 73 minute piece of music, even true prog heads, but the CD it is divided into 12 distinct pieces of music, each with its own sound and vibe. It should be said that each piece does flow naturally and smoothly into the next with the transitions subtle. But without watching the track numbers you CAN tell when you move into a different segment. Very nice!     Much has already been said about the mix. Some call it \\"sterile\\" some say it is better than the two previous Transatlantic releases. One thing that all the positive reviews say (myself included) is the way Roine's guitar and Pete's bass work really stand out on this CD. Pete's bass is probably the most noticeable. You can finally hear was a fantastic bassist he is; so smooth and rhythmic. His work is really showcased on cut 3 \\"On The Prowl\\".     Neal Morse still gets his preaching in, and at times it is not so subtle. Personally, I like the positive themes that are pretty consistent with Transatlantic music. Having no idea what Roine's faith is, his Flower Kings music is also consistently uplifting.   Keep in mind that Transatlantic is primarily a Neal Morse project.   This work really spreads the vocal duties around a lot more than the previous. Actually, the first voice you hear is Roine's and even Pete gets to sing.     What can you say about Mike that hasn't already been said. One of the top drummers in the world today.    The second CD is what it is. To quote John Belushi from \\"Animal House\\" Hey why not, it don't cost nothing\\".    The first song from Roine \\"Spinning\\" is pretty decent, but after that only the covers of \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" (Genesis) and \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" (Santana) are worth repeated listening. I wasn't even that thrilled with their cover of Genesis' \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\". I thought they would do more with it: maybe interpret it differently. It is pretty much just a straight cover. But, as mentioned, worth additional listens.    Speaking of Genesis interpretations, do your self a favor and check out former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett's 2004 release \\"Genesis Revisited\\". Each song is a totally new interpretation of some Genesis classics with the liner notes explaining his interpretations. Great stuff!    I don't hand out the 5 stars too often but a 4 star is still a must buy from this old prog lover!
B000035Z3K|5.0|This set is so inexpensive, yet you get such a great bang for your buck!      Lugosi is mightily impressive as Dracula.  No Dracula since has been anywhere near as good.  He's tall, he's from Romania, he's imposing, he has a piercing stare - what more could you ask?      The new music score by Philip Glass is a fine complement to Lugosi's great performance.  For some reason, maybe because of tight money in the early years of the Great Depression, the initial release featured no original music at all.  Glass's score enhances the drama and makes the film far more exciting than the music-less version.      Glass is one of the best living composers in the world and he shows why with this score.  His repeated patterns build a high level of tension and he elevates the tension brilliantly during the big moments.      The music is performed by the Kronos Quartet, one of the finest string quartets in the world.  Glass and the Kronos Quartet show that you don't need a studio orchestra to make great film music.  Unless you don't really like music at all, you will want to watch the film with this magnificent score.    As for the other elements of the film, the other actors are fine, though not special, save for the wonderfully campy Dwight Frye as Renfield and Charles Gerrard providing comic relief as Martin.  The cinematography is great, the sets are great, the script is good and Tod Browning's direction is at least adequate.    Still, the main reason to watch this production is for Lugosi's iconic performance, brilliantly complemented by Glass's music.  Bravo!

B001AEF6C2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    One of those 80s teen films that was never really that good in the first place but people all pretend is a classic, Weird Science is a film designed for 12 year old boys (and I don't mean that pejoratively) who will no doubt find its wish-fulfillment-loaded plot interesting instead of rather juvenile; parts of the movie are cute and made me fondly remember the days where seeing the naked female form and impressing kids in school were numbers 1 and 2 on my priority list, but nostalgia aside the film is rather mediocre.    2.5/4
B00001IVR0|5.0|Brahms' second Piano Concerto has long been a favorite of mine, and I own many recordings of this old warhorse. My absolute favorite stereo versions have been [[ASIN:B000001GQY Gilels/Jochum/BPO]], [[ASIN:B0000029YK Fleisher/Szell/CO]], and [[ASIN:B0009ORGJA Anda/Fricsay/BPO]]. Well, I'd have to add this recording to the list of seminal interpretations. I don't often think much of Bohm's Brahms, but he is in absolutely fine form here, clearly illuminating Brahms' many musical lines and providing excellent dialogue with the soloist in this, the very definition of the symphony-concerto. Bohm has a special relationship with the VPO, and they display their characteristic warm tone and almost innate mastery of this repetoire throughout, playing nearly flawlessly and framing a perfect backdrop for the soloist. There might be one flat spot from the woodwinds at the end of the first movement, but it's a minor blemish.    And Backhaus...what can I say about Backhaus? Both he and Bohm share a grand view as to how to conceive this work, and their shared vision leads to a fully cohesive and brilliantly executed performance from start to finish. At the ripe old age of 83, Backhaus outdoes many performances of more widely acclaimed artists many years his junior. His playing is noble and patrician, and never sounds taxed or laborious as he expertly charts the myriad obstacles Brahms presents the soloist here with ease. One senses a wealth of power lingering just below the surface of his playing. His interpretation is always in complete service of the music, never using his skills for showing off but rather choosing to display epic virtuosity on a much grander scale. I am astounded by what he accomplished on this record, and that a man with his wealth of experience was able to retain his technical abilities so far into his autumn years.    For sake of comparison, I still prefer the DGG Gilels recording above all, and in contrast this recording eschews the ultra-legato approach employed by Jochum, instead favoring less dynamic phrasing and slightly less tempo modulation. It is probably more similar in approach to the Fleisher recording, yet somewhere in the middle of the two in terms of total time. While it isn't my personal first choice, I could easily see it being that for many others, and it is a recording I plan on revisiting frequently.    The sound here is excellent on the Brahms recording, expertly captured by Decca's engineers. Sound is vintage, a warm and full late-60's analog. The Mozart here is from 1955, in mono, and is less sonically pleasing, though also a very fine interpretation if not a truly great one. Bohm was a well-regarded Mozartian and Backhaus offers an refined and aristocratic reading, but there are better versions available, most notably [[ASIN:B00005MJ15 Gilels/Bohm/VPO]] and [[ASIN:B00006JR16 Anda]] conducting the Salzburg Mozarteum. The liner notes are well-written and informative, if slightly brief.    Highly recommended. If you've not heard Backhaus before, I suggest you do so quickly. He is not well-known this side of the Atlantic, but he was one of the last of the true piano giants of the 20th century. This magical performance is an excellent way to get acquainted with his great artistry.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A long film that doesn't feel long, Watchmen is an astonishing visual experience (for all his faults director Zach Snyder sure can craft a pretty frame) that has its flaws--the scenes with Rorschach work far better than anything with Matthew Goode or Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman, some of the flashbacks don't make much sense to neophytes--but Jackie Earle Haley is great, the CGI is very effective, and the film works as *spectacle* even when it fails a little as a story; no one can deny that Watchman has issues, but it succeeds despite them.      3/4
B0029O08WA|1.0|A colleague of mine let me borrow this recently.  I have listened, no I have tried to listen to it 2 times.  All I have to say is blah.  It is so much of the same thing.  70% of the vocals sound like someone at the soundboard had no idea how to improve the volume.  Some of the songs downright stink.  I wouldn't give you 50 cents for them and I wouldn't give you $1 to see the band perform them live.  Really.  I know that New Moon the book starts out depressive due to the story line, but really, lets have the WHOLE soundtrack follow that same depressive, down theme.  You can't tell me there aren't some upbeat sections in the movie that deserve better music that this.  Let's not forget that I have only heard of two of the bands on the soundtrack.  If one compares this to the original Twilight soundtrack, there is CLEARLY a winner, and it's Twilight.  If there is still time for people in the editing room for the movie to add new, more UPBEAT music to the movie, Get to work!!!  This stinks.  Try again.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Just picked up the mono set today, I have had the stereo set since it was released. Early impression is that everything through Rubber Soul sounds better in mono, sometimes to an extent that is stunning (Paperback writer). From Sgt. Pepper on, it is no contest, stereo is much better.     Best bet is get the mono set & but the rest of the albums individually. Both box sets was a big bite, but worth it to me.    Have no clue where the people that say the remasters are crap are coming from. I have a 15K stereo and a very good ear. The remasters are manna from heaven. The 80's CD were so bad I stopped listening to them long ago.      I grew up listening to original vinyl on my dad's excellent hi-fi (Fisher, AR, Gerard) back when the band was still together, so I have a pretty good idea of what The Beatles are supposed to sound like. Keep in mind that these recordings were done under conditions that are pretty primitive by today's standards. The Beatles were always busy inventing the future, but they did not stay together long enough to really reap the sonic benefits of the ground they broke.    It is kind of a rip that the mono mixes were not simply included on one CD per record, as on the Capitol remasters.
0061124265|2.0|I've been hearing some great things about Paulo Coelho, but none of his books interested me enough to check them out. Then I saw this book in the bookstore and thought it might be a good read. I love stories about disillusionment with life. But I still hesitated because the author is known for writing \\"inspirational\\" fiction. And then I found out that they were making a movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar as the main character, so I had to read it.<br /><br />And now I see that my initial hesitations were correct. The book started off well enough but then the author introduces himself into the story for about two pages. By the end of the book I was wondering: \\"Why?\\" There was no need for the author to be in the book, and it only served to be an annoying distraction. The rest of the book felt pretty \\"flat\\" to me. The writing didn't come off the page the way good writing does. It just felt like words on a page most of the time. Besides chapters about Veronika and the other characters, there were three long chapters that focused on three different characters and their problems. The chapter about Zedka and depression was OK. I liked the part about astral projection though it went nowhere in terms of the story. The chapter about Mari and panic attacks was unbearable. It felt like I was a reading a textbook example of the disorder. The most enjoyable part of the whole book was the chapter about Eduard the \\"schizophrenic\\" (highly unlikely from what I've read), and I think that's because the author had a similar experience with his parents when he was growing up. The ending was pretty much what sealed the deal for me that this wasn't a very good novel. It felt inauthentic and I had a suspicion that that's the direction the author was going in, I just hoped he wouldn't be so predictable. If the novel ended on page 204 (in my edition, this means the last two chapters would be cut) I would have given it three stars.<br /><br />Overall, it felt like I was reading someone's thoughts about madness rather than a story about a particular character. I think this book fails completely as a novel. The writing is average at best, the characters are one-dimensional, and the story is barely there and quite predictable.<br /><br />If you want to read some good fiction dealing with suicide and depression, I recommend \\"Suicide Notes\\" by Michael Thomas Ford and \\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />I'll still watch the movie (probably on DVD), just to see how they handled adapting this novel.s rather than a story about a particular character.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|October 30th, 2009<br /><br />Songs such as the longing of 'City' and calmness of 'Between The Lines' set the mood perfectly. 'Love Song', 'One Sweet Love' and 'Come Round Soon' are also very solid tracks. The delight that is 'Many The Miles' and the sadness of 'Gravity' pull you in (no pun intended). And the piano in 'Love On The Rocks' is pretty cool. But on the disc (for said song), Sara didn't even play it; Jamie Muhoberac did.<br /><br />I just got the actual CD today and 'Morningside' is filler to me. But the rest of the tracks are OK, but nothing great. 'Bottle It Up', the second single off the album was never a track I loved, but it is OK. I did always like how she uses the s-word in said song.<br /><br />Inside the booklet, it says who played what instrument in the beginning of the lyrics to each song and it also lets you know that Sara Bareilles wrote every track by herself towards the end of the booklet, except 'Love On The Rocks' which was co-written by Javier Dunn.<br /><br />4 stars from me.<br /><br />Download:<br />City<br />Love On The Rocks<br />Many The Miles<br />Gravity<br />Love Song<br /><br />Edit: Wiki says that Sara is working hard on her next project and she is collaborating with Questlove from The experimental rap group The Roots. There is no due date so far. I would like to see her do an R&B-flavored song or two, but I actually don't want her to change up her style completely. I think if she crafts what she works with, she can come even harder with her sophomore effort. Also, Morningside and Fairytale are better to me now.
0385504225|5.0|Plausibility aside, I loved this book for a few simple reasons:    (1) it is a wonderful \\"guilty pleasure\\" or great escapism;    (2) it is extremely fast-paced and fun/easy to read;   (3) I found it much more interesting than \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angles and Demons\\"; (4) it had the perfect amount of twists and turns, one of which completely shocked me;   (5) the ending truly satisfied me; and   (6) I walked away from it feeling I learned something new.      While at times I'll admit there was a little too much \\"teaching\\" for my taste, and I felt the author tried too hard to impress with the tremendous amount of research he had done, I really can't complain because of the six reasons I listed above. (And because I respect the fact that so much research and thought went into writing the novel.)       I highly recommend the book and am a bit surprised so many people didn't love it like I did. Therefore, I would recommend approaching it with an open mind and remembering its a work of fiction.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|WOW! I absolutely loved this movie! it's raw, honest, funny and so endearing at times. He is so soft-spoken yet absolutely on point. He is a genius and a true icon and yet he was so down to earth and humble!     He did hold back on dancing quite a bit but his voice: BEAUTIFUL!     I've seen it 5 times already in theather and twice in IMAX. YOU HAVE TO DO IMAX it feels like you are sucked in to the screen!!     Every time, I noticed what a beautiful person he was and his cute comments and sexy expressions... the Man still had sex appeal... SEXY! SIZZLING ;)      STAY until all the credits roll up because there is an extra clip -> very special!      I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MICHAEL JACKSON! This movie is an amazing tribute!     Long Live the KING OF MUSIC!!!!!!!
B00003XAQ5|5.0|I can hear the cries from the audiophiles now -- \\"Kind of Blue in Surround Sound... They've ruined it!\\" But in fact \\"they\\" haven't. As one of the most high-profile releases in the growing catalog of SACD, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue has been gently remixed for SACD in a multi-channel format that takes advantage of additional speakers (mostly front speakers) to create a wider and more open soundstage for an album that every true music enthusiast owns (possibly in several editions).<br /><br />The fear of a bad multi-channel mix is understandable, considering what could be done with this artistic performance. With the power to put John Coltrane ping-ponging in the rear speakers, it takes restraint, taste and respect to avoid overpowering the recorded performance with audio trickery. That restraint and taste are just what you will find on this SACD. The center channel is used to add height and width to the sound stage. In direct comparisons to a number of versions of remixed Kind of Blue that I own on CD, the SACD clearly takes the cake. No matter how well your speakers are angled for optimum imaging, you simply cannot get the stereo version to spread out the way you will hear it do on the SACD. I found it fun to highlight the differences for some friends over for cocktails recently. They think I am a bit crazy with all of my audio talk, but when they sat down to listen to the differences they could hear them clearly.<br /><br />I found that having additional space around the instruments brought to life new subtle details on a record where I thought I knew all of the subtle details. You can hear James Cobb spin his brushes on cymbals with such detail that you feel like you can hear the angle for which he attacks his set. The additional resolution from the SACD leads to increased overall smoothness in the sound without giving up one ounce of clarity. This is a definite advantage of SACD over CD or even LP (we aren't still talking about LP, are we?). When Davis mutes his trumpet, you can hear the tone get brighter, but it is never shrill or overpowering. While this never was a problem for me on past CD versions of the album, the additional resolution from the SACD format and an excellent mix makes the virtuoso performance just that much better.<br /><br />As far as the songs on the record go, you likely know them all by heart already. If you are buying or have invested in an SACD player at this point, it is very unlikely that you are unfamiliar with Kind of Blue. It is one of, if not the, most influential jazz records of all time and should be considered art, as well as a national treasure. Notable on the SACD version of the album is an alternate take of the last track, \\"Flamenco Sketches,\\" which isn't found on most CD versions of Kind of Blue.<br /><br />The SACD remix was compiled from master tapes, using an all-tube, three-track machine, which was reportedly the type used for the original mix. Another improvement on the SACD release is correction of the tape speed, which fixes a pitch problem that caused musicians trying to play along with the record to end up pulling out their hair in frustration. As a guitar player, I never had the urge to try to play along with Kind of Blue, but I surmise that the improvements made in the pitch of the album, along with other improvements, all add up to the discernable difference you can hear on the SACD version.<br /><br />This record alone makes a strong argument as to why one could consider starting to upgrade their collection from CD to higher-resolution formats like SACD. The careful work done to remix and master the record, paired with the beautiful audio heard on SACD, makes it a must-own for any music lover, jazz fan and/or audio enthusiast. If it requires the investment in a new player, consider it a worthy expenditure to get this much closer to an important performance. -- Jerry Del Colliano, August 2001hear the tone get brighter, but it is never shrill or overpowering.

B0000TB014|5.0|OK so this is essentially a collection of his top music videos! I know some of them are redundant especially if you have History Vol 1 and 2 BUT you should really get this. Why? DIRTY DIANA music video alone makes this a worthy purchase AND You Rock My World!!!     No other DVDs have these two music videos! He looks super hot and sexy in Dirty Diana music video so that alone is your reason to get this dvd!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Just as good as the one that came with my PS3 only cheaper than it would have been in stores.
B0026ICMLO|5.0|What a nice upgrade for the \\"fairest of them all\\".  I love the new Disneyview art panels that are optional, although I wish we had the option of just using the curtains from the opening if so desired to create the vintage theatre experience.<br /><br />All of the extras are wonderful, however it does NOT contain everything from the original DVD release, so if you have that, hold on to it.  Great new extras almost make up for the deletions.
B001Q8FRNK|5.0|this is one of the best albums ever made.  period.  BUT, i have one problem with light in the attic's vinyl reissue: the breaking up of the original album (each side was shortened and \\"blast off\\" and \\"that's my girl\\" were put on the second record).  i guess they thought they needed to (apparently) beef up the second record?  but any monks fan would care more about the music than the way the track list appeared.  i was hoping for a copy of the original album as it was originally heard and meant to be heard with the bonus tracks on the second disc.  i may just be an uptight nerd, but i view this album as an important historical document and i guess i was just hoping for a kind of replica.  but all in all, it's really not THAT big of a deal...it's still \\"black monk time\\" on vinyl...and that's good enough for me.  oh, and \\"pretty suzanne\\" and \\"monk chant\\" add an extra punch to the bonus tracks.  if you prefer the sound of \\"black monk time\\" to the following poppier singles, you won't be disappointed by these two tracks.

When all of the other board books have been given away, Boynton has a treasured place on our shelves.    The whimsy, silliness, and sensitivity of the books are a delight to child and adult alike.

1423113497|4.0|Almost as well crafted as the Potter series, \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" is full of adventure and suspense, heroic deeds and triumphs. Imagine being a 10-year-old in modern US who suddenly discovers that his life depends on understanding Greek mythology--because all those gods are relatives, and one is your dad. Percy has to fight off monsters and discover some truths about himself along the way.   The books bring a delightful turn to learning the Greek myths, and the premise works. Placing Mount Olympus in Modern New York City (600th floor of the Empire State Building) --and Hades in Los Angeles--sets up a whole new look at American culture from the point of view of a young person just trying to figure life out.  My daughter and I gulped the first three books down in less than 2 weeks. She's discovered the whole new richness of Greek mythology for the first time and I am having great fun remembering it all.  You need to read the first book before the movie comes out! You'll be glad you did.
B00007KWI9|4.0|Having been a Yes fan since the beginning, I picked up this CD to fill out my digital collection of the Yes catalog, having acquired much of the early catalog on LP's beginning in the early 70's.  This recording does not dissapoint.  The alternate takes included on this CD make for a glimpse into what was going on in the band at the time and are fun to hear.  I reccommend the CD.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Jim Henson's muppetry really puts most modern CGI to shame.  This is a timeless classic that should be a wakeup call to all of the garbage that is coming out of holywood these days.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|The Blu Ray is released Nov 17th. So how am I writing this review on Oct 30th? Well...for some reason Australia's been getting Star Trek Blu Ray releases well ahead of US dates. We got the Original 6 movie Blu Ray set several weeks before the US release and here we are at nearly 3 weeks ahead of the US with the new Star Trek Movie.    And you're wondering...how is it?  Not bad...But did it knock my socks off? Nope...not really...no. Should you buy it? YES!    What's the problem?  Muted colors. The film has a kind of browny, sandy washed out look to it. If I remember correctly, in the cinema the film looked more stunning. The bridge of the enterprise had a clean glassy and super colorful look to it. On Blu Ray, The reds, yellows and blues of the uniforms don't have the same striking color - they look dull and washed out. Skin tones are more grey and brown here with a hint of blue. Disappointing  The Blu Ray lacks that visual pop of the better recent releases. Think the intro sequence for Watchmen (stylised but stunning). This image is kind of soft and inconsistent. Some scenes are sharper, others flatter and softer. The space battle scenes should look a heck of a lot better. Given the kinetic energy of the movie, especially in combat, the detail can tend to get lost in the softness. You'll know there's a problem in the opening scenes with George Kirk with all the worst quaities I describe here.  Lot of people here commented on the lousy image quality of the original 6 movies on Blu Ray. In my book, at least the original Star Trek the motion picture on blu ray looks better than this.     Also, this film wins the award, hands down for the most overuse of lens flair...ever. If you don't believe me, check it out when you get it. You'll count at least 75% of the shots with some excessive flare glare on the screen. This is a major distration. Lens flare drowns out detail, overblows contrast frequently, etc etc. Related to this, the film also shows the worst elements of theanamorphic film process (drifting focus, exacerbated by those damned lens flares!!). JJ here's a tip. Please find yourself a new cinematographer!    Ok that's it for the rant. Let's get onto the good stuff.  This movie sounds damn good. Here's the thing - there's less surround whiz bang than you would expect but the sound mix is very good and highly effective. Dialogue is exceptionally clear. You can watch this move at a low level and still enjoy the dynamic range and hear every word of what is said. Important for us with a little baby at home. :) The music mix is subtle and smooth, and striking when it needs to be. Crank it up and you've got a great action movie soundtrack.     Despite what I said above the picture is not bad. There's no edge enhancement, there's no compression artifacts, there's no excessive grain and I have not noticed any noise reduction (or at least no excessive DNR). As a result there's no static grain pattern that I noticed. Shadow detail looks good, without excessive black crush. In summary apart from those damn lens flares (sorry last reference) it's watchable.    So should you buy it? Absolutely but please don't expect fireworks on the picture front and it will do the job. Besides, whatever issues there are with the picture, the DVD would be worse and it's not like you want to wait a few years for this be re-released again. I'm sure Paramount knows this. Whether this disc is an outstanding or an ok transfer, it will sell by the truckload.    Oh, and by the way the movie is really good. But you already knew that from the other reviews...    Enjoy
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Wow...it's amazing how this girl can write so many awesome songs! This platinum edition CD/DVD is a great value and perfect if you haven't bought Taylor's \\"Fearless\\" album yet -- but it's still a nice add to your collection even if you already own the original album. The CD is packed full with 19 songs, 6 of which are new (5 brand new + 1 acoustic remix) plus the DVD has hours of fun music videos and entertainment!<br /><br />The standout track to me is the piano version of \\"Forever And Always\\". It's such a nice and simple acoustic performance...but at the same time it's super powerful and awesome. All the songs are amazing, and the DVD is equally fun (it seriously has like 2 hours of music videos, tons of pictures, and exclusive behind the scenes clips!) I highly recommend getting this CD/DVD set as a gift for any Taylor Swift fan -- it's definitely worth your money!

B001RTP48Q|4.0|There are a lot of bands today that are trying to resurrect the 80's sound, yet the Pet Shop Boys were Actually there, and are still doing this kind of music better than anyone.<br /><br />A welcome return to their classic sound, \\"Yes\\" finds the Boys recovering from the malaise of their previous LP \\"Fundamental\\", which was quite good in its own way, yet at times was very somber and overly orchestral.<br /><br />\\"Yes' is full of the synthetic sweep and disco pulse that Neil and Chris have perfected in their 25-plus year career, and its general mood is more upbeat and positive than their other recent albums. Lead single \\"Love, etc.\\" is delightfully bitchy, and follow-up \\"Did You See Me Coming\\" is quite hooky and radio-friendly. And just listenening to standout tracks like \\"King of Rome\\" and \\"Pandemonium\\", you'll swear its 1987 again. These guys just own this genre, plain and simple.<br /><br />Although its doubtful that any new Pet Shop Boys music will get airplay in the USA, for their worldwide audience (and their built-in one here), \\"Yes\\" is the best release in years from these perennial disco divas.

B002TUETW4|2.0|The news is filled with stories of how brisk Michael's catalog and memorabilia is selling. Why then, oh why, does Sony and the Michael Jackson Estate insist on trying to rape his fans for more money. His \\"Number Ones\\", \\"The Essential\\" and a host of other compilations have been at the top of the charts since his transition. Word is now out that his debt-riddled finances will soon be in the black. So does the estate really need to make this pedestrian collection, an \\"album only\\" set if the fan only wants the new song.     After viewing the good, but not great documentary on him, the song, \\"This is It\\" sounded better than when I first heard it. But I am not going to buy yet another compilation just for one song. It leaves such a poor taste in his fans' mouths. His transitioning helped greatly to redeem his image. This makes it a bit tawdry, all over again.    Not only will Sony and the Michael Jackson Estate be hitting the fans up with not one, but 2 different DVDs of \\"This is It\\" in time for the holiday selling season. And then there is the \\"Opus\\" [...] for that has yet to arrive.    We are in a recession. His transitioning has been a gift to the music industry in its marketability......where is the sensitivity to that? That song had/has the potential to be a top selling track........still, they would rather sell the same song collection over and over again while robbing his fan base of yet more money.    I wont be buying  this album.........and unfortunately, if the song comes to me in another form, I will be tempted to join the ranks of illegal downloads.

The Savanah, Georgia boys' epic album is intense, powerful, progressive, heavy, melodic, mysterious. Red Album has all the elements to be marked as a must have for any rock fan.<br /><br />John Baizley and his bandmates showcase their musicianship and songwriting skills on trax like \\"Wanderlust\\", \\"The Birthing\\", and \\"Isak\\".  With hundreds of live shows under their belt, their sound is colossal and confident, something you would expect from a bands' 5th album. Baroness achieved this on their debut full length which is quite impressive.<br /><br />They're currently on a North American tour, and working on their highly anticipated new album.<br /><br />Listen to this album once, and you will appreciate it.  Listen to it a few more times, and it will be part of you.

0385504225|3.0|I enjoyed the book, took me a day to read it but honestly I did skip a few pages as they added nothing to the plot or the characters.  I did think Dan Brown was writing a screen play and I went along with him and pictured Tom Hanks walking through the story and that helped. I found myself also thinking of Nicholas Cage in National Treasure as I was reading it as well.  (sorry)  I did not understand Noetic Science but that was explained ad nauseum by the end of the book.<br /><br />But it is a good read though not worth the hardback price, I will wait for paperback version of any new book.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book simply because it was an interesting concept......
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|[Edited on 2/13/11]<br /><br />Say what you will about the screenplay, the acting, and other various complaints about the movies, one good thing this series has always had going for it was that whomever choses their music usually does one heck of a job. True, this soundtrack was a bit rocky as far as song placement in the movie, but they have progressively gotten better from New Moon to Eclipse (those soundtracks were really well done, in my opinion).<br /><br />As far as how to rate this soundtrack...well, it's a bit harder to say. I like a lot of the songs on here (there are definitely some great bands assembled on this album and I have to give respect for that) but many of them just don't match the scenes in which they were placed. So you have this great compilation of songs which makes for a great soundtrack in that regard. However, the point of a soundtrack is to have the music convey the emotions of the scene in which they play...and in that regard, this soundtrack falls short.<br />For example, Muse's song \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is about the singer being in love with someone who's \\"the queen of the superficial.\\" This song would have worked better in the beginning of the movie where Edward was still wearing his detached facade in front of Bella and when she was still trying to figure him out. Instead, it was put as background music to the baseball game, a time when Edward's family is being very open and honest with Bella about their abilities and letting her see \\"the real Cullen family.\\" I have much respect for Muse and I love this song, don't get me wrong. I just think the placement was off. I had the same complaint about Iron & Wine's song - beautiful song, but again the placement was kinda weird if you listen to the lyrics beyond what's in the movie. The same goes for \\"Eyes on Fire\\" - it's a GREAT song to be in a vampire movie and I adore this particular track. But the scene it was, again, off - it was as if they listened to the first few chords and thought it would make a great background tune. And in a way it did, but it could have been used SO much better than it was.<br /><br />I didn't like Rob Pattinson's song at first, but I have to admit that it kinda grew on me. I do prefer the song of his that they used while he was trying to save Bella after the attack at the end, though. Unfortunately, it's not on this CD and it's rather hard to find. It's totally worth the effort if you can find it elsewhere, though.<br />I have mixed feelings about Bella's lullaby. Like many other reviewers, I'd wanted something a bit less orchestral and something a bit more personal, especially considering how protective Edward is of her and how much he feels drawn to her. I was expecting something more like Yiruma's \\"River Flows In You.\\" However...this song did work for the scene it was in (amazingly enough, lol). And it does a good job of conveying the journey the characters have been through - the first minute and 12 seconds representing the emotional turmoil of their journey and the rest of the song conveying the blossoming feelings between them. The more I listened to it, the more I grew to like it.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this soundtrack because of the great songs that are on it - there's definitely some great tunes here. I just wouldn't waste time trying to associate them with the scenes they were inserted into in the movie.a great background tune.

B002S0OBFK|4.0|This movie had so much potential . . .  Here's where it went right and wrong:    RIGHT:  Overall storyline and concept is very good.  Micah offered great comical relief while at the same time antagonizing the demon.  Katie's agony and frustration over the whole experience was believable.   Good use of quiet thumps and BOOMS!  Generally slow, gradual build-up of suspense and tension. With each passing night you know it will only get worse.  Camera was jerky enough to seem realistic, but not *too* jerky. Fortunately at night the camera is stationary on a tripod.  A few good scenes that will make you wish you were a turtle or an ostrich with its head underground.  Little to no use of special effects.    WRONG:  Once again, the characters are stupid in response to the threat.   Not \\"Scream-at-the-screen\\" scary, as most of the terror depends on how vivid your imagination is.  Scarier things could have happened: The camera could have fallen over, blacking out the screen and paving the way for aural horror instead of visual.      OVERALL:  Instead of scaring me with \\"Boo!\\" this movie mostly made me go \\"Boo-Hoo\\", because although it does build suspense and tension really well, with a little bit of editing and common sense it could have been a whole lot better than it turned out.
0071636080|5.0|The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs is a book that a speechwriter can love. Gallo quotes from sources such as Nancy Duarte's [[ASIN:0596522347 slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations]] and Garr Reynolds' [[ASIN:0321525655 Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery]]. He even has a sidebar on JFK speechwriter Ted Sorensen's influence on Barack Obama titled, \\"What the World's Greatest Speechwriters Know.\\"<br /><br />The message of this book is that Jobs' extraordinary impact is based on his authenticity and his passion for his company's people and products. Most presenters can't claim to be the CEO of an archetypically cool Silicon Valley company.<br /><br />Neither can they get away with wearing faded jeans, sneakers and a turtleneck onstage. But simply everyone with a product or service that improves people's lives has a story to tell. Gallo's book explains in detail how Jobs presents his story so that his passion shines through and ignites the audience. It's Gallo's claim that anyone can learn how to deliver an \\"insanely great\\" presentations.<br /><br />The \\"secrets\\" that make Jobs so effective onstage include the usual stage tips taught by presentation coaches: Make eye contact with the audience, use vocal variety and know the power of a well-timed pause. But the majority of the book analyzes the structure, rather than the delivery techniques, of major keynotes Jobs has given at Macworld and elsewhere over the years. This makes the book of inestimable value for anyone who needs to understand the nuts and bolts of writing a speech.<br /><br />Performance piece<br /><br />When Steve Jobs takes to the stage he often tells dramatic stories, so it's appropriate that the book itself is structured as a three-act play. Act 1 tells how to create the story, Act 2 tells how to deliver it, and Act 3 stresses the importance of rehearsal. Gallo adds \\"Director's Notes\\" that summarize each chapter (or scene), and he introduces a cast of supporting characters.<br /><br />Organizing the book in this way also reinforces the importance of telling a story in three parts; of delivering a speech with three messages. In fact, Gallo concedes, the chapter on the effectiveness of breaking a speech into three \\"could easily have become the longest in the book.\\"<br /><br />Speechwriters' playbook<br /><br />The book is a playbook for writing a great speech. Jobs and his team start scripting a speech long before firing up PowerPoint or, in their case, Keynote software. They settle on an attention-grabbing headline (\\"The world's thinnest notebook\\"); then they decide on the three key messages; develop analogies and metaphors; and scope out demonstrations, video clips and cameo guest appearances.<br /><br />Next they develop the \\"plot\\" of the speech, setting up an antagonist (Microsoft or IBM in the early days), dressing up numbers and including plenty of \\"amazingly zippy\\" words. Finally, they script a memorable \\"holy smokes\\" moment that people will talk about long after the event ends. The slides they eventually create are heavy on images and light on text and bullet points.<br /><br />Live action video<br /><br />A book alone will go only so far. If you've never actually seen Jobs present in person, then you haven't experienced the \\"reality-distortion field\\" his charisma and eloquence creates in the auditorium. Gallo has this covered.<br /><br />The book's end notes provide URLs for some of the 47,000 [...] video clips showcasing Jobs and clearly demonstrating the techniques discussed. Viewing the videos compensates for the poor-quality monochrome photos of Jobs onstage-the one disappointment in the book.<br /><br />Learning from his mistakes<br /><br />To counteract any feelings of inadequacy you might have after watching Jobs deliver a flawless keynote, do a quick search on YouTube for \\"Apple Bloopers\\" and you'll see that, even for Steve Jobs, things don't always go well onstage. Demos fail, screens freeze, and he stumbles over words. But as with any masterful presenter, Jobs remains calm.<br /><br />Even if the speeches you write or deliver are not destined for \\"insane\\" greatness, they'll be much, much, better for having read Carmine Gallo's insanely great book.eze, and he stumbles over words.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love Christian Bale, and he is great as the Dark Knight. (um, hot hot hot) This movie is awesome, special effects and cinematography are amazing, acting is top notch, it is one of the greatest in the \\"Batman\\" franchise and that's all that really needs to be said.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|OMG! (oh my Gibson) this movie is fantastic.  I am very skeptical of any action movie that doesn't have at least one robot on robot fight in it, but The Passion of the CHRIST (Centurion Humanoid Robot Intelligence System version - T) was amazing.  Mel Gibson's attention to detail was apparent in every scene.  He even gave J-CHRIST his own archaic robo-language (thank Gibson for subtitles right!).  However, I am still a little perplexed why Gibson decided to set this film in Gladiator times, Crowe already nailed that role and this movie didn't have a single chariot race in it, so what's the point? I suppose I am just nitpicking, the rest of the film was thrilling and packed full of more action than a bang bus on spring break.<br /><br />The Passion of the CHRIST's plot was very post modern and provocative.  In most films, the down on his luck robot cop has to turn in his robo-badge and go home to his unloving abusive robo-wife, but eventually he overcomes the odds and starts smashing robot faces while Drowning Pool's \\"Let the Bodies Hit the Floor\\" plays in the background. (Note to Mr.Gibson: You need a better soundtrack for the sequel) In this film, however, J-CHRIST takes the pain and continues to higher ground where he can better broadcast his distress signal.  Right as you are expecting the big battle royal finale where J-CHRIST calls in his 12 Mega-Disciplebots to assemble into the Holy Voltrininty, the film takes a dramatic twist and leaves you floored like the gas pedal on a bang bus on spring break once you find out she is actually only fifteen.<br /><br />I love how foolish the Romans were, J-CHRIST was clearing leaking coolant and yet they forced him to carry around a huge heat sink and air cool by walking.  If they wanted to short-circuit his mainframe or possibly override his front-side bus they should have generated a large EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) or simply removed his Intel Cerebral Cortex (tm).  The part I was most confused about was the ending.  I understand that he did a Terminator time travel, the no clothes on and dramatic music bit, but why did he have holes in his Adamantium endoskeleton?  Everyone knows that the classic sign of a time traveling robot is a blast crater with electricity arching off it, not holes in your hands.  I guess it is just another element of Gibson's genius that I am incapable of fully grasping.<br /><br />This film deserves five stars.  The Passion of the CHRIST is a thrill ride within a thrill ride within a Hard Rock Caf&eacute; that will leave you gripping your seats in excitement, not for balance and leverage,  like inside a bang bus on spring break.at he did a Terminator time travel, the no clothes on and dramatic music bit, but why did he have holes in his Adamantium endoskeleton?

B000002UAU|5.0|[[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)]]  I had a social studies teacher in seventh grade who played this album over and over. He commented on the various aspects of the lyrics, music, the overall crafting of the album, in a way in which I came to appreciate the genius behind the album. It's been fun to listen after many decades and discover that it is as good today as I remember it.
B002HWUU2C|4.0|I've enjoyed this duo's music since I saw Once and this album continues the tradition.    However, as has been mentioned in prior comments, this \\"Limited Deluxe\\" Edition does not contain the same live CD as the \\"Deluxe\\" edition. It is short six songs and is from the same concert as the included DVD. However, the DVD makes this version worth getting as they are excellent to watch live (the Jr HS choir singing along to the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\" is something special).
B002UJIY7A|4.0|\\"I'm just difficult to kill, I guess...\\" - as soon as one of the main characters of A Perfect Getaway utters these words, you KNOW someone will try to prove him wrong. And they DO (try ;o) ). The story seems simple at first: a couple is honeymooning in Hawaii, while news spreads thru the Islands of a brutal murder of another newlywed couple. The suspected murderers, a man and a woman, are still at large and likely still in Hawaii. As our city-dwellers hike thru the Park, alone and out of their element, can they trust the strangers with whom they inevitably cross paths? (OF COURSE, NOT!) And that's when an interesting twist takes this story from predictable to... well... no spoilers here! ;o)<br /><br />I did not have high hopes for this flick...I went to see it mainly because I have a secret crush on Milla Jovovich (if I were a lesbian, Milla and Mariska Hargitay from Law and Order would be my dream dates ;-P...). Was the film perfect? No. Nonetheless, to my utmost surprise, I enjoyed this thriller far more then I did many supposed \\"blockbusters\\" this year. It had some laughs, but was also quite unnerving, tense, and creepy with a light sprinkling of gore: everything a good thriller should have on offer. There were signs from the audience that I was not alone in my enjoyment. However, the film did develop its creep factor slowly as the initial 45 minutes were devoted mainly to character development. The story needed time before it graduated from \\"fluff\\" to \\"nail biter\\". It worked for me. In the end, I felt the super plot twist more then made up for the wait!<br /><br />Two names are worth mentioning (in addition to Jovovich): it was the first time I saw Steve Zahn competently playing a complex \\"grown up\\" character, a role totally different from the usual \\"doofus\\" types he seems to favour. Also, Timothy Olyphant surprised me with his performance. His acting skills often leave a lot to desire. Not here. He was PERFECT as the perennially confident and \\"difficult to kill\\" owner of a metal plate in his head...<br /><br />PS: David Twohy, writer/director, also directed Pitch Black. Watch the chase scene at the end of A Perfect Getaway. It is identical in style to one of the chase scenes in Pitch Black...metal plate in his head...

B0000073I5|5.0|I've always been a huge Genesis fan and purchased this album when it first came out close to 30 yrs ago.  This melodic music is timeless.  It is one album I never get tired of listening to. Great night driving music!
B002H3F7F6|2.0|Like really..wtf.     Sting has been one of the strongest influences musically in my life. One of the most respected artists according to me. Whose works right from ..the blue turtles, to the soul cages and even stuff like Brand new day..has inspired me endlessly as to how this guy with his virtuosity of a crazy jazz musician, shoves commercial sounding pop-ish music onto regular listeners' playlists. He delivers insane musicanship with such a listenable smooth ease that the listener most of the times doesn't even realise.    But I have to say...that this man needs to come off of his songs-from-the-labyrinth trip. This celtic medival enya cross breeds with old irish folk kinda stuff that he's been high on lately. I know it sounds very rash of me to talk about a great musician like Sting in that manner. But I cannot help it. Its been years and years that I've been dying waiting for an impactful record like soul cages to come out, but year after year Mr Sumner disappoints ever since he came out with his Sacred love album.    This is not right...and I personally feel that he is losing out on his fans and will lose even more if he stays on this trip. At least I and some of my friends who are also die hard sting fans are fairly disappointed since the past few years. We're not giving up on you Mr. Sting...but we do feel the need to express that you need to get back into your groove...release something as mind blowing as \\"mad about you\\" or \\"children's crusade\\" or \\"fortress around your heart\\"...and win your fans back.    This vocal-prowess-demonstrating-celtic-folksy-dreary-melodies-with-a-lute kind of material is definitely going to make some of your ardent fans lose patience and run away for good. Trust me!    Are you listening!?!?
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I'm gonna review the quality of the blu-ray version of this movie. I'm not gonna review the movie itself as there are enough reviews of it. I was surprised with the quality of this movie, I wasn't expecting an spectacular image quality but it exceeded my expectations. Sure the quality is not like a new release film, but the quality is outstanding considering how old is this movie. My only gripe is that image quality is not consistent in some parts of the movie(those are few), but I think that's more related to the camera work in the movie than with the HD conversion. The audio is superb, and that's a good thing especially with this movie. Recommended buy for HDTV owners.
0307454541|5.0|Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is well written with a strong plot and engaging characters, especially Lisbeth. As I read through the novel, I was uplifted and interested in how Lisbeth grew out of herself and overcame huge personal challenges. The stories of the industrial tycoons and their families show how great power not only corrupts but can create severe mental illness. Characters were nuanced and I was pulling for them. Fortunately Larsson was a good enough writer to keep his far left economic views to a minimum.
0790729725|5.0|I really can't put into words how I feel about this film.  A Scorcese masterpiece (for which they robbed him of Oscar), it juxtaposes, (the same way the Sopranos did later on), the real life family struggles mobsters deal with.......with their \\"jobs\\".  Add to that the masterfully written dialogue, which incidentally has provided years and years of fodder for my family, and you have a film of monumental proportions---\\"Henry....you gotta go back to Karen.....you're not gonna get a divorce...we're not animale\\"....Genius! Genius!

Even the cover had to be dishonest and not mention itself as being edited or even the forward by Ray, just \\"150th anniversary edition.\\" This man is too scared of bad sales or press to even put his name on the cover.

B00004Y7SF|5.0|Of course Christina can SANG and admittedly, there maybe moments where she probably even \\"over sings\\" but...i LOVE IT! The songs that stand out the most are the ones that have to do with Christ cuz hey, it is HIS birthday that she's singing about (besides the secular songs on the albums which i dont particularly care for)...only the one's that are jealous of her gift would give this album less than 4 stars (she deserves at least 4 based on her vocal gift alone...)

B002P6TA94|4.0|I made sure I listened to this album twice through before I gave my review. I really do like this album. The songs don't jump out at you the way the first album did, but if you are a fan of Wolfmother's first album I think you will like this one as well. Andrew Stockdale is an extremly talented song writer and musician and his vocals sound so much like the late Ron Goddard of the early 70's glam band \\"Whitewitch\\" it's uncanny. I think the more I hear this album the more I will like it. Great songs, great musicians...it's nice to hear new heavy rock and roll.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|After seeing This Is It in the theatre, I had to order this DVD. I want to be able to watch it over and over and recall the magic that was Michael Jackson. He was a part of my life's soundtrack since 1969 and I will not soon forget it. We have lost a wonderful humanitarian, and, an incredible songwriter and person who wanted to spread love to the world. What an incredible loss to us all.   Outstanding movie.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|My brother-in-law had heard good things about this movie from a friend. He and I both like scary movies, so we went and saw it at the theater.  First of all, it's not scary AT ALL.  Second, it's stupid. It's so stupid that many people in the theater were laughing at it.  Uh sure, if you want a movie with a \\"twist ending\\"; this has one. Only you have to  endure the whole movie just to see the twist, which isn't that interesting.  My b-i-l said he was going to give his friend a really hard time for recommending this movie.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|For me it feels like there is a fundamental difference between the new CD and the older ones.<br /><br />First, with the old \\"original\\" CD's  its like the songs were written for Whitney.<br />With the newer CD's - especially this one - It fees like the songs were already there and a singer was needed to finalize the product.<br /><br />So the melodies, instruments and effects are completely different than f.e from the first CD's.<br />So its no surprise that most song patterns sound familiar somehow.<br /><br />Having said that there are a couple of nice songs on it.<br />Below are the ones that I like most.<br /><br />* I look to you<br />* Worth it<br />* I got you<br />* Salute<br /><br />Second, Whitney's voice is at times so much different that it makes you wonder if its really the same person.<br />It feels a bit like a Porsche that runs at 40 miles/h. I makes you wonder what happened to the engine.<br /><br />Third, After such a long break a textbooklet with background and lyrics would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Overall an o.k-ish album, but originally I did expect much more from Whitney.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Nobody in this book does anything that remotely resembles how people really behave.  For example, hours after the CIA learns that a powerful man has been kidnapped, they haven't contacted his closest family member or traced his cellphone, which the kidnapper is sending text messages from.  That sort of sloppiness lends itself to keeping the plot moving, but requires you leave your brain at the door.<br /><br />And you'd think the author got paid by the adverb. Every action is punctuated by a \\"breathlessly\\", \\"angrily\\", \\"eerily\\" or the like.  It's like he's afraid that we WON'T. GET. HOW. IMPORTANT. THIS. IS.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book serves as an interesting trivia guide as each major plot point is a chance for the main character, Robert Langdon, to remember a lecture he's given related to that plot point--the history of the freemasons, the creation of the U.S. capitol building, famous masons through history, etc.  Other characters get their moments to muse on their area of expertise--the library of congress, noetics, computer hacking.  Then there are the points where they lecture each other as Langdon deciphers puzzles. Unfortunately, these lectures come across more as essays on a topic that stopped the silly plot dead in its tracks repeatedly.<br /><br />I put it down more than once, and eventually skimmed the back half, stopping at the subjects that interested me.  In the end, though, I found myself wondering whether even that was worth the time spent.<br /><br />Let the lone star above serve as my answer (he exclaimed breathlessly)
B000068IEU|2.0|I have already watched the new 2009 version and really liked it. This original version is boring, i actually fell asleep 4 times. I had to stop it and come back to watch the rest the next day. This is supposed to be a horror/thriller movie, but then the benny hill type circus soundtrack is horrible. Some of the scenes are even humorous, like the police officers trying to hitchhike after they ran out of gas. The new modern version is much better. Oh ... and what's with their daughter refusing to wear a bra and showing her breasts in front of her father ... ? That was creepy.
0691142165|5.0|When one reads the book, the first impression is the incredible amount of work the authors put into collecting the most comprehensive, as of today, dataset on financial crises and key economic variables for not only developed but also developing countries. This dataset will most definitely be at the heart of future empirical work on financial crises.     It will discipline economists to strive to build more realistic models that are able to reproduce the systematic trends and fluctuations of economic variables around the period of financial crises. As the authors admit to be surprised themselves, not only such systematic relationships abound across time but also across developed and developing countries.     The book is an important reminder that it is easy to live under the illusion that \\"this time is different\\" and that developed countries have outgrown severe financial crises. However, as the current financial crisis reminded us the more we lie to ourselves, the less vigilant we are as to potential worst case scenarios.    Finally, speaking of vigilance, the book is not only a thorough description of the past but also hints at a very serious problem many countries including the US would most likely face in the future; namely, the issuance of unsustainable levels of government debt which could have tremendous negative medium and long run effects at a global level.

B002UD56I6|5.0|I saw This Is It at 12:01 am on October 28th in IMAX.  It was enthralling from beginning to end - Michael's presence on stage and screen is so strong that you can't take your eyes off of him.  The movie is a great representation of what the concerts would have been like...and they would have blown everybody away.  You can't help singing and moving along to all the numbers, and the visuals are beautiful.  The other important part of the film is the candid look at Michael himself as he interacts with others, such as his fans have rarely seen.  He's dedicated, focused; an integral part of the process.  He's playful and fearless, and wants to get everything just right.  This Is It is a must-see/must-have for any fan...and anyone who wants to be inspired.    The only downside was what seemed to be an \\"out of focus\\" camera.  At the beginning of the film, there are several shots that appear \\"blurry\\" when compared to the rest.  This may be more noticable in IMAX than regular theaters because of the screen and other detail (or it might be due to some problem at the theater I was at).  It disappears after a little while.  This may be apparent in the Blu-ray or possibly even the DVD if it was part of the film and not because of an error.
0786915749|3.0|This is something that I should have read back in the day when I first got into the whole D&D thing and Fantasy in general - Now, having gone through hundreds of fantasy genre novels, this falls so very flat -<br /><br />This is a standard role-playing game converted into novel format - there is no actual character development, and the plot is your basic this is the quest - go to this place - get this item - go to this place - tedium.<br /><br />The worst portion of this, is after the main battle, the epilogue is HUGE - every single remaining character has their ending to this book, though we know there are more novels, and then, they have to have the 'intrigue' that will entice you to go onto the Dragons of Winter Something or other -<br /><br />If you are new to Fantasy, by all means, read these, because they are not horrible for fun, but worthless for development beyond the characters that they rolled - The authors even admit that a majority of the story comes from their gaming - which, to me, is a lazy way to develop you story-line - but it is whatever I guess - 3 stars<br /><br />*Note* - I now hate the words Grimaced (used multiple times) Twilight (seriously, title dropping?) and Mustaches (continually stroking his mustaches)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing video/dvd workouts for 20 years and have probably 50 different workouts or more. I would consider myself intermediate/advanced in level. I wanted to step up my workout routine last year because I had gained a few pounds over the winter.  I started using this DVD and found it was an excellent and challenging workout in a short amount of time. And-I lost those few pounds! I also have two of her other DVDs-all are great!
B002BIULQ2|4.0|Bought this for my 13 year old.  I told her I would take her to the movies when it was out but with conflicts, was never able to do so.  Decided to surprise her with the DVD when it was released and she really loved it.  Even I found myself laughing but I am forced (ok, sometimes not forced) to watch all those i Carly, Tru Jackson and Hannah shows.
B0013FSXT6|2.0|buy this on dvd. The blue ray is no better than dvd. This is the worst blue ray I own. Picture quality is poor. I have a new sony blue ray player and a samsung LED t.v. so the flaws really show.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I did not start watching until the end of season 2, and was very excited when season 1 was released on DVD.  Once I started watching season 1, I ended up watching the entire season in just 3 sittings.  I found myself laughing so hard, I had to stop and catch my breath on numerous occasions.  I have some science nerds in my own life, so I'm sure that helped the humor hit home so much.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />\\"A Ridley Scott Film\\" ... what more is to be said. Scott has to be ranked up in the top 10 Director's in the last 50 years! Brillant film, excellent masterpiece, riveting performance's by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou: (who's making a name for himself in cinema) and applause for the rest of the outstanding cast put together including Richard Harris. This film is an attribute of pure genious, as far as, production, direction, and cinematography. In my own words 'Bravo' ... there's not enough superlatives or accolades that has not been already attributed to this movie. This film is liken the movies of epic perportions of the late 1950's into the early 60's, with it's magnificent cast and colossal action. Especially on the Blu-ray Disc 'Sapphire Series' and it's extended version, as an option. The Blu-ray transfer is the best I have seen to this date with it's rich and vivid color, sound, aspect-ratio. It's as if you were sitting in a theater and much more. It's definetely a keeper for your library with the additional bonus disc loaded with special features. I personally have three copies of this movie, the first release on DVD, the 'Signature Selection' two dvd set and the Blu-ray Disc \\"Sapphire Series\\".
0545123267|5.0|I bought Shiver on a whim. I had read several of the reviews, and it sounded pretty good so I picked it up. I finished it in about a day, I had such a hard time putting it down. I absolutely loved this book. It was sad seeing the book come to an end, but I'm glad to see there will be a book two.<br /><br />Shiver was a non-stop ride and emotional driven. I really enjoyed the characters, the were very easy to relate to. To see Grace and Sam's love flourish was exciting and heart wrenching. Maggie Stiefvater has written a beautiful story, it's descriptive and very real. I think it's gonna appeal to alot of readers, but especially if your a fan of Young Adult Fantasy.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Needless to say that this is a 5 star set all the way,but why the high list price? First,it was near impossible to find when it was released last september (ok,EMI underestimated demand,that can happen),but the stereo box set with more discs is cheaper,and those discs are available everywhere.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Shame on those who gave this a bad review.  I saw the movie, and I just loved it. I ordered two copies of this dvd, and I'm looking forward to seeing again and again. It's sad that Michael never got the chance to have his comeback, and to have his children see him perform on stage.  I grew up with MJ, he's the same age as me. I've always enjoyed watching and listening to him.  Unfortunately, I never got the pleasure to see him live.  But watching all these dvd's makes me feel, I've been part of the audience. Lauren.
0802714544|5.0|[[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]]  This is a jewel in the crown of espionage novels. I fell in love with this book upon its first reading, and have read it many times.  No glory here.  No other book captures the cold, hard feel of Post War Berlin and the intrigue and duplicity that accommodates the craft. This novel is beautiful in its dreariness, evocative of the desolation and the consciousness of the doomed.  After reading this book, you can never pass by the Brandenburg Gate and not think of this novel.

B002HJ5WX2|5.0|When I saw that Alice In Chains started working on a new album is was skeptic at best, but, hearing the 2 released songs (\\"Check My Brain\\" and \\"A Looking in View\\") I started to get excited. When I finally saw them a month before the album was released (Amsterdam, Melkweg 12/8/09) I was already a convert.  I won't go into song by song review, but I can say a few things about the album in general and my favorites: The album sounds like another Alice In Chains album, and I mean it in the best possible way. What seemed more than impossible in 2002, is a living, kicking and moving reality. It has it's groove with a set of strongly emotional songs, each with its own color and presentation. Several songs are very powerfully brought, with the strong grinding riffs this band is well known for, while several others, not less emotional are minimally delivered in a tight but more quiet package.    Personal favorites are \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" because it's hauntingly blue and beautiful, \\"Check My Brain\\" because it's ultra catchy and so fun and \\"Lesson Learned\\" because that song sound like it IS (present tense) Alice in Chains in full glory, and I can even swear I hear Layne there (yeah, you can say I'm hearing things now...).    Overall, strong album, well performed and delivered by a band almost all of us though extinct not long ago. A must buy!
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I set my mind to reviewing David Lynch's film 'Dune.' I sat diligently, adopting my usual scrupulous technique: watch twice, jot down points, events, slivers of music, shudders, inane trivia etc - then write it all up on the WP to be sliced down to a palatable size later...<br />Blankness.<br /><br />So, basics: Did I enjoy it? -- yes, very much. Did it have breathtaking set design and production values which left the inferior 'Bladerunner' in its dust.. comprehensively. Was I horrified and delighted in equal measure by the antics of the prime villain - Baron Harkonnen ? -- indeed I was. Was the music suggestive and grandiose..? The Sand-Worms completely awesome....? Sting bad...?<br />Yes, and more...<br /><br />Lynch is a curious film director. His films are not like anybody else's. People go on about them - say things like: \\"Lynch doesn't normally do sci-fi, but you could argue that ALL his films are sci-fi...\\" Heavy stuff like that.<br />Some admit that they do/don't/can't/won't understand them - others imagine. Some can't see the point in bothering...<br /><br />All his films are comedies - Kyle MacLachlan's 'Dune' voiceover for example, is as pointed a clue without being blatant - and is otherwise inexplicable.<br />Much like 'La Cabina,' funny/weird people start the day with just a suggestion of funny/weird, escalating into hardcore funny/weird by the final quarter.<br />As someone who doesn't understand film at all, I have to wonder how Lynch gets finance. Imagine taking 'Lost Highway' to a bunch of execs and hoping for some millions to make it happen... yet happen it did. Does anybody think studio money-men are sympathetic to an 'artist' ?  Lynch is bankable you say...?<br /><br />Lynch's 'Dune' is a surgical burrowing through the bowels of an enormous omnibus of a novel. The plot is helpfully zilch: a spice controls the universe; everyone wants it; shenanigans ensue when they all try to get it; big battle.<br />Cue 'Prophecy' theme.<br />Why everybody makes SUCH a fuss is beyond me: \\"Fans and critics alike, are divided in equal measure...\\" What? Why.....!?<br /><br />Then again, why would anyone even contemplate reviewing 'Dune' ? It's a movie, it runs about 2 ¼ hours and is big and quite exciting.<br />It's a David Lynch film, and that means you can spout the most abstract, pompous, selfish, insanely reversed clap-trap about it - and people will still take you seriously.<br />(And despite the proximity of incendiary words like 'spice,' 'girl' and 'power,' I've resisted all temptation to mention Mel B's extraordinary breasts - so delightfully omnipresent in all sections of modern media. Aren't I the good boy...?)ke, are divided in equal measure...\\" What? Why.....!?     Then again, why would anyone even contemplate reviewing 'Dune' ?

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Even though I have read a lot of reviews on the Ear Force X41 that were positive, the negative ones had me worried. Was I going to get a ton of static? Is it better than my current surround sound setup?    All my questions were answered when I received my X41's. First of all, I notice no static or hiss that some people have experienced. Even when in the dashboard of Xbox 360 all I notice is the sound of the menu effects. Next up was the comparison to my current surround sound setup. The X41's really shine in this department. I have a fantastic surround sound system consisting of Definitive Technologies speakers and a Denon receiver and it performs great, but in order to hear the level of detail that I get in my X41's, I have to crank my system so loud that my neighbors can hear it. The X41's also create a better sound stage for whatever game I am playing. The best way to describe it would be you're in your own little bubble and can hear everything happening all around you. Even the ambient music in the COD 4 menu sounded like it was coming from about 8 feet in front of me near my TV.    Pros:  Great detail and clarity. You will notice sounds in game that you never noticed before.    Allows a complete sound experience even at off hours when you don't want to disturb anyone.    Offers a pretty big advantage when playing games where sound cues are everything. You will know where someone is if they reload a gun or switch to their pistol. You can hear someone sneaking up behind you trying to knife. No more wondering where the Witch is, you can easily pinpoint her location with these bad boys.    Wireless with a very easy setup. The sound quality rivals wired headsets that do the same thing.    Cons:  Echo happens every now and then when chatting through Xbox Live. If I pull out the mic cable and plug it back in it goes away, but having to do that every time may get annoying the longer I own them.    Stepping away to go to the kitchen or bathroom with these on does createa lot of static and crackling. So I would suggest leaving them near the base when you have to step away from the game.    All in all this is an excellent product that I highly recommend. The pros far outweigh the cons here.
0385504225|3.0|Notwithstanding the repetitive text and the unnecessary length, this book is still entertaining as it lays out the twists and turns. However, it is written as though it's a screenplay in preparation. The writing is not up to par for a reading audience. Plot-wise it keeps the reader thinking, but Langdon himself appears less intelligent and incapable than in previous books. He is on the receiving end not only in the physical torture meted out but also in the information section - he is constantly being lectured to, particularly in the last third of the book. Overall, a satisfactory follow-up to Da Vinci code but you could just skip it and wait for the movie.
0385504225|3.0|I have enjoyed the books in Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code series, but am unlikely to buy a 4th if one comes along.  Brown's pacing is good, and the book is a fun read, but I never really bought in to the underlying premises.  The story and situations seemed contrived, and the mythology seemed forced.  In the end, I found myself thinking, \\"Really?  That's it?\\".    Worth reading, but pick it up at the Library and read it for free.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|This is definitely a more polished entry from this compelling duo.  I did not realize they had ended their romantic relationship, and I'm sad about that, but it imparts a bitterwseet air to their performance.  Hopefully they will continue their musical association for years to come, because they are only getting better.  This CD showcases Irglova's lovely voice in a couple of numbers.  I feel like Hansard is such a huge personality, and I like the idea that he has a softer side and uses Irglova to send that message.  I agree with the reviewer who points out that Hansard's voice is not so raw as on earlier albums.  In general the orchestration is more prominent and beautifully offsets their vocals.  The lyrics are clever and rueful.  I like this CD quite a bit.  I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 because it feels like something I could put in my player at any time, and never get tired of it.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield takes on a familiar movie subject, a monster appears out of nowhere and attacks New York City, destroying landmarks, crushing cars and eating people. The military is called in to deal with the beast. What makes Cloverfield unique is the way it is filmed and the fact that it doesn't attempt to explain what the monster is or where it came from.    The entire movie is the recording of a personal video camera that was being used at a party to record the going away messages for the guest of honor. Because the guy manning the camera is a doofus we also get to eavesdrop on conversations that weren't meant for the tape, but help set up character development. When the attack begins everyone runs outside naturally to see what's going on and the doofus never puts down the camera believing that the event should be recorded for history.    The rest of the movie we tag along with a group of friends as they try to rescue an injured friend from her destroyed apartment building and then find a way out of the city while the military attempts to destroy the monster.    I enjoyed Cloverfield. I thought the story was told in a clever way and the characters were believable. The special effects were good as well. Overall an interesting take on the monster movie genre.
B000W796OM|5.0|There are two reasons that HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the best of all the films in the series. First and foremost, the movie was headed by one of the finest directors working in the world today, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, directed of one of the greatest films of the 21st century, THE CHILDREN OF MEN, as well as the celebrated Mexican film Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N. The first two films frequently suffer from pacing and rhythm problems. Things just frequently feel \\"off.\\" Too many scenes don't work or are too abbreviated. But the worst thing about the first two movies is that they focus on the most lamentable parts of the relevant books and then drag them out. Cuar&oacute;n is, unlike Chris Columbus, a genius. Second, THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the last book in the series that can be moderately summed up in a film. THE GOBLET OF FIRE was the first of the Harry Potter books that could be considered a very long book. So THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN contained most of the highlights of the novel without seriously abbreviating the story.  But I don't want to exaggerate things.  THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN works as a movie less because it summarizes the events of the book than because it gets at the heart of the story and repackages it into a new medium.  Ultimately THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN works not because it is a good adaptation of a movie, but because it is a great movie on its own merits.<br /><br />That really does sum up why this is the best of the Harry Potter movies:  it is the only one of the films that stands on its own.  All of the other of the movies play as if the director/writer has an eye on the movie from which they are derived.  Too their credit, subsequent movies try to follow in the path of AZKABAN and several of them are entertaining.  But what is lacking is the great script of this film and the impeccable talent of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about the series of films as a whole is the extraordinary array of acting talent.  The main three improved tremendously after the first two movies and they were constantly surrounded by an amazing group of actors.  In this film such excellent actors as Robert Hardy, Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, Julie Christie, and David Thewlis join the cast.  It is amazing that actors of this quality join and already impressive group of performers.  Sadly, another great actor, Michael Gambon, joined the cast under sad circumstances.  After the death of Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the first two movies, Gambon took over as head of Hogwarts.  I loved Harris and I regretted his loss, but Gambon stepped into the role and didn't miss a beat.<br /><br />While I've loved the subsequent Harry Potter movies, none of them have come up to the level of this one.  In fact, in an objective list of the great fantasy movies ever made, this is the one entry from the series that could make such a list.  By any standard, this is a great movie.  Sadly Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n declined offers to direct subsequent films in the series.  Well, kinda sadly.  How can you regret that the movie he made instead of THE GOBLET OF FIRE was THE CHILDREN OF MEN, which is quite possibly the greatest dystopian movie ever made?  As I said, that movie would feature in any discussion of the very greatest movies made in the last decade.  Still, while I love that movie dearly (if you haven't seen it, you should make a point of doing so immediately), I'm sorry that he couldn't have continued with the Harry Potter series.  Heck, I wish he could have made all of them.  Frankly, I am shocked that they were able to get an actor of his stature involved with this series to begin with.  Even though he did not continue with the series, he at least elevated the tone from the first two films.  Thanks to him the rest of the series aspired to be more, even if later directors did not always succeed.emendously after the first two movies and they were constantly surrounded by an amazing group of actors.

0786868724|5.0|No matter what your faith, this is a great, inspirational and fun book to read.  The story covers big topics, but Mitch Albom's rabbi is so easy-going and funny that it's very enjoyable to read even while it's making you think a little.  The inner-city pastor Albom meets isn't quite as easy-going or humorous, but his story is no less inspirational.  You will remember these two men long after you've finished the book.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Talk about some imagination.  Where, oh where, do the caretakers of the Alien franchise set up the third installment?  To come up with an isolated, desolate planet harboring what was once a maximum security prison--a place where its inhabitants have virtually no defenses against a snarling monster--is sheer genius.  And that's exactly where we find ourselves as ALIEN3 unfolds its disturbing, claustrophobic story:  a spaceship crash, with Ripley--and of course, one of the facehuggers--as the lone survivor, on a planet with some very bad men who've done very bad things. . .and there's no place to escape.<br /><br />Count me in.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver really ups the tragic pathos of her beloved Ripley character; this is one depressed lady with some serious angst--and she's trying her best to convince her new associates that something very, very bad is about to happen to all of them.  In fact, something very, very bad is about to happen to Ripley herself, and it's this realization that adds an extra thread of tension as ALIEN3 rolls darkly to its climax.  (I must confess, the alien's demise was too over-the-top, but didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.)<br /><br />Once again, Weaver is joined by a strong supporting cast, including Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, and Danny Webb, to name but a few.  Lance Henriksen returns, briefly, as a severely damaged Bishop, then as greedy entrepreneur Bishop II.  Director David Fincher, following Ridley Scott and James Cameron, definitely had his work cut out for him, and for the most part delivers a grand seat squirmer, yet in comparison ALIEN3 falls a little short of its fantastic predecessors.  Having said that, and based on the horrific turkey that was to follow, the Alien series should have said adios here.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

0061914177|4.0|There are two reasons to buy Crush It!: one is that you're dissatisfied with the direction of your career and are looking for ways to make some changes, and the other is you're looking for a prototype for writing a successful nonfiction book.     Whether you're an employee who wants to become an entrepreneur, or a entrepreneur who wants to become known as an expert in your field, you'll want to study Crush It!    I'm an underliner, happiest when I'm holding a pen and underlining key phrases and sentences while reading. Reading Crush It! on a couple of recent train trips to and from Boston, I was surprised at the number of pages containing ideas I underlined. Gary has a way of succinctly making his points, i.e., \\"Even the dullest introvert has pizzazz when talking about something he is passionate about, and when he's using the right medium to talk about it.\\"    Another example of Gary's writing style: \\"To everyone who is freaking out because they fear the noise and distraction of all the additional content on the Internet, you can relax. Quality is a tremendous filter. Cream also rises, my friends, no matter how many cups of coffee you pour.\\"    So, in Crush It!, we have an excellent example of a roadmap to creating a brand (instead of a resume) and a prototype of hitting the best-seller lists with a well-written, helpful, relevant, and timely book. A great deal for under $20!    It will be fun to watch how Gary follows-up with the success of this book, as well as observe the successes of his readers applying his lessons.    Roger
0785123490|5.0|Probably one of the best Marvel mini-series ever in my opinion.  Thanos makes an excellent antagonist and this series gives his character a lot of depth.  For all intents and purposes HE is the star of this piece and plays his part well.  It's hard to go into much detail without giving away the more essential plot twists but if you like villains that threaten on a scale equal to or above that of Gods and Goddesses, massive battles featured pretty much every Marvel big name and pretty much 99% of their heaviest hitters going head to head with that sort of threat, then this is the series for you.  My only pet peeve with this particular collection of issues is I felt that it should have included the 2 issues of the 'Thanos Quest' storyline that details how Thanos obtained the Infinity Gems.  This particular collection is assuming you read that or otherwise don't need to know and it feels a bit like walking in on a movie 20 minutes after it's started- you get the majority of the story but the beginning and setup is missing and I think the inclusion of that content would have gone a long way to illustrate just why Thanos having the Infinity Gauntlet is so much of a problem.      Regardless, this is one of Marvel's best series ever and while it may not have quite the heart-wrenching moments of something like The Dark Phoenix Saga, it has what should be many jaw dropping moments.  I just wish this story was told in this day and age when coloring has made leaps and bounds and the art could have more pop than the somewhat flat coloring in this version does.  But it was the pinnacle of mid-90's production.    A must have if you like Thanos as character, Adam Warlock, or the idea of watching the biggest names in Marvel-dom fight probably the biggest threat it has seen to date.

B002436WFI|5.0|As an avid Terry Pratchett fan I was afraid this would be disappointing.  Instead, I was riveted to the screen from the start.  The books are complex, witty, clever and satirical, which is a huge challenge for cinema.  The omissions in this movie version are minimal with regard to the plot.  The casting, special effects, scene construction as well as musical scoring more than make up for some simplification.  Surely there will be more Pratchett movies done in similar fashion.  The large number of Discworld books would make this venue a goldmine.  I am ready to preorder asap. Bring 'em on!!!
B002P7UCMC|5.0|There was a lot of hype built up for Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da. Band members and representatives have for a while said this album is as hard as Rammstein's early albums (Sensucht), with all of the experimentation of the band's more varied albums (Mutter), while at the same time incorporating all of the maturity of the later albums (Rosenrot). That's a very tall order, but this album really delivers. Note however, this album is actually pretty experimental. No single song sums up the album, so don't judge it based on one single. And with all the complexity, I'd also caution you to give the album at least a second listen-through before passing judgement. This is a very full plate- don't feel bad taking seconds.<br /><br />The album opens up with \\"Rammlied\\". Many reviewers have been accurate in saying this is something like the older track \\"Rammstein\\" remade with the band's full maturity, without losing any of its edge. Of particular note for long-time listeners is Christoph Schneider's drumming. He's been mic'ed up to 11, and he's even sneaking some double-bass throughout the album. Overall, a great opening. \\"Ich Tu Dir Weh\\" begins the experimentation in earnest- there's actually a lot of clean singing where Till drops the growl during the power portion of a song, and I can't help but feel some influence from the nu-metal genre. It adds up to an odd but very effective mix that I really enjoy even though I hate nu-metal.<br /><br />\\"Waidmanns Heil\\" (Hunter's Call) has the band having a lot of fun with a theme- Till even gets down into panting like an animal. \\"Haifisch\\" follows up on the side of fun, sounding something like the icebreaker that was the theme of \\"Reise, Reise\\" is crashing through a bordello. B&uuml;ckstab&uuml; (B********) has till grinding out the lyrics until they're virtually puke metal in parts, making a play on language- B&uuml;ckstab&uuml; is an imaginary word the band intentionally blanked out on the cover so people read more into it than is there, just the sort of language play the band is famous for. These tracks are all solid, and all rocking in their very different ways.<br /><br />And then, \\"Fr&uuml;hling in Paris\\". Wait, hold on, a song about a city that's not deeply satirical? \\"Fr&uuml;hling...\\" sounds hopeful and crisp. It's positively refreshing. You want to roll down the windows and enjoy the summer sun with this one. The band must be setting us up for something- and that something is \\"Weiner Blut\\". The icebreaker has turned up the hill and is mowing down a gothic castle, apparently. \\"Fr&uuml;hling...\\" and \\"Weiner Blut\\" form a duo that show the range of the album, from beautiful and hopeful and light to dark and foreboding and heavy.<br /><br />\\"P****\\". Yes, the word is pussy (the cat, I swear... fingers crossed). I'm not sure how so many negative reviews take this track so seriously- the band hits a dance beat partway through that sounds straight from Ibiza. They're clearly just having a lot of fun again, complete with some of the worst sexual metaphors you've ever heard (stick bratwurst in the sauerkraut). If you're really taking this track seriously and being offended that the band is singing such silly lyrics, you've missed the bulk of Rammstein's career and probably just aren't used to hearing the translation so directly. \\"Liebe Ist f&uuml;r Alle Da\\" is a fast and yes again fun track, with a lot of clean singing and catchy guitars. \\"Mehr\\" ranges from some heavy electronic sound in the keyboarding to hard as an anvil metal guitar to melodic singing- it's all over, yet it all comes together like a hammer coming down.<br /><br />\\"Roter Sand\\" is an incredibly interesting change of pace. Acoustic guitars and whistling, in my metal band? This song is incredibly emotional and evocative, surpassing even \\"Ein Leid\\" in terms of frankness. It sounds like the theme for the best western ever filmed, and frankly I was nearly moved to tears at one point from the beauty of this track. It's that good.<br /><br/>I'd seriously encourage everyone to get the Special Edition digipack. Not only is the digipack great quality, but it's not much extra money ($1 as of writing!), and you get great bonus tracks. \\"Fuhre Mich\\" contains more experimenting between heavy as hell guitars and very clean, simple singing for the chorus. \\"Donaukinder\\" sounds like oldschool Rammstein, with simple but wailing guitar backed by massive keyboarding. \\"Halt\\" has the band on overdrive, with Till screaming over raucous guitar. \\"Roter Sand [Orchester Version]\\", and \\"Liese\\" are both takes on \\"Roter Sand\\", and sound like they're mixes of the song rejected in editing. It's very interesting to get some insight into the band's process. The final pieces, especially the orchester version, sound very complete and solid even if I still think the final version is the best.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album where I love every single track (the \\"Roter Sand\\" edits don't count). My favorite tracks so far are \\"Roter Sand\\", \\"Fr&uuml;hling in Paris\\", \\"Ich Tu Dir Weh\\", and \\"Pussy\\" (like a cat, remember?). Not that the harder tracks aren't excellent, but it's great to hear a band this established really playing around with their sound and trying new things. I happily hold this up to any of Rammstein's other releases, and track-for-track, I have to say this is a strong contender for the band's best album to date.the digipack great quality, but it's not much extra money ($1 as of writing!), and you get great bonus tracks. \\"Fuhre Mich\\" contains more experimenting between heavy as hell guitars and very clean, simple singing for the chorus. \\"Donaukinder\\" sounds like oldschool Rammstein, with simple but wailing guitar backed by massive keyboarding. \\"Halt\\" has the band on overdrive, with Till screaming over raucous guitar. \\"Roter Sand [Orchester Version]\\", and \\"Liese\\" are both takes on \\"Roter Sand\\", and sound like they're mixes of the song rejected in editing.

B00003CXC6|5.0|Check out more foreign movies on [...].<br /><br />Few classics in the cinematic world achieve such rare levels of cult status. This movie has not just inspired many movies, series and plays but also finds mention in literature. The beauty of the movie comes from the way how everybody's truth and lies differ. The truth is never found eventually because the truth is all dependent on the individuals and all of them are convicts in some way or the other. The guilt in each individual as well as the attempt to save themselves determines the stories. The movie actually throws up a very important question that if the essential data is kept intact the interpretation is completely dependent on the stakeholders. A masterpiece that has been around for over 50 years and even today anyone watching world movies will find it extremely enjoyable. Must watch
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol is another masterfully written novel by Dan Brown.  Not only does it contain all of the suspense, factual reference, and conspiracy theory that one would expect from Dan Brown, but this time he throws in some unusual twists that will prevent you from ever putting it down.    If I had to really nitpick and point out negatives, I would probably say that the story contains a few (a very few) predictable outcomes; Brown's writing contains the usual editorial errors; and the ending isn't exactly mind blowing by any means.  All in all, however, there are many more positives than negatives, and any reader who enjoys an involved story and an elaborate plot will enjoy reading this book.
0071636080|5.0|As a teacher of Presentation Skills in the HS classroom, I'd have loved to have read this book 6 months ago and then required it as one of the textbooks for the class. Absolutely outstanding and brings the levels of presentation delivery into award winning performance levels. With \\"Presentations\\" being considered the de facto method used in the business sector, absorption of this material is essential for an individuals success. BRAVO!!!
B00000DQSS|5.0|\\"Never For Ever\\" was released on September 11, 1980, reaching #1 on the UK album chart(the first for a solo female artist in the UK). It followed her \\"Tour of Life\\" in Europe to promote her previous albums \\"The Kick Inside\\" and \\"Lionheart\\". It would prove to be her only tour for various suggested reasons, a few being a fear of flying and the death of her stage lighting director Bill Duffield, who fell through a trapdoor while finishing up after a show.    Musically, the album is where her experimentation begins with the Fairlight CMI, which is a type of sampling synthesizer/drum machine. Though it is not used heavily, this equipment gives certain songs a deeper atmosphere. The dark and gothic \\"Never For Ever\\" contains tales of deception, death, longing, and a love of Egypt and violins. This provides quite a mystical trip, but the subject matter keeps in touch with reality.    \\"Never For Ever\\" is another Kate Bush masterpiece that, in hindsight, bridges \\"Lionheart\\" and her next album \\"The Dreaming\\", containing elements from both. In the end, it's one of her most complete works to date.    5 Stars!
0061122416|3.0|In The Alchemist, the young protagonist Santiago's main conflict is within himself, as he journeys both spiritually and physically in search of his life's treasure--his personal legend. Along the way, a series of conflicts, setbacks and truths are revealed to him in the form of wise men, omens, and incidents. Coelho tells his story with simplicity, but there is a moral to the story: follow your dream.     While I enjoyed some aspects of the metaphysical, spiritual approach of The Alchemist, there were some problems with its delivery, and these seemed to ruin what might have been a better book. Written as a fable, it borders on overly simplistic lessons for the young boy. The metaphors were plenty, but became cumbersome because of their overexposure. The repetitive nature of the \\"nuggets of wisdom\\" came to be more annoying than compelling.  The message implicitly expressed by the author is \\"buy what I'm selling.\\"  The adage \\"less is more\\" could apply to the repetitive philosophies presented; there are too many, and had there been less, it might have made for a more profound epiphanies for Santiago (or the reader). Another problem was the secondary characters, who came across as prototypes. Most disappointing was the novel's conclusion, which felt like a proverbial rug being pulled from under me. To go along all this way hoping for some profound meaning and to have it end abruptly with a silly cliché seemed to render the story a sham, a hoax, a publicity stunt. In the end, the \\"life lessons\\" that Santiago acquires seem a bit superficial and forced, and this diminishes the story's depth.     I'm sure the book will still get 4 and 5 star reviews and people will follow this book and praise it, but I didn't find it particularly uplifting or inspiring.
B000A5044C|4.0|This Japanese film about a family of young children trying to make it on their own in life after their mother's selfish lifestyle leaves them to fend for them selves, is heart wrenching.  The child actors are amazing and the film really holds you in your seat.  Not a fan of the ending, but as a whole this film was a believable portrayal of doing what you can when being dealt a bad hand.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Indie Rock has turned soft.  Groups like Grizzly Bear, Fleet Foxes, Death Cab, Jenny Lewis and her crew, Davendra etc are talented musicians but they don't rock (at least not in my opinion)    When I listen to Surfer Rosa I hear the sounds of an uprising againt the commercial (hair metal, new wave) garbage that passed in the mid to late 80's as rock and I fondly remember bands like Husker Du, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. that were the vanguard of the indie movement at the time.    Surfer Rosa is a classic.  It has been a part of my weekly rotation for over 20 years now and it still sounds as exciting as theh first time I played it.    It has two of the Pixies most famous (rightly so) songs in  Gigantic and Where is my Mind and also features two of their more underrated gems in River Euphrates and Cactus.    This album effectively bridged the gap between the abrasive aggressiveness of punk and the unique do it yourself wierdness of the indie scene.    A very important record and a very entertaining one.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see this and I was in awstruck, speechless infact, in what a extra phenomenal performer he was. He brought a new style of entertaining at a whole new level. It was Amazing especially \\"smooth criminal\\" how he integrated an old movie into this song, brilliant! Just the 3D effects alone are mind blowing, \\"Thriller\\" for instance, that would have been great to watch in all of its entirety,along with the powerful \\"Earth Song\\" and so much more. Michael out did himself in this movie and you can see that in every song, new dance moves. He had a uniqueness and creativeness beyond, and you see it in this movie.And not to mention he sounded GREAT,The king of pop still had it. His true geniuness with his crew, and dancers everything was with LOVE, and inspiration. I loved how Michael said this is your turn to shine, and I will be right here with you to his crew. Michael Jackson transcended LOVE and,His passion for inspiring us to better ourselves and to help save the planet is the message that you walk away with in this film. Michael Jackson was a kind soul, plain and simple.I am so glad that I was able to go and see Michael Jackson last performance,a few of us in the movie theater sang to his songs, you could feel his presence right through the film. It was so warm to embrace all of those who love Michael Jackson and miss him.I cried just alittle bit, but all in all I walked away happy, being able to watch him one last time. There was even the young embracing Michael-I hope he is smiling about this. Now we can with this DVD watch him over and over again, how cool is that.This is must see film you can watch the magic from a man who changed the world on so many levels, who is a genius in the music industry, and a legend for all of his humatarian charities, who deserves to be called THE KING OF POP-MIchael Joseph Jackson- Thank you for all that you have done for us, and leaving your beautiful footprints behind.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Like the reviewer below this is not the type of music I typically listen to but I believe strongly that this is an album that people will be listening to in 20 years.    It is so perfect in fact that I believe that it leaves MGMT susceptible to the dreaded sophomore jinx.    Hope not though because these kids our talented and have found the perfect blend of psych folk and electronica.    Truly wonderful modern music.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is an innovative piece of zombie journalism. Consisting of interviews with survivors of the war, it charts its course from the initial outbreak to the aftermath of the eventual human victory.     Like all good zombie fiction, the real focus of the book is on human nature and the human reaction to the plague. The infection itself begins in (to Americans) out of the way parts of the world - South Africa, Brazil, China. It spreads as much due to human greed (the illegal organ trade, human trafficking) and arrogance (coverup by political authorities to preserve their own position and the regime in power) as it is due to the virulence of the infection. Both human strengths and failings come to light as the war progresses.     All in all, a very satisfying read. The retrospective interview format gives you something of a \\"god's eye view\\" of the action as they skip from one hotspot to another, where the reader has perspective that the interviewees did not at the time. At times, the inteviews gave the book a detached feeling, at others you felt you were right there with the action.    Highly recommend the novel if you enjoy zombie, survival or post apocalyptic fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome. I stayed up well past my lights out time to read it. Past midnight- which is pretty darn late for a twelve year old! It's torture to wait for Catching Fire to come out on Kindle, because I can't afford the hardcover version, and the library waiting list is more than two years! P.S. the people who think that Peeta is the best match for Katniss are insane. NO ONE understands and cares for her more than Gale.
B0013LKZWS|1.0|...of how record companies try to rip consumers off! The only difference between this version of \\"Little Voice\\" and the official one is the track \\"In Your Eyes\\", something that popped up on the Japan-only album. Everything else on the 2nd disc is nothing more than A BUNCH OF GLORIFIED REMIXES!!! One would be better served getting the original version of this album, then searching online for the extra song. At least, that way, you'd be getting your money's worth. SHAME ON YOU, SONY!!!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Its interesting how some movies can really not be promoted much at all and be better than some of the big budget, heavily marketed movies out there. Outlander was a movie I had never heard of before I saw it on Amazon so I figured I would try it out since I'm a sci-fi fan. The movie was definately not a let down and was enjoyable all the way to the end. If you enjoy science fiction and action movies this one is worth watching.

I'm not really in the mood to write a review, but his style, combined with the interesting path his life has taken him, makes for a great book! Two books by him aren't near enough, I hope he's working on his third!
B002NZK5VY|3.0|The actually chemistry between these two romantic comedy stars<br />is minimal: one doubts Sandra bullock saw anything in Hugh Grant?<br />The music in some cases is better than the dialog<br />( the piano singer at the charity event).<br />This movie is supposed to be opposites attract:<br />in real life these types of people would be murdering each other<br />if the poor type could get past the rich ones security guards?<br />What is amazing is this \\"formula\\" film is actually popular<br />with innocent idealistic girls?
B002TYZKIM|5.0|\\"Amazing\\" is such an over-used word, but not when you speak of MJ. This is a film I would watch over and over again just to see him move and to see him dispell half the garbage that gets printed about him. All you really need to know is right here...the talent, the discipline,the creativity, the joy. Unfortunately, the Jacksons chose to add their back-up vocals to the song at the end, which he had recorded in 1991.  I doubt seriously he EVER wanted to record anything with them again and would be livid by this. However, that's a minute criticism of this great snapshot into what would have been THE shows of the decade.
B0017T4IG0|1.0|Electric Dreams has not been released on region 1 DVD, (at least as of 11/01/09).    Therefore, this item is obviously an illegal bootleg. Which also means it is probably a very bad copy from a VHS tape.    Don't be fooled. Stay away.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Who ever said that MJ had lost it was dead wrong.  If anything he was better than ever.  I saw the movie on October 28, 2009.  I wasn't sure what I was going to see.  This film is respectful of Michael's memory and although we all know that this film was put together so the AEG could regain the cash that was intially laid out for the concert, I truly do not believe that it was exploitative.  I was able to see this film and for 2 hours, at least, forget that Michael was gone.  It's pretty much wall to wall music but it's also a look at the behind the scene, creative genius of the man himself.  That's a glimpse of MJ that is rarely seen by the public.  The voice is still there, the dance moves have not faded.  What you also see is MJ's gentle nature and love for his fans.  He wanted the fans to hear what they remembered.  He would gently correct the band if one note was missing by saying, \\"I know my music.\\"  He was not harsh but did demand perfection because he was a perfectionist.  If someone did miss a cue, he could be heard to say, \\"that's why we have rehearsal.\\"  There are some interviews with the dancers and the band but mostly, it's just MJ doing his thing.  Michael Jackson fans will treasure this film.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|What a way to celebrate the music and dancing of Michael Jackson.  This DVD is a must have to keep his legacy living and pass on his music to generations.  The movie is unbelievably wonderful and a little sad knowing that this is the last you will ever see of the \\"King of Pop\\"
B000SEFNMS|3.0|When I came accross tnis book, I purchased it right away because it was written by the same author of Into Thin Air, one of my all time favorite books. However, I find his writing style pompous in this book.     I sometimes use the dictionary anywhere from 0-6 times with each book.  After using the dictionary countless times, I started highlighting examples to share with you.    This story was interupted way too many times to look up 5 star words it disrupted the flow of the story for me. Here's a few example for you:    disquietude   anxiety  sobriquet   nickname  potting    to shoot   rictus    grin  inveigled    persuade  anorectic    anorexic  opprobrium   harsh criticism  convivial  friendly    I do not recommend this book at all.  I highly recommend Into Thin Air.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|Sure it could have been better. What movie couldn't be? Where they really went wrong was those space-aged suits that were just too futuristic for my liking. The Storm Shadow/ Snake Eyes conflict was amazing and I can't wait for Storm Shadow to have his revenge. Where was Snake Eyes' dog? The baroness is a goddess and I hope to see more of her in an evil role again. This movie really sets things up for the next one when (SPOILER) Cobra Commander takes control of Cobra and delivers the pain. GI Joe is action packed.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|There was, there is, and there will always be one KING OF POP!    And this film proves just that. It's a very entertaining, energetic and emotional experience for all the fans blessed to have seen this.
B002UD56I6|5.0|It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great, fascinating and authentic.  He is thin, but by no means \\"frail\\" as the media rumored at the news of his untimely death.  He was putting his all into this production and his inspiration was clearly to give the FANS something special.<br /><br />He gave precise instructions of what he wanted; he was extremely dedicated and focused - you see those tiny flickers of \\"genius\\" that set him apart. The film shows just how much Michael was respected and admired; but he never acted like the \\"king\\" he was... He had mutual respect for his cast and crew and labeled them all a \\"family\\".  He never once acted like a prima donna. When the cast wasn't performing, they went out in to join the production crew as an \\"audience\\" - and you could tell they were as giddy and excited as any \\"fan\\" experiencing this remarkable talent. When they would whoop and clap after one of his performances, he would humbly smile and say \\"God bless you.\\"  One thing I noticed is that when he did have to correct one of them, or explain what he expected on a musical piece or special effect, many times he'd follow his statement (which was made in a firm but soft voice) by saying  \\"with love\\".  I took this to mean what I've heard MJ quote many times - \\"do everything with love in your heart.\\"  It is painfully obvious to the viewer that this was actually a nice guy. Yes, there still remain those with  mixed feelings after all the bad things that have been said about him.  Watch this and tell me if you still believe them - before this we only saw the MJ that the largely critical media wanted us to see.  And critics have to be reminded - this was REHEARSAL footage for Michael's PRIVATE collection.  We were never supposed to see all this.  While this footage may not capture him at his best - his full-on adrenaline concert performances, his most incredible costumes -  it nonetheless has HUGE merit. This is MJ raw - his most honest portrayal.  He was not an \\"actor\\" in this film.  He was oblivious to the camera. I truly hope that \\"This is It\\" will weigh heavily on the consciences of the critics, media, false friends and greedy accusers and abusers of Michael. This man gave his all and lived a tortured life in return.  I hold those aforementioned traitors responsible in part - a large part -  for his untimely death.<br /><br />It's inspiring, riveting , bittersweet and funny.  MJ looked happy, confident and exuberant.  I found myself awestruck that this 50 year old could out dance someone half his age, and his voice was still as pure and strong as in his youth.  I found myself smiling and moving with the rhythms one minute -  then I would be struck with  profound sadness and in tears the next.  Many will watch This is It\\" and truly mourn the loss of this man - not just this performer - this MAN.  A humanitarian and a father, and a human being that despite fame and riches probably led more of a lonely, tortured  life than any of use could possibly fathom.  Not knowing who to trust - who is truly a friend and not some leech with an agenda. Having those closest to him, turn on him for profit.  No wonder he only trusted children - they don't have an \\"agenda\\" (unless of course their parents give them one for financial gain.) He reminds me of an ADULT child who was abused and confused at innocence lost and never got the help he needed to free those demons.  And turning to medication to numb himself and silence the critics in his mind is a sad, human fact for millions, not just MJ.  But most people could cry for help and be heard.  I think MJ was past that point and he just survived as long as he could.<br /><br />I am not (nor ever was)  an \\"obsessed\\" fan, or MJ groupie.  I went to two concerts and loved his music.  However, there was a time in the mid 90's, I'm ashamed to admit, when the negative press on MJ was at an all-time high and I thought that just \\"maybe\\" he wasn't such a nice guy.  I, like many of us, was very quickto judge based on the damning media, not the least of which was the airing of a MOCKumentary by ABC's Martin Bashir (who was an UNKNOWN until he did this to further his career and subsequent hire by ABC).  Bashir  \\"befriended\\" Michael and convinced him to let him do a special series entitled \\"Living with Michael Jackson\\"  that would show audiences the \\"REAL Michael\\".  He came to feed on him like so many others and any \\"human\\" portrayal of MJ was left on the editing floor, using only the most damaging footage for his crucifixion.  Michael being the trusting innocent and LONELY person he was thought that Bashir  was his savior - when in fact, he was Judas. I hope MJ's death haunts Mr. Bashir  the rest of his life.  Years later, I realized I was wrong to believe any of the massive propaganda designed to dethrone the king.  But, too little too late.  The damage sent him spiraling and into exile for a decade.  In a sense, I am one of the guilty, and yes, that will haunt me.  I don't pretend that MJ wasn't very different than the masses definition of \\"normal\\",  he had flaws like every human.  It's just that his were put under a microscope by those who get off on destroying others lives so that they don't have to look at their own damaged goods.<br /><br />On a positive note - there are plenty of fans who never once waivered in their admiration and love of Michael Jackson.  The first ten minutes of this film show his impact on all the dancers and entertainers that idolize him and were inspired by him.  Some even brought to tears by the magnitude of emotion with just being in his presence.<br /><br />I was born 13 days before MJ;  I understand the point he was at in his years and the resolution that comes with examining your life at the \\"half way point\\".  I have two young boys who never experienced the Jackson 5 or the years when the King of Pop reigned.  But they were right beside me at this movie and no doubt now appreciate and understand this legend that has, sadly, been lost forever.  Sadly, MJ's death also became a lesson in the cost of fame and fortune, and both the lightness and extreme darkness of the human soul.<br /><br />I can only hope this production causes all of us to examine our lives, our part in this world and with each other.

0385504225|2.0|This is the DaVinci Code set in Washington,DC. Langdon is goofy. The bad guy is so obvious that it's amazing that all these really smart people couldn't catch on to him. The ending is particularly annoying. It's a work of fiction, a story and it annoys me when people try to pass off their religious views in dialogue between two fictional characters. There is plenty of better reading out there. Don't waste your money just because it's a Dan Brown book. I made that mistake on John Grisham's last book too, buying because it was John Grisham and wasted a weekend on his last contractual obligation. I'll be looking for debut novels for a while!
0553293397|4.0|I just got done reading The Naked Sun in record time - over the course of a few measly days - and that, I suppose, is testament to just how compelling a writer Asimov was. Can you put it down once you stop? No. Would you be inclined to do so? Not likely. Having written hundreds of books, Asimov had honed his craft down to a tee. There are no lengthy expositions, superfluous descriptions,  esoteric metaphors, similes, or  other unnecessary literary devices in an Asimov book;  simply, there are characters, plot, world-building, and ideas, lots of ideas. If you've read, The Caves of Steel, or any other fiction by Asimov, and liked it, your sure to enjoy this book. as the second book in a trilogy, it felt slightly weaker than Caves, but held its own.  Plainclothesman Elijah Baley develops in this book far more than in the previous installment. one thing this tale lacks that the first one had is a sense of urgency and/or danger. Asimov seems to have dialed down the action a bit well cranking up the mystery. But hey - what, exactly, is wrong with that?
B002T3OWQ4|4.0|The new CW show The Vamp Diaries is catchy and slick.  It starts off slow but soon builds up some momentum.  You start to get the characters and their situations.  Good show I recommend it!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I really disagree with the other reviewers who slam this cd.  This is a reflective mellow winter cd.  It's not Sting singing Roxanne for the millionth time.  The songs have a certain wintry feel to them. I particulary like the songs Gabriel's Message, Soul Cake, The Snow It Melts the Soonest.  Great photos and notes also.    If you want a Police cd or a Sting pop cd don't buy this.  If you want a winter cd to sit next to the fire while drinking hot tea...then buy this.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|Call me a sinner if you will, but I truly believe this is my favorite Black Sabbath album (at least of the ones I own). From what I have, it's also my second favorite recording to feature Ronnie James Dio on vocals (the Dio album Holy Diver obviously takes the 1 spot). Every song is outright amazing, and the way the album is put together and produced is magnificent.<br /><br />NEW SOUND.<br />With the firing of Ozzy and the arrival of Dio, the blues-influenced riffing of tunes like \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" and \\"Hole In The Sky\\" were gone, and replaced with a more straight-ahead heavy approach. Even if the songwriting changed with Dio on board, the sound was still strictly Tony Iommi. His guitar sound has always been one-of-a-kind... exactly why it's happened that way, I do not know, but I can't help but admire him for never letting some big-name producer change, or possibly even ruin, his sound.<br /><br />ALBUM STRUCTURE<br />The album starts off with a BANG in the form of the fast, heavy rocker \\"Neon Knights.\\"<br />-Following this is \\"Children Of The Sea.\\" Somewhat of a ballad feel can be heard here, and the riff is an instant classic. A bit slow, but it doesn't drag. Geezer Butler is really on fire here.<br />-Track 3, \\"Lady Evil,\\" somewhat maintains the feel of earlier Sabbath works with its funky bass line and main guitar riff. The vocals have the true trademark Dio sound, and it never dies.<br />-Then of course, you have the title track. The lyrics are classic, the riff is immortal, the soloing is magnificent, and it never fails to get an audience going with its fist-pumping, foot-stomping beat.<br />-\\"Wishing Well\\" is the shining moment for the rhythm section of Geezer and drummer Bill Ward. Another nice touch is the bit of clean guitar backing up the main riff on a few sections of the song. One of the most overlooked tracks.<br />-Track 6, \\"Die Young,\\" is my favorite song from the album. It starts with a layer of keyboards coupled with a bit of free-form guitar licks from Tony, then turns into another rather frantic, proto-speed metal number. Dio's vocals and Tony's licks coupled with the cool keyboard parts make this one a serious winner.<br />-\\"Walk Away\\" slows things down a bit and is probably the weakest track on the album, aside from Geezer once again standing out big time. It does remind me a fair amount of something that Rainbow would have done.<br />-Finally, \\"Lonely Is The Word\\" closes out the album on a bit more of a slow note, but at the same time satisfies with its impressive soloing by Iommi for a good portion of the song.<br /><br />While some tracks stand out above others, there is not a bad time to be heard on this album, and it is truly one of the masterpieces of metal history. It is my favorite Sabbath album ever (once more, call me a sinner if you must) and right behind Holy Diver as far as recordings with Dio on vocals go.frantic, proto-speed metal number.

1596912863|5.0|I own that BBC mini-series starring Colin Firth. I've watched it so many times I'm surprised I haven't had to replace it, and I'm happily married. :o) Mr. Darcy is... well he's Darcy. At one point in the story Jane tries to explain the draw of being in her English resort holiday (and playacting as if she lived in Austen's time) by explaining that any woman would understand if she just talked about Colin Firth dripping wet. I think most of us can picture that scene without much trouble, but that wasn't what made me fall in love with Pride and Prejudice.    I loved the things that were in the book and pictured even better in the movie ~ their witty banter, the tension that built between them as they danced, him gazing at her across the room and agonizing with frustration at his growing regard... her surprise and the twinkle in her eyes as she came to know him better and realized her feelings for what they were...    This was all done to a great degree and on many levels in this book. The banter that regencies are so well known for was present on many levels - whether it was done on purpose as part of the acting or as a guard to keep up a pretense on some character's part... the effects ranged from funny to touching to sad.    The characters in the book were not cardboard cutouts even though many were \\"actors\\" playing parts. They were multi-dimensional and each one added something unique to the story. By the end I felt almost as if Jane were a friend of mine who had shared with me what had happened to her instead of a character in a story. This book did a good job of keeping a reader hooked, entertained, and surprised. I don't think Jane Austen would have been upset at all to have had her name and characters connected with it.    If you're a fan of Austen, I think you'll enjoy Austenland.

0545128285|2.0|Here we have a book of fairy tales that exist for the witches and wizards of the Harry Potter Series.<br />For the most part, the stories were not very memorable, and the notes written at the end of some of them, supposedly Dumbledore's thoughts about the tales, were too dry.

B002UD56I6|5.0|Wow, what a movie! Having seen MJ perform twice live during the Dangerous and History World Tours, it's a real pity we didn't get to see his creative genius culminate in This is It!    The movie provides glimpses of what was to be and it would have been a multimedia spectacular! Only someone like MJ could have had the vision of combining song and dance with film, on stage, with aerialists, fireworks and 3D effects.    The movie takes us through the songs that MJ was to perform. We see how he works with the musicians, director and choreographer. We see him laugh, goof up (e.g. forgetting the lyrics), chide, encourage, and most importantly, as he puts it \\"sizzle\\" and \\"simmer\\".    There are moments in the movie you feel his joy as he performs songs from the Jackson 5 era. He breaks into a smile at the end of \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\". He \\"misses his cue\\" as the set for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" begins, but firmly tells the Director that no he didn't miss his cue, he's just \\"sizzling\\" i.e. taking in the audience's adulation. You see the perfectionist at work, but you also see his playful innocence as he enjoys his ride on the cherry picker that was supposed to take him over the crowd.    Of course there were his trademark dance moves and his undeniable talent for singing. He doesn't go all out in every song, but when he does you realize he still had the performer in him.    The movie is bittersweet. You feel his joy as he steps through his rehearsals, but at the end you're left thinking what could have been. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Until then, fans and non-fans will just have to go to the movie theaters and watch glimpses of the concert that never came to fruition.
B000MV90IU|5.0|Most people remember this film for perhaps the best (or one of the best) car chase scenes in film history with Steve McQueen (driving himself) in a Mustang Fastback chasing two gangsters in a Dodge Charger up and down the hills of San Francisco. It is memorable to be sure, but the movie, as a whole, is decent. While there is some brief but bloody violence it's not just a shoot 'em up film. Steve McQueen insisted that it be realistic and as a result you do get inside the character's heads. You experience detective work as much of it really happens, methodical with patience. Bullitt is assigned to what should be a fairly routine witness protection weekend assignment at the request of Senator Chalmers (Vaughn) who is on a crusade to clean up the mob and get credit for it - the credit is what he mostly cares about. This is his star witness and the hearings will be his stage. However, the assignment quickly goes bad and Bullitt wants to find out who leaked the location and who are the assassins. There are enough twists and turns to keep you involved and, of course, there's the car chase. Roger Ebert likes it because the role of the stoic cop Bullitt is so close to the real Steve McQueen.
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is a beautifully directed 1994 movie by Peter Jackson which tells the true story of two teenage girls in New Zealand. This role was Kate Winslet's debut at age 17. She immediately went from this role to receive an Oscar nomination for Sense and Sensibility in 1995, followed by starring roles in Jude and Hamlet in 1996. Then came the bombshell that was Titanic in 1997.<br />Shortly thereafter, Peter Jackson directed three hugely successful Lord of the Rings movies in 2001-03. This is where it all began for two cinema legends. Don't miss it.
1410420442|5.0|From the first chapter, when President Snow greets Katniss with the reek of blood on his breath and delivers a horrifying ultimatum, CATCHING FIRE is terrifying.  THE HUNGER GAMES was terrifying, too, but - in my opinion - this second book in the trilogy is in a different league entirely.  In THE HUNGER GAMES everyone, the bigwigs in the Capitol and the tributes alike, needed to put on a good show.  The Gamemakers needed to keep the Capitol entertained, while the tributes needed to secure sponsors.  It was important to be popular, likable.  The tyranny of Panem and the murderous reality of the Hunger Games were glossed, fluffed, packaged, and everyone was complicit.<br /><br />In CATCHING FIRE, the gloves are off.  For one thing, the Games aren't new and exciting anymore - Katniss is no longer dazzled by the food, the clothes, the pampering.  She's seeing past it to the bigger picture, which is increasingly grim.  Rebellion is spreading like wildfire through the districts, thanks in part to Katniss.  Her defiance at the last Hunger Games has sparked a real revolt: factories and government buildings are attacked and supply chains disrupted.  The Capitol responds with heavy-handed brutality, flooding the outlying districts with Peacekeepers whose tools of justice are torture and execution.  District 12, so long overlooked, gets plenty of attention now - the electric fence is juiced, the Hob is burned to the ground, and a gallows constructed in the main city square.<br /><br />Of course Katniss alone isn't responsible for the rebellion - it's been a long time coming, as any reader of this series knows - but we also know that there is no mercy in the Capitol.  President Snow doesn't care about Katniss' intentions, just like he doesn't care that her mother and sister are good people who don't deserve to be tortured or killed.  And that's what he says to Katniss, when he visits her.  She's to quell the unrest during her Victory Tour, or else she - and everyone she holds dear - will pay.<br /><br />Of course, it's an impossible task.  Katniss cannot single-handedly reverse the revolution, no matter how hard she tries.  That's when she makes the next, even more awful realization: she's supposed to fail.  She's a problem, and the Capitol wants her dead.<br /><br />The Gamemakers aren't playing around either.  This book charts the seventy-fifth Hunger Games, and the occasion of a Quarter Quell.  Every twenty-five years the Hunger Games are turned up a notch, given some gruesome twist.  Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's mentor, won the games during a Quarter Quell - for his year, the number of tributes taken from each district was doubled.  This year's twist is a doozy, perhaps because there is such an urgent need to remind Panem's citizens why the Games exist in the first place, to make them feel helpless.  No spoilers here, so no details...suffice to say that the 75th Hunger Games are less like entertainment than the 74th were, and more like an object lesson.  The arena itself is really just a torture chamber.<br /><br />There are enough twists and turns in CATCHING FIRE to tie a snake into knots, and while it's less of a thrill ride than THE HUNGER GAMES was it's the perfect sequel - a thought-provoking, heart-in-your-throat page-turner that accomplishes exactly what its title suggests.  It takes the small-scale rebellion of the Girl Who Was On Fire to the next level, makes her personal rebellion a national call to arms.

B000Y7U98W|3.0|This review is strictly for the uncut, cable-tv version. I do not have any of the DVDs or Blu-Ray.    Sunshine is a pretty good movie up until the last thirty minutes.  Then, it becomes quite predictable, silly and kind of unrealistic (even in a sci-fi way), which is too bad, because if they had just kept tempo Sunshine could have ranked as a cult classic right up there with Pitch Black..  One aspect that doesn't disappoint is the soundtrack.  Very topnotch and appropriate.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to exist outside of the film.
0375831002|5.0|This book was one of the only ones that made me very emotional after reading it. I decided to use this book for a report, and the blurb seemed interesting so I borrowed it out of the library. The length was a little off-putting since I had to do the report in a week but as soon as I started reading I became engrossed in it. I would read many pages during my breaks at school, and soon I began to feel sympathy for all the characters and I felt as if I were connected to them. Once I finished this book, I was speechless. Nothing could describe the emotions that went through me while reading The Book Thief. The conclusion shocked me and I admit that I cried. It was very sad.    I love this book. It's extremely creative -- it's told from the view of \\"Death.\\" Liesel is a well developed character whose innocence is excellently portrayed by Zusak. I have to admit, this Markus Zusak is a good author. Every single aspect of the plot melded together perfectly, and he finished everything in a compelling yet heartbreaking scene. I will always remember this book, and I always list this as my favorite book on sites such as Facebook. :P    I know there are so many good reviews for this book but I felt that I just had to speak my mind. Peace out, buy this book.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|I grew up watching GI Joe cartoons in the early 90's, when reruns of the Sunbow series would air in the morning and the new episodes from DIC would air in the afternoon. I was crazy about the toys, and managed to amass quite an army back in my heyday. If you're like me and miss the days of smacking around the iconic 4\\" plastic soldiers in the back yard, this movie manages to re-capture that same feeling, but for adults. It's big, loud, fun, and full of tanks, lasers, terrorists, ninjas, high-tech gadgets and all that good stuff that made us giddy for the show.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie isn't without problems-- first of all, the special effects are a very mixed bag. A lot of them look fine, but when they're bad, it basically looks like a cartoon. Also, even though Channing Tatum certainly looks the part of Duke, the man simply cannot act. Also, Ripcord's flirting with Scarlett felt completely forced, and his lines sounded like they were written by someone who has never talked to a girl. Also, many fans will probably be disappointed by some of the big changes made to The Baroness in the movie, however I liked Sienna Miller's performance as her enough that I was willing to accept it. Younger fans probably won't care about such changes that much, but the hardcore Baroness fans will.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie isn't without some shining performances, though. As I said, Sienna Miller was good as Baroness, in spite of the changes to her character, and aside from Channing Tatum most of the cast ranges from pretty good to great. One of the real standouts of the movie though, was The Doctor / Cobra Commander. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the movie version very successfully captured the essence of the cartoon version's voice, but at the same time made it much more imposing and threatening sounding. Of all the performances in the movie, I felt that one was the true stand out.<br /><br />And of course, with Snake Eyes being my favorite Joe, I have to mention him in here. I thought they nailed Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow pretty much perfectly, and my only complaint was that Snake Eyes was not in the movie more, and that we didn't get a chance to explore his relationship with Scarlett (which was hinted at, but not elaborated on). Their fight scenes were awesome, and you'd be hard pressed to ask for a better on-screen interpretation of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow without resorting to trivial nitpicking.<br /><br />Overall, this movie gets my seal of approval. It's not perfect, but it was better than most of the other big-budget fair I've seen this summer. I only saw two movies in the theater twice this year: one was Star Trek, and the other was GI Joe. If you're a fan of GI Joe, nostalgic about the 80's, or simply enjoy big loud action movies and military stuff, this movie was made for you.here.

B002BFIN6K|5.0|I recall fondly these old Victor Rachmaninoff recordings (along with his Stowkowski-four concertos) and to have them restored in this stunning Zenph-Sony Masterwork CD is a real gift.  The sound is crystal clear and dynamic and they show Rachmaninoff's amazing technical piano mastery and power. I highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in not only Rachmaninoff but great piano music in general and state-of-the-art sound recordings. This CD is a great follow-up to the wonderful Zenph-Sony Glenn Gould Goldberg Variation disc and I hope they continue to re-release great recordings in the future.

B00009MGGI|5.0|I was in my early 20s and living in the UK in the early 1990s when this series is set and it brings back many memories. I had neither seen nor heard of the Trilogy and bought it from Amazon based upon the reviews. It is absolutely superb - acting, plot, atmosphere and true to the times. I recommend it without hesitation, and once I opened the box, I watched all 12 episodes back to back over 5 evenings. Not to be missed!
B000002KEV|5.0|Made in Japan captures Purple at the height of the Mark II success. (Later incarnations of the band simply do not reach the musicianship on display here). The playing is frenetic. Highway Star is played at such breakneck speed as to take your breath away. It contains the now classic solos from Jon and Ritchie. Jon's solo is based on a Bach progression and Ritchie's on a Mozart sequence. The playing is precise. Glover and Paice are in my opinion the best ever rhythm section in all of rock. Ritchie Blackmore displays throughout the album why he is one of the best if not the best ever rock guitarist. (His playing is leagues above Jimmy Page's). From superb precise fast playing to tasteful solos. His solos on Strange Kind of Woman is one of his finest-the note selection, phrasing is wonderful to hear. To the young players-it isn't always about playing the fastest scales. The version of Smoke on the Water is in my opinion THE definitive version of this song (and I have heard well over 300 in my life). Lazy is superb-I love Jon Lord's intro-getting those sounds out of the Hammond and then going into a jazzy bit. Ritchie's spontaneity where he breaks into Swedish Rhapsody is priceless. Space Truckin' is fun. The Mule showcases Paice's drumming abilities and shows why he is one of the best. Child in Time is really good. It is always amazing to hear how Lord and Blackmore play all those fast notes together. They really did bring out the best in each other. What is truly amazing about this album is that what you hear is what happened. There is no going back to the studio and fix something, overdub something, etc. The tapes were simply mixed and the power on display is evident.    Another superb live album from Purple is Live in Stockholm - 1970. This comes from the period where Purple was still pretty much an underground band and had not had the critical success that would come in a few years. However, some of the shows they did from this era are some of the most exciting they were to ever do. The version of Child in TIme here is in my opinion their best. Ritchie's solo is mind blowing. During this time period, they did some incredible improvisational segments (going anywhere from 20-40 minutes in length!) and as a result their shows would run well over 2.5 hours! Chekc out Wring that Neck - some incredible improvs. Purple had the ability to do rock, jazz, classical, blues and it is all demonstrated here. Mandrake Root was the lengthy show closer (replaced by Space Truckin' later on) complete with strobe light sequence. There is a version of Black nIght on here which is one of my favorites as Gillan and Blackmore duel it out at the end.    To sum, Deep Purple were best on stage. They are all superb musicians. Their live shows/albums are better than the studio versions. In my opinion, the two best ever rock bands were Deep Purple and ELP. Why? - those two bands have the best ever musicians and gave superb concerts. (I am a keyboard player myself and Jon Lord and Keith Emerson were the two I tried to emulate the most). It is interesting how Led Zeppelin gets all the accolades. While a good band, they really do not compare to Purple. (I was at the concert that became The Song Remains the Same - it was an okay performance). Purple deserves to be in the Rock Hall of Fame. If you are not familiar with Deep Purple, Made in Japan is an excellent introduction.

0385504225|3.0|I just finished The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown, one of those writers who keep your interest. I have enjoyed his first four books immensely.     I had a bad feeling about the fifth book before it was published. It took a long time to write. This often indicates that the book was laborious to write. When I write something about a subject, I like it to flow like a stream bolstered by major rainfall. The Lost Symbol did not flow out of Dan Brown's mind easily and smoothly. Its gestation was more like a tough pregnancy ending with severe labor pains. The results were all the worse for the stretching and pushing to bring it to term and deliver it.     After a mega-masterpiece like The Da Vinci Code, the next book would have to meet very high standards to be favorably compared with its predecessor. Pressure and great art sometimes do not go together. While purely fictional books like Digital Fortress, Deception Point and Angels & Demons were excellent, his success with The Da Vinci Code, a book that blends credible and controversial historical events and \\"what ifs\\" together with fiction, meant that his editors and his public would be looking for more of the same. This was apparently not a realistic expectation. The Da Vinci Code was a one-time breakout novel with popularity matching or exceeding the masterpiece Gone with The Wind by Margaret Mitchell, the only novel she ever published. Ms. Mitchell knew publishing anything after that novel would just dim her historical achievement. Dan Brown probably felt the same pressure but financially found it an irresistible feat he would have to attempt.     The Lost Code was over five hundred pages. The excellent writing style of Dan Brown compelled me to read the first four hundred pages with great excitement. These pages flew by in a two evening session. Even at this point I felt there was no credible end game for his plot to top off the previous, intense action. Unfortunately I was right. The last hundred pages were a chore to read. The last fifty pages were truly painful.     The ending was disappointing. No revelations, no glorious wonderment, no historical impact was forthcoming. It lingered and died failing to take the reader to the same level as its predecessor. The attempt fell way short.    It was not without some interesting moments. It did have its share of historical factoids. There will be some readers walking around Washington DC to trace the monuments where the action took place.     Kudos to Dan Brown for the moments which made me want to hop aboard the Washington Metro and visit these places which I have ignored too long, living only five miles from the Capital. At the end I was ready slip my Metro Pass into the \\"maybe one day department\\" on my to-do list. The excitement vanished with the end of the novel.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I first saw Joe on a Saturday early morning show. I was blown away just watching him play solo in a small tv studio. I immediately bought So, it's like that, and I was hooked. Ever since first really listening to Led Zep in high school I have loved heavy Blues guitar. Stevie Ray Vaughn has been my guitar idol for years and his early death put a damper on blues music and its popularity kind of faded. A few new names have come since then- Derek Trucks, Johnny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shephard, more recently Orianthi, to name a few. But Joe is in another league when it comes to talent and showmanship. I have seen him a couple times live in relatively small venues and Joe puts every ounce of himself into his performance whether the audience is 250 or 5000. He is a workaholic of the purest sense and this video shows just how talented a musician he is, not just some fast riffing guitar god.  Joe is what aspiring musicians should strive to be, dedicated and appreciative for getting where you are through hard work and not slacking once you reach financial success. He is still in my opinion not that well recognized by the general public although he is like 4 time voted best blues guitarist still running.   To some the intro on the video and the booklet seems a little self indulgent explaining how hard he has worked to get the chance to do this concert ever since his dad showed him Cream perform here. But I think it's just him explaining how important it is to work hard for what you enjoy and always to excel at whatever that may be.   Don't miss a chance to see Joe and his regular band on tour- he tours almost constantly and mostly to pretty small audiences since he is relatively unknown and you can see him up close in these small venues instead of a stadium nosebleed seat.   This DVD shows Joe at his best and the expanded band setup sounds great. The double drummer setup is fun to watch, I have only seen this with the Dead and Genesis previously.
4789009637|1.0|This is a horrible book. Why the Genki series gets so many good ratings on Amazon, I don't know. Perhaps it's the fact that for some odd reason more people than usual seem to be rating the sellers in the PRODUCT RATING area.    Anyway, this book is much like the Nakama and the Yookoso series. They don't take the learner seriously and the whole program is extremely childish. While popular on community college (and unfortunately even on University) Campuses, the Genki series is horrible for any learner. Like Nakama, it pushes learners to have the many gaps it leaves filled by Japanese instructors. Why not just forgo the pleasure of dropping $50 on a useless book?    The grammar explanations in Genki, like Nakama, are simplistic and examples are insufficient. Again as in Nakama, useless \\"cultural\\" aspects of Japan and the Japanese language, such as how to write letters in the language share as much of the spotlight as anything that would be useful.     The vocabulary and the format of the series are atrocious. The most common complaint of the book from both teachers and students is that the vocabulary is simply an illogical and useless mishmash that often has no correlation to the dialogue at the beginning of the chapter or to anything at all. The most famous example of this would be that the first chapter of the second book, which is supposed to be about restaurant service introduces the Japanese word for \\"UFO.\\" This is ridiculous. The coverage of vocabulary is also glaringly insufficient. The grammatical explanations also follow such chaotic placement throughout the book with no linearity and complex grammatical structures being presented here or there at the author's whim before or after more simplistic ones. This book is so bad that one can almost just pick up the second book and start off from there with no effect on the learning process (assuming one knows the Japanese writing system, of course).    Like Nakama, this book is also a rip-off. It comes with no audiofor the student, so it's useless for self-studying. To get the exercises you need to build ability, you also have to buy an overpriced pencil-thin workbook. This is where it differs from Nakama - although they are the same price, the workbook for Nakama is far superior to the Genki one. Expect to drop some 80 dollars list-price to not learn Japanese.    Ultimately, this ill-conceived series of Japanese textbooks should be considered a shame by the Japan Times. And it's also shameful of teachers to push this kindergarten Japanese text in Universities across the country.    Why does it get good reviews? My guess is as good as anybody else's. This book has very few positive points, but it looks extremely good and the paper is of very high quality. It's all flash and no delivery, just like the Japan Times newspaper. The only good thing about this book is that it covers Kanji to an acceptable level.     So why good reviews? I challenge anyone who has become fluent in Japanese in their adult age and used this book as a first two-year starting point to give me an answer. Any takers? I didn't think so.
1932100385|5.0|If what T. Colin Campbell and his son Thomas Campbell are saying is true, then this is one of the most significant findings ever in the field of nutrition and diet.  I know from personal experience that improving one's diet by not eating meat and milk products and replacing them with fruits and vegetables has incredible effects on the human body.    This book argues from strong empirical evidence gathered from many studies that all sorts of health disorders can be influenced and even reversed by a whole foods, plant-based diet.  Though most people will not read all the pages of this book and could probably just read chapters 11-12 for his conclusion, the pages in between produce a very scientific, empirically sound, cogent argument in favor of a healthy diet.    Perhaps his strongest arguments are from his findings related to casein, which comprises 87% of cows milk protein, being able to turn on and turn off the presence of cancer.  In his chapter regarding lessons from China, after completing the massive study they found \\"more than 8,000 statistically significant associations between lifestyle, diet, and disease variables\\" (p. 73).    With respect to these findings, I think most people either don't know about this, know something about it but don't want to make any changes in their diet, or have made changes and are seeing results.  The hard part is discipling yourself to live and eat this way in a world filled with fast food, social events with bad food, emotional eating, and a host of other things to pull you down.  Yet even small changes can make a difference over time.
0439023483|5.0|Loved both of the Hunger Games books thus far! Can't wait for the next one out next year.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I SAW THE MOVIE, WHAT A LOST TO US ALL.  MICHAEL JACKSON WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS CONCERT , IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST COMEBACK.  YOU FELT THE LOVE, THAT MICHAEL WANTED SO MUCH FOR THIS WORLD. MICHAEL I MISS YOU AND I WANT YOU BACK, IT FEELS LIKE A BAD DREAM. BUT UNTIL WE ALL MEET AGAIN, SLEEP WELL.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|So yeah, I'm late to the game having only found Muse after Twilight came out. I bought Black Holes for one song and was impressed with the whole album. When the New Moon soundtrack came out, I bought it just for the Muse song, so I decided to give another CD a try. One listen of The Resistance and I haven't found one song I'd skip, that's saying a lot for me. In my 30s, Muse makes me nostalgic for the days when I first discovered Queen (1992!) and bought their entire canon, so felt compelled to do the same for Muse and eagerly awaiting their arrival. Stand-outs for me: Exogenisis, United States of Euroasia, Uprising, I Belong to You.
B002I6251G|2.0|The past two albums from Editors have consisted of well crafted, thought provoking songs.  Unique guitar riffs combined with Tom Smith's dark voice have made for a very intriguing atmosphere of sound.    This album isn't a far cry from the first two albums style wise.  The downfall of this album isn't so much the electronic synthesizers, which work fairly well for the most part, but the song writing.  Songs feel as if they were hastily written, without much thought or effort.  I would even go so far as to call some lyrics callow.  The songs seemed to be burdened with over-repetition to compensate for a lack of quality song writing.    So forget the Interpol comparisons, Julian Plenti would have not let an album like this escape the studio.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This was not as good as the Davinci Code. It was a good read but did drag at times. It could have been cut down. The ending was enjoyable.  It just took too long to get there.
0307474275|2.0|As Edgar Allan Poe said about 'Pilgrim's Progress', \\"ludicrously overrated book,\\" and also in the case of 'The Da Vinci Code' the film is even worse!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw the movie.I felt I was in the concert.  He dedicated himself in this movie,I think.  This is a very precious one!  If there are another scenes captured,I want to see more and more.    In this film,we can see Michael again.He is alive,in this film.
141041986X|4.0|The Hunger Games was quite a page turner, and while I did enjoy it, I didn't quite love the book.    I'm not going to go through the plot as quite a few people have read it, or if they haven't, there are plenty of sources to find that information. I will say that the plot was, in my view, the best part of the book. As I said above, it's quite a page turner, but although I didn't think the writing was bad per se, I didn't feel it was up to par with The Giver by Lois Lowry or The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer. The romance angle in the book irritated me a bit. I understand to a degree why it was necessary to the plot, but I thought it could have been a little more well done. Another minor irritation was the naming of the characters in the book. I suppose it was done on purpose, but I felt it distracted me from the story every time I came upon a strange name. I've never really noticed it in books like Lord of the Rings, etc., but in this book the names just seemed a bit silly.    Even with all that said, I did like the book quite a bit and plan on reading the entire trilogy. I hate to be too negative when I actually enjoyed it, but since it's received so many rave reviews, I just thought I'd explain why my rating was a little lower.
B00000272N|5.0|first A.I.C. cd ever owned and is as good as i remember.  quick shipping as well.  thanks
B00288KNL8|2.0|For starters the stop motion animation and 3-D effects are pretty darned good here.  That's about it.  My complaint with alot of 3-D movies is that they fashion the movies around the effects at the expense of the story.  There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy.  Who were they targetting for this flick?  Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them?  Disaffected adolescents who glory in unsavory imagery?  Whatever!  Ultimately \\"Coraline\\" is just a waste of time.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|This is a movie about women. Men rarely appear and when they do are usually loutish and brutish. The women seem completely self-sufficient, mutually supportive, brave and resourceful.<br /><br />The memorable opening scene makes the point. Women from a village in the Spanish plains are busy polishing and cleaning their husbands' headstones and tombs. The camera widens and we see scores and scores of women.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz gives a wonderful performance. Her presence lights up the screen even when she is seen weeping bitterly. At such moments, she looks almost haggard but her inner beauty shines through.<br /><br />Cruz is at the fulcrum of this movie. I don't want to disclose any surprises so I'll simply say the story concerns three generations of women, all of whom have to overcome the trauma of ill-treatment by men. They do so by painfully uniting.<br /><br />The photography is frequently arresting and the story engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Just released: Strict Joy by The Swell Season (recommend the Deluxe Edition because it contains additional live performances, including their mega hit \\"Falling Slowly.\\")<br /><br />That's right! 33 tracks.<br /><br />This CD is every bit as impressive as the Soundtrack from \\"Once.\\" I must confess I had never heard of them before seeing the film, Once. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are magical together (and lack something apart in my opinion). He gives her classical Czech, free-flowing instrumentals a harder, modern form. She gives his raw, Irish, folk rock ballads a lyrical, vocal and orchestral beauty and softness. Together they combine unlike forms and create new sounds and colors they cannot create or perform alone.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />My very favorite new tracks:<br /><br />The Rain<br />High Horses<br />The Verb<br />In These Arms<br />Fantasy Man<br />I Have Loved You Wrong (A Live Version, too that is haunting)<br />Love That Conquers<br />Two Tongues<br /><br />LOVE THEM!!!!<br /><br />The article refers to the song \\"The Verb,\\" which Hansard wrote when he was with the Frames that he said was too dark to record before now. Irglova lightens it up at the end and it is absolutely magical!<br /><br />My favorite live performances include:<br /><br />Drown Out (beautiful song)<br />Fitzcarraldo (another beautiful song)<br />Falling Slowly<br />All The Way Down (beautiful version)<br />When Your Mind's Made Up<br />If You Want Me<br />Go With Happiness<br />Lies<br />The Low (another gorgeous version)
B000FCKGPC|4.0|About two thirds of the way through 'Feast for Crows', I was struck by the thought that either the book is boring filler material or else it's darn brilliant beyond belief, and it's really hard to tell the difference.  Numerous other reviewers have spoken to the first alternative, please allow me to speak up for the second.    The mood is dreary and pessimistic. Fields and villages are burned, local governments have collapsed, brutish looters prevail, navies have been decimated, remaining troops are unnerved and raggedy, peasants have been indiscriminately slaughtered and raped and mutilated, and Cersei is having financial problems.  There is no food, no money, and no hope; life is nasty, brutish, and short. With a few exceptions the honorable and competent have been slaughtered, assassinated, or killed in battle. Those leaders remaining are vicious, drunken, stupid, or weak. Westeros stagnates in all respects. Moreover, northern barbarians and zombie ghouls are on the march southward into civilized lands although few Westeros folk realize this yet. \\"Winter is coming\\".     You can't read the book without sharing in the hopelessness and being repelled by the appalling violence.  The bottom line is that the entire country is ripe for a takeover, the leader on a white horse who will inspire hope and lead Westeros out of its hell.  This is the theme of the book. It is a major change in pacing from the exciting plot elements of the preceding books.  It is (I hope) setting up the scene for a brilliant finale and denouement.    I think I have figured out how the story will play out, and who will be the three heads of the dragon.  Well, two of the heads anyway.  Estimating Mr. Martin's writing speed, we had all better sharpen our pens and start cranking out fan fiction.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|In 2002 'In Absentia' was the first album of PT I heard and I was blown away. Ever since, I got everything I could lay my hands on and discovered a band with a range as wide as a starsystem. Steven Wilson is an absolute genius but, to my oppinion, it's not all gold the man touches (I'm not that fond of No Man for example). With PT however, he strikes the motherlode every single time.   The anticipation after In Absentia, Deadwing and Fear of a Blank Planet was high though. Could PT realy deliver another album as good as its predecessors. The answer is 'yes' but...there is a but. The Incident is 'different' from the latter three. PT mixes their sound of the old days, the more psychedelic soundscapes (The Sky Moves Sideways, Up the Downstair...) with the harder rocksound they built out on Ansentia, Deadwing and Planet. By this it almost seems like we hear a new band. I must admit, the first time I heard The Incident, I wasn't that enthusiastic and I can very well understand, if this is the first PT you hear, you may be frowning an eyebrow or two. But after a few sessions, the music, the wonderful lyrics, the dark atmosphere where Steven Wilson excels in...it all kicks in...without mercy. On CD 1 we hear fourteen masterfully woven songs, all about every day 'incidents', from a car crash to neighbours from hell, from first love to lost friendship. This belongs, to my oppinion, to their very best work. CD 2 has only four songs, but again from a quality of the highest standard. The whole takes you on a seventy-five minute tour with not a single weak moment.  In general I'm quite critical when it comes to music, and I'm not afraid to have a negative opininion even about my most favourite bands (e.g. I think Dream Theater is going to a downfall with no return...which I absolutely regret...) but in the sad landscape of contemporary music, Porcupine Tree is a rare gem, four musicians who work as a band and bring music that exites, enchants and surprises every time. Five stars!
B002CAWNEM|4.0|I didn't go into this flick with heightened expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was more than a \\"Fatal Attraction\\" retread with an interracial angle.  There were some fresh insights on sexual obsession and office interraction between the sexes explored here.  The performances by the principal actors was uniformly solid, notably Idris Elba.  The only real debit is an utterly predictable catfight finale that was telegraphed miles away.  Not profound, but I place it behind \\"Play Misty For Me\\" and before the criminally overrated \\"Fatal Attraction\\" in this genre.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael has been my biggest inspiration. The first music video i have ever seen was Thriller. When he died, i was so saddened. This movie is such and incredible insight into how this genius works his magic. Michael is someone that can never be replaced. His legend lives on forever. This movie not only brings you into the \\"This is It\\" rehersals, but it also shows you what a loving, kind, innocent, wonderful, TALENTED man Michael Jackson was. \\"This Is It\\" was simply tremendous. Although i have always been obsessed with Michael and I have always had a deep love for him and his music, many people have discriminated against him and haven't even bothered to look into who he was and what he stood for. If you see \\"This Is It,\\" you will leave without a doubt in your mind, that Michael Jackson was simply a pure, innocent, loving, kind, amazing, and so so generous man. THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. You definitely will not be disappointed.
B002SQ3664|5.0|You know when we saw taking Woodstock I had expected something I guess different that what was brought to the screen.What I had expected to see was the concert acts rehashed throughout the movie,what I got was something even better a movie that brought a good feeling and made me really feel good when I left the Movie Theater.Everything in the movie just fit in so well,from the towns people who hated the rush into their town but found that all those kids were genuine and caring,to a dreamer who was in fact gay and found his own being throughout the movie.I felt this movie was sort of like many other movies in the past like Goonies and nanny Mcfee that were never really given there push when they came out,but make everyone feel good every time you see them.Taking Woodstock should have enjoyed so much more critical acclaim but if you saw the movie you know it did not need that to take away from the movie something good inside yourself,and always carry with you that maybe we cant always judge people by their outright appearence but should take from them what they have inside of themselves...i wish the company would have did the blu ray with the regular version disc like disney does,but well see which one I buy.Incidently just to see the brownie seen in the movie is worth the whole trip,if you dont know what i mean by that buy the movie..

B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana has this low sexy voice and sings some of the romantic love songs I remember so well from my youth. A dramatic departure from the cacophony of \\"modern\\" music.  And for jazz aficionados, piano is the primary instrument played like you remember.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I absolutely love the Harry Potter books but fans should really stop comparing them to the movies so much. These movies aren't made to be an exact adaptation of the books (as few movies based on books are). This is an outstanding film that is quite possibly the best in the series. I wish people would stop griping about which parts were left out.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This movie is HANDS DOWN one of the most excellent THRILLER movies I have seen! Damion from \\"The Omen\\" and \\"The Good Son\\" ain't got NOTHING on THIS evil little girl! OR IS she a little girl after all??? It's a great thriller that builds up,you will not want (OR DARE!) to leave your seat 5 minutes into this film!The Children of the Corn are mere puff cakes compared to this missy of mayhem!Move over Chuckie,there is a new tiny terror in town!And her name is Esther!
1416594787|4.0|This is a valuable book for anyone interested in adding to their understanding of evolution. Dawkins offers insight and solid scientific example. You will really enjoy the last chapter and Appendix.    I was hoping Dawkins would be more understanding and considerate of non-believers this time. Instead of his jihad to jam it down their throats, I was hoping for a kinder explanation of why he prefers science and reason over the supernatural. Even though he has toned it down some, he still comes off as pedantic and condescending, at times burying opposition in scientific minutia. There were times I had enough and skipped ahead.    Disappointingly, I doubt this book will be read by anyone who dismisses evolution and very few who have their doubts    Don't skip over the section on trees in the forest and the section on predator and prey.

B002Q4U9YU|4.0|God, listening to this double disced soundtrack and seeing the movie This Is It, it makes me really wish that Michael could've went out with a bang like he would have during this fifty night stay at the O2 Arena. Because, from what I saw on the movie, and what I hear on the soundtrack, it was going to be nothing but pure magic from beginning to end.<br /><br />The soundtrack, on disc one, is choked full of old favorites that I'm sure he would have been performing, since he was promising fans he would perform the songs they wanted to hear. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" the controversial \\"Earth Song,\\" the controversial \\"They Don't Care About Us,\\" and \\"Jam,\\" amongst other songs...this would have been the perfect way to go out if you were going to go out.<br /><br />Even the new song, which isn't new, but it is, \\"This Is It,\\" really shows you Michael's true talent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Michael passed away a few weeks before these scheduled concerts were to begin; but we always have the memories, and now, we have both the movie and the soundtrack to \\"This Is It,\\" what would have been Michael's final curtain call as a performer.<br /><br />And, from what I've heard and seen, we're missing out on what would've been his best work yet. Makes you sad to think about it.
B001W79MBI|5.0|Well, as was enevitable some users have given this movie a poor rateing, it was at 5 starts for the longest time. One user said it was boring and he was too old for anime, and another gave an inpresively long review of the movie and why he didn't like it. Well for the guy who is too old for anime because he's 23, perhaps you should not watch anime? The other user said he found the movie to gory and action was too predictable, the story one giant cliche and the charcters were under developed and I can respect his opinion.     First lets get to the gory action. I love it. One thing that really impressed me was unlike other animes like samurai X, and the movie highlander search for vengance and countless others, instead of just seeing a downward sword slash, follwed by a charcter splitting in too or dying after a few seconds delay you actually get to SEE the sword play and a a few lenghty fights. The choreogrophy was amazing and the best i've seen in an anime and you can tell they put alot of work and thought into it, and yes its very bloody. But hey if u dont like blood you arent going to appreaciate this aspect of the movie.     The story, yes its is very cliche but you could say the same for ninja scroll(an evil villain wants to take over the world and one man can stop him), and vampire hunter D(girl gets catptured by evil vampire, half vampire hero saves her and falls in love with her). What really makes a story interesting is not so much the story itself but the CHARACTERS in the story. For me thats what makes movies like ninja scroll,vampire hunter D and Sword of the stranger really enjoyable. Not many people will enjoy a movie if they dont like the characters regardless of the plot. Which brings me to the next section    Characters. Well if you havent allready guessed it, I really liked the characters. Nameless, that kid(forgot his name) and tobby maru the dog. For me theyve all been developed, though subtley. Nameless is a skilled warrior with a haunted past, but he's genuinly a pretty nice guy, that kid (i should probably have gooegled his name) is sarcastic and acts tough but you can tell its just a mask, that really he is pretty damned scared. And lets not forget tobby maru, who has allot of personallity for a non person. Generous loyal and brave, he gives his fish to nameless upon meeting him.     \\"Ok yeah we get it, you love this movie and are obviously a fanboy who cant take people critizing his favorite movies\\". Oh contrair mon ami, there were a few things i didnt like about the movie. For one the colors seemed pretty bland, mostly browns(eww the color of doo doo) and yes i admit it wasnt the most original story ever told(why do all these animes villains have to aquire a child as the key to fulfilling thier evil plan? ex: metropolis, Sin the movie nad lots more).    Any way the thing that really did it for me besides the jaw dropping animation and truely loveabe(IMO)characters? The Ending, an epic sword battle follwed by what i thought was an extremly happy ending. Man i'm a sucker for happy endings. Well thats give it a shot, unless youre too old for anime that is ;)
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This film was even better the second time I watched it in the theater. That's why I will be ordering this DVD.  We celebrate Michael and we mourn the great loss of him.  With the talents and dedication of Kenny Ortega and all the crew, we are able to see what so few got to see.  I am grateful for this gift so we may continue to realize and marvel at the man.  He's left us a legacy; I'm so glad the footage of this \\"could-have-been\\" concert is available for all of us to see and not left in some box or archive somewhere.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Having purchased the previous Fawlty Towers complete series on DVD set three years ago, I was skeptical as to whether the \\"Remastered\\" version was worth it.  I can assure you that it is.  John Cleese's hilarious and insightful commentary alone is worth the extra investment.  As well, the sound and picture quality are noticeably better, adding to the enjoyment.  Highly recommended even if you have previously purchased the series on VHS or DVD.  Enjoy!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I've been to the theater twice with 2 more shows scheduled. I can't get enough. Michael is amazing as he creates his masterpiece. If you are a fan then this is a must see. He's doing what he loves, creating magic. You can't help but bob your head to the music and tap your feet to the beat. I totally enjoyed TII and I thank Michael Jackson most of all for this gift and I thank Kenny Ortega and the amazing dancers, musicians and all the techs that helped put this HIStory together.I also ordered the DVD. All I can say is WOW! It's MAGIC Baby! Let that Simmer. L*O*V*E
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I highly recommend This Is It to everyone to see.  It is a phenomenal performance which showcases Michael's incredible talent as well as his humanity.  It is bittersweet watching this show knowing Michael is now gone but nevertheless how wonderful this footage was shot so we can all still enjoy his last performances.  We are treated to alot of Michael's tried and true songs as well as his new This Is It.  This movie proves once again what an incredible talented genius Michael was.  His legacy lives on.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Originally watched this on t.v. and found it very confusing to decifer between characters when you had to wait a week for the next show.  Some of the characters looked very similar to one another ...  While I enjoyed it first run, watching it again without having to wait so long between episodes has made the experience much more pleasant.  This is a show that I will watch again and again.
1552095258|5.0|This book has a great way of sharing both wood working skills along with a history of paddles. If you want to build your own then this book goes a long way to helping you understand the timbers required and the methods used both historically and current. I recommend it.
B002MW50KY|1.0|Bob Dylan is Jewish and routinely generously contributes to Jewish charities (as well as non-Jewish charities), so for him to do a Christmas album is a bit weird.  I have all his old stuff and just watched a great video of \\"Jokerman\\" this morning.  Bottom line however, is that his aged, raspy voice has become tough to listen to.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|Please note that this is on the movie which I saw on HBO a few days ago, not on the DVD transfer, so I can't speak to the quality of that.<br /><br />I would like to make a few comments on the video and animation, though. I just saw the movie again for the first time since it came out, and I have to say it still holds up very well from the standpoint of the special effects and animation. Certainly, the CGI effects are better today, but for the time this was state of the art.<br /><br />The dinosaurs are realistically rendered, and movement is very fluid and realistic also. One difference between then and now is that high level optical effects still weren't very highly developed, such as the ability to render certain kinds of reflections, such as those involving chromatic aberration and specular highlights, and the ray-tracing programs were not as technically capable. But overall this is still an impressive movie from the standpoint of the special effects.<br /><br />The dinosaurs were seamlessly inserted into the Jurassic backgrounds with the humans, and the movie benefited from the revolution in dinosaur theory that began back in the 70s with the new ideas about dinosaurs being much more agile and faster and possibly even warm blooded. The paleontologist, played by Sam Neill, even suggests that they had the ability to communicate through calls like birds and mammals. Today, it is thought that mammals like foxes, not just primates, have as many as 50 distinct calls.<br /><br />As to the other things like the acting, it was fine but let's face it, the dinosaurs were the real stars here and I think they upstaged the more advanced mammals in the flick, and my vote goes to them for their performance. :-)  But I have always liked actor Sam Neill and this might be his most famous role as the enthusiastic and intrepid dinosaur expert. And Mr. Attenborough is always good in whatever he does.<br /><br />Overall still a great adventure classic that still holds up well today.<br /><br />By the way, if you like animated flicks, I have to put in a plug here for the movie, \\"The Battle for Terra.\\" It's an independently produced fully animated movie that didn't receive wide distribution, since it was done by Hollywood outsiders. But it's a beautiful and visually appealing movie about a war between a peaceful race and warlike humans who attack their planet. If you compare it with say, \\"Titan A.E.\\" from almost ten years ago, you can see how much the animation technology has changed in that time. \\"Titan A.E.,\\" although great for its time, looked more like an animated cartoon. This movie looks like they're shooting actual 3D models, the figures and sets are so realistic and lifelike. It's a totally different world, literally.<br /><br />Even technically difficult lighting effects such as simple and complex reflection and refraction such as specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world-class painters have trouble rendering (Vermeer and van Eyck are two of the greats who could do this well). As if this wasn't enough, at the very end of the movie, amazingly, some erudite visual jokester inserted chromatic distortions that look like the internal reflections typical of compound optical lenses, which various high-tech optical coatings are designed to minimize, as if the movie was shot with a real film camera. Too funny.<br /><br />So if you're into CGI stuff I can recommend this movie also.cks, I have to put in a plug here for the movie, \\"The Battle for Terra.\\" It's an independently produced fully animated movie that didn't receive wide distribution, since it was done by Hollywood outsiders.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|This movie is way out there... Not sure where they were trying to go with this movie but, I really can't wait till Arnold is no longer playing Governator and gets back to create another actual movie and this one is redone.  I was looking to see Terminators such as Arnold, the T-1's (from the original movie,) Summer Glau, and Kristianna Loken's characters in it or at least similarities to them, there wasn't.  Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold, even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character.<br /><br />Outside of these nuances, the overall movie was good, just not a James Cameron movie and it shows.

B00284BNKC|5.0|This outstanding piece of art should be seen by every teen thinking of escaping into some placating world away from a disturbing environment they call reality. I wish I had when I was younger. Do not try to figure out what to expect, do not dissect every frame with pompous imaginings like some viewers and commenters like MauricioD. He seems to be obsessed with his definition of surrealism. I'm sure Aronofsky didn't look in a dictionary to mold his movie or to be weighed down by a definition. Surreal is in the eyes of the beholder. Just sit back and be mesmerized by a well-woven story with a powerful message. It will blow you away! It's worth 3 times the price. I recently purchased a second copy to give to my 15-yr old nephew, and we will sit down and have a long talk afterwards.
0307473708|5.0|It took me a while to read the Dexter series of books because I had been a longtime fan of the series and I was afraid of what I might find here. I personally couldn't imagine a different Dexter and i thought there might be a different person described in the book that would ruin something for me. Waiting so long - that really was a mistake. When I sat down with the first Dexter book, I recognized the characters immediately. What's more, I understood some things that I really hadn't taken the time to recognize before. The shirts the detectives/ forensic personages wear, for example, really didn't strike me as odd until I saw the \\"why\\" that was described here. I also never thought of the way Maimi cleaned up a crime scene and made it look like something like Dahmerland - by Disney! - until I read the book. Even phrases Dexter mutters in his mind are in both places, completing a character that I have grown to love over the last 4 seasons.<br />If anything, the book allows a complete picture of Dexter to flourish.<br /><br />In the show, Dexter has flahses that he shares with the audience and, in the book, he has thoughts that describe his mindset. The two are the same in a lot of ways, only Dexter in the book shows some details that add to the way I see him. Combine that with the show and you have a superb look at a great writer and a great script that allowed Dexter to be born. This book took me a day to read and another to read again for comparison, and I was surprised by how much I had known but that could be pointed out to me. There are bit players in the series I had never known by name, but now that I see them I understand them and the little things that make them unique. Couple that with our Debs and out detective/forensic squads and you have somethint aht is creative, that flows well, and that had a hook that I can only described as addictive.<br /><br />Since I do not want to ruin the book or the series for people who have not read it, I will say that the descriptions of Dexter are right in some ways but off in others. In places i have seen him described as an emotionless man (he even adds that), but he is far from that. He has complexities that make you like him, a sense of humor that runs dark enough to make you find him interesting, and a past that makes you want to keep learning more. In the series of episodes, I have 4 seasons that are still giving me more, and the books (I'm on the 4th now) also do that. That keep on giving me complex pictures of a man who has a code and a dark passenger riding shotgun with him, and that makes things very interesting. Even the beginning of both sets, the childkiller and how it sets up, both show you the same thing and yet - and yet they give you little pieces of a puzzle that are uniquely their own. This should make this reading a must for fans and nice read for people thinking about getting into the character, because the book provides many latyers along many lines that even make smaller pieces interesting to see as they develop. Decide what you want to see fgirst, however, because one will give away answers to the other and, well, you can't have it both ways.<br />you simply should try it on in both directions to see how you love the packaging.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how much I was wrong to wait. Sorry Dexter. I'm glad you don't collect slides just because a person likes to put things off. Also, do not forget the other books that have come out because the on-going era of Dexter is a great thing to watch.<br />If only I had a bowling shirt like his now, i would feel rather good on this Halloween night.are right in some ways but off in others.

B002MW50KO|4.0|Let's keep this succinct: This is nearly excellent.  Bob's singing in Bob's voice, so if that's the complaint, you'll have it for every album he does.  If Bob Dylan's voice is a problem, don't buy the albums.    What makes this less than excellent for me is one small verse in O Come All Ye Faithful.  The first verse, attempted in Latin, just doesn't get anywhere.  It's as if the song doesn't start until Bob switches to English.  And coming in the middle of the album, it's somewhat hard to skip over that rough bit.  So I'll bear it, knowing now that it does get better.  Bob's an optimist at heart, always was, and the subtle and not-so-subtle lyric changes in these classic holiday songs reflect the hope of the season and the hope in his heart.    This is going to be played every holiday here for years to come.  Four stars!
9113020730|5.0|A young girl lies in a hospital room, her tattooed body very close to death -- there is a bullet lodged in her brain. Several rooms away is the man who tried to kill her, his own body grievously wounded from axe blows inflicted by the girl he has tried to kill. She is Lisbeth Salander, computer hacker and investigator, and the man is her father, a murderous Russian gangster. If Salander recovers from her injuries, she is more than likely to be put on trial for three murders -- the authorities regard her as a dangerous individual. But she won't see the inside of a courtroom if her father manages to kill her first.<br /><br />This is the high-tension opening premise of the third book in Stieg Larsson's phenomenally successful trilogy of crime novels which the late author (a crusading journalist) delivered to his publisher just before his death.<br /><br />[[ASIN:9113020730 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (Millennium Trilogy, 3)]]
0965773604|5.0|What can you say about Harper Lee's bittersweet tale of growing up in the deep south? That it's the perfect story told in a manner that is thoughtful, insightful and heartbreaking in its examinations of the lives of three children who live in this town and tale.<br /><br />  Harper Lee has taken the times and places of her childhood and woven them into a tale that transcends both time and place. The lessons, foibles and fables of the story have, over time, come to symbolize the struggles of all people who are striving to make themselves better and are bravely facing fear and hatred.<br /><br />  This is a book that will change the mindset of most thinking persons. If you do not come away from this book with some thought as to what is bravery and what is the cost of that bravery then you need to go back and reread this incredible book.<br /><br />  I know that it changes my life and mind each time I read it. It reminds me, as it should remind us all, that life is precious, people are people, and we all are basically the same if we allow ourselves to be and we should revel in those differences!!!
B000UR9T82|5.0|In this first movie of the Spider-Man franchise (2002) director Sam Raimi did almost everything right. He concentrated on character development and character growth. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker becomes a fully-realized person before our eyes. He's not a cardboard or cartoon character hero. He's vulnerable, innocent, a wide-eyed likeable person that we can empathize with. Orphaned, he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) in a very modest Queens(?) home. He has a lifelong crush on the girl next door Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).<br /> Bitten by a spider, he gets great powers that he uses to fight evil. Fighting the bad guys becomes a mission more important than his personal happiness and his love for Mary Jane. His wealthy friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) has a father Norm (Willem Dafoe) who because of an experiment gone awry becomes a nut case villain, the Green Goblin, who buzzes around on a flying machine like a sled. The two masked men, Spider and Goblin, go after each other and all heck breaks loose.<br />The subsidiary characters are well-done including J.K. Simmons as Peter's editor who thinks Spider-Man is a menace. Uncle Ben is instrumental in carving out a career for Spider-Man/Peter.<br />Spectacular scenes of Spider aloft weaving in and out through the Manhattan canyons are memorable along with the Roosevelt tram episode.<br />This movie surmounts its action-oriented genre, and creates believable people. Toby's acting is a key to the movie's success and its artistry. Enough teasers and unfinished business was left in this one to spawn sequels and perhaps even a Broadway musical.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This CD was even better than I expected it to be!  His voice was made for this type of music.  It is exciting to hear an artist stretch and grow into an area that may be a risk, but in my estimation, this risk has well paid off for the listener.  This will become one of those CDS that I will keep as my top ten of all time CDs.  I think once you free yourself from the idea this CD should be like every other Sting CD and let yourself be carried away by the time and the \\"mind stories\\" the songs take you on, you will be in for one wonderful journey!  Thank you Sting!

In \\"Ark Angel\\", Alex Rider is recovering from a bullet shot that nearly hit his heart. He encounters the son of... let's just say a rich father. Alex saves the boy's life, and he automatically receives an award for his deed - staying at the castle of the rich father. This millionaire has launched Ark Angel, the first ever hotel in space. But what if his intentions aren't all they turn out to be?  Our fourteen-year-old spy is back for another thrilling adventure.

B001KVZ6G6|1.0|If the package came with a 3D version I would by it, very eagerly, but this is a complete waste to me. I'll rent it when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray in Australia and then I will wait for a 3D version, but if it does come out in 3D and it is not packaged with the extras included here, them I will never buy it. So frustrating and so disappointing.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Bublé\\"s new cd Crazy Love is a CD for all ages.  It is a easy listening cd with a kick.  Michael sings like a dove with just enough ruff to make it exciting. Cry Me A River has just enough anger to make you believe that he lost his love and now it is too late and it is time for her to pay the price.  It is a great song and is making news all over the place.  Haven't met you yet is just the song for the young people that have not found that one yet that they expect to  spend the rest of their lives with.  It is a cute pick me up song that is enjoyble for all.  Baby you got what it takes is the kicker, I did not expect this one and was amazed at how wonderful it was, it was a good out of the box song that all will get a kick out of.  The young lady Ms Jones can sing, and Michael can hold his own with her,  he has just enough ruff to make this  a favorite.  This is a great cd for whatever reason a gift, a party but I would buy it for yourself and keep if for yourself, I listen to it all the time and I am sure you will too.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|\\"Love is fearless\\". That's a profound philosophical principal few people have even heard of and fewer still understand, yet through personal experience and artistic intuition, Taylor Swift has grasped it. Her songs follow that theme with utmost consistency, that only comes from intense focus. She appeals to the young and the young at heart, because they still remember what it's like to be in love.    She takes the role of the underdog, compassionate with everyone's suffering, because she's gone through it, been an outcast, she gives hope and inspiration, that the underdog can eventually triumph, if your love is strong enough. It's evident in her songs and video blogs how she loves her family, her band, friends and fans. The ugly duckling with bad hair turns into a fairy tale princess, a rock star goddess, and finds true love. Truly inspiring.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE was the album that forever changed my taste in music. I was not a U2 fan before this album was released; I didn't dislike their previous music but it never inspired me to buy one of their albums. But when my college roommate first played this album in 1984 it struck me like a lightning bolt, or a revelation. It was haunting, beautiful, soaring music, like nothing I had ever heard before. It instantly transformed me into a lifelong U2 fan.<br /><br />After the WAR album, U2 felt that they had reached the creative limit of their post-punk sound, so they decided to explore new musical territory. This was the riskiest move they had made in their career to that point. The safe move would have been to release WAR Part II rather than to risk alienating their growing fan base with an experimental album. But they felt that they had more artistic potential than post-punk would allow, so they sought to expand their sonic palette. With the help of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, they were able to shed their prior musical influences and explore uncharted territory. They all achieved new levels of musicianship on this album. The Edge developed more complex, layered guitar work, Adam and Larry developed more sophisticated rhythms, and Bono's vocals soared to heights they had never reached before. To me, this album represents U2 in their purest form, unencumbered by other musical influences and discovering their own unique sound. After this album they began assimilating American musical influences, and in the 1990s they moved on to assimilate Europop. All of these phases led to some great music, but their sound was never quite as original or unique as it was during the UF era.<br /><br />My anticipation went through the roof when I first heard that U2 would be releasing a super deluxe package of UF with a remastered CD, a bonus audio CD and a DVD. High expectations are usually a prescription for disappointment, but in this case I found that the final product actually exceeded my expectations. The album itself has never sounded better, and the bonus CD is phenomenal, in my opinion the best one that they've put together so far. Packed with 16 tracks (69 minutes of music), it has every track from the Wide Awake in America EP (including my all-time favorite U2 track, their incredible live version of \\"Bad\\"), all of the hard-to-find B-sides from their \\"Pride\\" and Unforgettable Fire\\" singles, and best of all, 4 previously unreleased tracks (2 original songs and 2 remixes). All of the previously unreleased tracks are great. \\"Disappearing Act\\" (a former instrumental track to which they recently added vocals) is an epic U2 song which is more inspired than most of their recent work, and \\"Yoshino Blossom\\" is one of their best instrumental tracks. The 2 never before released remixes of \\"Wire\\" (Kervorkian remix) and \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" (Daniel Lanois remix) are also inspired, particularly the latter, which features background vocals by Peter Gabriel. You know it's a great song when a band can record 3 radically different versions and they all sound great. The DVD has all of the music videos derived from this album, the \\"Making of UF\\" documentary, and best of all, great concert footage from their Live Aid and Conspiracy of Hope concerts. The Live Aid performance (with their phenomenal 12 minute rendition of \\"Bad\\") was the one that changed their status forever, showing the world that they were superstars. After this concert everyone knew who Bono was. My only quibble is that it would have been nice to see live versions of \\"Wire\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", but that's a minor quibble. Overall, this package is a dream come true.<br /><br />If you liked the original UF album, I would recommend that you at least buy the deluxe package with the remastered album plus the bonus CD, as the latter has some inspired tracks. This was one of their most creative periods, and it's the first time that all of the musical ideas from this phase of their career have been made available. But if you are a big fan of this album, then I would suggest you splurge and get the super deluxe package with the bonus DVD. It's definitely worth it.available.

B002NACY2M|5.0|The first time I listened to this album I was mildly disappointed..perhaps I should have been sitting quietly and not at all distracted because that's how this work is meant to be heard. The second time around, Sting has once again drawn me in. \\"Christmas at Sea\\" is reminiscent of his work in \\"Soul Cages\\" and is a favorite. This really is a soundtrack for winter with Christmas highlights that totally distance themselves from the same old offerings. There is a darkness to some of the compositions that match the quietude of the long winter.  There is also some lighthearted works filled with the true Christmas spirit. This album is not for your holiday party...it's for quiet gatherings or solitary reflection. It weaves a magic spell and is rapidly becoming a favorite.
0802798225|4.0|this book took me 9 hours to finish. it was that good. its the kind of book where when your done your all pumped up and in a fun mood but its short lived because you realize its not really your life, and you wish so much that it was. I recommend it to those of you who are i need of something more than just a stupid book to fill the time. I thought this book was entertaining, and had a good meaning. it wasn't a profound meaning that will change your life, but its a fun read. Theres a little action, a lotta romance, some stereotypes, and some jokes. check it out.
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|One word: Awesome!<br /><br />As a big fan of late 90s and early 2000s pop punk and a minor fan of east coast hardcore, I have to say that this band is the perfect combination of the two.  The songs are extremely catchy and the songs are fun and aggressive at the same time.  I say this is A-OK<br />Thirty thumbs up!
B002H3F7F6|3.0|One thing is that as fans, we can be very demanding and self-ish.  When you think of Sting, think of a Professor of his art.  He is not your traditional musician who sticks to the same formula.  The best suggestion is that when you listen to this album, you should think of it as music by a Professor of his art, not just STING the legendary Rock musician. The best way to listen to this album is on your IPODS or headset. Listen to the album a few times, and it will grow on you. I have to admit, you might not like the whole album, but you might enjoy a few tracks during the cold days of winter: when you are sipping some tea or coffee, or drinking some Cognac, or just simply unwinding the stressful day.    I have started to like songs like \\"SOUL CAKE\\" which could become a sleeper hit during the Winter season.  I have downloaded the 1st 3 tracks, and i might download 2 or more songs from the album.  This type of music is not my cup of tea, but STING as always taken me to new musical journey, and i will continue to support him.      In today's music, you don't have that many musicians who can explore different boundaries of music, but Sting is an exception to the rule.  So, as music fans, and STING fans, we should respect what he is trying to accomplish.    The good news is that STING will be recording a new POP/ROCK album sometimes in 2010.
B002UJIY7A|1.0|I actually paid to watch this stupid film in theatres and after watching it, I was like, WOW, what a ****ing waste of almost two hours!! I own a lot of DVDs, but I wouldn't even keep this turd if someone gave me the DVD for free. I enjoy Timothy, Steve and Milla, but this was just out and out hilariously stupid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book starts ou a little slow, but once the action starts, it just keeps on coming. The characters are well-developed and interesting. The story is original and very capturing. I have read this book at least 5 times and I know I'm not going to stop anytime soon! Amazing book!
B0010X745K|2.0|The Mist is another example of extraordinary special effects talent mismatched with horrid direction and writing. Were it not for special effects one would think one was having an out-of-joint conversation with a schizophrenic. The truly ponderable thing about this movie is how a ninth-grade film class, apparently, came by the big money to produce it.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The blu-ray version of this movie looks amazing. I saw the DVD version and they must have done a crappy job on purpose on the DVD because the effects look awful on the DVD.
0783240236|2.0|Hitchcock made some good films, such as North by Northwest. But The Birds was not one of them (nor Psycho). Direction and writing are nigh nonexistent. Was Hitchcock on tranquilizers while doing this film? If not for the special effects crew this film would be wretched, as is sometimes the case in Hollywood (such as The Mist, another example of extraordinary special effects talent mismatched with horrid direction and writing). I know, saying Hitchcock made bad films is like saying Michelangelo couldn't sculpt or Shakespeare couldn't write. But that simply isn't the case.<br />The Birds is a drunken flop in all but special effects.
1596912863|5.0|I bought this on a lark, thinking of it as a diversion. I was surprised to find that the concept is well thought out and the characters quite engaging. This book pokes fun at and embraces Austen-mania at the same time. For a real treat, try the audiobook, as the reader does an excellent job with the voices and accents. Buy it, read it (or listen to it) and have fun!

B000QUCNOK|5.0|\\"Perfume\\" is an absolutely stunning movie.  It grabs the viewer from the first moment when a baby is apparently stillborn under the table of a fishmonger's stall amidst garbage and fish innards, in one of the slimiest parts of Paris. But the baby fights to live and live he does despite his desperate beginning and childhood.    Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is shunned by everyone: his social interactions are abnormal and he cannot relate emotionally with anyone, except to protect himself.  However, he does possess an extraordinary skill: his sense of smell.  He can smell things that other humans do not believe have any smell at all, e.g. glass, copper, stone etc. His goal in life becomes how to capture the essence of smells, particularly those of the human soul.    This quest leads him to develop methods of preserving human essences, but in order to retrieve them, he has to kill the people whose essences he desires.  They are all beautiful young women.    The story starts as a \\"true\\" tale told in flashback and  it seems totally believable, even though it is fiction.  The filmmakers also generate an atmosphere that makes you think you smell what he is smelling too--an amazing feat.     This is an exceptional film, not quite like anything else I have ever seen, except perhaps \\"Sweeny Todd\\".  This is far superior and is spectacular on every level.  The ending is grisly but so are the crimes he commits. This is a one-of-a-kind experience and highly recommended.
B001S86J1C|4.0|I am very selectively upgrading my movie collection to Blu and, to me, at this price, buying Bueller again was a no brainer. However, not everyone may be happy with what the Blu edition has to offer so, let's discuss it.<br /><br />The Blu treatment of the the picture makes it slightly better than the DVD edition but only slightly - nothing like the older James Bonds or the 2001 on Blu. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 probably is a more significant improvement than the upgraded image. It it convincingly superior to the DVD edition. In addition, there are Dolby 2.0 soundtracks in French and Spanish and subtitles are available if needed.<br /><br />When it comes to bonus features, this edition actually lacks the director's commentary soundtrack - don't understand why. The 'extras' seem to be those found on the previous DVD release:<br /><br />- Getting the class together - cast members talk about their experience<br />- The making of... - everybody gets to talk<br />- Who is Ferris Bueller - more analysis<br />- The world according to Ben Stein - Ben is himself, again<br />- Vintage Ferris Bueller, the lost tape - very funny actually, includes a very young Matthew Broderick interviewing the other cast members<br />- Class Album - a collection of stills<br /><br />With the exception of the Class Album photos which got the HD treatment, all other bonus features were shot in low-def and narrow screen (also known as 'full screen').<br /><br />I would say that this should be a definite buy for a 'first time' Ferris Bueller enthusiast. For those who already have the movie on DVD... I don't regret making the purchase but the buying decision should be made with the awareness that this is not a giant leap forward in quality or viewing experience. It's good, it's better than the DVD but not by a lot.
B000MV9026|4.0|If you have been living in a cave and haven't seen this DVD have no fear. Good family fun.
1416594787|3.0|A decent enough book, but not really a keeper.  \\"Why Evolution is True\\" by Jerry A. Coyne is much more concise and powerful.
B0000524CY|5.0|Well, considering it's Halloween night and this is the last of my \\"31 Reviews For 31 Days of October\\" review-fest, I figure I'll end this countdown with one of the absolute most well-known horror movies of all time, and certainly one of the most horrifying, \\"The Exorcist\\". Although many quotes, stunts and ideas from this movies have been taken and parodied (\\"The power of Christ compels!\\" comes to mind.), this movie nevertheless has the power and terror that basically defines the horror movie genre.    Watching \\"The Exorcist\\" all the way through is more like an experience than watching a movie. For one thing, the general idea of the movie is a plausible concept, and having been to a paranormal speaker just last night, who ironically spoke of and showed a video of an exorcism for which she witnessed, this sort of thing is not entirely impossible, although it almost never happens. I don't want to dwindle on this part too much, but also regarding that I'm Roman Catholic, this movie definitely hits home with me.    But back to the movie itself. It kicks off with a scene that takes place in Egypt if I'm not mistaken, on an excavation dig with the foreign scenery setting a mood and atmosphere that carries throughout the whole movie. Starting the movie like this is an interesting idea, and a concept that hasn't been done too much by other movies, even though it works here. The acting throughout is phenomenal, alongside the special effects, which goes without saying. The whole movie plays out like a terrifying, dark, atmospheric nightmare and never loses its intensity or interest, even in the slower moments. I must say, even though I personally sometimes find it tedious to sit through a movie that goes over two hours long, I think \\"The Exorcist\\" definitely has the hudspah (spelling?) to make it pull you in for the whole thing. As dark and terrifying as this movie is, it most certainly still packs a brilliance, alongside talented writing and directing that makes it worth thewatch.    In short, \\"The Exorcist\\" is a film that's just as horrifying as it is both groundbreaking and vastly interesting. Such a movie deserves to go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and considering I'm a guy who's seen countless horror movies, I agree with that statement. Well, the review's about up, but for those that haven't seen such a heart-pounding, groundbreaking, interest-stirring movie yet, this is very highly recommended. And before you sleep, say some prayers just for safety!!! Happy Halloween, everybody, I'm off to smother myself in Halloween candies, household props and going around all evening in my pajama pants. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I watched the \\"This is it\\" movie yesterday and i can't express how it made me happy and thrilled cause i knew this person i watched dancing, singing, mentoring is the real MJ.And not that person that the media pictured as a molester and abnormal man, heart aching though..........MJ left us all,what a huge loss.  What you will see is a miracle, a man in his 50s outperforming everyone and same time a great teamwork player.His love,respect and patience for the people around him is very obvious and mutual.  I am praying to god everyday that MJ would be some where better, i will always love you.
0307473708|5.0|I got sucked into watching all the Dexter seasons (now following the fourth season on Showtime) in the last few months and I needed more Dexter once I was done, so I picked this book up at the local Target for $5.  There are of course many similarities to the show, but the books do a much better job at really capturing Dexter's personality and inner thoughts.  Things that were subtly hinted at in the show come into much sharper focus in the book (such as LaGuerta's apparent crush on Dexter and his obvious discomfort), and the reader gains more insight into how Dexter ticks.  The most enjoyable part of this book is that Dexter's wonderfully macabre sense of humor really gets a chance to shine.  The plot doesn't run parallel to the show by any means, so it's more like an alternate adventure for Dexter.  If you love the show and you love sarcastic wit, you will love this book.
B002HWUU2C|4.0|Looks like Amazon has fixed the mistake on the track list of the bonus CD.  Now shows 14 songs, not 20.   Anyone who purchased it when the 20 was listed may want to call customer service and request credit to buy mp3s.  I got a credit for 6 songs and was able to buy all but Blue Shoes in mp3 form.
6305075492|5.0|isnt the image entertainment version dubbed in english though? and the kino version contains the original german soundtrack? could you please tell me if im correct? I want to buy the movie, but I want to watch it in its orginal german form, not a stupid english dubbed edition.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Good condition, got here fast, and the quality was great. I would definately buy from this retailer again.
B002DKGWSE|2.0|I really thought this was going to be something amazing based on the trailer.  I wasn't a big fan of the original, but this looked interesting. I like a lot of the new remakes that have bee coming out.<br /><br />This is a well made film. And I appreciate that a lot of the original cheese was removed.  The rape scene was appalling and unless I just supressed the memory of the first film, it's much worse.  Given the horror of what Mary endures, I didn't feel like the kill/revenge scenes were as satisfying as the original. I felt the parents often bumbled around and made a lot of clich&eacute; horror movie mistakes.  It's definitely an intense movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat, but I also heard myself screamng \\"OH COME ON!\\" an awful lot.<br /><br />If anyone is interested, the Italian film, Night Train Murders (1975) was a much better rip-off of Last House on the Left.
B0007OCG56|5.0|Good condition, got here fast, and the quality was great. I would definately buy from this retailer again.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I am a huge Lady Gaga fan. The Fame, her first release, is awesome. It's filled with pumping dance tracks with her great vocals over the top. The songs are fun and entertaining. It's great dance music, but also fun to listen and sing along.
B0017CW5J4|3.0|i had heard from a co-worker that he attended a show from this tour . he said it was expensive and he really enjoyed it . i think a form of mass hysteria is occuring here . i really enjoyed several songs . i liked the vocals by both the man and woman singers a good deal . i was expecting more from the blue men themselves . i could have writen some additional compelling things for the three men to do . i think most people could . they've certainly got an interesting take and some good and fun gags . the main drummer for the band was quite good . i liked the song lyrics a good deal . visually the show was very fun . i feel the show had a PG (church congregation) vibe pervading it . i felt it was a poor idea to appropriate PINK FLOYD'S music and THE WHO'S music and not make these takes special or unique . i found the film curiously mediocre . i liked the blue man adds on television back when i used to watch it (some years ago now) . more power to the fellas . they clearly pack the crowds in . i guess i thought the blue men would be more challenging . i thought they'd have a lot more in their arsenal (even in one 75 minute show) . i'd recommend as a library rental to fans of performance art .
1416594787|5.0|Because I've read almost all of Dawkins' other books, I thought that I would have nothing new to learn from this one and I originally obtained it just to flip through the pages and look at the marvelous photos.  But after a brief perusal, I became hooked and read the entire book in 4 long sittings.  My review will not discuss the book in great depth, because others have already done that.  Besides, wouldn't your time be better spent reading the book, not summaries of the book?     One of the things that I like about Dawkins' writing style is the clarity of his explanations.  He goes to great lengths to make his points very clear, as if he anticipates every question that a reader might ask, as if he were speaking with them directly.  This is the hallmark of a great science teacher.  Dawkins is also a lover of poetry, history and literature, and this book, like all his others, is sprinkled liberally with analogies from world history and quotes from Shakespeare, Keats, Browning and whomever else has said something relevant to the discussion  His footnotes are not to be skipped, as they contain some of the best writing and elucidations in the book.  The witty verse about the double brain that some dinosaurs had, in the footnote on page 306, is a good example of this (I memorized it).  The drawings, graphs and photographs are generous, though I thought that the index could have been deeper, as I often had to thumb through the book looking for where he made mention of a particular animal species.  He also directs the reader to many outside resources such as the \\"starlings at Otmoor\\" video on YouTube and the Tree Of Life that can be downloaded from the University Of Texas website.  Dawkins, is of course, a zoologist and the reader will learn a lot about fascinating animal behavior such as that displayed by the Ichneumon wasp and the Euglossine bee.  Did you know that the hooves of a horse are homologous to the middle toes on your feet and the middle fingers of your hands and that the bones in the wings of a bat are homologous to the bones in your hands?   Interesting stuff.    The final chapter, where he dissects and discusses, in minute detail, the last paragraph in the 1st edition of Darwin's Origin of Species, is a must-read; a brilliant piece of writing.  For instance, part of that final paragraph said \\"having been originally breathed\\" in the 1st edition of Origin of Species, whereas, in subsequent editions it read \\"having been originally breathed by the Creator\\".  Dawkins examines the reason for this and takes 5 pages to do so (but I wasn't bored one bit)!!  The short answer, by the way, that Darwin added \\"the Creator\\", as well as other quasi-religious words to editions 2-6, was due to extreme public pressure.      The reviews that are less than four stars were obviously given by people who didn't actually read the book, most of which probably are creationists who would find a science book difficult to endure.  They no doubt heard about The Greatest Show On Earth on Converapedia ( written by a right wing, anti-gay, anti-black, anti-gun control, misogynist group) or some other hate-mongering online publication, and then went over to Amazon to make sure that the book didn't get the 5 star average rating that it deserves.  Their trivial comments clearly show this and most never say anything specific about the book. I don't see how Dawkins can contain his frustration when he talks directly with people like Wendy Wright, \\"President Of Concerned Women For America\\"; part of his interview with Wright is reproduced in this book.  I'm sure that Wright has at least an average IQ, but she came across as very dense with no intention of changing her creationist point-of-view.  Dawkins kept trying to tell her that the fossil evidence for evolution was in museums all over the world but she kept asking for hard evidence as if she didn't hear a word that he said!!  This went on for several pages and Dawkins must have felt that he was trapped in some sort of \\"Groundhog Day\\" scenario.  I've had similar discussions with creationists and I think that after a certain age is reached, it is impossible to educate them.  Thinking scientifically has no benefit for them other than learning the truth about the natural world, whereas, religion acts as an interpreter of threats and promises conveyed from a supernatural world.  Fantasy is apparently more alluring than reality.    In this book, Dawkins continues to amaze me by his dogged, indefatigable attempt to make creationists see the rationality of  the information that science has mined in the almost century and a half since Origin of Species was first published.  He continues to try to explain evolution to creationists because he seems to believe that deep down inside, every human being is as rational as himself.  He's like a court room lawyer, who believes so much in his underdog client, that despite an obviously biased jury, if he explains things in just the right manner, then they will eventually  see the light, put their preconceived ideas aside, and he will win his case.  Only, for some reason, the attorney doesn't understand that the jury is deaf, dumb and blind and will never see the evidence that is so carefully presented to them.  So Dawkins, the eternal optimist, continues his quest to convert a world filled with billions of creationists.  On one hand, I admire his stalwart nature, but on the other hand, I believe that 99.99% of his readership doesn't need convincing.  As I already said above, once people reach a certain age, most are \\"fixed\\" for life.  They will never abandon their long-cherished beliefs because the ramifications are just too great.  The ostracism by family and friends will be too much for them to bear, even if, and that's a big \\"if\\", they chose even to entertain the thought.  The scientific ideas advanced by Dawkins, Gould, et al can't compete with the low-cost immortality insurance that religion peddles, which includes the promise of agrand reunion with all of one's loved ones in heaven.  Reality is a bitter pill to swallow and most aren't having it.  The Appendix, where Dawkins discusses the shameful world statistics, that show that a large percentage of the world's population still believes in creationism and other biblical myths, is quite depressing.  The statistics also show that nothing has changed for the better in all the years that these statistics have been gathered and 40% of Americans still believe in the Noah's Ark myth--even more than decades ago.  So, things are not getting any better and the only way that they will is if Time Magazine was right when they ran a cover story a few years ago suggesting that maybe there is a God gene.  If that is so, we can hope that it mutates to something more benign.  Because that seems to be about the only way that sane individuals will ever get control of this country or any other.     Though this book was written to explain why evolution is true, and should be read by creationists and young people who have not yet been brainwashed by our predominantly religious culture, in fact, it will (unfortunately) be read only by people such as myself who enjoy good science writing and are already \\"members of the choir\\".  In 40 years of being an atheist and a believer in evolution, I have never brought even one person over to my way of thinking and I doubt that Dawkins will fare much better.  But thank you, Mr. Dawkins for another great book, the reading of which has fine-tuned my knowledge of biology.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|DO NOT HESITATE!! BUY THIS DVD RIGHT THIS MINUTE!!  A RARE GLIMPSE OF TRUE GENIUS - HONEST AND UNFILTERED!!! DO IT!!! RIGHT NOW, DAMNIT!!!!!!
B000UZ4CWW|5.0|Slayer are back in the saddle once again with Christ Illusion, their first studio album since 2001's God Hates Us All. As we have come to expect from Slayer, lyrics include God, violence, and blood. Unlike God Hates, the sound of this recording is far more brutal. I think this makes the over all Slayer experience more satisfying. The return of Dave Lombardo on drums is very welcome by this fan, as his drumming is the sound of Slayer. Songs like \\"Flesh Storm\\", \\"Skeleton Christ\\" and \\"Catatonic\\" call to mind the heyday of Slayer in their prime. Tom Araya sounds as convincing as ever, \\"..I've seen the ways of God, I'll take the Devil any day\\" as he growls out lyrics as fast as King and Hanneman can riff, matching them with lightning fast bass playing. Awesome! My expectations were far exceded with this album, and it proves that Slayer are still the Gods of Thrash.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|After re-reading the book last month, I wanted to find a film that would capture the book in its best.  After reading lots of reviews of different versions, I checked this out from the library, and I'm so glad I did.  I actually watched it three days in a row, it is that good.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens depict Bronte's characters so well...even subtle facial features make Jane and Mr. Rochester come alive.  Although I often feel that watching a movie is never quite as good as reading the book, I felt like I was reliving the emotions of the book in watching this version.  The movie sticks very closely to the book, and I thought it was a great balance of time spent on Jane's childhood and her adulthood.  In my opinion, the film captures the inward turmoil and repressed passion of Jane and Mr. Rochester and tells their love story marvelously.  It is brilliantly cast and staged, and all together wonderful.  You must watch this...you will not be disapointed!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice in Chains has returned to the scene with Black Gives Way to Blue. Jerry Cantrell has found a true \\"replacement\\" for the late and great Layne Staley with William Duvall. Duvall and Cantrell harmonize beautifully, which is truly the signature sound of Alice. The songs on Black are reminiscent of Dirt, the last great AIC album: slow, cumbersome (in a good way!), thoughtful riffs, blending well with the harmonized, haunting vocals. \\"Your Decision\\", \\"A Looking in View\\", \\"Acid Bubble\\" and \\"Private Hell\\" are standout tracks. \\"Check My Brain\\", with its warped main riff call to mind the great ones from their first two albums, most notably \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"It Aint Like That\\". Great stuff! The title track, with it's piano accompaniment by none other than Elton John, gives a haunting insight into Cantrells friendship with Staley.Totally moving! Overall, Black Gives Way To Blue is a first rate album by the inventors of a genre, and should stand the test of time.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|A beautiful fantasy love story between a fallen star and a young lad who happened into a world of magic to retrieve a jewel for a woman he thought he loved all for the wrong reasons. Together they defeat a wicked king and four wicked witches and an evil prince to win a place among the stars to live happily ever after. The writer (Gaiman) of this comical love story was fortunate to attract a cast of talented actors and actresses to play the roles of the characters.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I would not have selected this movie on my own, and that would have been my loss.  On a flight going over to Europe it was the only one of the movies that was even passingly attractive, so I let it happen.<br /><br />This is a fine romantic comedy.  Sandra Bulluck is one of my favorite actresses and I end with some of the other moview I have really liked that feature her.<br /><br />In a nut-shell, she plays a boss clearly related to Satan, and while Ryan Reynolds is her hapless assistant who becomes valuable when she suddenly needs a husband.<br /><br />Betty White and Mary Steenburgen come into play at the very end of the movie.<br /><br />The movie surprises and delights.  At the end of it both of the two main characters have flipped in the most positive way possible, and I liked it.  Completely different from this, but also a romantic comedy with conflict, is [[ASIN:B002P413IC The Ugly Truth (Widescreen Edition)]] and further back in time but still great, [[ASIN:B00005NVDG He Said, She Said]]<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is not a name I recognize, he was world-class in this movie, and would appear to be ready to move up from the fraternity silly movie genre.<br /><br />Other films with Sandra Bullock I especially liked:<br />[[ASIN:0800141768 The Net]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008NRI7 Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000HEWEEE The Lake House (Full Screen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004UEDQ 28 Days (Special Edition)]]<br /><br />And of couirse there are others.
0060527986|3.0|I am a big Paublo Choelo fan, but this book disappointed me.  This one left me feeling flat and uninspired.  Maybe it's simply that I expected more.  For some, perhaps the pieces in this book may awaken \\"something\\".  I prefer sticking with his storytelling....and receiving much more magic and depth!  If you've read similar books (with small excerpts) by teachers like Eckart Tolle, etc., you will probably be disappointed in  \\"Warrior of The Light\\", as I was.  This book arrived from Amazon damaged in shipping, so luckily I was able to return it for a full refund.  Thanx Amazon!
1433503794|5.0|As I am sure most people will do, I researched the version I wanted long before making a purchase.  I am extremely happy with the ESV version, but this review is more about the physical look and feel of the book.  I love the look of the two-tone brown and the binding seems very strong.  Although most pages are full of study notes (which is why a person purchases a study Bible) there is still room for me to enter my own notes on the page.  Each page is thin, to accomodate a book of over 2700 pages, but the pages are strong enough to allow me to write in pencil, erase, and write again.  The pages do not tear as easily as other versions I have.  The printing and layout are beautiful.  I am very happy with my purchase and of course the online Bible software that comes with the purchase is a great plus...which I do use.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|They did it again! For me-for the sixth time they've delivered a masterpiece! . A lot of people don't like Rosenrot but I am not among them.   Spring, Benzin, Hilf Mir, Feuer und Wasser, Zerstoeren, Wo Bist Du... Come on, these are Rammstein classics! This band have never disappointed me for the last 13 years. They have never repeated themselves! And their new album is a resume of their  best! The vocals are better than ever (I listened to the first five albums again to compare) , their compositions - mature and diverse, the lyrics are as twisted as usual. I couldn't expect more! An instant classic! My favourites-           -Wiener Blut . I think it's crazier than Mein Teil. I Love the frantic heavy riffs and the lyrics  are so strong! Simple and gut wrenching! It's the Fritzl song. \\"Welcome to the the darkness, to the loneliness, to the the reality\\" This sums up the whole tragic story of the Austrian psycho.          -Rammlied. Great opener and an instant live anthem         -B********* Heavy and twisted        -Waldmann's Heil -heavy and melodic        -Liebe ist fur alle da-thrashy and heavy        -Mehr-fantasic emotional vocals and a lot of  heavy riffs        -Donaukinder and  Frueling in Paris-great powerful ballads        -Halt-heavy and paranoid.         -Pussy-I didn't ike it  very much at first, but now I think it's a great song. And the text is very sarcastic.        I think this album  cannot disappoint a Rammstein fan. Buy the deluxe edition with the extra tracks-three of them are excellent, the last two are versions of Roter Sand - not mind-blowing as the rest of the album.  I like more the album version.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Wonderful yet sad to watch. Most special moment for me was when he called out the names of his brothers one by one and then his mom and dad during the rehearsal of I'LL BE THERE.  It was like a premonition. He spoke special words and then faded out to black.  WOW!!! Kenny Ortega and his gang did a phenominal job!  Kudos to Kenny for his commitment and dedication to creating this moving tribute to Michael!!!!  (Ny only concern was for Paris, Prince and Blanket for what their emotions probably were watching the Thriller part. -- I hope someone talked to them about that after they saw it).  God bless Michael and rest in peace.<br />Thank you Michael.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I've seen this movie many times and I have to say it is very funny. I won't repeat everything people have said, but if you like comedy then this is a good one. It is really hilarious how oblivious Shawn is in the beginning of the movie to all the zombies around him. Very good movie.
B00164GDD2|5.0|25 years after its original theater release, the original Ghostbusters is still a fun movie to watch, especially for those of us who are New Yorkers.  Even though there is some grain, transfer quality is good for a 25-year-old film.  Great trip down memory lane for those who enjoy the movie as kids back in 1984.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have seen the movie 12 times since it was out on 10/27/09.  I loved it.  He looked skinny but healthy. I wish the movie would have been longer and that they would have shown us the costumes.  They are on display in London.  I hope they eventually come to L.A. or at least show them in this DVD that is supposed to have extra footage.  I can't wait until it comes out.  It makes me sad that he died and the fans won't get to see the final show.  It would definitely be a fantastic sight to see.  It just goes to show the world that no one can even come close to comparing to MJ's talent and performance ability.  He's a true genius. I cried at the end because I miss him so very much.  MJ will live on in all the minds of his loving fans.    My newspaper today, 12-4-09, said that the dvd was going to have several mini-docs and special features.  It also said that the Blu-ray was going to have two versions of the music videos \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and \\"Thriller\\".  I don't understand why they aren't going to include those on the regular dvd's.  I guess I will probably have to buy a Blu-ray player.
B001UREJWM|4.0|The Old Testament prophets preached a message of doom (judgement) against the Israelites for sinning and falling away from God's commandments, but the prophets offered hope of redemption if the Israelites turned from evil. Likewise, HEAVEN AND HELL dig deep into a prophetic space of doom, gloom, and judgement, but also create high notes (cracks of light) giving hope to souls chained in hell.
0061719544|5.0|Craig Ferguson is a very talented writer.  His description of his early school experience will break your heart.  It also explains why he left school at 16.  His early adventures in punk rock bands and show business are harrowing.  Thank God he survived long enough to get into Rehab. If you are a fan, this book will give you a greater understanding and appreciation of the man and his many talents.  I also recommend his novel \\"Between the Bridge and the River.\\"
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Just those words spoken @ his last major press conference.  Did Michael know?  He said, \\"This is it, y'all.  This IS the final curtain call.\\"  On the surface, we know he meant, no more touring, no more performing.  But prophetically speaking, did he know?  I have been fortunate, as a child, to have seen him and his brothers perform in Atlantic City, NJ's Steel Pier as the Jackson 5ive as well as been present for many of his concerts as a solo artist.   So I have to ask the question again, did Michael Jackson know?  Did he feel somehow that his work here was done and he was leaving us?  Because if what I witnessed last evening was simply 'rehearsal footage' then maybe we, who he left behind, would not have been able to absorb the final product for that concert is playing non-stop on a much greater stage than what we have down here.  That movie/rehearsal is a masterpiece and a most loving, fitting, testament to what happens when GOD touches and enhances a soul.  I don't believe \\"This Is It\\" was just 120 hours of rehearsal footage for his final concerts, I choose to believe, that Michael Jackson knew.  He was so far ahead of his time, of course he knew and what that movie was and is, is a love letter not only to his children, his family, his fans, friends but to everyone that his music touched and will continue to touch.  This is it to those of us who never had the chance to see him perform while he was here.  This is it to those that saved up and then waited in line to buy tickets to these sold out shows.  This is it to show how 300% goes not only for showtime but for everything leading up to it.  His songs transcended and his music coursed thru you.  Well, it did me.  I can't count how many times he said 'God Bless You' during the film.  I can still see that haunting smile he shone as Kenny Ortega, said 'fade to black' @ the end of the \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" spectacular.  Some will say that \\"This Is It\\" is the final chapter in the life of an extraordinarytalent and humanitarian.  It will be nominated, speculated, win many awards, break world records and then they will make a space on the shelf in the archives, wipe their hands, and be done with it.  Well, the party's not over, I choose to believe it's the start of a whole new book. For as long as there are folks like y'all and me who love this man, his music, what he stood for and tried to do, the rest is not silent and the final curtain has not fallen.  I love this man so very much and I'm fixin' to cry so, thanks, for reading.  Just my 3cents.
B0029O08WA|1.0|The only track on this album worth mentioning is the instrumental piece The Meadow, the rest of the tracks are just an eclectic mix of indie songs that are incredibly depressing and some, downright irritating.  Where is Paramore? Where is Mutemath?  Where is Blue Foundation?  Whoever decided to create a soundtrack without these musicians and  other fantastic contributors to the Twilight soundtrack should be ashamed.   Bring back Catherine Hardwicke, she is not only a wonderful and innovative director, she knew how to construct a soundtrack that not only added to the success of the Twilight movie, but also individually showcased the talented musicians in their own right.   Let's hope the New Moon movie is a huge improvement on it's soundtrack but from the trailers so far I am not very hopeful.  Stephanie Meyer did you really want the Twilight series to be remembered by substandard movies and boring soundtracks?
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|Isabelle Fuhrman gave an outstanding performance as The Orphan.  Vera Farmiga also did an excellent job.  The movie started off with a slow pace, and maybe should have ended a little before it did, but the storyline and directing were great. Loved the twist - really unexpected.  Best movie I've seen lately!
B0000524CY|5.0|It's really hard to name every single horror film that's ever been made. Many deal with zombies, ghosts, serial killers, classic monsters like Frankenstein, and mutated species. Some are classic, others are mediocre, and several are ridiculous and dull. Out of all of them, only a few have been recognized as the greatest in the genre. The Exorcist, Psycho, and The Shining have been rightfully praised for the terrors that they have conveyed. Dozens of others have never topped them ever since they were released. While my favorite horror film of all time is actually The Shining, I can perfectly understand why The Exorcist is considered the best. First of all, is has an unusual storyline (back in the 70's, at least). Instead of ghosts or zombies or werewolves, it's demon possession. The body of a young girl is being controlled by a spirit from Hell. With every medical analysis being inconclusive, the mother has one last chance of bringing her daughter back. She brings in Father Karras, who has a crisis of faith, and Father Merrin, who has seen this sort of prediction when he visited Iraq.<br /><br />So why is it that this is considered the scariest movie of all time. Well, the shock effects may be outdated to some, but it's the eerie atmosphere and the thought of being possessed that makes it truly horrifying. The silent, quick shots of the infamous \\"Captain Howdy\\" are also an addition to this ghoulish nightmare. You don't need loud and abrupt music or hardcore gore, all you need here is a creepy environment, a slow pace, and some fiendish dialogue from Regan/the demon. Mind you, there are some great modern horror films (such as Rec, The Evil Dead series, and the original Thai version of Shutter), but The Exorcist, The Shining, and Psycho are in top form when it comes to scaring the s*** out of you. The Exorcist, especially, is one that is truly scary because of its controversial subject matter. The finest, no doubt.<br /><br />Grade: A+
0547258305|4.0|I had this book on my wishlist for several months and I was really looking foward to reading it, but when I borrowed it from the library and read it, I took it off of my wishlist. It's a nice read, but it lacked for me. The main character is a strong role model for girls, but it didn't really have good depth for me. I don't recommend this book for late teenagers. I recommend it for pre-teen or early teenage girls.
B000NQPZCO|4.0|Many reviews here seem to be only about the movie, not about the specific edition on bluray, so I thought I add a few comments on it. I've seen \\"Donnie Brasco\\" some twenty-odd times, so I was excited to get it on bluray. My impression? Well, the technical quality is really great: the picture is very much better than on the very good regular dvd's for sale (and the sound too, I guess, but I use headphones so I don't really know). The \\"extended cut\\", however, was a bit of a disappointment (note: at approx. 145 minutes, this version contains far more extra scenes than earlier versions). Only one or two instances of added material really added something to the story or movie as a whole, to my mind: most of it actually detracted from my experience of the movie - and not only because I'm so habituated to the regular version, I think. Still, even so it's a great gangster and psychological drama, with great acting: but if you already have the \\"Special edition\\" with the director's commentary etc (not included in the meagre extras on this bluray edition), you might want to wait for a new bluray release with the original cut. Trust me, sometimes less is really more.    Addition: I noticed now the same \\"extended cut\\" is apparently available on regular dvd too, so if you've seen that one you know what the problem is - the additions don't really add anything, but only disturb the careful pace and rhythm of the original version (and there is way too much lion...)

1579128149|5.0|It all started the Christmas before last when a friend (yes, she trained as a chemist) gave me a print of the periodic table by this author. For each element there is a picture of a lump of the element, or something made from the element, or some other representation of the element. For the noble gases there are discharge lamps (colloquially called \\"neon\\" lights even when the gas isn't neon) in the shape of their chemical symbol. For hydrogen there is a photo of a nebula. For elements that have only been created in minute quantities there are other representations: for example, californium is represented by the seal  of the state of California, and einsteinium by a picture of Big Al himself. This print has been the subject of much comment in my office. (Yes, it is an engineering organization.) At the end of this book there is a perforated fold-out of a similar print.<br /><br />This book expands the concept by giving each element two facing pages of information and pictures. (A few special elements--copper, gold, iron, uranium--get an extra pair of pages.) In additional to a description of the element and its uses, basic information includes position on the periodic table, atomic weight, density, atomic radius, crystal structure, electron order filling, atomic emission spectrum, and state (solid, liquid, gas) vs temperature. Nice, but you can find that on the internet. What you want this book for is the pictures!<br /><br />And excellent pictures they are. For each element there are now roughly five to ten pictures; depending on the element there may be parts made from it, important minerals it is in, compounds it is part of, and even some odder uses. For europium you will find a compact fluorescent bulb, which has europium in its phosphor. Bismuth has a picture of a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. May favorite is plutonium, which has a picture of a bottle of homeopathic plutonium pills. The caption reads: \\"Homeopathic remedies are fraudulent products that contain none of their listed ingredients. In the case of these homeopathic plutonium pills that is a distinctly good thing.\\" (Plutonium is very poisonous.)<br /><br />A great book if you have in interest in what the world around us is made of. Or if you want to add a touch of highbrow sophistication to your coffee table book collection. It could also serve to get an older child interesting in chemistry.<br /><br />\\"It's elementary, my dear Watson,\\" buy this book! (Bad, but I couldn't resist.)edients.

B002UWJDB8|4.0|To me this series plays a lot less like Stargate, and a lot more like Battlestar Galactica. It seems actually quite purposefully designed that way. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that if you are a Galactica fan and I will admit I like that series. But that is not why I watch Stargate. I like Stargate for its solid ensemble, mission oriented approach to series television. Perhaps they are moving toward that, solidifying the ensemble, defining missions. But I hope they do a bit more of it soon. Right now it just feels like they don't have much of a direction.Note that I say \\"a direction\\". The actual acting and directing is superb so far, given the vehicle. I just don't want to see them still scrambling to stay alive two years down the road. And a true external villain soon, that would be nice. Teasing is a good way to start a series, but give us a bite before too much longer. At any rate I will continue to watch as long as there is a gate on the set.
0743497465|4.0|Anyone who has lived on earth long enough, and become educated well enough recognizes that not everything that occurs on earth is discernible, comprehensible, or visible, and therefore, books like Browns offer the self discipline to enable the reader to view events from a broader, and less forthright manner, to seek the missing pieces in what we see, hear, and experience to fill in the missing gaps, and therefore, not to prejudge anything - good or bad - until the reasons underlying them can be found.<br /><br />Demons are always in the details, and treasures are rarely out in the open.<br /><br />Enough reason to bother, and to heed the perspective of Brown in his attempt to make sense from what often appears senseless.
B001JE25ZE|5.0|I Am Legend is an amazing book! It's nothing like the Will Smith movie, but it's great in it's own way! It's different enough that someone who has seen the movie before reading the book, like me, can really appreiciate it. And it's not scary but exciting and keeps you reading. There is also a bunch of Richard Matheson's short stories after I Am Legend, so you definitely get your moneys worth with this book.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I grew up with Michael Jackson, so I was curious about how this movie would be created after his death.  Watching this pre-concert rehearsing was interesting and poignant.  One really got to know pieces of MJ through his musical behind-the scenes.  The concert could not be filmed, as it to take place eight days after all filming.  The videos were never meant to be public, as they were to be for Michael's personal files.  However, the splicing and sequenced practice sessions were brilliantly placed.  It was as complete as it could be.  Watching MJ displaying his musical brilliance and his warmth was worth the price of the ticket to the IMAX.  It was the best that it could be, and I do believe that Michael showed us much of himself in his rehearsing persona.  It was fabulous to see how the dancers, musicians and singers worked with Michael.  So personal.  So memorable. So brilliant.
0470449756|5.0|The shipping took about 10 days as it has been promised. So, they did their job.
0385504225|2.0|I was pretty captivated by the story (albeit same formula as his others) until the climax.  I don't understand why the climax was followed by pages and pages of blather.  The characters seemed to carry on as if they had not been traumatized with the threat of death during the last several hours.  I kept reading in hopes of another plot point or twist, but none came.  I think Mr. Brown's a bit self-serving to go on and on.  Ultimately, I would not recommend this book.  I had hoped for something more satisfying through to the end.
1591396190|5.0|Excellent book, with notable examples of companies which have implemented strategies that separate them from the competitive pack.  Recommend for anyone with responsibility for or input to strategic planning.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|As other reviewers point out, you don't need to know anything about the TV series that came before this movie.  In fact, this movie alerted us to the series and we watched all the reruns afterwards.<br /><br />This movie has superb effects, a great plot, plausible characters and excellent production values.<br /><br />They stay away from too much science, with the entertainment coming from the characters and plot, not a pseudo explanation of how they zip across space.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Prince music has always been in a category by itself.  Some cannot get it, which is understandable.  I get it and I like it.  I received the album in the mail today and listened to it for the first time and enjoyed it.  As I type this review I am replaying it.<br /><br />Among my favorites are Te Amo Carazon, Black Sweat, Incense and Candles, Love, Satisfied (which I heard him sing live on a show and is why I purchased the album), Fury, The Word, Beautiful Loved & Blessed, The Dance, and Get on the Boat.  I think I've named the entire album basically.<br /><br />His album takes you on a journey.  You have to listen to the album to understand and appreciate it. His lyrics are deep, meaningful and contain alot of power.  His lyrics are very inspirational in Beautiful Loved and Blessed.  He ended the album with Get on the Boat, which is very fitting.  This is an album worth going on a journey with and for.  I enjoyed the journey and I will go again soon.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|I have the WG \\"complete\\" series. So far, I'm into the 3rd season and loving every minute of it. I marked which disk each episode was on in the guide, and that's when I saw so many missing storylines. It turns out that none of the episodes was missing. I did not realize that in season 3 WG started having 2 menus. I was missing the last 3 episodes on each disk. I went back today and checked off each episode in the guide. They were all there. I still rank this as a 5-star performance set. This is exceptionally smart comedy and I recommend it anyone who really likes clever dialogue. Buy and enjoy.

6305428042|5.0|It is not Halloween until I have watched hocus pocus. I adore it and so do my little girls. Its a wonderful \\"spooky\\" family fun movie.
6305546789|4.0|The first Halloween to me has a special meaning to me in that it was probably the first Horror movie I remember seeing. We used to watch this and laugh and quote scenes, and it was indeed frightening also don't get me wrong...but it had such a sense of humor and such lovable characters, there was more to this than just a slasher film.<br /><br />Watching it as a grown up reveals so many flaws, we all know it was shot with a low budget by a young crew for the most part. Right from near the beginning when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is walking down the street you see trees that have green leaves on them all around, and then there's the mysterious rain that fell on Lauries block only apparently. Also Annie picks up Laurie at 6:30 p.m. when it's still pretty light outside, when in fact as I type this in Illinois it's only 6:15 p.m. and it's pretty dark outside. I am always hoping not to see a palm tree in the background, or the Hollywood Hills or something.  Too bad they couldn't have shot the film at least in the midwest where it was set..today it was about 50 degrees and windy on Halloween, the trees that haven't shed all their leaves are a beautiful mix of yellow, orange, and red. The ground is littered with dead leaves wind blown or raked into piles on every street. It is a very amazing atmosphere in the fall with the changing of seasons. At least in the movie they are wearing sweaters and jackets to make it seem like there is a chill in the air.<br /><br />Other than those minor issues perhaps, the film itself is really pretty good I think, the opening scene is the tragic night that started it all in 1963 as a young Myers stabs his sister to death. It then skips ahead to 1979 when Michael is locked up right before Halloween, and of course he manages to escape...which is a classic moment when the wonderful Dr. Loomis played by Donald Pleasance of course has had it up to here with excuses and why he was allowed to escape in the first place, Loomis is a nervous wreck throughout the film, with good reason. Him and the skeptical Sheriff are an oddball team at times trying to put a dent in Myers' rampage. Fav moment is Loomis staking out the old Myer's place and little Lonnie on a dare walks up to the front door and Loomis yells from behind the bushes...cracks me up every time I see it, and then while Loomis is enjoying his small victory, the Sheriff proceeds to scare the daylights out of Loomis.<br /><br />A very interesting look at high school life in the late 70's also, with the trio of Laurie, Linda, and Annie. Laurie is the brains of the bunch, and one Ben Tramer is the object of her secret desire...but we never really see this character, can't help but think Ben doesn't know what he's missing in a smart, beautiful, shy...yet somewhat rebelious (smoking pot with Annie) Laurie Strode. Linda (played by P.J. Soles) is a favorite character also, a wild child, who smokes, lusts after boys, drinks beers, and says \\"totally\\" about a dozen times in the film. Just another reason to love this movie.<br /><br />There's some violence of course, Micheal watches his victims, stalks his victims, and overpowers all that get in his way. To me it comes together with suspense and horror, plus a dash of comedy sprinkled in that make this one entertaining and totally fun to watch I think.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|Any movie about a devilish child is inevitably compared to either BAD SEED or THE OMEN and in its own perverse way ORPHAN measures up.<br />Buoyed by VERA FARMIGA's intense portrayal as the mother, this is a creepy over the top but ultimately chilling exercise in prepubescent terror.  ISABELLE HUHRMAN's frightening Esther is very effective and the underrated Peter Sarsgaard's doubtful father is great.  And I didn't see the \\"twist\\" coming either.  The snowy landscapes echo the chills and I really liked this movie!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I first saw this movie on Bravo back when they weren't running reality shows all night long, and after seeing it a few times just kept wanting to watch it even more. Getting the DVD has revealed alot...and also opened up a whole other world if you will. I'm not one to understand what Universe the film is in at any given moment, or try to decipher how time travel works. I can only fathom that the movie is smart, bratty, and for the most part brutally honest about high school life (or whatever Middlesex is), Jr. High etc...and the variety of students you would encounter.     Donnie is the independent one, who is smart enough to challange the norm, and stand up for what he believes...I think I understand why intelligent people are so angry and sometimes misunderstood, they see the world for what it is, they understand what is really going on around them, and they are really angry about it. Those of us who aren't intelligent to understand how we are being screwed, are just left in the dark, and it's up to Donnie Darko to save us all.    Very good film holds your attention, with some comedic moments, from whimsical to some off color comments that like I said are kids being kids, not always polite, and the music..the music makes this film all the more enjoyable. Good to hear some more alternative sounds, even the music choices are smart and are a major factor in the atmosphere of the movie. An amazing film to watch , even if you are not able to understand it like me, the whole concept...at least makes you want to understand it little by little, even if you are distracted by great characters in interesting situations throughout this time.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Good historical movie. Much to much talking but good political insite to British Political fighting. To understand everything a person needs to find out some historical background. But if you stay with it a very rewarding movie and well worth anyones time.
0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk is a case study in what is possible when passion, creativity and persistence combine. I've been a fan of his for a while and had reasonably high expectations for the book. I wasn't expecting the next \\"definitive\\" tome in the growing list of social media \\"must reads\\" but I was anticipating getting an inside glance of what makes Gary V. who he is - a genuine, engaging and successful entrepreneur. Not only wasn't let down on learning more about the man, I also found his advice to be sincere, practical and relevant - even in the ever changing social media landscape. Two many pundits and so called experts claim to have the silver bullet for social media success, Gary doesn't claim it (which I appreciate) but he does provide a pretty detailed road map on how you can leverage the increasingly popular medium of social media from blogs and video blogs through Twitter and Facebook to establish you/your company as a player in the space. The most resounding theme of the book - and one I totally loved - was his emphasis on hustle. Rome wasn't built in a day and Gary doesn't believe online success can be achieved overnight either. For anyone who is looking for a great book to give you insight into someone who not only \\"gets it\\" and has used it to build a successful enterprise, but also a great starting point for \\"cashing in on your own passion\\" it's hard to miss with this book.
B000003TAL|5.0|If you're one to follow along with the music critics and read those painfully subjective \\"Best Albums of all Time\\" lists, chances are you have seen \\"Daydream Nation\\" listed pretty high on some of them. Sonic Youth have always been a critics' darling, and at times it's difficult to understand why. If you listen to Sonic Youth prior to \\"Daydream Nation\\", you'll find a complex, almost confusing catalogue of songs crafted around what is essentially noise - feedback and distortion are featured quite prominantly in a number of SY's songs, and although there is no denying the originality and uniqueness of this approach to songwriting, it is certaintly an acquired taste.     \\"Daydream Nation\\" still features these destortion-laden tracks, but they no longer feel as formless or frustratingly complex as they once did. On the contrary, SY managed to merge this once chaotic sound seemlessly together with both structure and melody, and the results are nothing short of staggering. It is obvious from the very beginning of \\"Teen Age Riot\\" that you are in for quite an experience. The fast-paced, energetic guitar riff and snare rim clicks that follow Kim Gordon's dreamy vocal introduction is, for me, one of the single most amazing musical moments I've ever experienced, and it always manages to bring a smile to my face. Although \\"Teen Age Riot\\" is, without a doubt, the greatest song off this album (it's just the greatest song period), the remaining 13 tracks are still worthy of your undivided attention. \\"Silver Rocket\\" is a fantastic high-energy number that shows you that this album has no intention of slowing down. \\"The Sprawl\\" features some amazing guitar work from Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, and \\"Cross the Breeze\\" is a testament to the dynamic nature of the album itself, beginning with a beautiful, slow-paced guitar riff just before transitioning seemlessly into a fast-paced punk rock track.     Another thing that makes this album great is the fact that every member is at the top of their game. Thurston Moore, as usual, delivers the best tracks available on the album - Teen Age Riot, Silver Rocket, Total Trash, but the other members definitely hold their own. Lee Ranaldo is a force to be reckoned with, and he is better represented here than on any other SY album - tracks like \\"Rain King\\", \\"Hey Joni\\", and, one of the highlights of the album, \\"Eric's Trip\\", demonstrate his enormous skill as a songwriter. Even Kim Gordon shines on tracks such as \\"Kissability\\" and \\"Cross the Breeze\\". And of course, one of the greatest elements of SY is the tremendous skill of Steve Shelley, who's high-energy and innovative drumming provides the fuel that pushes these tracks along.     As is obvious, I have nothing but praise for this album. Not only is this Sonic Youth's most accessible work, but it is, without a doubt, their greatest accomplishment. That being said, I say this as a huge fan of indie and alternative rock. This album is NOT for everybody (the exception being \\"Teen Age Riot\\" - every person on the planet should hear that song), and I would use caution before purchasing it. If you are a fan of indie or post-punk, then by all means get Daydream Nation. I would even recommend it to those who are simply curious and want to expand their musical borders - Daydream Nation and Sonic Youth opened up a whole new world of music for me, and despite the many wonderful artists and albums I have discovered since my first listen of Daydream, I still find myself returning to it again and again. The fact is this is simply one of the greatest albums ever made, and as long as people continue to listen to music with guitars, this album will always have a place.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|After the first listen I was unsure if I liked this. But it keeps calling you back and now I can't stop listening to it. This album is truly brilliant.
0393964582|4.0|I have a fetish for classic novels and have read just about everything from Pride and Prejudice to The Three Musketeers to Brom Stoker's Dracula, so naturally when I found a copy of Frankenstein at Barnes and Noble I bought it and was not disapointed. Written in that wonderfully poetic and intelectual style of the old masters of liturature it is a tale of Ambition, forbidden practices, horror, madness, anguish, and retribution. If you are the kind of person who expects a classic horror film type story full of gore and violence then you will be in for a disapointment. The real focus of the story is within the mind of good Doctor Frankenstien himself (who was actually quite young) and the monster he created. Also, if you only like happy endings, this book is not for you. If not, this is a great book only dampened by the fact that it is not longer. Fans of Dracula will love this story and thank God for the 'Little Ice Age' that brought this book into being.
B000002JSN|5.0|A classic example of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.  That said, there are no weak songs on this album.  The lesser songs merely support the greater in the diversity of their scope.  There is no greater example of Led Zeppelin demonstrating what they could express musically than this album.  This is their equivalent of the Beatles \\"White Album\\".  A musical journey that never disappoints.  Desert Island Disk?  I want a copy of this album folded under my arms in my coffin!

B002UD56I6|5.0|This Is It movie is a Must See!!! The best documentary this year bar none. It's inspiring, riveting , bittersweet and funny. Watching this movie brought tears to my eyes, made me smile, made me dance, made me sing, he rocked it all over again! MJ looked happy, healthy and exuberant. The scenery and dance moves were fantastic .Inspiring creative genius throughout the entire film. Sometimes you forget Michael is dead, because he's so alive in \\"This Is It.\\" Other times, you're struck with a profound sadness when you remember that what is on screen really is the last piece of history from an artist who truly cared about his craft and excelled at executing it. And that we'll never see him again    Michael was astute, polite, compassionate ,a great leader and teacher  both as a performer and as a human being. The world lost a genius and great humanitarian. I am saddened by this great loss. I felt like I was at a concert and He was just rehearsing. Everybody at the theater were dancing and clapping after each song.  What a great concert this would have been? I did not want the movie to end. The energy of the concert stuck with me well after watching it .   I loved every minute and I am going to see it several more times. I cannot wait for the DVD.  MJ was really all about L.O.V.E. Run to see it!!!!!!
0618918248|5.0|After Sir Richard Attenborough, Richard Dawkins is probably the wrold's most famous natural philosopher.  Dawkins is also the world's most famous advocate of evolution, and enemy of creationism.  This is his latest book, and it specifically targets the logic of religious thought.  The book's title is not quite appropriate to its subject.  Instead, Dawkins clearly states that he thinks the existence of God is a hypothesis that can be proven or disproven.  He then proceeds to cite evidence that argues against the existence of God.  Much of this evidence has been previously stated in some of his essays, public debates, editorials, and books.  Dawkis specifically takes on the arguments for the existence of God made by others, ranging from Pat Robertson to Saint Augustine.  Dawkins does not expound on the theory of evolution, or on the physical models behind the origins of the universe.  This he has done in previous books, and refers to them instead.  All told, a great book, and appropriate for any class in the humanities, philosophy, history, or sociology.
B001TOVXFM|5.0|In the tradition of Jet Li's \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Fist of Legend\\", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal \\"Shah Po Lang\\" in 2005. \\"IP MAN\\" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of \\"Wing Chun\\" (invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.<br /><br />In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Wong Fei Hung learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.<br /><br />Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....<br /><br />The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.<br /><br />There is very minor characterization involved. The film has three acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act portrays the effect of the Japanese invasion on the people of China, and on the life of Master Ip and his family--which leads to the film's min encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.<br /><br />As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and occasional acrobatics. Highlights include, Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Wilson Yip and company knows how to shoot fight sequences and their skill proves the film's showstopper.<br /><br />The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's \\"Ip Man\\" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in using his fists to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a \\"based on true events\\" type of deal.<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in \\"Once upon a Time in China\\" and Huo Yuan Jia in \\"Fearless\\") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. \\"IP MAN\\" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring \\"IP MAN 2\\", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, I've read that Wong Kar-Wai's version of \\"IP MAN\\" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance as well as action thrills.<br /><br />Still, this film comes with a \\"Highly Recommended\\" rating from me, it does rule as martial arts action film.

1410420442|5.0|Life should be good for Katniss Everdeen now: she not only survived and won The Capitol's Hunger Games, she outsmarted the powers that be and saved her fellow player from District Twelve, Peeta. She's rich now, living in a special section reserved for victors of the Games, and her mother and little sister are safe from the hunger that surrounds her community. Even better, she's able to spend her Sundays back in the woods with her best friend Gale, hunting and sharing their special bond. And then The Capitol comes calling for Katniss and Peeta to do their Victory Tour of the other districts and once again, Katniss finds herself in unbelievable danger as she realizes that the government will do anything to make her pay the price for defying them.<br /><br />Wow.  Just Wow. Catching Fire had me from the first pages and didn't let go (and still hasn't). As Katniss and Peeta tour the other districts, they see that there is more oppression out there than they'd realized, and they are unable to stop themselves from speaking out, however subtly, against The Capitol. Of course this doesn't go over well and the pair know they will have to pour on their pretend love affair thickly in hopes that they can repair the damage they've done. It's only when they return home to a very changed District Twelve that it becomes clear that they are going to have to pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />The characterizations in this novel just got better and better as the story went on, with Katniss and Peeta's relationship deepening significantly. Collins does an outstanding job of making Katniss uncertain to whom her heart belongs as her life is on the line. Haymitch is back as well; his personal demons seem poised to destroy him on the surface, but is he hiding behind them for different reasons than it seems? So many layers, so much going on, all of it unbelievable in its wonderful, riveting awfulness.<br /><br />The world Suzanne Collins has created in Catching Fire is grim and despicable; yet hope abounds in the symbols of Katniss, Peeta, and a mockingjay pin. With former Games victors mixed into this novel, I could begin to see and understand the desperation that exists on all levels of this dystopian world. With all the action, betrayals, and subterfuge going on, I had to force myself not to gulp this entire book down in one big gorging session. With the final page, my anxiety was still climbing, and I know for a fact it won't be relieved until I hold the next book in the series in my hot little hands. It's that good.

159448385X|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a book that will grip you from the first page forward. This book, written by Hosseini, portrays the picture of coming of age in a modern time period. This book, gives a perspective on Afghanistan life. The book beautifully portrays the story of two women, as two loose ends waiting to become a beautiful quilt. The story also portrays friendship in a very honorable manner. Laila's friendship with Mariam proved that love and friendship have no boundaries. This book portrays a teenager's point of view of a real friendship versus a superficial one. For example, Mariam is obsessed with her dad's `love' to her. As time passes by, Mariam recognizes the people who mean a lot to her, to the point of dying for their freedom. Even though this book is a wonderfully written book, there are some flaws to it. The overload of twists and turns make the plot too complicated, making it hard for the reader to understand. Also, some of the concepts get old throughout the book. The overwhelming amount of depression and sadness, can take you to the point where the story drags you along with it. The characters are so depressed to the point where there is nothing positive in their lives. Overall, this book was a decent story, but some flaws made the story long and depressing.
B0025KVLUG|3.0|The three stars are actually for George Martin's soundtrack strings - people bash it for being \\"not beatles\\" but it is not that bad really for what it is - orchestral soundtrack music quite well done. The Beatles' songs on this album are in far better form in the recently remixed release. The songs that sound somewhat weak on this album due to bad mixing (especially \\"Hey Bulldog\\") shine on the previously released remixed soundtrack album. Instead of George Martin - you get Beatle selections from \\"Rubber Soul\\" \\"Revolver\\" \\"Sgt Pepper\\" that fit right in with the theme of the fantasy and also appeared in the movie soundtrack. The remix from 1999 is one of the few Capitol hits out of the ballpark - this strict remaster is just ok for the purists.
0691142165|5.0|This book is very well documented, with tons of data, anecdotes and references that let the reader decide how deep he might want to go in a given theme. Reinhart and Rogoff explain brilliantly the details of financial crisis from different perspectives, like currency crisis, banking crisis or debt crisis, with a unique historical perspective.    I will like to highlight section 3, where they focus on issues related to domestic debt, which are often forgotten or overlooked in the related literature that mostly focuses in external debt. Reinhart and Rogoff know that bringing domestic debt into the picture is critical, because it lets us understand how a process of high inflation is related to a crisis, besides the usual channel that is through currency devaluation.  There is also an interesting discussion regarding seniority issues between domestic and international debt bondholders.     I would also recommend the section about the US crisis. The authors present a very up to date discussion about it and discuss the policy options ahead. It is very hard to have so many references, data, thoughts and information in just one volume, but Reinhart and Rogoff did it. This book will become in the Ecyclopedia of Crisis in the years ahead.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I like many others on here have been hoping Alice In Chains would somehow find a way to be reborn. With Layne gone (R.I.P.) due to his sad addiction to heroin and other mind and body killing drugs, the task to find a replacement for him and his tortured style of singing would be a monumental task and not one that should have been taken lightly.<br /><br />Well obviously the remaining members understood that and took their time in finding the right replacement. Yes Layne style had a massive impact or the overall sound of the band from the get go, but Jerry also provided a lot of that angst as well with his back up vocals, song writing and his lyrics. Yes a key member was lost to us, but the new Alice in Chains is very much as relevant as the old band ever was. If it wasn't, then why are we all here writing about this group? The fact is, they are and always will be a band that has a certain vibe happening and this is why we come.<br /><br />This new release is simply a fantastic listen from beginning to end. It's an Alice In Chains cd, theirs no doubting that. It sounds like them in every way and that my friends is what we all had hoped for. I'm still a fan and always will be as these guys to quote Judas Priest here, \\"deliver the goods\\".<br /><br />Great listen check it out!
1401223176|5.0|For me, the grittier and less &#34;super&#34; the hero, the better--hence the appeal of Batman. Here's what I think is great, and not so great, about Hush:<br /><br />What's GREAT:<br /><br />* WRITING: I haven't read a ton of Jeff Loeb, but what I have is considerably better than average. As another reviewer mentioned, Hush did feel a little &#34;contrived&#34; at points, with perhaps a few too many characters shoe-horned in. That aside, I have to give Loeb a 9/10 for a great, gritty, solid story arc.<br /><br />* ART: There's a level of maturity in Jim Lee's art here that I didn't always notice (in the often miserably written dreck that passed for comics) in the 1990s. Always technically brilliant, Lee's forms are a little more restrained. Women, in particular don't have cleavage ready to burst onto the next page... Meanwhile, Lee's depth, design and attention to detail are simply stunning. There is an electrical crackle to his pages that will drop your jaw, catch your breath, and snap your head back if you're not ready for it. In the forward, Lee showers praise on his inker, Scott Williams, and the colorist, Alex Sinclair. The final product is memorable. Finally, the muted, Alex Ross-esque &#34;flashback&#34; scenes are excellent!<br /><br />Heroes & Villains: The Bats/Cats dynamic was great. Croc was pretty interesting. Harley Quin was fun. I don't want to ruin anything for those who haven't read this yet, so I'll stop there.<br /><br />NOT so great:<br /><br />* Superman: Sorry, but invulnerability annoys me, the vast majority of lame muggles not fingering Clark for Supes annoys me, kryptonite annoys me like a puss-producing rash, and Krypto the Dog Wonder makes me want to tie an anvil to my tongue, and drop it from a tall building. I put up with Superman, but Super Dog needs to be flown to Bizarro Land, and abandoned.<br /><br />* Lady Shiva: She reads (at least here) like a lame carryover from the mindless '90s. Send her back...<br /><br />Little Grievances:<br /><br />* Bruce Wayne is a bazillionaire. If Obama has a bullet-resistant suit (he really does!), Batman should be fully bullet-proofed. If Gordon can mosey up behind The Bats, wing his arm (and draw blood), any decent shot with a gun could kill him. I'm sorry, but real world technology has gone so far beyond the &#34;Bat-leotard&#34; that it's time DC stopped asking readers to suspend their disbelief.<br /><br />* &#34;Poor little rich boy&#34; Bruce Wayne is so done already. How about recasting Wayne losing lots of $ in an economic downturn?<br /><br />* ART: There is one small beef I have with Lee's art: Virtually all of the heroes' (particularly the males) faces look nearly identical. When Wayne meets Kent, they're indistinguishable. If Bruce's friend Thomas Elliot didn't have red hair, he'd be pretty much identical too. I wish great artists like Lee would make more of an effort to differentiate.<br /><br />Overall though, big, big fun.ly does!), Batman should be fully bullet-proofed.

B0029LHW4U|3.0|Marginal Quality at Best . . .     I know the legions of Alice-in-Chains devotees (read: uncritical fans who'll swallow down just about anything the band releases or might release in the future) will disagree with the following review of their new album.     For me, this release was a bitter pill to swallow.     I'm not sure that I agree wholeheartedly with what many are saying in their reviews about Cantrell's tactless decision to retain the name \\"Alice-in-Chains\\" when Staley was (and is) a central part of that band, and beyond this, Cantrell's seemingly brazen and audacious move to get a Staley-sound-alike to handle the vocals.     These issues have been thoroughly discussed, and they are no way influencing my three-star rating of this release, which is based on the simple fact that the songs are all mediocre at best. The tracks are a few notches in quality above the songs that Alice-in-Chains contributed to the soundtrack of Last Action Hero, and pretty much on par with some of the weaker tracks on the \\"Tripod\\" release.     I agree with several of the reviewers, in that AIC have certainly perfected the fomal aspects of their music, e.g., the deep, textured anti-harmonies and the layering of the guitar sounds have never been more complex or impressive (also, the production is superior on this release). However, despite all of this, the actual quality of the song-writing, as compared to their earlier music, is sorely lacking in my opinion. And, isn't that what it's all about, really?     This is not the place to initiate a discussion about music as a social construct, a production of a specific time, place, and historical mood (the Zeitgeist of the times, if you will), but I was there when MTV first programmed \\"Man in the Box,\\" and, I must say, that there was at once something \\"depressing\\" and even nihilistic about the Seattle Grunge-mavens smashing the clay legs of the '80's rock-and-roll idols and something strangely invigorating about witnessing their fall (and,because we listened to the music of \\"Chains\\" et al, we too were partaking in the trans-valuation of rock-and-roll values). I wanted to be a \\"yea-sayer\\" to the mood that engulfed my being when listening to AIC's music at that time.      Maybe it's my problem, and not the band's problem at all. Perhaps I'm viewing this new release through the \\"old,\\" tainted lenses of the 1990's - plain and simple. And further, perhaps it's unfair to measure this release against the criterion established by AIC when they produced some of the best music of the '90's, e.g., Facelift, Sap, Dirt, Jar of Flies.    I can't with good conscience recommend this to original fans of the band (from the '90's), and certainly not to younger listeners who might be first coming to the band. My recommendation, save your money on this, and have someone burn a CD of it for you.
0385504225|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment.  The plot was thin, the characters one dimensional, and the writing poor.

Out of body nonsense has been discredited, etc.     We don't need this.  I hope Brown enjoys his ill gotten gains.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Purchased through a different retailer, this film was the first I watched on a new Blu-ray player and sound system. Perhaps I'm not the AV-snob others think we all ought to be, but watching this film was a revelation. I don't have a home theater space, rather just a simple 47\\" flat-screen and a room I can get pretty dark during the day. This film was beautiful to watch, and there were no playback issues (Panasonic DMP-BD60), picture quality was stunning (Phillips 47PFL7422D), and the sound quality was simply phenomenal (Onkyo HT-S6200). All in all, a fantastic film that is worth watching in Blu-ray format simply to see the splendor you missed the first time around.<br /><br />To those who complained about DNR/EE, I'm assuming you have a much more sophisticated home theater set up than I do. For the regular Joe out there with a basic flat screen who thinks of HDMI as a jump, this disc is just fine.

1597801577|5.0|Others have written more on this book than I care to write, but I feel strongly enough about that I want to add to the praise.  This is one of the finest science fiction books I've ever encountered.  I'm much more a fan of literature than of science fiction, and \\"The Windup Girl\\" deserves to be talked about in terms of great literature.  I have nothing against science fiction, but a lot of it never gets past an initial creative idea, and a lot of SF writing is not exactly powerfully written.  This book surpasses all the limitations that plague the genre.  It's a stunningly good book, and those who like depth in a story should definitely read it.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I was fortunate enough in 1994 to attend a test screening of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, shortly after its triumph at Cannes and months before it premiered in the U.S. Because I saw it before it was acknowledged as a game-changing sensation, I was completely unprepared for my mind being blown. I remember sitting in the dark theater, sort of giggling to myself in a low voice, because I was in absolutely alien territory; I had no idea what was going to come next, and I knew I'd never seen anything like it before. (Tarantino attended the screening and I got a chance afterwards to shake his hand, after which I just walked away, rather than say, \\"huminah-huminah-huminah.\\")    Coming out of Inglourious Basterds, I realized that Tarantino is still blowing my mind, as he has with each of his post-Pulp Fiction films. This is not because I think his films are perfect, and not even necessarily because he's my favorite director, but rather because I think Tarantino is trying for something in his films that's absolutely different than anyone else's work.    Basterds is a multi-threaded take on a World War II film. It weaves together a series of stories taking place in Nazi-occupied France, and it's exciting, suspenseful, thoughtful and funny (Brad Pitt is an absolute hoot, and he, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent pretty much walk away with the film). But like every other Tarantino film, it's actually really all about movies above all other concerns, including plot.    That's where Tarantino runs into trouble with some critics. They say that his films are all about movies, not real life, that the films are simply a series of film references. The worst criticism? His films are mere exercises in genre.    I think that's missing the point. Yes, Tarantino loves genre films and loves to mix genres. But he's doing some remarkable things with them. I think he's trying to build serious art with the raw materials of genre. It's akin to taking an electric guitar, an accordion anda triangle and writing a symphony with them - and succeeding.    Some say that Pulp Fiction was his most mature work, if by \\"mature\\" we mean conventionally artistic. Under this view, later films, which more explicitly take use the mechanics of gangster, blaxploitation, revenge and, oddly enough, European art cinema, are less \\"personal,\\" less serious. But that may reflect more about what you think about genre than about anything else. If you believe genre is artless, low-brow moviemaking, then the use of the film vocabulary from genre in service of personal, artistic filmmaking is confusing and unsettling. If you can accept that art is about personal vision, not the tools you use to express that vision, then Tarantino's approach can be exhilarating and thrilling.    Employing that personal vision, Tarantino has no problem using David Bowie's great \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\" in a period film, or splashing a blaxploitation-era logo to flash the name of one particularly colorful character, or using narration when it's necessary and forgetting about it when it's not, or opting for long stretches of subtitled dialog (I think this was Tarantino - who's calling card is his expertise in dialogue - tying one hand behind his back for the fun of it). Tarantino even uses little signifiers - signifiers as little as the fonts he uses in his \\"chapter\\" markers and in the end credits - to let you know you're in his unique, personal world.    As Tarantino himself said in a great appearance on the Howard Stern radio show recently, his work is unambiguously his work - you'll either love him or hate him, and that's because he has a singular, idiosyncratic voice. I love his work and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.    One more thought [and mild spoiler alert] - I hope it doesn't become an issue that in Basterds, Tarantino is playing fast and loose with the facts of world history (let's just say that at some point Basterds and history go down different roads). It's called an alternate history - a device used by everyone from comic book artists to serious writers like James Ellroy. Is there any real concern that people will mistake Tarantino-esque fiction for historical fact? If that's the case, we should worry a little less about Tarantino and a little more about our education system.

The New Moon soundtrack is HORRIBLE...worst CD I've EVER bought...and that is no lie.  I listened to it straight out of the store, and immediately thought that whoever picked out the song arrangement is a JOKE.  Don't buy...you're wasting your money.  If you don't believe me then listen to the song samples first.

It has amazed me how little I knew about my own behaviors...and hangups!    If you want to know more about yourself...read this book.    Good read.
1573300403|5.0|To me, this is the best MJ DVD to have for devoted Michael Jackson fans. Michael sends us the message beyond the grave that he loves us and we should always remember that. This magnificant work also shows Michael's fun playful side, as well as his serious side, and his great, dedicated humanitarian efforts. We have lost a true angel on earth, but we can rest assured knowing that he is an angel in heaven.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout because at 20 minutes, there's no excuse for not finding time for it every day.  I do it first thing in the morning, and then it's out of the way! It's tough, but I've been doing it for about a week now and I actually feel energized after it's over.  Can't wait to continue to challenge myself with the next levels!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Fantastic representation of who Michael Jackson was. I had heard and read of his perfectionism and inability to settle for anything less than his personal best; however, this film truly embodies and lives up to the hype. He was a kind soul whose work radiated love, faith, and hope. It's all about the \\"L-O-V-E\\". Truly a must see for any MJ fan.

0345308239|4.0|Before I even opened the book, I agreed with Tuchman's major thesis about folly. \\"Don't ascribe to conspiracy what can be explained by incompetence\\" is a motto that I frequently find myself repeating as I consider either business or politics. I also like Tuchman quite a bit as a writer, would probably describe her as one of my favorite historians.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found this book less satisfying than the other books that I have read by her. This may, in part, be because it is a book that she wrote much later in her life than, say, [[ASIN:0345476093 The Guns of August]] (my personal favorite so far of her works). It may just be that working with this kind of approach was more difficult than she thought before she began the project. It seems to me that the other books that I have read by her focused more on an event or period, and drew ideas and themes from her reflections on the same. This book begins with the idea, and draws from historical examples to support the thought. Harder, I think. And unfortunately less satisfying for this particular reader.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the book fails to be worth reading. It breaks down into chapters on the Trojan War, the Renaissance Popes, The British loss of America, and US participation in Vietnam. Of these, I found the Renaissance Popes the most interesting. By this I mean that I learned the most from the chapter. The section on the British in North America would make an interesting counterpoint to Gordon Wood, but seemed at times to lose itself in detail. I had the feeling that the point of the book was to culminate with the chapter on Vietnam and it probably most hurt my experience that this section was the least compelling for me-- both in terms of its ideas and its prose.<br /><br />If you haven't read any Tuchman before this, and are primarily interested in her as a writer, then I would start with [[ASIN:0345476093 The Guns of August]] before picking this up. If you're interested in the thesis, then this is probably a good acquisition, even if it is not the strongest of her works.good acquisition, even if it is not the strongest of her works.

1401917186|1.0|We all want to feel appreciated, special and validated and Doreen Virtue gets A+ for her skill in making that happen.  Herein lies the problem with her book Realms of the Earth Angels.  She has found a hidden marketing ploy to categorically include the human race by detailing \\"angel types.\\"<br /><br />It is human nature to discover \\"our type, our birth stone, our sign, etc.,\\" and not think deeply enough to see the descriptive flow of temperaments and characteristics in each type, stone or sign is reworded and reworked in a way that is true about everyone on the planet.<br /><br />It's a deceptive work of trickery by a writer who has found a way to make people think they are \\"earth angels\\" therefore addictions to food, drugs and alcohol are acceptable.  Is her next book going to make exceptions for \\"earth angels\\" as they commit unthinkable acts of evil like incest, murder and torture!  The sad part is her approach WORKS!

B002KDUDG6|5.0|There is nothing not to love about Michael Buble's \\"Crazy Love.\\"  As usual, he puts his own creative spin on classics.  His voice is impeccable.  The original material is great.  The two duets on the CD, \\"Baby, You've Got What it Takes,\\" and \\"Whatever it Takes,\\"  are especially memorable.  Anybody who watched the TV show \\"Family Ties\\" in the '80's will be transported back when they hear the song, \\"At This Moment.\\"  I can still picture Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan dancing to the original version of that song.
1906694176|5.0|I won't go over the plot etc. since others have done that already. I give it five stars because it is very well written and engrossing and has a satisfying ending even though more were planned in the series. But I agree with other reviewers that the story is best when told through Salander. The Girl Who Played With Fire is an amazing, rip-roaring book that is the strongest of the trilogy. I would recommend reading Fire again before Hornet's Nest because it can be hard to remember exactly who all the characters were. Some of the names are similar and the number of characters is exceptionally large. Larrson gets away with it because the story is so good and Salander is so compelling.<br /><br />There is a rumor going around that there are more Larsson books in a girlfriend's computer. That would be cool.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This double CD is well worth the purchase.  Although we all probably have the songs on the first CD, most all have been remastered and sound even better (If we even thought that was possible).  The 'new' song \\"This Is It\\" is awesome too.  The demos and the spoken poem on the second CD are worth the purchase alone.  He sounds incredible singing \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" acoustically.  The poem \\"Planet Earth\\" is from MJ's \\"Dancing the Dream\\" book of poetry and reflections written in 1992 and it's absolutely beautiful to hear.  The 36 page booklet of pics from his recent rehearsals is a nice addition too.  Also, it doesn't hurt to know that most of the proceeds help to support his legacy ~ his children.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The Twilight soundtrack rocks... a perfect acoutrement to the movie.  I am a huge collector of soundtracks, and this one fits the bill- every track is worthy of note.

B002RKSHR4|5.0|I doubt there's an english-speaking child who doesn't have at least some familiarity with some version of this story; I think every saturday morning cartoon series ever did some version of this, and every other sitcom. This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.<br /><br />That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.<br /><br />Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work (1203 kindle \\"locations\\"), and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).<br /><br />Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.<br /><br />So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.<br /><br />If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommend  _David Copperfield_; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty).<br /><br />One note on this kindle edition: it's a bit awkwardly formatted, with the page numbers of the original marked in brackets,  a \\"list of illustrations\\" that are not included, and odd chunks of capitalized text (presumably captions to the nonexistent illustrations). Still, perfectly readable despite that, and it's free.two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|As to this kindle edition: it's reasonably well-formatted on the k2, but still has a few typos; the spacing is generally clear. There wasn't a clickable table of contents -- like a lot of other free Kindle books, this is pure text only -- but since this is really more a single short story than it is a book (1065 kindle \\"locations\\"), that's not a major fault, and the price makes up for it.<br /><br />As to the story itself: I doubt there's an english-speaking child who doesn't have at least some familiarity with some version of it; I think every saturday morning cartoon series ever did some version, and every other sitcom.

1416914307|5.0|I absolutely adore these books! Beautifully written, in my opinion, and it grabs you once you read a page into any book. Cassandra Clare is amazing and has already over run my two favourite other authors; she has enticed and inspired me to begin writing my own novel. I experienced a fantastic feeling when reading and were so good that I stayed up until 3:00 am reading them. I love all of the characters their wonderfully amazing and so cool. I was enthralled reading every book. I was never disappointed at any moment always excited and enjoyed reading them at any time, I kept forgetting to do my French, World History, and Algebra homewrok because I was completely absorbed into the books. I was so sad when I finished the City of Glass because it was so amazing and I never wanted it to run out of pages and desired for the story to continue on and on for me to read it forever. I adore all the humor and twisted love webs. The Mortal Instruments were beautiful to read and I thoroughly enjoyed them all; lots of action and romance, I recommend them to any person who loves a superbly sublime urban fantasy, or likes to read. I can't wait until Cassandra Clare finishes the City of Fallen Angels, coming out 2010!!!!! Ugh sooooo long!!! But it's woth the wait! xD :) ^-^

People like author Mario Vargas Llosa acted the same way and did not want the triolgy to end. I can't wait to read the next two. NOW, I need them NOW!<br />Mr. Larsson's taut story with its twists and turns is delicious. Other reviewers have already dissected the plot, so I am just adding a comment from someone who reads a couple of books a week. LOVED IT!!!!!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Sometimes the hype gets in the way of letting us really see things for what they are. A few minutes into Michael Jackson's \\"This Is It\\" proves that this does not apply here.<br /><br />No question about it - Michael holds back throughout these two hours of footage; these are part and parcel rehearsals. The filming is non-deliberate and unexacting. However, these truths serve to make \\"This Is It\\" all the more affecting. Like reading a diary entry, to see Michael in rehearsal is to see him totally unscripted and in-the-moment, the consummate professional even in spite of an arena full of empty seats.<br /><br />\\"Billie Jean\\" is stark and lovely, with Michael taking center stage without the help of dancers or back-up vocalists, strutting and spinning like in days of old. The simplicity of how this particular song was supposed to work is perhaps the most deeply affecting moment of the film<br /><br />The bombast is handled with edge and precision on other selections, though. \\"Earth Song\\" mixes an impressive short film with on-stage spectacle, and \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" hits like a ton of bricks with Jackson's powerhouse vocals (lip-synced though they may be, this was a rehearsal), universal lyrics and dazzling body control as he adheres to the challenging choreography.<br /><br />Some of the most rewarding moments come where they are least expected, such as when Michael and a sound technician lightly bicker over specificities of a track playback. It's particularly cute - not to mention entertaining and moving - to see Michael serenade the lucky young woman to sing the female part on \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\\" Toward the conclusion of the song Jackson reaches for some high notes, leaving the young singer staring at him in admiration. He kindly reminds her with a gesture of his arm that the audience will be in front of the stage; she had better face them, not him.<br /><br />The professionalism of all involved is consummate and beyond reproach. The utter investment and enthusiasm exuded by the dynamic back-up dancers, musicians and crew, including director Kenny Ortega, are as befitting of a Michael Jackson project as could be imagined. Their blood, sweat and tears all dripped into this show and \\"This Is It\\" makes this abundantly clear, and the unbridled joy they shared sculpting this project is endlessly palpable.<br /><br />Those looking for a full-on Michael Jackson concert will be better served by purchasing a Hi-Def TV with booming surround sound and slipping in the \\"Dangerous: Live in Bucharest\\" DVD. \\"This Is It\\" does not suit this purpose but is rather a unique, (semi)-unfiltered snapshot of the greatest concert that might have been, starring the greatest entertainer of his generation, if not all time. In that light it is certainly a film that is one of a kind, not to mention one that will be viewed with fascination for generations to come.<br /><br />Could Michael have pulled off performing this show 50 times in London's 02? We'll never know, but \\"This Is It\\" ably demonstrates that if he had the results would have been eye-popping, sweet on the ears and downright startling - an overwhelming combination of sights and sounds to blow the minds of millions. For a man who set the bar so startlingly high a title like the King of Pop is only getting started.back-up dancers, musicians and crew, including director Kenny Ortega, are as befitting of a Michael Jackson project as could be imagined.

B000UR9T7I|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the comic book based movie Spider-Man 3. Of the three Spider-Man movies, this is the most complex with the deepest focus on the main characters. Tobey Maguire & Kristen Dunst return in the key roles. The overall plot is about a strange black creature arrives on the Earth and ultimately bonds with Peter Parker making a \\"black Spider-man\\". There are several sub-plots in the movie which add to the complexity of the story. There is Harry the son of the bad guy from Spider-Man 2 who first wants revenge for the death of his father, then loses his memory and ultimately things work out OK. There is the \\"SandMan\\" who was the guy who really killed Parker's father; able to shift any/all of his body to sand he is difficult to fight. And then there is the engagement of Parker and MJ; well maybe.<br /><br />As with all of the other Spider-Man movies, this one is extremely well made with good story, good characters and good action. Good special effects. The only reason for not giving a 5 star is the complexity of the plot which doesn't seem to flow well.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Depeche Mode since I was around 12 or 13 years old when I heard their music on the radio station Q-101 back in Chicago. Many years since then including buying their CDs, I came to notice a profound change from the light, somewhat obtuse experimental pop of \\"Broken Frame\\" and \\"Construction Time\\" towards the darker and more austere industrial electronica of \\"Violator\\" through the harsh electronica of \\"Playing The Angel\\". All in all, I've always been willing to wait years between releases because of how DM evolved between releases.<br /><br />Their newest album \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" proves this with a profound departure from it's immediate predecessors and marks a welcome return to the early days of 1982-84 DM. It almost seems like a long overdue sequel to \\"Construction Time Again\\" that took 26 years to release. :) The bell-chime sounds heard in \\"In Chains\\" reinforce my point with this review. While certainly having 21st century technology and polish, SOTU has the feeling of DM actually hopping into a time machine, travelling back to the New Wave era of 1982-84, taking the recording equipment from the studios that existed at that time, bringing it back to 2009-10 and into today's studio and using that recording technology in addition and \\"Sounds of the Universe\\".<br /><br /> Some of the harder edged styles are maintained on \\"Hole to Feed\\" as well as the grating (not in a bad way) turbulence of \\"Come Back\\". Even then, they are a far distant cry from anything on \\"Playing The Angel\\" or \\"Violator\\".<br /><br /> On the other side of the coin, \\"Peace\\", \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Corrupt\\" are easy fits for the 1983-ish era. \\"Peace\\" is an experimental trip back to the early 80s with 21st century polish in every way, including even the rhythm. \\"Perfect\\" is the same way too. \\"Corrupt\\" could almost have been recorded in 1982. All of them are great songs. Other favorites are \\"In Sympathy\\" and \\"Fragile Tension\\" which are a class of their own.<br /><br /> Many fans of \\"Violator\\", \\"Ultra\\", or \\"Playing The Angel\\" will likely find this album to be a change of seasons or a disappointment but not me. I happen to be a much of a fan of their pre-1984 era as I am of post 1985 DM and on rare occasions enjoy \\"Broken Frame\\" even more than \\"Violator\\" or \\"Ultra\\". A lot of post 1989-DM fans are not going to like SOTU a whole lot or should expect a completely different sound but for me, as a fan of the lighter DM of early days, it is a real treat to hear this long forgotten side of Depeche Mode. It took a while for me to to sink in but \\"Sounds of The Universe\\" is once again another landmark chapter in Depeche Mode's history. Highly Recommended.laying The Angel\\" will likely find this album to be a change of seasons or a disappointment but not me.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the comic book based Batman movie, The Dark Knight. By far, the darkest of the Batman movies and by far the longest of the movies. At 2hr 35min, frankly it is way too long and could be tightened-up. This movie focuses on the Joker and presents a sad, horrible and sick person rather than the odd funny joker of other Batman movies. This Joker is really evil.<br /><br />The movie is richly made and grandly photographed with really great action scenes and special effects. I highly recommend this movie, just be prepared for a long experience. Oh, the Blu-Ray is packed with interesting behind the scenes materials.
B000O76T8Q|3.0|I was disapointed in how poor the definition was on this \\"special edition\\". the scan lines were often clearly visible and distracting when people were talking or when displaying graphics like the text sent on the deep dive.    If you have a large TV even with a good DVD player that upscales well, it will make for poor viewing. Too bad because this was a spectacular special effects movie.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is a finely focused and astute script turned into a funny, touching, honest film...riding on the iconic shoulders of John Wayne. Under the mostly bubbling surface lay some deep themes that are exposed but not dwelt upon. Comedy seems to work best when there is a semi-tragic base for it to take flight from. If you are of a certain age and grew-up in John Wayne World then this film will be a real treat.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|At the time that I wrote this review I hadn't bought either of the box sets yet, but I had listened to them with friends on my system, and others. I've since bought the Stereo Box, the Mono Box, The U.S. Box, The USB Apple and both Capitol box sets. Still, my original observations about some of the ludicrous assertions by some reviewers and why you should buy these sets still holds true.<br /> One of the most stupid comparisons to date is that the Capitol Box sets sound better. Well, they do if you love over-compression, and harmonic distortion, particularly on Meet the Beatles and 2nd, (this is how we first heard the Beatles in this country by way of the Capitol engineers attempt to 'improve' the recordings with added compression and reverb for American listeners). I do own the Capitol sets, because I'm nostalgic that way, not because they were superior recordings.<br /> If you are hearing mud out of these new re-masters, either you have a crap system, no real reference as to how music should sound, or you need a Q-tip to get all of that wax out of your head.<br /> As a RE-MASTER, NOT A REMIX, this sounds great! Granted, I would love to see the catalog remixed, ala Yellow Submarine Songtrack as an optional set down the road, but these are THE original two-channel mixes, pumped and filtered a bit, but not in a heavy handed way and to the benefit of the material overall. And unlike their vinyl and 1987 CD counterparts, the low frequencies have not been attenuated.<br /> Then there are the the audiophiles that pontificate as to how horrible this set sounds compared to the original vinyl and 1987 CD's, (usually in broad technical terms that they often misuse). Please remember; audiophiles only believe in vinyl and tubes and all else is false and defective audio-wise. To admit that a CD can sound better than vinyl would be an admission that they may be wrong about vinyl superiority and sound in general (and spending 100,000.00 on a turntable does not give you gravitas). Most are not engineers, or musicians, and don't really know what music really sounds like, they just know what they like, and take those likes as gospel. I'm pretty sure that these same people would find fault with even the original source masters. So disregard these 'experts' and get this box set! If it sounds bad to you, double check your system and your ears.<br /> I am an active recording/mastering engineer,(about 30 years now) and an active musician (about 40 years, and I play three instruments), and a die-hard audiophile for the last 46 years (although I now prefer being called an audio enthusiast, as audiophiles are now viewed as snobs and loonies in most circles) and I really like what I am hearing on these discs, including the Mono CD's.<br /> I think the other complaints stem from a change to the familiar. These do sound different from the original issues, (better I think), with enough difference to put some listeners out of their comfort zone, (something like,&#34;it should sound the way I remember, not like a new release&#34;).<br /> Funny thing is, I used to have all but a few Beatle albums on pre-recorded open reel tape, which sounded much better than the vinyl at the time (still do), and these CD's put me in mind of the quality level of some of those tapes. The few I still have do sound better than the original CD releases, and much better than the vinyl ( these are the Capitol duplicated tapes, not the later Ampex tapes). My few audiophile friends have been stunned with how great the old tapes sound, but are unhappy with the re-mastered CD's that sound frighteningly like those tapes, but with better clarity and warmth. Go figure.<br />The other stupid comments I've seen is that there are songs missing. Hello! These are Parlophone/EMI versions of the albums. Open up the Past Masters discs, and I think you'll find the missing tunes, genius.<br /> One more thing regarding the hard-panned stereo mixes; if you compare these recordings to the previous versions, you will note the material is somewhat softer panned than before.  This type of mix was not unique to George Martin. I have many early stereo releases that are very strangely panned, or hard panned. It was the nature, I think, for record producers to get the most exaggerated stereo effect possible in those days. The Beatle mixes are mild in comparison to many records I have from the same time period.<br /> As to the Mono box, this is not for everyone. Those of us that remember the mono mixes will find this collection priceless and a welcome addition. These were real mixes, not just an engineer combining the left and right channels together, and they differ from the stereo mixes in most cases, in that some things are more predominant or forward in the mix. They do sound different, but I think that these mixes will be better appreciated by those few of us that can remember those versions, and some new initiates with good ears.<br /> One of the more moronic criticisms state that 'you can't clearly distinguish the instruments or vocals in the mono mix' and then call it 'muddy sounding'. Yo! idiot! It's MONAURAL! ONE CHANNEL! It's not muddy or confused, it's the nature of mono. You get more cancellation in a mono mix. These sound like they are supposed to, the way we originally heard The Beatles on our radios, Mono record players and HiFi sets, only much better (minus the Capitol engineers addition of reverb and compression).<br /> BEWARE OF THE CHINESE COUNTERFEITS! At a certain auction site, that's all I could find! If it's selling for 100.00 and the thing says 'Made in EU' , run, don't walk back to Amazon, or a reputable seller.<br />Once you're sure you've found a legitimate version, buy the CD's and enjoy. Just remember, It's Getting Better All The Time! (Now if we could only see a remastered copy of 'Rarities' someday). Cheers!softer panned than before.

B002Q4U9YU|2.0|After watching the This Is It film, this CD is a huge let down! It's probably what happens when people try to make quick and easy money. If it wasn't for the second disc, this would be nothing more than a compilation of old songs with a new cover. It would have been much better if they put the rehearsal recordings, with the live instrumentals. Even though MJ sometimes didn't sing through the whole song, it was great to hear the superb musicians that were going on tour with him.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw the movie on 10/29/09 although I had bought advance tickets for a later date. But I just had to see it sooner and I'm glad I did. The film was refreshingly wonderful and so engaging, although the theater audience was mostly quiet throughout. However, there were moments of laughter at some points as the audience experienced MJ's funny and playful side. But for the most part, everyone were quiet having their own personal experiences and individual emotions as they witnessed this momentous event. And at the end everyone applauded. The movie really was done with integrity to represent Michael Jackson in an honorable way. Kenny Ortega, Michael's long-time friend and creative partner, clearly must have really understood the real Michael Jackson. It has been a long time since Michael has been so respectfully represented by anyone.<br /><br />You can clearly see that putting together the \\"This is It\\" concert series was indeed a labor of love for everyone involved and Michael was the one orchestrating and commanding the whole thing. His dedication, hard work, passion, loving encouragement and leadership were quite evident in the film. It's unfortunate that much of these traits and the real goodness of Michael Jackson as a person were so tarnished by ill-willed personal assaults while he was alive. I hope that we will see much more of these wonderful and truthful portrayals of the man who committed his whole life to giving and sharing his gift and talents even in the midst of much ridicule. He was beyond genius, he embodied music, dance, artistic vision; and always managed to bring us on the ride of our lives. \\"This is It\\" leaves you feeling uplifted and inspired.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw the movie today. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. All I can say is that this movie was incredible. Michael was so real. He knew what he wanted, how he wanted it and he said it with \\"L-O-V-E\\". I can't express anymore on how much I miss him. I wish June 25th would have just been another day in the neighborhood. But it wasn't. It will be a day that I'll never forget and I'm so glad that Kenny Ortega was able to capture all that footage and show us what Mike was really all about. I can't wait for the DVD, I'm going to Pre-Order it so I'll have it. Please if you haven't seen it, GO!!!!!

B0013816GK|5.0|Carlo Maria Giulini was a gentle and spiritual man by reputation.  This recording of the Verdi Requiem wih the Berlin Phil from 1989 represents Giulini's devotion to what some call Verdi's best opera, \\"The Verdi Requiem.\\"  In addition to his passionate conducting Giulini has the Berlin Philharmonic, an orchestra that played well for him on several occasions, a first rate chorus and Sharon Sweet, Florence Quivar, Vinson Cole and Simon Estes as solists.  Verdi challenges his performers in this work.  Especially the soloists, most of all the soprano soloist.  The soloists really do a wonderful job here.  My most questionable choice on this recording was that of Vinson Cole as the tenor soloist.  Having heard him in an art song recital and being very moved, I thought he would be too light for a Verdi's Requiem.  I usually think of Jose Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti, Carlo Bergonzi, Placido Domingo or Jussi Bjoerling as ideal for the tenor solo in this work.  Vinson Cole has a lighter timbre then those singers, but you forget that when you listen to his musicality.  He brings a beautiful cupo color to his singing several time in this performance.  In the \\"Ingemisco\\" he handles both high b flats with ease.  Simon Estes does a fine job as the bass soloist, including a beautiful pianissimo on the word \\"benedictis\\" in the bass solo \\"Confutatis.\\"  Florence Quivar sings very beautifully in the \\"Liber Scriptus\\" that Verdi sets so skillfully.  The soloist who is challenged the most in this work is the soprano.  The \\"Libera me\\" puts the ball in the sopranos court because it is her, chorus and orchestra.  Sharon Sweet, a dramatic soprano does more than live up to the challenge.  She sings beautifully and sells this section at the same time.  Giulini's coachings with the soloists really paid off because of his sense of colors and word stress.  He asks the soloists to sing soft in sections that are often sung forte to great effect.  I was very moved by every aspect of this recording.  I bought it expecting to love Giulini and the orchestra and have mixed feelings about the soloists and chorus.  Luckily the performance proved me wrong.

0385504225|2.0|It's an okay, yet disappointing and aggravating read. Mary Pope Osborne, the author of the children's Magic Treehouse Series, does a better job of didactically presenting history in an adventure format. Way too much padding. The surprises aren't surprising. The writing stinks. \\"Langon pointed to a black shadow that was materializing on the lawn to their left. The shadow began as an amorphous blob, but it was growing quickly, moving in their direction, becoming more defined, rushing at them faster and faster, stretching, and finally transforming itself into a massive black triangle crowned by two impossibly tall spires.  \\"The cathedral facade is blocking the searchlight,\\" Langdon said.  \\"They're landing out front!\\"  Langdon grabbed Catherine's hand. \\"Run! Now!\\"\\"    The final revelation that throughout the book has everyone gasping and turning pale is laughable. The unbelievable CIA chief is non-other than the costume designer from the cartoon movie, The Incredibles. The main villain seems to be modeled after the villain character from the Mummy movies.

Much of the book is sophisticated and educational, but most of the book is drilling into your head that religion is wholeheartedly unnecessary.  -a conclusion I came to years ago.  If your on the teeter-totter of Agnosticism, this book might help you come to your senses.  Gods do not exist.  The supernatural, however is another story IMHO....

B001CDLAT4|4.0|Yes, yes, this is a beautiful and stunning film. But read on.<br /><br />First, there is a theme of unsettling footage of people staring directly into the camera. It's unsettling because they just stare without emotion, for probably at least 10 seconds at a time (which is a long time to stare at someone staring back at you). It's unsettling, but extremely interesting. I think this is a good part of the film. This is something you don't generally see in everyday life.<br /><br />However, be warned, or maybe that's too strong a term, but you should be aware that there are a few parts that are disturbing. I would say these parts are political, except that without any commentary it is the viewer who is left to draw their own conclusions, rather than any conclusions being posited. For instance, there is a rather lengthy part showing chickens in a production farm that is somewhat disturbing. The handling of chicks is shown, with them sliding down chutes as if they were pills being sorted into jars. In fact they are being sorted, but into which two groups? The ambiguity is disturbing. Then a worker is burning or cutting the beaks of the chicks and roughly tossing htem aside. And then a worker holds chicks down in a contraption that does something to their necks. All this bothersome imagery comes in the middle of an otherwise beautiful series of vignettes. I thought it kind of ruined the mood of wonder and enjoyment.<br /><br />More bothersome imagery is shown at the end, when fields of burning oil wells are shown, smoke filling the sky, and a scene of soldiers with stacks of ordnance around them. Again, I thought this emotionally violent footage ruined the beauty of the film.<br /><br />I do think the film is compelling enough to overcome these negative parts however. One of the interesting habits of the film is how it draws a comparison between various unrelated scenes. For instance, it shows a tribal society performing a lively dance and then cuts to images of a busy subway, drawing a parallel between the pace of life of different cultures. There is also a lot of parallels drawn between different ancient ruins. The film segues fluidly (for the most part) between one scene to the next.<br /><br />Check it out and fast forward through the negative bits.the pace of life of different cultures.

B002Q4U9YU|1.0|Absolutely none of the live music from the movie is on this CD - it is all studio releases and demos.    This is the first time I have ever seen the \\"soundtrack\\" of a live performance movie contain none of the actual live performance.   The music from the movie is very good . . . maybe it will be available for purchase later.   I would pass on this one.
B002KVSJ7S|3.0|Some stand-out cuts - no, the lead single is not one of them and a curious choice - but unlike the immediately enjoyable \\"Life in Cartoon Motion,\\" this collection seems to try to capture that magic... and falls sadly short.  \\"Blame it on the Girls,\\" \\"Toy Boy\\" and \\"Blue Eyes\\" show that Mika still has the knack for catchy and/or poignant pop.  But \\"Rain\\" sounds like something that didn't make the cut for \\"Cartoon\\" and \\"Dr. John\\" is sadly dull.  After repeated plays, I don't see this one making it into my heavy rotation.  But there's enough promise to look forward to more from Mika.
B0006J28BO|3.0|I love the movie, it's funny and sweet, when it arrived however the case was cracked and now the edge of one of the corners has fallen off, it was shipped in one of those small paper envelopes with the bubble wrap glued inside of it. Also i'd bought it from one of Amazon's vendor's not Amazon itself, i've never had issues when i get something from Amazon directly, however i have run into some shipping problems with other vendor's before.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|The This Is It song, 3 demo tracks and poem are what save this CD from being a complete waste. The 36 page photo booklet is not all photos of MJ and half the pictures are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to identify who is in them. I feel the advertisement for this CD was very misleading because the official MJ website released the demos as examples of what would be on this CD, which lead me to beleive even though the songs were not new (obviously not new since MJ let us, the fans, choose which songs he would perform) the singing/performance of them would be new AND would be recordings from his concert rehearsals. I feel disappointed and cheated. For the This Is It tracks, demos and poem I give it 3 stars instead of 1.

It was such an amazing idea to go on, but it felt like the author barely scratched the surface of what it could be. Normally I can fall into any book and read it very quickly, but every time I sat down I had to reread because I wasnt truly enjoying it. Maybe Uglies just wasnt my kind of book. The story does not flow beautifully or keep you on edge, it jerks you around and not in a good way.

0307454541|3.0|Well, I finally finished the book.  I almost gave up on this expansive story several times and then WHAMMO-something intriguing would happen.  The story centers around the influential Vanger family in Sweden, specifically Henrik Vanger.  He has been obsessed with the disappearance of his grand niece decades ago.  Henrik finally hires a down-on his luck journalist by the name of Mikael Bloomkvist to pick up on the investigation where Henrik himself gave up.  The cororate and financial aspects of this novel were a bore for me.  It was also hard for me to feel totally immersed in this story  because the names and locations of the towns in Sweden got in the way.  I liked the charachters, though and their relationships to each other.  The characters were all very fleshed out at the beginning of the book, but they continued to grow as the story progressed.  I loved Lisbeth  Salander.  Despite her apparent Autism spectrum disorder, she let nothing and no one stand in her way.  I will read the two subsequent novels simply to find out what happens with her.

0743270754|5.0|Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest leaders who has ever graced the United States of America. When America needed a great and wise man most, during our terrible civil war, President Lincoln was there to see us through. His down to earth honesty, tremendous wisdom, generous humanity, wonderful humor, personal tragedies and struggles and always tender heart are here revealed in a most thorough and captivating way. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a national treasure herself. She has once again illuminated a major part of the American story, with intelligence, clarity and smooth as silk writing. Living was tough in the 19th century. Illness and early death were part of many families lives. Lincoln and almost every member of his administration faced terrible heart ache and losses that seemed too much to bear. To read how many of them grew to love and respect each other and rely on each other was very touching and real. And then there were the schemers and manipulators that Lincoln gave every chance for redemption and change. Failing generals and ineffective or jealous key administration officials were given many second chances (too many for some of them!) by the understanding, patient and magnanimous Mr. Lincoln. Alas, no one was as big a man as Abraham Lincoln and as we learn in this book of the greater and lesser people who surrounded our sixteenth president, the greater Lincoln becomes before our eyes and before history. Thank you Doris and may you forever rest in peace, Abraham Lincoln, a most magnificent human being and our greatest president.   P.S. I do wish Lincoln could have stopped the abuse and persecution of native Americans but the Civil War consumed his Presidency. If anyone could have changed this new country's horrendous treatment of its native inhabitants I would like to think it would have been Lincoln.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|There are 3 types of Elvis fans:  Those who like the FUN early stuff 50's to mid 60's;   Those who like the SERIOUS later stuff (late 60's to his death);  and those who like it all.      For those buying this expecting material that sounds like Hound Dog or Don't Be Cruel, you will be disappointed.  This is Elvis in 1969 doing SERIOUS, more complicated material for an adult contemporary audience.  THIS IS ALSO AMONG HIS BEST MATERIAL.  Actually, this album is unique among all other elvis albums.  Elvis never did material like this again or with this same texture.  It was his return to serious music and one can hear in his voice that he was really showing a side to himself that had been dormant (if not undiscovered) previously.     While Elvis had most of his landmark fun songs in the 50s & early 60's, he had his serious, more vocally challenging songs in the 70's.  Listen to his voice doing a ballad in 1955 (blue moon)  vs My Way from 1977.  Sounds like 2 different artists.  His later voice (even beyond this album prior to his death) was that of someone with a range of an opera singer.     So, if you have never ventured into serious material, this is a place to start, however, I would recommend Elvis Thats The Way It Is (and seeing the documentary of the same name) before listening to this album.  There needs to be a transition for some fans when they break away from the 50's stuff and mature into his later music.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is living proof that a book cannot be judged by its description.  At its simplest, yes, this book can be called a survival story.  There are, however, so many more layers to it all.  It is all about the human to human interactions as opposed to the human to environment interactions one would expect in a survival stories.  It's such a lousy summary to give, \\"A reality show survivalist story\\" when there's so much more to it all.  So I was skeptical when I first began reading, and it did seem to fall into that category.  I had a bit of difficulty, due to that fact, getting into the book.  However, once I found a good, quiet block of time, I sat down and read straight through and loved it.  It's all so suspenseful, as you really have no idea who will live and who will die going from page to page.  I made predictions, some came true, some did not.  Overall, I think the appeal to this book is the appealing personality of the main character and its ease of reading--I know 11 year olds who have read and loved this book.  It's easy reading, but once you go up the age scale, there's more and more depth to the overall story, making lots of real world connections to pitting countries against each other in brutal wars.  I was hoping to see more of this, the internal workings of the Capitol, some more background history (parts of the history they are fed seem veeery dodgy, and I'd like to know more), and I'm really hoping this is a vital point of Catching Fire.  I am also definitely hoping Catching Fire is about an overthrowing of the existing system, as well as more of the interaction between Katniss and Gale.  I'm getting more than a little sick of Peeta.  There were plenty of hints and clues along the way, and I'm hoping some of them (the pin, the ruins, Katniss's father's death, etc) come into play in the sequel.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5
B002TYZKIM|5.0|FANTASTIC!!!  What a great movie.  I saw the This Is It Movie on Halloween afternoon, 10/31/09.  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.  I was in awe at the sheer talent and energy exhibited by Michael Jackson.  I saw a part of him that I might never have seen if he had lived, though I would much prefer he was alive.  He was so at ease with everyone involved and showed what a truly wonderful human being he was.  He showed so much compassion and love for the people he performed with and the human race in general.  I had no idea how much work, energy, effort and thought went into his performances.  I watched him fly through the rehearsals like the expert superstar that he was.  There will never, ever be another Michael Jackson - no one can come close to being at his level.  He knew exactly how everything should sound, when it should be heard, how loud or soft it should be, everything.  And he was the man in charge - the one who called the shots at all times.  I kept wondering how he could possibly know all this and be so good at it.  I was amazed at his fabulous dance steps and his incredible voice.  Then I realized - no wonder he is the King of Pop - he has been doing this since he was a little boy.  It is in his blood, every cell of his body, it was his whole life.  He was awesome in the rehearsals and I know he would have been even more amazing than anyone could imagine if he had lived to perform the London shows.  It would have been his life's greatest accomplishment.  But I am so pleased and profoundly grateful to his family and others who allowed This Is It the movie to be filmed.  I don't know if Michael would have liked it if he knew we would see him rehearsing rather than the live performance, but given the circumstances, I know he would be happy that his family left a great treasure for his fans around the world in this movie.  I can't wait to own the DVD.  Of all the Michael Jackson DVDs, this one will be the most special to me.  He had no idea that this would be the last show for him.  I pray that he is in heaven singing and dancing with the angels and waiting on the rest of the world to catch up to him!  God Bless you Michael - I will always love you and appreciate the gift of your life and talents that you gave to the world.

068987474X|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is trying to find Mr. Right..it really opened her eyes..it made her relize what jerks guys can be and it taught her don't just settle... the right one is out there just waiting to find her  This book should be read by any female that is dating from 16 to 60 or more... both my girls (16 and 23) have learned from this book \\"YOU WILL KNOW IF HE IS REALLY INTO YOU\\".........
0385341008|5.0|I probably would not have selected this book to read, except I just joined a book club and this was their book for the month of October.  Once I began reading it, I could not put it down.
015206396X|1.0|Graceling has a beautiful cover, great premise, and lots of hype, and would be a terrific novel if it weren't for the terrible writing and atrocious main character.<br /><br />What is with the awkward sentence structures and prose in this book? \\"In these dungeons the darkess was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.\\" It should be \\"In these dungeons, the darkness was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.\\" And look at the next sentence: \\"One that had so far proven to be correct, as Oll's maps tended to do.\\" What? That made absolutely no sense. Instead: \\"One that had so far proven to correct, as Oll's maps tended to be.\\" Wouldn't that be better?<br /><br />Then later on... \\"Turning when it was time to turn...\\" What? Isn't that redundant? And: \\"She began to hear voices as she entered a corridor where the darkness flickered orange with the light of a torch set in the wall.\\" Dude, darkness does not flicker orange, if it did then that would not make it dark. And it's not with the light of a torch, but light *from* a torch. That whole sentence is just full of awkward phrasing and clunky description.<br /><br />And the next: \\"Katsa crept toward the light and the sound of laughter.\\" How can she creep toward laughter when it wasn't even introduced earlier? It just does not get any better. And later on, she pulls her hood down over her eyes. What the hell. How do you expect to fight if you can't see where the heck you're going or what you're doing. It's not a surprise she trips over the four guards because OBVIOUSLY, you can't see anything! Why does she need to pull her hood down to hide her eyes when the guard she fights later ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE IS? Okay, that's it. I'm done.<br /><br />But the biggest offense of the book was the main character.<br /><br />Katsa is the most annoying, aggravating, self-centered, abusive, and violent character I've ever had the misfortune to read from the eyes from. I thought Bella was tops (in annoying characters), but Katsa wins the prize. During the book there were many instances where I wished I could rip her hair out and run her through with her own sword.<br /><br />She is the biggest Mary Sue I've ever seen published. It wasn't so bad that she was Graced with some special ability but hers was off the wall unbelievable that I couldn't give her any sort of realistic credibility at all. Not only can she kill anyone with her bare hands, she's faster than anyone, builds fire better than anyone, hunts better than anyone, shoots and fires arrows better than anyone, yet she doesn't suffer from the freezing cold as the rest of her comrades - it just slows her down when other normal people would be down on the ground dying from hypothermia. She doesn't even tire like the rest of them because she just has unending bundles of stamina. So much so that she can go for days without sleeping even though they were in some pretty gruesome and difficult battles... And the list goes on. I mean what can Ms. Perfect not do? But that wasn't the worst of it. Katsa's most unredeeming factor was her attitude.<br /><br />No one can tell her to do anything she doesn't want to do even if it's for the wiser. And if she doesn't like what she hears, her first reaction is anger, and then she throws until a tantrum until she gets her way. But yet, every situation she finds unappealing to her, the first though that comes to mind is violence. I clearly remember a scene where Po told her his opinion which wasn't demeaning, cruel, or hurtful at all, and you know what she does? Hits him so hard he falls off his chair and has a wicked bruise. W-T-F. And not only that, her characterization is inconsistent. She's supposed to be this bad ass chick who takes no crap from anyone and doesn't need a man in her life to define her but as soon as Po enters and tells her he's going to leave she cries tears because she \\"doesn't know why\\"? What the hell kind of crap is this? And what is her utter revulsion to marriage? I mean, I don't want to get married as well but Katsa's reasoning behind this is not concrete or sufficient enough to support her viewpoint that she vehemently defends many times throughout the book.<br /><br />I was absolutely disgusted, *disgusted*, by the way she treated her horses. She treats them as a way to serve her own self-satisfying needs without care. The first instance that stuck me was when Po and Katsa were riding off somewhere and she slammed her horse against Po's because she wanted to get his attention. W-T-F! Not only is that dangerous to the rider because they could fall off, but it's dangerous to the horse! Slamming into another horse while you're riding is NOT something you do. The horse could have fallen because the impact threw him off balance, and you're obviously not going to walk away from that injury free, or it could have tripped and then fallen. Not to mention she ALWAYS pushes her horses to ride fast because she has no patience and wants to get there faster, and if someone tells her they needed to rest the horses or they'll break them, she just throws hissy fits about how they have to hurry and they're just slowing her down. Horses are not machines, good god! They're living breathing animals that need care just like we do!<br /><br />The next one was near the end of the book where she pushed everyone so hard, and rode for hours at a blistering gallop just so they could reach their destination faster. And then  I clearly remember someone, Skye, I believe it was telling her that she lamed a horse. And you know what Katsa's response to this was? \\"Oh, he's not lame! He's perfectly fine\\" and then throws a fit about how he's slowing them down and they need to get up and ride him harder so they can get to their destination faster. OMFG! I almost threw the book across the room in rage.<br /><br />The place names were very uncreative. You might think they're clever but they were shallow attempts at trying to make them seem more \\"fantasy\\" epic-like. They were just barely concealed renamings of East, West, South, North, and Middle. And I didn't even get started on the writing. It was super choppy, suffered from an annoying excess of repetitive phrasing, and without a lot of \\"showing\\". The structure was all the same. Katsa went and did this, did that, felt this, and so on and so forth. Another problem was the insane amounts of info-dumping in the beginning. After the third page, I just couldn't give a rip about the places' history, what it looked like, who was who's father.<br /><br />I can see why a lot of people love this book. There's romance, a super strong female character that kicks butt, and the tried and true quest/adventure formula of a fantasy novel. But it's just not for me. I absolutely hate not finishing a series so I'll probably read the next one, but ugh, not looking forward to it.<br /><br />My opinion? Avoid this book like the plague. I may probably be stoned to death for this review because every where I go it seems to be so well loved and praised with glowing reviews.his is not concrete or sufficient enough to support her viewpoint that she vehemently defends many times throughout the book.

B002ECJZ76|4.0|This Finnish film tells the story of Nikolas, who, as a young boy, is orphaned. The villagers, not knowing what else to do, decide that a different family will provide Nikolas his home for a year, and each Christmas, Nikolas will move to the next family. During this process, Nikolas begins carving wooden animals and other toys to repay his friends' kindness, and he leaves these gifts outside the recipients' doors on Christmas.    At one point, a local carpenter, Iisakki (the wonderful Finnish actor Kari Väänänen), discovers Nikolas's ability with carving and convinces the village that he should take Nikolas in. Gruff and bitter at first, Iisakki insists that Nikolas refer to him as \\"Master\\" and treats the boy as a servant. Eventually, though, Iisakki warms to the boy, and they develop a caring relationship as Nikolas continues his gift-giving.    The film is wonderful to look at, shot as it was in Finnish Lapland, and there is little to prevent fairly young children from enjoying the film. The film is rated PG because of \\"mild thematic elements and brief smoking,\\" according to the MPAA. The thematic elements, I presume, are primarily the elements that make Nikolas an orphan (the deaths of his parents and young brother). The smoking refers to pipes that several of the characters have.    DVD extras include a \\"making of\\" featurette (in Finnish with English subtitles) and the film's trailer (in English). The film is in English with no option for the original Finnish language, and there are no subtitles available for the feature.
0743298039|5.0|This book was excellent. It is one of those can't put me down books & just so intriguing & surprising. A very worth while read!!
0307387151|5.0|Well, unfortunately it was the film that made me feel the need to read this. Usually it is the other way around. The story itself was beautifully told and the lesson is drilled in from the moment the crime incident occurs.  I especially loved the retelling of the war and Dunkirk. I, at 32, nor even my mother, was alive at that time... but it gave me the sense of knowing and understanding.  On another note, you almost feel sad for Briony that she lived the rest of her life with a sense of regret... but the loss for Cecilia and Robbie was far greater. Lesson learned, Mr. McEwan, Thank You. <3
074322454X|5.0|Stephen E. Ambrose wrote Band of Brothers to show what it was like going through the European Campaign during World War II as an American Soldier. He takes you through E (Easy) company's journey around Europe making you feel their highest highs and lowest lows with a want for all the excitement to continue, but thankfully for E company it didn't.     Ambrose's fist hand account, from hours of interview with veterans of E company and visiting the actual battle sites, shows the heartbreaking part of war. When the men had to seek shelter in their foxholes while they saw their friends be hit by German artillery, how some soldiers couldn't take the constant pressure from the risk they are taking, and how a bad leader in the company could ruin the entire company. All the while, you feel how strong of a bond was created between these men, so strong that they would do anything for another to get out of the war. On the flip side, E company does succeed in some of its ventures and the happiness from them just pours out of the pages. Every reader gets to experience the war through the shoes of someone who was there and how the survivors continued to live after the war through Ambrose's creative style and clever weaving of story and interview.    By the last part of the book, I think that Stephen E. Ambrose has accomplished what the men of E company wanted to express: They had a job and they did it, but they all just wanted the war to end along with the bloodshed.

0545123267|4.0|So I read a few reviews on other sites comparing \\"Shiver\\" to the 'diluted version of Twilight'. This is NOT another version of Twilight nor is it 'diluted' in any way.     We meet Grace and Sam immediately and it becomes pretty clear from the start that Sam is the werewolf and Grace is the girl he has eyes for. She has suffered a traumatic attack as a child in her very own backyard and her life begins to unfold soon after. Grace is not your typical teenager with nagging parents and a horrible existence at school. She has the kind of parents that need parenting themselves and although Grace is more than happy to oblige, she stops and wonders from time time if they ever really care about her. For someone like me who was born to a teenage single mother and felt like she was a sister more than a parent growing up, it was very easy for me to understand Grace's plight when dealing with her parents.     Sam becomes a very important part of her life. He saved her from an almost fatal attack as a child and has watched her ever since. Grace has felt the pull and attraction to the woods and especially her 'wolf' from the time she was 6 years old. How is it possible that she knows when he is watching her without spotting him, feels his presence before he appears, understands his feelings without ever communicating? This is what Grace has to figure out for her own.   She has two best friends and they play an important role in her relationship with Sam.     Everything explodes when a school mate, Jack, is killed presumably by wolves. Just as his parents prepare to deal with the grief of a funeral, his body disappears from the morgue. We soon learn that Jack, Sam, Grace, her friends and even Jack's sister Isabel are all connected by the mystery that surrounds their town. The woods hold many secrets and they unravel right before their eyes.     It's very easy to say that this is the story that could have been written for Jacob from the Twilight Series but within the first few pagesyou see that Sam an Jacob are as different as they come. Even if they are both wolves. Maggie Stiefvater's writing flows and is lyrical in so many ways. She has a way of intoxicating the reader and bringing them into Grace and Sam's world. I usually take notice of what page I'm on when reading and then figure out how many more pages I have to go before the end of the book. I never did that with \\"Shiver\\"! Before I knew it I was on page 227 and I was immediately thinking 'I hope this goes on forever, better slow down my reading so it doesn't end so soon'. Give this book a try, go for it! Its worth it!
B0000524CY|3.0|Scariest movie yet Inaccurate and Offensive(antiCatholic-nasty scene) loosely based on a true story about a boy many years before. Lots of profanity and vomit, Yet yes it is very Creepy and Scary.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Great, great movie.  It has a great story, is hilarious at times, and also a tear jerker. I've watched this I don't know how many times (but I don't watch the ending any more).  However, if  you are the old-fashioned catholic type, I would not watch it.  My husband's parents are that type, and because of how much we loved the movie we wanted to share it with them and watch it with them. Just a half hour or so into the movie, they got up to leave. They were so disturbed, they would not even stay to visit with the movie off. For them, the stuff going on between the teenager and Kevin Spacey was disturbing and disgusting. But we LOVE it.
B000001F9N|5.0|I bought the black vinyl version of this album back in the seventies and am just now getting around to buying the CD and hearing this wonderful music all over again.  It has been over 30 years since I have heard some of those songs on this album.  Brings back wonderful memories.  The quality of the CD is excellent, I listen to it in my car all the time.  Sounds just like Donna Summer recorded yesterday.  I am very pleased.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|It is such a shame on how they chose to promote this movie - focusing on Michelle Pfifer's part in the movie. She is not the reason to watch this.

It's basically a fabulous romantic comedy with fantasy-type stuff. and Robert Deniro is great and funny too.

B001BWQWKS|5.0|This disc won the 2009 Gramophone Record of the Year award, and deservedly so. The Ebene Quartet play with immaculate technical assurance, ardour and the appropriate Gallic flair. The sound is clear, natural and lifelike. The \\"product\\" is so good as to equal and on occasions better the classic Italian Quartet performances on Phillips. That disc only couples the Debussy and Ravel. The Ebene include the rarely recorded Faure quartet; a work previously unfamiliar to me. This was Faure's final composition; it is somewhat meandering in nature but repeated listening reveals it to be a composition of autumnal beauty and well worth investigating. Bravo!

Like all sleazy creationists all he can do is \\"steal the work of real scientists ... their ideas are contradicted by the evidence, so their only strategy is to delete the parts that make them uncomfortable, and put a false spin on what's left.\\" (from the PZ Myers blog)    It's hard to believe sometimes the audacity and hypocrisy of these creationist nut-jobs, these so-called godly people who are so without moral standards, who try to impose their stupidity on the rest of the world.

B000ASATYO|1.0|This is not a review of the movie The Frighteners but of Amazon.com and their policy of bleeding reviews from one DVD of a movie over to another regardless of how different they are.    You have to hand it to Amazon.com. The anti-film heads who run the site have never meet one version of a DVD a movie that they didn't consider exactly like another. Amazon.com repeatedly bleeds reviews from older DVDs into newer one. So even if the DVD is a different version of the film than the previous one (in this case Amazon brings together reviews of the directors cut of The Frighteners with those of the theatrical version) or if the new DVD is a better or worse transfer relative to the earlier DVD (there are numerous instances where reviews of a poor quality DVD by one company are bled together even if the newer DVD is done by quality companies like The Criterion Collection) Amazon.com doesn't care. Instead Amazon's policy is to merge reviews of previous DVD releases with those of later DVD releases creating, in the process, a kind of postmodernist hogepodge where real differences in DVD technology or content no longer matter.     I guess postmodernism has indeed triumphed.
0060849827|5.0|This is a good purchase for those who need a handy, accessible guide to survival. The British SAS is THE authority on survival in harsh environments, and the author gives us the advantage of their skills without having to sign up! I never thought to pay attention to dimension sizes when buying books, so I didn't really think the book would have such small dimensions (it's a little bit bigger than a pack of cigarettes), but I am glad it does, it makes it really handy to toss in to a backpack. The low price makes it a good idea to buy several, one for the car, one for the house and one for the backpack. This guide covers it all, from how to properly hunt, process, cook and store all sorts of game animals and edible plants, but helps you identify the stuff that will kill you or make you sick! It also covers the making of shelters and rafts, weapons for hunting, medical aid techniques, weather prediction...the list is just too big to fit in this review. This book is an essential guide for those who do serious backpacking / hiking / camping, or travel overseas to remote regions of the world.

B001KVZ6ES|5.0|After reflection, discussion and further reflection, I'm raising my rating from  4 to 5 stars for this late-career Eastwood achievement.  Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" stands out as the most \\"artful\\"--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to \\"tell the story\\" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, \\"Gran Torino\\" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as \\"heroes\\" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, \\"Gran Torino\\" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.<br /><br />I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary \\"action\\" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to \\"father\\"--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.<br /><br />These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two \\"basic needs\\": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)<br /><br />In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the \\"intentional fallacy\\" (\\"Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question\\"; or \\"You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different.\\").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to \\"equalize\\" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before \\"Gran Torino\\" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.<br /><br />I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a \\"noirish\\" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like \\"Tightrope\\" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.<br /><br />[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).

143911000X|4.0|This book was hilarious, as well as as a worthy tie-in to HIMYM.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, but unfortunately, it is really, really short.  It takes maybe an hour to breeze through - so for the price, it won't keep you entertained for long.
B000GB775E|5.0|This movie was really rad,you have to watch it.I didnt think it was going to be good,but i turned out to be really amazing.Plus McFly is the hottest uk band ever.They rock.You should totally see it.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Breaking Ben has been one of my favorite artists for the majority of the last decade.  I've been headbanging to their music since Polyamorous hit the radio.  Through that time, through the records Saturate, We Are Not Alone, and Phobia, each album proved the band had a wide array of talent and was capable of melding many different sounds and beats into their own style.  Look at \\"Next to Nothing\\" from Saturate, \\"Forget it\\" from We are Not Alone (or \\"Rain\\" if you point out that \\"Forget It\\" was cowritten with Billy Corrigan), and \\"You\\" from Phobia.  Dear Agony is a great album, but quite bluntly I expected more.  I was disappointed at first, but after listening to it probably a couple dozen times or more now, I say that it is, in fact, a great album, and while it didn't quite meet my expectations for variety, it did surprise me in a couple ways.    Now for what makes Dear Agony great:  The album rocks from start to end.  Not only does it rock, however, but it does something that previous albums did not: It flows.  Each song flows into the next, making the album feel not just like a rock album, but also a story.  These days when I put the CD in and play it, I find that if I'm doing something else at the time, I stop paying any attention to the album and start rocking to the drums and base and feeling myself move to the soul in Aaron's guitar and Ben's voice.  A few tracks, including the title track \\"Dear Agony\\", are simply mesmerizing.    So while I expected more in the way of variety, it did grow on me in the time that I've owned it.  It's a great album to have, to listen to, to rock out to, and I can even program to it.  I have no regrets about buying it and if I had downloaded it to listen to it at first, I would gladly pay for it now, which to me says 5 stars.

B002S0OBFK|5.0|In an age when so many \\"horror\\" films rely on blood and gore in a sensory-overload attempt to scare people, \\"Paranormal Activities\\" stands way out from the crowd. It also goes to show that you don't need to spend millions of dollars or hire big names to make a bloody good film.<br /><br />For people who have seen \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Cloverfield\\", the style of movie will be familiar. It's a home-video style of shoot where the camera is being held by one of the two key players Micah and Katie or is placed on a tripod. Unlike either of the aforementioned movies, however, the camera control in this film is much better and there are few nausea-inducing moments that were more frequent in \\"Cloverfield\\". Also, the camera being on a tripod for a good part of the film helps keep things steady and allows you to concentrate on what is going on.<br /><br />The story is quite simple. We start the film with Micah testing out his new video camera, purchased to try and record some weird things that have started happening at night in the couple's house. Katie has experience these \\"happenings\\" off-and-on since childhood and is scared. Micah thinks it's pretty cool and one gets the feeling that he's thinking \\"reality show\\" down the road.<br /><br />The camera is placed in a corner of the room, the couple goes to sleep and...things start happening.<br /><br />What is absolutely brilliant is that, whether you \\"believe\\" or not, you're sucked into the story and the action. Director Oren Peli doesn't beat you up with effects. He's taken the \\"less is more\\" approach that is so sorely lacking in 99% of current \\"horror\\" films and uses it, at first to give you goosebumps and, as the film progresses, scare the hell out of you. There are many scenes where the build up is worse than the fright. There is no music to let you know what's about to happen. This is, after all, \\"home movie\\", but what does happen us just plausible enough and, when mixed with the daytime interaction between Micah and Katie, that we end up thinking \\"get out of the damn house\\". Except they can't.<br /><br />The only other actors in the film are a friend of Katie's who is really just \\"there\\" and a Psychic who tells the couple that they're not being haunted by ghosts but something he can't help them with...though he knows someone who can.<br /><br />Anyway, without trying to give away too much, events get more freaky. The camera records a lot, sometimes fast-forwarding through the night until we get to an \\"action\\" scene. Peli uses the time indicator to excellent effect and one's eyes keep wandering to the lower right part of the screen, somewhat hoping that it's going to be dawn soon.<br /><br />The ending is brilliant and perfect.<br /><br />If you're looking for blood and gore, this isn't it. If you don't like the \\"found footage\\" style of movie, then this isn't for you either, though the way Peli has directed it makes it much easier to watch more believable that either \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Cloverfield\\". There were parts of these films that left you thinking \\"put the camera down, you can't have this conversation with a camera in hand\\". In \\"Paranormal\\", the camera is put down, conversations happen out of frame, and all to good effect.<br /><br />Using unknown actors in a film like this helps make it more believable. I couldn't believe some reports I read that Hollywood was considering a remake using \\"named\\" actors. The trouble is, they'd have ruined it because, for some reason, they feel the need to \\"show\\" rather than \\"tell\\". Movies such as \\"The Haunting\\" remake are very obvious proof of this.<br /><br />I'm very glad this film was released \\"as is\\". It's surprisingly easy to suspend belief and get caught up in the atmosphere. I've never been so frightened, and I don't scare easily. Perhaps it was because of a theater full of people who gasped aloud when I did.<br /><br />We all bought it for an hour and a half.<br /><br />I hope that there are more true \\"independent\\" movies like this to come,where the art of film-making is not secondary to effects and big budgets.<br /><br />If you want a good fright, then go and see \\"Paranormal Activities\\"...and take some clean underwear.d fright, then go and see \\"Paranormal Activities\\"...and take some clean underwear.
1601251831|5.0|Following the release of the [[ASIN:1601251505 Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Core Rulebook]] Paizo comes up with the Bestiary. Since the Pathfinder is a refreshed, upgraded D&D 3.5, there was no question that the Monster Manual needs an update as well.<br /><br />===PRESENTATION===<br /><br />A solid sewn hardcover book with over 320 pages in full color. As usual, the artwork and layout is above and beyond. Paizo books have their unique art style, and it shows. There are several navigational aids, including indexes and CR tables. The book is a pleasure to look at and use.<br /><br />===CONTENT===<br /><br />The Pathfinder Bestiary offers circa 350 monsters for use in Pathfinder games. A quick glance at the index shows that the vast majority of monsters from 3.5 Monster Manual are here. Several are missing, be them either intellectual property of WotC (beholders, mind flayers, giths, displacer beasts, carrion crawlers, kuo-toa) or left out as particularly unpopular (tojanida, delver).<br /><br />However, there are also monsters not found in the original MM - among others such fantasy classics as Cyclopi, Giant Slugs and Sea Serpents. A few classic D&D monsters, made open content via [[ASIN:B000H19R9M Tome of Horrors]] are here as well - Vegepygmies, Dark Creepers and Shadow Demons, to name a few.<br /><br />Curiously, the fantasy classic Hippogrifs are missing, likely an oversight.<br /><br />The monsters are presented in 1 page = 1 monster format, making the book far easier to use than the 3.5 MM. All the critters received a major refurbishing, with vital stats adjusted for the new rules. In a few cases, the upgrade fixed major 3.5 errors with monsters such as Rakshasa, Ogre Magi or the Undead in general.<br /><br />However the biggest changes lie with the streamlining of monster use for the DMs. A vast number of generic monster rules were lifted out of the statblocks and placed in a convenient chapter called \\"universal monster rules\\", meaning that rules such as Improved Grab are no longer reprinted in several places across the book. The monster advancement rules - a major pain in 3.5 - were reworked as well, with an extensive chapter on \\"beefing up\\" the printed monsters.<br /><br />A monster creation chapter is present as well, with advice on creating new critters from the scratch.<br /><br />The Paizo design team made a controversial decision of removing the LA and ECL mechanics, stating that the book is a DM's monster book and that the \\"monsters for players\\" rules belong somewhere else. There is a short chapter on playing the monster races, but fans of monstrous heroes should be warned that Pathfinder doesn't focus on the idea nearly as much as 3.5 did.<br /><br />===CONCLUSION===<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best fantasy bestiaries out there. With outstanding art, evocative flavor text and solid rules upgrade, this is a great purchase for both Pathfinder and 3.5 players.<br /><br />PS: Several additional monsters are available in the [[ASIN:B002GVS8TQ Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bonus Bestiary (Pathfinder)]] which complements the Bestiary.ook.

B001AX9DT0|5.0|This is Ray's best album, in my opinion. I know \\"Trouble\\" was a favorite, but give this a few years and I think we will see that these songs will hold just as strong. Not many people know about Ray which is a shame, because he is in my opinion the best talent in the music industry today. My girlfriend and I went to see him in Philly earlier this year and fell in love at that show. My advice is to get a few Ray songs and you will see just what we all mean when we say is songs are timeless... The one thing we want to know about is more of the meating with Ray and Meg White... just what went on there... did they have a jam session where they played some music or was it just a cup of coffee and conversation?

B000GFLE1S|4.0|I've heard of this film for a while now, but up until recently I had yet to actually watch it. The name kept popping up in my mind because hey, it's an awesome title. I just wasn't sure if I'd actually like it or not. I like indie films, but I kind of have to be in the mood for them.<br /><br />The film follows two different people- Charlie & Lola. Charlie is drawn back to his father's failing shoe factory after his dad's death & Lola is a drag queen performer who spends nights performing in a local cabaret. When Charlie meets Lola after attempting her to rescue her from some ne'er do wells, he at first assumes that it is the end of their interaction. It's not until a spunky co-worker suggests that Charlie try to find a new niche market to cater for, that Charlie starts thinking about designing boots for male transvestites.<br /><br />I really did like this movie, but then I figured that I would. It's got two of my favorite British actors in it- Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead) & Jemima Rooper (Hex, Lost in Austen). The performances in the film were very good, but I have to say that it's really the whole ensemble that brings the film together. The main characters work very hard, but Nick & Jemima really do shine in this film. I love that this was a true story- it made the film so much more enjoyable knowing that it was based on real events. The only thing is that occasionally the film did sort of drag at times & felt a little bit like it was \\"paint-by-numbers feel good movie\\".<br /><br />This isn't going to take the place of my favorite movie 'Julie Newmar', but it's going to be one that I'll watch again.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|From the start, I was tapping my toes and grooving away in my cinema seat. It's truly a pity he didn't live to perform this concert because the creativity that he poured into every minute aspect of the show from background video footage, to costume, choreography, selecting his dancers, etc. just had me in awe. Decades on, his lyrics are as timely today as they were then, and in fact, so much before their time even. The respect from people who worked with and around him was obvious in this movie. You have seen nothing until you see what went into presenting each song. Superb!
B002S0OBFU|2.0|I love the types of horror films that build up the suspense in a film. I love it when the only things you see & hear are slight shadows or knocking sounds. I liked the first Blair Witch film. So by all accounts, I really should've liked this film. But I didn't. I know that I'm going to get tons of negatives from this review because hey... some people don't like it when others don't share their viewpoints. (And I don't feel like I should have to write a fake review just to get people to agree with me.)<br /><br />And if you are wondering, I generally don't like the films that are all blood & cheap spooks. I also didn't get a lot of the big media hoopla surrounding this film- the majority of what I'd heard about the film came from word of mouth from my friends & acquaintances. So it's not like I'm the type of person who only watches slasher films & it's not like I went into the film expecting this to be the 'Citizen Kane' of horror films.<br /><br />The film follows Katie, a young student who has been followed around by an unseen presence since she was young. Her day trader boyfriend Micah treats her story with amusement & mostly disbelief. He decides to purchase a video camera & record the strange goings on that have started to happen in their ordinary home. As the nights progress, the occurrences become more & more pronounced.<br /><br />I went into this film expecting to be entertained. I liked Blair Witch, so I figured that I'd be able to enjoy this film for the most part. I just didn't like most of the film. Why didn't I like it while so many others obviously did? Who knows? I saw this film with my mother, who describes herself as the most skittish person on earth & even she thought that this film was like watching paint dry on a wall.<br /><br />The first thing that made me a little disinterested is that there's not a whole lot of personality to either Micah or Katie. We see them go about some daily activities, yet there's just not a whole lot of zing to them. I'm not expecting a Michael Bay explosion or for the lead actress to burst into the room wearing something out of a Victoria Secret's catalog, but I do expect slightly more than this. Perhaps that's why I just didn't connect with everything as much- I just really didn't care that overly much about the characters. I know that this was to show that they were normal people & to show their mental deterioration as the events escalated, but I just couldn't really get into either character.<br /><br />The one thing I can say in defense of the film is that towards the end, the film did get better as the paranormal phenomenon got more pronounced & the script started picking up. The ending is pretty interesting, but it just didn't feel like it was worth sitting through the rest of the film for. It certainly wasn't worth the money it would cost to see in the theaters. The camera's shakiness wasn't as bad as it was in the Blair Witch film, but it still was bad enough to give me a pretty bad headache by the film's end.<br /><br />But this is just my opinion. I've talked to a few people who really did enjoy this film & more power to them. I'm glad that they liked it. I just wish that I had. I was just incredibly bored by this film. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch it, but I do recommend that most wait to see it when it comes out for rental with the alternate endings on it. (I'm assuming that they'll put them on the DVD, anyway.) In the meantime, I recommend some of the older classics out there such as 'The Changeling' & 'The Haunting' (the original one, not the remake). Those are films that build up the suspense slowly & really deliver. This film? I can safely say that I'll probably not rent it when it comes out or watch it again.xplosion or for the lead actress to burst into the room wearing something out of a Victoria Secret's catalog, but I do expect slightly more than this.

B00005JKHP|1.0|\\"What?\\", you might be asking.  \\"This isn't the worst.  `Final Frontier' is the worst\\".  No, with all due respact, you're wrong and I'll tell you why.  Final Frontier had a plot.  It wasn't a good plot, but it was a plot nonetheless.  A plot is something that this movie did not have.  When I heard they were rebooting the Star Trek franchise, I sat down and watched all the previously made Star Trek movies.  All but this one.  I sat through \\"Final Frontier\\", Insurrection\\", and even \\"Nemesis\\".  I absolutely refused to subject myself to this movie again.   I first saw this movie when I was eleven.  I had already seen a few of the other Star Trek movies.  I watched them out of order.  People had warned me that this one was horrible and boring, but I sat through it anyway.  A horrible decision on my part.  This is not just the worst Star Trek movie.  This is the number one worst movie I've seen in my entire life.  I would put this in the same category as movies like \\"Batman and Robin\\" and \\"Battlefield Earth\\".  I'm serious.  I think this is worse than those movies.  Again, those movies had plots.  Bad plots, but plots.  This movie has no plot.  All they did here is take actors from the television show, in character, put them up on the big screen, and call it a movie.  All they wanted to do here is cash in on a franchise that is considered by many (not me) to be classic.   Here is a brief summary of the movie.  A cloud thing is destroying ships and stuff.  Kirk, who is now an Admiral, takes over command of the Enterprise from Captian Willard Decker.  Decker is unhappy about this.  The Enterprise goes out to try to stop the blue cloud.  They make it inside the blue cloud, and Willard's ex-girlfriend gets taken by the blue cloud.  A being that looks like the ex comes to Enterprise and says that the cloud is called v'ger.  Um, okay.  Spock tries to mind-meld with v'ger, but gets electrocuted.  Spock then concludes that \\"v'ger is a child\\".  Um, okay.  Kirk , Spock, Decker, and Ithink Mccoy go outside the ship and see that v'ger is really Voyager six, a probe launched by earth back in the 20th century.  The ex-lady says that the creator of v'ger, a human, must join with v'ger.  Um, okay.  Willard offers himself, and joins with his ex and the satellite.  This creates a new life, or something.  The galaxy is again safe.   There.  It took me five minutes to go through a plot that took roughly two and a half hours to play out onscreen.  This isn't enough plot for a movie.  It's a long, long episode.  And a stupid, cheesy, campy, full-of-itself episode, at that.  I think this movie perfectly captured the essence of the 60s television series.  Oh, in addition to hating this movie, I also hate the old televison show, too.  Despite this, there was and still is a huge cult following for the show, despite it's horrible ratings.  The creators of this movie knew that.  They weren't interested in making a good movie.  They just wanted to cash in on a popular franchise.  You know how I know that?  They didn't make an ending for this movie until the last minute.  I would have loved to be at one of the writing meetings.

B0000683DH|5.0|This movie flat out rocks.  I mean it is awesome.  Star Trek the Motion Picture was a critical failure, garbage pile that it was, but a financial success.  The studio decided to try making one more movie, with a much lower budget.  They didn't let Gene Roddenberry have much involvement with this project, which is probably a good thing.  They hired Nicholas Meyer to direct this movie, who had no knowledge of Star Trek.  He watched the entire original series, and particularly liked the episode \\"Space Seed.\\"  This episode features the first appearance of Khan Nooien Singh, and is one of the only episodes of the series that I liked.  He decided to make Khan the primary villian of the sequel.  When the film was released, it was a huge success, critically and financially.  It is still considered by some to be the best Star Trek movie of all time, even better than the 2009 reboot.   The movie starts out with Admiral Kirk on an inspection of the Enterprise.  Spock is now captain of the Enterprise.  Kirk is longing for the days of years past when he was captain, and is getting depressed in his old age.  Chekov...I hate Chekov...is the first officer on the Reliant, a science vessel which is conducting tests on a new piece of technology, the Genesis torpedo.  It has the power to \\"create life from lifelessness\\".  They are trying to find a completely dead planet to test it on.  They explore the planet Ceti Alpha Five, and find Khan there.  He captures Chekov and the captain of Reliant, and sets out to obtain Genesis.  He also wants to find and kill Kirk, who he blames for the death of his wife.  Marla Mcgivens, the dumb chick from Space Seed, who fell in love with Khan.  Khan attacks and severly criples Enterprise, but they are able to fight him off.  Then Kirk and a few others beam to the Genesis space station.  They discover Carol Marcus, Kirk's old girlfriend, and their son, David.  Khan tries again to kill Kirk, but is unsuccessful.  He decides to leave Kirk on the planet to die.  However, Enterprise beams them back on board.  They engage Reliant in a spectacular battle, and Enterprise gets the upper hand.  However, Khan sets off the Genesis torpedo, crazed in his attempt to kill Kirk.  Enterprise's warp drive is busted, so Spock goes into a room with radiation in it and fixes the problem.  He sacrifices himself to save the Enterprise, which is able to escape just in time.  Although Khan is dead, he had inadvertantly succeeded in hurting Kirk by killing his friend  The torpedo creates a luscious, livable planet out of the dead moon by the station.  Kirk loads Spock's body into a torpedo tube and shoots him out onto the Genesis planet.  He then contemplates that if Genesis is capable of producing life, then maybe it can revive Spock.   Again, this movie is awesome.  It has one of the best villians in the Star Trek cannon, (I don't want to say best, because I've heard that the bad guy on Deep Space Nine is the best) it has visuals which were pretty good for the 1980s, and it set the stage for much more Star Trek.  With the success of this movie, they made more sequels, and eventually four more Star Trek television shows.  If they hadn't done such an outstanding job on this movie, Star Trek would probably have ended back then.  If you have never seen this movie, or you've never seen Star Trek at all, buy this movie anyway.  It's that good.     When I first saw this movie, I thought it was good , but not great.  That is, until I saw the TOS episode Space Seed.  Before watching this movie, watch this episode.  I've posted a link to it below.
1402714580|5.0|The last time I read \\"Little Women,\\" I must have been somewhere between the ages of 10 and 12.  I'm now almost 70.  The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again.  And I'm so glad.  First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story.  I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter).  The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time.  I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.<br /><br />That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful.  I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now.  At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face.  Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word.  Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities.  Visions of them run through my head as I read.  They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship.  Someone said to me the other day that it is a real tragedy that this story has been read primarily by girls.  We girls want everyone to know the story of the \\"Little Women.\\"
0385504225|1.0|I felt like hours of my time were wasted when I read the ending of this book.  People died in the story line for such an obvious non secret - really, is there nothing else for Dan Brown to write about than perhaps he should take a break from writing!  What a disappointment.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|I am a huge fan of Paul McCartney and The Beatles but Electric Arguments is not for the average Paul McCartney fan.  I recall seeing Paul a few years ago in concert in Boston with a bizzare opening that had this CD's type of songs.  There are a few rockers but mostly a mellow CD.

141041986X|4.0|So this is what keeps troubling me about the book: as an adult reader, I cannot decide if this is merely a guilty pleasure, or a book with substance that, as the cover says, \\"explores the effects of war and violence on those coming of age.\\"  Professional reviewers and Amazon reviewers alike seem to agree that the book has a political angle, and the inside cover goes so far as to say that it combines \\"suspense and philosophy.\\"  To which I can only say.... if that is true, then it is certainly philosophy-lite, even for a YA novel.  I will, however, grant that it does have \\"unsettling parallels to our present.\\"     The reason that I feel so ambivalent about it is that it is such a gripping and suspenseful read; it truly is difficult to put down.  But it is so in a way that reminds me of a video game: different opponents, each with specific abilities; changing settings which present new obstacles and hazards; a limited life-line buttressed with revitalizing finds or gifts.  Indeed, it's called \\"The Hunger Games\\"---duh, right?  And yet something about all of this bothers me.      It's structured like your standard voyage and return narrative, with many elements of the hero's quest.  But in this book there is no Grail, no Dragon.   The reward is simply your life, and the villains are merely pawns like the protagonist.  This lowers the stakes and even calls into doubt the idea of heroism.  Is fighting for your life heroic?  I tend to see self-defense as something very different from heroism.      The real evildoers are, of course, the game makers and the society which permits this atrocity to take place, but this aspect is never really developed (at least there is no climactic confrontation, and not much of a build up to one either).      True: the reader cannot help but to feel disgust for the game makers. True: one is appalled by the extent to which the media forces people to create a false persona and to live a lie.  But that is really the extent of the social commentary, and I felt like some opportunities were lost.  Ultimately, I found myself asking: Is this enough?      You want the characters to live (they are, after all, archetypes, and hence parts of us all---the courageous, the doomed, the saved).  But saying that the Roman Games are wrong as you sit down to watch the gladiators as they are thrown to the lions is not a critique, and shouldn't make us feel any less guilty about watching.  In the end, are we the readers just as bad as the spectators in the book?  If so, then we've been duped.  And I don't think this was Collins' intention.
0385504225|3.0|I was disappointed with Dan Brown . I would title his book \\"Much ado about nothing\\" He creates an incredible monster who achieves nothing, seems pointless and who eventually peters out in bizarr circumstances.  The ancient Masonic symbol,central to this plot/story really turns out to be much ado about nothing also. So as a novel with suspence ,intrigue and a satisfying conclusion this mystery novel failed.I will give credit to Dan Brown for his knowledge on Masonic practises and the layuot of Washington D.C
0395754100|5.0|My kids love this lovely classic and everyday they beg me to read with them.Especially when I read about how Curious George learned the alphabets in a different way,Wow! That's great.

0312370849|5.0|I could not put this book down and I read the book in one weekend.  I alway enjoy reading a book and learning somthing new.  In this I book learned of the French round up of Jews and the horrors of living in Paris during the war.  My husbands Jewish grandparents hid in the countryside around Paris during this time and I wish they were still alive to talk about this event. The character in the title 'Sarah' has a wonderful clear voice in the book. Another important character Julie does not quite fit the story.  This character Julie in another story would spoil the book but here I tolerated her in order for the author to bring the story into current times, contrived but worked for me.

B002PXKWQ2|5.0|I am usually a bit weary of digital remasters of original analogue recordings, but this one has been executed very well. The sound is still there in all its analogue splendor, but the dynamics have been turned up a notch. Especially the last part of the main track has gained an immense level of depth--the bit where almost all the synthesizers drop out, leaving only the electronic percussion, makes my heart skip even more than before. Well done!
0307473473|3.0|We read this book in our book club this past month.  My husband read it first and said if you can get<br />past the first 40 pages of alot of names, details, etc. then it is a fantastic book.  I however found<br />the print to be very small and hard on the eyes.  It didn't grip me however I am not a history buff<br />and this was just too long of a book for me.  Everyone else I know really liked it.
159448385X|4.0|I read The Kite Runner first, based primarily on the reviews I saw on this website. Most people seemed to agree The Kite Runner is excellent. I agree - it is one of the best books I have ever read. Then I read A Thousand Splendid Suns. I will admit I was skeptical about it, because I could not imagine a book being better than The Kite Runner. Maybe my expectations were too high, because I did enjoy this book, but not as much as The Kite Runner. What I enjoyed about Splendid Suns is the historical perspective that is provided over the course of many years; I felt like I gained a better understanding of how Afghanistan has changed and struggled over time. It was heartbreaking to learn the plight of Afghan women and all they endure just to survive. The Kite Runner provided a better glimpse into human nature and how, no matter where we live, emotions are the same. I felt like I could connect better with the story line of Kite Runner. I seem to recall it is written in first person, rather than third person as in Splendid Suns. Both are must-reads, with an edge given to Kite Runner.
0446698342|5.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan. I have many of his books and find him to be a wonderful writer. I was very excited to get my copy of The Lucky One! And once again he delivered!

B000OCXMAE|5.0|i would say looking at my previous collection of Linkin, i am somewhat a fan. However i lost touch with them till this album came around.  I must say these guys have matured up as artist over the years.  This era of an album reminds me so much of U2's Joshua tree from the 80's. It has heart and you feel there is good continuity between all tracks! Not to mention several of their tracks got picked up by movie scores. I think they will continue to grow.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Fact:  The stunning reaction to the mono set took nearly everyone by surprise.<br />Fiction:  You made the wrong choice by buying the stereo set.<br /><br />Fact:  The vocals/instruments separation in some of the stereo albums is wider than the actual crosswalk shown on the Abbey Road cover.<br />Fiction:  You made the wrong choice by buying the stereo set.<br /><br />Fact:  The mono set's enthusiasts' reviews have a lot of merit and are based on more than mere nostalgia.<br />Fiction:  You made the wrong choice by buying the stereo set.<br /><br />Being a 57-year-old Beatles fan has its advantages, not the least of which is having some perspective on the two current remastered sets from EMI.  (By the way, I bought from Amazon the individual stereo CDs -- except for the YS soundtrack -- at low prices and applied the money I saved toward the mono box set, which I had intended to get all along.)<br /><br />I don't consider myself a Beatles completist.  Still, at one time or another over the years I have had and embraced the original Vee-Jay, Swan, and Capitol mono 45s; nearly all the mono and stereo albums from Capitol (the stereo versions of which I had rebought at least twice by 1980); various British, German, and other European imports (mono and/or stereo, depending on the album); reissued British (mono) EPs on vinyl; all the 1987 EMI compact discs; the three \\"Anthology\\" sets; the \\"YS Songtrack,\\" \\"1\\", and \\"Let It Be...Naked\\"; the Capitol box sets from a few years ago (which I really like); and now these terrific EMI remasters.  And while I have never bought any Beatles bootleg CDs, over the years I have listened to other fans' exhaustive box sets of the \\"Let It Be\\" sessions and the BBC sessions, all kinds of live shows from around the world, and other entries in the band's unofficial output.<br /><br />I mention this not in an attempt to impress anyone.  There are many of you out there who have heard and own far more Beatles music than I ever have or ever will.  But it underscores (1) the substantial amount of music the boys created in a short span of time; (2) the seemingly countless formats and mix variations -- some subtle, some striking -- of specific songs and of the albums themselves despite there being just \\"a\\" mono mix and just \\"a\\" stereo mix; and (3) the soul connection I have to this body of music.  I wish I had experienced one of their live concerts during Beatlemania.  But in early December of 1963 I did whip my head around at the dinner table to catch the CBS Evening News report on the growing Beatles phenomenon in Great Britain.  That was my first clue.  A month later, my mom and I watched a segment on the Beatles that the wry Jack Paar aired on his Friday night TV show in January 1964.  And my folks, my kid brother, my grandparents, and I watched the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964.  I was hooked.<br /><br />I should also point out that I'm not an audiophile; my whole sound system didn't cost me more than $3,000.  That won't buy speaker wire in some high-end systems.  But an actual audiophile (a guy half my age whose expertise and opinions I truly respect) helped me configure my listening room so that my 4-speaker system helps deliver warmth, clarity, presence, and punch whether the music is presented in mono or stereo and regardless of what kind of music it is.<br /><br />I have listened to these 2009 remasters a lot in the past couple of months.  Oh, I mixed in some Byrds and Beach Boys, some blues and jazz, and some country and folk here and there.  But I have focused on these remasters.<br /><br />Overall, I prefer the stereo mixes.  And I'm not a stereo-only proponent anymore than I am a mono-is-best proponent.  But I like the way the electric guitars ring and chime (especially George's Ric 12-string, which inspired another of my R&R heroes, Roger McGuinn) and the way the acoustic guitars hum.  I like how Ringo -- one of my all-time favorite rock drummers -- cracks and thumps his drums.  I like how Paul's bass lines, too often buried in the mix in previous vinyl and CD incarnations, prove once and for all just how good the guy was all along.  I like how John's rhythm guitar sounds and how his vocal inflections emerge. Most of all, I like how those tight harmonies, whether they're based on the Everly Brothers' vocal arrangements or something the boys and George Martin created from scratch, fill this room.  These stereo remasters make this very familiar music sound so fresh and vibrant and clear that I want to buy a round of drinks for the team of engineering professionals who spent four years of their lives to give us this Digital Age treasure-trove.<br /><br />That said, I do like several of the mono mixes nearly as much and maybe more.  Sgt. Pepper is thrilling to hear in its mono presentation.  It really is.  It's different enough from the stereo mix to draw my wife in from another room to exclaim, \\"I don't remember THAT being on there!\\"  Another mono mix which arguably tops its stereo counterpart is Please Please Me.  This seminal Beatles long-player has never sounded so good.  Plus, like its 1987 EMI precursor, the title track -- my favorite of the band's early rockers along with \\"Twist And Shout\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" -- is the version that's free of the fluffed vocals on the last verse.  That alone was going to ensure I'd be buying the mono box set in addition to the stereo remasters.  \\"Anna,\\" \\"There's A Place,\\" \\"Love Me Do\\" -- these and other tracks also sound great in mono.  (I'm not sure any degree of remastering will spur me to like \\"Ask Me Why,\\" with its \\"woo-woo-woo-woo\\" and \\"I-I-I-I\\" refrains, but that's just me.)<br /><br />The mono remasters of With The Beatles and Beatles For Sale are also top-notch.  (Though, again, new and improved sound still won't compel me to listen to \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" on a regular basis.) And, The Beatles (the \\"White Album\\") in mono is different enough from its stereo counterpart (and so rock-solid) that it too warrants a favorable comparison.<br /><br />Still, the stereo mixes overall will remain the versions I most often pop into my CD player.  They are exhilarating to listen to.  So, if you bought the stereo set but have been mentally kicking yourself after having read all the rave reviews of the mono mixes, please know that you chose wisely.  You really did.  If your curiosity about the mono set hasn't subsided and you can afford to get it, do so.  There are enough differences between the two mixes -- beyond their obvious channel separation -- that you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the talent and energy that went into creating each mix back in the day.  But -- and this is my one big caution to you -- if you're unaccustomed to listening to classic rock and pop music in mono, you may find it a bit of a jolt to your senses.  To your ears, mono Beatles music may indeed sound \\"muddy,\\" \\"flat,\\" and \\"dead\\" as termed by some fans who've posted reviews in one or both of the two box set forums.  Personally I enjoy both mixes being offered in these 2009 remasters.  That's because regardless of the artist or the genre of music we're talking about, mono and stereo mixes have both been part of my listening experience since I was a little kid back in the late 1950s.  But that may not be true for you; your experience may be based more on one or the other. And so, as much as I dig the mono PPM and mono Sgt. Pepper, as much of a kick as I get from hearing both the subtle and dramatic differences between all the songs and albums presented in both mixes, these great-sounding stereo discs have now formed the core of my Beatles collection.<br /><br />Ultimately, YOUR tastes and YOUR preferences are all that matter.  Not my take on \\"mono vs. stereo\\" and not anyone else's.  The fact that you are passionate about the music the boys and Sir George created all those years ago is reason enough to rejoice that you and I and millions of other Beatle people the world over finally have these dynamic remasters.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This movie was very nicely done, just like director Ortega says \\"For The Fans\\".  Michael Jackson was a great talent that will indeed be missed.  In this movie you will again get to see his captivating power and beauty of his soul and his music that made so many people become his fans.  This movie was not made like a documentary.  It was made more like trying to develop a DVD out of the real concert that was to be \\"This is It\\".  The concert, unfortunately, never got to see the light of day, therefore, this is the next best thing.  And it is the best!  The movie follows song after song, just like songs would be sung in the concert, and Michael sings his songs fully, in their entirety, even though this was just rehearsal.  There are spectacular effects and so much energy generated by Michael and the dancers.  There are some small commentaries in between the songs, and a little bit of interviewing here and there.  There is funny discussion between Michael and the director or the musicians at times.  And for some of the songs, he doesn't sing a few words in a verse, but of course, it was only rehearsal.  And for only a rehearsal, this movie is actually great.  He sings his songs as if they are sung in the studio, not live.  He always aimed for perfection.  And it was this perfection that consumed him too soon and took him away in the end.  But he will always be remembered in our hearts!  And for those who were never hard-core fans, like me, but only appreciated him for the entertainer that he was, I think after seeing this movie you will regret you were never a fan.  But it's never too late.  He still lives, in our minds and hearts, and his music will live forever in this world and maybe beyond.  A lot of us will realize only now what great human being Michael Jackson was...  See this movie, buy the DVD, enjoy his music and remember him...

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This product includes a Blu-ray disk and a DVD.  We do not yet have a Blu-ray player, so I can just comment on the DVD.  I have 2 kids who were born after Snow White went into the \\"vault\\" last time.  Thus, the only copy we had was a VHS.  The sound on that VHS was awful.  The color and picture on the video are more intense and the sound is significantly crisper compared to the old VHS version.<br /><br />As for the movie, created in 1939, Snow White is amazing.  Every time I see it, I am blown away by Walt Disney's genius.  Snow White is different from other princesses in that her hair is styled in a short 1930s style and her singing voice is definitely more high pitched compared to the later princesses.  She also seems to be younger - no age is given for her, but it seems like she is 13 or so.<br /><br />The movie is rather violent - a young child could potentially be scared by the Queen's desire for the hunter to \\"cut out Snow White's heart\\" and the images of Snow White fleeing into the dark forest.  The Queen's convesion into a witch may be frightening too, as might the morbid concept of Snow White laying in a glass coffin, presumably dead.  Parents should be aware that the movie is rather morbid.  My daughter was frightened the first time she saw it a few years ago but she is mesmerized by the movie.  The scariness is balanced by the delightful dwarves and Snow White's sweet naivete.  The movie provides a great lesson on talking to strangers.<br /><br />Snow White is generally faithful to the original fairy tale, except Snow White is offered only the poison apple.  In the fairy tale, Snow White is offered a poison comb and one other poison object before the apple.  And, like the other Disney Princess movies to follow, Snow White can communicate with animals.<br /><br />Fantastic movie, a bit dated.  The DVD is a great improvement, at least over my prior VHS version.
0307473465|2.0|The Reader is not a book I would ever have chosen to read. The only reason I took it up was because two of my Spanish teacher colleagues had asked me, a German teacher, to give my opinion about the ending, since they had each come away with a different interpretation. (MAJOR SPOILERS COMING!) So I read the book as a favor to them, having absolutely no idea in advance what the story was about.        For the first third of the book the review I was planning was negative. It seemed to me basically a sex book dressed up in literary pretentiousness. The novel takes place in West Germany (the Heidelberg area), starting in 1959 and spans a period of over 30 years. The story is told from the viewpoint of the main character, Michael Berg, and opens with his seduction as a fifteen-year-old high school student by streetcar conductor Hanna, a woman whose name he doesn't even know and who is in her thirties. On the one hand the relationship borders on morally repugnant. Had the roles been reversed--had a thirty-year-old-man seduced a fifteen-year-old girl and the first third of the book been devoted to a frank description of their sexual relationship--the novel may never have gotten published in America. But realistically, the author is male and what he has written is a fantasy that most young men have had; and our culture seems to find that acceptable. On the other hand, the relationship between Michael and Hanna is a destructive one. Both are using the other strictly for their own pleasure. Or at least for their own interests. But not out of a regard for the other, and certainly not out of love, even though young Michael mistakes his lustful infatuation for love and mistakes Hanna's attentions for love.       The interesting twist in Michael and Hanna's otherwise twisted relationship is their post-coital activity. Michael, on a college preparatory track, begins reading Hanna the books he's required to read for school. They are classics of German and European literature: Emilia Galotti, Kabala und Liebe, Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts, War and Peace, The Odyssey. It's true that the reason Michael reads aloud to Hanna at all forms an integral part of the story's plot, and it's not even clear to Michael until he is much older what it meant that he read aloud to her. However, I felt the choice of novels mentioned was intended to lend this part of the story a literary veneer, and I can't help but believing that the reader would be better off skipping this book and reading the works alluded to themselves.       It isn't until the novel's second act that the plot really takes off. Michael, now an aimless law student, attends the trial of several women who had been guards at a concentration camp during the war. The women are accused of being responsible for the deaths of a group of Jewish women on a death march while fleeing the advance of Allied forces at the end of the war. Michael is shocked to recognize Hanna among the defendants. She had disappeared mysteriously after their relationship was about a year old, and Michael had had no contact with her since. Adding to Michael's confusion at seeing his former lover on trial for Nazi war crimes is Hanna's bizarre, belligerent, seemingly inexplicable behavior in the courtroom.        It wasn't until the late 1960s that Germany began seriously coming to terms with the twelve year period of National Socialist rule--not just coming to terms with the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also with the actions of the adult populace at large during that period of time. This introspection was lead by the children of those adults and corresponded with the student protest movement of the late 60s, which was very much a reaction against the existing authority structures in society. Therefore the introspection took the form of a condemnatory stance against most of the previous generation, which was held--by its actions or by its silence--to be complicit with the evils perpetrated by the Nazis. They tended to blame everyone in their parents' generation out of horror at the sheer magnitude and inhumanity of the crimes. It was this same reaction among the British and Americans that led to the retributive leveling of Dresden during the waning weeks of the war. Michael's struggle to reconcile the woman who had treated him at times so tenderly with the woman accused of leading the others in the brutal death of helpless prisoners mirrors the struggle of his generation.       The nature of the writing improved as the novel progressed. The young Michael posed a myriad of questions which he didn't bother to try and answer, and at first I understood this as a pretentious attempt at art. I don't find the endless stringing together of questions about the direction and meaning of one's life to be particularly literary, especially if no attempt is made to provide possible answers. It is the product of a culture that no longer feels there are answers because it has lost faith in the Truth. Yet as he ages, Michael not only continues to pose questions but also attempts answers, subtly implying that there must be Truth out there, or else we would not continue to seek it. I came to appreciate the author's attempt to show the narrator's development over time from a sheltered, provincial adolescent to an experienced man of the world and veteran of multiple failed relationships and one failed marriage. But since the whole story is told as a retrospective from one point in time, it would seem that the aged Michael Berg would be as adept at handling the questions he asked as a teenager, as he is at handling the questions he asks as an adult.       The best written chapter of the novel is the fourth chapter of the second act. In it Michael describes a \\"numbness\\" which has taken over everyone in the courtroom as the case drags on. \\"It had taken hold not only of the perpetrators and victims, but of all of us, judges and lay members of the court, prosecutors and recorders, who had to deal withthese events now; when I likened perpetrators, victims, the dead, the living, survivors, and their descendants to each other, I didn't feel good about it and I still don't.\\" The author is at his best when trying to find the balance between acknowledging the humanity of the perpetrators and condemning the crimes that were committed. It is something that Germans have a hard time with. A few years ago when the movie Downfall appeared, detailing the final weeks in Hitler's bunker, it met with a great deal of criticism for putting too much of a human face on Adolf Hitler. For many he must be a monster without any humanity at all; that way he can be an anomaly. If he were human--and enjoyed pleasure and suffered pain and had doubts and loved--then he was like the rest of us, and that doesn't say as much about Hitler as it does about the rest of us and what we may be capable of.   \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it. But it was too terrible for that. When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned. When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding. But even as I wanted to understand Hanna, failing to understand her meant betraying her all over again. I could not resolve this. I wanted to pose myself both tasks--understanding and condemnation. But it was impossible to do both.\\" This is one of the best explanations of the conflict that the post-war generation was faced with. Condemning and understanding seeming to be mutually exclusive. It might not necessarily be good art, but it's good writing.       In the end Hanna is sentenced to a greater prison term than she (legally) deserves, because she is loath to disclose the fact that she is illiterate. It seems strange to the reader that the plot of the novel and the trajectory of Hanna's entire life hinges upon her illiteracy and a sense of pride that won't let it be revealed. The author recognizes this and goes to great length to have Michael explain to the reader why Hanna would rather let herself be unjustly sentenced rather than simply admit she couldn't read. It didn't really work with me; I just had to go with it and accept it, even though I couldn't really buy into it.        Then comes the end of the novel. For all of the years of Hanna's imprisonment Michael has been recording himself reading works of literature and mailing them to Hanna. As she is about to be paroled he agrees to be a care-taker for her upon her release. He has obtained an apartment and a job for her, has met with her, and she appears ready to begin life again. Yet the morning of her release she hangs herself. Why? A key might be provided by the warden of the prison. When asked by Michael how she had lived, the warden replies she had served out most of her time like a nun in a convent. But in the last few years she had let herself go to seed, even though she didn't seem unhappy. \\"'In fact, it was as though the retreat to the convent was no longer enough, as though life in the convent was still too sociable and talkative, and she had to retreat even further, into a lonely cell safe from all eyes, where looks, clothing, and smell meant nothing. No, it would be wrong to say that she had given up. She redefined her place in a way that was right for her, but no longer impressed the other women.'\\" It could be that Hanna realized she would not be able to continue such a life on the outside. And if it's plausible that her pride would allow her to serve 18 years in prison rather than admit she was illiterate, then it's plausible it would cause her to end her life rather than leave prison. As Michael explains to the one surviving victim of Hanna's crime, Hanna did not want her years in prison to be merely the required atonement, she wanted to give her own meaning to her experiences. Again, I'm not sure that I can buy into the explanation; I just have to accept it for what it is. And one must accept thenovel for what it is: deeply problematic, but at times an articulate, well-worded explanation of an important chapter in German post-war history. Ultimately though, I'm stretching to be as positive as I have been.

B002TX06RI|5.0|I watched the premier on TV and loved it. My husband did also and he's hard to please. I watched it again on the PC and I want more. This is a very viable show with great actors that are well typed cast, the sets are excellent, and the stories great. I will be looking forward to many more seasons of this.
B002TX06RI|5.0|I originally watched this show with little interest because the main character, Bryce Larkin from Chuck, however he redeemed himself through this tv series. lookin forward to the future episodes.
B002TX06RI|5.0|To begin with, I'm not much of a fan of procedural type shows where cops solve cases episode by episode. White Collar kind of has that going on, but it does it EXTREMELY well. And I will tell you why!    1. GREAT actors. They're pretty awesome. Matthew Bomer and Tim DeKay are quite talented and make the characters of Neal and Peter very likable. All of the subtle things that Peter portrays on screen make him a cop you want to root for. They could easily be a pair of guys who bumble and fumble through cases and grate on each others (as well as our) nerves, but they have fantastic chemistry which makes the show both interesting and fun. Even Tiffani Thiessen (formerly known as Kelly Kapowski) does a great job of being the loving wife.     2. GREAT writing. The overall story is about Neal, a white collar criminal helping out FBI agent Peter solve cases in exchange for semi-freedom. Neal's deal is trying to find out what happened to his girlfriend while he was in jail. Sounds boring? The writers make sure that it's not. The week to week crime solving is also pretty good so far. As I said before, I don't like procedurals but I have been really liking White Collar so far.    If anything, give at least the pilot a watch. The characters could very easily be stereotypical and irritating and who knows what else, but fortunately they're fresh and fun.

B0027ZEHGO|1.0|I just caught this the other day on HBO, and it confirmed for me that Michael Moore is a major league Socialist. He certainly thinks that massive taxation and the government forcing people to live a limited standard of living is some sort of utopia. In essence, under European Socialism, you are expected to be happy with a place to live, and enough for transportation. He thinks this minimalist \\"that is good enough\\" way of life is better than it is in America. Doubtful.<br />His interview with a French family is portrayed so that they absolutely love the level of taxation they live under. To do this he shows they have a modest kitchen, a living room, and a cabinet with travel souvenirs. It looks like a place that is the size of a lower to mid middle class family would have in the US; except in France, that is as good as this family is going to have. A family like this could afford more in the US, and would have a private health insurance policy for a fraction of the taxes they give to the government every year.<br />And making it sound like government paid nannies and government paid college is such a great idea? Please. More forced stifling taxes, to subsidize a workforce so families can do less of the parenting. And government paid college has created a place where tens of thousands of young people linger for years and learn to become better Communists and Socialists through professor led marches and demonstrations over the most inane and stupid causes. No need to face the real world of work. Just hang out in collge until you are 29.<br />For the want to be American Socialist, the French approach may look like utopia, but it is not freedom like we have in the United States. Everything is controlled, measured, and programmed for limited and capped progression. It stifles the human spirit. It kills motivation, because there is in the end no reward. One has to (like this French family) convince yourself limited results of your labors is all the system will allow for.<br />Marx was wrong, Lenin was wrong, and so were Mau, Castro, and others like them. The decline of the USSR and other place of communism around the world are proof of that. The European watered down version of Socialism setteled upon by Hitler, Franco, Degaulle, and added to by every European prime minsiter since the Second World War is not blatant dictatorship today, but it is mind numbing limited life of immense tax burden.

B002LVVCIK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I think I know what Micheal Moore is trying to say. I was very impressed by the video of FDR explaining to the American people his additions to the current bill of rights. Michael is responsible for finding this \\"lost\\" video and good for him. Why has it never been shown before? Why was it hidden away? How could such a statement by such a great president ever get \\"lost\\"? Why do so few Americans know the labor history of America? If it is not possible for workers, owners and consumers all to profit in a socially beneficial way, then all our dreams are impossible.<br /><br />Surely FDR's second bill of rights is the direction in which our government should have been heading. These goals expressed by FDR are the American dream.  Instead of pursuing this American dream we got more war, hot and cold, and a bloated military industrial complex. What we have been experiencing since the end of World War II isn't even close to FDR's vision or Micheal's or mine.<br /><br />Greed does not work and crime should not pay. As capitalist we all love entrepreneurship, private property,individualism and the opportunity to become wealthy but not at the expense or exploitation of other human beings - here in our home country or abroad. These capitalist benefits that we all respect can be achieved along with decency and a moral code. These capitalist ideals do not have to encourage selfishness, exclusion, ghettos and poverty nor do they have to promote destructive competition or monopolization. Adam Smith did not teach that unscrupulous, criminals pursuing their criminal goals would be guided by God's invisible hand. Adam Smith was a moralist speaking out against monopolization and power. Today he would be challenging the same lack of business morals by the controllers and international monopolization, I have no doubt.<br /><br />Globalism is fine but not at the expense of our own people. Our nation's first obligation is to its people. Trading goods to the profit of a few Americans while sacrificing the livelihood of tens of thousands of Americans is pure insanity.

0307408833|1.0|The pics and editorials for this cookbook was so enticing that it sold me on the idea of sugar, dairy and gluten-free confections.  I spent $150 on only some very expensive, found-only-in-the-health-food store items necessary to bake cupcakes for a friend and spent an entire day paying extremely close attention to all the techniques and instructions for chocolate and carrot cupcakes.  The \\"frosting\\" would not gel until a full 24 hours later (too late) and looked nothing like that pictured. It had an unappealing shiny texture, like pureed soup and tasted like something that did not resemble real food.  The carrot cupcakes puffed up nicely in  the oven then plummeted with dents while cooling in the pan on the rack.  The chocolate cupcakes were soft and nicely formed, but hardened within two hours into dry, tasteless, sandy something-or-others.  No one at the health-conscious party even tried them and I and my husband, who do enjoy more health-conscious snacks, if not gluten-free, thought they were not worth eating as they did not satisfsy any craving for sweets - texture or otherwise.  In short, one would have to rearrange their expectations and be open to an entirely different experience of the idea of cupcakes.  I am giving the book and the ingredients away and going back to evaported cane or raw sugar, organic white flour/whole grain baking mixes, eggs and at least half butter.  I simply cannot imagine regular folks liking these cupcakes better than their unhealthy cousins.

B000XA5K48|4.0|This movie kept me laughing until the very end. Movies often employ dialogue to get laughs, but this is the first movie I've seen that uses pure action almost the whole way through. And it's not the cutesy little stunts done by screw-ups. No Ben Stillers falling on banana peels. No, this was bad ass hilarity. You should watch it knowing that you are watching a comedy though. If your sense of humor is a little slow on the uptake, you might end up being one of the reviewers that give this film only one star. But please save yourself the embarrassment, and don't do that.
B002H3F7F6|2.0|While there is something spectacular about Soul Cake, I found virtually all the rest of the 'songs' wanting. Seriously! I think this album speaks more to Sting's infatuation with himself than the attempt to be the male version of Norah Jones (he falls short). Now on the other hand Nora doing some of these songs...that might be something to listen to.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is by far an amazing production of his last performance. I was in such aw as I have always been whenever I saw him perform. He was so talented. He could sing and dance like no other. He was always such a kind and gentle person. He never pretended to be something he wasn't. He never seemed to act like he was better than anyone else.I also noticed that whenever you see him he never has jewelry on or very little. To me that show he's not trying to act like he is all that. He didn't need the bling. Some of the cloths he wore with the sparkle and glitter was all he needed. To me he was a real man who love to perform with the well chosen clothing for his performances. Even his outfits where classic. He was human nature.(And boy could he dance and sing) You usally see other famouse people always showing off with there bling, which to me is just not very tasteful. He was never all about that. He was just a GREAT performer. He didn't have to do all the yelling and cursing to become one of the best performers(and boy could he dance and sing) since Elvis. He was such a loving person.(And boy could he dance and sing) It is sad to know now how much he suffered in pain that he had to use pain killers and eventually became addicted to them. It saddens me to know how much pain he must have been in. Physically and mentally.  And how some people believed the false accusations made against him. It saddens me to this day to know that some of the people actually believed the accusations that were brought against him. I also still believe it was all about money, as it always is when someone doesn't want to work for themselves and wants a free ride in life. He loves people and he especially loved children. I  hope his children can carry on his legacy and know that they are one of the luckiest people in the world to have had a father who was such a great performer to share there lives with, and to have shared with us.   As I watched the performance I felt like I was at his concert. Ifelt the need to applaud as I watched. I also sang along with the songs. And at the same time I was choked up watching and knowing he is no longer with us and what a shame it is. I know I could have watched much more of it. I just didn't want it to end.  It is just such a shame  he had to leave us because of a fateful mistake. To me there is just no reason he should have had to go from us through the falt of the medication that was administered to him. I hope that the doctor has to face some kind of consiquence for his mistake. He being a physician should have know better. He administered to much different kinds of medicines in to short a period of time to Michael and he also should have know that what he was giving him  was to much especially for the weight that Michael was at. He didn't let enough hours pass between the medications administered. But poor Michael paid the ultimate price again. I pray he is resting in peace now.   But if you see no other movie this year. Let this be the one you make a point to go and see. I promise you you will not be sorry no matter what you even thought of him in the past.  \\"And Boy could he sing and dance.\\"  God Bless you all, as Michael would say.    xooxxoxxoxoxo
1416594787|5.0|When I first heard about Dawkins' new book on evolution, my first question was \\"Why?\\" After all, there have already been several books published in recent years that defend evolution against its critics- \\"Why Evolution is True,\\" Sean Carroll's books, Ken Miller's \\"Only a Theory,\\" several books on the Dover Trial, as well as anthologies of scientists writing essays against creationism. I was pleasantly surprised. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" (here on out to be abbreviated as TGSOE), is in a sense another book on evolution that continues the trend of a backlash of scientists against Intelligent Design, but it stands out because Dawkins uses his best talent, science writing, to not only argue the case for evolution but to reach out to those who are not already especially well-versed in biology to understand it. According to the author, in his previous science books, such as \\"Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" he simply assumed evolution was true, and felt that he needed a new book to explain why it is true, and because of the alarmingly high rate of non-acceptance of evolution in the United States.     TGHOE's first order of business is to explore the use of the word \\"theory.\\" \\"Evolution is only a theory\\" seems to be a ubiquitous phrase among its opponents these days, and Dawkins wants to dismantle the notion. He talks about how theory is understood:    \\"Theory, Sense 1: A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded oor accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed. Theory, Sense 2: A hypothesis proposed as an explanation; hence, a mere hypothesis, speculation, conjecture; an idea or set of ideas about something; an individual view or notion.  Obviously the two meanings are quite different from oneanother. And the short answer to my question about the theory of evolution is that the scientists are using Sense 1, while the creationists are- perhaps mischievously, perhaps sincerely- opting for Sense 2. A good example of Sense 1 is the Heliocentric Theory of the Solar System [or the Atomic Theory of Matter of the Theory of Gravity, etc], the theory that the Earth and the other planets orbit the sun. Evolution fits Sense 1 perfectly.\\" (p. 9) He goes on to note that, strictly speaking, only Mathematicians can prove things, with theorems. However, evolution is proved in the same sense that the Heliocentric Theory is proved. \\"Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of 'fact' seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution...Though logic choppers rule the town, some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.\\" (p. 10)     According to Dawkins, given all of this, and since the word theory in the context of evolution is so loaded with \\"Sense 2,\\" it's better to call it \\"The Fact of Evolution.\\" Will the strategy pay off? Since the cultural basis for creationism is so strong in the United States, it's hard to see how. Having said that, it may be worth a try. If different words and phrases can cause enough people to change their method of thinking, it may indeed have an impact.    Several other parts of TGSOE stood out for me: 1.) The analogy between artificial breeding and evolution by natural selection, and its relation to genetics. 2.) The discussion of barriers to understanding evolution, such as \\"essentialism\\" and \\"the Great Chain of Being,\\" 3.) The analogy of embryonic development to origami    Darwin realized by observing plant and animal husbandry that people can change species through selective breeding. This was nothing new, of course. But the insight he extrapolated was that species themselves were not immutable and that nature itself acted as the selecting agents. Inheriting genes, Dawkins says, is more like shuffling cards than blending two different kinds of paint together. So no descendant is going to be exactly like its ancestor. With enough \\"selection,\\" a particular species will change over time, as has happened with the domestication of many animals and plants. The same principle, that species are mutable and changeable, makes evolution by natural selection the next logical step- with nature as the selecting agent, we can get great diversity of life, given enough geographic variation.     Dawkins claims that \\"the dead hand of Plato,\\" which he also calls \\"essentialism,\\" is behind much of the confusion regarding evolution. There's the idea, going back to Plato, that there are ideal forms behind appearences; i.e., a perfect form of a rabbit behind rabbits. So many people think of different living things as somehow set, as in Platonic ideals. This is deeply unevolutionary. I agree, but I think that it's a mistake to blame this on Plato, because it doesn't explain why people who have never heard of Plato would want to be set in rigid categorization in the first place. Bruce Hood in Supersense makes a good case that the human brain naturally tends to classify objects, which will naturally make evolution hard to understand. With that aside, it's good for Dawkins to mention this. Species classification is something that biologists impose on themselves to explain the world- not absolute categories that exist \\"out there.\\" Related to essentialism is the problem of what Dawkins calls the legacy of \\"The Great Chain of Being,\\" which is implicit in the demand for \\"missing links.\\" In themiddle ages was the doctrine that there was a \\"great chain,\\" or a ladder, with inanimate objects at the bottom, lower animals next, followed by man, angels, and finally God. With this doctrine entrenched, it's difficult to understand how there can be any form of transition or \\"link\\" from something on one chain. But according to evolutionary biology, among living things there is no \\"chain\\" as such, since everything is interrelated- there is only growing complexity and/or diversity in response to environmental pressures.    The final thing that really impressed me in TGSOE was Dawkins' discussion of embryonic development. The DNA code, though containing instructions for how proteins are to develop based on the gene sequence, cannot be described as a blueprint. Blueprints have a one-to-one relationship. In other words you can have a blueprint and construct a building, and go to a building and reconstruct its blueprint; the same reciprocal relationship simply does not exist with organisms and gene sequences. Dawkins says that the best way to look at embryonic development is like origami, or the unfolding of the gene sequences through proteins and catalysts. This chapter was simply fascinating.    There is much else in the book that I could discuss in this review, such as Dawkins' discussion of the last paragraph of \\"Origin,\\" his discussion of \\"evolutionary theodicy,\\" carbon-dating, fossils, etc. Whether this book will turn the current anti-science cultural/political tide in a more favorable direction is is hard to say, though it is definitely well-written and will greatly help those wanting to learn about evolution a means of doing so.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw it tonight on Halloween.  I bought my ticket over a month ago, and I must say that it was well worth the wait.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film from beginning to end.  The audience in the theater was quiet throughout the whole movie, except to break out in spontaneous applause after one of Mike's performances.  It's hard to believe how good he still was.  Most of us didn't leave the theater until after the song This Is It was finished.  I've been a Michael Jackson fan for 3 quarters of my life.  I never got to meet the man in person, but this provided me with an insight into the type of person I've always suspected that he was; sweet, kind and generous, but at the same time a man who knew what he wanted and who was thoroughly in control when he was on stage.  MJ was really in his element here; he was confident and authoritative without being loud or abusive.  And the crew really appreciated this; you could tell how anxious they were to please him. He inspired everyone around him to want to do better.  This was just a rehearsal, so he supposedly wasn't giving his all here; but you could hardly tell that most of the time.  At age 50 Mike still had the voice, and the moves.  It was funny how the crew would watch him, mesmerized, and break out into applause after his routines.  The young people he chose as his dancers realized they were in the presence of royalty; you could see how star struck they were, and who could blame them?  It's a shame that the concerts never happened, but at least they did get to spend some time with the King.  I'm sure those memories will stay with them.  I loved how Michael encouraged the young female guitarist to take full advantage of her moment in the spotlight.  He was so kind that he didn't mind sharing the spotlight.  I really enjoyed it, but at the same time it made me sad, because this would have definitely put Mike back on top where he belonged, and now he'll never get that chance.  So unfair.   RIP, King of Music.  Your Fan forlife.

I had never heard of them until Revolver named the Red album album of the year. Very talented and excellent musicians. This whole record flows from one song to the next. I like how they have added a real southern feel throughout their songs without sounding like Skynyrd. These guys love to jam as most songs build up before John's vocals come in. There is a hidden track but I don't really listen to it too much. O think if you are tired of the current rock or metal scene you should definitely check out the Red album. Great record

0385504225|4.0|The first 30 pages or so were off-putting, it took a few pages to get connected, but after those initial pages, it became a very compelling read so don't give up on it.  As usual, Dan Brown delivers descriptive characters and places (I love that it is set in DC) and of course, lots of suspense.  He sometimes pushes the envelope on weirdness, but he makes up for it in page-turning intrigue.

With the upcoming production of The Magic Flute, I ordered this CD so I could listen and study the work before I performed it.  This CD was fantastic!  The soloists are great and the orchestral support is superb.  It inspired my long drives to and from rehearsals and performances.  I highly recommend this CD of The Magic Flute.
B002S0OBFK|3.0|This film is the definition of a \\"slow build\\" suspense film. Much like The Blair Witch Project, this is a movie filmed as if it were based on real events and shot with little production on a shoestring budget. There are only four people ever on screen; the characters are believable and the performances of the two leads, a couple who decide to film the strange \\"paranormal activities\\" going on in their house, really allow the audience to be sucked into their world. The only complaint is that this is still meant to be a horror film and the scares are few and far between. The ending, however, is absolutely fantastic.

0553801473|2.0|Really? Others here have summed up my sentiments in fabulous detail so I will just say, if you just have to read more of this story, you'll enjoy the book. If you are looking for resolution, completion or the storyline to pick up....well that isn't going to happen. I just don't need a list of 200 characters that mean nothing to me nor do I want to keep jumping around the countryside without an end game. Story lines are too broken, seem to be forgotten or lost and serously I am too!<br />I feel a little ripped off...like I got pulled into an amazing series, and then the author decided to just keep writing but forgot where he was going, or that there needs to be an ending soon. But by now all the characters worth following are dead,absent,or just doing strange unrelated things.<br />Wake me when it's over which I guess will be in another 5 years from now. Oh hummmm.

0307277453|5.0|I bought the book to read, like I do all the books I purchase. This I bought to read about one of the most important archeological finds of all time - the Tiktaalik. But I was simply amazed by what I found in the pages of this book.    Not only does Shubin explain the find, he presents the case of how we evolved from fish. Based on his knowledge of researching and teaching the human anatomy he explains how the most important parts of our body -- especially our hands -- directly descended from fish anatomy.     The stories he narrates are entertaining and revealing. His explanation is simple and easy to follow -- although I have to admit my continuing problem of remembering the medical terminology.    In the end (almost the end) Shubin reveals the most astonishing fact of all. That the scientists have stopped marshaling evidence which proves that we evolved from fish. It is as secure a 'fact' as the knowledge that the Earth revolves around the Sun. Simply brilliant.    So is the book.

0439023483|5.0|I stayed up all night reading this novel -it is that riveting! Collins gets right into the action from the beginning. Her writing style reminds me very much of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series because of the adventure and suspense. The first person narration was extremely smooth, lyrical -very much in keeping with the other novels by this author. Highly recommend this! Five stars.
0307394549|5.0|I have to say that Martha Stewart (& Co) do things well. The book is lovely to look at and well laid out; the photographs are excellent; the instructions are clear; and the variety is outstanding. I've had this book in my hands for about 5 hours and have looked at it, cover to cover. I'm unable to decide which to make first (it WILL have chocolate in it) but I'm sure I've already gained five pounds in anticipation.

B002UD56I6|4.0|I watched the film in the theatre and loved every minute of it. MJ was engaged in each and evey minute of the songs, rehearsals, set-ups and effects. His kind demeanor was also very interesting to watch. His presence was of a very special being. His stage performance was electric for the young and his team was full of talented young men and women who got further groomed and entertained the viewers with the heavenly experince. May God rest his soul in peace for touching the hearts and minds of so many in the world with his lyrics, music and action.

0393327345|3.0|Reviewing this book is difficult when you're an appreciator of the movie, as I am. To be bluntly honest, I prefer the movie (as a movie) than the novel (as a novel). Assuming most of you saw or heard of the movie before being interested in the book, there are indeed difference between the two, as always. Palanhiuk's style sort of jumps from scene to scene, in both directions of the timeline, and this may make some of you feel like the novel needs a little more fleshing out. In the same vein, Palanhiuk is no big fan of big paragraphs. The result, or at least the desired result (as can be known from the afterword this edition contains), is to trim everything down to the essential without losing the reader. Knowing the movie well, I can't quite say whether you may get lost or not, but judging by Palanhiuk's other novel Invisible Monsters, which shares many similarities with this one, I would venture that it probably does keep the reader firmly set in the story regardless of how the story unfolds.    The way I feel is that if you've seen the movie, you won't gain much from reading the book; in fact, you will probably think the movie is superior, in their respective medium. Some famous phrases change a bit from the book to the movie: \\"I am Jack's this and that\\" is \\"I am Joe's this and that\\" in the novel. And some of my favourite lines from the movies sound better in the movie than they do in the book. Hard to say if this is because I heard them first, but after comparison, I feel like the script of the movie is better written than the novel itself.    Maybe I sound harsh. Palanhiuk always has terrific ideas - most people agree with this - but sometimes the execution of those ideas don't please everyone. Haunted is a good example of that (although I was fine with it, but it's true some little things could have been better; and yes, I tend to write rather mediocre reviews, sorry).    In conclusion, it's not a bad read at all, but you're better of watching the movie, I believe. The movie has differences that, I think, improve on the novel. I'd compare this case with Philip K. Dick and Blade Runner. Tyler Durden is more charismatic in the movie than I found him in the novel. Again, I absolutely confess that I'm biased, having seen the movie first, so I can't have the same experience of the book, but yeah, I prefer Palanhiuk's other books, so far.    So... if you haven't read this book, I recommend watching the movie, and if you have already seen the movie, I recommend Invisible Monsters or Haunted instead, for Palanhiuk's work.

0312360258|2.0|While the story of Zoey Redbird is interesting, I found P.C. Cast's portrayal of Christians to be biased and overly critical. So much so that I have chosen not to spend money on any more books in this series. I'll just wait to read the library versions when they become available, because although I am a Christian, my mind is not so closed as to discount the potential for redemption in Cast's books.<br /><br />Although it is true that some fundamentalist evangelical Christians struggle with the lifestyle that they interprete from the bible, it is also true that many are trying their best to live up to a very high standard, in imitation of Christ. That they do not fully understand the world and society of Jesus' time is no different from our not understanding the world and society in which our own parents and grandparents grew up.<br /><br />Zoey hates her Christian stepfather and with the way he is portrayed, her hatred seems justified.  Hated of a particular people group is no less bigotry than hatred of African Americans or homosexuals or any other group that does not share one's point of view or lifestyle.<br /><br />It seems that the success of Cast's books and other young adult fiction themed on vampires has gained popularity in the wake of the amazing success of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series. Both have disenfranchised teen girls, a helpful group of vampires, an evil group of vampires, and the vampire hero-boyfriend, the conversion of a human into a vampire, and some Native Americans and Native American beliefs.<br /><br />As a Tulsa area resident, I found it amusing to recognize the locations mentioned in Marked. However, I also found it disingenous to depict Union High School [...] and Cascia Hall [...]  students as bullies and spoiled brats. There are bullies and spoiled brats and good kids in all high schools.

0670034711|1.0|What a load of narcissistic, self-indulgent, whiney tripe!  The only reason I finished this piece of crap was because I was incouraged to do so by a coworker who loved the book.  All I can is, what a whiner!  Your marriage ended? Poor you; it happens all the time.  Your relationship with your boyfriend ended? See previous sentence.  With absolutely no responsibilities whatsoever, you were able to just pack up and indulge your pathetically crippled emotions in a year of doing whatever the hell you want - stuff your boring face in Italy, sit on your ass in India and fart around in Bali.  Wow, aren't you a role model for women everywhere - NOT. Deal with the death of a spouse, being a single parent, watch a parent die a slow death from Alzheimer's and get back to us, will ya?<br /><br />Deleted this piece of garbage from the Kindle the second I finished reading it.  Simply terrible.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I've been listening to progressive rock and metal for just over a year now. The first prog band I liked was Dream Theater. I collected all their stuff, then realized there were bands out there that were just as good. I liked the sound of Mike Portnoy. After a bit of research, I found out he was in two other bands. One of them was Transatlantic.  So of course, I took a listen, as I like discovering new bands. I have to say, at first, I wasn't impressed. However, with time, I began to love SMPT:e and Bridge Across Forever. After listening to each of them about 20 times, I heard about The Whirlwind.   I counted down for 60 days. During this time, I continued listening to Transatlantic, and they slowly moved their way to the top of my prog band list.     Well, the day finally came. The Whirlwind arrived at my doorstep, and I dropped everything and listened to it. And man, do they deliver! The new album is a monster! The whole thing is divided into 12 tracks, but they flow together, creating one epic song. It moves through many different styles, much like their previous albums. You have no idea what is about to come next, which is the best part.  All four band members shine. There are a lot more guitar solos from Stolt than on the previous two albums. This simply proves how innovative he is. Trewavas grooves on the bass once again. Morse tears it up on the keyboards. And of course, the drumming by Portnoy is top notch and complex. All four get their chance to sing, and they are all good at it!    To make this review short: the album was worth the wait, it's amazing, and you should go buy it now!

B002GSXKN8|4.0|Way back in 1989, long before the current influx of superhero films, millions of people lined up to see Michael Keaton put on Batman's cape.....nah, let's be honest, people lined up to see Jack Nicholson's version of the Joker.  However, Keaton's wonderful performance shocked audiences and so began a string of successful films that got progressively campier over time.<br /><br />If you're like me, you thought \\"Batman\\" was excellent, liked \\"Batman Returns\\" even though alterations were made to the Penguin, enjoyed Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey in \\"Batman Forever\\" despite the campiness, and thanked the good Lord above that \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" managed to wipe away the stain of the fourth film in this collection, \\"Batman and Robin.\\"<br /><br />This \\"Four Film Favorites\\" collection gives fans of Batman and superheroes in general all four of Warner Brothers' late century versions of Batman on two bare bones discs. According to the box, each film comes with production notes.  What this boils down to is a stills gallery, brief actor bios, and a few lines about makeup, special effects, and Batman's wonderful toys.<br /><br />The actual films are presented in a widescreen format and appear to lack any major clean-ups.  The first film is a bit grainy at moments and the third film had faint traces of pixellation in close-ups, but the second and fourth film look visually excellent.<br /><br />I won't waste any time reviewing each film in depth.  If you want this collection, you probably already know why you are getting it.  I purchased it primarily for the first and third films in the franchise.  Being a completionist, though, I wanted to get the second and, yep, even the fourth film in this collection.  This two-disc set gives you all four films for a wonderful price.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Batman or comic book films who want all four of these movies without breaking the bank.  It will give you a taste of some of the best and some of the worst moments in comic film history!history!
B001EOOQF6|3.0|I compared this rhino version of Mob Rules to my 1996 U.K. Castle remaster version and the Castle one sounds a little better because it's not over compressed and limited, to the point of sounding almost distorted.

Sam the sexy bar owner and, well, there's more to Sam than meets the eye.  Vampire Bill ... well, he's just a downright sexy gentleman ... for a vampire.  And then there's Sookie ... who can't love naive, sweet, southern Sookie? It's a little racy at times, and intended for adults. But if you've got nothing else to do give it a shot.  I don't get HBO so I'm just waiting for season 2 to become available.
0307716988|5.0|Prior to this book, I had read four bios about MJ since he died and thought I knew everything, so I was pleasantly surprised to find so many new details in this book. If you are looking for \\"the dirt\\" on the Jackson family drama, this is not the book, as Michael doesn't stoop to gossip here. If you are looking for info on the last 21 years of his life, this is not the book. But if you are looking for insights into MJ's personality, feelings, behavior, motives and creativity, this is the best book out there. It reveals his childhood and entire life up to 1988, at the height of his fame. You will learn tidbits such as why he wore dark glasses and masks, his deepest feelings of loneliness and also his feelings of accomplishment and what made all the hard work worthwhile. You will also understand why he had so many body guards when you read the horror of being mobbed by fans. He makes it sound like something out of a Stephen King movie and you actually realize he could have been killed or maimed for life!<br /><br />In this intimate autobiography, Michael reveals the root of his shyness: his adolescent pimples from a diet of greasy processed foods. \\"The effect on me was so bad that it messed up my whole personality. I couldn't  look at people when I talked to them. I'd look down, or away.\\" This led him to become a vegetarian (though in his later years he ate a lot of chicken).<br /><br />Michael talks about his love of fans, especially children. One thing that stands out is when famous producer George Lucas told MJ that his baby's first words were \\"Michael Jackson!\\"<br /><br />A most eerie part of the book was when Michael discusses the song \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" noting that the title was the same as an Elvis Presley song. He notes (p. 172), \\"By the time our song had come out, people thought that if I kept living in seclusion the way I was, I might die the way he did. The parallels aren't there as far as I'm concerned and I was never much for scare tactics. Still, the way Elvis destroyed himself interests me, because I don't ever want to walk those grounds myself.\\"<br /><br />Then later on the last page of his writing, he notes, \\"Often in the past performers have been tragic figures. A lot of the truly great people have suffered or died because of pressure and drugs, especially liquor. It's so sad. You feel cheated as a fan that you didn't get to watch them evolve as they grew older.\\"<br /><br />The childhood is covered in great detail. Michael was famous for complaining about missing out on a childhood, but when you read of the antics and pranks pulled by him and his brothers, you don't feel much sympathy for him! There is also a simply adorable photo of MJ at the age of about 3 that I had never seen anywhere before. In fact, the book is riddled with dozens of photos of the Jacksons and MJ throughout the height of his solo career.<br /><br />When you read this book, you are also reminded of the olden days: the brothers were limited to 5 minute phone calls because they were anxiously awaiting word from a recording studio. Imagine, no call waiting, no separate cell phones. And no one who grew up with movies on VCRs or CDs can imagine the joy described by Michael with that once-a-year TV viewing of The Wizzard of Oz!<br /><br />One of my motives in reading these MJ books is to learn the secret of his success. The bottom line is talent plus hard work (which involves focus and sacrifice). As much as Michael regretted missing out on his childhood, his father taught him the kind of focus and discipline that is lacking in most of today's youth. Michael leaves us all this inspiring advice: \\"In the end, the most important thing is to be true to yourself and those you love and work hard. I mean, work like there's no tomorrow. Train. Strive. I mean, really train and cultivate your talent to the highest degree. Be the best at what you do. Get to know more about your field than anybody alive. Use the tools of your trade, if it's books or a floorto dance on or a body of water to swim in.\\" Thank you Michael, above all, for your example of what hard work, focus and passion can lead to!ou Michael, above all, for your example of what hard work, focus and passion can lead to!

0810983915|3.0|I've read all of the books in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series along with my son. Well, I have to say that I understand why kids like the humor in these books but as an adult I can honestly say that I am tiring of them. It could be that Greg who is in middle school continues to experience the same lessons in different ways but doesn't seem to learn much about the lessons of life.     In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, Greg is on summer vacation and is writing his experiences down in another diary but this summer, he prefers to stay indoors playing video games. His mother tries to find ways to coax him outside to the pool which he hates or on various family and outdoor adventures. There is usually a problem along the way and Greg gets into trouble. Greg often includes his friend Rowley in his antics and doesn't always treat him with the most respect and Rowleys parents don't like that. The comics accompany each story add a nice touch and are the highlight of the series for most kids. I did enjoy Greg's excursion to the beauty salon where his mother drops him off for a haircut and he gets involved in the ladies gossip, gets to read gossip magazines and wants to go back again.     As a parent, I would like to see Greg learn more from his actions and show more maturity and emotional growth as he gets older. As a kid, they love that he gets away with things and gets himself into hysterically funny situations that he can't get himself out of.     My son's thoughts: \\"I like that these books are funny and Greg has a good personality....he is kind of cool because he does funny stuff. I can't wait until the next book comes out!\\" He would rate the book at 5 stars for sure!!

It was completely painful to try and slog through the contrived dialogue and nonsensical plot.

At first I thought that it was limited to just the first disk but no I played an episode that was on disk #4 and encountered the same problem.  I also bought a copy of this from borders and encountered the same problem so now I have to return both of them!

I am planning on waiting until the second release if there is one so that this problem can be addressed.

0061703257|5.0|My first Lehane novel & certainly not my last. Set in the early 1950's, Mr. Lehane has provided us with what appears at first to be a haunted island mystery. Instead he pulls the haunted past from a very real character and develops his story around that. The island actually being an old psychiatric hospital. The characters are very real & believable. The story is not thin at all & will keep you turning pages. The ending is not a pat finish. The ending will keep you thinking, as did the story leading up to it. Is the main character real or is he a patient at the hospital with the only \\"Reality\\" being in his own head? There is no fluff or pages of endless dialogue. You can sink your teeth into this literary piece until you come out the other end
0812550757|2.0|I'd heard from friends and strangers alike had that this sequel to \\"Ender's Game\\" was better than the original. I'd like to know what they based this evaluation on. I mean, Ender's Game was action-packed, interesting, integrated with fascinating, forward-thinking technology, and driven by the motivation of complex characters. With \\"Speaker for the Dead,\\" I felt as if the main rule in storytelling had been broken, like Card was telling me and not showing me. He droned on and on and provided little action, little suspense. I'm surprised I even finished the book. The only reason I did finish was I waiting to find out what all the excitement was about. In my opinion, there wasn't any excitement.    I think a lot of readers must not want their heart rates to get too high; they want to be talked to for 382 pages. They want sensitive, introspective characters who think and talk alot but accomplish very little. Maybe that's why they prefer Speaker over Ender's Game. For me, I want action, conflict, action, death, danger, destruction, cool technology, and action again, with a sprinkling of real human emotion. Not some lame vision of a planet full of pacifistic pigs and humans warring with an enemy we never see, an enemy that never really puts any pressure on our protagonists. And the author's foreword and the pronunciation key shows that both Card and fans of the book take this snoozer of a story way too seriously. Sorry to be a dissenter here, but the stakes have got to be higher, the enemy more menacing ... or else I might as well turn to literature or romance, two genres from which the Hugo and Nebula Award judges must have been appointed.
B00000JPH6|2.0|I was there in theater when this movie came out. I ordered it to see why it had not caught on the old movie channels, now I know. I remembered it as more interesting. Service on getting the movie was excellent.
B0001HLVSC|4.0|I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent. This is a war film which is certainly worth watching.
B00005QGAV|5.0|To me, Dangerous is MJ's most artistic endeavor.  There are several songs on here that are stand-alone artistic achievements and speak to his creative mind.  The songs I am thinking of are Will You Be There, Keep the Faith, Who is It, Give in to Me and Dangerous. All of these songs have multiple layers in the music, interesting devices such as spoken word, wide ranging vocals and featured instruments such as the electric guitar on Give in to Me. They all have meaningful and complex lyrics.     There weren't a ton of #1 hits on this album, unlike Bad, but the album itself sold extremely well world-wide.  The reason is that most of the songs are not \\"mainstream\\" but they all have held up over the years.  I wouldn't say any of them sound outdated. There were some songs that took me a while to get into - mainly the hard-driving beats in the first few songs.  My husband kept saying Dangerous was his favorite MJ album and then I finally took the time to really listen, and now I see why.  I now enjoy all of the songs.  They are intense.  My favorite right now is Keep the Faith, which begins with a beautifully sung intro and then keeps climbing to a crescendo at the end. This album is worth owning in its entirety.
B000M341RI|3.0|It skips but the description did not say it was in excellent condition. I believe it was probably appropriately described and I probably had an experience of \\"you get what you pay for\\". But I adore this movie. Perhaps I'll try again.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|While this isn't the worst book I have ever read, it ranks right down there. The errors in the beginning of the book spoiled the beginning, and complete implausibility of the rest of it made the book a struggle to read through. Never read Dan Brown before, and am not likely to ever again. I could write better than this on my worst day. If you must try to read it, get a library copy or borrow a friend's. It's certainly not worth paying money for.

B002SV36XM|1.0|The \\"Tempest\\" shares the distinction -- along with \\"Love's Labor's Lost\\" -- of featuring a plot mostly contrived by Shakespeare himself.  And it shows.  Thank God for Amazon reviews, since it would be suicidal for somebody in the academy to point out all the obvious flaws of this crud.  So allow me:<br /><br />1.  We're constantly being reminded about Ariel's upcoming freedom:  Was this meant to be the real tension of the play?  Because even at final curtain, we never actually see him freed.  This is dramatically unsatisfying.<br />2.  Prospero breaks his staff and drowns his books before sailing back to Milan.  So what's to prevent him from being stabbed, thrown overboard, or dispensed with once everybody reaches the shore?  He's made tons of enemies - and now he hasn't his magic to protect him.  Admit it:  this was in the back of your mind as the play ended, marring its grace.<br />3.  Doesn't anybody in this play ever have a look around before jumping to three pages of high-blown philosophical conclusions? (E.g., \\"This is some monster of the isle...\\")<br />4.  On this island, what has Miranda been using for tampons and stuff?<br />5.  You get leery when thinking what a cruddy job Prospero does of vetting his daughter's future husband.  I suppose the idea of having him make Ferdinand's pursuit of Miranda fraught with difficultly so's he'd appreciate her more was serviceable enough, but all it really amounts to is making him schlep some logs around for an afternoon.<br />6.  It would appear that Prospero was usurped with good reason.  He apparently had his nose in books all the time, whereas his brother evidently has the wherewithal to manage affairs of state with a more hardheaded realpolitik.  (He's just concluded, for example, a valuable alliance-by-marriage with Tunis.)  If Prospero really had the makings of a Prince, he would have demonstrated same by offing Alonso and company right there and then, since permitting them to live is bound to lead Milan into civil war later, when they regroup.<br />7.  That sappy, stilted, and pretentious \\"masque\\" scene doesn't belong there.  Or at least not at such length.  The young lovers aren't even married yet!  That's another thing:<br />8.  The subplot between Ferdinand and Miranda is resolved far too early in the play, making the ending intolerably long.<br />9.  The introductory shipwreck scene is totally unnecessary!  What does it add?  It's like Shakespeare was trying to show off his command of nautical terminology.<br />10.  Most of the poetry is forgettable.  Some of it blows outright.  E.g.:  \\"You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary, / Come hither from the furrow and be merry. / Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on, / And these fresh nymphs encounter everyone / In country footing.\\"  Uh, you're joking, right?<br />11.  What's up with Prospero having Ariel maliciously taunt the bereaved Ferdinand about his drowned father?  What did Ferdinand do to deserve that?<br />12.  Seems like there more characters than are really needed.  If this has been bandied about as a script these days, any Hollywood studio would have immediately made the obvious decision:  combine Antonio, Sebastian, Adrian, and Fransisco into fewer, or delete them.  And that studio would have been right.<br />13.  Uh . . . has anybody noticed that the entire five-minute scene between Prospero and Miranda just after the shipwreck scene is nothing more than bald, unimaginative exposition?  Master playright, eh?  Heck, same thing goes for the scene just after that with Ariel, now that I think about it.<br /><br />Oh, you're being too literal, too realistic, you might complain.  You've been ruined by the 19th century.  Okay, then let's take the play on its grander meanings.  Here's what it teaches us:<br /><br />12.  Usurpation is bad.  Everybody should know their place in society and not rock the boat by getting uppity.  Caliban was wrong to have pursued his freedom:  he should have known his place as a slave.<br/>13.  It's the height of wisdom to marry somebody you just met yesterday without investing a greater effort in trying to get to know them.<br />14.  Women must not have their \\"virgin knots\\" broken, or they are impure and will not make acceptable wives.<br />15.  Getting drunk helps you make stupid decisions.<br />16.  Big psychological insight:  Instead of endlessly justifying themselves, people have sudden epiphanies where they immediately and clearly perceive their guilt, causing them to change their worldview and lives on the spot (e.g., \\"Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded.\\")<br />17.  As always in Shakespeare, prophecies always come true, so it's pointless to try to change one's destiny.  Just once I'd like to see some withered old hag utter some omen of doom, then at the end of the play it turns out to be nothing.  That, at least, would constitute some insight into the human condition:  people can't tell the future!<br /><br />So literally the play is a flop.  And as for the play's deeper meanings - can somebody tell me why such sentiments are thought to be worth our time these days?<br /><br />I think people find this play gratifying because the setup (i.e., a remote, green, magical island; a shipwreck; a benign magician; a beautiful and innocent daughter; a misshapen fish-like beast) is such an alluring daydream:  people like to picture themselves in such a setting.  Hard for me to play along, though:  apparently that island won't shut up long enough for you to take a nap.without investing a greater effort in trying to get to know them.  14.

0385504225|5.0|An overriding theme in Dan Brown's writing is: secrets are bad.  Whether it's the Masons, Opus Dei, or the Catholic Church in general, there don't seem to be any redeeming qualities in protecting secrets.  In fact, none of the secrets once revealed and understood are as frightening or shocking as those addicted to secrecy, power, and control woud have us believe.  His personal statement might be this simple, \\"Isn't it time we're all honest with each other?\\"  If we were, his hope for a better world, as well as ours, would have a decent chance of being realized.  Many of the conclusions in his novels seem very redemptive. While an ill-adapted few are searching to find faults in his facts, most readers are able to see a wider and more authentic interpretation of reality in his fiction.

0882709194|1.0|\\"Abridged\\" is used very loosely here. A more accurate description would be to say that it has been selectively edited to remove information that the author does not want readers to see since it easily refutes many of his claims.    It is missing critical chapters which present some of the best evidence that Darwin presented to support evolution.    Why would these chapters be deliberately and selectively removed if, as the author claims, this book is intended to present a complete picture so readers could decide on their own if evolution is an acceptable explanation?    The author falsely accuses scientists of dishonesty in his introduction but, in turn, withholds information that contradicts his premise in creating this corrupted version of Darwin's original work.    If you truly want to learn what Darwin presented to support evolution, please select another, complete edition of Origin of Species.

During the movie, I could see and hear people moving along with the music. The concerts would have been spectacular, and it is a shame we didn't get to experience Michael returning to the stage.

B00275EGX8|5.0|Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, one of a scant few women directors in Hollywood, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is the best film I've seen so far about the Iraq conflict. Categorized as a \\"war thriller\\", it centers on an elite US Army EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit and the dangers they encounter as they complete the final weeks of their year-long tour of duty. The film starts with a \\"cold open\\" (no credits or title card), throwing you right into middle of an IED defusal. We see three men engaging in playful banter while guiding a bomb disposal robot before a snag forces Thompson, the bomb tech (Guy Pearce), to attempt a manually defusal. The situation quickly escalates when Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) spots an insurgent holding a cellphone. Ordered by Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) to \\"burn him\\", Owen is paralyzed by fear and unable to pull the trigger, resulting in a detonation that kills Thompson.<br /><br />Top-flight bomb disposal expert Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is sent in as a replacement. Right away on their first mission, the team finds out that he is a reckless and impulsive loose cannon whose blatant disregard for operating procedures puts everyone's lives in danger. Over the course of the film, we see personality clashes develop, sometimes becoming violent, as J.T. and Owen accuse Will of endangering their lives for a high. Over time, however, J.T. comes to respect Will and the work he does. We see Will's intense dedication to his job and self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming bodily peril.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes makes a brief appearance as the leader of a small group of British PMC's, as does a mustachioed David Morse, who is here for a short couple of minute as a loud and boisterous Colonel, mostly for comic effect.<br /><br />The Hurt locker is a gritty, muscular, and visceral viewing experience. Filmed in a jittery cinema veritee style, we get a sense of immediacy and closeness that few other films employing this technique have been able to match. Where it was nauseating in [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]] or devoid of warmth in [[ASIN:B002QEHPR4 Public Enemies]], it is tastefully and masterfully done here. I was never distracted or taken out of a scene to remark on the camerawork. The style really works here and enhanced the immersion I felt, heightening the tension level and perception of realism. I felt my heart racing in many of the high-tension scenes not knowing what would happen next, not an easy task given how jaded I've become as a result of Hollywood movie-making. Without a doubt, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is one of the most thrilling and suspenseful military dramas I've seen in a long time. I must also remark on the sound design and music. All of it came together and felt very natural, further adding to the production value and enjoyability of this film. Last, I must warn of some extreme gore, particularly one scene towards the end.<br /><br />Highly enjoyable and worth watching, especially if you enjoyed urban conflict films like [[ASIN:B000G0O5N2 Black Hawk Down]]. A must-own if you are a war film fan.<br /><br />About the Blu-ray disc itself:<br />The Hurt Locker is a 50GB Region A disc sporting an excellent transfer, but the extras are thin, with only a director's commentary, a 12 minute making-of documentary, and a 23 minute narrated slideshow.

These people preferred to connect with others in a stronger way. I understand this reaction, but I can tell you from experience it's a mistake. Two reasons for this: 1. The strength of weak ties; Google it. The people who get really close to you cannot effectively expand your power base, personally or professionally. They are too much like you, and there are too few of them. It is the people on the margins of your life who can open up new vistas of possibility, and this is especially crucial in business. You will not build a business on people you see every week, the godparents of your children. If a problem at work has you stumped, email people in other industries, other cities, other countries. They will open your mind to new solutions, much better than your golf buddy will.<br /><br />2. Your weak ties are also the most effective at introducing you to new strong ties. If you are single and want to meet a new love interest, put feelers out with people you don't see often.<br /><br />Several negative reviewers dinged the author for going to an ivy league school. Okay, let's say he had it made anyway, and networking didn't matter. It matters for ME, and it will matter for YOU. I grew up in the sticks. I don't have a standard college degree. I never undertook formal study of the profession that pays me very well.  I owe my entire career to effective networking, and I've succeeded beyond all expectations.

1401323820|4.0|I had so much fun reading this! I couldn't believe it when after one of my favorite shows, Castle, I heard that you could really buy the fictional book featured in the television series. I also loved that they set Castle's character up like he was an authentic and established real-life author even down to the acknowledgments and review lines. And my husband laughed when I told him the Castle-type character in Heat Wave was named Rook, the name of the castle shaped piece in chess.    It's not an overly complicated novel but the mystery of a real estate tycoon who plunges to his grisly death and all the possible motives and suspects for who could have done it were very good. I still wasn't sure who the culprit was until Heat finally confronted them, also revealing it to Rook. There's a real nauseating bad guy as well that gets his just desserts in the end.    As on the show between Beckett and Castle, Heat and Rook have a clever competitiveness and a non-stop sexual tension between them that leaves readers entranced. I hope they consider putting out other books in this series as the show continues! My only complaint is that the book was nowhere near as thick as the novel shown on Castle's tv show.

Some friends who had seen him live were ecstatic about him, so we piled into the car and off we drove on three road trips, time well spent.<br /><br />At American University in DC, Spirit was the warm up band followed by Frampton. We were center stage, something like row ten.<br /><br />Each concert, Frampton blew me away, I had already seen everyone worth seeing with good seats. Frampton Comes Alive is a gross understatement, \\"Frampton Dwarfs all other Live Performances\\" would be more accurate but I can see where the PR guys might have trouble marketing it.<br /><br />Barring the invention of a time machine, Comes Alive is as close as you can get; unfortunately, the magic Frampton had on stage can never be put into a package. Frampton's vocals, voice box and his guitar were three working as one.<br /><br />To find a concert date, check out his web site; he still tours. I'm sure he can still make a guitar sing.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />The other top two live band, which I had very very low expectations for, was Jefferson Starship with Grace Slick and Marty Balin at the Capitol Center in Maryland.<br /><br />My date wanted to go, so I sucked it up and contemplated how I would look interested for three hours at a concert I didn't want to hear. The date was a bomb, the concert blew me away from the opening curtain to the last note.<br /><br />The stage magic between Slick and Balin, unfortunately, can not be put into a bottle either. Two as one.

0061537969|5.0|A friend shared this book with me, and I absolutely loved it.  Having raised 3 golden retrievers (or did they raise me?), I immediately was drawn to this endearing book. Then I had to order a few copies to give as gifts to others who I knew would delight in this novel.  Actually, ANYONE who loves dogs would probably enjoy reading The Art of Racing in the Rain. The title alone makes one curious about what lies on the pages within. The picture on the cover was all it took for me to want to read it.  This book will illicit both laughter and tears. Dogs become part of our families, entertain us, frustrate us at times, but most of all get wedged deeply in our hearts. After 33 years of sharing our lives with 3 different golden retrievers, my family and I have been blessed with 3 loving and loyal best friends. This book reminded me of how much we can learn from these amazing canines. Living in the now, unconditional love, faithfullness, the simple joys of life,and companionship are just a few things that Shawn, Dylan, and now Cooper have clarified for me.  If you really pay attention, dogs communicate without words, sometimes better than humans do ....WITH words.  After writing this review, I want to reread The Art of Racing in the Rain. Why not?  The more joy in life, the better!  Thank you Garth Stein for this fun and enlightening book.
B001SR9NNO|3.0|I may not quite be well versed enough in classic Greek dialogs to fully \\"get\\" this, although it is considered a classic by millions of readers. I understand and appreciate that the author was trying to find a way to synthesize his own thoughts about Eastern philosophy with his classical Western training, but I found it sort of boring and confusing. I believe it was revolutionary at the time, but now if I wanted to find out more about Asian philosophy, I'd go right to the source (and have, see Masao Abe's Zen and Western Thought.)<br /><br />What I did find interesting in the story was the narrator's portrayal of how he remembers what he was like before he had a nervous breakdown and received shock treatments, as opposed to how he is now. He attempts to reconcile his emerging original personality with his new one in a way that parallels his integration of Eastern and Western thought.<br /><br />I wish there had been more focus on how the re-emergence of the original personality was going to affect his family relationships. Would he go back to his obsession with philosophical questions to the exclusion of his family, or would he now be able to find a better balance?<br /><br />A final thought is a quote I heard recently to the effect that the more a man considers his work to be revolutionary and important to the world, the more likely he is to have a nervous breakdown, which seems to be what happened here.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|All of it is awesome, but I have heard other CD's that claim to be the sountrack, that actually have different tracks than this one. So I am wondering which is the true official version. Also, this does not seem to be long enough to be an entire soundtrack. But the music is ethnic, haunting and beautiful. It stirs the blood.
141041986X|4.0|Some reviewers are predicting that \\"The Hunger Games,\\" by Suzanne Collins, will the next Harry Potter or Twilight Saga. It's not as original or well-written as the Harry Potter novels, but the set up for the book will probably appeal to young sci-fi fans just as much as magic and vampires do, and its anti-authoritarian theme will resonate with many readers.<br /><br />The book's protagonist is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a slum resident in a dystopian future America, now called \\"Panem.\\" She's an isolated loner, with a dead father, an emotionally absent mother, a little sister she loves more than anything, and a platonic male friend who helps her hunt for food on a daily basis. In this future, the haves and have-nots are sharply divided among the rich, pampered government people who live in the Capitol, and everyone else who has to scrounge for food and other scarce resources (a situation with which I'm sure many of today's anti-government factions can relate).<br /><br />In a plot device similar to the one in \\"The Running Man,\\" every year the Capitol forces children from the slums to compete in televised death matches until the last person standing wins and is awarded money and food for life. Unlike many similar stories, however, \\"The Hunger Games\\" uses this setting to remove the main character from her regular daily life in order for her to process her feelings of alienation and resentment among strangers instead in her own family. Her new environment also helps Katniss re-examine her relationship with her mother, and develop empathy with people from different backgrounds.<br /><br />Like all reality game show contestants, Katniss has her own support team that wants to make her look good. At first she disdains them completely, but becomes more open to them when she realizes her ability to survive the games depends in part on them. As the story continues, she is forced to ally with other contestants, and starts to empathize with them in spite of herself. Her participation in the games breaks Katniss down emotionally and physically,  and lets her repressed anger, vulnerability and longing to rise to the surface.<br /><br />Katnisss attitude about the oppressive nature of her government is the most striking departures from so much of the young adult lit that is popular now.  In books with similar settings, like the Stephen King/Richard Bachman novel I loved as a teenage, \\"The Long Walk,\\" the teenage participants blame unfair and unrelating adults for their predicaments.  In \\"The Hunger Games,\\" Katniss bitterly places the blame on the machinations of government and society as a whole, which seems like a more insightful (if oversimplified) approach.<br /><br />The growth and changes that Katniss undergoes during the games puts this novel in a better class than many similar speculative fiction novels, and her insights about her participation in her own oppression makes it a breath of fresh air compared with similar stories.  The action makes it a fun and easy read as well.eaks Katniss down emotionally and physically,  and lets her repressed anger, vulnerability and longing to rise to the surface.

B001NXDIMK|4.0|I am not a TV addict. I only watch news (CNN, BBC, DWTV) and football (the real one, not the USaberration). But there are always exceptions... Like now, I am stuck at home with a cold, have to cancel a trip to avoid swine flu quarantine.<br />What does one do with mountains of windfall time, when one is not fit for serious pursuits? Either one reads pulp fiction, or Hegel (just joking), or one watches TV show DVDs.<br />This is how I ended up investing hours, that I could have used more productively, with Damages, Season 2. I never watched Season 1, which is supposed to be better, more coherent, more compact. (Watching DVDs when sick has social advantages over reading; one can more easily share the activity.)<br /><br />My conclusion: if you have to waste your time, this series is not the worst of all options!<br />What do you get? You get a high society crime soap, focused on a female lawyer, Glenn Close, with unclear morality. You get a beautiful young colleague and co-worker of hers, a Queen Rania look alike, who bears grudges and conspires against her boss. You get the worlds of class action suits, of big capital bosses and their hobbies, of financial manipulations, of environmental crime, of corruption and betrayal... And it is highly complex and complicated and you are forgiven if you sometimes lose track of who did what when and where.<br /><br />It is good on suspense. It is intriguing on the level of motivation. Some people are easy to understand, they want money and power. Our heroines here, and also some of the men, eg the William Hurt character, are harder to read.<br />And hardest is the moral evaluation: it is doubly vexing. Not only don't we know the facts, so we can't justly judge, but we are also shown things in differing and conflicting lights, which is of course designed to confuse us. What has actually happened and why? Who are the good guys and who the bad ones? Which moral code counts more in case of a clash?<br /><br />First class entertainment with brilliant actors. Deduction of one star due to the excessive flipping about with time lines.e star due to the excessive flipping about with time lines.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|The photo sparked my curiosity! The description further seduced my soul...<br /><br />\\"If on a winter's night\\" is truly a must have collection of folk and traditional English songs, some of which span from the 14Th century! This collection of song has been personally gathered by Sting himself, most taken from the British Isles. This winter collection is quite intimate, authentic and extremely well done! You will fade into another place and time as you realize an almost dream state, as you relax and absorb each tranquil and at times festive musical masterpiece. This collection is as genuine as the centuries of English and Irish & Scottish tradition/history in which it conjures! Beautifully done Sting!

B002HNA95E|5.0|I really think this is the ultimate Madonna collection, absolutely everyone should have.  As one of the most influential music legends, even if you're not a fan, you'll like this compilation.    The first CD is more 90's - 00's oriented club music, a lot dance tracks, with a hip hop ending with Revolver.  This CD could be perfectly used as a warm up while you're driving to a club.    The second CD is more ballad - 80's oriented, a lot of dub, drums and guitars.  I like it because it shows you how far M has come.  A very good CD to be played if you want to remember the very good old Madonna hits.  Of course, this #2 CD also has some not-that-old tracks, like Take a Bow, and Celebration.    In other wors, a must have for everyone !!!
B000001F68|5.0|I had a yearning to revisit one of my favorite albums from my younger days. The tracks from this album never make it to the radio even on classic rock stations.  I must say that the album in its entirety was not as great as I remembered, but it was pretty darn good and certainly beats the heck out of most of the product being produced today. The concept of a theme album still exists but the execution just doesnt seem to be there. I find myself gravitating to the older items in my collection. You can file this review under new music troglodyte.
0739319175|1.0|I've given up trying to put up with this awful audio book.  The narrator gives one of the worst performances I have ever listened to.  I so very much wanted to enjoy this book on CD, but Dan Brown, as an author, fails miserably, in my humble opinion.  For example, imagine sentences along the lines of, \\"...and suddenly a dark stranger appeared...\\" - if I had handed that in to my grade 6 English Teacher, I'm sure I would have recieved a \\"C-\\" grade.  \\"Lost Symbol\\" is one big disappointment.  Try listening to a poor (male) narrator trying feebly to imitate a (female) throat cancer survivor's raspy voice - it's truly painful.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a big miss.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|As soon as i put this album on, I knew it was AIC. It is a good album, but without the presense of a strong lead singer it doesn't have what it takes to be a great album. On only one track, (last of my kind)? do they allow their new bandmate to add his input. The rest of it is him harmonizing with Cantrell's vocals. Sounds like old Alice, but you definely notice something missing...Old albums had the layered vocals for the body of the songs but also featured Layne's voice in the chorus or to transition,there was more of a dynamic. whatever that means...you get the point. Maybe they will get it right next time

B0006SSOHC|3.0|Initially I will admit that I had no desire whatsoever to watch 'Saw'. My expectations were that it was going to be nothing more than just another one of those splatter films whose sole aim was to nauseate and repulse the audience.<br /><br />Miracle of miracles, I happened to be wrong. While the gore element is there, for the most part it is an anticipated horror more than an actually realized one (at least by today's standards). For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought-provoking script which dialogues with the audience on such concerns as the nature of life, death and what a person would be willing to do to retain ones life.<br /><br />For me what really makes the film work is the protagonist nicknamed Jigsaw. While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless. Well worth a watch, or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|As a fan of the ABC show Castle, I thought the book was tongue and cheek. It was entertaining and I have to say, I would read another one. The book was not a literary work of art, but still a fun read!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|amazing, awesome, spectacular, wonderful and any other word to describe this GIFT TO US!!!! Of course the real concert would have been better. but this was amazing too. It left me wanting more, I didnt want to get up and leave the theatre. This is my only way to ever see him perform being that i was a kid when he did his last concerts, but i'll take this. man i cant wait for the DVD, so i can watch him all the time. I would pre order but i want my copy the day its availiable. everyone should go watch this and keep MJ alive in our hearts. now im addicted and have to go see it many more times before its out of theaters =]

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB-400 is a great product and delivers plenty of positives.  It is easy to use, easy to attach to the camera, and does everything that a lot of more expensive units do.

B0009MAO46|5.0|I  purchased The Toy Story DVD for my 3 year old greatgranddaughter. She loves this movie and wants to watch it every day. I'll be so glad when Toy Story 3 comes out next summer.

B001HYX3IY|4.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" puts forth a hypothesis for why certain societies and cultures have flourished over human history.  Jared Diamond's hypothesis is diligently supported by extensive research and background material.<br /><br />Following Diamond's logic and thought processes, this book offers tremendous explanatory power in terms of why the societies and cultures of the world are as they are today.  There are few publications that set forth such an ambitious goal (explain why some societies and cultures flourish), achieve said goal, and do so in an accessible and relatively concise manner.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a wonderful book.  The writing, however, is unbalanced.  I found the focus on items such as plant biology and New Guinea to be tedious and too heavily weighted, especially given the wide canvas of man's evolution across the world.<br /><br />The book's unbalanced nature risks drawing readers away from the powerful central messages and the support of Diamond's hypothesis.  Assuming readers can keep this book's grand and sweeping backdrop in mind, Diamond offers deep insights for his audience.<br /><br />I recommend this book to readers with a deep interest in the development of our world.  The caveat for all readers is to avoid being pulled into the minutiae of topics such as plant biology and New Guinean politics.  Keeping the grand context in mind makes it a lot easier to understand why this great book won the Pulitzer Prize.
0307716988|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Join MJ as he was climbing the stairs to international stardom. You see what it was for him, from his point of view. Share his joy, his hardships, his frustration. Come and see it through his eyes. Read all this information from his lips, and none other. You've got to feel MJ, simply feel him. It's breathtakingly interesting and moving. Worth every penny!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|You mindless soldier better listen up. This  general SOB takes no talk about being cowards. You better watch this video or he give you a right hook. It George Scott and he plays Patton. He hatesd Germans and  Russian and espocally his own generals. He the poster boys why you never let someone like him playing with toy tanks. This is the best WWII movie and if you a WWII fan like me. This is your only understanding why we won WWII, buy this video it never gets old.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I think this LP, yes I have the vinyl version... is better than a lot of Pink Floyd Albums and his best solo project to date. I highly recommend this album.  To really get the feel of this album I suggest watching or purchasing DVD Live At Royal Albert Hall.  It enhanced my appreciation and feel for this release by David Gilmour. I like his guitar style on this album and watching live (even though on DVD and not in person) makes you appreciate musicians like David Gilmour who are few and far between these days. True Guitar heros are truely rare and too bad we will not see a David Gilmour LIVE performance in the US anymore and/or it is highly unlikely. Great Album David Gilmour.
B000MTFFZY|5.0|I recently bought Delain's newer release, April Rain, and loved it. Lucidity wasn't available as an MP3 download, so I had to purchase a CD, but it was well worth the extra cost and the wait to get it. I just wish they had more CDs to buy!
0061245097|5.0|I have never been motivated enough to write a review on any book until I read this series.  After finishing the Sookie Stackhouse series I was searching for something that would keep me occupied until the next book in the series came out.  On the advise of book forum I found this series.  After reading the first few pages of the first chapter online I was already hooked.  The writing style and dialogue Frost uses is neither repetitive or pulpy, as I've noticed other writers from this genre use.  Her use of description is also quite impressive.  After reading the first book I found myself desperate to find out what happens next, and I quickly tracked down the remaining 3 books.  The whole series is fast passed, romantic, action filled, and has a refreshing new take on vampires.  The only bad thing I can say is that the author decided to write a few spin-offs from this series instead of writing the 5th book.  Keep'em coming please.
B001IMFHVG|4.0|Rubinstein's performance, of course, is 5+ stars!  And, considering the state of recording and filming in Russia in 1964, this may also deserve 5 stars.  However, just because it is not in color, and there is some \\"fuzziness\\" to the recording which may be distracting to some, I give it only 4 stars.    However, for the true Rubinstein fan, this is a fascinating performance, and this DVD should certainly be in his/her Rubinstein library
B000296P2G|5.0|This is one of my old time favorite movies. There are remakes, but do not compare. This is sopose to be be old fashion and dark. Lets not forget there was no electricity in those days. To make it believeable it had to be dark.  Great actors.
0786868724|5.0|This book took my beliefs in faith to a new level. I am not entirely religious, however, I am a spiritual person.

B002KLAL4W|5.0|love this one, Less screaming from Eddie, more soul coming out of him.  I just love his voice.  Also like the fact that there are lyrics for all the songs.  Unlike the first couple albums (some songs I just couldn't understand what he was singing)
B001V7UXG2|4.0|One has to be a Anglophile to truly enjoy this, mostly because of the sound track.  Half the humor could be lost, and that is a shame, if one is not familiar with the Brits mannerisms and phrasings.  That being said, even half of the humor far exceeds that of anything produced for American television audiences in the past 25 years.  Add the exquisite scenery and antique furnishings, and you have several hours of enjoyment. (And need I mention, with no inane commercials to suffer through!!)
0439023483|5.0|I feel like \\"whirlwind\\" and \\"rollercoaster ride\\" are two very overused phrases when it comes to reviews.  It's thus a good thing that I don't want to use them here, because they are far from describing the sheer awesomeness of this book.  It was more like Charlie's ride in the elevator at the end of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\\"  It starts going up, and it's interesting and cool and getting more and more exciting.  And just when you think it can't be more awesome than that, the elevator explodes out of the ceiling into an infinite space and new realms of unknown coolness and awesomeness.<br />In other words, this book was GOOD.  VERY GOOD.  The futuristic dystopian world that Suzanne Collins has created so believable and horrifying that at times I forgot she was talking about a place that doesn't actually exist.  And thank god.  It is frightening and violent and gripping and disgusting and yet you just can't keep turning the pages.  Because even though you know that what comes next will probably make you cringe, you have to know.  This book sucks you in and doesn't spit you out until well after it's over, after you've spent several days or even weeks thinking about what you've just read.<br />It also manages to contain within all that gore and non-stop action a teenage love story that breaks all norms and doesn't fit in with the typical YA romance.  It is something entirely new and entirely different that fits perfectly with the book and the world and the plotline that Suzanne Collins has created.<br />I know everyone has already read this or at least read a thousand reviews of this, so I won't bore you by saying the same things all over again.<br />Just remember this - this book surpasses genre.  It is YA, yes.  It is dystopian fiction, yes.  But oh, it is also SO much more than that.  Be prepared for the game of a lifetime.<br />Think Battle Royale but less complex and, dare I say it, far more gripping and amazing.
B002LFIZDG|4.0|I argue that the Kings of Convenience never got their due in the States.  The Kings have a unique sound--minimalistic in many ways but for some reason feels complete in song.  The intricate harmonies, limited orchestration, and simple yet elegant music that the Kings have would get drowned out in the pre-teen pop, hard rock, and R&B that fill radio today.  That, and their music and lyrics tend to feel like a light depressant and/or therapy for guys thinking about their former girlfriends.  Not great for US radio play.  But don't let that keep their good music from getting made.        Their latest album, \\"Declaration Of Dependence\\" is their first in five years.  Over that time, lead singer (sort-of) Erlend Øye released a number of albums, including two with the great Berlin-based \\"minimalist rock\\" group Whitest Boy Alive.  Eirik Glambek Bøe was less active musically.  However, time doesn't have much of an effect on their music, as fans from their earlier albums \\"Quiet Is The New Loud\\" and \\"Riot On An Empty Street\\" will find the transition to \\"DoD\\" easy.  I feel like DoD is more similar to some of the softer and tranquil songs of both albums.  There isn't as much of a fast-paced effort that \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" or \\"Misread\\" have--this is more like \\"Parallel Lines\\" or \\"The Build Up\\". That being said, some of the songs they have promoted on their website (\\"Mrs. Cold\\" and \\"Boat Behind\\") are tremendously catchy and fill that need for a faster tempo, soft-rock (I hate to call it that) feel.      I find the songs on DoD beautiful in the same vein as their past albums but I wonder how often I will listen to them.  Are they so likeable that I'll go through dozens of listens like in their past albums?  I'm not sure yet, but I'd say that some of their songs are going to get that treatment more than others.  The last songs on the album drag with their similarity and maybe I'll end up focusing on the first half of the album.  And, that's okay by me.  I'll save the fulllisten of the album for when I visit Scandinavia again.  Why?  Because this album feels like Scandinavia at its best--tranquil, classy, intelligent, and undeniably pleasant.  I've been to a number of cities in Scandinavia, but not Bergen, and I bet if I took the train between Oslo and Bergen this music would fit perfectly with the scenery.  Just buy the album and then hop on an SAS jet to Eirik and Erlend's home country.  Take a listen as you ride around the beautiful scenery and you'll see what I mean.  It's not a standout worth the 5 year wait, but it's still far superior to 99% of the music coming out today.

0307266303|4.0|I'm a casual runner. I used to run 2/3 times a week at most, but lately I was down to once a week, and some weeks I wouldn't run at all, because of injuries. I've had tendinitis in both my knees and in my right achiles tendon. My latest injury was PF on my right foot, and I couldn't make it go away, so I rested and took meds, and waited for a miracle.    I saw Chris's interview on the Daily Show and ordered the book from Portugal (I'm Portuguese). Two weeks later and my PF is 99% gone, just by changing the way I place my foot on the ground! This is amazing value and the rest of the book just came like a gift after that. I love running, but I never thought running could be fun, or easy, or smooth... but I'm getting there.     The stories in the book are great - although a bit long and rambling at times - but the real juice is in the reason why we are born to run. That is the most fascinating thing I read in a long time, and I'm still processing it.     I would definitely recommend this book for every runner out there that has ever had an injury. Read it and be amazed how simple it is to stay healthy and run longer and faster. My only regret was that Chris didn't add a section about running tips and diets - I really think it would be a plus, just 1/2 pages of that at the end. I really missed some pictures as weel, but that's what the Internet is here for: just google \\"caballo blanco\\"!

B00003CX9W|1.0|As a child, I grew up watching the \\"almost original\\" VHS copy of my favorite Disney film of all-time.    Since purchasing the DVD, I was thoroughly disappointed.  The redubbing of Deems Taylor's dialogue was blasphemous, and I'm sure that it could be easily restored with the technology we have today.  Also, another point of interest is the censored \\"Black Centaur\\" scene (talk about 'political correctness').  Hasn't anyone seen the recent \\"Donald Duck\\" and WWII cartoon shorts from the \\"Walt Disney Treasures\\" series?  They can at least have someone come on before the movie to warn those who may be offended by an animated African-American caricature.    All I can say is I hope Disney will have the common sense to faithfully restore the entire \\"Roadshow\\" edition on DVD and Blu-Ray next year for their upcoming \\"Diamond\\" release in Fall 2010.  Oh, I pray that the day will finally come!!!

B002OB9KPE|5.0|Yes, Transatlantic is back. Some people have complained that they have failed to 'push the envelope' as it were... while it's true there's perhaps nothing completely new here in the world of music, there's new things here that Transatlantic haven't done until now. Transatlantic isn't here to specifically redefine things, though all the artists within Transatlantic have done that to one extent or another with prog rock. Transatlantic is the combination of these prog 'titans' as it were, and the melding of all their influence is clearly seen. There's Neal's sound, Roine's sound, Pete's sound, and of course the Portnoy's drumming gluing it all together. What it results in is a solid album. It's not the same as SMPTE or Bridge Across Forever- and I love all those CDs. I'ts hard for me to rate it better or worse than those albums, so as of now I consider it certainly on par with the past work they've done.

0156034026|4.0|The urge to tell one's life story to a complete stranger is not unusual... although this one is on several levels. Changez, a young Pakistani, expounds on his experiences during his years living in the United States in greater and more intimate detail than one would expect (or be interested in as a listener). His monologue addresses an undefined American, maybe visitor maybe something else, to Lahore as they sip tea, eat dinner and watch the sun set, adding a special glow to the grand square... In between conveying the chapters of his story Changez, sensing an increasing unease in his counterpart, attempts to put his listener at ease: offering to switch tea cups or pre-tasting the food to prove no ill-will on the part of the waiter or anybody else.<br /><br />Changez - I cannot get away from the `change-ling' association of his name - was an ambitious and evidently successful academic immigrant to the US. Maybe, his success at Princeton and in a top consulting company has been a bit too easy to be believable.  He plays the role of the young executive with great style, always fitting in, until the events of 9/11 provoke him into reflections and doubts that will eventually lead him back to Lahore.  During his time in New York, he is infatuated by a beautiful blond intelligent woman.  He courts her gently and respectfully and takes the role of her confidante.  Realistic? I am not sure, but Changez eventually is carried away by his emotions resulting in expected as well as unexpected outcomes.<br /><br />Mohsin Hamid writes this monologue in a fluid, often beautiful and easygoing style.  Much more substance is hinted at than provided, leaving the reader with time and space for reflection on the attitudes of immigrants such as Changez attempting to fit in. Probably the most interesting aspect of the novel is the perspective from the outside looking in on American society and its values. (Friederike Knabe)

B000002HH9|4.0|The wild mood swings era had some interesting songs except that they never made it on the album, and also, the singles from the album were poorly chosen in my view.   Bsides now available on the Join the DOts compilation, such as the beautiful Ocean, Home, Waiting and the happy The Pink Dream should have definitely been on the album, at the same time, singles such as The 13th, strange attraction, and gone should have been relegated to bside material.   The first single should have been mint car, the following ones should have been This is a lie, Jupiter Crash, and Club America.   So, if you add the above mentioned 4 bsides and remove songs such as the annoying The 13th, Strange Attraction, Gone, Round & round, Return, Numb and Trap, you're left with an 11 song excellent album showing a pleasant evolution from what the cure did on Wish.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Had not heard of this story until offered on PBS.  Then, as usual, completely hooked by Dickens' characters, situations, performances, and outcomes.  An excellent cast, outstanding story of a family befallen with dire circumstances, and usual Dickens wonderful characters, settings, dialogue, and outcomes.  As in all Dickens pieces, viewers will love the ending.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this DVD based on some critical reviews regarding the quality of the earlier made videos, such as \\"Lucky Star.\\"  I found the DVD on sale for $20 and bought it anyway.  Personally, I think the quality is fine.  The earlier videos on the DVD are not much different than they are when played on MTV or VH1.  I really don't see much of a difference between these videos and those released on the earlier Immaculate Collection DVD compilation.  The sound is fine too.      I might be on a limb here, but I think the videos chosen for the collection are actually awesome.  The series includes the singly released hits, Justify my Love (otherwise only available as VHS) and What it Feels Like for a Girl.  It also includes other videos not released on earlier compilations, such as Burning Up, Crazy for You, and Erotica.  I think the inclusion of these videos really encouraged me to buy this collection.  The later hits such as 4 Minutes and Hung Up are also included here and are, of course, not included on earlier video collections.  The concert footage for Miles Away is also pretty cool and a nice precursor for the upcoming concert release of Sticky and Sweet.  The edits of Justify my Love doesn't bother me.  I have the VHS of that video and honestly, you're not missing much by this DVD edit.  I understand the ethical frustration here; but, if editing out nipples means that it gets released as part of a collection, I'll deal with the edits.      The order of videos is awesome relative to the CD that was released.  The only change I would have made would be moving \\"You'll See\\" to follow \\"Take a Bow\\" and pushing \\"I Want You\\" down a bit on the list.  I understand that the videos were largely ordered based on release date.  None-the-less, the continuity of \\"Take a Bow\\" to \\"You'll See\\" should have been preserved, as I see it.  As for videos not included, I would have liked to have seen American Life (the original) released with this collection.  I'm still not reallysure why it hasn't been released.  I've seen the video.  It's incredibly relevant and not insulting.  Maybe it'll be released on a later collection?  Whatever the reason for it's not being released, I believe that the current collection of \\"Celebration\\" is a must-have for folks interested in, not only Madonna, but the evolution of iconic pop from the beginning of MTV (80's) through to 2009.    Long story short - buy the DVD.  It's a nice addition, and not a replacement of, earlier collections.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This soundtrack blew me away. All of the music went well with eachother and the movie. I read others review claiming that \\"it was boring\\", \\"so depressing\\", \\"disappointing\\". What I say to them is get over it, the movie is mellow and sad and the music fits pefectly with the theme. If you don't buy this soundtrack, you are missing something wonderful.
1410409589|5.0|I read the sample of this book and it sounded somewhat interesting, so I bought the kindle version. I fell right into the story. I couldn't put it down. In less than a week I had read all 3 books in this series, thus far, TWICE!! It could have been proof read a few more times before being published and there were so many references to paintings, but despite that the whole series was a great read. The story was told from a few different character's perspective. The series takes place over a period of a couple of months. I won't get into details of the story as you can read the synopsis very easily.  Very much looking forward to the 4th book in the series, which unfortunately isn't out for about another year. Lots of humor and wise cracks in the book and plenty of action. The romance wasn't much, but it is a YA series, and the main characters are teens....I enjoyed it every bit as much as Twilight (especially New Moon, which I found to be quiet painful to read, but I trudged on through it so I could continue the series), maybe more. Even though I knew what was going to happen, the 2nd time around, I still found it to be almost as good as the first time. I don't normally go for this type of book, but I have to say it was definitely a very entertaining read. Very glad I decided to buy the books. Now I need to find another engaging series to read.

B000060K4O|5.0|One of the best ghost comedies of that decade, written by SNL funny man Dan Aykroyd and Harold Raymous, directed by Ivan Reitman.<br /><br />Three parapsychology professors get kicked out of a university just when they have made a great discovery of capturing ectoplasmic goo and whatever goes with it.  They decide to get a business going, called it Ghostbusters and prowl the streets of New York with a funky hearse with the license plate Ecto-1!<br /><br />Bill Murray steals the show with his wit and dry humor.  Sigourney Weaver flashes leg and blows her hair out -- \\"That's a different look.\\"<br /><br />An ancient Mesopotamian god takes over a skyscraper and with power wants to destroy New York and whatever else gets in her way.  Her destroyer:  The StayPuft Marshmallow Man!  Murray quips, \\"Hey, he's just a sailor visiting New York!\\"<br /><br />Sly commentary on government interference, bumbling cops and how the media can make anything popular just by putting their mark on it creating fake celebrity.  Or, maybe it's just a fun movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0021L8UPS|2.0|The Orphan is not a fast paced film, and the acting is not the best.  The real problem is that adoption procedure is not followed. The husband is to quick not to believe his wife when she says there is a problem (cliche).  When one child is threatened and terrified, he says nothing to his parents and continues to sleep under the same roof as the psycho.  Any child would talk rather than live with someone who puts a razor to his or her throat.  There are other holes as well.  It seems that wine sends people on an LSD trip in this movie.  The director did not research adoption or child psychology to make this film.  The movie is not believable. The viewer must look past all of the holes and simply be satisfied with a surprise ending (that really is not worth the price of this movie). The payoff does not save the film.  See it on cable.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Bublé's albums are usually packed with vocally complex versions of standards, this one has some nicely done but pretty simple tracks and I think that is why it went over big with my nephew. My niece (33 months) and nephew (17 months) were present the first time I listened to it, she danced a little but he just could not stop moving/dancing to it and smiling like a jack-o-lantern. He stopped in his tracks the second he heard the first note of \\"Cry Me A River\\" and was especially happy and wiggly during \\"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\\", he even swayed slowly with his sister during \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" but I believe his favorite was \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\". I enjoyed the music itself because let's face it... Michael Bublé's voice is amazing no matter what he is singing but my nephew's reaction to this album made it a real winner for me.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed Da Vinci Code but not Lost Symbol. Why? I don't know but it seemed too ludicrous. Way too many close calls that didn't make sense as if Dan Brown was trying to cram as much as possible into one novel. It fell short and was not even close to being believable. There were loose ends, fragmented chapters, characters that were able to make sense of symbols that weren't even close to sensible. Waste of money in my opinion.

B002TYZKIM|4.0|Going in, I hadn't really known what to expect, aside from his rehearsal footage. As it turns out, \\"This Is It\\" was what his concert would've been, if he had been alive to stage it. What stuck out most from the interviews was their dedication to their work, and it was because of Michael Jackson's direct and intimate touch with how he wanted his concert to be. Throughout the show, and since this was rehearsal footage, we got to see Jackson focus so strongly on his songs and choreography. The movie is a testament to his genius and poor substitute for what should have been the pinnacle moment of his career.    Full review at Yuhui's Movie Blogger: [...]

B002XMGGK6|5.0|What do you get when you take the disturbed genius from Seven, the sadistically brutal revenge from Man on Fire, the attack and subsequent vigilante justice from the awesome Death Wish Collection, and the structure crashing desire for anarchy from Fight Club? The product is the immensely enjoyable action thriller Law Abiding Citizen.<br /><br />When wealthy engineer Gerard Butler sees his family murdered as he lay helpless on the ground, anguish and pain rule his life. His lawyer, assistant DA Jamie Foxx, is a slick winner known for an extraordinarily high conviction percentage. Against his wishes, Foxx brokers a deal in exchange for testimony from one of the criminals. Predictably, the scumbag goes free early, and Butler is beside himself with disbelief when he sees his lawyer talking to the rat. Rather than go all \\"Time to Kill\\" on everyone, Butler decides to let the pot simmer deep inside. Fast forward ten years, and Foxx - now one step away from being the DA - must deal with a rich and vengeful Butler who has boiled over with rage at his misgivings with the U.S. legal system.<br /><br />This is one of those movies perfect for viewers who shut their brains off, or for those who must question everything. For the former, there is nonstop action, plotting, and awesome revenge that rivals the best vigilante justice ever seen. Butler is perfectly calculating, displaying what a resourceful person can do with no other true goal in life but to exact revenge and pain upon those who have caused harm. For the latter, it's an introspective look at crime, prosecution, and justice. Regardless of aspects that may be a little difficult to believe - but not quite Armageddon unbelievable - it definitely causes a viewer to evaluate the justice system flaws...while enjoying the Butler's wisecracks and richly deserved revenge that every family member who has suffered through something like the actions of this movie's killers.<br /><br />From top to bottom this is a very entertaining movie. It's not all explosions and shock scenes, nor is it a snoozefest. With great directing and acting, a concept with which most people can support, and a clever ending that is fair considering the protagonist dichotomy, it's easy to root for each side of justice, and each character's goal. And if that is possible, then the point being made in this film is successful. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Jason Elinxplosions and shock scenes, nor is it a snoozefest.

0307269981|2.0|I really enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo....I plowed through it in less than a week and couldn't put it down.  I had to read the Girl who played with Fire to get some answers that weren't addressed in the first book, but this book really let me down.  I don't know how to address the issues I had without specifics that might ruin it, but a good portion of the book is a plodding step by step discussion of the investigation which is pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.  Eventually the plot picks up but the majority of issues remain unresolved at the end of the book.  It could've used another 50-100 pages of time to resolve the issues raised and presented during the preceding 500 pages.  I may read the third once its released, but this was not nearly as good as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

While some of the anthromophizing is rather cutesy, the idea that an anmial can bring new perspective to a story for grownups has its own validity.

0553582038|3.0|I wish Mr. Martin had stopped at three. It seems as though the creative juices have abandoned him for the nonce. Perhaps he had, foolishly, set out a huge task for himself: seven books. Now he must fulfill it. It seems as though he is churning, or noodelling, like a composer in search of a melody. Why create a secondary, irrelevant character , like Brianne, and spend that much time on her? Why describe her futile search when the reader knows where Sansa really is? She is an utterly uninteresting character. Maybe Martin needed her to fill 100 pages. Of course a writer of Martin's ability can create an endless number of new characters with whom to populate the his next three books. The problem for me is that there are few characters left in whom I can invest any emotional interest, any real involvement. I no longer care. I cannot imagine how the heptalogy will end, but I suspect I will not care.    The worst criticism a writer can receive for a reader is disinterest and boredom. That is the message I would love to send via Internet raven to Mr. Martin. It is not too late to right the series: Do not bother outdoing \\"War and Peace\\", create interesting, believable characters, stay with them, and finish your work in the style you have started. Remember, \\"sometimes even the noble Homer nods\\"

B001AUKUSG|5.0|You can own this album for years,listen to it a lot even and I'll tell you:one of these days when your in just that certain mood it will simply whack you over the head! Next to Ray Charles,Sam Cooke and James Brown Otis Redding stands right in the same league as being one of deepest and most self expressive of soul's earliest interpretive singer/songwriters. Very few people I know other than Otis and those people could've written and sang the living end out of tunes like \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" and \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\". On these slow crawling Memphis soul classics the backup of Booker T & The MG's smokes,smolders and burns all the way down to the ground and just keeps going as Otis's voice expressess levels of extacy,pain and pathos that goes so deep into the gospel thing that you honestly except the man to keep howling \\"MY GOD ALMIGHTY!\\" at the end and,much as with Al Green after him who actually did, a lot of times it comes pretty near close. You'll get very little argument from me that this guy was definately Stax records' biggest soul innovator (Rufus Thomas doing the same on the funk end later),working not too long if not right along side the charts and radio with the soul masters that came emmediatly befire him. Of course this album in particular showcases him applying the same skills to purely interpretive singing,utterly individualizing the music of Sam Cooke on \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\",\\"Wonderful World\\" and and kicking n' funky version of \\"Shake\\",all of which take the intense gospel fire as opposed to Sam's drawn out and pleading style. The latter is particularly impressive as an uptempo tune. Considering Otis's obvious fixation on dealing with Sam Cooke material there are few better examples of Redding's flair with his material than these tunes. Most impressive to me is \\"Down In The Valley\\",usually done up as a very straight and ultra slow lullaby and here Otis's crawling,funkified rendition COMPLETELY alters the intent of the song into this broadly scoped southern gospel soul fave up that just gives you goosebumps! Otis's most well known composition from this album is \\"Respect\\". Now his original is equally as funky as the Queen Of Soul's however,there is a far heavier and slower southern flavor of course AND the composition itself is more obvious emphasized with more defined hooks and choruses;no \\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\\" on this tune-the man belts it out with the real deal and without any hint of cockiness. Despite obvious and sometimes cold blooded competition with Motown and Stax Otis pits himself up with David Ruffin on \\"My Girl\\" but on the other hand doesn't polish one bit of his performance. Otis crushes any barriers with BB Kings \\"Rock Me Baby\\",singing the blues with his own joyous flavors and making not only the song but the entire genre swing his way on this one song. \\"Satisfaction\\" takes the obviously R&B inflected Stones' original and totally Memphasizes it with horns and more of that gospel shouting. And to top it all off is William Bell's \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\",a fine almost Redding composition-like slow gospel soul piece again. One of the very finest examples of 60's soul one can find and key to just about any music collection.of the song into this broadly scoped southern gospel soul fave up that just gives you goosebumps!

They did a great job in putting together this movie: I am lost for words and I think they did a good job in portraying MJ.  Yes, I cried at  the end, for what could have been, I was left feeling like there is so much work left undone.  Talent like what MJ had is truely rare, or maybe we do not use our talent.  Highly recommend this dvd for all everyone who wants to be truely inspired by what talent means.

B000003TAW|5.0|There's a reason why this album has stood the test of time to become one of the era-defining albums of the 90s.  Besides having great songs, the album has an amazing sound.  Green Day might have launched the pop-punk frenzy, but it was Weezer's first album that truly created the sound of pop-punk and set the stage for emo with that famous crrruunch.  Thanks in no small part to Ric Ocasak (the singer from the Cars who produced the album), the guitars on the blue album sound trashy and heavy.  The beats are straight forward and the album is always chugging forward at an exciting rate.  If one is not paying close attention, it's easy to mistake this music for punk, metal, or at least something alternative.  But underneath all that noise and dissonance, this is nothing but a great, nay genius pop album, along the lines of a Beatles or Beach Boys record.  While most alternative bands at the time were more concerned with merging sounds and creating something heavy and different (Dinosaur Jr., Nirvana, the Pixies, Alice in Chains), Weezer were just writing straight-forward pop songs.  What makes it unique and stand out from the rest is that these pop songs have been given muscle and balls.  It's sweet sugar coated in a beautiful trashy metal exterior.  So the songwriting might not necessarily be anything we haven't heard before, but the way it's presented makes it sound not only fresh, but undeniably beautiful.  In this way Weezer stands alongside Phil Spector and The Jesus & Mary Chain as pop-bands that changed the way pop could sound.  Just listen to the opening crunch of \\"My Name is Jonas\\" or that wonderful low-fi blast of \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\\" and try not to be moved.  Weezer might have written great songs in the future, but they never were able to recapture this sound again, and that's probably why everyone remains so nostalgic for their past.<br /><br />(1) My Name is Jonas - begins with a gorgeous punk-folk like riff, dissonance and mic sound kick in before the guitars finally hit and Rivers screams quite amateurishly \\"My Name is Jonas!\\"  The song is probably the most \\"punk\\" on the album, and moves ahead straightforwardly.  The magic occurs in the bridge, where the same riff is played, but a noisy Nirvana-like solo is played over it and the drums start pounding heavier and heavier, so a certain melodic tension builds up and when it releases, its absolutely magical.  10/10<br />(2) No One Else - a very straightforward pop song but the lyrics are very childish and cute, even romantic in their own way.  \\"I want a girl who will laugh for noone else.  When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf.\\"<br />(3) The World Has Turned and Left Me Here - Beginning with a drum hiccup, the sound here is incredible.  Just trashy beautiful pop noise.  Then there's the lyric \\"The World has turned and left me here just where I was before you appeared and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face\\".  It's such a simple lyric but it's horribly, horribly sad.  The breakdown in this song where another coda-like chorus enters and Cuomo shouts \\"Do you believe what I'm saying Now!\\" is pure genius. 10/10<br />(4) Buddy Holly - Cuomo almost didn't want this song on the album, and you can sort of see why he might have been against it.  It's the most ordinary song here.  It sounds corny, like a rip-off of some old 60's rock tune.  And yet, for all its ordinariness, it's so undeniably catchy and so expertly written that it's impossible not to fall in love with it, from the very first listen.  You may not appreciate or like the song anymore, but can you deny the simple power it had over you the first three times you heard it and sung those lines with him \\"Wee oo I feel just like Buddy Holly uh oh and I'm Mary Tyler Moore.\\"  The synth line which leads into the chorus is one of the simplest and fabulous touches (especially and most effectively in that wicked bridge when everything quiets down for 2 seconds).  One of their biggest hits and the defining song on the album.  When people think of Weezer, this is the song. 10/10<br />(5) Undone - This is my personal favorite on the album, actually my personal favorite Weezer song of all time.  I've listened to it so many times that for a while I didn't care for it, but then after going back to it, even if it didn't have the same effect on me that it once did, I can't deny that it is the simplest and most effective song they ever wrote, both lyrically and musically.  It is just as beautiful, strange, and perfect as Radiohead's \\"Creep\\".  Just one perfect riff played over and over and over, a killer chorus, a scary breakdown, and an ending of strange high pitch feedback which only feeds into the feeling of the song.  But above everything else is Rivers at his lyrical best.  \\"If you want to destroy my sweater, hold this thread as I walk away.  Watch me unravel.  I'll soon be naked.  Lying on the floor!  Lying on the floor!  I've come undone!\\"  I think those are the saddest lines a man has ever sung.  10/10<br />(6) Surf Wax America - this is just a great pop punk song, and as cheap and one-dimensional as it is, it's written so well that you can't not like it.  This is everything that Weezer strived for with their their \\"pop\\" comebacks of The Green Album and Make Believe and Raditude.  The chorus sound like something the Beach Boys might have written.  10/10<br />(7) Say It Aint So - This is the song that everyone usually marks as their favorite at one time or the other.  The more you listen to it, the better it gets, and then it sort of peaks, clutches onto your soul and won't let go.  Rivers sounds sad and tortued as he mutters those three-word sentences.  \\"I can't confront you  I never could do that which might hurt you - try and be cool.\\"  The cathartic shout of the chorus \\"Say It Aint Soooo\\" is the sort of line that launches an emo-movement because it's that damn good and that damn sad.  But who knows what he's actually singing about?  The song hardly makes sense.  And that's partly what's so sad about it.  There's a certain personal ambiguity to it that most emo-bands forgot to learn from.

And yet it's the only time on the record where Cuomo stumbles.  That chorus \\"Only in dreams you'll see what it means reach out our hands.\\"  You have to admit, there's a certain lyrical and even musical weakness to that chorus, as if Cuomo just sort of came up with it on the fly and pasted it in to the song That said, everything else is take-your-breath away gorgeous, from the opening bass line, to the soft playfulromantic verses, to that two and a half minute cathartic build up which is nearly orgasmic in its release.

031606792X|5.0|1. I loved the whole Twilight series. Keep in mind that the books were designed for teens so when you see poor reviews from other people, it is probably from adults forgetting the target audience.   2. If you read passed the first book, Twilight, then you have to read all four books to understand the full meaning of books 2 and 3. Don't stop after book 2 or you will have misconceived ideas about the true identities of the characters.   3. Finally, Twilight the book is so much better than the movie, so don't skip to book 2 just because you've seen the first movie. It's not the same. Enjoy!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a great movie to introduce otherwise unsuspecting people about the food issues going on in the U.S. and other parts of the world.  I'm getting multiple copies to give to people who would be interested if they knew more.  In fact, I've actually threatened some people that if they don't watch it they won't be invited to my house for dinner anymore!    It should be required viewing for anyone interested in food, health and the environment.
B001L5U15M|1.0|I bought this bag specifically to carry two bodies while on a 10 day trip overseas and I'm sorry to say, the bag failed miserably. First of, the fact that the padded shoulder strap is not adjustable is fatal. Without the pad being able to move on the strap, there is no way to accommodate different sized people. I'm six foot and no matter how hard I tried, I could never get the pad on my shoulder. I ended up carrying two Nikon bodies, with lenses attached, plus spare lenses etc, for 8 hours a day, solely on the thin nylon strap, and I can't tell you how uncomfortable that is.<br /><br />The only way to get the pad on the shoulder was to hike the bag up high, but that brings up the second fatal flaw. The actual shape of the bag where the flap opens is a square edge. That means that with the bag riding up very high to keep the pad on my shoulder, there was no way I could negotiate the zipper around the square edge. It won't slide past that square corner. So you have to release the strap catch to let the bag slip lower and away from your body and, you guessed it, the shoulder pad is no longer on your shoulder. What good is a camera bag if you can't open it to get your camera out?<br /><br />And the third fatal flaw is the lack of a split zipper so you could try to open the top flap from either end. There is only one zipper, on the left and that is crazy. If there was a split, I might have been able to open the flap from the far corner. Maybe.<br /><br />And lastly, the internal dividers below where the bodies sit, only connect on two sides with velcro, and have a tendency to rotate vertically, because they're only anchored at either end, with no support in the side.<br /><br />While the construction quality is fine, this bag failed in the most crucial areas: comfort and usability. I mean, for a bag, what else is there? This is going in the trash and I'm getting a square traditional bag, the Lowepro Magnum AW. A sadly wasted $99.00.
1416594787|5.0|Dr. Richard Dawkins has done it again with his this book on evolution.   If you think you understand evolution this book shall open your mind to new avenues of thinking about evolution that shall allow you to better fend off misapprehensions propagated by the creationists and, in addition, firm up your own our own understanding of natural selection and evolutionary thinking.    These misconceptions run the gambit from \\"what use is a half of an eye?   Or, the specious argument that it is impossible for a complex organism to appear spontaneously, which by the way Dr. Dawkins agrees with and explains how the antievolutionists continue to misconstrue the science associated with these   arguments.    The reader of this book I think shall acquire a deeper understanding of the broader spectrum of sciences supporting the ideas of Darwin, from embryology to the organic chemistry of protein molecules, to the specious arguments surrounding the search for the missing links, et alia!

0307460444|2.0|I recently bought \\"Martha Stewart's Cupcakes\\" in time to make homemade cupcakes for a Halloween party.  Was I ever disappointed.  I was drawn in by the beautiful photos and creative ideas.  I made the Yellow Buttermilk Cupcakes recipe and it was terrible!  (I am a trained cook & baker).  It was soooo dry and heavy that I wish I didn't spend all the time and money in making it.  No one, and I mean, no one, touched it.  I ended up throwing all 36 cupcakes into the garbage.  I can't believe that anyone ever tested this recipe.  It was just awful!  What happened to Martha's \\"high standards\\"?
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see \\"This Is It\\" Friday night. I thought it would be a sad film, but was only sad to see it end. The depth of perfectionism and care that Michael put into his projects is amazing. He always gave 100% and then some in everything he did. I grew up listening to Michael, and like many others, was never fortunate enough to see him in concert. But I feel that he is a part of each one of us, and his legacy will live on forever. Thanks to Kenny Ortega for stepping up and taking the reigns on this movie. It gave us all a small peek into Michael's heart and vision, and we all feel that we know him better now. What a beautiful person he was - inside and out. Every person who had the opportunity to work with him, learn from him, should feel privledges. Awaiting shipment of the DVD as soon as it becomes available. God Bless.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I had the previous VHS version of this movie. When I was sent this movie to review, I was expecting the same. The  special features and restoration really made this come to life. I watched it with a three year old who tried catching the animals on the screen. It was a trip down memory lane; except this trip was way better.    The witch was so scary that the little one grabbed me and said she was scared. A little reassurrance, and some very cheery dwarfs later, and she was singing and smiling!     For me, this was just such a great experience, including the Walt DIsney discussion and games. You can enjoy it with a wide range of ages, or just by yourself.

B000FFJYB6|5.0|Willie is a lonely 9-year old growing up in rural Mississippi in the forties.  Then he meets his first real pal, his wonderful dog Skip, who gives him the confidence to make friends, play sports, and grow up.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever loved a pet will love this movie.  Just the title is enough to tell you it's going to be sweet and sentimental and it is, but not overly so.  Talented Frankie Muniz ([[ASIN:B00006G8J7 Malcolm in the Middle]]) plays Willie with so much innocence and spirit that you believe everything he does.  Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane play his parents and of course, there is Skip, the irresistible Jack Russell terrier who will surely melt your heart.<br /><br />Subplots including WWII, segregation, and moonshiners are all seen through a child's eyes and there is the same sense of wonder that made [[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird]] such a remarkable movie.  This is, of course, a tear-jerker but it's a good cry.  Highly recommended for the whole family.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Best T.V. Series I ever watched. Extremely disappointed that syfy didn't keep the show on the air. The movie is also excellent, but I really recommend watching the tv series first before watching the movie.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I am in no way a big fan of romantic comedies, but I found myself buying this film anyway. I had heard plenty of good things about the film (that I was very skeptic about)and these are two actors who I've got quite a bit of respect for. Most movies don't really get me to laugh. We're lucky if you even get a smirk out of me. Yet I found myself sitting on my living room floor laughing harder than I have in a long time. Now as for why I like this film:    There's something to be said for acting without speaking and Ryan Reynolds has this down. His facial expressions can tell some real stories.    I'm a fan of \\"The Office\\" and seeing Oscar in this role was a real treat despite how awkward it  was at times. But awkward in a funny/good way.    Betty White is her usual adorable self. I can't think of anyone else to replace her.    Sandra bullock did an interesting job of making an evil boss lovable.     The location was interesting. How many of these movies are set in New York or the Bahamas? Not this one.      No sex scenes. As odd as it is for an 18 year old to say, \\"I hate sex scenes,\\" I do. I want to watch a movie with my mom and not feel extremely awkward. Plus I find it really annoying when two people who hardly know each other are jumping into bed the first chance they get. I wouldn't really call that \\"Romantic\\". It just comes off as a cheap way to sell a movie. This movie had NONE of that.     And it isn't extremely predictable. I like to predict endings just from previews and I thought I had this one nailed, but 30 minutes in, I began to wonder if I bet on the right horse.     Now this isn't the kind of movie that's going to win awards for special effects or best musical number, but there's something about the simplicity that makes it all the more enjoyable. It really manages to stand on it's own.    Even my dad, \\"Hater of anything not made in the 70's,\\" was laughing with us.    You'll see what I mean if you decide to see it, and I hope you do.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|I saw this movie at the theaters when I was young child and was amazed at the special effects, when it came out on VHS I would watch it just about every Saturday morning. Now 25 years later I am still in awe of how good the graphics look for such an early phase of CGI and knowing how small of a budget this movie had.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is not a movie for small kids!  The sexual references are bound and swearing is all over.       But, I love it and if you kids are big enough it is ok.  Jessica is a caricature of the \\"ideal woman\\" at least the producers thought.  In any case make sure your kids know that she is not real and cannot be.  I do not like the pout and I would hate to think on how hard it would be to walk like that all day!    It had break through special effects and great acting to nothing, especially Bob Hoskins. His acting made the movie. Not easy to look at nothing an make people believe you are looking at a rabbit talking to you, but Bob Hoskins did it.      Just have fun.
B0029O08WA|1.0|Sorry, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that this was one of the most boring soundtracks I've ever heard. I loved the Twilight soundtrack (not a big fan of the movie, but love the books), so didn't hesitate to get this immediately. I figured the New Moon soundtrack would be more low-key, maybe even depressing, fitting in with the theme of the book. But, this was just boring to me - it didn't evoke ANY emotion, let alone the pain and longing that New Moon should. Very disappointing.

All the lies, the cheating and the CHARM!  I am now digging much deeper to the core of all the years of deceit and manipulation...It will be a long road (it is mental abuse), but understanding that they really have no remorse, no empathy, no true emotion, has really helped me move on with my life. I no longer question myself or feel the need to defend myself to his friends or family. They see what he wants them to see.  The \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" they know has presented constant BS to them about me so how can you blame them?  He is so convincing that I bought every line for the last 13 years!  This book is HUGE!  It is freedom to finally understand what you are dealing with.  Even professional counseling is limited because too many counselors are not aware of what NPD really entails. Unless you've lived with NPD, it is hard to understand. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in a rollercoaster relationship that never makes sense and causes you to question your own sanity.  It is so important to realize there is nothing you can do to change them so save yourself.  It takes time, it is truly painful to accept your life with them was built on a foundation of sand, but this book will help you heal.

B0021L8UPS|4.0|ORPHAN could be one of the biggest surprises of the year. Although, you may second guess yourself if you're planning on adopting a little Russian girl that speaks really good english and plays a really good tchaikovsky.<br /><br />Everybody does a tremenous job of delivering high-calibur performances including Vera Farmiga who gives a look into her soul as the movie plays out. At first, she's a woman who is desperate to ease the torment of losing her last child and eventually a woman who has to face the reality that the Orphan she thought would ease her pain becomes more and more of a mystery.<br /><br />Yet, it's hard to believe, as good as Farmiga was, that she could be overshadowed. Isabelle Furhman plays ESTHER, the orphan in question. She is gifted with emotions and timing that reminded me of Kirsten Dunst in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, and she's only twelve. It is always risky to cast children in such important roles, but when you find a good one like this, it certainly pays off.<br /><br />I would also like to acknowledge the even younger child actor, Aryana Engineer, who plays a deaf child that has to get a lot of emotions across without a word. Which is an even tougher challenge and she was a master. Maybe it's because she's used to getting emotions across with her eyes and face, because she is actually deaf in real life too.<br /><br />My only complaint about ORPHAN was that many times during the movie, the director went for the cheap empty thrill of cranking the music when somebody closes a fridge door or looks out a window to see nothing. Something that didn't need to happen in Orphan. The emotions that were trying to be achieved were don't perfectly by the actors and the cheap thrills stuff cheapened the movie.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The most recent incarnation of Beatles cd's is a very impressive sight. Great packaging, some cool extras overall a very worthy purchase. I was dumb and didnt pre-order so i had to wait almost a month to get it, but it was well worth the wait. Now, i got to read all sorts of reviews about this set while i waited and it has been quite a mixed bag. The audiophilles would rather listen to Let it be Naked or Yellow Submarine soundtrack from a few years back, because re-mixed is better sounding and more desireable that re-mastered. The Beatlemaniacs love it because its new stuff in new packaging. Some say it sounds better, some say buy the mono if you want a decent collection, some say its too loud a mix blah, blah, blah. (plus if i hear one more person with a $50,000 stereo system say go buy The Who remixes my head's gonna explode) Here's the straight poop people....if you love the beatles music and you are listening to the music for enjoyment and fun without looking for something that is 40 plus years old to 2009 technology perfect then buy this set. THE DIFFERENCE IN SOUND QUALITY IS NOTICEABLE...you can hear things you have not noticed previously and does sound crisper than its 1986-87 cd predecessors. Now as time goes buy and technology shifts again we will see this collection repackaged for the umteenth time and we will all buy it again..as fans thats what we do. If there was no improvement id be irritated.. but there is and its a great set start to finish.

He knew all his stuff, he knew what he wanted. You thought all the songs were old and basically the same thing, but in deed he was creating a new version for every single one of them he was about to bring to the world and his fans.

0684833395|4.0|A few years ago I attempted to read this book, but gave up after about 100 pages. I picked the book up again and finally I was able to read the entire book. The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that it took me awhile to get drawn into it. Overall, it's very well-written with a lot of subtle humor in it. The book can be a little redundant at times, but it's very unique. This is definitely a must read.

B0002B15XI|1.0|I always enjoyed the weekly television series MASH, so I was quite shocked to discover that the movie version of MASH is a piece of garbage, which is where my copy ended up. My first shock was to discover that the catchy little tune they play at the beginning of every show is actually a song about suicide being painless. Next, one of the characters is mocked for praying. The worst scene is where they mock the Last Supper during a fake suicide. Enough said!

0385040253|5.0|In case a beginner is considering this book, this survey of books on knot-tying might be helpful.  The knot hobbyist should skip this survey and just buy the book!    Just as there is no perfect knot, there is no perfect knot book.  All have deficiencies of one sort or another.   One common deficiency seems to be misleading or just plain wrong directions for tying a knot.  Another deficiency is a failure to tell the reader when to use a particular, or more important, when not to use it.   All the books suffer these deficiencies to one degree or another.      Another deficiency is too many knots!  But how could this be a deficiency, one might ask.  Isn't more better?  The answer is that the beginner needs to know the most useful knots that have the widest application.   If the book contains knots that don't have wide application but doesn't tell the reader which ones are widely used and which ones aren't, how is the reader to know which ones to learn?  Therefore, for a beginner, careful selection by the author is essential.     Budworth, The Complete Book of Knots    Of all the books, this is my pick as the best for a beginner.     What I like about this book is that it contains large, clear line drawings, and for the most part, the layout is pleasing to the eye.  Drawings are superior, in my opinion, to photographs.  One drawback of drawings is that the cordage you're trying to knot never lies as smoothly and gracefully as the one in the drawings.  (This tends to be true of photographs, too, however.)   But if you view the drawings more as a blueprint, then you get a conceptual understanding of how the knot is to be tied, and drawings allow a clearer conceptual understanding than photographs in most cases.    Another plus to this book is that most of the knots Budworth picked for inclusion are useful and often \\"best of breed\\" knots.  On pages 6 and 7, there is a \\"directory of knots\\" that shows the best or most popular use of each knot.  In addition, for each knot, there is a summary called \\"applications,\\" and occasionally a warning when not to use a knot.      A minus is that some of the drawings are wrong or misleading.  For example, in the drawing for the double bowline (figure 8 on page 37), the arrow to show how the working end is rove (threaded) through the loops would have the working end going from the top of the loops to the bottom when it should be the reverse.  After some frustration and referring to other sources, I was able to tie the knot.  (Google is your friend.)    A bigger minus is the terseness of the descriptions.  In a number of instances, the author assumes you should be able to figure out the process from fewer drawings than I think necessary.  I would like it if each and every step in tying the knots were shown.  With some effort, I was able to figure out each knot that I tried to tie even though some drawings included several steps in one drawing.  But why make the reader work?  A book for beginners should make it easy.    When I was starting with this book, I thought that it would be helpful if the author included pictures of the finished knot.  After about a week, I realized that he did!  But they are murky pictures that are either in a small space at the top of the page, above the name of the knot, or serve as a background for the entire page.  There is no excuse for such bad pictures, which mar an otherwise excellent layout.  Instead of putting some trivia about the history of the knot in a circle on each page, a clear monochromatic photo in the circle would serve the reader better.    The book does not include decorative knots (Budworth having written a separate book on decorative knots).    Because of the terseness of the descriptions, the lack of clear photographs of the finished knots, and the occasional errors, I downgraded this book from five stars to four.    Pawson, Handbook of Knots (expanded edition)    This book contains very clear color photographs, and the layout is quite pleasing to the eye.  The problem with photographs is that it can be hard sometimes to discern when one cord is on top of another or below, and sometimes the hand can be hiding some important information.  Compounding this is the fact that the book is small in format, and when you have four or five photographs on one page, each photograph ends up being small (say, 1.5\\" by 2.5\\"), too small sometimes.    Although the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding.  I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.    Pawson, like Budworth, is a founding member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers.  But his choice of knots puzzles me.  For example, he has a number of stopper knots but does not include Ashley's stopper knot, which many consider the most important stopper knot.  He also does not include any grip-and-hold knot (such as the midshipman's hitch, taut-line hitch, or the Tarbuck knot).  This is peculiar in that a grip-and-hold knot can be quite useful.  I almost had the feeling that Pawson had decided that he would avoid (when he could) duplicating what Budworth had done.    Quite gentlemanly, but not what I want in  a book for beginners.    On the plus side, Pawson includes a number of lashings, plaits and sennits, and splices, which Budworth does not.      For what it's worth, I was unable to tie the Turquoise Turtle knot following Pawson's description until I watched a video on the internet.      Based on the fact that this book uses photographs instead of drawings (particularly in a small format book), the sometimes odd choice of knots, and lack of warnings about certain knot uses, I downgraded this book from five stars to three.    The Morrow Guide to Knots    This book contains very clear color photographs, and the pictures are larger than in the Pawson book which is helpful.  But layout is off-putting.  There are typically several pictures on a page, but the picture on the top of the page is not the starting picture; it's the one on the bottom of the page to the left.      Like the Pawson book, the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding.  I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.    I found the choice of knots to be satisfactory in that most of the basic knots are covered.  A plus is that several ways of tying a knot is shown for several of the knots.  That is always helpful.  Another plus is that it covers decorative knots, such as plaits and sennits.    This book's depiction of the climber's method of tying the bowline knot took me an hour to figure out because two steps were (inexcusably) combined into one picture without an explanation.    A minus is that the book is outdated.  This comment would have come as a surprise to me before I started studying knots inasmuch as many knots are hundreds, if not thousands, of years old.  But a number of improvements in knots have been made in the last twenty years, and these improved knots can't be found in a book published in 1981.  Moreover, for the Tarbuck knot, the book states that the knot is used by climbers, but climbers have avoided this knot for decades because it tends to damage the kernmantel type of rope used in climbing.    Another minus is the paucity of information about the use and misuse of knots.    Based on the fact that this book uses photographs instead of drawings (particularly in a small format book), the odd layout, the lack of warnings about knot uses, and the dated nature of the information, I downgraded this book from five stars to three.      Budworth, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework    This book contains very clear color photographs, and the layout is quite pleasing to the eye.      Of all the books that use photographs to depict the tying of knots, this is my pick as the best.  Although the pictures are small, it's much more step-by-step than the others.  In particular, it doesn't suffer fromthe terseness of Budworth's The Complete Book of Knots, and it shows a large picture of the finished knot.  (It also correctly depicts the double bowline.)     An important plus of this book, given its claim to encyclopedic coverage, is the inclusion of decorative knots.  There are far more knots in this book than any beginner would need, and there is a paucity of information about the use and misuse of knots.    My copy has an update date of 2002, making it the most recent edition of all my knot books.      This book coupled with Budworth's The Complete Book of Knots would make a complete library for any beginner.  But this book is too much, in my opinion, for the ordinary reader who just wants to learn a few useful knots.    The fact that this book uses photographs would normally make me downgrade it, but number of step-by-step pictures for each knot offset that.  Based on the fact that this book is intended as an encyclopedia and it fulfills that function very well, I give this book five stars.  If this book were intended for a beginner, however, I would downgrade it to four stars because of the sheer number of knots, the lack of guidance to beginners as to which ones to learn, and the lack of warnings about knot uses (and misuses).  The number of ste-by-step pictures keeps it from going to three stars.    The Ashley Book of Knots    As an encyclopedic work, The Ashley Book of Knots is not suitable for beginners.  For knot aficionados, it's a must-have.      Based on the fact that this book is intended as an encyclopedia and it is in fact the standard reference work for knots, I give it five stars.  If this book were intended for a beginner, however, I would downgrade it to three stars because of the sheer number of knots and the fact that it was published in 1944, which means that it does not satisfactorily address modern synthetic ropes.    Conclusion    For the beginner, that is, for the reader who simply wants to learn a few of the most useful knots, my pickis Budworth, The Complete Book of Knots.  For an encyclopedia of knots, my pick is Budworth, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework.  For the knot hobbyist or public library, The Ashley Book of Knots is a must-have.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I wholeheartedly concur with all the wonderful comments of the other posters.  I have seen THIS IS IT twice in the theater.  I was at the first midnight showing on October 27, 2009.  Being I am a long time Michael Jackson fan, I expected to leave the theater in tears.  I really do love him.  Surprise!  He made me laugh with his lovely sense of humour.  \\"I'm sizzlin'.\\"  LOL!  You'll know what I mean when you see the film.  Once again, Michael Jackson gave me joy and laughter.  He delighted me.  It was a wonderful gift to see him up on the big screen, rehearsing, creating.  I LOVE his voice and I am crazy about his dancing.  I never tire of him.  He still had it.  He was a MASTER PERFORMER.  I am grateful that his fantastic dancers were there to cheer him on, what was to be, his final impromptu performance of Billy Jean.  I am excited about getting this film on DVD.  I hope they add a lot more rehearsal footage to the DVD.  I want to see more.  This DVD is  a definite \\"must have\\" purchase.  For long time MJ fans, your collection of his work is incomplete without it.  Much gratitude to Kenny Ortega and all that worked with Michael.  I love you, Michael. RIP
0756603749|3.0|Just as there is no perfect knot, there is no perfect knot book.  All have deficiencies of one sort or another.  One common deficiency seems to be misleading or just plain wrong directions for tying a knot.  Another deficiency is a failure to tell the reader when to use a particular, or more important, when not to use it.  All the books suffer these deficiencies to one degree or another.<br /><br />Another deficiency is too many knots!  But how could this be a deficiency, one might ask.  Isn't more better?  The answer is that the beginner needs to know the most useful knots that have the widest application.  If the book contains knots that don't have wide application but doesn't tell the reader which ones are widely used and which ones aren't, how is the reader to know which ones to learn?  Therefore, for a beginner, careful selection by the author is essential.<br /><br />Budworth, The Complete Book of Knots<br /><br />Of all the books, this is my pick as the best for a beginner.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that it contains large, clear line drawings, and for the most part, the layout is pleasing to the eye.  Drawings are superior, in my opinion, to photographs.  One drawback of drawings is that the cordage you're trying to knot never lies as smoothly and gracefully as the one in the drawings.  (This tends to be true of photographs, too, however.)  But if you view the drawings more as a blueprint, then you get a conceptual understanding of how the knot is to be tied, and drawings allow a clearer conceptual understanding than photographs in most cases.<br /><br />Another plus to this book is that most of the knots Budworth picked for inclusion are useful and often \\"best of breed\\" knots.  On pages 6 and 7, there is a \\"directory of knots\\" that shows the best or most popular use of each knot.  In addition, for each knot, there is a summary called \\"applications,\\" and occasionally a warning when not to use a knot.<br /><br />A minus is that some of the drawings are wrong or misleading.  For example, in the drawing for the double bowline (figure 8 on page 37), the arrow to show how the working end is rove (threaded) through the loops would have the working end going from the top of the loops to the bottom when it should be the reverse.  After some frustration and referring to other sources, I was able to tie the knot.  (Google is your friend.)<br /><br />A bigger minus is the terseness of the descriptions.  In a number of instances, the author assumes you should be able to figure out the process from fewer drawings than I think necessary.  I would like it if each and every step in tying the knots were shown.  With some effort, I was able to figure out each knot that I tried to tie even though some drawings included several steps in one drawing.  But why make the reader work?  A book for beginners should make it easy.<br /><br />When I was starting with this book, I thought that it would be helpful if the author included pictures of the finished knot.  After about a week, I realized that he did!  But they are murky pictures that are either in a small space at the top of the page, above the name of the knot, or serve as a background for the entire page.  There is no excuse for such bad pictures, which mar an otherwise excellent layout.  Instead of putting some trivia about the history of the knot in a circle on each page, a clear monochromatic photo in the circle would serve the reader better.<br /><br />The book does not include decorative knots (Budworth having written a separate book on decorative knots).<br /><br />Because of the terseness of the descriptions, the lack of clear photographs of the finished knots, and the occasional errors, I downgraded this book from five stars to four.<br /><br />Pawson, Handbook of Knots (expanded edition)<br /><br />This book contains very clear color photographs, and the layout is quite pleasing to the eye.  The problem with photographs is that it can be hard sometimes to discernwhen one cord is on top of another or below, and sometimes the hand can be hiding some important information.  Compounding this is the fact that the book is small in format, and when you have four or five photographs on one page, each photograph ends up being small (say, 1.5\\" by 2.5\\"), too small sometimes.<br /><br />Although the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding.  I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.<br /><br />Pawson, like Budworth, is a founding member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers.  But his choice of knots puzzles me.  For example, he has a number of stopper knots but does not include Ashley's stopper knot, which many consider the most important stopper knot.  He also does not include any grip-and-hold knot (such as the midshipman's hitch, taut-line hitch, or the Tarbuck knot).  This is peculiar in that a grip-and-hold knot can be quite useful.  I almost had the feeling that Pawson had decided that he would avoid (when he could) duplicating what Budworth had done.  Quite gentlemanly, but not what I want in  a book for beginners.<br /><br />On the plus side, Pawson includes a number of lashings, plaits and sennits, and splices, which Budworth does not.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I was unable to tie the Turquoise Turtle knot following Pawson's description until I watched a video on the internet.<br /><br />Based on the fact that this book uses photographs instead of drawings (particularly in a small format book), the sometimes odd choice of knots, and lack of warnings about certain knot uses, I downgraded this book from five stars to three.<br /><br />The Morrow Guide to Knots<br /><br />This book contains very clear color photographs, and the pictures are larger than in the Pawson book which is helpful.  But layout is off-putting.  There are typically several pictures on a page, but the picture on the top of the page is not the starting picture; it's the one on the bottom of the page to the left.<br /><br />Like the Pawson book, the book is soft-cover, the binding is stitched, and the book can be opened flat without breaking the binding.  I found that it would stay open without much difficulty.<br /><br />I found the choice of knots to be satisfactory in that most of the basic knots are covered.

0316035904|5.0|This was the first David Sedaris book that I had ever run across.  I didn't know anything about it, or him, when I picked it up - it just looked like an interesting, light read.  I couldn't have enjoyed it more!  What great stories and his delivery and writing style is unmatched!  Since that fateful day I have read every Sedaris book I can find!  I recommend them to everyone!  This book is still my favorite.  I re-read it every year for the holidays and I recommend that you do too!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Hello happy shoppers!    My name is Jenny Tolios and I have no social life!  As a result I spend a great deal of my time in front of my television set watching the brilliant, consummate, magnanimous, awesome and unmitigated genuis that is Supernatural! No, shoppers I dont just watch this series once or twice - I watch it over and over and over and over again!  So much so that friends are getting concerned that I at times blur reality and fantasy (so sometimes I call myself Mrs Dean Winchester - so what?!).    Unfortunately as I live in Australia the release date for these dvds was an unsatisfactory 6 months away - obviously NOT acceptable! If not for this incredible, stupendously innovative website, yours truly would have torn her hair out had I had to wait that long!    My order not only arrived weeks ahead of its projected schedule but, unlike other online buying sites, I got exactly what I ordered and it was in mint condition. I cannot praise amazon.com enough - they totally ROCK!    Looking forward to more online shopping!    Cheers,  Jen
B000EHRA48|4.0|I bought this cable so I could connect my MacBook(2008) to my Samsung 32 inch flatscreen. You need to also buy a DVI to HDMI cable, which I also got through Amazon. Here is the link for it: [[ASIN:B0007MWE1E Cables Unlimited PCM-2296-06 HDMI to DVI D Single Link Cable (6.56 Feet, Black)]]. This setup worked perfectly for me. The video quality is pretty good,assuming you are watching high-quality video on your computer. I noticed there are other more expensive cords, but I don't think there is a noticeable different in quality.
B002S0OBFK|3.0|I like to see the latest horror film at Halloween, the best of which in recent years has been \\"The Ring\\" [[ASIN:B000087RFC The Ring (Full Screen Edition)]], the horrifying story of a girl buried in a well whose spirit comes back to haunt everyone. This was a mystery wrapped in a horror movie that ended cleverly with a way to exploit the inevitable sequel to come.<br /><br />Another memorable film from recent Halloweenish releases was \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], the film that kicked off the reality in filmmaking style that \\"Paranormal Activity\\" copies. Blair Witch was, by any standard, a monumental success. It reinvented the horror genre and was the first reality film that confused plenty of viewers into thinking the events in the movie may actually have happened. A cleverly-designed Web site was the only way to determine if it was real or just the movies.<br /><br />Nothing about \\"Paranormal Activity\\" mimics the finer qualities of either of these predecessors from recent years. Like Blair Witch, this one takes place using a hand-held camera and is a cheapie made on the run by the filmmaker. The entire film takes place in a guy's home in San Diego.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the guy and his live-in girlfriend, who has been followed by an evil spirit since a terrible event in her childhood years. She seeks the advice of professsionals to rid herself of the spirit, and the boyfriend sets up the camera in their bedroom to record any untoward activity that goes on at night. The camera becomes the focal point of the film, as it records everything that goes on in the house.<br /><br />Spooky things do take place in this movie and sometimes they are effective. However, the movie takes at least an hour to really get going and, once it does, any horror film fan is going to guess what's going on through two clues the filmmaker's give about an hour into the movie. The action picks up after that but, since you already know how it's going to end, what's the point?<br /><br />This movie is about average for its style, I'd say. There are some nice moments and the acting is OK throughout. It appears they worked from some kind of script since none of the actors stumble over lines or get tripped up wondering what they were supposed to say. The nighttime scenes that are meant to jar you into gooseflesh work only about half as well as Blair Witch, in part because of the confines of the house.<br /><br />So chalk this up as another inspired attempt to scare the wits out of filmgoers at Halloween that missed the mark, in my view. It's a stylish attempt but one that needed more to go on the first hour to be effective and memorable. It also spoiled its own ending by giving that away in the final 30 minutes.int?

B0007XT87G|5.0|This is simply a great modern rock record that documents the band exploring a broad range of styles and moods.  The CD covers everthing from breezy pop to crunchy metal, introspective ballads to industrial grit.  The songwriting and playing is first rate througout, with many spine-tingling moments.  Favorite tracks include the pop/metal title track, the lovely ballad Lazarus, the extended-yet-focused track Arriving Somewhere, and personal favorite Start of Stomething Beautiful.  This is a powerful showcase of the band's strenths and a good introduction to their music.  Don't let the backhanded snarkiness of the Amazon \\"editorial reviewer\\" put you off.  The CD does not sound like Yes.  Or Rush.  Or the Mars Volta.  Nor does the CD show signs of of the band worshipping at the feet of anyone.  Nor is the average age of the band relevant.  You can safely ignore the buffoon and get the CD.

B002NXSRW0|4.0|I'm one of the rare 30something guys that didn't really play with GI Joes or watch the cartoon, although I liked the comics (Marvel and Devils' Due versions), which had a more mature, complicated presentation of GI Joe, so I came into the movie without a strong childhood connection.  I'll split my review into Plot, Characters/Acting, and Visuals/Action.    -Plot: First off, I could not help but notice how much of the plot was pulled from the Devils Due GI Joe comics; the nanomites and Destro's history are directly from it, which I liked because it added some extra depth. This is not a thoughtful, Dark Knight-esque movie, but a summer action film.  Despite that, the plot had some great twists and turns; character histories were also especially good. I liked the Duke/Baroness/Destro/\\"Doctor\\" connections, and the Snake-Eyes/Storm Shadow history was well presented.  What was best though, was the presentation of Cobra. these are not the incompetents from the cartoon, they are brilliant, clever, and vicious.  They actually destroyed the Eiffel Tower for crying out loud!  Most action flick villains aren't that accomplished, so props to them for being successful.  There's also the very nice setup for the sequel that actually got me clapping. The only thing I did not like was confusion about who the Doctor was; I kept confusing him with Mindbender.  Sometimes it seems they tried to stuff too much into the film, but overall it didn't drag.       -Characters/Acting: Getting some good actors helped out with this; Sienna Miller as the Baroness made the movie; she may not have had the accent, but the icy viciousness was there in spades, and makes glasses sexy.  I also liked Arnold Vosloo as Zartan, but he didn't get anywhere near enough screen time; hopefully that will change for the next movie.  The ninjas were both perfect.  As for Duke, I agree with others that he was pretty flat.  However, Duke was always the \\"good guy\\" who didn't really have a personality in the comics, soI partly think Tatum had nothing to work with.  The \\"Doctor\\" was on the other extreme; the Commander was always like that, but I felt it was done in a way that detracted, so the interactions between Duke and the Doctor were tough to take.  There were some good lines too; \\"Duke wasn't born, he was government issued!\\".       -Visuals/Action: Very nice.  The CGI looked pretty good, and the explosions were aweseome; the car chase through Paris was a particularly good one, especially the part with the train.  Based on that scene alone, you know chars definitely get hurt in this movie!  The nanomites were pretty good.  Fight scenes were great, although I felt the Storm Shadow/Snake-Eyes fights should have been better and longer; I actually liked the fight between the kid versions of them better; no holds barred there!  The girlfight between Scarlett and the Baroness should go into the Top 5 Best Girlfights of all time, and really shows off how the female chars are some of the most dangerous chars in the movie.            To conclude, GI Joe was an excellent action flick that contained some good plot (better than Transformers 2 anyway), did great homage/respect for  the established characters, and some very nice setups.  It's not thoughtful or brilliant, but does make for a good time.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I have twins...a boy and a girl.  They will not sit in anything...but this seat, they love it.  No longer any more screaming when we go bike riding.  I used to put them in the Chariot Cougar bike trailer.  They hate anything that separates them from us.  They love this seat because it puts them right in front of us, practically in our arms.  Now, they ask us to go bike riding and we sing and talk as we ride.  The seat is well cushioned, seat belt is well made and I feel very safe and in control having my child sit in front of me.  We have the Trek bikes and my husband took about 15 minutes to install each of them.  The only negative thing is...the description said that this seat is made for kids up to 40 pounds.  My twins are now 27 months and weighs 30 pounds each.  I don't see them being able to fit in it when they are 40 pounds.  Right now, they pretty much take up any space that is available between their seat and my handle bars.

B00006DEF9|5.0|bought this for my son who is doing this as their high school musical play. Funny because he didnt realize all the dancing! absolutley loves it and just happens to be one of my favorite movies.  one we will watch for a long time.
B000001FI7|4.0|This album seems dark and melancholy for the most part, but has a nice jazzy feel to it. I like the range of instrumental and electronic sound, somewhat similar to Massive Attack at times.  Beth Gibbons has a pretty singing voice, and the lyrics aren't bad.  The songs don't make you want to get up and dance or anything, but some are more relaxing and downbeat than others.  Solid album from a band not well-known in the U.S.
B002N15LFS|5.0|I'm pleased to say this album brings back everything I love about Wolfmother's debut album without making you feel like you're hearing more of the same.    I grew up listening classic rock and such and grew to love all the bands that obviously influenced Wolfmother. It's nice to hear a band stay true to their influences while still bringing something new to the table.    Cosmic Egg is a wonderful buy and a great album. I would suggest picking up the deluxe CD or the vinyl so you get the 3 extra tracks.    A warning: Note the track listing on Amazon. I believe that is the correct order. The order of tracks on the back of my cover for vinyls has them in the order they come on the deluxe CD (which I also purchased).
B000LC3ID8|2.0|I don't care how gory this film is, it still does not come close to the bloodbath at the end of Scorsese's Casino with the baseball bat thuds one of the all time squirm sounds.  Simple but true, fact is always worse than fiction.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|I wasn't a great fan of Radiohead, until I hear \\"In Rainbows\\".   The disc is unbeliveble. The best of the last years, for sure.
0739319175|2.0|I love listening to books in the car and for the first time ever, I pre-ordered this book; I should have saved my money.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this story most of it completely unbelievable.  Robert Langdon makes Superman and every other superhero look like a slackard.  Even Peter Solomon is heroic beyond description.  The time frame in which the story takes place is implausible as well.<br /><br />I wish I knew what went wrong...too many subplots, too much action, too much information about the Masons???  Who knows?  I was so glad when disc 14 ended; now I can drive to work tomorrow listening to Christmas music!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|My family and I have been waiting for yours to add this dvd to our collection.  I love the fact that disney includes not only the dvd but also the blue ray disk.  The price is great as well.  Very user friendly.  Loved by the entire family.  A must buy
1568987846|3.0|I was enchanted by the idea behind this book.  Having recently rekindling a passion for photography I was excited to be inspired by the simple images of two friends, miles apart.  I was a bit disappointed.  I am not sure why the publisher choose to lay out the book in this way. The majority of the photos are thumbnail sized. This defeats what I felt the purpose of a collection of photographs is. I would have gladly paid more for a thicker volume where each photo was large enough to have impact. But this book picks and chooses which photographs to highlight and even those are not adequate in size.<br /><br />I did like the simple pleasures and stillness that this book highlights. It inspired me to snap more shots of my daily routine as a window into my life right now, but the size of the photos was a huge hurdle.
1416972242|5.0|This was a beautifully written series. I was spellbound from the moment I picked the first book up. So many twists and turns and nothing was ever what it seamed. If you want something that will grab your attention and always leave you wanting more, this is the series to buy.
045122499X|1.0|An author who is obsessed with sexuality in a very disturbing way.  He also must have some axe to grind with the Catholic Church.  Don't waste your time.  I bailed after 80 or so pages.
031606792X|5.0|Even though I'm a few years older than \\"young readers\\", this saga was amazing.  The final installment \\"Breaking Dawn\\" tied up all loose ends expertly.  I'm only disappointed that there is not a Book 5.  Thank you Stephenie Meyer for giving the world a great love story.
B002H3F7F6|2.0|After I saw Sting on the cover of the AARP Magazine and Costco I knew it was all over. The promise, the literate musician touching the raw nerve of society's ways, the brilliant years, etc. Like Rod Stewart one can say these once prominent bright stars of popular music have accepted the senior moments with no regrets. He no longer seeks controversial, heart pounding sounds. Instead, like a long slide that started with the Fields of Gold mentality Sting no longer cares for cutting edge rock. He's gone the way of the banal, surely enjoying the rewards of his fiery days. One after the other this winter endeavor managed to bring a cozy but dark mantle over my all ready hot self. Now he is folk, now he is celtic, now he is the artist that will only stir the juices of the semi-contented, the eggnog by the fireside. So artistic that to this reviewer, knowing his past works and willing trajectory into the land of the semi-retired, millions set aside so whatever he does if just peachy, where you can drift into a winter's sleep with no possible return. Hey Sting, you use to be hot now you are not. The police and early solo works certainly his best moments. Like U2 that became David Letterman's sit in band and have sold all manners of their same in different packages but at the same higher price, these people no longer matter in the intrepid, no holds barred, cutting edge sounds that is what popular music is all about.   Now he is making music but for an entirely new audience. He is content with his state of affairs and he has no more to add to the struggles of modern life (spirits in the material world, invisible sun). Those days are Vamoos!   The first time I saw Sting was on the film Other Policeman's Ball? Here was this guy dressed in military tone clothing with just a guitar and a voice that shook the very grounds I was standing on. Roxanne and Just a cast away sending out I hope someone gets smart. I fell into a trance because so much of what he sang about I felt on a daily basis. And isn't that what it was all about? Musicians expressing, playing their heart out, earning their good money but never compromising the anger they felt. Once they become tamed to their existence, contented with all the reaped rewards of their talent they tend to sound less and less viable.  Please I need to buy another collection in a different package of the golden years of whatever band wants more money, nothing like the same song in 20 different versions, let's all go to the vaults these time for those rare mostly mediocre compositions (there was a reason why they remained in the vaults, come on people!) but now, they are not even dead and keep squeezing and squeezing till the fan, listener is saturated. What about music with soul, with a little adventure? I guess for that we must search long and hard and keep our ears close to the ground. Yes Siree, Sting in the Costco Magazine explaining how important winter is for him and his fellow musicians, all so far away and detached from a world that never ceases to shock and amaze. Just give me a minute and I shall grab my hot cider, put in my winter gloves and stir a log or two in this warm and friendly fire.   Where are the Pogues when you need them? Sting, Sting, all the yoga and environmental concerns have made you bland! 2 Stars for the once 5 Star!
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is one of the better books I have read.  The entire story is told from the point of view of Sophie Salmon (like the fish), a young girl who is horribly murdered, and is focused on her observations from heaven of her friends and family as they strive to make sense of this tragedy and to simply live their lives.<br /><br />The uniqueness of the narrator makes for an interesting read.  But this is not a crime story as I was expecting.  I have read more books in which the murderer is caught and, well, either killed or punished in some way and while this story did deal with the murderer himself, his capture wasn't the focus of the novel.  To me, in some ways, this was extremely refreshing, yet I am glad that it is addressed in the novel at some point.<br /><br />As I have a child of my own, my dear Natasha Bear, I can't imagine what ANY parent must feel upon the realization that someone has taken their child away from them.  The only thing I can do is to wrap my daughter up in my arms and, as she squirms to get away from me, to simply be grateful for the time we have together and to pray that nothing like this ever happens to her.<br /><br />I was enthralled by the book, but it didn't keep me up all night or invade my thoughts as to what was going to happen next.  I am yet unsure as to whether to go to the movie (or to watch it when it comes out on DVD) because I am sure that Hollywood will mangle it.<br /><br />Definitely a great novel.
0385504225|1.0|I am a huge Dan Brown Fan however, I did not like this book at all.  There was no mystery. It was very predictable and it made me angry that I had to read nearly 500 pages to read what I had figured out in the first few chapters.  I kept telling myself, \\"it can not be this obvious\\" and yet it was.      I loved his previous books, all of them, but this one did not leave me wanting me more. Sorry Dan!
0061231401|3.0|This was my first book by author James Rollins.  I picked up this book because the plot sounded interested and the book had good reviews on Amazon.  But I never really got into the book.  I felt that the book had some great setups, but what developed from there was only interesting, not great (though it felt as if the book had the potential to be great... hard to explain).
B001FB4VZS|5.0|My kids and I have watched this series together since Episode 1.  It was very entertaining. We found the best price on Amazon (better than Best Buy, Walmart, etc....).  Would recommend to anyone for family entertainment.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I quote:  \\"Why listen to The Beatles in mono?... It will provide a first-time experience of this magnificent music in mono-- the closest you can et to hearing the authentic sound of The Beatles.\\" Kevin Howlett... from the notebook insert.    This is the boxset to purchase.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|It comes to this. Ten years reviewing, and finally, I try to tackle the motherload, the crowned king. What is there to say? Why is it important?<br /><br />Why is it important may be the entry point for discussing Sgt Pepper. So much time has passed since 1967 and so very much has developed in music, hearing this today may make one ask, what is the fuss? It's not easy in retrospect to understand if you were not there. I was not and it took me awhile.<br /><br />Others who are my age or younger come up with counter-arugments, from the plausable (Freak Out, First Velvet Underground Album) to the insane (More of the Monkees) So, alright, let's get to it.<br /><br />It is not so much the songs on Sgt. Pepper that make this album so important. The Beatles could do anything as writters, and anyone who belittles their ability in this area is just not facing reality. And if you think of it, all Pepper is on the most basic level is a great collection of really, really, great songs. Even Paul McCartney discribes the Beatles to this day as \\"a great little band.:<br /><br />But if you listen to how the title track segues into \\"With A Little Help From My Frinds,\\" this was new. No one thought an album could have links.  \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" may have made a fantastic panio ballad, but the electronic keybords create a dreamy texture, and this texture is a blueprint for anyone who does space rock or ambient. Rock did not have to be about Bobby Vinton's puppy love. It could be about your sons painting, your first trip, your fever dream. This just had not been tried before.<br /><br />\\"Getting Better\\" is only a rock song, but may be the first song where Paul said \\"you know, John, if I take my finger and slide down my bass neck instead of lifting my hand, I get the coolest sound.\\" Maybe John said \\"try and match it with the vocacls, and not the drums, that may work.'<br /><br />Little discoveries by a young man trying the untested  becomes standard practice by the next year--only he does it ten times as good as anyone else.<br /><br />And he does it while singing \\"I used to be cruel to my women/I beat her and kept her apart from the things she loved/man I was mean but I'm chagning my scene and I'm doing the best that I can.\\" Rock songs did not talk about stuff like this in 1967--Vinton still had cupid songs on the charts--but here was Paul doing it, and man did it rock. Maybe he was getting better because he was fixing the hole where the rain got in--Two different songs, but the connection is iron clad.<br /><br />For the first  time you could  speak the silent. It really was alright. Things were now,  suddenly, different.<br /><br />Such were the times, and the Beatles nailed it. Seeing the mop tops with sideburns, mustaches and neon garb let you know that no, you were not imagining that strange \\"shift\\" that you may have detected  in 1967; it was tangable. Things WERE different. Pepper talks about it without talking about it.  With little Beatle crib notes.<br /><br />Listen to the heavy breathing that ends \\"Lovely Rita.\\" Did Rita give it up for Paul? Is he puffing grass behind her back? Is he marching at a demonstation while she arrests him? The Beatles may not have said the words recreational sex, LSD, Vietnam, civil rights, but this was all in the subtext. It was almost in everyone's drinking water.<br /><br />Either way, the breath made the  musical dynamics of \\"Lovely Rita\\" just SIZZLE.<br /><br />Need more: Hear how Paul snaps the words \\"had a smoke\\" on Day In The Life. He went into a dream, with all those holes John talks about. Artistically, the synergy is incredible, but this was really going on in the real world. The Beatles were just implying what was out there, but no one was talking about, on records.<br /><br />I could spin countless more examples, but hopefully I have made my point. It is the little details, the little comments the words make, the buried noises that were not part of rock before Pepper that make it so important. The problem is that all these moves are now such standard practice that we forget that Sgt Pepper is where all these rules came from.  Think you know all the rules, go back and hear Pepper again. Then again. Found something else? me too. Let's play it again. Wait..I heard something. Let's play it again<br /><br />Forty two years on, we are still doing this. We will never stop doing this.t Sgt Pepper is where all these rules came from.  Think you know all the rules, go back and hear Pepper again. Then again. Found something else? me too.

1563899426|4.0|It was nice to see grown-up versions of Snow White, Cinderilla, the Big Bad Wolf many other characters taken from childhood stories.  The plot was filled with intricate subtlties in addition to rhy references.  The artwork was a nice return to the old realistic, straight-forward style, but with a lot of care.  Not the blazare color scemes, extreme prespective and periscopic viewpoints of other modern comics. I plan to eventually buy and read all of them.[[ASIN:1563899426 Fables Vol. 1: Legends in Exile]]

B0000AUHPG|5.0|This movie is unbelivable as old as it is! You must, simply must, add this to your collection if you know anything at all about westerns. You will nerver forget it!! This is one of Sergios finest.  It will never get any better than this.
0061914177|4.0|Ever heard Gary Vaynerchuk speak?  Have you watched is Wine Library TV?  Gary is loud and excited and passionate about what he does.  That passion comes through his book.  He wants everyone to be passionate about what they're doing and so he gives step-by-step instructions in his book on how anyone with passion can succeed in business using social media.<br /><br />Gary \\"wrote\\" this book by dictating it (instead of typing it) and his voice and personality come through, making this a quick and easy read.  My only negative of the book is that I found the first 20 pages a bit repetitive on why anyone can use social media to be successful.  I think most people who pick up this book are interested in social media and so don't need so much convincing (that thread is there throughout the book).<br /><br />Overall this is a great book for any business owner who wants a road map on what to do to be successful with social media.  But, be warned, this isn't a recipe for overnight success.  It takes a lot of hard work and patience.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have seen \\"This Is It\\" twice now and it is truly a beautiful sight to see this incredible talent!  I feel a great sadness that such a gentle soul has left this, often times, not so gentle world.    Eileen

0765322889|4.0|A friend brought this book to my attention. I am a reader that gets bored very quickly, so a good story, with the right amount of character development is a must for me. It was hard for me to set this book down. I thought the story was wonderful (yes... I know it is about war, but oh well). To me, the character development may have been a little week, but it didn't take away from the book at all. I am ready to read the next book in this series, I hope it is as good as this one..
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Having seen this band on a semi-regular basis here in Vegas, I had an inkling of what this record was going to be like, but it also delivered a bit of the unexpected in the form of guest vocals by Justin Hawkins of The Darkness on \\"Party All Night, **** All Day\\". If you don't have a sense of humor or are easily offended, then move along. But if you can handle getting \\"punched in the n*ts by a dude who knows tai-chi\\", or if if you feel the uncontrollable urge to shout \\"Heavy Metal's Back!\\" on a regular basis, then you need to pick this record up. If it bothers you that his \\"heart belongs to you\\" but his \\"**** is community property\\" then pick up another disc. You can't be easily offended or faint of heart to listen to this disc - and it defintely helps to have a twisted sense of humor to enjoy it. Where sometimes I wonder how they don't crack themselves up with their schtick, they are four guys who can actually play -they're not just four pretty boys propped up with instruments simply because they look good. If you miss the days when Motley Crue and Poison were the kings of the Sunset Strip and Gazzarris' was their court, then this record is for you.
B00005GL0K|5.0|The Beatles' &#34;Please Please Me&#34; (1963) proved that the four lads from Liverpool would be around for the long haul. Opening with the breathless rocker &#34;I Saw Her Standing There&#34; and finishing with &#34;Twist and Shout&#34; (a remarkable first-take performance from John Lennon), the group's auspicious debut album still packs a sonic wallop. Along with &#34;Love Me Do&#34; and the title hit are Lennon-McCartney classics such as &#34;Misery&#34; and &#34;There's a Place&#34; — plus memorable covers of &#34;Baby It's You,&#34; &#34;A Taste of Honey&#34; and &#34;Boys&#34; (Ringo's first lead vocal). The original mono version remains preferable to the weird stereo mix. Shortly before his death, Lennon acknowledged &#34;Please Please Me&#34; as one of his favorite Beatle albums.
B0015435OI|5.0|The trio of Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley, and Beth Gibbons- known to the public as Portishead- are back with a new album, \\"Third\\". It is their first album in a long while. How long, you ask? Well, the last time they released an album, Bill Clinton was just starting his second term in office as the President of the United States...yes, that long. This album is noticeably different sonically. They rid themselves of the drum machines and the samplers that defined their signature sound and went with live instrumentation, which made them sound more darker and more menacing than they already are. Beth's voice is haunting on \\"Nylon Smile\\" and \\"The Rip\\". She's backed by a choir on the too-brief \\"Deep Water\\". Overall, this album is fantastic...and slightly creepy. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if any song from this album was used in a horror film, considering the overall tone.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved this movie.  As a Trekker who started watching this \\"world\\" with the original series, this newest entry was a wonderful blend of homage to the past while introducing great new actors in the classic roles. These actors made the characters their own, but conveyed the familiar personalities of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, Sulu brilliantly. I loved the meeting between Spock as a elder and Zachary Quinto's Spock. The door is open for new stories. I am looking forward to more from this cast.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw \\"This Is It\\" just last night, and, after being initially skeptical of the motivations of Sony for producing this film, I must say I'm quite pleased with the outcome and was joyous at its conclusion.<br /><br />\\"This Is It\\" honors and celebrates the final days of the preeminent uber performer of our time and captures his creative genius in a very poignant and heartfelt manner.<br /><br />In these rehearsals are Michael's clear energy, focus, and perfectionism- even after being absent from the stage for over a decade.  But also are the expected marks of a performer more seasoned, and perhaps even, just a bit older.  Yes, sometimes the moves were not as sharp, the voice not as smooth as the man of two decades ago.  But one really doesn't see much of that, especially when looking at a man who out-does dancers and singers, some more than half his age.<br /><br />It was said by some Sony execs that the world has missed one helluva concert.  After watching the movie, I can say I wholeheartedly agree.  But more, we miss the great souled talent who captivated us for forty-five years of his life, never stopping in his quest to entertain, enlighten, and heal our hurting world.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to adding this movie to my personal MJ collection, and believe it will provide closure, particularly to those hearts still wide open with sorrow at Michael Jackson's untimely death.<br /><br />It is indeed worthy.<br /><br />MJ, you are missed.
B002S0OBFK|3.0|I'm scoring this film 3.5 stars based on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the story behind it all.  My only disappointment is that the way it was released made it not at all scary for me.  I'm sure the 4 inconsiderate jerks 2 rows up who complained about how bored they were and tried to be funny through the whole movie didn't help either.  I mean don't get me wrong I jumped and had several Holy moley exclamations and one cover my mouth in sheer OMG moment, but I was expecting to be scared the way I was after Blair Witch (I still refuse to go camping to this day).    This is a movie that in order to get the full effect you have to go in with no expectations, with as little knowledge about what you are about to see as possible.  The problem for me was that ever since I caught the first glimpse of this on line I wanted to see it and I read every article and watched every trailer I could find.  I wasn't lucky enough to be in a market to see this early.  I was able to see Blair Witch before they came out and said it wasn't real.  I actually waited through the credits just to see that little disclaimer at the end that says it was fictitious(sp?).      I give it 3.5 stars based on it being a really quality horror film with genuine scares throughout, but as far as it being marketed as the scariest movie ever made?  Not even close.  I think if they had just given it a wide release and didn't hype it to death I could have seen it without knowing much if anything about it and I probably would have lost some sleep over every little bump or step I heard in my apartment, but I didn't.  This has 5-star potential but just doesn't deliver on the lasting impression.  There was too much \\"down time\\"  I found myself thinking \\"He got the camera to record the strange things going on at night.  Why am I watching them eat breakfast and not even talking to eachother?\\"  There was never any sustained fright or tension.  There would be a really good tense scary moment at night and then 10 minutes of them complaining about not getting enough sleep or eating or Micah playing guitar or Katie and her friend making bead necklaces.  The night scene would get me worked up and a little jumpy and nervous but then time to relax and not worry about anything until they go to bed again and by that time I was completely relaxed and settled down again.    Over all I'd definately recommend seeing it if you want to see a well made documentary style horror movie, but don't expect to be scared out of your mind unless you've been living under a rock for the past few months.  And don't bother with the DVD/Blu-ray release unless you have a good surround sound system or if you are curious (as I am) about the other two endings they didn't use.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I don't know how they do it but Season 4 of Supernatural is as good, if not better than the first 3. Angels, Demons, Ghostfacers...this series has genuine scares and yes, you will be shouting at the TV in despair (SAM!! - D'oh!!), but you will also be laughing too. The episode where the brothers discover a series of books have been written about them is just superb - especially the \\"slash\\" fan revelation...    Loved it, can't wait for series 5.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I'm ecstatic to see This Is It available for pre-order now!      The positive adjectives one needs to describe this film are limitless; amazing, awe inspiring, powerful, fantastic, and thrilling immediately come to mind.  Unfortunately, tragic and painful are also fitting and necessary.  When the knowledge sinks in that we are literally watching the last days of Michael's life, it is also a stunningly heartbreaking final encounter with the greatest performer who ever lived.     Michael's artistic talent and influence, his drive, vision, gentleness, courage, and devotion simply have no match in the world. Watching him interact with musicians and dancers is sheer joy. As usual, although there are many gorgeous and talented young people dancing and singing with him, it's simply impossible to take your eyes off of Michael himself when he is on camera.  He was pure magic, and true to form, he was planning the show of shows, a completely spectacular event. What a tragedy that all of those wonderfully talented people working with him will never fully realize their dream of a lifetime, to perform with the legendary Michael Jackson, and we will never see the finished product; the gift he wanted so much to give his fans and his children.        My only wish for this film is that it would never end. May Michael's urgent, lifelong message to Heal The World and nurture its children inspire each of us into immediate, positive action.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I like this movie mostly for the actors.  The story line could be stronger and less predictable, but it's still a fun romantic comedy.  Betty White and Sandra Bullock are hysterical--all of the actors are interesting and funny to see together.  Nice light humor to help you have an affordable laugh when money's tight.  Buy this and have a good laugh.  Great for a moms night out gathering.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I can't wait until this comes out on dvd.  This was the best film ever.  I wish so bad that Michael was still here to see how everyone has responded to this film.  I don't think he meant for this to be viewed, but I think he would have still been proud of the results.  I think Kenny Ortega did a great job as well.  I just feel really sad for all the people that worked for him when they found out the bad news.  I cried a few times watching it, but it was still phenominal.  I love Michael forever.  I will see him again one day.  May God Bless him and each and everyone of you.
0446579939|3.0|This was just a \\"so-so\\" story, in my opinion.  It was an interesting idea to begin with a search for someone in a photo but it seemed like the characters in the story were lacking something.  I don't think this was one of Spark's best books.  Perhaps he was going for a \\"Hallmark Movie\\".

B001CZVWIG|5.0|The music on this album is strangely gentle.     There is obvious musical, songwriting, and production talent between all of the members of the group (and producer), and yet there is a lot that the group seems to have yet to learn--which is actually intensely refreshing.     It's great to hear an obviously talented group in the stages of figuring out how to play together, sorting through their influences, and songwriting.     It's too bad this band has made only two albums. I would have loved to hear the outcome of their growth on subsequent albums!    By the way, the bonus tracks are great! :)
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was lucky to recieve an advance copy of this DVD/Blue Ray combo pack and I am glad I did because I don't know if I could have waited. I loved the movie as I child and I was excited to share it with my daughter. She is 3 and liked it (but we had to skip some of the scarier patrs, but she did not seem to notice. I also love the fact that it comes in a dvd/blue ray combo pack. I have been reluctant to buy dvd's lately because we will be getting a blue ray player shortly, so it seems like a waste, this allowed me to get a blue ray and also have the dvd to watch now. The quality on the dvd was great and we had a chance to watch the blue ray on a friends player and that was even more amazing.

With impressive style and clear and convincing explanations (for those who are open to them), Dawkins takes us on a fascinating journey through the evidence for evolution.  I think this should be required reading for every high school student

0061730327|5.0|Have you ever cried with joy? If not, then here's your chance. This tale, a true story of determination, conquering adversity and ingenuity lost and found in a hostile landscape, will make you cheer as you follow a young African boy who sets out to do the impossible. It's a story that well embodies the concept of \\"the audacity of hope\\" with no strings attached.    William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, son of a hard-hitting, heavy-drinking father who converted to Christianity after nearly killing a man in a barroom brawl. After the conversion, \\"the Pope,\\" as he was called by his buddies, became an exemplary, hardworking farmer who taught his children that cultural myths were important but that cultural superstitions would hold them back. His ability to laugh at superstition and prevail in the depths of adversity doubtlessly inspired his son, who grew to be a boy with a vision and an accompanying ability to get things done. And William's father respected that.    Forced to drop out of secondary school due to lack of money, William found comfort in a few books that he was able to check out from the library and read again and again. The most important of those was an American textbook called USING ENERGY, a book that he has said to have changed his life. Before he found the book, William was fascinated by principles of electronics and physics. But with the book, he was able to envision how to build a windmill to generate electricity, knowing that this simple intervention could change the lives and fortunes of his family. With electricity to pump water and light their home, the family would prosper and move out of the survivalist existence of the typical Malawian farmer. This was William's dream.    Having plenty of spare time, the boy began to forage in junkyards, filling his room with hunks of metal and skeins of wire that would one day be useful in fashioning his self-designed wind generator. After seeing William light a tiny light bulb with a bicycle, a local chief helped to bankroll this quirky project. With the funding, William was able to gather the pieces that he needed, and soon, the windmill, created out of junk, began to operate. The wind cooperated, and the whole house was electrified with tiny light bulbs. But tiny or not, it was more incandescence than most of the neighbors had.    Word spread about William's invention. He was asked by a local high school to help the children there make a windmill. Word spread further, this time to the media, and, suddenly, William's house had the attention of radio and newspaper people throughout the country. As can be imagined, William's genius caught the eye of people who had the power to help him. He wound up at a conference of TED (Technology Entertainment Design) in Arusha, where his simple device and his simple presentation earned a standing ovation. One of the first people to discover William's windmill and laud his abilities, TED blogger Erik Hersman, offered this wisdom: \\"Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles. Where the world sees junk, Africa sees rebirth.\\"    The fascinating saga of THE BOY WHO HARNESSED THE WIND is held together with the assistance of writer Bryan Mealer, AP staff correspondent and author of ALL THINGS MUST FIGHT TO LIVE: Stories of War and Deliverance in Congo. Despite his contribution, the flavor is pure African. William's relationships with his family, his understanding of tribal customs, and his viewpoint on contrasts between home and the highly industrialized Western world are described as he encountered them, in his terms. He talks about the entrepreneurial zeal of Malawian businesspeople who set up tables on the dusty streets and, using a single drop cord plugged in at a kiosk behind them, recharge cell phones and laptops and provide phone minutes and computer time...for a price. One can only imagine that people who create these services and those who utilize them would progress rapidly if they had full-time direct use of such devices as we Americans do.    At the time of this book's completion, William was attending the African Leadership School in Johannesburg, South Africa. His ever increasing knowledge of electricity and his willing funders had allowed him to vastly improve life back home for his family, with real mattresses, proper mosquito netting and malaria preventatives, full-scale lighting and a drilled well.    You can be sure the world is not through hearing about William Kamkwamba. Lucky world.       --- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a mistake to say that Firefly is new or revolutionary, since its key ideas have been print SF staples for decades.  What Firefly is, is ambitious and audience-centered in a way little TV sci-fi has been since the original Star Trek.  It anticipates a smart audience and rewards them with humane, high octane stories about clever characters in sophisticated situations.  So naturally it got cancelled.<br /><br />Dare I say that the best thing about Firefly is that it's incomplete?  Only fourteen episodes were made, introducing a story lush with promise and an energetic ensemble immersed in the kind of work that most actors long for.  It is this promise, unsullied by later network interference, which I think makes this the best TV to hit DVD in years.<br /><br />Beyond the writing, acting, and direction, all of which are superb, this show has some of the best visual design I've seen in decades.  Joss Whedon studied how space flight takes place even now, and reflected the cramped quarters, austere living conditions, and blue-collar immediacy missing from more slick productions.  Firefly is the latest true embodiment of George Lucas' vision of \\"used space.\\"<br /><br />Firefly didn't find its audience until it was out on DVD, but it's clear why this story inspires comic books, a feature film, fan fiction, and a massive fan culture despite its brief span.  For true believers in TV as art, this show sums up the promise that the medium rarely accomplishes.  Fun, funny, and energetic, there is no question why a cancelled show commands fan loyalty even several years later.

1588167461|3.0|Solid, if quite general, information on basic mens style. The writing is good, occasionally snarky, and the advice offered will still be relevant several years from now. The layout is well put together and the celebrity images run from vintage to recent. And I disagree with other reviews dismissing this range as dated. There is a certain classicism represented in the choices, and I appreciate a restraint which avoids too many trendy faces that will be forgotten in a year or two.<br /><br />Unfortunately what weakens this edition from four to three stars is the omission of any color photos. One cannot properly compare dark brown and black shoes in a B&W photo. A page that purports to guide the reader in pairing shirts, trousers, and jackets is ineffectual as a grayscale reproduction. Fashion in our daily lives always exists in full color, and any book claiming to be a style guide should mirror this reality.<br /><br />The publisher should correct this in future editions.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|more foreign movies on [...]<br />The movie won the Best Foreign Language Movie in 2007 Academy Awards and definitely deserves this. The beauty of the movie is the internal strife that Wiesler goes through when he starts this particular assignment. I had read a story long back about a Japanese interrogator who was a loner because he could look through people. And the story told about how his talent was his curse. Wiesler strongly reminds me of that character. The reason he feels so strongly for this couple suddenly even after doing so many successful assignments is because he realizes somewhere in between, that he is spying on two individuals who are not a threat as is made to believe. And his actions that follow which make him go through a series of terrible events but make him hold on to his values. Sometimes I get a feeling that maybe he is trying to atone for his guilt of the past or maybe his emotions let him to believe that if he can get it right just this one time maybe he will be forgive himself? The movie is a sensitive portrayal of the relationship between Dreyman and Maria and is beautiful in parts. Not a light watch and will leave you with some points to ponder. The last shot where both the characters acknowledge each other is very unique.<br />more foreign movies on [...]

B002TYZKIM|5.0|As we all know, just a short while before Michael Jackson and his incredibly talented group of dancers and musicians were to take off to London for his final series of concerts, Jackson lost his long battle with drug addiction and just like that, the candle that had burned for fifty years was snuffed out.  Michael Jackson was the entertainer of the century, maybe even the greatest entertainer of all times.  Hundreds of years from now, people will read passages about him in the history books: a man who revolutionized pop music, a man who furthered the progress of African Americans, and a man who danced his way into immortality.  However, sadly, he was not immortal.  He was a human being who struggled, hurt, and felt pain just like everybody else.  As you watch this movie, you see not the freak or wacko that people have made him out to be but instead the person who loved his fans and loved and supported the people he worked with.    The film opens up with dancers from all over the world sharing one thing in common: They are living the dream of working with the legend himself.  As the movie progresses we indeed see that Michael was a person just like everybody else.  Whether he has trouble hearing the music through his ear receiver, laughs at the jokes cracked by his sound producer, or encourages his musicians to play better, he constantly displays his strengths and vulnerabilities as a person.  Through out his career people either glorified him as a God or demonized him as a perfect embodiment of the overrated celebrity who craved attention more than love.  While Michael liked to show off his talent to his fans he really was a true artist at heart.  He was an artist in his innovations over what pop music was.  He was one of the first to really fuse pop music with visuals which gave us videos like, \\"Thriller\\" and, \\"Billie Jean\\".  Just as The Beatles revolutionized music in the 60s, Michael did the same thing for nearly three decades.    In the film, we see many classics performed during dress rehearsals.  Keep in mind that these are not always full songs and they often lack the energy of a full blown concert performance.  The purpose of this film is not to show a concert performance anyway.  One of its purposes is to show the behind the scenes aspect of the show.  You learn how the special effects team multiplies ten solders into ten hundred solders for the, \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" number.  You learn how makeup was applied to the dancers for the considerably updated performance of, \\"Thriller\\".  And much of the time you see Michael working tediously with musicians ,trying to get just the right sound for all his songs.  Another purpose for this film is of course to entertain movie-goers with the classic songs they've all come to know and love and to give them one final chance to see Michael himself perform them.  Classics like the 90s Hip-Hop style stompers, \\"Jam\\", and \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\", are here, as are the tender ballads, \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", and \\"The Man In The Mirror\\".  And what Jackson performance would be complete without the Jackson Five nostalgia of, \\"I Want You Back\\", and \\"I'll Be There\\"?  There is a little something from every stage of his career, so all fans young and old will find something here to enjoy.    The main purpose of this film, however is really to give the fans a final farewell to a man who died too soon.  An obscured cut off of his, \\"Dangerous\\", album called, \\"Gone Too Soon\\", will take on a whole new meaning, especially since his death simply did not have to happen.  What this film ultimately succeeds in doing is putting a human face on an iconic legend and showing us that even the most immortal figures in history were just as vulnerable as the rest of us.  Indeed you don't have to be a God to make a difference in the world.  I hope people enjoy this film as much as I did.

0143034901|5.0|There are so many layers, and levels, and intertwining stories within this book. The main story is begins in 1945 with a ten-year-old Barcelona boy, Daniel Sempere, being taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, by his bookseller father, to choose a book, which he must keep alive.<br /><br />Daniel chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax. The book and the mystery surrounding its author, who appears to have suffered his fate in a duel in Paris, soon infatuate him.<br /><br />Against the background of post-war Europe, and the fascist [Franco] state of Spain, Daniel grows up and discovers more and is horrified to find that somebody is seeking all of the writings of Carax, and burning them.<br /><br />The tension builds throughout the book, and the ending is far from disappointing. There are powerful messages, which have frightening echoes in the modern world. Political censorship is one of the intriguing threads. It can be as subtle as it can be obvious. There are also threads of evil, eroticism, psychic control, politics, real and fake friendships, and so much more. Apart from all of that, it is original.<br /><br />The book is so well written and translated. I wish that my Spanish was up to being able to read the original.<br /><br />Recommended to everyone, and it is one of those rare books that I would put on a pile to read again!

B002GU5V24|4.0|The Genesis box set releases continue! This time around, the band focuses on their live albums for this particular set, \\"Genesis Live 1973-2007\\". Four live albums: \\"Genesis Live,\\" \\"Seconds Out,\\" \\"Three Sides Live,\\" and a re-sequenced \\"The Way We Walk,\\" all remastered and remixed by Nick Davis, who worked on the band's previous box sets of studio albums. There is also an empty slot in the box to put in 2007's \\"Live Over Europe\\" (as the band wisely assumes that most diehard fans have already bought it), AND, as an added bonus, you get a CD and 5.1 DVD of the band's complete \\"Live At The Rainbow\\" concert from 1973! Also included is an excellent 52-page booklet, with insights from the band members, and wonderful photographs of the band taken from many years of live concerts. Overall, I'm very happy indeed with this live box set, but I still have to agree with other reviewers that \\"Live 1973-2007\\" still falls short of perfection. Let's briefly go through the live albums:    \\"Genesis Live\\"---the band's only proper live album with Peter Gabriel, recorded in 1973, sounds great, but it now includes 5 bonus tracks from the 1975 \\"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" show in Los Angeles, and they're not even in the correct order---\\"Back In NYC,\\" \\"Fly On A Windshield,\\" \\"Broadway Melody Of 1974,\\" \\"Anyway,\\" and \\"The Chamber Of 32 Doors.\\" On the one hand, yes of course it's great to hear some live \\"Lamb\\" material in this box set, but why not give us the *whole* \\"Lamb\\" concert? In fact, why didn't they just expand \\"Genesis Live\\" into a double album so it's now the complete 1973 show (and not just five songs), and throw in the entire L.A. \\"Lamb\\" show as a bonus? That, I think, would have been the much better way to go. (At least the whole L.A. \\"Lamb\\" concert---more or less---is available on the \\"Genesis Archives Vol. 1\\" box set).    \\"Seconds Out\\"---this classic Genesis live album, recorded in Paris in 1976 and '77 on the \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" and \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" tours, sounds amazing, and the slipcase packaging is excellent, but dammit, there are a couple of CD glitches: the second song on Disc One, \\"Carpet Crawlers,\\" starts to play, only to restart itself before it plays properly (the very beginning of the song is mistakenly attached to the end of Track One, \\"Squonk\\"---the CD player then switches over to Track Two and restarts \\"Carpet Crawlers\\"). The exact same problem happens again with the second song on Disc Two, \\"Cinema Show,\\" the beginning of which is mistakenly attached to the end of Track One, \\"Supper's Ready,\\" so it too begins to play, and then restarts itself. Sure, we're still getting the complete performances of both songs, as neither of them are chopped up in any way, but it's still an annoyance. May as well keep your old CD copy of \\"Seconds Out\\" until the folks at the record label can fix the problem, and I hope they do.    \\"Three Sides Live\\"---mostly recorded in 1981 on the \\"Abacab\\" tour, as well as some concluding live material taken from the \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" and \\"Duke\\" tours, this re-issue replicates the UK release of the album, and, once again, the sound quality is excellent, but I do have one very minor quibble---I always liked the album's concluding touch of hearing Ethel Merman singing \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" over the PA system as the album fades out, after the band conclude \\"It/Watcher Of The Skies\\". Alas, Ethel has been removed, and that's a shame.    \\"The Way We Walk\\"---recorded on the \\"We Can't Dance\\" tour from 1992, this a GREAT revamping of this live album, as the original release cut the album in half: \\"Vol.1: The Shorts\\" was all the shorter hit songs, and \\"Vol. 2: The Longs\\" was the longer, more art-rock sounding stuff. This new version of \\"The Way We Walk\\" re-sequences the songs in the correct performance order, and combines them into the complete double album that \\"The Way We Walk\\" should've been the first time around. There's also some extended bits of inbetween-song dialogue from Phil Collins that wasn't heard before, which is really nice. I couldn't be happier with this new, improved version of \\"The Way We Walk\\".    The bonus set \\"Live At The Rainbow 1973\\"---*of course* I'm thrilled to have a complete live concert of Genesis with Peter at the microphone, and it sounds awesome, but there's a catch: the 5.1 DVD has the complete concert, but the accompanying CD omits \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" and \\"The Musical Box,\\" presumably for CD time limitations, and also because the band didn't want to give us *two* live versions of the same song (there's still the live versions of \\"Watcher\\" and \\"Musical Box\\" on the \\"Genesis Live\\" CD). It's understandable, but it still ticks me off that I can't play the *entire* concert in my car or on my home stereo system, just only on my DVD player. Also, the CD of the \\"Rainbow\\" concert also omits some of Peter and Phil's inbetween-song dialogue with the audience. Luckily, some of the Rainbow material was previously released on the \\"Genesis Archives Vol. 1\\" box set, including Peter and Phil's spoken-word stuff. The only way you can have the complete Rainbow concert on CD (sort of) is if you splice together the Rainbow material from *both* box sets, and throw on \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" and \\"The Musical Box\\" from \\"Genesis Live\\" to fill in the gaps, and burn it onto a CDR for your own personal private pleasures. It's crazy, but I just might do it.     Insert your copy of \\"Live Over Europe\\" into the empty slot, and your Genesis live box set is complete!    So yes, I'm very happy with \\"Genesis Live: 1973-2007,\\" even though it's not a perfect representation of these live albums. It's still great that the band decided to give the live albums a box set of their own, and I will treasure it. But guys, PLEASE fix those glitches on \\"Seconds Out,\\" will ya? Thanks. Now, bring on \\"The Movie Box\\"....

B000JIHP88|5.0|Our daughter was about two months old when she started noticing movement and objects, and I needed a break now and again, so we started shopping for mobiles. I always liked the look of the Tiny Love ones, but the reviews were mixed and the Symphony mobile was out of stock just about everywhere, and in retrospect I'm so glad I got the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile instead.      We've been using this daily for almost four months now and haven't had to change the batteries yet.  Our daughter absolutely loves it - both the moving animals and the nightlight.  I love the four music selections, two volume levels, and the durability.  We're almost to the point where we'll be removing the moving part of the mobile, but the nightlight and music section will stay.  The remote control has enough range that we're able to use it from our bed in the adjoining room.  This is a great product - I happily recommend it to anyone who asks about it, and will continue to buy Fisher Price products.

It was an easy, fun read that I would recommend, especially to anyone who already liked Dan Brown's previous books. I find the reviews about him being a bad writer ridiculous.

0061730327|5.0|I instantly got a good feeling about this book when I saw the Amazon videos of William Kamkwamba and his windmill. When I got the book, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The first half really sets the scene. I learned much more about Malawi in several hours of reading that I had expected. The detailed analysis of the reasons for the famine - and its dreadful consequences - was gripping and shocking.<br /><br />Though I was waiting for the windmill bit, this backgrounding was fascinating in its own right. When the narration shifted to the conception and creation of the windmill, my pulse actually quickened. Such an extraordinary tale. Told so simply and humbly!<br /><br />I ripped through this book in just a few sittings. I immediately starting tweeting about it and mentioning it in my blog. It is truly inspirational.<br /><br />It's easily the best thing I've read in five years. Maybe even more. Do yourself a favour and check it out!
B001N26GFC|2.0|The story was plain boring, borderline \\"made for an Oscar\\" movie. Yes, we are in a time of \\"world crisis\\", so the solution is Poppy-me! The way to be happy-go-lucky is to have a drink in a bar, harass an unstable driver instructor, and find out what does make one a bully. Of course, then you shall find prince charming.     The only problem with the movie and the premise is that there are better movies with the same premise. I do rather go happy-go-lucky with Brazilian or Bollywood movies. Better plots, more fun music, and happiness having many more varied forms.     The actors were ok, the plot quite obvious, and the outcomes of Poppy's actions never lead to any conflict. There many cliches in the movie, but what would have made the movie better was if at all the character was lead to some conflict. Poppy's happiness is  kind of washed out, the happiness of people who have gone too far believing on something, and then look back wishing life was something else. As a comedy, the jokes are not very funny. As a feel-good movie, it just made me feel great: if someone calls this happy-go-lucky, then I should be joy-going-amazing ...

B000JMKNV0|5.0|I happened by this book in a different way. I was standing in a bookstore and saw Lehane's other book titled The Given Day. I picked The Given Day up to see if it would be something I would be interested in reading and saw Lehane's bibliography. When I saw that Lehane has written Mystic River (I have only seen the movie) and Shutter Island. The previous weekend I saw the movie trailer for Shutter Island and when I saw the same writer had written Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone my curiosity peeked.<br /><br />I then sent the samples for both Shutter Island and The Given Day to my Kindle and began reading Shutter Island, thinking that I would read it before the movie was released. Much to my dismay, I later found out that the movie won't be released until February.<br /><br />The sample of Shutter Island had me hooked and in no time I was downloading the full version.  I think that seeing the trailer to the movie helped me put faces to the characters.<br /><br />Overall the book was very enjoyable to read and I can't wait for the movie to come out. I had been reading the book so much that I was dreaming about the characters one night. In that dream I had a revelation as to secret that the book had.  I kept reading and reading in hopes that I would find out that my revelation was correct.  Just when I thought that my revelation was false I was reached the point that I had been waiting to discover and found that my revelation was in fact correct. When I reached the end of the book and set the Kindle down (at 2 am) I felt a tinge of sadness to have finished this story.<br /><br />Is summation, I wouldn't hesitate a bit to recommend this book to anyone that enjoys suspense and mystery novels. In fact, I even pushed the book to my wife's Kindle and got her to start reading it. More importantly, this book has turned me on to Lehane's other novels, to include The Given Day which I started reading this morning.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book before the movie is released.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|This movie was better than I expected filled with some sadness, lots of laughs. You leave learning a lot more about the man we call The King Of Pop.     If you can see this on the big screen in the theaters you should, because no dvd will capture all the energy coming throught the screen.     I love you Michael Jackson... and miss you with all my heart!
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Before this CD, I had never listened to a entire Michael Buble CD.  Now I want to go back and here more of his earlier work.  The first track \\"Cry Me a River\\" was the oddest song on the CD.  While normally enjoying different arrangements for familiar works, this sounded like the song had been turned into a James Bond theme song.  Unsuccessfully.  Soldiering on past that song, however, was rewarding.  \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" was great, as was \\"Heartache Tonight.\\"  The song that really stood out was \\"All I do is Dream of You.\\"  Quite a great little tune, and arrangement.  Just a great, feel good production.  \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is a little bubblegum, but still a fun, catchy tune.  All in all, I enjoyed this CD, and I will go back and listen to more of his earlier CD's now.
0385504225|1.0|This is a terrible book. I learned some things about the Masons, but that's not why I bought the book. I wanted to be entertained. This book is not entertaining. It is insulting. The story is beyond dumb.
1579128149|5.0|I had the author's poster of the periodic table first, and it inspired me to do a lot of reading on wikipedia.  I was excited to see the book was out, but what I didn't expect was that the author's voice is authentic, original, and funny.  A great launching point for further reading and thinking about chemistry, physics, and material science.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I love Walt Disney and love all of the \\"Classic\\" Disney movies.  This Diamond Edition on Blu-Ray and DVD lives up to the expectations that people view Disney movies.  I was very excited to receive this edition as were my two sons who also share the love of Disney movies as I do.  The quality of animation in the Blu-Ray movie is spectacular.  The sound quality is so excellent it was like sitting in the theater while watching in the comforts of home.<br /><br />This edition is loaded with many, many extras that are fun for the whole family, such as games, behind the scenes, karoke and more.  My family has spent hours exploring all that the Blu-ray edition has to offer.<br /><br />This is a MUST for everyone whether you have children or not.
B000ZELISO|2.0|Little magic. Little action. Less adventure. Most characters except Harry were in the background. The whole thing was a boring drama. By far the worst HP film to date.
0757302661|4.0|We just finished our second week of HypnoBirthing classes, I've read the entire book and have been practicing the techniques daily.  I'm 32 weeks pregnant, so I obviously haven't had the opportunity to put things into practice yet, but here are my thoughts so far:    The classes or book by themselves are not enough.  While there is overlap between material presented in class and material in the book, they are clearly designed to supplement one another.  I even enjoyed redundant material because our instructor presents information differently than the author.  Some things that weren't entirely clear from the book were easier to understand in class when we watched videos or were able to discuss the concepts as a group.    I agree with other reviewer's comments about the technique descriptions being vague.  This is another area where class time has been helpful for me.  We spend a considerable amount of time in class practicing the techniques with our birthing partners, while the instructor is there to guide and correct us.  I feel much more confident that we're doing things correctly versus figuring it out solely from the book.    If you have the time and money, definitely try to find a class.  If not, I think the book can still be helpful.  As with anything, it depends on the person.  For me, the classes have given me confidence that I'm practicing the techniques correctly and have definitely helped in releasing fears.  I would not feel the same had I only read the book.
B000024T5L|3.0|This 1991 CD by Europe was largely overlooked at the time of its release, possibly because its style of melodic hard rock did not fit with the grunge that was becoming popular at the time.  In retrospect, it holds up fairly well.  Unlike previous releases, most of the songs were co-written, so the album is more eclectic.  Some of these tracks are quite engaging, with clever hooks and pleasant vocal harmonies.  The arrangements favor the guitar; the keyboards are kept more in the background.  Standout cuts include Seventh Sign and Girl from Lebanon.  The remaining material is quite listenable.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Great movie full of action that actually has the dialogue to keep the audience interested. Great storyline, very well written. Has the dialouge and action, suspence to keep the audience interested and to want to watch it again!
B00002663R|5.0|I'm truly pleased with this product.  It arrived in good condition and the CD plays beautifully.  It's always a tremendous honor and blessing to hear Michael's voice.  I love him, very deeply and miss him endlessly.

B002Q4U9YU|4.0|This Is It is an album compiling the songs of Michael Jackson's songs that were to be done in his London Concerts, and is presented in the order they were to be performed.  My one complaint is that these are the studio versions that many fans already own through Michael's albums instead of something new or updated.<br /><br />I am disappointed that they did not include a bonus disc of him singing these songs live in his rehearsals.  Having seen the This Is It documentary it was clear that Michael was singing all his songs live, even while dancing (he often got out of breath) and a live Michael album is what I think fans would really need.<br /><br />That being said this album does have some good new things.<br /><br />This Is It - a sweet, moving ballad by the late King of Pop.  Probably not good for casual listeners, but if you're a devoted fan such as myself you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Planet Earth - the first time we get to hear Michael reading his poetry aloud.  It really shows you the deeper side of Michael's personality; a side we often didn't see.<br /><br />We then get some demos of his classic songs, the best of which is the demo for Beat It; just fun to hear Michael doing the tune and words all by himself.<br /><br />This is a good collector's item, but don't expect much new if you already own Michael's previous compilation albums or records.<br /><br />Remember to always think of love - L.O.V.E - when listening to these songs!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just saw the movie and like some have already said you leave the movie with happiness and sadness. Happiness because of the pure GENIUS MJ was and sadness because he didn't even make it to opening night! OH how I wish he could have it least performed it live  once!! You can tell the show was going to be SUPERB. All that hard work had to come to a screeching halt with MJ death. EVERY entertainer today should see this to see how a pure GENIUS plans a show. He put his hand on EVERY PART of this production. And how humble he was and nice he was to  the everyone he worked with. I CAN'T WAIT until this comes out on DVD!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This Is It shows that to the very end the King of Pop possessed all the elements that made him a superstar.  Here we see the preparation for his ill-fated London Comeback, but even though we all know how this story ends you can't help but smile when you see Michael in his home element and just having fun.  The most intriguing part about this documentary is the lack of actual Michael Jackson dialogue, but you can totally feel in his expressions the gears that work busily within; he was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster into this final effort to thrill the world.<br /><br />This is Michael Jackson unlike he's been seen in years.  Here he sings all of his songs live, even fast-past ones such as Jam, They Don't Care About Us, and Smooth Criminal - this element also really shows the fans how truly exhausting it was for him to put give the crowds dancing and singing, and this footage makes it obvious why for the Dangerous and History tours he had to lip sync several faster numbers.<br /><br />Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).<br /><br />Highlight performances of the rehearsal are definitely as follows:<br />They Don't Care About Us<br />I Just Can't Stop Loving You<br />I'll Be There<br />Thriller (totally new production than the one used in Dangerous and History tours!)<br />Beat It (first time in years I've seen him do the dance same as he did in 1982!)<br /><br />The others are good as well, but none of them are nearly as crisp, or polished as those numbers of the rehearsal.  Key point of this rehearsal footage is getting to getting to hear him sing his hits live, and it would have been better if the This Is It album included those instead of the studio versions...Also, Michael's new female guitarist is great (on the eyes and on the ears).<br /><br />Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).  So in fairness it isn't at all an MJ concert experience, but it does have all the elements of one.<br /><br />The tagline of \\"Get to know the man you never knew\\" isn't really accurate because there's very little of actual Michael Jackson dialogue outside of seeing him say \\"God bless you\\" to everyone in the production team and noting when he thinks something needs to be changed about the way something's being done.<br /><br />All and all this is probably going to be remembered as being the greatest concert that never happened in the history of music.  From these few, vague snippets of what the actual This Is It concert we can see that Michael would have had a huge comeback through this concert series, and that once more he has proven that he was, and always will be the King of Pop.<br /><br />It is a reminded, that even though tabloids tried to cast him in evil light, Michael Jackson's ONLY message was one of love.  L.O.V.E. plain and simple.MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).

B0029RQE84|3.0|The album itself is excellent (as just about everything MK does is), but there is little on the bonus DVD to recommend it over the regular CD version.  Contrary to the track listing here on the Amazon page, the DVD does NOT contain any interviews with Mark or the band.  What it does contain is:  1. a video of the band playing an acoustic version of Cleaning My Gun in the studio (fairly interesting, but not a particularly notable performance, in my opinion);   2. a video of the photoshoot (Mark is not exactly a beauty queen or a teenage starlet, so I am not sure if this will be of interest to anyone).  The rest of the DVD is filled with Mark and Chuck Ainlay (the album's producer) walking around the studio and bragging about this or that particular piece of recording equipment that they've managed to get their hands on. If you are seriously interested in the technical aspects of the recording process, you will probably find some useful information there.  Everyone else will probably be better off getting [[ASIN:B002ELM5HY the regular CD version]] and then downloading two Amazon-exclusive bonus tracks, [[ASIN:B002OUO6Z4 Early Bird]] and [[ASIN:B002OUT4S8 Time In The Sun]].
B001FW58D6|5.0|I didn't think sci-fi could ever excite me again after the X-files went off the air then, I discovered Fringe. OMG! I love this show and I am enjoying the sexual tension between Peter and Olivia. It reminds me so much of Dana and Fox from the X-files. I couldn't wait for them to hook up either. I just know it's going to happen for Peter and Olivia too! The actor that plays Peter has been redeemed in my eyes by his role in Fringe. I couldn't stand him after he betrayed his friend in Dawson's Creek. I just didn't like him in any of the movies he made. Now, I just love him! The mystery surrounding his existence is so exiting! Is he from the other side? How did Walter Bishop accomplish that? I can't wait to find out!. I love, love, love this show!!! Please keep the episodes coming!
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|I really didn't know exactly what to expect upon watching this raved abou new release of the timeless classic Snow White.  It came just in time, as I had only recently finally purchased both a big screen HDTV as well as a Blue Ray player to accompany it.  Growing up, Snow White was one of my all time Disney favorites.  I hadn't seen or heard of it for quite a while, as Disney had locked it up in it's vault for years, I suppose awaiting a future opportunity to rerelease it in some yet unknown magnificent form.  Well, magnificent it is and what an extreme pleasure to be able to share it with children unaware of the story.    The state of the art  blue ray technology is breathtaking!

B002436WFI|5.0|As a fan of everything Discworld, I really really enjoyed this film. It has the same wonderful magical feel that Hogfather did, and the same splendid attention to detail, for which my appreciation knows no bounds. It is really a treat to see this world come to life, and to know that it is in the hands of someone who not only loves and cares about the books and characters, but who gets the author involved as well.     I was very happy to see Terry Pratchett and Nigel Planer (who voiced a great number of Discworld audiobooks) in small roles in both this and Hogfather. Sean Astin was cute and innocent as Twoflower, David Jason great as Rincewind (though a tad older than I'd always imagined Rincewind being), not to mention superb performances by Tim Curry as power-hungry wizard Trymon and Jeremy Irons as cool-as-a-cucumber Vetinari (ooh, that Vetinari..)    We also get to see the Luggage come to life as never before, and I feel they got its homicidal nature spot on!    All in all, a lovely, thoughtful and fun combination of the first two Disworld novels. I can't wait for more!
B002S0OBFK|4.0|When a supernatural presence begins to plague a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), they decide to capture their experience on video.  This film purports to be assembled from their recordings.    This movie really benefits from the \\"found footage\\" approach taken by writer / director Oren Peli.  In fact, this film would not be scary at all if it were shot in a more conventional fashion, since for most of its length the paranormal activity is confined to events such as moving doors and chandeliers and bumps in the night.  The video format, however, gives the story an immediacy and a verisimilitude that puts the viewer right into the story.  Events build slowly and culminate in one supremely creepy evening.  This film stayed with me longer than more spectacularly gory offerings.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Despite my title for this review, I basically enjoyed the movie.  The cinematography is excellent; the acting competent and the special effects...well...they look like special effects.<br /><br />On the other hand, the movie was a combination of predictable and unbelievable.  A child and an English lady...almost miraculously...turn out to be great drovers and, working alongside the leading man, bring 1,500 head of cattle to market despite pursuit by baddies who stampede the herd and even poison water wells.  The film is also totally Hollywood and politically-correct.  Australia, it seems, is eaten up by racism...except, that is, for our leading man and leading lady.  The racism theme is used time and again in the movie.  Our hero, heroine and the aborigenes are noble.  Predictably, almost everyone else, isn't.<br /><br />In case anyone misses the point, the heroine's [Kidman's] husband or father [I missed the first few minutes] has been murdered by an aborigene spear...but, as we learn to our politically-correct relief, the weapon was really a decoration wielded by a white bad guy. Hollywood.  When will the producers and directors grow up?
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List effectively captures on film, the depiction of one of the most horrific and unconscionable events of all time - the Holocaust. Even through one of the darkest eras in human history, there are those who lifted their hands in quiet, skillful defiance and offered a glimmer of hope and pockets of goodness that continue to reverberate from generation to generation. Oskar Schindler was one of those people.    Based on a true story and shot entirely in black and white, Stephen Spielberg shows his brilliance in directing this dark and moving classic starring Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, and Caroline Goodall.     The story begins with Oskar Schindler, a penniless Nazi, and his dream of making a fortune from cheap labor found in the Ghetto - a place where Polish Jews were exiled by Nazi Germany. There they were placed into poverty after being ripped from their homes and stripped of their possessions.    As time goes by, Oskar Schindler begins to see a different side of things and finds himself deeply affected by the unjust torment and murderous acts carried out against these innocent people. Incrementally and progressively, he steps out onto a path to save as many people as he can, but must find a way to avoid the cruel and unforgiving transgressions of the German army, else death will come to him as well.    Judaism is the central religion of the Jewish people. It is derived from Hebrew beliefs and practices set forth in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), also known to many Christians as the Old Testament. Their ancestry stems from the tribes of the Children of Israel. Being one of the oldest surviving monotheistic (one God) religions, Judaism considers divine covenants as their foundation. With a covenant being a contract between the Jewish people and God, many felt betrayed and abandoned during the Holocaust.    This film is equally inspiring and disturbing. Spielberg has accomplished another masterpiece and forever etched the tragic images into our minds, lest we shall never forget, and nor should we. This movie is highly recommended and should be viewed by all mature audiences everywhere. With great confidence, I can easily say Schindler's List is the best movie I hope to never see again.
B002NPUCRQ|1.0|Yeah, Taylor sounds alright in these songs, but have any of you heard her live? She's terrible! Also, her songs are so juvenile. Outside of the teenage girl demographic does she have any fans? Sorry, Taylor, I can't relate to being \\"fifteen\\" (a song on the record) and having a boy tell me they love me. I really don't get how she's so popular. She's smart though to re-release her album to make money off her fans that snatch up anything she does. Good thinking TS!

0385504225|1.0|I was as excited as the next guy for this book, and put other books aside to read it. Bad move. I haven't taken the time (and won't) to really analyze why I feel this way, but the truth is that I got about 100 pages in, to the place where the hand on a spike shows up, and couldn't take any more.    The story plodded along, and it just wasn't the page turner I wanted (it's 2am, then 3am, then 4am and you're still reading and you KNOW you have to get up at 7). The evil tattooed assassin was just too weird, and his brand of violence came through as needless and gratuitous. There's probably people in this world who are just this weird, but I don't want to know about them.    When the hand appeared, I said, \\"enough!\\" and put the book down. I wasn't grossed out; the story was just too weird. My wife read it next, and although she finished it, she didn't think that I had sold the book short.    One star, and only because I can't give zero stars. Dan Brown, you have just lost this reader. This book is a real stinker!
B0027ZEHGO|4.0|Many Americans will be surprised to learn that there's a whole range of opinions and experiences regarding healthcare (and other issues), outside our borders, that we're not exposed to.  In fact, we're rather aggressively shielded from the outside world. Some would have you believe that the world outside US borders is all some huge socialist hellhole.  Of course, few of those folks know (or care) what the word 'socialism' actually means.  They're simply carrying water (knowingly or not) for the US insurance industry.  This movie attempts to expose American audiences to a small slice of the large reality outside of our carefully sheltered experience.  Moore uses the same story-telling devices he uses in all of his movies, some of which I find slightly annoying, but I applaud his message whole-heartedly.  He's a good man, and a patriot in the true sense of the word.

B00102F5WK|3.0|Extraordinary rendition as a tool in the war on terror and its implications for due process and the rule of law, the issue of torture, and the fundamental problem of individual rights versus public safety are all serious and important topics that deserve a better treatment than this movie. Actually, the brief documentary about rendition cases which accompanies the movie on the DVD does a much better job than the movie itself in addressing these issues.  The cast represents considerable talent, and the acting is just fine. The problem is with the writing. This would've been a much better movie if it had focused on the rendition case itself; instead, that almost becomes a sideshow in the drama of the subplot involving the interrogator's daughter and her boyfriend. It is understandable that the writer felt the necessity to include a real terrorist plot alongside the extraordinary rendition and torture in order not to be accused of being completely one-sided, but this dilutes the impact of the rendition story. And in the end, the rendition plot is \\"solved\\" in a very unsophisticated manner. So while being mildly entertaining, this film was a disappointment overall.
0061537969|4.0|I started this book and which was a book club selection.  It started slowly but a friend said, \\"It gets better.\\"  It truly did and I thoroughly enjoyed the book with its unique storyteller.  Definitely worth the read!
B000WC3A0S|5.0|One of the best saga out there! It is among my favorite! Watch as Rocky Balboa goes from a small time slugger with the payroll of a street fighter, to a celebrity boxer, to a normal citizen. And realize, through all of these phases of his life, he remains able to do what he needs to, to move on. To keep on moving forward. Stallon is a genius! This is a must for anyone who ever felt down and feels that beast inside of them...driving at them and pushing them. You have to keep moving forward! And no one knows that better, than my friend Rocky!!!
0385340575|5.0|Two things made me hesitate to pick up Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher novel, Gone Tomorrow. The first was the memory of the 12th entry in the series, Nothing to Lose. It was a different Reacher novel, one with a message that hit the reader over the head. The second was that I had heard that Child phoned in this installment. I wish that I remembered where I heard that, as I want to point out that this Reacher novel is as good as any Child has written.     Reacher is traveling through New York City on the subway early in the morning. At that hour, there are only a few people on his car. Of those, only one deserves his attention, and that is because she appears to be a suicide bomber. Reacher, familiar with such things, is comparing the Israeli Counter Terrorism's list of eleven behavioral indicators against the woman. She has set off quite a few red flags. Reacher approaches her, explaining that he is a policeman, and attempts to reduce the threat by calming her. However, she pulls out a gun and kills herself. Interviewed by the FBI, NYPD, and Department of Defense officials, Reacher is asked if she passed him anything. To the Feds, he makes it appear as though he is in possession of something, as he feels that he owes the woman, since he probably should have given her more time, in retrospect, before approaching her. While Reacher has two groups of the Federal Government pursuing him, and the NYPD, there is another group that wants the information, and that group is much more vicious and motivated than anything the US Government can throw at Reacher.    Lee Child has crafted an excellent Jack Reacher novel. In addition to bringing the reader into Reacher's world, where he sees everything but looks at nothing, Child incorporates a realistic premise which keeps the pages turning. Readers familiar with the Reacher novels know that once he is involved in something, he will see it to the end. And dispense his own brand of justice, if necessary. Playing on Reacher's lackof permanent address, Child allows him to move from one location to another fluidly, investigating the reasons behind the suicide. However, Reacher has quite a few groups interested in his interaction with the dead woman, some may not be as they seem, which add to the suspense and thrills. If you were disappointed with Nothing to Lose, Gone Tomorrow will reaffirm your confidence in Lee Child and Jack Reacher.     Already writing the 14th installment in the series, I can't wait to see where Reacher surfaces with his worldly possessions (ATM card, out-of-date passport, and toothbrush).

B00171LFFU|5.0|I just received my copy of this Japanese Remaster of Moondance one of my very favorite records/CD's of all time (top 5).    I really did not think I was going to get this great album/CD remastered in my lifetime for the reasons mentioned and because of Van himself, who is the real culprit, if you read the full history. I understand what the other reviewers are saying.    The bottom line is that as soon as I put it on my top notch stereo system I knew it was remastered properly.    I compared it to the earlier Japanese remaster and to the original. Night and day.    The bass is now present. The output EQ in db's has been significantly raised and it sounds just fantastic. All the instruments are present and the detail is stunning.    I bought it from the Japanese Seller which worked well.    Do yourself a favor if you have been waiting a lifetime for this CD to be remastered properly and buy it. I have waited a lifetime and I for one am grateful!
0061122416|1.0|I wish that while wondering in the Desert, the little shepherd boy was magically transported to Arrakis (Dune) and swallowed by a sandworm. Personal Legend meet Shai-Hulud. What annoying drivel Paulo Coelho spews. At least with a story like Slumdog Millionaire ones gets the sense of the gross improbability of it all. According to PC all you have to do is pursue your dream--what utter crap.    This book may be useful for a teenager contemplating suicide, but beyond that, turn it to pulp for some other more worthy publication.

0307269981|3.0|I enjoyed this book and thought it was for the most part well written and entertaining, but the last 1/4 seemed very contrived. It was as if he wrote 3/4 of the book having no idea how he was going to end it, then just figured it out in a hurry to meet publication deadlines and came up with an ending that just came short of qualitgy of the rest of the book. Everything was truncated in the ending and happened to quickly without sufficient background or logical progression to what did happen. The book was still worth reading, but a disappointment. Everything left incomplete in the end. If it was intended to whet my appetite for a third book in the series I think it failed.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|How does this happen? they spend 15 grand and it rakes in 78 mill at the box office ,don't you wish you could do that? the trailer is so hyped it makes you wanna see it real bad ,naturally you don't go in expecting much because you anticipate it will be garbage .but i gotta admit ,for what it is ,it's pretty darn good ,yeah ok, it takes off slow ,but it does build up .and what's with the 2 endings? there's a theatrical ending and i hear there is some other ending we will be able to see later ,probably as an alternate ending when the dvd comes out .  i say watch it ,and make up your mind for yourself ,scary or not ,this one won't be ignored !
1905654294|5.0|I loved this book! It was my favorite in the Twilight series.  I really wanted a happy ending and wasn't disappointed!  The details were beautifully written.  I felt part of the story.
0312370849|4.0|This book is written in a simple language, maybe too simple but that's OK since I've read books which tested my knowledge of the English language with every sentence and weren't enjoyable the least.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable book nonetheless.  The story revolves around the French roundup of Jews during WWII.  A little girl, named Sarah, which escaped death and the search for her little brother whom she locked in a cupboard before the French police took their family away.<br />Very sad even if it is a fictional account (I hope).<br /><br />The second story takes place much later and revolves around an American woman living in Paris, married to a French man, who discovers Sarah's story and researches it while discovering, of course, a connection to her husband's family.<br /><br />The first story, the one about Sarah, is engaging, flows and is very touching.<br />The second story - not so much.<br /><br />However, I did enjoy the book very much even though I think story number two could have been more engaging with more dimensional characters.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I love all of mastodon's albums.  With each release they just keep getting better and better.  This album is a departure from their previous releases, they omit the screaming with singing.  I was a little weary at first, cause every band that stops screaming usually come out with a crap record, (trivium, the crusade sucked, but shogun blew my mind away) this isn't the case with mastodon.  This album shows the band really does have talent, with amazing vocals and very well crafted guitar riffs and amazing solos.  This album is really chill and spaced out to listen to, amazing with weed.  I highly recommend this for any true mastodon fan, or for anyone who likes heavy rock. ( i don't consider this a metal release, i mean it technically is, but its sound a lot more like a heavier rock n roll then metal to me). P.S. i'm a dude using my mos account
B0006AAS5G|3.0|I'm an Invicta fan and I purchased this watch with high expectations. In the end though, I had to send it back and look for another model that was more functional. Despite what other reviewers have said, I was unable zero out the sub dials even after reading the (generic) instructions several times. If it can be done, it certainly should be easier to accomplish. Ultimately, the real deal-killer was simply my inability to read the dial. The face is very attractive but  the white background  and light colored hands and hour markings are a bad combination. Both are \\"luminous Tritnite\\" which is an off-white color in daylight. There just isn't enough contrast between the white face and the off-white hands to see what time it is at a glance. Other manufactures have pulled off that color combination much more effectively (for instance the Rolex this watch is designed to look like). If you've got eagle eyes and prefer fashion over function, this is your watch!

B002V33ZLU|1.0|This show to a simple point is drawn out and boring. Here's why. 1st off this seems like a soap opera and the only thing that makes me remind that it's sci-fi is the fact there is a ship that seems to be in the background somewhere. 2nd these stories are drawn out and terribly slow paced with no action and it really feels that the story could have been collaged or told in 2 min. I'm for stories that are character driven but if they want good character writing and clever lines look at Smallville. Anyway I knew this show would bomb after hearing they where stuck on a ship moving through space with no way home felt like star trek voyager, anyway I thought after watching the first 3 episodes which was incredibly boring to seat through I thought I would give it 5 episodes to get better and I watched the 6th and I'm like, this better not be dragged out all the way to the end of season one like this. I'm only holding on b/c it has Stargate attached to this series and if I was a new comer I would have thought it was a reality show if it wasn't for the ship in the background and incredibly boring one to. Oh and btw I most say something about the sex scenes in one of the episodes. It wasn't even necessary. It seemed so cheesy and out of place its like they thro it in b/c they new the show was boring and incredibly dull they wanted to wake you up and put some spice in it and make you remember your watching a story. Sighs. Note to mention it seems that the doctor is from \\"Battle Star Galactic\\". Anyway this story series is a pass. But on another note I well say one thing great. The ship is interesting looking. The Kino Balls that float for exploration was cool. and the Cameo from SG-1 was nice and just to through in my 2 cents just for the hell of it I'm hoping they have a goa'uld mole among them. I think that would wake up me up and viewers who are already falling asleep from this show. I'm going to hold in a few more epps and see if I well still be awake or fall alseep dreaming of better days of Stargate.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater is my favourite band and this is the first progressive album I ever listened to. So the equation is resolved, this is the best metal album for me, as I am a true progressive fan.. What can I say? A masterpiece in his genre for sure, and a very great album to listen whatever you appreciate progressive style.    Higly and deeply recommended to all!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I'm a bit partial to Mark Knopfler having listened to him and gone to several concerts over the years so take this as a biased review.  Hard to imagine it's been almost 30 years....    I don't think it's ever wise to make a decision on Mark's newer recordings until you've had about 30 days to enjoy it, takes that long to fully appreciate the stories.  Naturally the first song to grab my attention was the scrappy \\"Cleaning My Gun\\". Gonna might need bullets - I love that phrase.    Mark's specialty is telling musical tales and I think my favorite here is \\"So Far From The Clyde\\".  Since we all tend to apply human qualities to inanimate objects, this story of the scrapyard demise of a ship from the once proud Clyde River shipyards is something we can all relate to.  Great, great, and sad story.    My wife likes the title track \\"Get Lucky\\".  She was trying to get my 14 year old son to listen, saying there's something special about it's clean simplicity.  He called it \\"old peoples music\\".  I don't take it personally, I just interpret the word \\"old\\" as \\"seasoned and discerning\\"......
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Very good CD, one of the best rock CD I've ever listened to, heavier than a normal rock recording but still amazing; there are heavy songs like Ties That Bind and very melodic and amazing songs like Blackbird or Watch Over You tham will make you listen to this album many times.    Recommended for both metal or rock listeners, very good work!
B00007GZR5|5.0|I remembered seeing the previews for this movie before it come out in the theaters. I was thinking about how colorful and magical it seemed.   I didn't see it in the theater but finally saw it on DVD when it came out.  Yes, this movie is so vividly colorful and amazing.   But on the flip side, it is profoundly sad and gut-wrenching too. I ended up having to stop watching it half-way through and come back to finish  watching it a few hours later.    One thing that bothered me though was the discontinuous story-line. It was often hard to follow as the story seemed to jump around chronologically  and some of the situations were confusing and unclear.    But all in all, I did like the movie and found it amazing to watch. I would recommend it. I think its a good example of \\"love conquers all\\" even through  heaven and hell and the afterlife.
B000063DFQ|5.0|In my opinion this is the album that best represents the band, heavy riffs, melodic and catching songs, appropriate lyrics and all the features that made Iron Maiden one of the greatest bands ever appeared in the musical scene.    Must-buy for all!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved this film. The entire world reacted to Michael Jackson's death. There have been countless tributes, many tears shed, many books written and/or re-released, many Facebook groups and websites created in his honor and an inestimable amount of media time in the form of news articles, interviews and analyses about Michael Jackson and the Jackson family since he passed in June. The emotional grief reaction to his passing on a global scale, has been unprecedented.<br /><br />I am so glad to see this final tribute to his life. As I watched, I could feel the love in the editing. Mr. Kenny Ortega did a wonderful job crafting together this beautiful quilt of a movie with love and devotion to his friend's spirit.<br /><br />This movie has helped to clarify Michael's legacy and messages of love for each other and caring for the planet. This movie has raised the energetic vibration of the earth in a time when it is so needed. It was uplifting to see someone in the public eye behave so graciously and politely to others as he worked, as today, it seems to be accepted to be rude to others and to get one's point of view across at any cost.<br /><br />It is so bittersweet, as Michael himself wanted to deliver this message, and of course, the live performances would've been spectacular.  But that was not to be, God had other plans. I was so glad to see this artist in full maturity, delivering entertainment, yet so much more in his final message of unity and conservation.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Using the word *comeback* would do Michael a disservice. He was always here, just awaiting his return. \\"This Is It\\" only reminds us of Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent and overpowering persona as a master musician, musical genius, showman, creative mastermind and genuinely humble, funny and loving person.     This is a remarkable movie, astounding sound and wonderfully edited. We are treated to dress rehearsals and song rehearsals for Michael's London shows, getting a peek at what would have truly been the greatest concert ever produced and performed. Michael re-imagined \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" while also giving us staples like \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\" \\"Wanna be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Human Nature\\".    While Michael looks underweight in some scenes, he is still clearly in top form physically and mentally, never tiring and seemed ready to meet the challenges of touring. He is on top of his game, commanding the stage in a bossy yet endearing manner; he knows his songs inside and out and wants nothing less than perfection and his dancers and crew happily comply. Ortega is in control in his own right, but certainly never forgets who is the real boss. He is humble and respectful, but knows what he's doing and is Michael's excellent right hand man. He genuinely likes Michael and wants these to be the shows of shows. Over the top is not in his vocabulary.     As a reviewer noted, this was a prime opportunity to mess things up and mess up his legacy. If you are thinking 'how is that possible?' It's possible. It's all in the footage and editing and they did an excellent job. I know there are conspiracies that the footage chosen just masks many days of a frail, feeble Michael who would struggle through 10 shows, let alone 50. I believe Michael had bad days, but overall, OVERALL Michael was ready. \\"This Is It\\" is a sure testament that Michael was excited to be doing what he not only loved, but was born to do: Entertain. He owned the stage and it was home. There was an almost angelic glow around him when he was in his element; Michael practically had his own brand of musical hearing. I believed he could hear notes, key changes and beats that no one else did. The slightest chord off kilter would set him on fire. Remarkable and amazing to watch. When he said \\"Let it sizzle\\" you actually knew what he meant, it made his musicians better musicians.     We're told this footage was for his own personal library, and some people think Michael would not want us to see him being anything less than perfect--the thing is, even in practice he was, oddly, perfect. I think it was hard for him to do anything--musically anyway--so bad he wouldn't want us to see. He hit the melodies of Human Nature so perfectly you wondered if the record was playing.     The stage shows would have blown people away, from the Thriller 3D and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" video immersion alone, before we even got to the million man march of \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" and the ever remarkable \\"Billie Jean\\" number. Michael was not lying when he said he would get \\"nourished\\" from his audience. When the audience saw this concert live he would have absorbed so much love he might have imploded.     Speaking of Love, it is also a running theme. Michael loves everyone it seems, and is not afraid to say it. He scolds and corrects with L.O.V.E. and it is great. He is fun and funny, jokes and flirts and is always polite and sweet. Talk about a dream boss! Michael is the ultimate performer and a beautiful person inside and out.     Michael's loss to the world and music world still stings and it is sad that his tireless dancers and crew did not get to make history, but to grace the stage with the master has to mean something. Michael Jackson fans will drool over this movie--which steers clear of anything negative. We're here for his music legacy and we get it. Ortega gets a pat on the back. You can not watch just once, I hope the DVD gives more songs in their entirety. Excellent and a must see in theaters.    I still cannot believe he is gone. I lived in my own reality that he could never die. It is quite depressing that these are his last moments, but I am happy to have them. I am grateful that instead of remembering rumors of the propofol overdose and the rush to the hospital and the memorial as my last images, I have Michael being joyful and funny doing what he loved to do. It gives slight closure to the most remarkable, fascinating, ingenious, humble person who ever graced this earth. We will never get another one. His Legacy will never die.    I will love him forever.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Amazing footage--the closest a true fan could come to such an amazing performer! I can not wait to buy this movie & I for one, am glad to say that I have no problem with my dollars going to the children left behind from this tragedy.
B00006DEF9|5.0|That film is one of these classics we all know about but we most of us have never seen, in full or in parts. And that was my case. That film of 1952 looks back at the great shift in the cinema from silent movies to talkies and the drama it may have represented for some artists who could not adapt. This film adds to that some nasty aspects of that change, of silent films (and that has not really changed), how everything is artificial and nothing but a glossy appearance. Those actors and actresses love one another in so bizarre ways at times, and they have to cope with producers and directors. But the film is funny because so many elements are shown as ironical, humorous or just plain hilarious, not to mention some cruelty here and there. Then the plot is sentimental and even romantic with a complete rift between a fake mediatic love affair and another secret and deep love that is no affair at all but a passion. The film amplifies that rift by giving to the mediatic mistress the voice of a goat and her impossibility or rather unwillingness to train herself into some kind of drinkable vocal sound, drinkable for the audience. So the studio invents dubbing and the actress is dumb enough to want to speak to her audience who liked the voice on the screen so much. The shock is so hard that they require a song and then the dubbing has to be revealed and that is the end of a career that gets silent and mute because it should have stayed silent and mute, but vanity requires adulation and worship and then a voice has to be put on the nice face and it is the discovery of the lie, of the illusion and the public never takes it with a grain of salt when they discover they have been fooled. That film is famous for one song though it is a singing and dancing treat from beginning to end, an allusion to the career of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and some others, but with a touch of realism in the behavior of these Hollywood people. And that touch is the best fun of the film: vanity has no limits and vainer than I you die. A real treat of entertainment and an important page in the huge history book of the cinema.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDhas no limits and vainer than I you die.

0061711292|4.0|Tragic, because the more the main character Sandy tries to avoid her fate, the more she creates it for herself. Comic, because the writer's matter-of-fact style highlights some of life's simple ironies.    The title character of this book is Miss Jean Brodie, teacher at a private girls' school. Miss Brodie is \\"larger than life,\\" or so she presents herself. Though in the view of the author, Miss Brodie is very much a product of her time, Miss Brodie sees herself as transcendent. Miss Brodie's evolving, imaginative narrative of her own life is the main topic that her students study. Her narrative dominates her vision, and often she cannot see interpersonal or political events as they really are. We see Miss Brodie through the eyes of Sandy, one of her favourite students. Sandy, too, spins imaginative narratives in which she is the hero, using raw material from books, stories, and Miss Brodie's life. When Sandy reaches maturity, she finds she must distance herself from the mentor she too closely resembles. And yet, the more Sandy imagines she has rejected Miss Brodie, the more Sandy's life parallels Miss Brodie's life.    Philosophically, the book is a meditation on predestination. Spark mentions, almost in passing, the Calvinistic view that how you  live your life has no bearing on the eternal future God chooses for you. She regularly interrupts the narrative with a glimpse of the future of one of the characters. Often there seems to be no connection between the little girls we are getting to know and the adult women they become. This in itself is a parody of the randomness of the theory of predestination. But the real irony of the theory is played out in Sandy's life. On the one hand, Sandy's dreamy, self-absorbed personality seems a carbon copy of Miss Brodie's. On the other hand, Sandy finds Miss Brodie ridiculous. Sandy tries hard to make choices that reject Miss Brodie's influence. But they all backfire, and the themes that drive Sandy's life - vicarious love andconfused renunciation - parallel Miss Brodie's anyway.    Sparks writes in a deceptively simple style. She tosses us into the middle of a scene, and describes small awkward moments that capture big themes. The awkward moments make all of the characters look slightly ridiculous. Because we recognize the moments, we take a second look at  our own ordinariness, and the deceptive games hidden within it. As the book opens up our perception, we might laugh at ourselves or pity others we know. We're led to ask whether we can really escape some of life's ironies, or whether we are...predestined.

0765350386|4.0|After reading 'Elantris', I had no doubt that Brandon Sanderson could come up with good ideas, and generally write about them effectively.  I had some major issues with one or two elements of his initial effort though, which led to me giving it just an average review (3 stars - really 2 1/2 in my mind).  I'd been intrigued by Mistborn, but wondered if it would suffer from some of the same issues (both books are rated the same on Amazon).  However, it sounded like it was a novel that I would enjoy more, so I finally picked it up.  Immediately on finishing it, I went out and grabbed the final two books in the series and started reading the second.  Fairly obviously I like these books much more than I do Elantris.  Why?    For one, the characterization is better.  These characters, particularly the lead female character, feel much more like 'real' people from the kind of era that is being depicted.  In Elantris, the lead female character felt like a first world 21st century woman suddenly dropped into a Middle Ages world.  Vin, on the other hand, in Mistborn works much better in my mind.  Additionally, noblewomen seem to be portrayed more realistically.    Sanderson does still tend to repeat character 'tics' (one character is shown 'smiling' pretty much in every other sentence for quite awhile), and tends to beat the reader over the head with \\"this is important\\" exposition (one character thinks about betrayal almost constantly).  However, even though I often rolled my eyes and said 'Yeah, yeah.. I got it already...', I didn't find it a huge annoyance like I did in Elantris.    Another reason I really liked this book was because the magic systems are unique and well thought out.  I won't say much here to spoil the surprise of how they work, but suffice to say they're far more interesting than in many fantasy novels.    Sanderson also writes excellent action sequences.      He also did something that I'm not sure I've ever seen done before, effectively writing a 'parallel' story in brief paragraphs at the start of each chapter.  Again, I won't spoil the specifics, but when you discover who the other story is about, you'll almost find it more interesting than the main storyline.  At the same time, this did lead to another issue I had which prevented me from giving the novel a full 5 stars... I think that the author got just a bit too cute with a twist near the end, whereas I think the one that I had thought I'd figured out was actually more interesting than what happened.  This might be personal subjectivity, but in this case it distracted me from the story a bit more than I would have wanted.  On the other hand, there are enough clues for the reader to put it together themselves perhaps, but it still felt a bit too much like he was trying too hard.    There's also one fairly large 'huh?' moment near the end regarding an 'Inquisitor' (one of the main antagonistic groups on the novel) acting very unexpectedly that didn't feel very well explained.    One very nice element of this book is that while there are some loose threads that obviously will be resolved in the later novels, it also wraps up quite cleanly.  Overall, I highly recommend this novel in spite of some mild reservations I had about the execution.  A much better effort than Elantris, in my mind.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|The Casablanca Ultimate Collector's Edition is something that anyone who enjoys classic cinema must have as a part of their collection. The quality of the Blu-ray DVD is outstanding, but it is the other parts of the collection that truly make this package an outstanding value. I am so glad that I made it a part of my collection.
031606792X|4.0|I don't get why some people are saying the things they say, cause I loved the book. I cried when Jake left and I cried when he came to the wedding. I know how Bells feels when it comes to the whole wedding stuff. I'm 19 and just got married and I didn't have much say in my planning. I didn't get to pick my dress out, it was given to me! As for the honeymoon we didn't have a lot of cash so we didn't do much....but hey trust me we made the best of it. Bella has been through a lot the Edward is it so bad that what she wants she gets, yeah it hurt her but she wanted it. And to me this book just shows you that you may not want kids, you may be willing to give up everything for someone, but when something as great as a baby happens your way of thinking changes. Nessie was a gift, I loved her she and Bella are my favorites, of and Alice too. And I loved how the vampire families came together to save Nessie and the Cullens. And Jacob chose to love and be with Nessie, the fact that I read that someone called him a pet to her makes me sick. If people really cared then they would know that in legend it was said that after so long of drinking human blood vampires were able to go out in the sun and have kids. Yeah it would take years and years, but it's said that it could happen. I could see how being frozen at 17 would mean that Edward could you know...do the deed and have a baby.   Now I don't think a little kid should read this book, but if they are 14 or over then I say go for it, give it a shot!!
B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles' 1964 album 'Beatles for Sale' often is thrown into the dust and often overlooked. And unfairly so, in my opinion. To me, 'BFS' is a better record than both 'Please Please Me' and 'With the Beatles' (although both are great records, don't get me wrong). Released in 1964 on the Parlophone label, the record spawned a #1 hit for the group, 'Eight Days a Week,' considered a classic in their catalogue.    But, there is FAR more to this album than 'Eight Days A Week.' FAR more.     'No Reply' is a great song to listen to if you are down, and 'Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey Hey' just gets you feeling good. These are just examples of the mood changes throughout on 'Beatles for Sale.' At some moments, it's happy and cheerful, much like the prior two records were and 'A Hard Days Night.' Other times, it's gloomy and depressed, and signals the direction (and musical maturity) the boys were heading in.    'Mr. Moonlight' is one of the more underrated songs in the Beatles' catalogue. People often call it one of the worst in their catalogue. They don't know what they're missing. This is a perfectly great song, and it shows Lennon at his gloomiest (by his songwriting).    Another example of Lennon at his gloomiest is 'I'm a Loser.' Perhaps the first genuinely sad song in the Beatles' catalogue (and certainly not the last), The Beatles prove here they weren't just another happy beat group from England.     And the cover photo is just phenomenal. It captures The Beatles at their early best; one look and one can tell it is a genuine photo. The cover is one of the many highlights on 1964's 'Beatles for Sale.'    Overall, don't pass by 'Beatles for Sale.' Sure, it's no 'Rubber Soul' or 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' for that matter, but it's not a terrible album by any means. In fact, it's a classic Beatles album and one of the best albums of 1964 by a long shot.     I highly, highly recommend 'Beatles for Sale' to any Beatles fan, casual or die-hard. Don't pass this oneby. The music here is truly exceptional. Five stars is certainly earned.     ENJOY!!!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|it is with out a shadow of a dobut one of the best albums i've ever heard, even though the cd was 15 dollars at fye, it was still worth it, it is the second album that i brought that i said \\"i wish there was more songs on it (collision course by jay-z and linkin park was the first) buy it, buy it, buy it (namley from amazon if you want it cheap)
B00000DQSZ|4.0|Not many people are into progressive music/electronica like this. Too bad for them. Simply close your eyes and let this take you for ride. The music is seriously different but soothing and if you let your mind flow with it you will be surprised at the journey they take you on. This is definitely for the open minded.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I have been a big fan of Michael Buble for years. I did not know what to expect with this cd but was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the old standards but also thought the new songs were well done.    The duet with Ronald Sexsmith is probably my favorite tune on this compilation. The harmony is outstanding.His voice and music are so relaxing and calming in this fast paced world.    This cd is a great addition whether you are a new fan or old diehard lover of Michael's music.
141041986X|4.0|This book had the potential to be a five star book, and it would have been, except for the unnecesary gore presented in it.  It is true that some of the deaths were necessary to the plot of the book, but a few were not, and in quite a few cases the deaths were potrayed quite nastily when it was not necessary.    Apart from that, this book is really quite wonderfull.  The plot is engaging, the fight scenes incredible, and the psychological fight against the government is riveting.  There is also a touch of romance, which is not too overdone and contributes well to the book as a whole.  I definetly reccomend this book.
B0012IWHDW|5.0|Bob Dylan's soundtrack for Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid might be one of his most underrated works. Recorded in California in early 1973, this is a most unique experience in his career. First of all, most songs are instrumentals. And no, they don't need any lyrics. There's a soothing atmosphere to them and it feels as if Dylan allows us right into his place by the woods where a fire crackles beside running streams under the light of a magical moon and acoustic guitars, flutes, bongos, tambourine, fiddle, banjo, voices, harmonium, cellos, bass intertwine in harmony...<br /><br />And then there is Dylan singing passionately - his voice different once again. Neither does he sound like he did on his previous album New Morning two and a half years before nor Planet Waves which was recorded with The Band a few months after in November 1973. Yet another side of the master! The original, haunting version of Knockin' On Heaven's Door is pure classic and belongs 100% among the other songs. Billy 1, 4 & 7 are great variations on the same theme with Dylan's voice sounding strong and melodically different in each one! Such joy.<br /><br />With that in mind, this music should be taken as a whole.<br /><br />There's nothing like this in Dylan's recorded output so the fact that Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid is a one-off musical adventure makes it all even more worthwhile! I'll be eagerly awaiting for a proper remastered version of this sadly forgotten yet most treasured and timeless piece of music.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"This is It\\" is the final chapter to a remarkable life to a wonderfully talented and gifted man.  I wasn't too sure on what to anticipate before watching the film...    Was it going to be cheesy?  Overly Sad and Depressing?  Was it a \\"concert film\\" or \\"documentary\\"?    I went into the Premiere that Tuesday Night in Los Angeles, Ca expecting to be sad.  To shed some tears and remember what a tragedy his death was.  TO my suprise I didn't cry much at all.   On the contrary...     I SMILED! :)  He looked amazingly upbeat, STRONG, smart, and oh so smooth!    I Laughed! :D  His humor and manner of speaking he used with his staff and co-workers gave me some insite as to who this reclusive man \\"really\\" was.  Not the harsh picture that media has published for years but of a kind, funny, and loving man!    I DANCED! (In my seat ofcourse) haha  The music and his voice were tremendously vibrant and haunting.  His new variations on old classics like \\"The Way you Make me Feel\\" and \\"Human Nature\\" truely touches you!     I was in \\"Awe\\" of his musical genius!  His perfectionism is displayed in this film.  Not in a snobbish or snotty fashion but in a wise and as a \\"True Master of his Craft\\" kinda WAY!    Yes, Michael did look a bit thin BUT when was he ever BIG??? He's always been a slinder man with a dancers body!  One thing I can tell you is this film definetely shows Mj in his area of expertise...DANCE!    The Dancers half his age or younger marveled in his shadow as the King of POP took to the stage in marvelous dance sequences.    In all this film is a great relief to grief stricken MJ FANS and a re-birth of Michael's image to those who never recognized his talent before.  Or failed to accept it! (Due to lackluster media lies) :(     I've been a fan since a little girl of 7 and will continue to be.  You do NOT have to be a fan of Michael Jackson's to appreciate this film.  You simply should be a person who appreciates the man's hard work, artistic expression,dedication and L.O.V.E for ones passion!     Go see it! It's great <3  Movie Tip:  Stay till the very end of the film.  After the credits and all...You won't regret it! ;)
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|It's an ok film, nothing really amazing that I would like in film, if you have nothing better to do, watch it.
B001RT89TC|5.0|Every since Michael Schenker went out on his own and formed MSG after leaving UFO and the small stint back in the Scorpions for Lovedrive,the Man just pours the greatness of his playing into all of his music and he is always coming up with some of the greatest riffs and solos on a consistent basis.    While this album may have Graham Bonnet on vocals and not Gary Barden,I think Graham does a great job on the songs.Some don't like his vocals and I can agree with that with some of the bands he has worked with.This album is one of those where I think his vocals work excellent with the songs.    From the opening tune of Assualt Attack through the extra added B-Side track of Girl From Uptown the album just flows from tune to tune.Then you also get another classic Instrumental from Michael titled Ulcer.     Michael has been and always will be one of the greatest guitar players out there,period.
B002HNA95E|4.0|Let me just start by saying I was a fan from the beginning. My sister brought home Madonna's first album when I was 5 years old and it soon disappeared into my tape player, never to return. Since then I've always loved her old standards, but soon grew tired of buying every cd expecting to love every song. Officially, the last album I fell in love with was Ray Of Light. I couldn't get over how GOOD it sounded. How different. But you know Madonna...she is a chameleon. Just when you think you know her sound, it changes.     When this compilation came out I must've changed my mind about buying it three times. I finally gave in, brought it home tonight and slapped it onto my itunes. I was rather disappointed to find several favorites missing and NO LYRICS! Not that we really need them, but come on! And I don't really need a locker poster. I'm not in school anymore people.     It took FOREVER to download it onto my itunes, but when I plugged in my Skullcandy earphones and pushed play...well the first song \\"Hung Up\\" rather blew me away. It was like hearing it for the first time at the club. Every bit of the music is incredible! I'm SO excited to go back in time with these songs and sorry I stayed away so long. Just wish we would have got more bang for our hard earned bucks that us \\"FANS\\" have thrown towards the media and Madonna all these years.    You've never sounded better, girl. Keep on running. We're not far behind...
B000IMM3XW|5.0|Who wants to watch a movie that reminds you of your everyday life and the struggles we all face? Anyone? ... I didn't think so. This is just what the doctor ordered. Get away from reality with this great action flick with good special effects. I can watch this one over, and over, and over ...
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time films.  About 10 years ago I decided to watch all films of the AFI 100 years 100 movies. That was the only reason I grabbed this off of the shelf.  This movie is one of the rare films that gets better every single time you watch it.  The dialogue is crisp and fantastic.  I have a digital copy on my Zune and have LISTENED to this film a dozen times while on road trips.  I just slap on my headphones and listen, laugh and quote dialogue to myself.  My wife thinks I am crazy.<br /><br />This is the story of one maniacal Air Force general who authorizes his planes to nuke the Soviet Union. After he gives the go code, and refuses to call them back, the rest of the film follows 3 groups of people, the general and his RAF counterpart holed up in the office on the base.  The army is trying to get to the general to get the recall code.  The RAF commander is trying to get the insane general to give in. We also have the B52 bomber flown by Major Kong on its way to deliver the payload (Kong is the one from the iconic image of the pilot riding the nuke as it plummets) and my favorite arena, the Pentagon.  At the pentagon we have the President and his closest advisers, including Buck Turgidson and the titular Dr Strangelove. George C Scott as Turgidson is phenomenal.  His facial expressions, mannerisms, and overall insanity play perfectly in this nuclear satire.  While Strangelove is the ex nazi scientist who is helping America to win the cold war.<br /><br />There are so many fantastic parts, lines, innuendos, and visuals in this film, it would take too long to mention them all.  Just please, watch the film.<br /><br />On the DVD you can see inside the mind of the 1960's Hollywood marketing team.  The Trailer is awkward at best.  What was nice was the \\"interviews\\".  IN the 60's they used to tape answers to questions from the cast for a split screen interview. Then they would have their local entertainment reporter \\"ask\\" the questions and it woudl look like Peter Sellers was talking to your hometown guy.<br />Tellers was talking to your hometown guy.

B002MBAJ4M|4.0|Well, I've had this one in the player pretty much non-stop since I got it. I am the type of listener who needs to layer-on impressions through repeated listening so i can get a bead on things. This is a fine effort from the boys.   Gov't Mule retains their live-studio sound on 'By a Thread' as they animate songs via various styles while still putting their venerable stamp on the proceedings.  My three-year old girl is already \\"singing along\\" to 'Railroad Boy.' (Then yelling at me to 'turn it down, Daddy!!' as I push it towards maximum warp!).  Reviewers who say they can't hear the rock on this record may need to repeat a year with Jack Black at the School of Rock. Check out the frenzied, near-manic build-up throughout 'Railroad Boy,' or the vintage-modern 'Inside Outside Woman Blues,' or the outro of the tastefully reggae-tinged 'Steppin' Lightly.'  'Any Open Window' is a nice, catchy rock song that is lyrically compassionate and continues to speak to those who find affinity with the output of Warren Haynes.  (May I just say here that Warren Haynes is a mighty brave musician and that the contemporary music scene is blessed to have him (and his mates) around.)  On balance, this cd is high-energy stuff, played and sung extremely well by supremely talented musicians functioning oh-so-well as a cohesive unit.  I can't wait to see the Mule in London in a few weeks, as I'm an expatriated Yank who can be found clinging on to his roots via the grace of Gov't Mule.  Cheers, fellas!!
B001QOGYFE|2.0|If you like beautiful Kate Beckinsale, you may like her latest effort \\"Whiteout.\\" But if you are looking for a great thriller (whatever your definition of \\"great\\" is), sorry, you don't find one here. I thought the film's premise about a dead body in Antarctica was promising and would offer at least something original. No, whoever wrote the screenplay (four writers are credited), they only came up with a plot that remains generic and below-average throughout, just like that of a badly-written straight-to-DVD thriller.    In the new Dark Castle/Warner thriller \\"Whiteout\\" Kate Beckinsale plays Carrie Stetko, a US marshal stationed at American Antarctic base. She has been here for the past two years, and the tired marshal is about to leave the outpost for good when a dead body is found at the most remote site of the continent. This could be the first-ever homicide case in Antarctica, and Carrie is immediately sent to the scene, where she and Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht), an operative from UN, discover something unusual deep in the ice.    Actually, it is nothing unusual or surprising for those who have seen the film from the beginning. Despite occasional actions and flashbacks that suggest Carries' traumatic past, \\"Whiteout\\" remains very dull. The film's cliché-ridden story moves at a snail's pace and works neither as thriller nor as drama. Columbus Short and Tom Skerritt appear as pilot and doctor respectively, but except one lengthy operation scene, they (and other supports) are just ciphers. Perhaps to say \\"ciphers\\" is not enough because during the \\"action\\" scenes, with heavy blizzard and thick overcoats, we often cannot tell who is chasing who, or simply what is going on.    Sometimes it seems the director (Dominic Sena, \\"Swordfish\\") is not really interested in the thriller he is supposed to tell. Things often happen and end abruptly. No attempt is made to build up the tension and even the Canadian location (the film was shot in Manitoba and Quebec) doesn't look attractive enough. And as to the star Kate Beckinsale, yes, she does her best, but the fact only makes me feel that her efforts surely deserve far better.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|i love paramore.  they have a great band, great lead singer, and play clean music that is fun to listen to, as well as watch live, or on tv.  i would suggest it to anyone who likes pop/rock music, my boyfriend even likes it!

0061914177|5.0|Crush It! is for anybody who has passion and is willing to hustle!  If you're like me you love reading business and leadership books like: Winning by Jack Welch, Good to Great by Jim Collins, The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John Maxwell, and anything by Ken Blanchard, Brian Tracy or Harvey Mackay.  Crush It! will soon be the \\"go to\\" book for how to market in this new age of consumer controlled media.     As a business professional, I have run multi-million dollar companies and lead billion dollar portfolios while always wondering where all the money was going. Sure, I saw the spreadsheets and knew the budget breakdowns, but it always seemed like we were spending an awful lot of money on marketing programs that were not delivering as projected.  On top of that, every time I looked around I saw people taking every day, seemingly random ideas and succeeding in big ways by simply using the power of the internet and social media.  I wanted in.     And now I'm pissed that Crush It! wasn't around a year ago...it would have made my life much easier.      Crush It! serves as an inspirational, educational, and instructional outline on how to monetize your passion.  And, after reading Crush It!, it's not hard to figure out what Gary Vee is passionate about - connecting people to their passions through the true benefits of the internet. Sure, he loves wine, the Jets and is a visionary thinker when it comes to the new age of marketing, but Gary's true love is people. I've seen Gary speak multiple times in person and on TV and his enthusiasm for helping people succeed is contagious. However, what's truly impressive is Gary's genuine belief in the \\"thank you economy.\\"  In Crush It! he outlines that the foundation of his success was not in charging for his thoughts but rather in giving them away through social media and the exponential growth power of the internet.     Gary's process is pretty straight forward:    1. Family First.  (or none of it will matter)  2. Work hard.  (it's not about overnight success)  3. Have passion.     While I think giving up your day job and following your passion is a personal decision and one that takes much consideration, Crush It! could be that one little push you need to redefine your path.  In it Gary points you to valuable tools that will help you share your passion with the world while always keeping it real by reminding us that not everyone is going to be \\"huge\\" like \\"Oprah\\" but the fact that the game is changing and that the opportunity is there is exciting enough to at least try.  He'll give you actionable and simple steps and then leave it up to you to put in the effort needed to effectively execute.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life Is Beautiful, La vita è bella (1997), Directed by Roberto Benigni. Starring Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, and Giorgio Cantarini.     This is the best movie ever made.  It pulls on your heart more than any other movie because the characters and situations will make you smile and laugh from romance and comedy, frown in anger from fear, and then cry from a pride which will leave the viewer in a greater appreciation for life, and love, with special attention to the relationship between a loving father and his son and wife.

B002UD56HW|5.0|Michael Jackson is an icon and his music and presence will reign forever!  The movie is a testament of his talent, creativity and passion for all his fans.  He is phenomenal and he will be truly missed.
B001M2604U|4.0|Gene Hackman shines in this 104 minute groundbreaking, exciting film released in 1971.  Forever known as Popeye Doyle, his signature role, Mr. Hackman is retired as an actor (his last role was in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004 opposite Ray Romano), but has been an accomplished author for a number of years.  The action scenes in this film are amazing, especially that famous car chase under that train trestle in New York.<br /><br />Popeye Doyle is a Narcotic Cop after drug dealers headed up by an elusive Frenchman and his brutal sidekick.  Hackman is helped along in his chase by Roy Scheider, who plays his detective partner.  Great chemistry between the two, a lot of sardonic wit from Hackman.  While Scheider's character is underplayed, he does a great job, going on to superstardom in Jaws a few years later.<br /><br />This is Hackman's vehicle, however, and his Popeye Doyle is as relentless as The Terminator in his pursuit of the villains.  Hackman, whose acting teachers epic failed by telling him that he would never amount to anything, are probably turning in their graves now, as he has indeed retired as one of the best film actors in the history of the profession.  For this reason, I probably would watch him reading the phone book and still be impressed.<br /><br />The movie's climax is somewhat unsatisfying, and even the score seems to reflect this.  Perhaps it's the director's way of saying, \\"this is what's going on and maybe we need to be doing something about it in real life!\\"<br /><br />The sound mix, given thunder by the Dolby 5.1 treatment on this 2-disc DVD set, is outstanding, especially in how things move about in the stereo field.  I definitely plan on getting French Connection II.<br /><br />By the way, I bought this from an Amazon vendor who only charged a penny for this set and it was in Near Mint condition!  What a gem!  Here's another Amazon [[ASIN:B00003CXA3 The French Connection (Five Star Collection)]] product link in case this one is unavailable.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just got home from seeing This is it. The shows were going to be the best shows Michael ever did and thankfully his fans will get to see the king in action one last time. Very rarely will I sit thru a movie and not move, but I tonite I couldnt take my eyes off the screen at all. If you are a Michael fan at all, you HAVE to see this movie. RIP Michael, you are forever the king of pop!

0205632645|5.0|Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" is an excellent primer and companion for anyone who writes or enjoys writing, whether you are an occasional letter writer or a serious blogger. The rules contained therein are intended to teach one to be a clear and concise writer, first and foremost. But the book also acknowledges that style is a personal matter, something that evolves out of the individual who is otherwise following their advice. The book is a quick read, is not without humor, and has become a part of my thinking every time I sit down to write. The abbreviated email-ese that passes for English is not sufficient for a business letter or any kind of importance correspondence. If you want or need to be a proficient, readable writer, \\"The Elements of Style\\" is a very good place to start.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|The collection of songs here are a step back in time to the glory days of both entertainers & neither has lost his touch. Winwood still sounds remarkably similar to his hey days & Clapton can still generate passion with his guitar work. Put the two of them together & it only gets better.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Yes, you read it right in the subject line...I am a regular 28 year old guy who lifts weights, plays video games from time to time, etc. That being said I could not stop crying through this movie. My girlfriend and I watched it together and it just makes you well up with emotion over and over again. It brings to light some poignant truths: that life is short, not to be pedantic (don't let the little things get to you), Love and cherish the people who are special to you. I never particularly cared for Hillary Swank before this (I think it all started when she played \\"the next karate kid\\" lol) but now I really like her as an actress. It's such a beautiful movie with a beautiful love story that ended too soon, but such is life...rarely ever fair. \\"Carpe Diem and remember the important things because they may be gone before you know it\\" once again are the messages this movie sends. I highly recommend it to anyone.

It seems the world is in a serious hunger for c...p.<br />Infantile ideas...but that would actually cause injustice to kids' stories. Presumptuous. Pompous.<br />But... in an extremely simple language written for 3-4 years old. Allegedly metaphorically spoken. Supposedly explaining to us (the idiots who have purchased the book) the greater powers of the universe...God, the sun, the wind, the desert and a boy that masters them all... duh...<br /><br />NOT reading it - would actually guarantee you'll have a better understanding of the universe, life, love and ... everything in between.<br />A TOTAL waste of time. Pure BS coated with sugary metaphysics. I would use hasher words but Amazon would not publish them.

B00005NGAK|5.0|I got Lord of the Dance on video more than 10 years ago. I've seen/listened to it so many times I'm surprised my DVD isn't worn out. I liked the music so much that I bought the Lord of the Dance on audio CD so I could have a \\"clean\\" copy of the music by itself.    I've known about Feet of Flames for many, many years but for some reason I never \\"bothered\\" with it. I recently saw some video clips of Feet of Flames on youtube and was surprised that the music was the same music from Lord of the Dance. I just assumed Feet of Flames would have all new music. (Because Riverdance was very different from Lord of the Dance.)    Without hesitation, I ordered Feet of Flames on DVD. By now, I've watched/listened to it several times and have watched the additional materials as well.    If you liked Lord of the Dance, (especially if you liked it for the music), then you absolutely want to add this to your collection.    Feet of Flames is amazing! It's quite a bit longer than Lord of the Dance, but all the additional time is a welcomed change from Lord of the Dance because it adds so much new content that you will not have seen before.    The video production quality is top notch as is the audio. The stage is much bigger than Lord of the Dance which affords more opportunity to put more dancers on stage at the same time. Both horizontally AND vertically! Yes - the stage in Feet of Flames has multiple vertical levels.    The costumes are rich and vibrant, the women are sleek and gorgeous, the music is hypnotic, and of course, the dancing is mesmerizing to behold!    The hour-long documentary that shows the preparation for the Feet of Flames recording is a fantastic bonus. You get to go behind the stage and watch them practice the dancing, watch the road crew set up the stage, and get all kinds of insight from Michael Flatley about his career. If you like this stuff even a little, you will love the bonus materials.    My only complaint is that I didn't buy this YEARS ago!
0517548232|5.0|This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Wow.  That really is all I can say at this point.  The music they have compiled together on this CD is a wonderful, inspiring message to us all.  It's amazing to hear all of the different sounds from around the world put together in such a beautiful way.  Music really is the one universal language, something every person on this planet has in common.  If you listen to music - in any form or fashion - this is a must-buy.  You will be moved by the sheer power in the music.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|As always, meticulously researched and loaded with fascinating historical facts and theories regarding their significance.  But dwells too long on the author's social message to the detriment of the story.
B000002LAC|5.0|This is a great album that I had not listened to in a while.  The three voices are each beautiful in their own right and put together are just lovely.  The arrangements are wonderful, especially on \\"Memories\\".  Dolly Parton shines, which is saying a lot considering the other two are such superstars.  Really special.
6305558167|4.0|There have been good Arthurian movies and miniseries; Tristan and Isolde, Lancelot du Lak (Bresson), Percival (Romar), Mists of Avalon, and a few others.<br /><br />There have been very bad Arthurian movies/miniseries; Merlin and the Sword (1982), Merlin (Sam Neil), The Last Legion, and several others.<br /><br />There are Arthurian movies that are somewhere inbetween; First Knight, Sword of Lancelot, King Arthur, and others.<br /><br />Excalibur is by far one of the best, if not THE best Arthurian movie ever made. a true arthurian classic.<br /><br />it attempts the retell King Arthur's life story from his birth until his death.<br />and it does it quit well.<br /><br />now I admit the script may not be great and this movie may not be top notch but its by far one of the superior King Arthur movies Ive ever seen.<br /><br />one of the best things for sure is the actors.<br />Nigel Terry as the brave King Arthur. Helen Mirren excelles as the villeness Morgana (Morgan le fay). Gabriel Bryne makes a good King Uther.<br /><br />however it is Nicol Williamson that steals every scean with his performance as Merlin. displaying every aspect that there is to the wizard. the prophet, the lover, the trickster, and so on.<br /><br />the movie also contains many elements from the orgnal legends. the sword in the stone, the wounded king, the grail quest, and others.<br /><br />it also has the underlining element of the land and the king are one.<br />something borrowed from Jessie Weston's From Ritual to Romance.<br />now its true this movie is not an exact retelling. but it has all the elements of the orginal legends.<br /><br />I have to admit it was this movie that helped get me interested in arthurian legends.<br /><br />the movie begins with Uther who is at war with Gorlois. Uther wants to be king, but Merlin wants peace. Merlin gives the sword Excalibur to Uther to use.<br />Uther however lusts after the wife of Gorlois, Igraine.<br />he wants Merlin to help him claim her.<br />this brings about the boy Arthur.<br /><br />Merlin takes Arthur away, while Uther is killed by his enemies and places Excalibur into a stone.<br />years later young Arthur is living with Sir Ector and his son Sir Kay.<br />the boy is not aware of his true greatness.<br />not until he is the only one able to pull the sword from the stone.<br />the other kings do not acept him so Arthur is forced to do battle with them.<br /><br />for many years Arthur has many battles until meeting with Sir Lancelot. both fight as enemies but become friends. Excalibur is broken but reforged.<br /><br />more time passes as Arthur and his knights expell all the enemis of the land.<br />it is then that Arthur takes Gunievere for his wife, but she is fated to love Lancelot.<br /><br />Lancelot defends the queen's honor in a dule, but is wounded. the knight and the queen become lovers which threatens to tare the kingdom apart.<br />Arthur is enraged by this.<br /><br />it is at this moment Morgana plays her hand, she traps Merlin and concives a son by sleeping with Arthur. she bares Mordred, the king's bane.<br /><br />Arthur is wounded by God for his sins.<br />the quest for the Grail then begins.<br />all the while Mordred grows and becomes enbittered towards the king.<br /><br />its is only Percival that is able to find the Grail and heal the king.<br />it is a glorious moment when the king is healed and the land becomes alive again.<br /><br />however Arthur must now go out and do battel with Mordred, which proves his downfall.<br /><br />in the end he is taken away to the isle of Avalon to be healed.<br /><br />The movie does a great job in telling this story, again it may not be top notch but it does a decent job.<br /><br />the movie also is aided with snachs from Wagner. bits from Tristan and Isold, Percevial, and Twilight of the Gods. O Fortunata is used quit often in this movie as well.<br /><br />all in all this is probly one of the best of the Arthurian movies.<br />a true classic.
0786868724|5.0|I was very pleased with this book.  I am a fan of Mitch Albom anyways.  And he didn't let me down with this book.  I finished it in 1 day.  It was received in excellent condition and on time.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books.  This one was predictable from the start.  When there were intense moments, Dan Brown killed them by explaining it all away.  I was frustrated reading it, and very disappointed.
B00003CWL6|2.0|I may have missed the point of the movie.  It seemed to be a  hopeless movie, i.e. no hope for anyone, almost depressing.  I guess you have to be in the mood to see it.  If you want to see a family disintegrate, then watch it.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I remember when this movie first came out, the critics panned it for having \\"unrealistic\\" scenes of crew interaction while the Memphis Belle was on its last mission.  As a former aircraft commander of a bomber crew, I can tell you that the crew interaction and banter between the crew members is the most realistic part of the movie! I highly recommend this movie not only as an example of what our young men sacrificed for our country at that time,  but also a terrific story - even though it is not the real story of the Belle's last mission.
B002TC9TEA|4.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites, but the new blue-ray version really adds an extra \\"Wow\\" factor. The color and clarity are enhanced for added sharpness and enjoyment. We had recieved this dvd as a gift, so I wasn't as aware of the price until I checked it out here on Amazon.     Although, I really love the movie, I'm not sure that it is worth the extra money. Perhaps the economy has made me more budget conscious, but I would probably think twice about this unless you were absolutely determined to get THIS movie. In that case, you will not be disappointed. If you are trying to decide between Snow White and another movie at a lower cost, think hard.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I enjoyed seeing Michael Jackson dance and sing.  And what a bonus to see his musical/creative genuis as he worked with the musicians and performers.  I highly recommend this movie.  It would be hard for anybody to deny that he was an incredible performer and artist.
B002NACY2M|4.0|I agree with the previous two reviews.  If you liked Sting's Songs of the Labrinythe, you will like this.  I never really liked Sting until Songs of the Lab. and this cements it.  It's not traditional Christmas music, should be listened to (as opposed to multitasking and listening).  I too was disappointed until I sat a listened.    If you like Winter theme music, check out Kenny Loggins December CD.  The style is not like Sting's, but it is a great Winter (and Christmas CD)!
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old daughter cringing the whole time wondering how many times I'd be forced to watch what I expected to be an extended version of the Hannah Montana television show.  To my surprise, it was a very nice movie.  As it turns out, Miley Cyrus is a pretty good actress.  She is much better than what you see on the television show.  The whole style of acting is much more mature but still quirky and cute.  The movie was sweet, funny, had great music, and had a very nice story line about a girl getting back in touch with her roots.  I would recommend this movie for kids and adults.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I am extremely pleased with my order/movie. I received it before the expected date and the movie was in wonderful condition. No scratches, no skips or pauses while viewing. Family is delighted.
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the theater and was thrilled each time. I couldn't wait for this movie to come out on DVD! The action scenes are really good, and the actor that plays Sabretooth was perfect! I don't think that there will be much disappointment in this movie if you watch it for what it is and not try to compare it too precisely to the comic book series.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I received my Mono Box Set 1 week ago.  I've now had the time to review the product, from packaging to the music on the discs.    The packaging is very well done, even better than the Stereo Box set (I had a problem with glue on most of the CDs enclosed in the Stereo Box Set).  The album cover reproductions are very well done, especially for Please Please Me, Beatles For Sale, Help, Sgt. Pepper, and the White Album (including all inserts).  The back cover for Revolver (and some of the others not mentioned) could have been done better, because the large white flaps from the front cover overpower the back cover image somewhat.    The remastering on the discs is excellent.  The mono discs sound as close to the original mono vinyl albums as I can tell.  I do not detect any equalization at all on the mono discs (as compared to the louder volume, louder vocals, and louder bass/drums on the stereo discs).  I did notice that certain clicks, noises, etc., have been removed on the mono discs, too, so it's not just a straight mastering of the original master tapes.    I have listened to the mono discs several times now.  Kudos to the Beatles for allowing us to own the remastered mono mixes, and for the great job done on the entire product.  While being somewhat a little disappointed in the Stereo Box Set (4.5 stars), I rate the Mono Box Set a full 5 stars.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I can literally watch this movie over and over again!  It was definitely worth the purchase.  I loved all the added commentary and videos in the special features.

B000JLQSWE|5.0|Excellent as always.  I had to replace an old lp long gone.  I still need to get a few more.  I saw Alan Parsons Project about 10 years ago and then Alan Parsons with other artists at Summerfest in Milwaukee about 8 years ago.  He/they were great!!

B001TN1EBG|5.0|I love music, particualary the genera that William Fritzsimmons is in.  But he is by far one of the best musicians in this or any other genera.  His music calms the soul and carries a message that is pure, as it is deep.  I really cannot say much more than this album speaks to me on so many levels.  His voice is perfect, soft, and easy to listen to.  The instruments prefectly compliment the vocals.  And the two combine to create a sound that is unforgettable and simply a pleasure to hear.  All of his music is phenominal, but this CD is, in my opinion, the best!
B002M2T1UO|4.0|Where's the blu ray release? Will not buy this because of that. Loved the show but will wait...
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This movie was truly a gift and a pleasure watching.  Even though it would've been phenomenal to see live in concert, if Michael was living, but it was so filled with intimacy and L-O-V-E. Intimacy with his music and LOVE with his fans and infamous talents being discovered with him on his tour.  Regardless of the tragic death of our beloved Michael, I think that this movie was wonderfully put together since it was only made originally for Michael's personal collection. It just really showed how serious and fun it was working with michael and his love for his fans and the emotional feel for music.  He was a perfectionist in the most humble and respectful way. NOT ONCE did Michael yell at anyone that didn't get the lighting right or if they came in too soon on the music. He was indeed a hands-on type artist and he truly inspired me even more as a singer/performer in the music industry. I loved this side to Michael and everyone he choose to be apart of \\"This is it\\" Tour were sincerely greatful and appreciative to this moment and opportunity in michael's life. It is a must see BUT ONLY if you ar a TRUE MJ FAN.  If you are a TRUE MJ FAN, it doesn't matter how the production of the movie was or if it was put together nicely or if Michael didn't seem to put out alot in singing/dancing or if they didn't run a full dress rehearsal...it just doesn't MATTER!!! Any time you SEE michael share himself WITH LOVE to you whether its on the stage or off the stage in VIDEO, is a moment to embrace and love on. Another incredible HISTORIC MOMENT OF THE LIFE OF MICHAEL J. JACKSON and HIS MUSIC.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|Disk 3 would not load at all. Took it to have it cleaned and they said that wasn't the problem someone tried to copy over it. But the other disks in the set worked ok.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I received this movie to review as a member of the One2One Network.    I have seen this movie many times. But seeing it on Blu-Ray was like seeing a brand new movie. The color and clarity was amazing, even with my older TV and DVD player. The extra features were great.    Overall I would highly recommend purchasing this movie.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I have only used this video for level one.  I find the workout good and it seems like it can accommodate most any level.  It is especially good for those wanting a place to start.  One aspect of this video which I really do not like is that each time I start the video I have to go through all the \\"introductions,\\" which seem to take about five minutes.  When I come in to work out, I want to work out--I do not need to sit through the promo materials each time.  All the pressing of menu buttons, fast forward, etc., are to no avail.  Please, you need to \\"package\\" this better.
0385340990|1.0|I was having trouble sleeping last week and needed a new book.  Having read so many glowing reviews, I was surprised at WHAT a DRAG this book was.<br /><br />PLEASE someone tell me what I am missing here???  I was so bored I couldn't even finish it, which is rare for me.  At least it cured my insomnia.
0385504225|3.0|This is not Dan Brown's best work. If the only book you have read by him is the Davinci Code, then don't read this one. You will be very disappointed. Dan gets too bogged down in details of Washington DC, and the Masonic order itself, that the reader finds himself glossing over much of it. I personally didn't care what happened to the characters. The story was too formulaic in it's writing, and appeared to be written with the intent of turning it into a movie. Like what happened to the Ludlum books, Brown has become far too predictable for the reader.
B002RI9A4U|5.0|I love books about rock 'n roll.  I love the Beatles, the Stones and so many more.  Now I love Tucker Crowe.  There were so many subtle references to other rock stars (Paul Is Dead?  Faul?) that I want to blog about them, and I want to actually HEAR the music that caused such an uproar.  I want to travel to Gooleness after I tour Liverpool.  Seriously, this book was so damn enjoyable, I just hated for it to end.  But the entire read was completely entertaining -- even the \\"bridge\\" portions were well written and funny, funny, funny.  Great characters.  This one gets all my stars for a truly terrific read!
0743298039|5.0|I am an avid reader, yet I find myself frequently disappointed with the quality of writing that dominates the popular market now.  I have to say, this book is flawless.  I was mesmerized and completely drawn in not just by the characters and the plot, which are riveting on their own, but also with the beauty of Setterfield's language and her willingness to create a three-dimensional world of detail for her characters and her reader.  This is a novel for those who love literature and are not afraid of a story of depth.  To me, Setterfield has accomplished an amazing feat: she has crafted a riveting tale as absorptive as any of the most popular page-turner bestsellers with an uncompromising commitment to the art of the novel.  I stumbled across this novel in the library and had no prior knowledge beyond the book jacket. I feel as though I have inadvertently discovered a treasure of immeasurable wealth.  I finished it two days ago, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Enjoyable little bad seed thriller.  Some good acting and really tense moments make this a winner.  The twist ending - which if you are smart and pay attention you can probably figure out - is still great fun.  Enjoy!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I do so love Alice in Chains~  I like this cd although it does sound a little like Jerrys solo stuff~ however I am forever convinced that the next cd will take on a diff direction and hopefully William will fly his freak flag!
0060555661|5.0|\\"An investment is one which, upon analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Anything else is a speculation and should be avoided.\\" - Benjamin Graham<br /><br />This quote pretty much sums up Graham's macro perspective on investing. Many investors view Benjamin Graham is the father of value investing and that's not far-fetched. This work is one of the best out there on the topic of value investing (or investing with a \\"Margin of Safety.\\" It is a must read for anyone who has passion for the topic.<br /><br />Benjamin Graham has laid down a solid, entirely fundamentals-driven argument for why value is the most sound approach to making stock selection/investment decisions. Its written clearly, its concise and its sound fundamental advice makes the work timeless. Mr. Graham does an excellent job of laying out great examples to convince you that value investing and dollar cost averaging is the only right way to invest. He further details the methods to pick a company and determine its intrinsic value. The book also has a number of case studies, allowing the reader to see real world application of Mr. Grahams concepts, though some of the commentary is distracting.<br /><br />So, the principles in this book are solid, writing is clear, examples are beneficial. It is geared toward a long-term investor, but it lacks any technical analysis, which I believe can be very beneficial to determine when to get in/get out of a solid fundamental pick.<br />Its one of my top 10 value investing reads, up there with Klarman's Margin of Safety, and Joel Greenblatts's You Can Be A Stock Market Genius.
1402521154|4.0|After listening to this unabridged book, I felt each and everyone's complex pain. I felt that it was written very well and I was kept anxiously wanting and waiting for justice. I caught myself several times, saying WHAT? It did keep me on my toes, thinking that I knew what was going to happen and then it didn't. That does not happen often with me and was enjoyable. Sometimes I want a different type of read that departs from my hero writer, Ann Rule. And this fit the bill perfectly. I do not want to give away any of the story so I will just say that it was very interesting to hear the story written and narrated from a dead girls perspective. That's what I feel really made this story work. Enjoy!
B000KIHM80|4.0|I was in college when Chuck busted out with this album and it did not suprise me when he had a hit on it.

All his groups were tight!
0307389839|4.0|The plodding title of Haruki Murakami's memoir, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running telegraphs the content; Murakami treads along the pages at the measured clip of a mid-pack runner. Two quick sentences in the forward appear like staccato marks accenting a jaunty note: \\"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.\\" There it is--the plot laid bare. For the remaining pages Murakami's prose slows to a meandering pace as he runs the streets of Athens, Tokyo, and New York,  musing on the meaning of  life.    This is no ordinary running guide or how-to book; Murakami's memoir is a series of \\"life lessons\\" delivered with the same precision as he lives--\\"more like a workhorse than a racehorse.\\"  Downplaying his writing talents, Murakami attributes two qualities to his success: focus and endurance--his gouge and chisel for carving out a writer's life amid the malaise of a chaotic world.      A poster of Steve Prefontaine hangs behind the register at a local running store in town. Above the legend's photo his words embolden patrons:  \\"To give anything less than the best is to sacrifice the gift\\"   Murakami echos the running hero's sentiment: \\"Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: That's the essence of running, and a metaphor for life.\\"     On the surface Murakami's words sound like something from a Knute Rockne biopic.  Beneath his trite inspiration are strains of a more imploring message: in a long-distance run it is not enough to simply brace for pain.  You must train for its inevitable arrival--somewhere around mile twenty if memory of my one marathon experience serves me correctly--and the very act of training, of pushing your body to its limits, is where you'll find meaning.  Murakami puts it this way:    \\"It's precisely because of the pain, precisely because we want to overcome that pain, that we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being alive--or at least a partial sense of it.  Your quality of experience is based not onstandards such as time or ranking, but on finally awakening to an  awareness of the fluidity within action itself.\\"    Couch happy Murakami fans may not be inspired to lace up a pair of Nike's after reading that passage and for good reason.  Who wants to hurt? But pain and suffering are different animals, says Murakami--the former does not presuppose the latter.  In fact, it may even guard against it.    It's well-documented that the work of writers and artists requires toiling in \\"toxic\\" places, says Murakami.  They live an interior life of the mind inertly examining the banality of human existence, seeking out the truth of our being.  Marathon training gives Murakami the emotional energy for handling the strain of  the writer's task.  Time out on the road seems to strengthen his capacity for nurturing his craft.  His continued success as a novelist is perhaps proof that the effort is paying off.

B001ECE6D0|3.0|While I am a fan of Stereophonics and was glad to see the band finally get a greatest hits CD, I have to question half of the songs that made it to the list. Being not really known much here in America, I would have to assume most of these were probably chosen by the amount of airtime they received overseas. But come on, really? I have to certainly disagree with several of the choices made here. What happened to gems like \\"Hurry up and wait\\", \\"Rewind\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Nothing precious at all\\", \\"Getaway\\", \\"Pass the Buck\\" or \\"Lying in the Sun\\"? Songs like these really show the complexity of the band, and their craftiness for being able to create very catchy & intriguing melodies. While I realize that everyone has their own idea as to what should have been considered a 'hit', I just don't think this compilation is a very good representation of what this band is completely capable of. \\"Vegas two times\\" also has to be one of the most horrendous songs I have ever heard before and should never have made the label of being a 'greatest hit' (or maybe I just missed something). But, alas, this is simply my opinion, and I am still very much looking forward to their forthcoming 2009 release.

B002HNA95E|5.0|I will keep this review short. Most of you if interested in this album I would think know about Madonna and her music. Wouldn't it be great to have all her hits on one collection? Not to mention two brand new and amazing songs \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\". I cannot stop listening to this great album. My feet are killing me from all the dancing. You can crank up your stereo and play this cd, and dance the night away. Thats honestly what I did. I say go for it and pick up this album, from one of the world's greatest artist.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Who cares about mainstream? Raw emotion behind the music along with originality is far better. This is what is aimed for here and the result is awesome. This CD will not be placed in storage anytime soon. The music is super soulful, smooth, slick, phat and all that!
0810983915|5.0|Oh, poor Greg Heffley! Somehow, he must manage to endure his summer vacation. You see, Greg knows his parents expect him to be outside enjoying the warm weather during the \\"three-month guilt trip\\" as he calls it, but he despises the outdoors. He only wants to spend those 90 precious days inside and in front of the television with the blinds drawn and the lights turned off --- all the better to play one video game after another.    Greg reflects on how the first part of the summer, when he actually did venture outside, was not exactly stellar. His best friend, Rowley, invited him to go to the local country club swimming pool with his family every day. The first mishap was asking a new neighbor girl to go with them and then watching her find romance with the lifeguard. Moving onward while musing about some people's lack of loyalty, Greg felt free to kvetch about the service at the country club, griping whenever the waiter forgot to put an umbrella in his drinks. Eventually, Rowley informed Greg that he was no longer invited to go to the pool with his family.    However, Greg's escapades at the country club pool pale beside his misadventures at the town pool. Since swimmers must walk through the locker room, Greg has seen some sights of men soaping down that have marred him for life --- the illustrations of this traumatic event are hysterical.    Meanwhile, Greg and his dad bond over the appallingly saccharine Li'l Cutie comic, which they both despise. But Dad has his issues with Greg's summer vacation lifestyle, calling him at noon each day to be sure he isn't still in bed. Greg has had to perfect a chipper wide-awake voice for these occasions, despite the fact that the parental calls always wake him. Dad appears to be a bit grumpy about other things, too, such as Mom's minute-by-minute calls to him at work, complete with detailed updates on the younger Manny's potty-training progress.    Greg sometimes hits the nail right on the head. He comments that his big brotherRodrick, being the first born, has had every second of his babyhood recorded for posterity, with photos of Rodrick's every experience, such as his first time eating peas --- and also his second time eating peas. Mom's documentation of child #2's progression is much sketchier. The family scrapbook includes a photo of Greg soon after his birth, one of Mom carrying newborn Greg home, and then skips to \\"Gregory's sixth birthday party,\\" followed by \\"Gregory's first day of middle school.\\"    Greg's wry commentary covers the unexpected pleasures of having your hair cut in an actual beauty salon (TV, tabloids galore, and plenty of gossip), the completely reasonable terror of \\"the muddy hand,\\" and a shared commercial venture with Rowley that goes quite badly. One laugh-out-loud interlude describes Greg's mandatory participation in a Mom-invented \\"Reading is Fun\\" club, complete with books she has chosen, including LITTLE WOMEN, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES and other classics adolescent boys are sure to find riveting. Greg concludes that a classic must be \\"at least fifty-years-old, and some person or animal has to die at the end.\\"    There aren't many books that I sit right down to devour cover to cover the minute I get my hands on them, but I am compelled to do just that as soon as I discover a new Diary of a Wimpy Kid. And this latest entry is no exception. As usual, it had me chortling throughout. Whether or not you're a member of the actual target audience is entirely irrelevant to the amount of pleasure to be had in this worthy addition to the Wimpy Kid series.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B000YABIQ6|4.0|It is not a good thing to admit that since I purchased this DVD set, I have spent the last two weeks watching every episode and listening to every audio narration by the stars, director, producer and costumer involved in the outstanding show.  Yes, I am consumed by the world, the writing, the look and the characters in \\"Mad Men\\" and I believe that creator Matthew Weiner's program will go down in television history as<br />one of the best ever.<br /><br />One of the hallmarks of the show, is the articulate, clever and erudite dialogue spoken by the characters.<br /><br />That is why it rankles and annoys me that the word \\"amazing\\" is used ad nauseum throughout the audio narrations.  It is spoken by Weiner, in such sentences as \\"Look at this outfit. So amazing\\". Or by a director, \\"This actor, his performance is so amazing.\\" Or an actor, \\"The writing is so amazing.\\"  Or when speaking about a cinematographer: \\"His camera work is amazing.\\"  The paucity, degradation and vapidity of the English language, as it spoken in 2008 (when the DVD was produced) contrasts so vividly and poorly with the higher intelligence of speech that once came off the lips of English speaking men and women in the early 1960's.<br /><br />But despite the ever odious presence of the word \\"amazing\\" there is quite enough in this DVD to satisfy the most crazed MAD MEN fan.
0385504225|1.0|Perhaps this was my wasted opportunity to read something else.    Mr. Brown is being slammed for being a poor writer.  I am not a writer and therefore not qualified to critique his style, but his topic and his main characters were tedious and annoying.    Professor Langdon (The Da Vinci Code) chases around Europe with a member of the French police, searching for the Holy Grail, ultimately the blood relative of Christ.  He is convinced by the historical log of the keepers of records.  He's okay with this.    Next Professor Langdon (Angels and Demons) chases above and below the streets of St. Peter's seeking antimatter, set to destroy the Basilica.  He's okay with that.    Finally Professor Langdon (The Lost Symbol) is in D.C., and totally adamant against anything proposed by any number of professional persons engaged in Masonic rites and politics.  \\"It just cannot be so!\\"  \\"It is just impossible!\\"  \\"It is just a myth!\\"  (I really got tired of his denials.)  I had the feeling that Professor Langdon had gotten dumber by the book and that now, as he refers to his classes and students, he might be teaching the remedial classes at Harvard.    Give me a break.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I loved the oldies and the new. His video is really good and the song is good too. I thought it was a great video since it told the story of the song and some don't.<br /><br />Georgia On My Mind was very well done and as a resident of the state I have heard just about every version. Michael's is one of the best.<br /><br />I would suggest this for purchase to all of my friends who miss the old style of music that takes us back to our childhoods. It is easy listening at it's best!
B000002ADT|5.0|With this album we're definately dealing with one of those \\"what more can one say\\" sort of situations when it comes to reviewing it,mainly because of it's acclaim for listeners outside the jazz sphere. But whatever it ended up being this is Miles and jazz at some of it's very finest. One of the greatest things about it is that it definately leaves creative impressions on you. Considering all the great musicianship that went into the creation of music such as the best known tunes on this album \\"So What\\" and \\"All Blues\\" alone and THAN actually get captured into the spirit of these song's modalities sounding so free and effortless.....your definately inspired to express yourself in some way. I am a painter who listens to music while I paint. The range I listen to is very diverse but when I am in the middle of a rendering that's particularly interesting I find myself drawn heavily towards listening to jazz and funk because,despite the division lines some people choose to put between them both styles of music over a free wheeling yet technically demanding style of music that is very fluid in tempo and rhythm. This being the beginning of modal jazz,where the harmonies and melodies were less structured that liquid quality that Jimmy Cobb,Paul Chambers and in particular those dramatic chord blocks of Bill Evans really do bring out the artist in you whatever the style of it happens to be. \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" is particularly interesting in that the song not only has more of an uptempo flavor of the song but it gives the opportunity for 'Trane and Cannonball to let loose on their saxes. Interestingly enough,even though Miles' whole \\"tugging at the ears softly\\" approch to his horn tends to take presidents in both his solos and the compositions themselves you can hear in 'Trane's many solos throughout this recording that his sound is actually beginning to edge into that free spirited and transcendent style of playing that would culminate six years after this on his own [[ASIN:B0018RWD6I A Love Supreme]]. Both the original and alternate take of \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" find Miles (and on the latter his sax players more over) really re-introducing that so important \\"spanish tinge\\" into the music. Miles was and would continue to be very deeply interested in Spanish melodies and styles of playing and this would be one of his most significant uses of the form aside from what he'd accomplish with Gil Evans on [[ASIN:B000002AH7 Sketches of Spain]]. \\"Blue In Green\\" is for sure the most \\"modal\\" of the songs as the bluesy tempo seems to stretch out into infinity. So many things were happening in jazz in the late 50's and early 60's. The most sigificant of the classic 33RPM long playing records were coming out at the time and with vigor. And that Miles and his various quartets and quintets were responsible for over a handfull of those records points to the legendary status his music and his general presense continues to have.his on his own [[ASIN:B0018RWD6I A Love Supreme]].

B000000OA6|5.0|Queen ceased to tour in 1986; rumors that Mercury was ill began to surface in 1987, and music videos and photographs associated with the 1991 INNUENDO showed him disturbingly thin.  Mercury was a shy, very private person who disliked personality publicity; nonetheless, on 23 November 1991 he released a press statement, admitting that he had AIDS.  Astonishingly, he died the following day, even while INNUENDO remained on the charts in many nations around the world.<br /><br />INNUENDO was created by Queen in full knowledge that it would likely be Mercury's last project and many of the selections are emotionally charged, some very openly so on the subject of personal mortality.  This is particularly true of the opening and closing tracks, the title \\"Innuendo\\" and the closing \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" both astonishing cuts that show the band surpassing itself.  Insiders indicate that \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" was Mercury's own very ironic take on the issue of AIDS-related dementia; \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" has a nostalgic meloncholia.  All four are extraordinary, emotionally and musically wrenching, showing Queen at its best.  But Queen was like most other bands in at least one sense: their albums always included one or two pieces that could be described as commercial filler and now and then even a clunker or two.  INNUENDO is no exception.<br /><br />\\"Headlong\\" was chosen as the opening single for the American market, and it is easy to see why: it is a straight forward rocker well-written, expertly performed, and without the emotional or intellectual depth that Americans shy away from in terms of radio airplay. Even so, it is the sort of song that Queen could do without five minutes of thought--and the \\"boomp-diddy-diddy, boomp-diddy-diddy-do\\" refrain is hardly inspired.  \\"I Can't Live With You,\\" \\"Don't Try So Hard,\\" \\"Ride The Wild Wind,\\" \\"All God's People,\\" and \\"The Hitman\\" are much the same: commercial rock performed as only Queen could, which is to say beautifully done, but not really approaching the full scope of the band's abilities.  INNUENDO also has a clunker or two.  The first of these is \\"Delilah,\\" Mercury's ode to his pet housecat.  In truth, the piece starts out well.  But while the music remains strong throughout, the lyrics faulter and ultimately seem trivial and self-indulgent.  And then there is \\"Bijou,\\" which is merely maudlin in a calculated sort of way.<br /><br />When all is said and done, INNUENDO is very much \\"old school\\" Queen, anthem-like, exotic, an odd mixture of flash-bang and cool introspection, and including several extraordinary songs that transcend the rest of the album, which is on balance very good.  Whatever his health issues at the time, Mercury's voice was never better, flowing across four octaves and then some; Deacon, May, and Taylor spot on their performances as well.  It is not a perfect album.  Few albums are.  It may not even be the \\"best\\" Queen album--many would give that title elsewhere.  Even so, the presence of \\"Innuendo,\\" \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad,\\" \\"These Are The Days of Our Lives,\\" and the incredibly soaring \\"The Show Must Go On\\" make INNUENDO an absolute must-have.<br /><br />In the months before his death Mercury recorded as many tracks as possible, and these were worked with by his surviving band mates to create the 1995 MADE IN HEAVEN, which is technically the last recording Queen released with Mercury as vocalist.  All the same, and in spite of its flaws, INNUENDO \\"feels\\" more akin to Mercury's exit: his voice has grace and power, and while a fair number of songs on the recording are somewhat beneath his talents--and the talents of his bandmates--it is overall quite haunting.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewernot really approaching the full scope of the band's abilities.  INNUENDO also has a clunker or two.

B00002N9ER|5.0|I installed these in the 'saddlebags' of my Chevy Avalanche and they work very well.  I actually used some special fasteners from Lowes to use as I was installing these in plastic.  They have a very firm grip on the flashlight and it looks like these will last a long time.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love this album, much to my own surprise. I was a little turned off at first when I saw some of these classic songs. Sometimes great songs that get redone turn out lacking, but not the case this time. Michael Buble is able to take the classics and enhance them with his own style.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|First off I'll say that I've only owned cassette tapes of the Beatles and never considered buying the 1987 (that's a guess) remasters because of the many mediocre reviews of their sound. I was obviously excited when I heard that a box set of both mono and stereo versions of the entire Beatles catalog was being released. Again, I've waited for the reviews, and while most are positive including the professional reviews, there are some negatives. It's for that reason I purchased only A Hard Day's Night and Abbey Road in stereo to decide for myself.   I demo'd both discs on a better that average 2 channel audio system and then on a 3.1 channel system driven buy a modern A/V amp. Using the 2 channel audio system I'd say from the get go that both disc recordings sound a bit dated, thin, and stuck between the speakers. Voices were recessed in the mix and and to really get the best out of the discs, I had to raise the volume on the amp. Bass was heavy handed particularly on Abbey Road with the songs Come Together, Something, And Oh Darling just to name three. Tape hiss is audible on Abbey Road but I can live with that. I'd say I was more impressed with the stereo version of A Hard Day's Night than Abbey Road.   To get the best out of these discs, they need to be run through a full range 3.1 channel system using your A/V receiver in one of it's DSP modes via a digital input. Here the sound is spread out giving the recordings more dimension and better separation of voices. Voices are more centered and the sound is more palatable and full and extends outside of the speakers creating a more lifelike venue. It's the only way to really enjoy the discs for my money.    The discs alone are average.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This is the original American NTSC release; it is much-much CLEARER than the European PAL version. So, prefer to buy it guys. An d have in mind that 99% of the (PAL) DVD players in Europe DO support American NTSC playback!    5 stars out of 5:   For the missing videos, please purchase the previous 2 video collections:    [[ASIN:6305610444 Madonna - Video Collection 1993-99]]    ENJOY!
1595141715|3.0|This book is interesting to read because of the style the author chose. Using cassettes as a vehicle. He did an excellent job of describing how human beings are connected, that our words and our actions have unforeseen consequences. However, he sets up a contradiction by suggesting that we have a responsibility to other people to be kind, and yet suggests that the main character in the book is not responsible for her own actions. To realize this requires maturity of the mind which most teenagers don't yet possess. Therefore, I'm sure without intending to, this author has written a book that on the surface teenagers may be drawn to for the good things it does without being aware of the contradiction it sets up in the psyche. Simply be honest before you extol its virtues!

0061914177|5.0|I picked up this book this morning before a flight - read the book on the flight, cover to cover, could not put it down. Gary's passion is completely infectious. I'm someone who had delayed picking up the book because I thought \\"well I'm not looking to start my own business, I'm happy with what I have\\" - let me tell you this book has completely changed the way I'm approaching my life - not just my job. Everyone can benefit from Crush It.    Gary's ability to convey his passion and his ideas in such a down to earth manner gives you the confidence to truly believe that if you've got the passion and the drive you can build your own personal brand.
B001OW5O36|2.0|My daughter received this book (paperback; no pop-up) as a gift for her fifth birthday and we love it!  I immediately ordered three in the pop-up version for gifts for friends.  We received the books and the pop-ups did not work.  Their placement in the book also made the story sound choppy.  We sent them back!  Great book.  Just don't purchase the pop-up version.
B0029NY9YO|4.0|The movie was a little bit dark (the superheroes in this parallel universe literally kill their enemies) but I found it entertaining throughout.  The movie starts with the murder of The Comedian, a sometimes hero, most times a nasty bully acting as a hero.  He was part of a group of masked adventurers called the Watchmen.  Most of the Watchmen were retired but they get together at the funeral and each has their memories of the group that go back to the 1940's.    There is also a \\"doomsday\\" clock that slowly moves closer to 12:00.  All the television pundits believe that Dr. Manhattan has the answer.  Dr. Manhattan is a brilliant scientist who absorbed a huge radiation blast and became a blue skinned mutant that has the ability to alter his size, teleport and split into different bodies. He also seems to parade around naked much of the time and is not modest about full frontal nudity.   He is the most powerful of the Watchman and is virtually indestructible.      Throughout the movie, the story is focused on on of the Watchmen's quest to find out who is trying to murder the group members and the dark daliances of the Comedian from him trying to rape another hero, to his brutilization of the Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war including the woman who carries his child.    Nixon plays a big part as he was elected to a third term in this parallel world.    I found the movie very fast paced which is the opposite of what the critics had said and wouldn't mind a sequel if one is in the works.
