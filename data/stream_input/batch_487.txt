0783228457|5.0|Max Renn (James Woods) is a small-time cable station operator (channel 83) who stumbles onto something big. In his quest for ever more bizarre / shocking programming, he is introduced to a \\"show\\" called VIDEODROME (aka: video circus or arena) that appears to be the real deal- snuff television! Though he believes the violence to be fake, Max is intrigued and mystified by the sadism and total lack of plot. He feels that videodrome could be the next big thing that hits the airwaves! Alas, he soon finds out that the video he's been watching is having a strange effect on / in his mind. Max begins hallucinating to the point where reality becomes a cloudy grey area. His masochistic girlfriend Nicki (Deborah Harry) disappears into the videodrome world, never to be seen again except via television. Max discovers that a nefarious government organization is behind videodrome and plans on using it to create a whole new society. Can they be stopped before we become a nation of killer-couch potatoes? Watch and see! David Cronenberg (Scanners, The Brood) weaves yet another web of terror for us to get caught up in. This is one of my favorites. Highly recommended...
B00001OH7U|5.0|Every song is incredible. From dance to pop to crooning to hard rock An arguement can be made for each song being one of the six best songs ever done by bowie. <br /> <br />This album has three of bowies most known and popular songs, Station to Station, Golden Years and TVC15 , the amazing thing about this album is that they are NOT the best songs. Word on a Wing, Wild is the Wind and Stay are simply some of the best songs recorded by anyone. <br /> <br />This album has always been in my top 10 from the day it was released
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is the first Audioslave album with a follow up due to be released in May 2005. I took a gamble on purchasing this CD not really knowing what to expect. However, I can literally say this is an amazing album release. These band members are talented and there is no doubt about that. The album track listing starts off with Cochise which has a heavy set Rock theme. The styles of each song differs and its differances is what makes this album stand out. Several of these songs like Show Me How To Live, What You Are and Shadow On The Sun have become radio staples. Or for the more hard rock fans, the songs like Cochise, Set If Off and Exploder will suit them.<br /><br />Personally I found that this album has it all, punk rock, soft rock, hard rock with alittle bit of grunge added in to spice up the flavour. I enjoy listening to this CD and any fan of Nickelback or Creed should enjoy this helping from Audioslave.
B000002JKA|5.0|It's sad to see stupid little pathetic boys like him who think MTV is the best thing inside a market for stupid minds. How can you compare Good Charlotte with Dream Theater??? How f****d up you are.  <br />If something appears on MTV it's just for one thing: sell-out, idiotic music, repetitive, meaningless, period. Let's describe the album for the people who are right and think Dream Theater is one of the best progressive-metal bands ever... <br />I think this album is very deep, it has a dark and aggressive feeling. One of the best albums of our time. PERIOD.
0441172717|5.0|Hailed as one of the greatest works of science fiction in the history of the genre, this book, along with other writers such as Arthur C. Clark and Ray Bradbury, is definitely in a select company. While so much is written on how much it impacted science fiction, I find the focus of the book to be on both science and religion. The messianic journey of Paul Atredies to his ascendancy as the Muad Dib of the Fremen peoples and of the planet Arrakis is a tale told with a specific focus.  <br /> <br />The style of the literature is one where important points/events are highlighted and then time jumps forward to the next important event. What we are left with to fill the holes is our own imagination at work. For example, we never read about what happens in the time period between Paul's joining of the Fremen and his eventual ascendency as a man of importance. The chapter following the end of the second part of the book is a high speed run through a series of events leading to the important reason for the third part of the book: the prophetic escalation of Paul to become leader of the desert tribes. Yet again, in the third part of the book we are not given details on how the Fremen take over Arakeen. Frank Herbert leaves the savageries of battle to our imagination. What is important is what happens both before and after.  <br /> <br />Throughout this book we are reminded again and again that the focus is on the messianic journey of Paul along with a fantastic description of the planet where this occurred: the Arrakis. The story itself is told beautifully and through a creativity that is rarely seen, Frank Herbert is able to create a very realistic people who will eventually lead the Prophet into battle.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become introduced to great science fiction. So many writers have borrowed from this work, that it's familiarity is almost as commonplace as The Lord of the Rings. It's been tried and re-tried, but the original Dune series still stands as the quintessinial work of Science Fiction <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have been such a big fan of mariah all my life. i just love this album sooo much! mariah has definetely emancipated herself. i dont know why someone would call 'its like that' a filler, it was written by mariah manuel seal john austin and jermaine dupri. the whole album is just magnificent!
B000000H57|5.0|If BLOODY KISSES was their \\"underdog wins the Super Bowl\\" album, then OCTOBER RUST is TON defending their crown, and crushing the competition in the process.  It's hard for me to say which album is better.  It depends on your point of view, and, for that matter, how you're feeling.  OR is more mature, a band at the top of their game, willing to take chances and experiment.  BK was their rising to the top, finding their sound, and their way.  If BK is their REVOLVER, then OR is their SGT. PEPPER'S.  I like REVOLVER better myself, but the majority embraced SGT. PEPPER'S.  OR is their outdoor album-BK is their haunted house or mausoleum album.  Both have such strong imagery and intense emotion that, in the end, I think they sit side by side, like twin towers during their creative peek.  As far as OR itself, it's a masterpiece, plain and simple.  Nothing in the modern rock or pop world even comes close (to BK either).  Beauty, love, obsession, longing, depression, resignation, etc.-it's all here, with a very woodsy/foresty sheen to it.  What's sets this album apart from the others (even BK) is that keyboards dominate throughout.  Josh Silver's presence has never been as blatant as it is here on OR.  Sweeping grand piano, gothic keyboards, cheesy (almost) casio-type organ, not to mention other styles are all present on OR, sometimes several at the same time.  If OR is better than BK (and let's be honest-that's arguable), it's not because it's more polished or because the production is better, but  because it's more melodic.  On no other TON album does Peter Steele have more songs that contain actual melodies (strong, memorable ones too) where he's actually singing than on OR.  If anything sets this album apart from all the others, it's that.  For me, HAUNTED is the best song.  I know a lot of you feel LOVE YOU TO DEATH is, but no song moves me more than HAUNTED.  From 6'47\\" til the end of the song is the most powerful, tear inducing music I've ever heard-EVER!!!  Contrary to what another reviewer felt, I rewind this track continuously, never tiring of a song so filled with passion, obsession, sadness, loss, and yes-LOVE.  This song (and LOVE YOU TO DEATH) is Peter Steele's attempt to break through man's (any man) unwillingness (or inability) to truly express his deepest emotions without fear of rejection or ridicule.  To put ourselves 'out there', and not worry about the consequences, is one of the most empowering (and freeing) things anyone can do, yet most of us rarely display this level of courage.  Yes, there's some filler tracks on the album.  But, there are no weak songs here.  TON puts themselves 'out there' with OCTOBER RUST, and succeeds in a big way-This is truly A TIMELESS CLASSIC.
0679411585|5.0|First off, I want to confess that I was drawn to this book after watching the movie roughly 20,000 times.  I don't read too many books, but felt I had to pick up this one.  <br /> <br />That said, I've never read a book that moved me so much.  This book is unique in so many ways.  First off, I'd say at least 1/3 of the book (probably more) is made up of direct quotes, taken straight from interviews with the soldiers who survived that bloody battle.  Col. Hal Moore will set up the scene, then let the soldier's own words tell the actual story.    <br /> <br />Secondly, this book isn't told entirely from the US point of view.  While writing the book, Col. Moore and Joe Galloway spent a great deal of time meeting with Lt. Gen. Nguyen Huu An, commander of the Vietnamese battalion that Moore was facing that day.  How many war books actually give you first hand knowledge of what the enemy was doing, straight from the enemy's mouth?   <br /> <br />Lastly, the non-fighting aspect of the story.  Moore calls the war's innocent victims the \\"Golden Star Children\\".  Those who had to deal with the death of a father, a brother, a son, a husband.  I have to say, the room got a little dusty when I was reading through this chapter, and I'm not normally prone to dusty rooms, if you know what I mean.   <br /> <br />In closing, outstanding book that is a must read, whether you loved the movie or hated the movie.
1592400876|4.0|Mind Your Commas: Book Offers Proper Grammar With a (Correctly Used) Dash of Humor  <br />Review by Susan E. Fisher <br />\\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\" by Lynne Truss is a grammar.   It discusses in great, but not excruciating, detail the proper use of commas, semicolons, apostrophes, dashes and those other particular, little companions of the English language. If these facts alone are not enough for you to stop reading, do read on. You may be the ideal candidate to become a fan of this witty, best-selling book. <br />Here are three quick takeaways: <br />1. \\"Its\\" vs. \\"it's.\\"  Know your apostrophes of omission. <br />Do you know the difference between \\"it's\\" and \\"its\\"? (Answer: The punctuation mark in \\"it's\\" is the apostrophe of omission. You use the apostrophe to replace the \\"i.\\" \\"It's\\" means \\"it is.\\") <br />2. Be consistent with commas in a series. <br />Which sentence has the correct punctuation?  <br />* The colours of the Union Jack are red, white, and blue. <br />* The colours of the Union Jack are red, white and blue. <br />The answer will vary depending on your adopted model of punctuation. The most important thing is to be consistent. Inconsistencies suggest you don't know what you are doing. <br />3. Be particularly sensitive with electronic communications. <br />The dangers of disregarding or abusing grammar are particularly great in the Internet age. With the ready combination of word processing software, email and the Web at our fingertips, everyone has become an author. This is one of Truss' insights. Top managers, including CEOs, who once were shielded by their own lack of grammatical know-how by in-house editors, PR managers and other handlers, are now free to dash off ill-conceived messages to customers and business partners at lightning speed. <br />The blogging environment is even worse for sticklers, a label Truss gives the lovers of language who both lovingly and doggedly stick by the rules. The bulk of bloggers are cavalier with language, showing little regard for the fine points of grammar, punctuation or even spelling. Once out on the wild, untamed Web, ill-constructed sentences and typos can have the shelf life of Twinkies; they may never completely disappear.  <br />A CEO with an Ivy League pedigree can come off like a dimwit. A CEO, who recently wrote our company, thanked us for the \\"priveledge\\" of reading our newsletter. One of our competitors blasted this message to a potential customer: \\"For more inforamtion on our e-newsletter services, please see....\\" (Just in case you missed it, \\"priveledge\\" should be \\"privilege\\" and \\"inforamtion\\" should be \\"information.\\") <br />The Impact of Errors <br />Do you realize the impact you are making when you introduce errors in your electronic messages? Do you even realize the errors you make? Of course, there's a difference between simply slipping up with a typo and making a grammatical error out of ignorance. Those typos can be forgiven, but ignorance is unacceptable. <br />Still, the prospect of reading a grammar book may sound as appealing as drinking cod liver oil. It's something we know is good for us but seems a bit old fashioned, and we fear it may leave a bad taste in the mouth. Truss serves grammar to us with a spoon full of sugar (much like that upright symbol of British civility, Mary Poppins.) \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" opens with a title that is a reference to a joke and keeps you amused along the tidy, 204-page way.  <br />(You see, there's this gun-totting panda that enters a bar and \\"eats, shoots and leaves.\\" The bear, it turns out, is merely fulfilling his destiny as defined by a punctuation-challenged wildlife guide. The guide reads: \\"Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.\\") <br />Truss Makes It Fun <br />Get it? Okay. If that joke does not quite elicit a hardy belly laugh, hang on for a few giggles. Truss manages a mean feat, something your third or fourth or fifth or sixth grade teacher may have failed to accomplish: She makes learning about grammar actually fun. Fortunately for us Yankees, Truss is British. She has that dry wit we've come to love in those clever British sitcoms broadcast on PBS.  <br />By the way, nothing is Americanized in the American-version of the book. We get it in full \\"colour\\" without any superimposed U.S. laugh track in the edition by Penguin Group (USA). In the latest edition, Truss offers us a little update, explaining how she is struck by her own heady success with the book. Much to her surprise and delight, \\"Eats\\" was the \\"runaway No. 1 British bestseller,\\" and it quickly climbed the U.S. bestseller charts.      <br />Don't mistake Truss' humor for a lack of seriousness. The writer is passionate about her subject. She confesses a desire to join the militant wing of the Apostrophe Protection Society and blasts the careless individuals who ignore the gods of grammar. She writes, \\"No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice. If you still persist in writing, `Good food at it's best,' you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\"  <br />Caring About Grammar <br />More important than tickling our funny bone about seemingly obscure points, Truss makes us truly care about grammar. Mispunctuation can lead to dangerous misunderstanding. Consider the impact of a misplaced comma in this example cited by Truss:  \\"A woman, without her man, is nothing\\" versus \\"A woman, without her, man is nothing.\\" See the difference one swift keystroke can make? <br />As a child of the free-wheeling, open-classroom 1970s, I must confess to never having had a formal lesson in such niceties as proper placement of the semicolon.  Actually, I don't recall cracking open a grammar book until a rather stern editor at my first newspaper job handed me a basic text. It was more than a hint; it was a lifeline. <br />When is the last time you had a grammar lesson? Perhaps it's time to go back to school on this important subject, for your own sake and for the sake of your business. You can start by cracking open \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves.\\"  At the very least, it may crack you up. At best, it may save you a client or two.  <br />Gaudere's Law: any post made to point out a spelling or grammar error will invariably contain a spelling or grammar error.   <br />
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Some dude gave her a 1 star review and called Alicia a sucka...he needs to get a dictionary or something...pass the 2nd grade...have your own opinion, but back it up. <br /> <br />Diary is a pretty good CD...I don't listen to a lot of RnB, mostly just hip hop, but Alicia Keys stands out to all the Ciaras, Beyonces and Ashantis out there. Music-wise and personality wise. Her voice tops all those other artists with their synthesized voices and boring repetative club beats. She actually has musical talent other than singing (piano, duh) <br /> <br />anyway, go out and get this album if you want a taste of real un-synthesized RnB
B00005JNRB|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Cussler/Dirk Pitt books so, this was a lot <br />of fun for me. Granted some things are changed from the books but,this isn't too much of a problem. <br />The actors all do a good job. Matthew is great as Pitt and seemed <br />to capture all of Dirk's best qualities. (Brave, resourceful,tough,willful,etc.) <br />Steve Zahn was good as Al as well. No, he didn't \\"look\\" the part but, he had the character nailed I thought. <br />The action is very good and not the over the top CGI junk that seems to fill movies these days. It's more along the lines of the Indiana Jones movies.  <br />The story and the mysteries involved are done well and you actually have to look into things a little like the characters rather than just have it handed too you as the standard Hollywood action flick tends to do.  <br />The short version is this is a well made, fun, action filled movie worth your time and money. Sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|OK this album rocks the songs in it are just amazing there are no fillers and u won't skip songs her voice is outstanding as always my favorite songs are :  <br />1)STAY THE NIGHT  <br />2)WE BELONG TOGETHER <br />3)CIRCLES  <br />4)JOYRIDE  <br />5)GET YOUR NUMBER <br />Even though it's not her best work to date because i really think butterfly it's a masterpiece it's definetly better than charmbracelet and glitter excluding the songs through the rain and lead the way . <br />overall u should buy it u won't regret it the only thing that's missing here it's the typical mariah ballads that i personally love like my all or can't take that away. <br />the album it's really smooth,easy to listen  has some old school rnb thing that i really like .  <br />buy it support the biggest diva of all time because a woman like this it's only born every 10000 years ...... lol

B0006GAOJA|3.0|Raging Bull (1980). Rated \\"R\\". Running Time: 2 hours, 09 mins.<br />Directed by Martin Scorsese. Written by Jake LaMotta (book) with Joseph Carter, Peter Savage. Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (screenplay).<br /><br />Watching this movie again reminds you just how incredible an actor Robert DeNiro is and he actually gained weight for this role of \\"Jake La Motta\\".  Yup! That's Roberet DeNiro's real belly.<br />  The close-up shots of the boxing scenes are gruesome, but shown in black & white for the entire film is give it a much more dramatic effect.  The film changes to color for the home movie scenes.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Cathy Moriarty, Joe pesci, Frank Vincent, Nicolas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana, Mario Gallo, Michael Badalucco, John Turturro.<br />  The real Jake La Motta is portrayed here as a boxer, but as a man, he was over-masculated, macho, a womanizer, cheater, violent and foul-mouthed.  He only cries when he knows he wrongfully took a dive and almost lost his boxing career.  Then he cries when thrown in jail insisting he is not a bad person.  Well, being a bad person is what got him there.<br />  DeNiro is so believable in this role you forget that it is DeNiro.  You might like this film better than those [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Rocky]] films.<br />  The real Jake La Motta was a consultant on the film.  Martin Scorsese appears as the Barbizon stagehand.<br /><br />Academy Award and Golden Globe Award won by Robert DeNiro- Lead Actor.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|~wevieR~<br /><br />Mars Volta, how I love you, how you confuse me, how I love the fact that you confuse me.  Continuing their unique mix of various musical genres and representing their art image, the serious half of At The Drive-in released an unusual LP of their called \\"Frances the Mute.\\"  Who is this mute called by the name of Frances?  I don't know, but does anyone bother lookin' deep within an album title?  \\"Frances the Mute\\" is not really an LP as the group say as it is a \\"tribute\\" album to a lost friend of theirs, which makes some sense by the new ideas this LP contributes.<br /><br />What every reviewer says is true: the album only has 5 songs, even though there are 12 tracks.  The first four songs have their own separate tracks, while the last song last up to EIGHT TRACKS, in order to avoid being an EP release.  Pay attention to the fine print, and don't get confused like I did; it took me two weeks to figured out the idea.  It was a clever idea from the band, but it's still mind-numbing.<br /><br />Onward to the list of songs for which their names defy reason from the norm, as usual from The Mars Volta, \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" blew my mind away. It starts off with an enchanted folk melody before it goes off with some quick-ass heavy tech riffs, blended with Cedric's occassional mild spanish vocals.  It's tough yet soothing, twisted en la cabeza, and definitely my favorite song of the five.  \\"The Widow\\", the group's first single for this album, is the \\"shortest\\" of the bunch and more mainstreamed than the bunch.  It's a slow ballad that adds the mood of its somber by its hollowing backgrounds, ending it with the echoes of carnival-esque creepy organs.<br /><br />\\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\", while not my favorite song, got me to love my musical heritage for the first time; THIS is what Rock en Espanol should sound like: pulsive and on-key.  Frontman Cedric Zavala is practially singing the whole track in spanish, sans the parts where the tejano tunes kick in (Thank you for making me love latin music, MV).  \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\", and what a long title the name is, was slow to listen to at a few tries.  But once I got into it, my mind wanders as I became hypnotized by its haunting female chants and echoed guitar riffs, eventually gettin' the meat of the song, consisting of a slow industrial ballad evolving into hard rock composure, all with trumpets playin' in the background, ending with a similar ballad of \\"Cygnus.\\"  It's a depressing song once someone gets the mood of it, and holy or not, this mystified song works well for me.<br /><br />And last, though certainly least, is the song that's so unnecessary long (32 minutes long, to be exact), it takes up to eight tracks to fill the load.  \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" is a mixed-bag of various ambitions.  The first three tracks of the song are good enough: one has a \\"Kill Bill\\" vibe, while the second takes a break with mostly solo guitar acts and constant moanings, and the other plays as if it's preparing for something big, though something big didn't happen afterwards.  The experince of listening tracks 4-6 of the song is like the experience of running in a hot desert hoping for civilized land: it's exhausting and leaves me dehydrated.  Maybe not the dehydrated part, but the tracks still left me drowsy.  The final two tracks, though short, add closure to the song, going back to chorus of the first track of this song, and returning back to what it once was, back to \\"Cygnus.\\"  \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" is one song I'm better off without, and I'm thankful the song are separate tracks (I probably couldn't handle listen to the whole song in one sitting).<br /><br />If you look closely on the back cover of the LP, there are \\"sub-tracks\\" below the name of the songs.  Though they're part of one song, they serve the purpose of describing what kind of music direction the song currently serves, and how some can be similar to other songs.  Example:  \\"d. con safo\\" of \\"Cygnus\\", when it plays between 9 and 10 minutes of the song, sounds exactly like \\"d. con safo\\" of the ending of \\"Miranda\\"; pay attention to the names.<br /><br />Speaking of attention, if anyone can tell me the meanings behind the song titles and their lyrics, please e-mail me from my profile.<br /><br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" is like reading a set of poems you don't understand at first, and even if you read it over and over, you still don't get it, though you get the purpose of the set so much that you enjoyed it without reason.  The Mars Volta continues to create new ideas for their music, and this album does a good job of making the music that's complex yet anyone that loves music can get into it.  The song/track list might get confusing at first, and the album does continue the band's trend of being arbitrary way too much, especially on \\"Cassandra Geminni\\", but how can I complain after four out of five songs being so grand?  The artsy compound of this generous album shouldn't be silenced from my recommendation.<br /><br />F naL W02DS: This mute spoke great things.<br /><br />[BEST TRACK] Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus<br /><br />[WEAKEST TRACK] Cassandra Geminniygnus\\", when it plays between 9 and 10 minutes of the song, sounds exactly like \\"d. con safo\\" of the ending of \\"Miranda\\"; pay attention to the names.   <br /> <br />Speaking of attention, if anyone can tell me the meanings behind the song titles and their lyrics, please e-mail me from my profile. <br /> <br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" is like reading a set of poems you don't understand at first, and even if you read it over and over, you still don't get it, though you get the purpose of the set so much that you enjoyed it without reason.

B00007J5VN|5.0|This musical is about wanting to get out of the life you live.  In the case of Shirley Maclaine's character, it's about her finally trying to stop compromising on her ideals of love and quit her hypocritical( hypocritical considering her remarks about truly believing in love) job as a dancehall hostess.  In addition to conversely demonstrating the shallow nature of the Broadway musical dream and how even love can seem insincere on a grand lofty scale, they also inject these ideas with quirky humor which distracts from just how insipid these characters would seem if played straight.  The funny thing about this film is that it is both a satire and completely honest in it's depiction of life.  It also contains excellent choreography and music whose flash demonstrates the appeal of such things.  Depicting all of these differing and seemingly contradictory thoughts makes the viewer not know how they feel about the whole thing.  Personally, after the film was over I was left with the callow sense of whimsy and was amazed at how willing I was to be entertained by this.  Apparently the stage version has a different ending so I hope that at some point I'll be able to see it.
B000002N9L|5.0|a toss off, but brilliantly executed: Prince plays guitar all over this thing, and tosses off one of his funniest, funkiest, and best records. NOT a popular album, and that is not a popular opinion, but I can't help it. The guy's genius knows few bounds.
068987474X|5.0|Anyone who dismisses this book is kidding themselves. \\"No...he really does like me...\\" puh-lease. If he hasn't called, if he doesn't want 'to get intimate' it's just not right. If only i'd read this a year ago I'd have saved *so* much time and tears!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Quite a huge change for Prince. Prince has done a lot of things in his career: generic r&b rockers and ballads. Synth funk. Pure synthezied insanity. Pure dance music. HARD rock and roll. Blues. Beautiful orchestrated ballads. Psychadelic rock. All of these mixed together. But one of the few things Prince ever went hog wild for on any of his albums was Jazz. That changes with this album. <br />The music is brilliant. Prince's grasp of Jazz is as good as his grasp of all other kinds of music. The lyrics aren't as good, but that's not that big of a deal: I pay little attention to his lyrics. So this music is perfect: relaxing at points, other times energetic and moving, it is another album in his continuing creative come back, after the horrible album that was New Power Soul.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Even moreso than usual, I have nothing to tell you about this movie that hasn't been said a million times before.  Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.  As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  It virtually never lets up, and has the visual innovation, technical brilliance and sheer oddness to make feel like it could've gone on for a whole lot longer without getting old.<br /><br />As others have said, this is perhaps the ultimate 'guy film', and it's delightfully violent and perverse without either becoming to grim or seeming like it is solely meant to shock.  Plenty of people are offended by the violence, though it's tough to imagine why considering how over the top most of it is.  Also, others have accused it of being sexist as the majority of the women are in the film are prostitutes and scantily clad. (You'd think the fact that all the men in the movie are killers and criminals and slimebags would offset this and make it merely misanthropic, or perhas *gasp* a sheer piece of absurd fantasy with no real connection to reality, but apparently not)  I find both these causes for offense to be utterly ridiculous, but it is relevant to the certain groups.  So prudes and humorless feminists: Beware! You won't wanna see this movie.  Or, maybe you will, as getting offended seems to be the primary pleasure of those two groups.  But whatever, the people who do wanna see this movie know who they are, and they'll like it.<br /><br />As everyone knows, this movie is divided into 3 major sections.  I like this pattern, as only having a couple relatively brief segments means that things have to get going fast, and that the film has numerous peaks.  Everyone loves to compare this to `Pulp Fiction' though this isn't totally relevant, as though the segments cross over and reference each other, they all stand alone and don't really illuminate each other all that much.  The internal references are just kinda... cool, but they aren't really all that important.  Though there is a slight concern: The segments proceed in decreasing order of quality, so the best parts of the movie are at the beginning.  Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.<br /><br />Most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.  The dialogue and acting are deliberately over the top, a slight caricature of you're stereotypical noir dialogue and mannerisms, which combines with some nearly perpetual voice overs from the primary characters, and lots of sleazy music to complete the noir feel.  The overblown noir stylization is combined with some really bizarre and of the wall characters, such as the scrawny-mute-superhuman-cannibal-serial-killer-farmboy, the misshapen-yellow-pedophile-mancreature and the deadly-asian-ninja-prostitute.  This is all pretty weird, naturally, but it never gets so unusal that it can't be taken seriously.<br /><br />The film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.  The world doesn't look real, exactly, but, of course, it's not really meant to, and there's never any doubt that the actors are there.<br /><br />Despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.  It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.  Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  The core-audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.  Everyone else... I dunno.

B0007OCG4W|1.0|I found absolutely nothing of value in the script or the screenplay of this movie. There was not a single character within this film to identify with in any positive sense whatsoever. If the message of this film is simply to convey that people are manipulative, deceitful, dishonest, jealous, and un-trustworthy; then I suppose it succeeded. I don't mind these subjects being addressed in a film but at the very least done so in an intelligent manner that arrives at a succinct message with purpose. There was no purpose to this film. There was a delivery with no destination. A film need not be uplifting to be of value so long as there is redeeming content and purpose within. This film simply made me want to take a bath with a brillo pad.
0140039589|5.0|Only the British seem to know how to write for children without talking down to them. While telling a gripping adventure about a group of rabbits, Adams also makes a strong statement about the nature of leadership, contrasting the intelligent and intuitive protagonist Hazel with the repressive and authoritarian General Woundwort. The book's environmental message is also as relevant today as when it was written.
B000001ESF|5.0|This cd is such a great cd. rush is a great power trio. thier so awsome. i think thier more of hard rock then progressive. yeah they have thier touchy slow songs but so does zeppelin and aerosmith, and thier both catagorized as hard rock. Also the great drumming of niel piert is great. they know  they have the best drummer and they use him. listen to the temples of syrinx. you cant forget about alex lifesons guitar riffs. he is one of the top 10 best guitar players on my list. Also thiers geddy lee on vocals and bass. I love his voice. prabobly the 5th best singer around. plus i think the nerdy lyrics are good not bad, but better. only they can sound good with this. Alex looks like a girl in the album booklet but who cares, he kiks ass. all around really rockin band. one of the best
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My friend who lives and breaths Gangsta Rap and hates everything else really liked this movie.  Why, because it so well done, and because the music is incredible.  One thing for sure is that the sound and music or top notch.  It is so immersive.  The story will make you sad even if you are tough guy.  This was one of those movies that did not get enough credit.  This is high quality stuff, and it is BARELY PG-13, so don't worry about gore or anything.  Rent it, buy it or see it at the theatre.  Just see it.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Butterfly will always be her best album but this one is quite a bit better than her last few collections.  Her voice is definitely back and soaring without strain at all and it sounds great.  There are many tracks on this disc that sound like the mid-90's Mariah that everyone fell in love with.  Great songs, great vocals, HOT cover, what more could you ask for? Best songs are We Belong Together and Fly Like A Bird.  Buy it!
B00061QJZI|1.0|Sorry, but this movie really really sucked.  I like Will Farrell.  I enjoyed his movie elf, but sorry, this time he blew it.  The whole movie blew it.  I was so excited about seeing this thing , but man did I feel like I wasted my time.  I was trying so hard to laugh, but it just wasn't funny.  Another thing was every single joke was a sex joke.  They tried to get laughs was by doing crude sexual things.  NOT A FUNNY MOVIE
B000001FG5|3.0|I know I say there are some albums I don't really like or songs I can take or leave, but honestly one album I truly split on is everyone else's ever popular Spirits Having Flown.  This 1979 follow up to Fever proved Barry, Robin, and Maurice's \\"comeback\\" wasn't just a flash in the \\"disco\\" pan.  The Gibbs continued to make and break the charts with Spirits.<br /><br />  Tragedy is one of the few songs my non-Gibb honey likes.  It's synthesizers, progressive sound, and basic lyrics set the song and album off and running.  The Bee Gees have a knack for having heavy production and over the top music compared with simplistic lyrics.  When you're alone its a tragedy, duh.  A chart topper naturally. It has explosions, need I say more?<br /><br />  If there is such a thing as a more global monster hit then Tragedy it has to be Too Much Heaven.  The Brothers got in touch with their spiritual sides lyrically and donated the proceeds from the single to UNICEF.  This album is all about production production production.  When you break it down,  Heaven's nothing more than the Brothers sweet lyrics and harmonies. Take for example the Boys' live renditions, just them and a guitar is equally spectacular.  However, the layering and dubs and over-the-top falsetto makes Heaven so grand and universal.<br /><br />  Love You Inside Out  was the third charter from the Spirits album and this one might be my favorite.  The falsetto is a little bit softer, so you can sing along! The raunch factor of the lyrics is evident (even though the original lyrics had to be changed because the suits feared they were too nasty).  >80p I especially enjoy the rhythm and beat changes in this one.  You can dance, nudge, and wink, awl yeah! (Someone just remade this. Fiest, Feast. Something like that.)<br /><br />  Reaching Out is the second slow jam presented.  The lyrics are slightly more delicate, but Barry's high notes crescendo at the end.  Although any Barry fan would naturally love this album, and all his styles are represented here, one of the things I don't like about Spirits is the `Barry featuring Robin and Maurice'  feel.  As usual the best parts of the album are choruses and harmony.  The echoes and ad-libs here make Reaching Out.<br /><br />  The title track Spirits (Having Flown) (Parenthesis!) has its moments.  It's tropical feel is indicative to the rest of the tracks, and Spirits' bongos and grass skirts style is contagious.  The falsetto is much easier here,  and the general listen is a pleasant departure.  I love it when the boys just  `lalala'.<br /><br />  Search Find, however, is loud and over the top.  I usually leave rather than take this song.  The music is very powerful and catchy, but the lyrics are too high and too fast for me to enjoy.  When I finally read and understood the lyrics, I found I actually don't like them. Go fig.<br /><br />  Another leaver is Stop (Think Again). (I never want to see another parenthesis!)  Again the music is very sweet and bluesy, but Barry is too into the falsetto.  The choruses where there is a touch of harmony and soul make the song tolerable.  The Bee Gees falsetto harmony is impeccable, and no one else can do it.  The second half of Spirits really doesn't showcase this as well as the hits.<br /><br />  Having Spirits on record is a real pain. I've got to skip all over the place to hear  Living Together and I'm Satisfied.  Living Together is the one song that it seems Robin sings the verses.  His falsetto is slightly different, and you can understand what he's saying.  When combined with the booming brass music and lower chorus lines, we get a unique delivery.  It is as if the voices are competing here, the opposites that aren't living together.  Yet the high falsetto has balance now with the lower octaves.  It's so good when the arrangement parallels the story being told.<br /><br />  I'm Satisfied returns to the tropical feel, but it's more over the top that Spirits.  It's lyrics are twisted and high, but you can't help but sing along and dance.  Happy go lucky is how I would describe this one. The boys appear to be just having some fun.  One odd thing about Spirits. There is no 'nasty' song.  Each song has a line or two or three about some good loving.  Maybe that's why parts are so fun and addictive.<br /><br />  I really don't know how Until got on this album.  There is an odd demo called In The Heat of the Night that feels better suited, and Until ends this rather fun, lively, and upbeat album on a slow down note.  I'm Satisfied is a much better book end to Tragedy.  Nevertheless, Until is the longest two minutes I know.  I absolutely adore the way Barry can manipulate words, but every other word is unnecessarily slowed on Until.  I listen for about thirty seconds then I'm just bored and itching for a pick up in the song that unfortunately doesn't come.<br /><br />  Spirits Having Flown's unique blend of softness and over the top noise and production is not for everyone.  However, almost by necessity, the Brothers had to jump the gun in order to top the Fever Monster.  The result is The Bee Gees best selling non soundtrack album.  When you think of it that way, my take it or leave it opinion doesn't really matter, does it?  ;0)'s more over the top that Spirits.

B0007GAERG|5.0|The much-anticipated 10th studio album from Mariah Carey is off da hook! The biggest-selling female artist of all time is back with a vengeance. A classic album, amazing production by A-list producers and the prolific songwriting of Mimi herself creates this beautiful masterpiece. Now this is what I call A COMEBACK! <br /> <br />You will not be disappointed getting this record unlike the dismal Charmbracelet which was not one of her strong albums. This album really should come after Butterfly cuz it really picks up from there. From the pumpin' It's Like That, which hit Top 20 on Billboard Hot 100, you will never have to skip a track; it's that good! We Belong Together is such an amazing midtempo number that it was chosen as the 2nd single and the lyrics is filled with sorrow and emotion. Jermaine Dupri did a great job with this one, as he did on Always Be My Baby back then. Shake It Off is another JD number, and its really off the chain!  <br /> <br />Mariah's ballads have somewhat evolved. Here you'll find midtempo ballads that really worked perfectly. Songs like Mine Again, Circles and I Wish You Knew is simply amazing and beautiful. The best one is definitely the gospel-tinged Fly Like A Bird, a soaring ballad that if you listen carefully (a true fan may relate to this), reminds you of a track from her debut CD 'There's Got To Be A Way' which has a close theme and her vocals were similar if not close to that song. It's really a vocal song and Mariah did a perfect job with the high notes. <br />Joy Ride is the most underrated song it seems; it's really good. Mariah's delivery sounds really sincere. <br /> <br />Hip hop numbers like Say Somethin', Stay The Night, Get Your Number and To The Floor really adds the flavor to this already tasteful album. My favorite would be One And Only, which featured Twista. The latter's rap is crazy! Kanye West, The Neptunes, James 'Big Jim Wright', James Poyser were incredible in their productions in this album. <br /> <br />MariahCarey is back on track. As a fan, this is an album that is long overdue. I'm sure more listeners will become fans of her music when they listen to this record. It will not disappoint you at the slightest.
0763611883|5.0|I recently started watching a really great cartoon on the disney channel called 'Charile and Lola'.  I had no clue that the show is actually based on these books by Lauren Child.  The books are funny and imagenative, and show a positive model of sibling reationships.  If you love the book, watch the cartoon too!
B0007GAERG|5.0|For some reason unexplained, I've supported Mariah during her highs, her mediocrity, her lows [and her LOWS...whew, boy] and all her flailings to stay afloat in the music industry.  I'm definitely supporting her during her comeback, so, needless to say, this review is a little biased...okay, a lot biased.  On the CD case for \\"Emancipation...\\" it says this album is dedicated to her \\"real fans\\".   You know the ones.  The fans that listen to her Christmas album year `round, the ones that visit mariahdaily.com...DAILY...you get the point. <br /> <br />I'm definitely one of those fans...I know, total freak, right? <br /> <br />I always thought that Butterfly was her peak and everything she put out since then was all downhill.  Even then, Butterfly was like, **The New Improved Version of Fantasy**  Rainbow seemed like a sad attempt to recreate the magic that was captured in Butterfly with A BUTT LOAD OF CRAPPY TRACKS.  Scratch that.  Rainbow had TWO butt loads [Did I Do That feat Mystical?!?  Yes Mariah, you DID do that track.  And it makes me vomit in my mouth a little bit.]  Same with Charmbracelet...  Cookie cut, formulated and uninspired.  The comparisons are ENDLESS...like she was hanging by her fingernails to keep the image she created on Butterfly.  To any non fanatical person, all the songs on all these albums blended together into this big synthesized, overproduced, pop poo-poo. <br /> <br />On this album, though, Mariah has Emancipated herself from...herself.  She grew up big time on this album.  I have to say that my favorite past Mariah tracks were: <br /> <br />Underneath the Stars <br />Fourth of July <br />Bliss <br />Subtle Invitation <br /> <br />The jazzier, sexier, soulful songs on past albums with a throw back to 70's R&B.  The tracks on \\"Emancipation...\\" follow in the footsteps of these songs big time.  \\"It's Like That\\" isn't even the best song on the album!  The rest of the album is SO INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT from everything she has done in the past.  No tacky 80's cover, no Spanish guitar inspired ballad, no top 40 hip hop samples, no overtly gospel songs about overcoming diversity.  She's singing real time with live musicians here people!  Now there's a concept. <br /> <br />When I bought Charmbracelet, the first time I listened to it wanted to stab myself in the face.  But I gave it time, and many MANY listens, and ::finally:: liked it.  \\"Emancipation...\\" is F***ING amazing first time through.  I don't even have a favorite track.  Most of them are so brilliant for different reasons. <br /> <br />Welcome back Mariah.  Finally, I don't have to bee embarrassed for liking you. <br />
B00003CXA2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and have since I first saw it a decade ago. I have probably seen it 10 times or so, 2 times in the past week, because I have been feeling bad and it was there. I have tried to figure out why I love it so much - and really it's the whole package. I love it's humor, the acting, the dialogue, the unique attractiveness of the main characters. I really believe Tom Hanks can do just about anything. He was amazing in this role. The thing I love the most about this movie was his sincere love for his childhood friend. In fact, I think sincerity describes this movie totally. It's about truth, honesty and love. A sort of surreal/drama/comedy - it always uplifts me and makes me feel good. I recommend it for anyone with a heart, and that's just about everyone, isn't it?
0316779237|5.0|\\"Holidays on Ice\\" is hilarious!  The story about Sedaris working as an elf for a mall Santa is hysterical.  I laughed out loud many, many times.  This book would be a great stocking-stuffer.<br /><br />One little word of warning, some of these stories appear in other books by Sedaris (the Santa story is in \\"Barrel Fever\\"), so don't expect all new material.  However, it's a great collection of short stories for the holidays.
0792833201|4.0|This movie was one ofthe first \\"horror\\" movies i ever saw and i have to say that some parts still send shivers up my spine.  This is a great movie to watch on dark night by yourself.
0316776963|5.0|I've read everything David Sedaris has put into book form, and this, by far, is his best work.  This book finds Sedaris in his prime.  He wasn't the uber-star author he is now while writing this, so it feels humble and honest.  He has really found his voice with this book.  \\"Naked\\" was good, but \\"Me Talk...\\" is fantastic.  I laughed out loud many, many times.  \\"Dress Your Family...\\" was a bit of a letdown for me after this.  \\"Dress\\" is still a great book, he just seems to be more aware of himself as an accomplished writer, and it gets in the way a bit. That doesn't happen with \\"Me Talk...\\" It doesn't feel over-written or self-conscious, it just seems to flow out of him. His readers are lucky to be witnesses to his hilarious and sometimes painful life.<br /><br />Buy this book!
0783114893|5.0|THis movie is one of the best thrillers i have ever seen.  Rutger Hauer gives a phenominal performance. One of the best in the history o psychos.  THis movie is full of classic scenes such as the scene in the truck near the end.  Overall one of the scariest movies i have ever seen without gore.
B0007GAERG|1.0|I just cannot believe the raves I'm reading here for Beyonce's- <br />new-lookalike Mariah's \\"comeback, return to greatness, etc.\\" <br />I ran out to buy this after reading some of these reviews and <br />I am VERY disppointed.  Where are the melodies?  It's all boring <br />hip-hop beats, with Mariah doing her vocal doodles over the <br />rhythm.  There isn't one song that grabs you, not even the ballads.  When I think of how great she was back in the day of \\"Music Box\\", \\"MTV Unplugged\\", \\"Butterfly\\" , etc. I feel like I'll probably never like anything she does from now on.  She's trying too hard to be \\"current\\" instead of just doing what she used to do best, SINGING A REAL SONG.  If you're a fan of the \\"Classic Mariah\\" I would urge you to listen to the soundclips on Amazon before plunking down your hard earned money.  Sorry Mimi, you let me down!
0800177177|4.0|THis , i thought was a great adaptation of dracula.  However, there is a bit of a lull in the second half. Acting is superb and storyline is great. Overall, a very good movie
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm so glad that the VOICE is back. If Charmbracelet was plagued with her whisperings and cooing, this album emancipates Mariah from it, because the VOICE, is literally back. In every song, she uses her big voice and screams, and belts, and truly SINGS! Thank God for that. <br /> <br />Also, I think she has the best voice in the business so another meaning of \\"The VOICE is back\\" would be that Mariah, with the definitice voice, is truly back. <br /> <br />I love every track, but I especially dig SAY SOMETHING & STAY THE NIGHT. For interested buyers, listen to the above mentioned songs and We Belong Together. These tracks alone is worth your money! And here's the good part. There are 10 other song that are quite as good.
B00009P1O0|4.0|'On the Beach' was released by Neil Young in July of 1974, one day after the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young reunion tour hit the road in Seattle, Washington.  Unfortunately, that tour would turn out to be less spectacular than their tour in support of 'Deja Vu' four years previous.  Crosby, Stills and Nash suggested a reunion disc be released but Neil wasn't interested, feeling that CS&N had little to offer.  Interestingly, this particular disc reveals that Young himself had limited ammunition in his own holster.  He might have done quite well to join forces and mix his own best offerings with the similarly limited material CS&N seemed to have at their disposal as the best years of their careers began to wane. <br /> <br />'On the Beach' is perplexing.  It opens with perhaps the finest quartet of songs Neil has ever produced, save the tracks that make up 'Rust Never Sleeps'.  Not only are these first tracks stellar compositions, but each one hits you from a completely different angle.  The disc opens with the vibrant, off-handed 'Walk On', with a chorus of \\"some get stoned, some get strange, but sooner or later it all gets real\\" announcing a divorce within the ranks of CSN&Y.  One of Young's most underrated compositions follows, the absolutely captivating 'See the Sky About To Rain' with Neil performing on, of all things, a Wurlitzer piano, with harp accompaniment.  The lyrics are nuanced and thoughtful, and flow perfectly within the melody.  We then skip abruptly to 'Revolution Blues' (which, along with 'Ambulance Blues' and 'On the Beach' registered as staples on the '74 tour), a rough edged, gripping ode to Charles Manson, with Young sounding more like his muse, Bob Dylan, than ever before or since.  This sterling quartet winds up with 'For the Turnstiles', a highly likable country-blues track finding Young on banjo along with Ben Keith on dobro.  Young's vocals are a \\"throw-back\\" to his broken-voice style found on 'Tonight's the Night' (which was recorded before, but released after, 'On the Beach', in 1975). <br /> <br />On the original vinyl release, side one ended with 'Vampire Blues', a decent slow-blues number, but not a radical piece of art like the sonic treasures that had preceded it.  For first time listeners, the diminished quality of 'Vampire Blues' would signal the worse: side two consisted of three of Young's most undistinguishable works.  While none of these songs is a loser, there is a whole lot of darkness and depression going on, and each song makes you increasingly numb and weary.  'On the Beach' features some nice lead guitar and really is the best song in the bunch, and could be better appreciated were it not surrounded by so many similar sounding tracks.  The weakest track is 'Motion Pictures', dedicated to Young's former wife, Carrie Snodgress, whom Neil spent much of the decade pining over. <br /> <br />The liner notes aren't extensive, but the players are detailed, and Young has surprises lined up on nearly every one.  'Revolution Blues' features former Band members Rick Danko and Levon Helm, while David Crosby lends a rhythm guitar.  Graham Nash is behind a Wurlitzer piano on 'On the Beach'.  On seperate tracks Joe Yankee is adding an electric tambourine and a harp.  Young regulars such as Ralph Molina, Tim Drummond and Billy Talbot are also prominently featured.   <br /> <br />Given the quality of the first four numbers, this disc goes beyond being essential only for fans of Neil Young.  It exists as an essential componant of any comprehensive rock music collection.

(Baby one more time, and Oops full with Bubblegum pop, In the zone full of club mixes). this one kind of combines both of those elements (and a slight dose of rock) into it.  <BR>Britney's definatly best cd :)  pick up this one, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and then you'll be set.  Don't bother with the other ones, the good songs on them are on the gretest hits album.  there's a few other good songs that don't appear on it, but for the most part they aren't that good.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|Following the three-hit 1982 debut,KISSING TO BE CLEVER,Culture Club scores more hits with this album. When this album was released in the fall of 1983,CC's Epic Records labelmate Michael Jackson was enjoying the abundant success of his THRILLER album. This album didn't win seven or eight Grammys like THRILLER though. KARMA CHAMELEON was the biggest hit of all. It was on the pop charts for about 20 or 25 weeks! The video,filmed on a ferryboat on the water,is great. Other hits include IT'S A MIRACLE,MISS ME BLIND and CHURCH OF THE POISON MIND,which was the very first. Virgin bought the rights to this album several years ago,and all other CC Epic releases. Like KTBC,this album was recently re-released on Virgin in digitally remastered form with a few bonus tracks. The bonus tracks might have appeared on the original line-ups outside America. The first ten tracks appeared on the original US line-up,in the very same order as they appear on this disc.
B00004VVNB|4.0|I kept thinking that this must have come our around the time of Planet of the Apes; very similiar type of movie.<br />It starts of a bit slow as you don't care for the people much, but once Jenny Agutter comes into the movie, the chemistry between her and Michael York makes it an easy movie to watch.<br />It was filmed in 1976 .. quite sometime ago and some of the effects show it.  That said, some of the effects are quite good too.<br />It surprised me a bit, but I was really glad to have gotten this DVD and watch it (a couple times now).  It actually seems to have the effect -- on me at least -- to be a &quot;feel good&quot; movie.  Likeable leads, good colour etc, and worth a viewing.
0316172324|1.0|One anecdotal story after another with a weak conclusion (which was yet another anecdotal story) attempting to tie it all up left me flat. Here's my summary: All you need to know is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" well... unless you're an expert of some sort. In that case, you can trust your initial reaction, because you're probably right. Well... unless you've paid attention to the wrong things... in which case you are proabably wrong. So, Don't judge a book by its cover - ESPECIALLY THIS BOOK!! You will see it on the bestseller list and assume it is worth reading (as The Tipping Point arguably was) rather than a weak, seemingly rushed attempt to ride on the coattails of his earlier success.

It's pretty amazing to think that a couple of years previous he was releasing the gore-fest, The Thing.  <br /> <br />This alien being however is only interested in learning about our planet and maybe making it better. The deer scene is a classic, and the final image on screen before the fade out is marvelous. Karen Allen's expression sums up how many people feel after they see this fine film. A great movie? Bingo!  <br /> <br />Now we need a release with extras including Carpenter's commentary.
B00005JNRB|3.0|I went into this movie expecting a National Treausreque type of experience, an adventure movie woven into a well thought out and developed historical story.  What Sahara is, is an action/adventure movie with emphasis put on action.  Not much at all is put into developing the history/lore of the submarine they are hunting for except for a few references that only remind you why the characters are in Africa in the first place. <br /> <br />The actors do a good job, McConaughey does a good job and gives quite a show for the lady's (my date was impressed).  Cruz is totally out of place and acts terribly, but acting skills arent why she got the part.  As always Zahn is hilarious, he is way past the fear of being type casted but still manages to play his parts perfectly and always makes his characters enjoyable, no difference in Sahara, he is the perfect sidekick to the pretty boy. <br /> <br />Outside of the plane wind powered sand rider thing that Dirk  (McConaughey) builds the action is quite believable and done well.  Overall, I was disappointed in the movie because it was billed as National Treasure like movie, but was much more of an adventure movie where they are constantly narrowly escaping capture and/or death for the entire movie, and nothing more. <br /> <br />I would recommend it, just don't go expecting National Treasure.
B0007GAERG|2.0|When you release a project that announces your 'emancipation' and it's an album with only a few gems and a pretty large number of filler tracks -- don't expect many people to rejoice. <br /> <br />Filler as in the lifeless, generic R&B/Hip-Hop \\"It's Like That\\", which is the first single off 'Mimi'. Filler as in the lifeless, bland, boring songs that lyrically ache and feature the aide of rent-a-rappers who fail to make the song any more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Now, although The Voice has returned (thank God she stopped whispering/mumbling her songs), it seems that this little experiment of hers isn't receiving a positive reception from the majority of her fan base who have enjoyed the beautiful, stunning ballads that she's released. Heck, even the fans who have enjoyed the upbeat dance songs like \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Fantasy\\" aren't embracing this mediocre material. Mariah's more than capable of pumping out an album full of solid, stunning material -- but this album, just like her last 2 studio projects ('Glitter', 'Charmbracelet'), just leaves me disappointed. <br /> <br />The best song on this album would have to be the second single, \\"We Belong Together\\", which is presented as a continuation of the first single. This song's a ballad -- and of course, Mariah does what she does best when it comes to a stand-out love ballad -- make you feel it. The best part of this song is the final note she hits at the end of the song (talk about striking a nerve or two)! ..And you'd think with a song like this, she'd know better enough to realize that some of the other songs needed a little revision? ...Nah. <br /> <br />This album's pretty filler and is nothing that stands out like in her previous efforts 'Butterfly' and 'Daydream'. <br /> <br />This album is for you if: <br /> <br />- You like the mediocre R&B/Hip Hop filth being overplayed on radio <br />- You're not looking for Ballad Mariah <br />- You're not looking for Cool-Dance Mariah <br />- You can dance to boring, souless beats <br /> <br />The only other songs I'll actually give a listening to are \\"Circles\\" and \\"Mine Again\\". And since I'm not a fan of samey-sounding songs, boring beats, or over-emoting -- I just tend to skip the other songs. But if you really wanna hear a whiny Mariah, check out the international track \\"Sprung\\" .. it's Mariah's worst yet. <br /> <br /> <br />Long story short: This album's full of mediocre, dead-on-arrival material. Mariah's singing full-on again, but it isn't enough to make the album an overall enjoyable listen. She has yet to ditch the annoying rent-a-rappers and she has yet to pump out a nice string of amazing material. <br /> <br />Another disappointing album.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Queen Is Dead is the popular choice as The Smiths' masterpiece, and although hardcore fans such as myself could argue in favor of other albums, there is no denying that front to back, this album is their crowning moment and their greatest achievement.  Every song is perfect, from the opening attack of The Queen is Dead to the tear-jerking I Know It's Over.  The Smiths' greatest song (tied with How Soon Is Now), There is a Light That Never Goes Out, is simply amazing, and this album also contains three slices of perfection in the middle: The Boy With the Thorn In His Side, Cemetry Gates, and the jaw-dropping Bigmouth Strikes Again, perhaps their best single ever.  If you are new to The Smiths, get this album and work from here.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Slow at times, a little too long, but a great debut with four or five very strong songs.  This gives me hope for the future of music.  Standout track:  I am the Highway.
B000002L5P|4.0|This debut album from The Smiths, while excellent, is nowhere near the quality of their later albums.  This has nothing to do with the songwriting and everything to do with the production.  The album had already been recorded once using producer Troy Tate (and if you can find a copy of the bootleg Troy Tate Album, you'll be surprised at how much better it is than this).  The arrangements and production on this album were altered to the point of sanitizing the music a bit too much.  That being said, the songs are top-notch, especially Pretty Girls Make Graves, Suffer Little Children, Still Ill, What Difference Does it Make, Hand in Glove, etc.  While I wouldn't recommend this as your first Smiths CD to buy, it's definitely a great album and essential to your Smiths collection.
B000062TU1|5.0|From beginning to end, this movie holds onto our attention.  It delights us, it amazes us, and it even frightens us ... but as entertainment it satisfies us.<br /><br />There has been a lot of complaints from Christians that this movie is anti-religious because it glorifies sorcery and black magic.  I don't agree with that at all.  In fact, you can see some of the Christ story in Harry Potter ... his humble beginnings in a \\"muggle\\" family, his name being known before his arrival on the scene, the great destiny he is to fulfill, his battle with an evil spirit (that pierces him), and so on.  Plus, this Harry Potter story has done more to get kids to read than any other one thing has ever before done.  And it is fun ... Harry Potter is fun.<br /><br />But this movie's quality is very high.  From the script, to the casting, to the directing and acting and special effects ... it gets A+ all around.<br /><br />I love the imaginative little things that were added here and there to fill out the story ... the sorting hat, the shifting staircases, the live paintings and newspaper photos, the cloak of invisibility, the goblins and the bank, and the wand shop and it's proprietor (which is my favorite) ... all of these things are there for us to delight in.<br /><br />But this is an excellent movie ... one that appeals to children and adults alike ... a classic tale of good versus evil that is interesting, involving, and most of all ... fun.
B000003TBP|5.0|When this album came out in 1994 it was groundbreaking in its merging of rock and electronic epherema.  While it has been overrated and blown out of proportion in the last 10 years, this is indeed a great album and probably Beck's crowning moment.  The opening salve of Devil's Haircut, Hot Wax, and Lord Only Knows stand along with Beck's masterpiece on this album, Where It's At, and go with his punkier numbers like High Five, the odd Derelict, Ramshackle, and Novocaine.  From front to back this is just a great album and one that should be your starting point if you're just getting into Beck.
6303407188|5.0|Midnight Cowboy, Born on the 4th of July, and... Ed Wood. Yes, these are my top 3 movies of all time, and Ed Wood had to be pretty awesome movie to get up there. <br />It's easier for a movie to be depressing. It's the simpler route to striking an emotional chord among audience members. If something is indescribably sad, then you can't poke fun of it. You can't laugh about it-- people DIED, dammit! And Ed Wood is one of the rare, non-depressing, actually inspirational great movies. It is uplifting- it shows how an opus (Plan 9 from outer space) can be created just out of ambition and self-confidence and determination. It shows the success that sprouts from self-acceptance. And the film is about the so-called worst director of all time! And he died of alcoholism-related things in the seventies! And yet Ed Wood still manages to be an inspiration! <br />So it's easy to call a happy movie cliche. Especially a happy movie with an old-fashioned directorial style (like the scene about Dolores' angora sweaters- she says something about them and he turns over to the camera with a guilty look on his countenance). But it has deep themes of friendship and it really questions society itself. The people in the movie- the freaks and outcasts- were rejected by society and then demonstrate their spark and vitality in the little movie world Ed makes. <br />So to conclude, it's funny, it's sad (but not overly so, almost in a textbook-like sense is it sad. What I mean by that is it shows the facts, but it doesn't dwell on them) and it's inspirational. Plus Johnny Depp is hot.
B00006F7S4|5.0|A lot of Beck's fans don't consider his album Mutations to be a \\"real\\" Beck album simplu because it's acoustic, folk-influenced songs came hot on the heels of 1994's Odelay!.  However, it was a \\"real\\" Beck album, and its sequel, if you will, came in 2002, hot on the heels of Midnite Vultures.  However, where Mutations was jaunty and generally a happy record, Sea Change is melancholy, sad, lonely, and beautiful.  The ache heard in the music on such songs as Already Dead, Lonesome Tears, and The Golden Age go against some more accepting songs of disappointment such as Guess I'm Doing Fine and Lost Cause.  Overall, this is an album that gives me chills every time I listen to it and it should for you, too.
B000059T1V|4.0|According to the liner notes from this one, Muddy had a tough time with Blues festivals. First he was too electric and loud. The next year he was too acoustic and quiet. From the sound of this one, he finally got it just right. <br /> <br /> This is not a barn-burner. Oh, it has plenty of energy, but if you're looking for the jolt found on his Blue Sky-era recordings, you're going to be a bit disappointed. This is smoother blues. Not mellow, but not as rowdy. Remember, the younger Muddy Waters was trying to find wide-acceptance of his misic. (It is a shame he didn't find that until the last few years of his life) <br /> <br /> The song selection is fantastic. \\"Tiger in your tank\\" is fun. \\"Got my mojo working\\" is a foot-stopmper. But, my favorite is \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\", which was allegedly penned on the stairs to the stage and ad-libbed by the band. But, what a band to have ad-lib! <br /> <br /> This one is must for those who want to move beyond blues/rock.
B000002LCX|5.0|While the popular consensus is that The Queen Is Dead was their masterpiece, I tend to find Strangeways their finest studio achievement, which unfortunately was followed by the breakup of the band after the recording was complete (but before the album was released).  How daring is it that the opening number, the great A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours, contains not one bit of guitar?  Or the overlooked masterpiece Death of a Disco Dancer, where the band fires on all cylinders and Morrissey delivers some of his wryest and best lyrics to date?  Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before is awesome, and if Last Night I Dreamed That Somebody Loved Me doesn't tug at your heart, from the eerie intro to the pleading performances from all 4 band members, then something is wrong with you.  Bitterness and sadness drip from Unhappy Birthday, which is often overlooked in The Smiths' canon of work.  Even the final track, I won't share you, which is simply Marr on autoharp and Morrissey singing with a little bass from Rourke, is pure perfection.  As is the album (with the exception of one song, the lame Death At One's Elbow).
B00008PW2D|1.0|I got this as a package of all 5 seasons.  I was eagerly anticipating this one and WOW, what a disappointment.  First, it was so apparent that Sarah Jessica Parker was pregnant and it made all the sex-related scenes seem totally unbelievable.  Also unbelievable were the huge tent-like outfits she wore that were supposed to stylish.  This season made me feel sorry for the characters on the show because they are portrayed as dried out old scags.  It wasn't nearly as funny or entertaining as the other four seasons.  RENT this one instead if you want to be a completist.
B000002L7J|5.0|The Smiths' second proper album, Meat is Murder, is *almost* up there in near perfeciton with The Queen is Dead, and it's so close as to be almost useless to say it isn't.  Here, Marr and Morrissey really hit their stride, penning amazing songs that are now thankfully backed up by good production.  The Smiths' arguably never had an opening track as immediate and great as The Headmaster Ritual, with its chiming guitars and amazing bass lines (an overlooked facet of The Smiths' sound throughout their career).  Nearly every song on here is perfect...the beefed up metallic What She Said, the wry Nowhere Fast, the achingly beautiful That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore, and the haunting closer Meat is Murder (I eat meat and the lyrics are preachy for Morrissey, but the music is great).  The US version includes the non-LP single How Soon Is Now, which, along with There is a Light That Never Goes Out and Bigmouth Strikes Again, is among the Smiths' finest moments.  As is this album.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre did it again with 2001. I just can't wait for that Detox album!!!! This album includes Forgot About Dre (feat. Eminem), and the Snoop Dogg-featured hit singles, Still D.R.E. and the Next Episode. Every song was hot, though Dre did not appear on all songs. I also liked \\"What's The Difference\\", which featured Xzibit and Eminem. Album also includes appearances by Nate Dogg, Devin The Dude and Knoc-Turnal. \\"Some L.A. S**t\\" is also a classic track with all the hottest West Coast artists and should have a part 2 on Detox featuring Ice Cube, The Game, and any other Compton artists who do it big until then. This is definitely a must-buy! Also buy \\"The Documentary\\" by The Game
B000002LFL|4.0|While live Smiths was usually awesome to listen to, this album, recorded during the end of the last tour the Smiths ever undertook, while good, isn't essential except to diehard Smiths fans.  The performances are good and interesting, but it's not their most inspired performance, although it was one of the better ones from the end of the tour.  However, I read somewhere that the band initially wanted it released as a 2CD set to include the whole concert, while Morrissey crypitcally refused and instead compiled this 1CD set that was released.  Knowing Morrissey, I guess we'll never know why he did that, as the complete show would have been a treat.
B00006BTCA|4.0|This is an album that works as a whole.  Each song flows into the next song, giving it a life and vitality that I feel would be absent if the songs were seperated and isolated from the ones around them.  Indeed, no song feels complete on its own.  That isn't to say I don't enjoy particular songs: I love the guitar sounds and flow of \\"Untitled\\" and \\"Obstacle 1\\" has some really great melodies.  But, to me, it is still an album to sit back and enjoy from beginning to end.  There are songs that I enjoy, but the experience of listening to the album as a whole is so good that I rarely pick and choose particular songs to visit.  That is what makes this album special.  It is a mood record.  Put it on while driving at night or as background music by which to read.  Enjoy it as a whole and embrace the mood that it exudes.
B000002MIF|5.0|While this was the second record released by The Smiths, it wasn't a proper album, rather a collection of BBC sessions and singles.  That being said, it's fantastic and certainly better than their first album.  The singles are great, as was always the case with The Smiths: How Soon Is Now, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, Girl Afraid, Hand in Glove.  But the BBC sessions offer a different sound for much of the material that was written and recorded around the time of their first album.  Most of these versions are superior to the studio counterparts, especially Accept Yourself, This Night Has Opened My Eyes, Handsome Devil, and What Different Does it Make?.  Essential Smiths for any fan.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona apple is a very cool mystique presence.her voice is like a dark angel humming.She is depressed and boy does she have reasoning too.Her rape, numerous therapist visit plus her evry day normal angst!This cd is a platinum masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!
B000002LBH|5.0|Louder Than Bombs was a Smiths singles, b-sides, and non-album track compilation that was released right around the time they were breaking up.  Even though it's not a proper album, it is a fantastic record.  Songs like Half a Person, London, Sweet and Tender Hooligan, Shelia Take a Bow, Panic, Ask, Rubber Ring, You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby, and Asleep would have enhanced any of their albums had they been included.  The only song on this album to avoid at all costs is their dreadful cover of Golden Lights, which Morrissey butchered with some post-production touches without the other band member's knowledge.  Otherwise, this is indispensible.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|i got this album from my parents because i wanted it so bad. so when i got it i heard all the songs here. and i was pretty impressed with most of the songs since mariah carey's voice shines and her vocals is very good.

038073186X|5.0|I'm an avid reader - so I run through books by the bag full.  Every once in awhile in those bags --- is real treasure.  This is definetly one of those.  It's one of the few that will leave you wanting to re-read it. This book is not a typical thriller - instead it stands out from all the thrillers whose plots and characters all too often seem to be \\"same story, same characters, only the names have been chaged kind-of-book.\\".  Shutter Island isn't brain candy --- it a whole meal --- that will have you staying up too late to get to the amazing ending twist!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the first RHCP album that I bought and I quickly collected the rest as soon as possible. These days in music there is simply nothing like this band. Every song on the album sounds fresh, nothing at all is repetitive. RHCP also can apeal to the mainstream too but earn respect simply because each band member is a outstanding musician and they've earned their spot by being in the underground for nearly a decade. On Frusciante's return he doesn't pick up where he left off but creates a new sound on each track. Most people know \\"Otherside\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" but there's a lot to enjoy. Frusciante's innovative guitar and song crafting make the engine run but Flea's sometimes melodic sometimes unrelenting bass play combined with Chad Smith's under rated drumming and Anthony Kiedis evolving voice and writing make this one of the greatest albums of all time.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell has put into print what all humans instinctively know, but often avoid acknowledging...we are animals relying on intrinsic knowledge that is hardwired into our brains. He further explains the consequences of the snap judgements we make...intrigiung read.
B0000C1733|5.0|Of course when you put together a collection of all the biggest hits of RHCP it's going to be great. But, buy every album, even if you are just an average fan you'll find at least a song or two on each album that you've never heard that you just can't stop listening to. The Greatest Hits automatically gets 5 stars because it has \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" on it which actually isn't on any of their albums.
B0002OERI0|3.0|The new Green Day album did not meet my expectations. I don't know if it met yours. It was less \\"punk\\" then their other albums. The two songs that make this album stand out are American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Jesus of Suburbia is funny at some parts but others it is so boring and too long. I was hoping for a much harder and faster album than this one.
B000067CPX|5.0|You absolutely don't have to be a long time RHCP fan to like this album. From beginning to end this album sounds like the Beach Boys later albums but mixed with a little alternative funk. There's just so much going on with the music, it's hard to notice the background vocals because they fit in so perfectly.The song crafting by John Frusciante shows why he is so highly regarded as a solo artist.  <br />They show that they can tackle any kind of music on this one. \\"By the Way\\" mixes the bands past with the present. \\"Dosed\\" has a chorus that sneaks up on you and is hard to stop listening to. \\"Can't Stop\\" has one the best intro riffs I've ever heard. \\"Zephyr Song\\" pulls away from some of the darker feeling songs on the album that set great moods. <br />So even if you've only heard one of the song's from this album on the radio or from a friend absolutely make sure that you buy it, you won't be able to stop listening to it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is fantastic,  please ignore the Madonna fans who have taken it upon themselves to give \\"Mimi\\" a scathing review! <br />(As stated in a particular internet forum) <br /> <br />Everything about it is pure gold. <br />I Bought this album when it first came out on Monday. So far it is now on a continuous loop. I listen to it all day and it gets better and better. Out off all her albums this ranks up there with \\"Daydream\\" and \\"Butterfly\\". Musically it is very retro, very old school and Mariah going back to her soul roots but brought right bang up to date to give that urban feel. You can hear the influences of Jackson 5, Motown, Patti La Belle, Gladys Knight et al. The real focus is her voice....it's back in full form. From whispering voice, mid range belting voice and whisle register she does it all and the songs really bring out the best in her amazing vocal range. <br /> <br />Every song is fantastic and for the first time you really don't want to skip a track like you do with most albums and that is the sign of a sure hit album!. Go out an buy it, it is a classic and lets all hope it brings a Grammy next Feb.  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - 10/10 <br />2. We Belong Together - 10/10 <br />3. Shake It Off - 6/10 <br />4. Mine Again - 10/10 <br />5. Say Somethin' - 7/10 <br />6. Stay The Night - 8/10 <br />7. Get Your Number - 7/10 <br />8. One And Only - 5/10 <br />9. Circles  - 7/10 <br />10.

B000002LQR|5.0|This is the pinnacle of RHCP's hard rocking style. On Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik they show how to rock without playing a bunch of barre chords over and over again. \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Give it Away\\", \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\" and others sound like nothing yet recorded. Guitar rock mixed with funk. This album is when RHCP starts their evolution to what their doing now too. \\"Under the Bridge\\" is simply one of the best song's ever written and recorded. \\"I Could of Lied\\", is quiet yet Frusciante rips out one of the best solo's I've ever heard. \\"Breaking the Girl\\" has a melodic sound thats a surprise when a band like this pulls it off. <br />Whether you like loud rock, melodic rock or just plain rock this album is a must buy.
B0007OASII|5.0|Power-metal is metal's version of punk rock.  Countless bands spawn every year, most from Germany but all with the same sound: fast double-bass drums, razor sharp harmonized guitars, a powerful vocalist and numerous references to fantasy.  In fact, it is almost impossible to find a power-metal band that does not take a medieval or fantastic setting as the physical space for their music, a decision that has attracted ridicule since the genre's beginnings.  Among the throngs of Sonata Artica's, Edguy's and Hammerfall's, it is difficult to find a genuinely innovative band.<br /><br />Lucky for us, there's Kamelot.<br /><br />On their seventh album, \\"The Black Halo\\", the American power-metal ensemble further develops the regal and majestic sound they perfected with their last release, 2003's \\"Epica\\", which took Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust as its inspiration.  Although the typical power-metal staples are still there, the sounds are much more diverse this time around.  Fast, energetic and melodically predictable pieces such as \\"When the Lights Are Down\\" and \\"Soul Society\\" keep the band anchored to the comfortable sounds of what we've come to expect.  The Rodenberg Symphony Orchestra continues the Kamelot tradition of layering songs with a sophisticated sound ranging from strings, violins and even horns.  Softer ballads like \\"The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)\\" and \\"Abandoned\\" grace the album with pianos, string quartets and female choirs, providing a striking contrast.  But this is nothing new.  Earlier songs like \\"A Sailorman's Hymn\\" and \\"Don't You Cry\\" flaunted the band's softer side in earlier albums.<br /><br />Then there's the unexpected.<br /><br />Black-metal superstar Shagrath from Sweden's Dimmu Borgir makes a special appearance with his blasphemous, guttural pipes on \\"March of Mephisto\\", which holds the coveted spot as the album's first track.  Normally reserved for the faster numbers - in this case, \\"When the Lights Are Down\\" - the opening track is slower and more intense, much like a sinister parade.  It is a song unlike any other in the Kamelot catalog, whose inner workings echo \\"Master of Puppets\\"-era Metallica and earlier Dream Theater.  Singer Roy Khan doesn't hold back on this track or the album, unafraid to show off his impressive vocal range.  Guitarist Thomas Youngblood (whose name caters perfectly to the genre) is slightly restrained and subtle in his delivery, soloing only when needed and keeping the fast riffage to a minimum.  The song even has a cameo from power-metal veteran Jens Johansson, from Finland's Stratovarius.<br /><br />The album's centerpiece is the 9-minute \\"Memento Mori\\", a song that visits several genres and explores a number of movements, started by a melody that may remind listeners of Savatage.  The piece explores Middle-Eastern influenced melodies and medieval landscapes and still has time to bring Shagrath back for another resonating, sinister growl.  After the third and last interlude, we are given another gem, the catchy and delightful \\"Serenade\\", which is a perfect example of Kamelot taking the tired power-metal formula and using it to their advantage with a gifted ear.<br /><br />The theatrical elements are greater than they were on their past works.  The album's three short \\"interludes\\" are well-crafted with numerous sound effects - walking on snow, a person lighting a match, a distant church choir, people at a tavern - that unite the individual songs with a subtle narrative.  Even more impressive is the handful of references to \\"Epica\\", namely in the form of a familiar melody or the incorporation of a subtly changed lyric.<br /><br />For all its epic thematic and musical scope, the album is not without its flaws.  The power-metal genre has little creative elbow-room, and even Kamelot eventually falls into the trap of becoming forgettable.  Songs such as the plain \\"This Pain\\" and the unchanging \\"Nothing Ever Dies\\" lull for far too long without becoming a standout track.  Even thetitle-track lacks an outstanding melody or chorus to drive it.  Sadly, in their particular genre, this tendency is almost inevitable.<br /><br />But of course, these flaws are only applicable if you're a power-metal connoisseur.  Otherwise, \\"The Black Halo\\" is an amazing creation.  The few lackluster tracks make it a slight step down from \\"Epica\\", but not by much.  The tremendous diversity with which the album flows, along with the grand orchestral sounds that accompany the rich guitar-work, make the album soar.  It is a must-have for any enthusiast of the genre, and a necessary introduction for those unfamiliar.<br /><br />See also: Kamelot - \\"Epica\\", Kamelot - \\"The Fourth Legacy\\"t track.

B00005MCX3|5.0|I first bought this album when I hosted \\"The Mellow Sounds\\" (an all-metal program) on KXLU-FM (88.9 in LA) in the mid-70s.  While there are more than a few records I have trashed since then, Hawkwind still does it for me, and I'm sure other Friends of Jef&trade;.  They were unique then, they still are 30 years later.  Got to love that Mellotron! Great tunes to \\"space out\\" to.  I've long since copied my vinyl to MP3 and was playing it at work.  All these young pups are going \\"wow - great music. Who is it?\\". <br />If you're new to Hawkwind, as other reviewers have said, you just can't go wrong with Hall of the Mountain Grill! It kicks!  Long live Beenzon Toste!
B000683VI4|2.0|This movie is easily forgotten. I suppose the hype is what really made me eat into this movie orginally- all my friends told me that I'd love it-since I'm a fan of chick flicks and sobby movies. I expected a lot from the movie based on the reviews from the newspapers and online but, was disappointed. This review certainly won't win me any popularity votes but, this movie will be easily forgotten and is possibley the worst movie of the year.<br /><br />The story is in some sort a cliche- an impossible love the girls rich(Allie) and has everything in life, while the boy(Noah) dosn't have a dime to rub together. Of course, the parents object despite the fact the kids are crazy about eachother. And of course when, they both can finally be together Allie is engaged to a rich Southern man her parents approve of. In the end of course Allie chose Noah over Lon and they live happily ever after.I found myself predicting everything in this movie and find it boring to watch. It's definately a movie I would NOT rent on girls night. While, it was cute to see Allie and Noah as an older couple it kind of ruined the whole mystery that was in the book. This movie might have kept my interest if I had been guessing or didn't know who Allie chose. And the soppish Titanic dying in bed ending also made the movie seem to sop driven instead of emotional when, it should have ended with Old Noah looking at the notebook with the words \\"Read this and I'll come back to you.\\"<br /><br />Although some good performances emerge from the younger actors- both who I hope to see in more films. Rachel McAdams especially did a good job her face seemed to fit the period really well. The older actors seem sedated throughout this movie and both surprisly are out-shined by their young co-stars. Nick Cassavetes was the wrong choice for director of the love flick- he directed JohnQ also one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And it's no wonder his sensitive love debut failed.<br /><br />I suppose given the rating it has recieved on Amazon.com some people were bound to like this film but, personally even as a sob- and soppy love stories fan I found this movie tragically boring. All in all I recommend you look for another chick flick for girls night because, this one is easily forgotten.he rating it has recieved on Amazon.com some people were bound to like this film but, personally even as a sob- and soppy love stories fan I found this movie tragically boring.

B00007KWHP|3.0|I only own this Yes album, and I do like it.  But i think that other than the four main songs such as \\"roundabout\\" and \\"south side of the sky,\\" this album suffers from the trite little song contributions of each member.  For instance, \\"we have heaven\\" utterly disgusted me and almost made me gag when I heard the singers incredibly annoying voice.  To this day it remains the worst song I have ever heard, and turns me off from listening to this band further.  But \\"roundabout\\" is a very strong song, why didn't they write more songs like this, instead of the overall weak and dumb \\"cans and brahms,\\" within which idiot keybored noises abound?  This band has always dragged itself down with the dead weight of classical artiness and composition, and it is really annoying to a fan of progressive artists like King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Rush, and Peter Gabriel.  If you have limited patience for artiness, save yourself the trouble and buy Moving Pictures by Rush.  That album is a much better prog-rock album than this one.  But if you must have an album by Yes, get this one.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I'm a avid fan of QOTSA and I've owned this album for a couple days now and from what I can tell so far, this album is definitely weirder than the others. While songs in other albums are usually topical and to the point, songs on this album are more lucid and detached. Almost dreamy. Of course, QOTSA sticks to the genre like a true worshipper of rock n' roll with songs usually covering Sex (love), drugs and death. Its true the bassist left prior to this album coming out and I think his departure had inspired a few songs on this album. Messages of goodbye and shame are in \\"Everyone knows that you're insane\\", \\"In my head\\", \\"Tangled up in plaid,\\" and \\"I never came\\" to just name a few. Songs that are more lucid and the singing of Josh Homme seems detached as if whispering coming from somewhere and to reflect enlightened observations in a comforting tone like \\"Someone's in the wolf\\" and \\"Blood is love\\". Musically this album seems more limited, while guitars don't really play a huge part in creating a song for QOTSA, usually that is left up to the bass and drums while guitars add to the ambient texture in a song. While there's some fun rock songs on this album, the weirdo downer, spacehead, songs on this album seem to bring them down. I don't know if this new direction is in response to their bassist leaving but its mostly likely. I gave it a 3 because I don't like the new direction they're going. Check out any album prior to this to see their fun rock side in its perfection.
B000002H33|5.0|How can I say more than what has already been said?  I am 35 years old.  When this album came out we were all Metallica fans already, yet this just took it to the next level.  Why bother reviewing each song, the whole album was and still is mind blowing.  In fact it is amazing how powerful and impressive it still is after 18 years!  If you are just discovering Metallica, stick with the first five albums, if you can only afford one, make it this one.  For what its worth Master of Puppets and Slayer's Reign In Blood will stand the testament of time as the two greatest heavy metal albums of all time.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|In the early nineties, one of my pre-school daughter's favorite videos was something entitled WARRIORS OF THE WIND.  As an adult, I found much in it to be of interest, and much of the animation to be of an exceedingly high quality, but overall the film lacked balance and a cohesive structure to make it a truly great animated film. Later I learned that the animator/writer/director Hiyao Miyazaki had been horrified with the way his Japanese original had been transferred into English and that many of the ecological concerns of the film had been muted by aggressive editing on the part of the American distributors.  During the past two decades the English-language revision of NAUSICAA AND THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, the film which through reediting became WARRIORS OF THE WIND has generated as much anger as any film ever made.  Now, however, arguably the greatest injustice in the history of animation has been redressed with a marvelous new edition of what is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest achievements.<br /><br />There is a lot of debate about where NAUSICAA AND THE VALLEY OF THE WIND stands among all of Miyazaki's films  Even while there has been a growing consensus that Miyazaki is the greatest maker of feature length animated film ever, there is controversy as to whether this film is or is not his greatest film.  I'll confess my bias that it is his finest film, though I certainly can understand why someone would defend the assertion that THE PRINCESS MONONOKE or SPIRITED AWAY deserves that designation.  Both of those films are a bit more polished and even more lavishly and elaborately drawn.  My own reasons for preferring NAUSICAA are several.  First, I personally believe that NAUSICAA is the first truly great Miyazaki film.  Although he had done many superb films before this one, it was at this point that his art reached an apex that he has matched on other occasions, but never unquestionably surpassed.  Second, I loved the story, both the scope of Miyazaki's vision, the cohesiveness of his narrative, and the richness of the moral message underlying the film.  Finally, the animation of the film just blew me away even in the bowdlerized version of the film, and does so even more in this fully restored version.  Miyazaki pioneered in animation the framing of images in cinematic fashion.  For instance, Miyazaki manipulates in scenes in which Nausicaa flies her glider beside a larger ship to be from the same point of view a camera would be if it were a live action scene.  His perspective is always driven by an imaginary camera, unlike, say, the Disney films, in none of whose films from the forties to the eighties can be found a similar manipulation of perspective.  Several Disney films from the late eighties to the present display such perspective at times, but I would suggest that it is not an accident that these were made after Miyazaki had perfected the technique in a number of films.  Perhaps Miyazaki has made minor improvements in his films since NAUSICAA, but none represent the quantum leap forward that this one did.<br /><br />One reason my daughter watched and rewatched WARRIORS OF THE WIND, until she literally wore out the video, was the lead character.  If my memory serves me correctly, they changed the central character's name from Nausicaa to some far blander name, a change that is emblematic for the production as a whole.  But even in that version, Nausicaa stood out as not merely one of the most compelling heroines in animated film, but in all films.  In fact, even today Nausicaa compares favorably with such characters as Ripley from the ALIEN films and Buffy Summers as a compelling heroine.  She is at moments subject to the kind of preciousness that mars many moments in anime in particular and Asian film in general (think of key moments in films when Jackie Chan ceases his chase of the villains to save a baby in danger, or the way in this one where Nausicaa cuddles with the half cat/half fox creature that attaches itself to her), but all in all, she is utterly courageous, amazingly inventive, unstintingly moral and compassionate, fiercely uncompromising in her principles, and unfailingly resourceful.  In scene after scene after scene, Miyazaki invents new and strangely believable ways for his diminutive heroine to resolve seemingly impossible crises.  By the end of the film, one has as much confidence in Nausicaa to save the day as Superman or Batman or Indiana Jones.  As the father of a girl I can't express how important it was to her when she was young to have such a female heroine to enjoy.  Male or female, heroic characters do not come any better than Nausicaa.<br /><br />No review of this film would be complete without adding some praise for the score.  Although I had a tad bit of trouble with the childlike voice that intentionally intones lyrics slightly off key (Sarah Vaughan would famously sing out of tune when she would sing the Ira Gershwin line \\"The way you sing off key,\\" but she even sang off key musically in a way that enhanced the song as a whole) to produce a decidedly irritating effect, the score as a whole is amazingly effective.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about the entire series of new issues of the entire Miyazaki catalog is that they consistently provide both the original which can be watched with subtitles and an extremely high quality dubbed version.  In live action films I am an unstinting purist.  I simply won't watch a dubbed version of a film with live actors, since one gains so much from hearing the actual voices of the actors.  I always get a kick on the X-FILES DVDs listening to the various foreign language dubbings and chuckling at the gap between, say, the voice of Gillian Anderson as Scully and the voice of the low-voiced actress dubbing her into German.  But with animation it is a different matter.  For one thing, the animated characters do not possess actual voices, but have only what any actor gives them.  Additionally, animation is even more than live action films driven by the images on the screen.  I find I always enjoy the visual aspect of the film more by not having to focus both on what is on the screen and on subtitles.  Luckily, one can with this DVD set do both, watch it first in the dubbed version and then in the subtitled, or vice versa.  I very much enjoyed the actors used to dub the English version.  There were some obligatory big names-Patrick Stewart, who is outstanding as Lord Yupa, Alison Lohman (who voiced Nausicaa), Uma Thurman, Edward James Olmos-but most of the people were highly appropriate for the character they were dubbing.<br /><br />My only complaint with the DVDs is the way that Disney programs the DVDs to try to steer you to an endless series of Disney commercials when the discs are first inserted.  Such spamming is just not appropriate to DVDs and especially not to an otherwise high quality version of a Miyazaki classic.  Still, I applaud Disney for taking the effort to make almost Miyazaki's entire incredibly impressive corpus available.  Only a few years ago, before the release of PRINCESS MONONOKE, Miyazaki was still unknown to most American filmgoers.  He still doesn't enjoy the reputation that he deserves, but the release of his films on DVD is treated as event even by Wal-Mart and Target.  He truly is without his peer in the world of feature length film animation, for not only does he do an amazing percentage of the animation himself, he also writes the stories, and acts as both producer and director.  No other great animator has involved himself in his films at such great length and in such detail.es itself to her), but all in all, she is utterly courageous, amazingly inventive, unstintingly moral and compassionate, fiercely uncompromising in her principles, and unfailingly resourceful.

B000002J1S|5.0|I own this album on vinyl and have it on tape as well. I just heard a cover of Back in NYC by Jeff Buckley from Sketches for my Sweetheart the Drunk. It reminded me of how great this album really is. I must own it on CD and so must you. No time for romantic escape...buy it now...
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is another BAD album by a good singer. She needs to get to together with good producers and make some real music. It's just another album of mariah trying to prove that she is black. It's BAD HORRIBLE TERRIBLE CRAP! I don't hate mariah i just think she can do so much better than this crap she puts out.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|With Vampires being a mythological character that many adore and admire, and many film versions of the Dracula story has come to be.  This film is not one of the top Dracula fims that has been made.  Were, we have a plotline that follows Van Helsing going around the world trying to save it from all kind of beasts and demons for the catholic church.  However,  the movie does a poor job on portraying the character Van Helsing as a heroic character and as a savoir of humanity.  The character of Dracula is spinned off into a new direction of coming to be a vampire, its not from hatred of the catholic church because of a lost love as in the book.  But is made a vampire because he made a deal with the devil for immortality as long as he serves the devil on earth.  Which is not to enticing of a character storyline but still ties into the movie in general.   <br />      <br />           Kate Beckinsale does a horrible job with her eastern europe accent but still manages to make a decent attempt at acting as the movie love interest/co-hero of Van Helsing.   <br />       <br />           Furthermore, this movie is driven by the special effects that so many big budget movies are.  Which in turn, like so many before it,  lack a true plotline.  Where the characters are bound to the typical actions of a hero storyline.  Although there are a some well timed humor and decent acting from the main characters, that make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.   <br /> <br />              The Special Effects in of themselves are actually really good.  With amazing footage and computer generated scenes makes the movie into a great spectical.  It does capture the goth life style that was prominate during that time period and setting the mood for each scene.  For that this movie gets an A-minus.  <br /> <br />     The Directing of this movie was well thought out and done beautifully but could not save this film enough to make it a classic film or even a good film.   Although it is an entertaining movie to say the least.  A good movie to rent when you and your friends want to sit down and have a movie marathon.
0679731725|5.0|To be a positive contributor to society and the important issues that flow within it, is something, for the most part, that people yearn to be. They want to offer the best of themselves-their talents, their expertise, their prowess (in whatever field)-and in a small or big way, be acknowledged for it. It is a stark truth in all professions, to the highly important to the extremely entry-level. Besides monetary necessity for the reasons why we work, acknowledgement ranks right up there, if not number one on the list. And it is true for the protagonist, Stevens, in Kazuo Ishiguro's elegantly yet restrained or repressed English novel, The Remains of the Day.  <br /> <br />Set in England in the 1950s while on a contemplative road trip, the story revolves around Stevens, the ultimate prim and proper, sometimes unyielding \\"perfect\\" English butler who prides himself on his sterling service on behalf of his English lord, Lord Darlington of Darlington Hall. While on his jaunt throughout the rolling green English countryside, Stevens ruminates through a series of chapter-by-chapter flashbacks, the genuine \\"greatness\\" of the man whom he served, a refined English lord of olden times but also a bumbling political neophyte of the worst sort who goes way over his head regarding Hitler and the Nazi way of \\"doing things\\". Constantly ingnoring the nagging truth that is in his heart and mind, he delves deeper within himself and presents a formal if not icy, robotic mask of civility, propriety and polite reservedness. While the outer image that he presents is one of a fine old fellow, the inner turmoil and realization of the dark dynamic of Lord Darlington-via the various dialogues with Miss Kenton (the head house mistress)-gradually fleshes itself out to where it is no longer a rumor or speculation but a horrifying truth. And how does Stevens fit into that wider picture of Lord Darlington's inhuman actions--guilt by association or something darker and worse? Did he himself evolve intoa temporary drone or puppet and turn a blind eye upon fanatical anti-semitism? <br /> <br />The Remains of the Day is a very quite book with beautiful, elegant prose; it is very much an English novel that eloquently addresses many contemporay issues besides religious discrimination. However, it is percisely its quietude that makes the blarring horror of Lord Darlington's anti-semitism so disturbing and in-your-face. And Stevens, whose blind allegiance is firmly fixed, no matter what, one-ups Lord Darlington-if that is possible-and boldly poses the question to the reader: Were I to witness a manifestitation of evil, and I knew it to be so, would I turn a blind eye or would I try to do something about it? The Remains of the Day is a compelling and beautifully crafted novel and appropriately imbued with dry English humor, lifting it in places so the book does not drip down like a wet, oppressive cloth of banal English preachments of right and wrong.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is simply a revolutionary album. Mariah gets back to her winning formula with Mimi. Her yin and yang method, with its schizophrenic mix of the '80s and 21st-century hip hop, works wonders for Emancipation. About her voice, the collection [The Emancipation Of Mimi] of songs rightfully places her voice front and center. It is as if Carey is returning to the place that put her on the map. <br />
078401213X|4.0|Whether one likes the film, PI, or not, one will simply not forget it.<br /><br />A super math geek, Max Cohen, finding patterns in everything, looks to use math to figure out the stock market. In the process, he is confronted by Wall Street people and Kabbalists who look to take advantage of his genius for their own purposes.<br /><br />Whether the universe is governed by pattern or chaos, is what drives the film. Max is symbolic of this, in that he is seeking order, while heading on a path to pure personal chaos, insanity.<br /><br />The film weaves interesting black and white cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, and an excellent acting performance by Sean Gullette as Max, into a film which does make a viewer at least contemplate some pretty important things.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Blown away I was at first listen. The Emancipation of Mimi took this already Mariah Carey fan to a new level. Yes, That's right, I never expected to hear a new CD by Mariah sound this hot. You can tell she's more confident, you can tell she took her time getting it right with this one...I smell some serious recognition for this work (and the Grammy goes to...), maybe a few number one songs as well. Keep shining Mariah, you sparkle so bright!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|this album is hot!!! its got classic mariah style with a bit of new. my favorite tracks are \\"shake it off\\" and \\"joy ride\\". this is an album worth buying.
B0000020T3|5.0|I find the seeming obscurity of this album difficult to understand based upon the strength of the title track alone, which is - to put it mildly - brilliant.  Shake Some Action (the song) is a pulse-pounding power-pop / proto-punk anthem in the grandest sense; the rest of the album, however, is a bit of a curious anachronism.  The Groovies find themselves shying away from the grittier, more raw (often almost sleazy) Stones-esque sound they created on Teenage Head in favor of a more melodic 'Beatles circa 1966' sound - but in 1976!  Put side by side with original British Invasion era hits, these songs stand up for themselves, unfortunately they were released ten years too late (and, as such, found primarily only a cult following).  One could argue, however, that these songs too were ahead of their time (for everything, particularly musicals fads, work in cycles).  Was it not the music of the British Invasion 9as well as American Garage) that was the primary influence on the then burgeoning (in 1976 that is) punk movement?  And it would be only a few more years hence that power-pop would make its greatest maks on the music charts with the likes of The Romantics, The Knack, and others doing what The Flamin' Groovies had already done to perfection.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I am one of those Mariah fans that has all her albums yet sometimes wonders why I still like her. This album was a reminder. I must say, I was going to buy it no matter what but for me to be so pleased as to write a review is a very rare thing. Sure, there were good songs on Glitter and Charmbracelet. But nothing really memorable like what we see here. I only wish there was a little more personal material here- as it is the Emancipation of Mimi, but hey, its still a great CD. <br /> <br />Here are my ratings: <br /> <br />Its Like that- 4/5 really catchy, its growing on me fast <br /> <br />We belong together- 5/5- love this one- so sad that it makes    me want to cry <br /> <br />Shake it off- 4/5 <br /> <br />Mine Again- 5/5 <br /> <br />Say Something- 5/5 So catchy- really different and in a good way! <br /> <br />Stay the Night- 5/5 <br />Get Your Number- 5/5 One of the best songs- kind of amusing even <br /> <br />One and Only- 3/5- Not my favorite <br /> <br />Circles- 5/5- Really good; reminds me of old school Mariah <br /> <br />Your Girl- 4/5- It's OK but it drags a little <br /> <br />I wish you Knew- 4/5- Same as your girl, kind of slow <br /> <br />To the Floor- 5/5- I like the beat of this one and the concept- really creative and Mariah and Nelly have good chemistry together <br /> <br />Joy Ride- 3/5- Ok <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird- Beauiful and uplifting; One of the gems on the album <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|My God, this was great!  The DVD extras are brilliant!  I particularly liked the Hollywood location map where you click on the grid of the map and get a wonderful view as well as a historical perspective on important locations in the movie.  These locations include the Getty mansion, Norma Desmond's crib, and Schwab's Pharmacy where Lana Turner was supposedly discovered according to Hollywood myth.  Movie lovers will enjoy the short biography of costume mavin Edith head and movie composer Waxman.  These classy touches would have been enough, but the detail on the making of the film as well as the during-film optional commentary by Billy Wilder's biographer put the whole deal over the top.  Fall in love with Sunset Boulevard all over again.
B00070DK14|5.0|Finally, after many years of waiting, my favorite band has released the remastered B&B and I can complete my Jethro Tull collection! Now you might say \\"wait a tick, Broadsword and the Beast has been out on CD for years.\\" That's true, but the original CD release was nearly unlistenable, and certainly the weakest disc in the collection. It sounded a bit like it was recorded with a hand held microphone inside a wet felt sack - muddy and of inconsistent quality.<br /><br />This release is much superior to the original! Broadsword & the Beast was a moderate success in the United States, but in Germany and other European countries - this was \\"THE\\" Jethro Tull album to have, eclipsing Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and all the rest in sales and chart ranking. With perhaps the best artwork on any album cover, ever - this disc became quite popular and the menacing pixie like image of Ian still adorns concert tee shirts.<br /><br />While the tone of the album took the guise of Scandinavian or Celtic themes, this album was definitely a stinging commentary of contemporary times. Among the several notable songs on this collection, THE CLASP and FALLEN 0N HARD TIMES both got a respectable amount of radio play in 1982. Both songs referred to the troubled times in which we were living, both economically and politically. An ailing Leonid Brezhnev was the General Secretary of the still thriving Soviet Union, only to be replaced by an equally threatening Yuri Andropov later that year. Reagan and Thatcher had formed a powerful, yet decidedly unsettling alliance in the west. These were scary times folks, and Ian's lyrics reflected the uncertainty we were all feeling!<br /><br />Other great songs on the disc include BROADSWORD, a song that harkens back to ancient times, and speaks of protecting home and family from external threats. PUSSYWILLOW became a favorite on the touring scene for a while, though I haven't seen it performed in years. The last song on the original release was the peaceful, almost comforting CHEERIO, in which Ian and the lads wished us all \\"the best of luck till we meet again, mate.\\" This song has been used as the closer for almost every concert appearance since.<br /><br />I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful stage set used on this concert tour. This was the final bombastic, over the top stage presentation Tull would ever mount, and it was wonderful! The stage was a full blown Viking ship with the dragon masthead shown on the cover painting - complete with smoking nostrils and glowing eyes. Other memorable moments from the show included an actual \\"BEASTIE\\" sitting on Ian's shoulders as he sang that song, and a huge BROADSWORD he flailed about that had to be as tall as Ian himself. During WATCHING ME WATCHING YOU, the stage was completely dark while Ian scanned the audience, pointing a powerful hand held spotlight out to look at us watching him! It was a great show!<br /><br />I will wrap up with a mention of the bonus tracks, all of which have been available on other releases. These are a nice collection of songs all recorded around the time of this album. The most notable of these are JACK FROST AND THE HOODED CROW, a tune that most recently reappeared on the Christmas Album, and JACK A LYNN, a touching and lovely song Ian wrote in tribute to his wife Shona (it's her middle name.) MAYHEM MAYBE is a fun little ditty, and OVERHANG is a riffy, enjoyable piece as well. Enjoy this disc, it is a treasure!HEERIO, in which Ian and the lads wished us all \\"the best of luck till we meet again, mate.\\" This song has been used as the closer for almost every concert appearance since.

B000002HMH|2.0|Prior to \\"Load,\\" Metallica had created 5 of the biggest and best heavy metal albums of all time. They basically hit a wall with the release of the \\"black\\" album. Maturing into a new sound after creating the best selling metal album in history isn't the easiest task. It almost seems impossible to follow it up with something as revolutionary as it's predecessors.<br /><br />Here we see Metallica completely streamlining their sound, cutting out most of their whaling time signatures, and riveting solos. The album sounds too polished, and mainstream. Definitely not the Metallica everyone has grown to love. Adding the amount variety to the album that they did, makes them sound more conventional than ever before. The addition of southern rock, country-rock and power ballads turned them into a 70s arena rock quartet; something that they were out to destroy in their earlier days. They've really settled into this mid-tempo blues oriented feel, that I'm honestly not feeling. Although the playing is tight, the formula gets quite redundant over the the album's 80-minutes in length.<br /><br />I couldn't agree more, that Metallica needed to change their sound. They could only work the same riffs so many times. But unfortunately Metallica has become depressingly conservative with this release. Which is why this album was the disappointment of 1996 for so many Metallica fans. The album is still good, but within the scope of Metallica's revolutionary career, I can't give it more than 2 stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Truly an epic mini-series. When people say epic, it's generally semi-epic or hardly worthy of your full attention. But this movie, it grabs your attention. There is no escaping the passion, the fears and the courage that this movie emits through the brave tellings of the men of Easy Company. Men that are like our fathers, brothers, uncles, cousins and nephews. Men that have rose to the call of duty and have did some of the most heroic and extrodinary things in our time. Though watching this movie can only give a person a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day and the hell of trying to survive a war, it gives you the best glimpse possible. <br /> <br />This mini-series will go down in history as an amazing cinematic epic that will forever shake and rock the roots of war movie making. No movie, tv show or mini-series will ever rise above the amazing story and skill that created 'Band of Brothers'.
B000002H6C|5.0|It's beginning to feel like Metallica-by-numbers at this point. This will be the third time they've nearly copied the template from \\"Ride The Lightning\\". That doesn't make the album any worse. What does damper it's spirit a bit is the production value. The drums sound tinny, and the guitars buzz. Newsted's bass is nearly inaudible. Despite the production flaws, this set of songs has got to the most technical, complex and riveting instrumental arrangements Metallica has ever brought to the table.<br /><br />These songs are, on average, the longest they've ever composed. They weave through several time changes and complex time signatures, harmonized leads, and dense guitar work. The album's saving grace is \\"One,\\" an instant metal classic, and a top 40 hit on the charts. \\"One\\" single-handedly saves the momentum of the album.<br /><br />Although \\"...And Justice For All\\" is the most riveting album in Metallica's progressive years, the album still remains as sort of a flawed masterpiece. Do you ever notice how your ears hurt the most after listening to this album? It's definitely in need of a major overhaul in re-mastering. Nevertheless, the album still deserves 5 stars in the scope of heavy metal.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Warning: This review contains spoilers-plot details are revealed. On the other hand, the metaphysics of this melodrama is such that even when you know what happened in the movie you don't know what happened in the movie, so that's not really a problem.<br /><br /> The mystery of the story can be summed up with a simple question: \\"Who stabbed the samurai Takehiko Kanazawa?\\" The short story the movie is based on, Yabu no Naka (In a Grove) gives three versions of the rape of a woman and the death of her husband, one from each of the three participants: A samurai, his wife, and the bandit. The movie adds a fourth version told by a woodcutter who is not in the original story, whom I shall ignore for now and return to later.<br /><br /> I was actually a bit surprised by this movie, having heard many times of it as the story of competing realities, how different people can view the same events differently. I therefore expected I might see several disinterested witnesses recount different, but ultimately compatible, versions of the same event. Perhaps one witness saw the beginning, a second witness the end, and a third witnessed the entire event. Under those circumstances, different interpretations would certainly be possible. Or perhaps one witness could see something from his vantage point that others couldn't from theirs. On the contrary, the three versions are presented by the participants, who are certainly not disinterested, and naturally have motives to distort the truth. And the three versions are irreconcilable: if any one is telling the truth, the other two cannot be. Contrary to the suggestion that different realities might be at play, at least two of the three participants must be lying. For example, there is no mental distortion that would make a man who was stabbed in a long, violent sword fight think he had dejectedly stabbed himself after long lonely contemplation.<br /><br /> The story is a mystery with a strange twist. Each of the three participants confesses to the stabbing! So any solution to the mystery needs not only to explain why the culprit did it, but also why the other two innocents confessed to it.<br /><br /> In the movie, Kurosawa has told us which version he believes is true by creating the woodcutter, who is not in the original story. The woodcutter, once he admits stealing the woman's short sword - thus clearing up a minor mystery in the short story (who took the woman's sword?), has no apparent reason to lie. He then tells a tale that is essentially the tale as told by the bandit Tajomaru. They both agree the man was stabbed in a fair swordfight instigated by the woman after she was raped. Their stories differ only in some details Tajomaru left out. In the woodcutter's version, the two men are reluctant to fight, showing some fear of each other. The woman has to goad them both, questioning each his manhood, before the fight commences. Tajomaru would understandably want to conveniently omit this goading as evidence of his own fear. It is also to his benefit to omit the samurai's fearfulness, since the braver the opponent, the more noteworthy the victory. Tajomaru's version of the swordfight understandably omits the clumsiness and nervousness in the woodcutter's version, but a blow-by-blow description with no psychological speculation would be essentially identical. So the swordfight in Rashomon gives the only rashomonesque scenes in the film.<br /><br />  So if the bandit killed the samurai, why would the samurai say, in his message from the dead as transmitted by a medium, he'd killed himself? Probably for the sake of his name. He lost honor enough when he was tricked by the bandit, and failed to prevent the rape of his wife. To have then lost a swordfight when no trickery was involved would have also made him incompetent at his vocation. In Japanese culture, suicide is an acceptable method of regaining lost honor and it does not have the approbation it receives in the West-in fact, the author of thestory, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, later died by suicide himself. So an atoning suicide was better than losing a fair fight to a common thief.<br /><br /> The wife's lying is more problematical. Why would she take the blame for Tajomaru's deed?  Perhaps she was angry at her husband for not preventing her rape, so wanted to add insult to injury by saying he was killed by a woman. This would be the same motive that caused her to instigate the fight to begin with, and she punished her husband further by denying his reputation the death in honorable combat.<br /><br /> The short story was left completely open, with no hint as to who to believe, so I like that version better, but the movie is masterful and will keep you thinking, almost as much as the short story, where it feels you could certainly know who to believe if you could only figure out who has the woman's sword.hor of the story, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, later died by suicide himself.

B000002H33|5.0|Although the leap from \\"Kill 'Em All\\" to \\"Ride The Lightning\\" was by far the biggest and best leap they've made in the history of their career, \\"Master Of Puppets\\" has to be their crowning performance. The template for \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is almost exactly the same as \\"Ride The Lightning\\". That didn't stop critics from hailing the album as the best metal album of all time. It reached the top 30, and sold over 3 million albums, despite the nonexistent radio play.<br /><br />\\"Master Of Puppets\\" is not another reinvention of metal. It is simply a refinement of it's predecessors. The record feels more unified and solid; lyrically, thematically, and musically. The sound is thick in arrangements, which varies enough to hold the listeners attention through and through. Songs such as \\"Battery,\\" \\"Master Of Puppets,\\" and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" are staples in their career. Every track works cohesively with the next. Metallica is simply ruling the world at this point.
B000021YQV|1.0|This band absolutely sucks. All their songs sound the same the lead singer can't sing and he wants to be like the lead singer from Godsmack, but at least Godsmack makes a good sound. System of a Down makes a putrid sound and everytime I hear their song I want to puke.
B000002H97|5.0|After the complicated arrangements and flawed production of \\"...And Justice For All\\", Metallica realized that their sound was in need of a major overhaul. The days of building on the template for \\"Ride The Lightning\\" were over. The approach to this album, was to break down and streamline their sound. This would eventually make their music more accessible and commercialized as well. That does sound a little scary to some ears; but they managed to reach both heights, artistically and commercially.<br /><br />The songs on \\"Metallica\\" are more melodic, and immediate. Stripped down rockers like \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"Sad but True,\\" \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" hit much harder with the help they had from producer Bob Rock, also making them more accessible to a wider audience. Songs like \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" gave the record great balance, breaking up the album quite nicely.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this record completely commercialized Metallica. The album exploded so much, that all their past records eventually gained commercial status and airplay. \\"Metallica\\" is the apex of their career, selling over 15 million albums to date.
B0007O38F8|5.0|From the first song to the last this CD is solid.  the beats are on point.  I don't know what folk be talking about when they say this album sucks.  It's got west coast influence and he is an east coast brother.  Give him his prop cause he deserves it.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Believe it or not, I didn't catch \\"Superman\\" until April, 2004. It's a great flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated -- like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable) -- the movie definitely stands the test of time. In other words, there's no reason to do a remake -- they got it RIGHT the first time.<br /><br />For a good review of \\"Superman\\" just breeze through the many fine critiques here at Amazon; for example, \\"thornhillatthemovies\\" just below me has a nice, thorough review.<br /><br />The reason I'm writing is to point something out that no other reviewer has mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is incredibly voluptuous and gorgeous! Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this? WATCH OUT for the pool scene wherein Ms. Perrine is wearing a green one-piece bathing suit -- her God-given curves are stunning! I caught this scene on TV late one night and it convinced me to buy the flick.<br /><br />Another thing occurred to me while watching the film that few reviewers mention: \\"Superman\\" is not just a comic-booky superhero flick, it's a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema! The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando, one of my favorite actors, playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip \\"Superman\\" just because you assume it's some mere superhero movie. No, it's more, much more. In fact, the screenplay was obviously written with absolutely no concern about cost, so MANY are the great F/X sequences. Enjoy.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Go away haters. This album rocks, and you know it, that's why you're giving it rotten reviews to bring the album down. However, as the old adage says, you can't bring a good man down. In this case, a good album. <br /> <br />And the fact that you review Mariah's album means that she is significant enough in your lives to even make an effort to write biased and uninformed comments on the album. Here's my suggestion: Why don't you ACTUALLY buy the album and REALLY listen to it. Maybe you'll change your mind, but it doesn't matter because people (a lot of them) are still gonna buy the album because it's excellent. <br /> <br />Hahahahahahaha!!! <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I didn't believe it at first. That's what the label said about Charmbracelet and it disappointed me. However, when I bought Mimi, the Voice is really there. I'm so glad I took the chance and bought the CD. Great R&B collection!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I wonder why there are reviews that give this album just 1 star. If you read all the 1 star reviews, not one, not a single one ever comments about the songs, the album, the production, or anything that's music related. It's very obvious that these people haven't even heard the album, and gave Mariah poor reviews. Maybe they should be reviewing themselves. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the 5 star (or even 4) reviews comment on everything that's related to this album, a clear indication that they have purchased and listened to it. <br /> <br />Now, who would you believe? <br /> <br />In my personal Mimi experience, I was very satisfied, so I gave it 5 stars. <br /> <br />I wish they release Say Something as the third single. Universal, c'mon!!!
B00005JNRB|4.0|Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt finally comes back to the big screen in the form of Matthew McConaughey.  He is a treasure hunter of sorts, working for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, and aided by good friend Al Giordino (Zahn).  Dirk has been looking for a lost Civil War boat -- in Africa -- for a while.  His boss, Admiral Sandecker (Macy) and Al both think he is crazy, but still he presses on.<br /><br />Eva Rojas (Cruz) is a doctor for the World Health Organization, looking for the source of a new plague in Africa.  Pitt show up in time to save her life, and since they are working in the same area, they decide to team up.  Of course, things are more than they initially seem, and soon Pitt finds himself in the position of having to save the world.<br /><br />\\"Sahara\\" stretches the boundaries of believeability, but that is not the movie's fault so much as the source material's.  Clive Cussler novels have a tendency for over the top story lines, but that is part of their charm -- much like James Bond movies.  \\"Sahara\\" the movie is a little lighter in tone than the novel, and perhaps that is why the story seems far-fetched at times.<br /><br />McConaughey and Zahn convincingly portray life long friends and adventurers, even if they would not seem like the best choice to fill Cussler's characters.  Their relationship is the centerpiece of the movie, and it is very funny at times.  Cruz is bland as the love interest, and adds little to the movie.  Macy is his usual great self as the grumbling Sandecker.  \\"Sahara\\" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  I had some worries after seeing the trailers, given that I have read all the books, but director Breck Eisner pulls it off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chances for a sequel are slim to none despite the amount of material available from Clive Cussler.  During the production of the movie, the producers and Cussler had a falling out over the direction the film was heading and there are lawsuits pending.  My recommendation is to enjoy this Dirk Pitt adventure, because it might be the last for a while.commendation is to enjoy this Dirk Pitt adventure, because it might be the last for a while.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|I originally saw the British TV show which was nothing short of tremendious! I thorouhly recommend any of your buyers with a PAL/NTSC and region free dvd player to buy them on amazon.co.uk, pick up Bling Bling or Aiii. The HBO series recycles a lot of the sketches, some are better some are not, great guests though..  <br />No matter which side of the pond you're from, the movie is a distant third place, very disappointing. Avoid.
0743244249|3.0|I read it quickly, enjoying some of the passages which were funny at times, insightful and sometimes cruel. A book I will remember, but did not manage to engage me. I would not recommend it, but would not dismiss it either, some of the qualities are worth exploring.
B0000028PL|5.0|These guys get no love...this album smokes-the band is on fire, period. I havn't listened to this in a while, and it sounds as good, if not better, than I remember. The production is mint-the bass is clear, the guitars thick, shreddin' and heavy, the drums are poundin', this album is just a sonic boom. I have to compare them to the Chili Peppers for the sole reason that the vocals are the weak link-Corey sounds great and all, but the band behind him is just a MACHINE...a FORCE. This band deserves respect, and I resent the fact that they don't get it...because when you talk about Living Colour, all people remember is the guy with the dreads dancin' around in a dayglo Body Glove outfit. Yikes.
0393035158|1.0|The book is much like any other humanistic/atheistic tract.  The writer of this book attacks those who hold to faith, especially those who are following in the race a Judeo-Christian worldview. Why does this book and books like it attack Christians especially?  Because Faith is bad, especially Judeo-Christian faith.  Religion is evil, especially Judeo-Christian religion.  \\"All\\" religions are evil, \\"All\\" religions serve no purpose.  The book says that through reason and through \\"intelligence\\" we will find that we are ourselves at the center of the universe.  The belief is simple, the belief is that man is the center of the universe and what man wants man deserves to get or to do or to have.  The god of atheism is right in the mirror, oneself.  The god of atheism is right there before your very eyes.  The End of Faith and books like it are like tornados, trying desperately to destroy anything and everything before them.  Why?  Why are writers and believers such as the author of this book so keen on thinking they can destroy faith?  Fear.  Fear that they themselves will be challenged and then judged for the actions done by them throughout life.  We are our own destiny, we are our own champions through evolution such believers as the writer and the supporter of this book and books like it.  These are ideologies I've heard a thousand times and probably hear a thousand more.<br /><br />Yes.  In the name of religions many an evil has occurred.  Many so called Christians have gone out and attacked and hurt and killed those whom they strove to control.  I will not deny that.  But. Such believers did not act in the true belief of what God speaks of in His revelation to us all, the Bible.  For example there are those so-called Christians who have attacked, abused, and brought into submission women by saying that it was Eve's fault for sin.  Well, that is a lie, to an extent.  If one truly read the Bible, they would see that God says that it is Adam that has brought the Curse upon mankind and the earth.  It is the Adamic Curse that causes evil and turmoil and death in the world.  Thus the reason Christ came, to hold victory over the sins so that whomsoever has faith in Christ Jesus will not die and be in eternal separation from God, no, instead one who holds faith will have eternal life in the name of Christ.  In the name of religion there have been those who have been cheated, beaten, enslaved, and killed.  As a historian and a theologian, I do not deny this.  I do not hide from this fact.  I say unto this that those who did those things may have \\"said\\" they were of a particular religion, but they were not tenants of that religion (Christianity) because they would not have done those deeds if they were truly of that religion (Christianity).  Even more so...In the true name of religion, and as a Christian, and in the name of Christ, much good HAS occurred in the cause of human history and human destiny.  The women's movement was founded on Christian beliefs.  The child protection movement was founded on Christian beliefs.  Education in America was founded on Christian beliefs.  The fight against slavery and the fight for equality was founded on Christian beliefs.<br /><br />Still.  The End of Faith?  What would be the product?  If faith was outlawed, if faith was forced to end, then what would be the outcome?  Simply this.  The end of faith would be an end to hope.  There would be no hope for war weary societies because war doesn't matter.  Why doesn't it matter?  Because at the end of faith there is no good no evil just \\"species selection\\" and \\"social darwinism\\".  The end of faith would mean there is no hope for those who have been wounded deeply--those who have been rapped, those who have had to see loved ones die of diseases, those who have been abused as a wife or as a child, those who have been tattered and torn.  Without faith, there is no hope.  Without faith, there is no tomorrow.  Without faith, there is no reason to live.  Why should we live if there is no faith for that greater something, that greater force, that God...that personal God...especially the Christian God who sent His Son to die for us and rise up for us.  No faith means no hope, no joy, no laughter.  No faith means no desire for something greater, desire for something purer, desire for something precious.<br /><br />Again, then, what is faith?  You say there is a need for an end of faith, well then what is your definition of faith?  I trust my definition of faith to the Bible (that book that you hate so much).  In the Letter to Hebrews, faith is keenly defined as the following.  \\"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.\\"  Hebrews 11:1.  You are right, I suppose, I cannot possibly snap my fingers and low and behold, God appears.  You ask for proofs, and you are given proofs of God's truth in the Bible in archeology, history, theology, and lives changed for the better by following a literalist truth found in the Bible.  Still, you could have God appear right before you indeed, and you would still not believe because you allow your pride, your arrogance, your darkness and your death and your hopelessness to blind you because you want all of those to blind you.  Of course God says passionately to you, in the Psalms 14, \\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\\"<br /><br />Yes I have faith, I have faith in the race that I am racing and the destination I am heading for.  I know inherently and intimately that there is indeed a God.  I have opened my eyes, allowing God to speak to my mind, my heart, my soul, and I see how God has changed my life.  You call religion a crutch, but you yourself in your atheism walks along with a crutch because you are so fearful of the fact that \\"if there is a God\\" then you yourselves will be judged for the wickedness you have done in your lives.  I have seen the lives of those who are aiming toward the Lord change for the better, and I have seen those lives that are lead by the pride of disbelief changed for the worse.  I have seen those who lived by faith in Christ have peace even in the worst of situation, and I have seen those who live by their own egotism (atheism) have no peace no matter what simply because they stumble in the darkness of their own making and their own choosing.  I do not care for scoffers and for unbelievers views toward me, but I will stand not by my own power but by the love and grace and holiness of the Lord through this life I live... not even afraid of death itself...I listen keenly to the promise of the Lord \\"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.  In this world you will have trouble.  But take heart!  I have overcome the world.\\" John 16:33.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if it happens in my own life time, that Christians are rounded up and sent to concentration camps because of books like this and other books that are so phobic and hate filled against Christians.  In this humanistic day an age, where antagonism is found in our liberal government, our liberal \\"religious\\" movements\\", our liberal school and college systems, Christianity...as in this book...is labeled and vilified more and more.  Still I believe that there can't be an end to faith because I believe I do have faith and will continue to have faith in the one true God.  The God who sent Jesus to die for my sins, to rise again.  I have this faith because I realize there is something greater in this universe then merely myself.  I will not follow into the egotistical trappings of humanism and atheism.  Instead, with my faith, I will strive to win that race.  I will not deny hope for mmyself or for those I meet along the way in this life.  With this faith I will strive to help those who need it...from homeless shelters to missions across the globe to my very own home church and the people in the church I belong to.  With this faith that I will not allow to end, I will do my best to help as many people and to teach as many people about Christ as possibly.  I do this not out of humanistic egotism that wants to make myself feel good and look good (as when humanistic followers say they try to help society), but instead I do this out of the love of Christ that is given to me and I give to others freely out of my own free will.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|With each of their CD's change comes in some for or another. Now change can be looked at as being bad or being good. Here it is more good but a little for the worse as well.<br /><br />Nothing can compare to their debut: Homework. That was just a phenomenal breakthrough CD. Their second CD was still good (not as good as the the first) but with quite a bit of change. On this third effort......more change. Less vocals (whick I, personally, prefer a little more of a vocal) and the sounds seem to be quite similar going song to song. Yes, they make you want to get up and find a dance floor and bust a move but it does seem to get quite repetitive after a few listens.<br /><br />I do like it. But, I have to listen in small doses.
B0006213WG|2.0|Ok first off let me start by saying I am new to Sum 41. I never heard any other of their previous albums and after listening to this one, I don't really have the desire to do so. It is true that Sum 41 copied a lot of other bands on Chuck but that doesn't really matter to me. If a band plays good and makes good music I don't really care how or from who they got their ideas. I didn't really like the album mostly becuase I don't like their style of music. Almost all the tracks sound the same, you can't tell one from another. Also, most of the tracks have beats that are too fast for my liking. I only enjoyed 4 tracks on the album: 5, 8, 11, 12. Personally I like Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue much better.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This Mariah CD cannot really be compared to any other Mairah CD or any other CD out there as of now. It's different and unique. After the big disappointment of Charmbracelet I felt pretty confident with the boomin' fist single: \\"It's Like That\\"! I could not wait any long for this CD to come out! I was at the store at midnight when it first went on sale.<br /><br />I have heard this CD described as \\"the voice is back\\" - TRUE! I have also heard this CD described as being \\"A party disc\\" - TRUE! There is some hot beats on here that make you just want to move....but with an amazing voice like Mariah's you have to make sure that when you have a sick beat you don't overshadow the beat by oversinging - which she does not do. She saves that for the slower tunes where it is more appropriate.<br /><br />1. It's Like That - A song that no one can keep off their mind. In my opinion the club song of 2005.  5/5<br /><br />2. We Belong Together - I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!  Awesome midtempo song that I believe is going to be her next single and be a huge hit.  5/5<br /><br />3. Shake It Off - Hot beat! Good lyrics. Chours get's a little repetitive but still a goodie.  4.5/5<br /><br />4. Mine Again - A Slower song. Reminds me of a good 70's R&B groove.  4.5/5<br /><br />5. Say Somethin' - Not to crazy about this song or Snoops vocals in it.  2/5<br /><br />6. Stay The Night - A slower song. A nice groove. I like it! 5/5<br /><br />7. Get Your Number - Another nice club number with awesome lyrics and an awesome beat!  5/5<br /><br />8. One And Only - HOT SONG! Will for sure be a hit! Twista is good on this song!  5/5<br /><br />9. Circles - Slower. VERY great lyrics. Reminds me of the \\"Hero\\" years.  5/5<br /><br />10. Your Girl - Reminds me, again of another great 60's or 70's midtempo R&B song. GREAT vocals  5/5<br /><br />11. I Wish You Knew - Great song. Sung in front of a live audience. Signature Mariah vocals.  5/5<br /><br />12. To The Floor - Bangin' club song with Nelly! SO good! Another sure fire hit! Too short a song though!  5/5<br /><br />13. Joy Ride - This is a Mariah Carey ballad ALL THE way! LOVE it!  5/5<br /><br />14. Fly Like A Bird - Good ending to the CD. Again that 70's midtempo feeling to it. Very nicely done. Great vocals.<br /><br />I am SO happy with this CD and you will be too! Indeed, the voice *IS* back!!!!!!g though!   5/5 <br />13. Joy Ride - This is a Mariah Carey ballad ALL THE way! LOVE it!   5/5 <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - Good ending to the CD. Again that 70's midtempo feeling to it. Very nicely done. Great vocals. <br /> <br />I am SO happy with this CD and you will be too! Indeed, the voice *IS* back!!!!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I suspect the bad reviews for this album are probably written by J-Lo and Beyonce themselves.  Mariah can sings \\"CIRCLES\\" around them, and any of the competition out there.  Don't hate her.  She's talented and well deserving of 150 MILLION ALBUM SOLD. Thats right baby... more than the BEATLES and ELVIS. I believe radio is hating on her for they fear she may surpassed 180 million, and then be  so far out of reach, and that no-one can \\"EVER\\" outsell her.
B00005JNTV|4.0|This past Sunday, I went to see Sin City, another in my recent binge of comic-book-based flicks. The film is comprised of three main stories. One features an unrecognizable Mickey Roarke as a reformed ex-con enforcer-type, who's been set up for murder. Another features Bruce Willis as an about-to-retire straight-shooter cop, who takes the fall for a nasty crime he didn't commit. The last features Clive Owen as a defender of the Old Town ladies of the evening, who run into a spot of trouble when they off an abusive, seedy chap who turns out to be a cop. There's a large, talented, well-known cast...except for Jessica Alba, who's nice looking but I'm not yet convinced that she's picked up any acting chops.<br /><br />The movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core. Everything's noir-ish, in primary comic-book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling. The dialog is similarly stylized, and it's also pretty crude at times...not for younger children. Lots of stylized, noir-ish violence to be seen here as well. Just for reference, there's nowhere near as much violence here as in, say, Kill Bill Volume 1.<br /><br />All in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie. Surprised by how will Roarke did; it's been a long time since I've seen him in anything. Worth seeing...but don't be taking your kids.
1577314808|4.0|With no experience in \\"spiritual writings,\\" I started listening to \\"The Power of Now\\" on CD. Although I have yet to hear the reportedly biased ideas regarding special access to presence for women or gays, I have heard more than enough to have learned to recognize presence in myself and to laugh at the insanity of my mind-generated dark moods and recurring funks.<br /><br />Tolle does have something of a \\"holier (more spiritual?) than thou\\" attitude, but it does not bother me. Quite the contrary, I feel like I have been waiting to hear this stuff my whole life. Another reviewer (IAF_67) complains of a lack of techniques or exercises for achieving \\"presence.\\" I don't think he or she was ready to hear how simple this is. You merely have to recognize the \\"voice\\" in your head that is so concerned with all the things it is concerned with as not your true self.<br /><br />Tolle asks if we want to be miserable. We do not, but he points out that so many of us are so intensely self-defined by our problems that we cannot see ourselves any other way. Too bad for them. Keep reading. Start over if you need to. Much as my differential calculus professor told the class years ago - just keep after it, you will get it eventually.<br /><br />I went to my daughter's confirmation the other night. Her younger brother was \\"about to die\\" wanting to leave. My wife was not too keen on sitting around afterward for the refreshments, either. Thanks to Tolle, I was able to avoid sharing their stress, I reveled in the joy of so many others around us, I hugged and kissed my daughter . . . and had another piece of cake!<br /><br />Today is my favorite day! Treat every moment as if it is the one you chose. Read Tolle.
B00007LTIC|5.0|After a \\"Relayer\\" album that pretty much sounded like a third disc from Topographic Oceans and was missing one of the group's best assets (Rick Wakeman, on keyboards), and before my non-favorite \\"Tormato\\" and the off album (more like pre-Asia) \\"Drama\\", Yes went into the studio to record some of the best works ever. The result was the album with the naked guy in the cover: \\"Going for the one\\".<br /><br />After a very Rock'N Roll opening song, the album goes into full swing with one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear: \\"Turn of the Century\\". Steve Howe's impeccable guitar work is paralled with Anderson's transparent voice and Wakeman doing keyboards in the background, to create a true piece of art that will stick with you forever.<br /><br />\\"Parallel\\" takes on a classic Yes sound, followed by yet another mellow tune, \\"Wonderous Stories\\" (though not as powerful as \\"Turn...\\"). Closing the album, the 15+ minute long track, \\"Awaken\\" has a progressive take, gradually bringing in and out instruments in the best style of \\"Close to the Edge\\", all in the midst of a very dreamy environment that waraps up the album in the highest possible note.<br /><br />Maybe not a starting point for a collection of Yes albums, but still a must in any Yes collection. If you want the best of Yes, get \\"Close to the Edge\\" first, probably followed by the \\"Yes Album\\" or \\"Fragile\\". If you want a good live compilation, go for \\"YesSongs\\".
B0007GAERG|4.0|I knew I was going to get this album after hearing the two single releases, \\"It's Like That\\" & \\"We Belong Together\\" (both excellent songs imho). I was not disappointed with this purchase and out of the three recent albums by r&b divas that I've purchased (Mariah, Faith Evans, & Tweet), Mariah's disc ranks a strong 2nd in terms of my enjoyment of the music, behind Faith and wayyy ahead of Tweet.  Anyway, I'm in the minority of people who really enjoyed Charmbracelet and didn't view TEOM as a \\"comeback record\\" in the least - I was simply excited about getting my hands on some great new music from one of my favorite singers.<br /><br />I really love the fact that most of the songs on this disc have a live instrumentation sound that I'm digging (think Jill Scott's production).  More artists should listen to tracks from the 70's to draw inspiration from artists like Donny Hathaway, Minnie Ripperton, Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, E,W&F, The Isley Brothers, etc - the lyrics for songs were simplistic but the delivery was heartfelt and songs from that era just sound better to me than the overproduced garbage that r&b producers have been churning out since the early 90's.<br /><br />I've listened to the disc a few times straight through and must say that I enjoy every song except \\"One & Only\\" & \\"Your Girl\\".<br /><br />The tracks that I really love are:<br /><br />It's Like That - infectious beat & I love the chorus \\"no stress, no fights, I'm leaving it all behind!\\" 5/5<br /><br />We Belong Together - great ballad, she does not oversing the song and I beg to differ with another poster - she doesn't screech at the end, she hit the trademark Mariah $$$$ note  5/5<br /><br />Mine Again - love the beautiful live music feel of this ballad, has a great old school vibe  5/5<br /><br />Say Somethin - love that she's not overpowered by the guest (Snoop), love the Neptunes vibe/beat and the crazy drum beats - good sound for Mariah  5/5<br /><br />Stay the Night - love how the sample was used  4.5/5<br /><br />Get Your Number - funny song, love the sample, Mariah rapping about her possessions and the \\"begging brother\\"  4.5/5<br /><br />Circles - a mid tempo groove, love the music production 4.5/5<br /><br />I Wish You Knew - beautiful ballad, reminds me of 'Subtle Invitation' from Charmbracelet  5/5<br /><br />To The Floor - love the collabo w/ Nelly, has a great old school vibe 5/5<br /><br />Joy Ride - reminds me of 'Bliss' - lush love song  4/5<br /><br />Fly Like A Bird - great inspirational song  5/5<br /><br />Overall, it's a great album - production wise and vocally she sounds fantastic.how the sample was used  4.5/5 <br /> <br />Get Your Number - funny song, love the sample, Mariah rapping about her possessions and the \\"begging brother\\"  4.5/5 <br /> <br />Circles - a mid tempo groove, love the music production 4.5/5 <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew - beautiful ballad, reminds me of 'Subtle Invitation' from Charmbracelet  5/5 <br /> <br />To The Floor - love the collabo w/ Nelly, has a great old school vibe 5/5 <br /> <br />Joy Ride - reminds me of 'Bliss' - lush love song  4/5 <br /> <br />Fly Like A Bird - great inspirational song  5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great album - production wise and vocally she sounds fantastic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay, another reviewer here suggests that if you don't believe the almost ONE THOUSAND positive reviews on amazon for this show, rent it first. you'll come back to purchase it. i am here to tell you he was right. i rented the 1st 2 discs (1st 8 episodes) from my local video store on a whim. I watched them in a single weekend, then decided to just purchase the whole set instead of renting the last 2 discs, even though i would have saved $40 by doing that. <BR> <BR> This show is so excellent it makes me sad there are only 14 episodes. i am now counting the days to the movie premiere in september (2005). the acting, the writing, the effects are all so excellent. the humour just kills me. when was the last time you didn't know whether to laugh or gasp while watching a torture scene? that's right -- laugh! a comic torture scene! one of so many excellent scenes that i am delighted i splurged on this DVD set. <BR><BR> The characters are so well developed, and i love how little things in latter episodes connect to former ones. i hope the movie is so successful the series comes back to TV. someone else wrote that Firefly seems like a love letter from Joss Whedon. I'm inclined to agree. This whole series is a love letter to storytelling. And don't you jus twonder why 999 people took the time to write reviews for this show on amazon? And it keeps the 4.5 star rating. that's impressive. i love this show so much this is my 1st review for amazon.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I jus love this song... WARNING <br />donno why, if its the lyrics or its super strange melody or the rhythm BUT <br />boy do I love this song!!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is another favorite movie of mine. It is really well done. The action and the special effects are really cool. If you like superhero action flicks, you'll like this movie.
B00001OH80|2.0|Even upon its 1984 release, David Bowie's \\"Tonight\\" was considered a major letdown after the breakthrough success of \\"Let's Dance\\" (1983). However, there are a few memorable tracks scattered among the wreckage. \\"Blue Jean,\\" \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Neighborhood Threat\\" certainly stand out, but \\"Loving the Alien\\" and the wretched remake of \\"God Only Knows\\" represent Bowie at his self-parodying worst. The title song cries for a remix, since it buries Tina Turner's accompanying vocal. What was Bowie thinking? If you must purchase this directionless effort, hunt down the out-of-print Ryko version with the bonus tracks of \\"Absolute Beginners\\" and \\"This Is Not America.\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|Just wanted to say thank you to Mariah if she ever reads these reviews.  Thank you for giving us a wonderful album.  Having been a fan since day 1 and have every cd she's ever made; I can truly say that this one is truly special.  It showcases the Mariah of now and the Mariah of the 90's.  I've listened to this cd repeatedly at home and work. If you are a true fan.... you will love this.  And for those of you who weren't fans before welcome to the club because you will become on with this cd. Every song to me is the bomb she could do no wrong with this one.
B000002H97|5.0|Ok I'm at a tie w/Metallica's cds Master of Puppets, Justice for all and this one. I think its one of the most underated cds in metal and I think when you listen to it you'd agree w/me that this cd rules w/o a question. This cd is legendary w/songs 1-6 and then song #8 being radio singals and some of the other songs on this cd are alot of crowd favs to hear at concerts. This is cd really awesome. Come on its Metallica forget some of there recent cds travel back to this cd and the other 2. Its some of the best music you'll hear in metal. BUY THIS CD TODAY NOW!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle makes great albums by allowing understatement to guide their music. Maynard and Billy allow the music to breathe deeply in the places it most needs to, before allowing the tougher passages to make their statement. It's a tricky tightwire to walk, but on their sophomore album, they do it with expert ease. It takes over 4 minutes before the first real powerful electric guitar moment releases the tension out of \\"The Package,\\" but it is an exquisite payoff. In an album that makes constant references to addiction and the personalities that succumb, having the tranquility of the album explode into Maynard shouting \\"give this to me!\\" lays the template for the album to come.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Step\\" (the name comes either from El Monasterio del Escorial where Kings of Spain are buried at the foot of thirteen marble steps so as to instill dread in the visitor, or as a poke at the 12 step process of rehabbing from substance abuse) is a dread-laden set of songs that spend a lot of time posing questions. Think of how \\"The Noose\\" goads the protagonist over the fallen halo. Or how \\"Blue\\" is such a lovely shade for the dead (dying?) girl.<br /><br />The best moment here (and eventually reprised on the brilliant \\"Emotive\\") is \\"Pet.\\" Either a song that stares down a junky's denial or the country's head in the sand absolution of post 9/11 government duplicity, it cuts deep with a lyric that is closer to Tool than anything on the remainder of \\"Thirteenth Step.\\"<br /><br />\\"Safe from pain and truth and other poison devils...<br /><br />I'll be the one to protect you<br /><br />from your enemies and your demons.<br /><br />From a will to survive and a voice of reason.<br /><br />From your enemies and your choices, son,<br /><br />they're one in the same.\\"<br /><br />APC make thought provoking music and they do it with an ear towards both the music and the mind. A worthy addition to all parties' resumes.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have been intrigued by the broadway production from the first time i saw it and has noticed something new everytime i saw it.  <br />Which is why I can say the movie fullfilled that need.  You get to see what you may miss in the live show. All the power and passion that is needed to transpire in the live show is there in the movie.  <br />\\"Christine\\" is perfectly cast, and for those looking for Sarah, HELLO, the part is of a young, inexperenced (for lack of better word -) virgin.  I am sure Sarah would agree.  \\"the dashing suiter\\" is perfect as well, he has the properisums that are called for on the part. Remember people this is a movie,  get the story across.  <br />And \\"Phantom\\" is just as he should be, wild, unrefined and genuis gone mad with love.   <br />If you don't like musicals, DUH, don't see it, but if you can have a open mind to something other than special effects, blood and violence that we have all been bombarded with, open your mind to a new way of entertainment.  <br />Who knows, you might find a new appreciation for real movies and what they are suppose to do. Be fantsy and let your mind go to a place that the writers of movies would like you to go, somewhere you can't go in everyday life.  ........ ENJOY !
B0007GAERG|5.0|I got this CD the first day it came out, and I was totally blown away. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" really shows how beautiful Mariah's voice is. Many people said that Mariah's voice and \\"look\\" is copying Beyonce. Well, that is soooo NOT TRUE. Mariah does not compare to Beyonce at all. They both have different voices and styles. Mariah has also been out WAY longer that Beyonce has. She created her style and vocal sound.  Every song is worth listening to. Here's my full review of every song: <br /> <br />1. It's Like That- a fun r&b/hip-hop song. good beat and vocals. when this song came out, i wasn't loving it but it grew on me. <br />2. We Belong Together- a sad and heartwarming song. this sounds like a classic smooth mariah song. it reminds me of Breakdown and My All. <br />3. Shake It Off- an upbeat r&b jam. i really love this song! mariah's vocals are awesome. this song should be a single. <br />4. Mine Again-  a slow smooth jam which has like a old-school 70's influence. mariah's vocals are sooo soulfull in this song. her voice sounds so rich.  <br />5. Say Somethin'- this song sounds very fresh and modern.(produced by the neptunes) snoop dogg adds a spicy touch to it. awesome beat and the chorus is addicting. you'll find yourself singing this like crazy. <br />6. Stay The Night- this one is produced by Kanye West. It has a 70's old-school influence. mariah's AMAZING vocals remind everyone that her voice is in excellent condition and she's back. a very soul-full and r&b song. <br />7. Get Your Number- in this song, Jermaine Dupri sounds a lot like Nelly. i think that;s he's trying to hard. However, the song is very catchy and it seems radio-fun. Not one of my favorites...but it's a cute fun song. <br />8. One and Only- wow. the first time i heard this song...i played it over and over again. The smooth r&b beat reminds me of Mariah's \\"The One\\" from the Charmbracelet album.  The guitar sounds so good in the song.  Twista's rap is also so amazing. This song should be mariah's next single. it's very radio-friendly. <br />9. Circles- i love this song...one of my all time favorites. mariah again uses all of her vocal strength for this one. <br />10. Your Girl- sounds like an old-school type of school. mariah's voice again shines. the chorus is very strong and catchy. <br />11. I Wish You Knew- i love this song, primarily because i can totally relate to it.But also because it sounds like a classic Mariah ballad you could hear from Butterfly or Daydream. at one part, mariah actually speaks to a live crowd...and you could hear the crowd cheering. the song sounds sooo real and genuine. <br />12. To The Floor- duet with Nelly. this hip-hop song is radio-friendly and it has a great beat to it. nelly's smooth vocals add some sexy spice to it. <br />13. Joy Ride- typical mariah ballad. this song reminds me of \\"Yours\\" from Charmbracelet. A beautiful ballad about finding love. <br />14. Fly Like A Bird- a beautifully written gospel/soul song and OUTSTANDING vocals. an amazing song for the closure of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has always been one of the best singers around, but she redefines her voice by going back to the basics. She knows how to make a hit song. That's no mystery because she's been doing it for years now. So it shouldn't come as a surprise, although it will be for many, that she could put together an album that probably plays more like a greatest hits collection. Almost every song on this album could or should be a #1 hit. Radio has changed so the latter has become more difficult even for the best of the best. But Mariah doesn't hold back. She gives her fans exactly what they want: powerful ballads, her signature mid-tempos, and trailblazing rap/sung collaborations. Mimi has been freed. Mariah gives 100% and more on this record. You won't be disappointed.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Finally!  This CD is FIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE!!!!  It's been a long time since I've been able to play a cd without skipping around.  I don't care how crazy people say she is or how many breakdowns she's had---She is definitely back and I'm glad because the industry needed her.  I love you Mariah!  I have always been a fan since day one, I have all her cds but I'm so impressed with this album I'm going to join her fan club.
0385510454|5.0|John Grisham's back. For those of you sleeping on JG, it's time to wake up. It's been a confusing ride but I've stuck with JG from A Time to Kill all the way through to the Broker. This latest effort solidifies his status as one of the best writers out there today. This novel though can definitely merit a Part II.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this album a few days ago and do not rate anything until I have played it in it's entirety a few times.  It takes time for songs to grow on you, how will you know if you like it by sampling?  Anyway, now that I've had time to listen and enjoy, I think this is a great come back for Mariah!!  She has some nice dance, love, and inspirational songs on this album and they all are excellent!  The only thing we can't do is sing along, cause this girl has a high range. Also, check out BET, they have ran a special with her singing a few old songs and new ones from the Emancipation of Mimi...Buy this cd, you will enjoy!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD because, as a child, I loved the Oz books. I even enjoyed the Judy Garland movie, although it a lot of liberties with the book. In a similar way, I enjoyed this one. <br /> <br />The DVD story is a conflation of the 2nd and 3rd Oz books: The Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. The preponderance is towards the latter. The characters in the film are very much in keeping with Baum's characterizations in his books and even tend to look like the John R. Neill illustrations.  <br /> <br />The biggest deviation from the original comes in the first 20 minutes. It has virtually nothing in common with the books and the idea of Dorothy being stuck in a mental hospital is a bit jarring. That being said, the young lady playing the part is very much like the young, innocent and extremely polite character Baum conceived. This is in contrast to Judy Garland who was much older and more sophisticated. <br /> <br />Persons looking for a strict adaptation of the book will be dissapointed to the same degree dissapointment was experienced with the classic movie. This one does not have the big production numbers of a Hollywood musical; that may be a loss for some but is a plus for me. Take this movie for what it is, a loose adaptation of beloved books.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood - takes me back to the sixties on this one! <br />\\"Say You Will,\\" CD only proves that wine does get better with age. Fleetwood Mac keeps getting better, just when I thought they couldn't. They topped themselves on this one! Lindsey's voice is hauntingly beautiful, and Stevie's voice is like no other. Brilliant musicians, every one of them - John, Mick, Lindsey & Stevie. Christine, where are you? If you love Fleetwood - buy this CD and the DVD Destiny Rules! One more thing - \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" is spellbinding!  Long Live Fleetwood Mac! <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|No matter where you go, there you are. After six television series, ten motion pictures, and endless books and conventions, Star Trek, the original 1966 television show has reclaimed it's greatness.In it's first and greatest season, humanity was the running theme. Allthough the writers, some of the greatest, science fiction or otherwise, worked with a brick wall of a canon or writers' guide, somehow made the characters  believable in a fantastic stage of storytelling. Watching these episodes now as an adult,  maturity has added a new dimension to the viewing. Duty, honor, accountability, sacrifice, and unconditional love, are intertwined between the characters. Star Trek has an unfortunate stigma of geekdom attached to it, which it unfairly made it's fans targets of ridicule. But when you watch an episode such as the Naked Time, where an alien virus, brings out the infected crews inner emotions and fears out into the surface, in the final scene after the cure, Kirk gazes to Yoman Rand, without her noticing, he reaches out to touch her and in the same motion draws his hand back, proclaiming, \\"no beach to walk on\\". He realizes he could never have a woman in his life, because of the Enterprise. In the same episode, Nurse Chapel, explains to Spock, that she will love him unconditionally, in which he is terrified that he doesn't understand it. Hard to believe that this was 1960's television, the golden age of the 50's spilled on a space opera. Paramount has done an outstanding job with this box set. The masterly photography of Gerry Finnerman, is flawless and the sound is sharp and clear. I loved the menus and the extras, at least Mr. Shatner didn't tell his \\"bicycle story\\", I heard too much at conventions. But the thing that made me most happy, is that The City on the Edge of Forever, had been restored. In the 1980's when the shows were first out on video, City has a scene with Mr. Shatner (his greastest performance on the series) and Joan Collins, are walking down thestreet hand in hand, while a 1930 radio plays a singer crooning, \\"good night sweetheart\\". The song was important because this is the scene where their love for each other is getting deeper. I suppose due to copywrite problems, the song was replaced along with the underscore of it in key sequences, with something less effective. But, now the song is back! I will not complain about the price or packaging, to me it is worth the price, and it sets the standard, not by price but quality. I would have liked the blooper reel or the film sent to the Venice Film Festival. Also, I would have like to have had an interview with Grace Lee Whitney, I would have been interested to hear her take of what happened to her character and her life as an Star Trek icon. She was too much woman to igore, too much woman.

B0007GAERG|2.0|Mariah is truly a remarkable artist, but this album is definately not an Emancipation. What is she free from: being at the top of the charts or using her magnificent voice to its fullest? This album's most catchy song is \\"It's Like That,\\" and that's like... all. I can't even remember any lyrics from other songs, and I just listened to the CD thirty minutes ago. And yeah, she uses her full vocals on a few of the songs, but it isn't enough - the music overshadows her. I am a big Mariah fan, and I was so very excited about the release of her album that I even downloaded the Emancipation screensaver. I bought it the morning it arrived in stores and listened to it in second period at school... I was pretty disappointed. I miss the Mariah who sang her butt off on beautiful ballads with heartfelt vocals. I even think Charmbracelet is more deserving of credit than this, even though it didn't receive that credit.  It was only a small disappointment though because no matter how uncatchy the songs are, they are definately listenable. You did good Mariah, but you can do better. I'll continue to support her because I think she definately has the ability to make a TRUE comeback... A comeback that sends her back into the days of her most success and in my opinion, best music. Until the heavy R&B/Hip Hop obsession passes, however, I see little chance of her doing this... But I can always dream that she'll call up Walter Afanasieff and ask him to make some music with her. Sadly, that day may never come again, so for now I'll give her 2 stars for Below Average.
B00008DDXC|2.0|the 2nd installment too the harry potter series wasn't the best out there. because i thought that the first harry potter movie was better since it was funnier.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|This movie was so great!  It was so much better than the first Bridget movie.  Maybe I feel this way because I love Colin Firth, but there were so many things that I really liked in this movie.

B000003TA4|5.0|Simply put, it is impossible to hear this album with fresh ears. In the autumn of 1991, the cathartic wails and ramshackle guitar work of Kurt Cobain, the thundering bass of Krist Novoselic, and the abuse of the drums by David Grohl exploded onto American radio in the form of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" Many people had never heard anything as astonishing as that single, but it didn't stop there.  <br /> <br />Subsequent hit \\"In Bloom\\" featured perhaps the messiest, most lurching guitar solo ever committed to tape. \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Lithium\\" were ballads, but unlike any to ever hit the mainstream. \\"Breed\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings\\" were raw blasts of punk-rock. \\"Polly\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\" were spare acoustic songs. \\"Drain You\\" even made a detour into psychedelia.  <br /> <br />It is a testament to how great Nirvana was that they were able to cover so much ground on one record and execute it with perfection. YOU MUST BUY THIS!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Although different, more shocking and still in tune. The songs are not as bad as people <br />say that they are. People are just upset because this album is not as fun for kids as \\"Let Go\\" <br />was, \\"Under my Skin\\" is perfect, it is mature and yes I enjoyed \\"Let Go\\" but I also enjoyed \\"Under my Skin\\". We can tell that Avril has matured through the first track, \\"Take me Away\\" <br />and you can tell that she has matured also through the second track, \\"Together\\". \\"Don't tell Me\\" shows off more of the combination between \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Under my Skin\\". \\"He Wasn't\\" also shows off a little bit more of that \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Under my Skin\\" combination. <br />\\"How does it Feel\\" is incredibly made just for \\"Under my Skin\\". \\"My happy Ending\\" is also <br />made just for \\"Under my Skin\\". \\"Nobody's Home\\" is also made just for \\"Under my Skin\\" and is perfectly in tune with the album and gives off the maturity of the second album. \\"Forgotten,\\" <br />\\"Who Knows\\" and \\"Fall to Pieces\\" are very fun songs that you are able to sink into. \\"Freak Out\\" is an extremely fun song and very easy to go along with. \\"Slipped Away\\" is ok, and even though I know that she wrote it in dedication to her dead Grandpa, it doesn't give out as much enthusiasm as all of the other Avril Lavigne songs. So, overall, I would say, it's ok, you should buy it! <br />
B00005K9QP|5.0|Well this is one of the most memorable LPs of my life. I have been a Blues fan (fanatic?) for 40 years and it all started with this LP. I probably played along with the first side of this record everyday of my Junior year in High School. I had been introduced, as a teen age American, to R&B and Blues with the Rolling Stones, especially the 12x5 album, when they did Little Walter's (1950s version ala Jay \\"Hootie\\" McShann and Walter Brown's 1941 original) \\"Confessin' The Blues\\" (still the greatest Chicago Blues tune ever recorded by a British band). That was 1965, I got to know all the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley originals. But this record opened up the Chicago Blues-But done differently, not just mere imitation-(that has been suggested in previous reviews, but I never believed it-(check out the differences in style and arrangement and sound) they really didn't/couldn't do that and they knew it, or at least Clapton did. Mayall was older than the rest and he really wanted to emulate his idols in Chicago. Clapton had a deeper (and younger) perception on this genre- and was a White British guy! Clapton was a lot like his young protege Doyle Bramhall II on his latest Sessions for Robert J- an extension on his first ever recorded vocal \\"Ramblin' On My Mind\\" on this CD. Bramhall confessed he never listened to Johnson much before this session. Well Clapton had been with the Yardbirds (as we all know) and had been getting into Blues with Mayall's extensive record collection. He came to this session also with a fresh mind.<br /><br />The session was done at a loud- \\"club-like\\" sound level which perplexed the sound engineers. The distortion of the Marshall amp with the Les Paul was augmented by the sound engineers to make something really unique. The up front guitar of Clapton was something also never heard before (even with the Butterfield Band). This made it really different than Chicago Blues which tended to blend in overdriven tube amps with vocals and amplified harps. What a great and inspirational sound. This was the thing the caused Hendrix to take Blues to a different level and finally a different genre!<br /><br />Time is the great equalizer of all music, classical, jazz, blues, folk, it doesn't matter. This album still sounds good, but because it has been emulated by all blues-rockers for the last 40 years it can sound stale to the newcomer, oldcomer, or someone who has just heard it and notices it sounds \\"familiar\\" now. Also the tracks are not of uniform brilliance, after all it was just a hiped up night club set that they recorded. Clapton says that his recollection of the session was unpacking, playing, packing up and leaving. This shows to some degree how much we owe to Mike Vernon and the production team.<br /><br />The highlight of the set is usually ascribed to \\"Have You Heard\\", very interestingly redone on the 70th Birthday Concert DVD. However, the original had added horns and some B.B. King style licks from Clapton-something he got more and more into to the present day and he did even more of at the Birthday Concert. The fat and thick sound is the best part of this tune. Also it was an original Mayall penned tune. All of the best tunes on this LP were originals except for Hideaway. Clapton's rendition of the Freddie King's masterpiece took this tune to a new level-something similar to Stevie Ray Vaughan's rendition of Larry Davis' \\"Texas Flood\\". It became an old tune with a new sound and style. This is the number, to me, that changed the Blues to Blues-Rock!<br /><br />The other two classic tunes on this LP are the highly underrated and double-tracked \\"Double Crossing Time\\", supposedly about Jack Bruce. It is Mayall's greatest minor key blues, better than \\"The Death of J.B. Lenoir\\". The feeling in Clapton's guitar is unsurpassed. The other tune is \\"Little Girl\\" with its Jimmy Reed updated rock groove. Clapton does his best solo on this tune with precise bends over a difficult beat to keep up with. Walter Trout also dida good version of this tune with Mayall in the 1980s.<br /><br />The rest of the record is classic. The band itself was very good with Hugie Flint on drums and John McVie on the bass. Mayall made his international reputation with this disc and it has lasted to this day, he became the \\"Godfather of British Blues\\" because of this sound-and remember it was replicated (or tried to be replicated on his next 3 or 4 records). However, it does have some filler with tunes such as What I Say (the Brits loved Ray Charles) with a Day Tripper riff in part of it. And I never could understand why Mayall, who was only ever an average harp player, would do Little Walter's \\"It Ain't Right\\". However, this CD, with bonus cuts is essential for anyone who wants to understand the transition of the Blues into the evolution of Rock, Acid Rock, Metal and so on. It is truly a classic recording.h Mayall in the 1980s.    The rest of the record is classic. The band itself was very good with Hugie Flint on drums and John McVie on the bass.

Major Props to Jermaine Dupri from Producing this Club-Banger track, that will definately help mariah sell alot of albums.  Great Song, and a great Party song!<br /><br />We Belong Together(10/10)- The second single from the album, I heard this song about a week before the album came out, and I was like OH MY GOSH!!!  I was counting down like every single hour until her album came out.  This is the perfect second single off the album, and it also had a very good video to go with it.

Probably my second favorite song on the album.<br /><br />Get your Number(9/10)- This song is definately a a partying song, and is something you could dance to.  Not mariah's bet vocals, and not the best on the album, but it is a great! song nevertheless.  When I first head this track, I had no clue who was singing the chorus, because I didn't look at the back of the Album case, but when my eyes saw it was Jermaine Dupri, I was really suprised!  I never would have thought..It was rteally suprising, and a suprisingly good produced song he made there..definately a good partying song.<br /><br />One and Only(10/10)- This song sounds definately sounds like a mariah song, and Twista just adds his fast cool Flow to the track, which just makes it even better.

I love the message it gives and I absolutely love!

Once I heard this I was like wow this is extremely catchy, and I absolutely love how she sings this.  It's the shortest song on the album, coming in at a wopping 2 minuts and 46 seconds, but it is all good.  The song is fine just as it is, and I would add anything or take anything from it.<br /><br />I wish I knew(10/10)- This song sounds like she did a live performance on stage, and it is awsome!  I love live performances and that is why I absolutely love this song, it has beautiful lyrics and definately shows off mariah's strong sensual vocals, while she is hitting those hight Notes toward the end off the song..Definately one of the best from the Album.<br /><br />To The Floor(9/10)- This song really took time to grow on me!...I personally think Nelly is a little annoying, and it took me a good Two weeks to like this song, because I heard this song a month before the album came out, and I couldn't even listen to one bit of it, now it's a really awsome party song with a banging beat.  It is a really nice song, that will probably take some time for most people to like...Just give this one time, and you'll see how good this song is.  I also Love Mariah's high note at the end!<br /><br />Joy Ride(10/10)- Wow! This is avery nice song, that I heard almost didn't make it the album, I wonder why it wouldn't it is a very nice song, and a great song to fall asleep to, it is very sensual and strong and very nice lyics, and a great song, and I love mariah's long note at the end..it was superb!....Just Excellent!<br /><br />Fly Like a Bird(10/10)- This is a great way to end the Album,and let metell you, this is the best gospel song I ever heard..lol.  It is an excellent song, and very melodic and catchy.  An excellent song with Beautiful lyrics.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glenross istantly reminded me of Miller's Death Of A Salesman (for obvious reasons), the comparisons between the Shelley character and Willy Loman are particularly striking.    Glengarry Glenross is more of a snapshot than a composition, there is no engineered changing of mood or pace which would suit most dramas, it ends in a similiar way as it begins and this creates extraordinary realism which is very powerful. The characters are brilliant, the cast exists as one of the finest collection of actors you are ever likely to see in a movie, period. I'm not sure who's performance was best, Lemmon is scintillating as the insecure ageing salesman who's morals are being challenged by economic hardship. Spacey is at his very best as the harried and despised manager at the firm. Pacino probably just steals the show as the firms most successful salesman, the way he manipulates the timid client gives a hint into his dark side, his character is able to bypass any moral questions easily.    It is interesting to think about the film in terms of chronology, Lemon's character was 'once' a succesful salesman but no longer, he is surely what Pacino's character (currently successful) will one day be, Spacey's character only tolerates Pacino's verbal abuse because of Pacino's current success..'you fairy you', in a few years he will get his revenge as he does with Lemmon's character. Meanwhile Pacino's otherwise rough-edged character is strangely gentle and indulgent with Shelley, perhaps he also sees  himself in Shelley, twenty years older. The firm itself is a hot stew boiling over, there is constant pressure to perform constantly, and you are only as good as your last deal, is this turning them all into desperate crooks with no moral compass? The constant bickering between the characters betrays their unhappiness, the break-in at the firm betrays their moral decline, one character only (Pacino) seems to be thriving in the pressure cooker atmosphere and then only because ofhis amorality, the rest of them are unproductive unhappy employees. At one point in the movie an employee complains about how past mismanagement in the company has led to their current unprofitable situation epitomised by his clever line \\"you dont sell a man one car, you sell him 5 over fifteen years\\" - ie you dont screw your customer or he wont come back. The ultra-capitalist do-or-die attitude of their bosses is clearly failing on the business side of things as much as it is failing the employees, on a human level.    Best Line    \\"they're insane, they just like talking...to salesmen.\\"

0380002930|5.0|Watership Down, authored by the legendary Richard Adams is a masterpiece of human intellect, thoughts, and writing. This long (492 pages) yet fly-by book is full of action, courage, compassion, teamwork and friendship. The book starts with a clang of worrysome rabbits escaping their home-town burrow due to a virtual bunny-psychic having premonitions of something \\"bad\\". The group, headed by their pinnacle of a leader Hazel is soon on their way throughout the contryside. The \\"elements\\", death, which way to go, animals and the pounding thought of \\"is this worth it\\" linger around the clang of rabbits throughout the endeavour. The clang stumbles on other civilizations of rabbits, rivers and more but their spirits are boosted when they find an abandoned burrow they call the \\"Honeycomb\\" and their new home. They also have to fend off another civilization led by the sinister General Woundwart attacking their burrow and they meet a clumsy, stupid yet helpful seagull named Keehar. This stunning book is certainly enjoyable- as I've read it 3 times. This great novel has entertained millions of readers worldwide and will indefinately cntinue to do so for millions more. Ignore the uneducated common remarks of \\"Oh that book is SOOOOOO Boring\\", those people MUST have read a completely different book. Richard Adams uses great vocabulary from cover to cover. I have yet to read the sequel- Tails From Watership Down. Will it live up to the standard of its predecessor- only time will tell!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This album is awesome i never really cared for Mariah but when i 1st heard Its like that i was like shes a good singer and i started listening to all her old stuff and now i think i really like Mariah Carey! Well the tracks on this cd r pretty good my favorite is Track 2 we belong together..that song is the BESt..i can't stop listening to that track
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey's new album is probably one of the best she's ever delivered and arguably her strongest effort since her 90's hey-day. \\"Butterfly\\", released in 1997, is widely considered to be her artistic peak (up until now, that is) but ever since 1999's \\"Rainbow\\", the quality in her music decreased. The albums felt rushed, heavy with fillers and featured less than spectacular vocals. Carey was using her whispery voice in almost every song on albums like \\"Glitter\\" (2001) and \\"Charmbracelet\\". The public didn't buy it. They wanted the old Mariah. While \\"Charmbracelet\\" faired better than its predecessor, it failed to produce any considerable hits and was largely overlooked. And just when everyone was starting to question her future in music, the first single off her new album was sent to radio, \\"It's Like That\\". Radio was immediately embracing the song, and it quickly went top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. An incredible feat for an artist whom most people considered dead and buried. From now on, every thing would go smoothly for Mariah, just like in the old days. Just as her second single off the album began to burn the charts, the album was released to a huge media-blitz and as of now, rumored to sell around 350,000 copies in its first week. And with good reason. The album is filled with so many great songs. The production and vocal performance are top-notch. My personal favourites off the album include \\"We Belong Together\\" (mid-tempo ballad showcasing Mariah's extraordinary voice), \\"Stay The Night\\" (great production), and \\"Circles\\" (Mariah's voice absolutely soars on this one). Ladies & gentlemen, Mariah Carey is back. And she's here to stay. You can count on it.
0395645662|2.0|The plot for the book The Giver is very confusing. Their world in this book is all perfect and there is no crime or anything unusual. The beginning you really don't know what is going on because it kind of starts right in the middle of something. There world is totally black and white. The main character Jonas starts out as any normal boy would until the age of 12 when he gets the special job as the Receiver. This person receives all the memories from the people in the past. All the people in this book do not suffer any pain except the receiver. Everybody has the same exact feeling as everybody else and don't get to think for themselves.  <br />   The second reason is that the plot in this book is not a very interesting topic. This book doesn't grab your attention at all. It is all perfect so there is really no adventure in this book. There also isn't any action in it which makes this book even more boring. This book's plot isn't very thought out in my opinion because it is not very interesting and it is all perfect which makes the reader think the author didn't put much time into thinking the plot through by having the book all perfect. There is what I think about the plot of the book The Giver. <br />    So now that you know that this is a very bad book! I want to make sure that you don't waste  your well earned money. Thanks for reading about what I have to say about the plot of this book. <br />

6304936362|5.0|Yes, the boys that served in WW II came back a lot more mature than they went in - real MEN! <br /> <br />They faced a living Hell in that war and the Memphis Belle should be a medium to help us younger people appreciate what they suffered for us. <br /> <br />I have always felt a special affinity for the fly-boys and pray for them constantly - although thankfully I wasn't aware of what my uncles went through.  They were men that I admired. <br /> <br />How did they pull together this crew of actors to make such a moving tribute to our boys?  They did an excellent job of it.  <br />And Memphis Belle should be regarded a classis if not a part of our living history. <br /> <br />Let the young men of today [those stay at homes] see if they could fend any better. <br /> <br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED -- show it to the younger generation.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Will modern children like it?  This is a 50 year old Disney movie about <br />a divorced couple with  twins. The twins meet at camp and trade places. <br />The plot is classic, almost Shakespearean.  The actors are all better <br />than the Disney average.  The music, if you call Bobby Darren's work music, is <br />so dated that it sounds like a parody, but that will not be noticed by <br />the target audience, which is kids and nostologic oldsters. <br /> <br />   The 8 and 10 year old that watched it with me were literally bouncing <br />around the room since they found the film so funny and exciting that they <br />could not sit still. <br /> <br />   Well, that's the bottom line.  They insist it get 5 stars.  Anything more to be said? <br /> <br />   Yes. <br /> <br />   Those two kids are white, live with both their biological, married parents, and <br />have been brought up to believe that marriage is good, and divorce is bad.  They are <br />the optimal audience.  If that doesn't describe your kids, \\"The Parent Trap\\" is probably <br />not a good idea.  Movies like \\"The Parent Trap\\", provoked the making of \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", <br />which is usually floating around in Kid's Movieland.  If your kids have seen that, your <br />might want to show them \\"The Parent Trap\\" so that they can make some sense of the Robin <br />William's long weepy speeches there. <br /> <br />   One other yellow flag.  One of the marital problems, which in the end is just ignored, is <br />that the wife occasionally socks the husband in the eye.  This is not treated as a <br />physical abuse, or even a serious issue, and attributed to the wife's fiery Irish background, <br />signalled by red hair.  If your kids have had to deal seriously with this problem, this movie <br />might not be for you. Other stereotypes of the era are there as well.  Both husband and wife <br />are fabulously wealthy, dress up for dinner, and don't do any work.  There are plenty of loyal <br />domestic servants,but they are all white so the at least there is no \\"Mammy\\" problem with the <br />dialogue. <br /> <br />    This is a popular story and there have been many remakes, but all the ones I have seen <br />are terrible.  I am told that the \\"pre-remake\\", a 1950 BW German film, is quite charming, <br />but unless your kids are bilingual old-movie buffs, that's irrelevant.  What makes the remakes <br />terrible is what saves this work, which is that it is not a message movie, is not at all preachy, <br />and there are no moral lessons wrapped up in fake dialogue. <br /> <br />   This is a old fashioned Disney film, so there is none of the flatulence/groin humor <br />kids have come to expect from the Disney experience. <br /> <br />   The DVD is sharp and nice as far as the movie goes.  The controls follow the typical <br />Disney method:   Every time you put the dvd in the machine, they block your controls and <br />force you to watch a ream of advertisements before you can get to the main menu, where <br />'play' is down in the corner of the screen and hard to get to, so that if the kids make <br />a mistake they instead get the features, which are, of course, more advertisements.  Of <br />course, the 'play' key is blocked. <br />If you stop the film, that counts as if the dvd has been ejected, so when you restart you <br />have to watch all the advertisements again, as well as the charming FBI warning threatening <br />you with not only a 250K fine but 3 years in jail.  For kids movies this is a especial pity, <br />since they will typically watch the same movie many times, and so are stuck not only watching <br />long loud advertisements in a movie they own, but the same ones, over and over and over. <br />You might want to spare them the pain and make a videotape of just the movie for day to day <br />watching.  (Ask you teenagers how to do that.) <br />[Of course, the other studios are doing the same things, but Disney's are noticeably worse.]
B000067G3C|5.0|Dennis Hopper was a great villian - he sure kept us on the run. <br /> <br />Jack [K. Reeves] was hard put but ready to outsmart the bomber. <br />Sandra got better after a couple of stiff lines.  She was great with all that yelling. <br /> <br />I didn't appreciate the bomb squad getting blown to smithereens but that was the story. [Jeff Daniels] part deserved better. <br /> <br />It still with all of its action and fast paced story line should become a \\"Classic\\" - it rates as one to be watched over and over again.  This has been my 4th or 5th time already. <br /> <br />I sure wouldn't want to be caught having to jump a bus into space - landing would be just too uncertain. <br /> <br />Great tension - excellent acting on all parts - especially the bus passengers.  And how about the police co-ordinating the rescues?  Who was the flat-bed driver? <br /> <br />Well I will be ready to watch it again this fall. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --
B0000AZAUM|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THAT I listen and Owning even on hybrid SACD, This should be another thing to own too. But the only thing not good is they need to make a special edition of one f the best albums but i dont care if they did, this will cost 14 more dollars of the regular price, because the sound format if they make it hydrid or with bonus tracks or a Deluxe Edition. This version is all right, and my fav songs are Ziggy Stardust, actually all of the whole album. The note is THIS ALBUM NEED TO BE PLAYED AT MAXUMUM VOLUME, Of corse this great album needs to be played at maxumum volume. I recomend this album for everybody, even this version, if you like ultra sound, new sound, the sound that was to me meant to be sound if you play it on a SACD/DVD/CD Player. With 5.1 surround System with speakers it will sound like they where making the album or they where playing in your house. Buy this album no matter is you a begginer fan or a hardcore fan of David Bowie, buy this album. If you had this album. Listen to the SACD version. Sounds awosome
B0007GAERG|5.0|I personally love Mariah's CD.  I read other reviews, mostly people who didn't like the CD.  The main complaint was that the music isn't like the \\"Old Mariah.\\"  While I agree that the songs aren't classic Mariah but times have changed and so has Mariah.  She still has an amazing voice and she still comes out with great songs but people can't expect her to be singing the same songs that she used to in the beginning of her career.  The music world is so pop related and Mariah is trying to reinvent herself and branch off into different areas.  I give her credit for putting out a great cd.  It's a great mix of hip hop beats and slow ballads.  One of the few \\"real\\" singers left.
B000002KN8|5.0|This is the only Depeche Mode album I own.  Why?<br /><br />One, because it's fun, catchy stuff, and, despite its bubble-gum aura, if you listen closely you see some really interesting production going on by Vince Clark.  Turn up the bass, and the songs suddenly become more serious and less bubble-gum once the beat gets thumping.  Lyrics?  Personally, I don't care.<br /><br />Two, because, IMHO, after this album Depeche Mode went downhill in a MAJOR way.  They tried so hard to be &#34;cool&#34; and &#34;deep&#34; that much of their music just got boring, and, paradoxically, lost its soul.<br /><br />Some tracks on this album don't do it for me, but there are so many gems (e.g. New Life, Dreaming of Me, Just Can't Get Enough, Tora! Tora! Tora!) that I consider it a must-have.<br /><br />I have to agree with J.Brady above that if you're going to buy this, you MUST get the import.  The import has everything on the American release plus 5 extra tracks, most of which are great.  The import has better sound quality to boot.  But most importantly, the import has both versions of &#34;Just Can't Get Enough,&#34; whereas the American release only has the junk Schizo Mix.<br /><br />A warning, though, for die-hard DM collectors: some of the tracks common to both releases are mixed slightly differently on each release, e.g. &#34;New Life.&#34; So, die-hard fans would have to buy both releases, I guess. For anyone else, however, I'd say buy the import &#34;+5&#34; and forget about the American release!
B0007NFL18|4.0|This cd is pretty good and an excellent follow up to his first cd.
B0000029DD|5.0|Let me explain to the people who don't get this album why they don't get it. Jeff Buckley believed the voice was capable of delivering the emotional content of the song irrespective of the lyrics and melody. Even though on this record I believe these to be outstanding in their own right. Through his daily study of Sufi music he appreciated what certain frequencies could do to the heart and soul. There is a very deep undercurrent to this record that you will not necessarily get on first few listens. The magic of this record is that it is a grower. Like a fine wine it keeps getting better. This record resonates in my body much like Nusrut Fateh Ali Khan must of resonated in Jeffs. He listened to the guy religiously. Jeff buckley could translate emotion into his voice like so few artists can do. You can taste the experience. Feel it wash over you and transport you to a place. Jeff buckleys voice is a very powerful spiritual instrument. This album is a beautiful hypnotism. It is much deeper than most people realise. If you want to understand how Jeff achieved this the best place to look is Sufi music. The frequencies used is this record open up a world within the listening that they had perhaps lost for a while. So its like finding a lost child. If you still don't get it you are spiritually lost at sea.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Picked up the CD today...and briefly scanned it...been a big fan of her heartfelt ballads and  was hoping that there would be more of these...a return to what she was when she started out. Sadly it's lacking in that department. If you like the new flavor of Mariah with her posse of Rap artists...then you'll surely like this. I can usually take or leave it...usually just leave it...but it's like that.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Michael, Michael, Michael. Who are you really? An overblown American icon who has figured out a lucrrative niche and exploits it to the max? A true believer who wants a better world? You hype one thing and do another. Do you help the cause of peace or do you merely use it for your own benefit. You are angry at Bush but you wouldn''t mind us fighting the \\"right\\" war! You find a soft spot and make a big movie out of it while stuffing your belly and your pockets. I am so upset at you.You aren't sincere. You are an entertainer, No different than any of the Right Wing clowns who dance on the media stage. Stop pretending to be the real thing while making millions with the \\"oh poor me\\" publicity stunts. You have so much access, do something truthful with it!
B000001DVD|5.0|Pyromania comes in at a close second, but High N' Dry is one of those hidden gems you just don't hear much about.<br /><br />High N' Dry captures the early rawness of Def Leppard in their growing stage, and in their most exciting form. All of the guitars are raw, defined, and heavy. The solos cut through like a hot knife through butter, and with each snap of the snare drum, you're tempted to get up and bang your head to the music.<br /><br />John Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange did such a stellar job on producing and engineering this album. It's too bad that Def Leppard had to change their musical style to the pop-candy rock that you hear on the radio so often these days.<br /><br />This is the Def Leppard you don't hear anymore. Pick this album up now.
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story told through Scout (Jean Louise)'s young eyes. She lives in Alabama with her 13-year-old brother, Jem, and her father, Atticus. Jem and Scout spend their summers playing with their friend, Dill, and trying to be brave enough to get Boo Radley, their odd neighbor, to come out of his house - they have never even seen the man. The following fall, Atticus, who is a lawyer, takes on a case defending a black man, Tom Robinson, accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. During everything taking place before the trial, Atticus tries to teach his children about true courage and not to judge anyone else until they've walked a day in the other person's shoes. <br /> <br />I would give To Kill a Mockingbird an 8 out of 10 because although it is an easy book to read and is pretty short, it's packed full of characters that, although they are basically good people at heart, are constantly being challenged to show their goodness to their neighbors, whether they be black or white. This story challenges the reader to rethink prejudices and judgments that adults so easily pass on others and instead view everyone with the innocent eyes of a child.
B000001F7R|2.0|On Through The Night is a mixed bag, and opinions vary greatly on this album. It can either leave you breathless or it can leave you feeling empty and cheated of your fifteen dollars.<br /><br />The supposed \\"loyal\\" fans will tell you that this is the best Def Leppard album of all time, and that without it, your ears will perish in no time, so for God sakes, do it for your ears, man!<br /><br />The average fan, like me, will tell you that it was a good album to get the ball rolling, but it certainly does not hold a candle to their later releases. It lacks in many areas but still sounds good enough to lend an ear once in awhile.<br /><br />The nu-Lep fan (yes, that's my term...like it?) on the other hand will tell you that this album is complete garbage, and that \\"Promises, Paper Sun, Slang, and anything from 'X' is so much better than this\\".<br /><br />You've gotta decide where you fit in. I've basically listed every opinion that you'll hear on this review page just in one single review. Decide which genre of fan applies to you most, and make a decision.<br /><br />I myself, being an average Lep fan will give this CD a spin on a hot summer day if I'm not doing much else. I would much rather listen to High N' Dry, Pyromania, or Hysteria, but sometimes a change is good. This album is what it's worth. Give it a try and find out for yourself!
0792838068|3.0|I am probably one of the few reviewers who actually has mixed feelings about this one. Most people either hate or love this movie. Personally the acting by Elizabeth Shue is good I think Nicholas Cage's role was very overrated. I don't see how you could honestly say that playing an alcoholic is very difficult. Majority of the movie he is either drunk or passed out. The most ridiculous part is that he won an oscar! Sad but true. Basically Nicholas Cage's life comes crashing down on him as his wife and kids dis-own him, on top of that he loses his job. As a result, Nicholas Cage Wants to escape from his L.A. life by going to Las vegas to \\"drink himself to death.\\" On his way to Vegas he meets a prostitute, Elizabeth Shue who leads a sad life and is very lonely. Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue both have serious problems but they some how get around that and start to have feelings for each other. They both realize that they have serious issues but they don't care to mention any of that to each other. They respect each others life styles. In general Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue play very weak characters, I mean I think there are other people in the world who have had worse problems in their life and turned it around. Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue pretty much give up on life. Elizabeth Shue never quits selling her body, and Nicholas Cage never quits \\"Drinking himself to Death.\\" Like I said I liked Elizabeth Shue's acting and the story line was somewhat decent. I wouldn't call the movie terrible. I just don't see how HollyWood could blow up and hype such a movie, not to mention Nicholas Cage winning an oscar, if anything it should of went to Elizabeth Shue even though she was nominated. Im no actor, but I can assure you fans of this movie or even people that hate this movie that I could of easily played a guy who passes out most of the movie and act incredibly stupid. That is what Nicholas Cage does pretty much the whole movie, he doesn't really portray any real quality acting. The movie is deff. worth checking out no doubt about it but I personally thought HollyWood pumped this movie up way too much, and hyped Nicholas Cage's role as \\"Stunning,\\" or \\"amazing\\".
B0007CNXUK|5.0|As an Actor Johnny is one of the best.  This was a wonderful fun story about a man and his muses.  The young actor who played Peter was just adorable plus I just love movies that make me cry.  Weird I know.  After the movie, I, too did a little bit of research and was disappointed on how much of the story was ficitionalized and vastly disappointed to learn what truely became of the children.
B00006IU73|5.0|I am a die hard PT fan, and In Absentia is my favorite album of theirs to date (however the upcoming Deadwing may take its place). Dont get me wrong, I love almost all of their previous music, but In Absentia just takes you on a musical journey unlike anything in today's mainstream. The opener, Blackest Eyes, is perhaps my favorite song of all time. The heavy riffs, the catchy melodies, the perfect lyrics, all make this one a charm. In my opinion, there is not one bad track on this album. Truly underrated, and awe inspiring!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|It's always troubling to watch the games people play.  As much as you want to declare that these people just have problems and move on there is more than a healthy dose of reality.  For me Clive Owens and Natalie Portman stole the show and truely earned their Oscar nominations.  I expected more out of Roberts and pretty much felt Law was the same character we met in I heart Hucklebees and that Captain Tomorrow thingy.  The script was disturbingly brilliant and even manages to pull off a final surprise at the end.  Recommended but not to the faint at heart.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The album de-loused in the coma torium or as I interprut it scorn and dissapproving in the coma-torium. Warns us in a very poetic, schizophrenic way that the direction our society and nation is headed is all too full of horrors. Frazes like \\"Trans-oceanic death to this world\\", \\"and mid night nuses in box car cadavers\\" are all too distrubingly show what the lead singer thinks our world is moving towards.         I interprut the box car cadavers as meaning automobiles will be our true coffins.         The albuum is filled with powerful vocal poetic imagry.    Then it is backed up with some of the best guitar riffs I've ever heard. This is Jazz rock fusion reinvented with frenzied latin beats behind it. Guitars layered over guitars with unique harmanies and textures followed with jams that take you on musical highs and lows. The amazing this is some guitar riffs are so obscure and a tonal that you forget them the next minute. But some riffs are so catchy they shall stick with you through ou the week.      Of course it features 2 members from at the drive-in I'm sure you know that. You may even know their names. I just call them the 2 guys with the afro's. The drumming is intense and the bass playing does not lack at all with a guest preformance by flea (yeah I guess).       This album was a bit too intense for me at first because of the emotion behind it. As well as the non-stop rockingness of the album. It was just a sensory overload. But of course now it is one of my favorite albums.         oh yea and I don't suggest their newest cd Frances the Mute. All that jamming on tour must have burnt them out or something cause its not soo good. Maybe 2 stars.          So if you like experimental music that sounds like nothing else buy this album.
B00080ZG10|4.0|This is the first Scorses film I've actually enjoyed.  I still have nightmares of the Gangs of New York. (What was that?)  Anyway, Leo shows he still has great acting chops (Basketball Diaries, Gilbert Grape) and let's not forget the wonderful Cate Blanchet.  Yet, I did find myself glancing at my watch more than once and I wasn't too thrill with the editing in the last ten to fifteen minutes of the film.  But it is a big story, great vision, and it was well executed.
B0007GAERG|1.0|\\"ITS LIKE THAT Y'ALL!!!\\"...that's what came blaring out of my TV when I happened to channel surf to BET one evening. Just like rumors of the apocolypse, I began hearing about Crazy Carey's publicity machine starting up again; now it is in full gear.  <br /> <br />Madison Ave. and the recording industry are well aware that anything can sell if you hype it enough, so I am not surprised that they have thrust onto the public stage such a blatently bad CD. This stuff is truly awful: bad lyrics (like that y'all), forgettable melodies and Crazy Carey's Banshee-frightening screeching throughout the whole mess. To make things \\"better\\", Crazy's handlers teamed her up with the latest crop of popular rappers to add some more youth appeal to this aural assault. So this toxic CD is basically bad music and Crazy Carey's dog-killing squealing with \\"Yo\\", \\"Y'all\\" and \\"Uh-uh!\\" tracks thrown in on top.  <br /> <br />But you know what, it won't affect sales one bit. People who like Brittany/Christina/Jessica's type of caterwauling will eat this CD up; and that is \\"Emancipation\\"'s target audience. To those tone-deaf people I say try listening to real music once in a while, made by real musicians. Then maybe, one day, we will be free from torture like \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\".
B0002VKZL6|5.0|MK is a great artist. Through his past career he was not what you might call a 'mainstream' artist. I think this is an attempt at getting into mainstream music. I give this CD an A+.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Look, it's often cheesy, contrived, and poorly edited. Sappy as hell, too- but god help me, I love this show. Part of it's the nostalgia, part of it's Richard Dean Anderson (who has a sly sense of humor about himself that helps to smooth over some of the flaws), but mostly, I think, it's getting to watch a show that revels in its lead's intelligence. Too often we're told that brute strength is the only way to be a \\"real man,\\" the only way to be the sort of hero anybody can look up to; to get someone who succeeds because he's clever and reads a lot- that's just too cool for school. <br /> <br />The kid I was loved it. I'm just glad that the (sort of) grown-up me loves it just as much.
B0007GAERG|4.0|The Emancipation of Mimi is not perfect, but is by far the best Mariah Carey album in a good many years.  The album is full of classic Mariah songs all of which could turn into radio hits - if radio is smart enough to play them.  \\"It's Like That\\" received good airplay so the chances are good.  Songs like \\"Say Somethin\\" and \\"To The Floor\\" could definitely blaze up the charts.  Reccomended for fans and nonfans.
B00005JNTV|5.0|The dialogue can get damn cheesy.  The actors can get canned hammy.    For all the action/sci-fi movies that choke themselves on such things, Sin City tosses a salad and kisses with tongue.    It will appeal to the juvenile and anti-social, but it will give them higher standards.
0142000663|5.0|\\"Wow, This book is boring\\"--Thats what I was like after reading this book for 1 hour (I only got 17 pages read). The beginning of this book isn't that great, but trust me, it becomes more interesting and you start to get pulled  into the book. Steinbeck does a good job of holding the readers attention after like the first 50 pages of the book. You learn history, and you get a great novel ALL IN ONE! People, I urge you to read this book, do not be afraid of the first 50 pages (they will lead you to the good part). Oh yeah, if you liked this book after reading it, read Of Mice and Men (its even better in my opinion).
B0007GAERG|5.0|This Cd is off the hook. I have to admitt I was getting pretty tired of the weak sounds, but this time around she came hard. I was not so crazy about it's like that, but the other tracks made up for it. I have always loved when Mariah sang in a quick flow. This time she does it, and brings lots of different harmonies together. \\"Shake it off\\", and \\"One and only\\" would have to be voted the best, although Joy ride, and the others are quite equal.  <br /> <br />
B0007CNXUK|4.0|Whatever involves you, involves your emotions. Whatever involves you in Peter Pan, involves you in Barrie's emotions. Many of those are happy, but some are not simple things.<br /><br />As with any of Depp's movies, this one admits of many readings. The first story is on the surface: Barrie befriends a family in harsh straits, and they inspire him to stories that live far beyond their intended audience.<br /><br />Another reading finds Barrie as the eternal child, never really at home in the adult person. He just wants to do whatever he does best, even if the grownups (like him, sort of) don't get it. Yet another, grimmer view of this story finds much to question in this man's fascination with little boys, an echo of Lewis Carroll's dark side.<br /><br />All the levels present themselves at once - maybe more than once, as scenes keep coming back to the viewer, even days later. It's a well-made movie, and an emotionally powerful one (if that's what you want). It's an uplifting view of the finest flower of loving creativity, but carries a waft of the manure around its roots.<br /><br />It also has a number of scenes that conspicuously jerk at one's tears. Some of them even work. They're not the ones I remember later, though.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002BPS|5.0|First of all I have to say it's a one of kind album. One of the best they made in the 90's. When I first listened to the Tape <BR>( didn't have a CD Walkman at the lol!)it was pretty amazing  the feelings, and emotions of lyrics. The best song on the Tape - was &quot; The meaning of life.&quot;
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Fantastic movie. Although made on a low budget, it combine fantastically unrealistic characters and makes the film into a lovable sequence of hilarious events. Highlights include: the Uncle Rico sequences; when he first meets Deb selling beadwork so she can go to college (your mom goes to college!); and very best the ending dance sequence. It has also sparked many catchphrases repeately heard around the high school, including \\"Whatever I want, gosh!\\" and \\"Tina, you fat tub of lard, get some food!\\".        Along these lines, I also think that this film provides an intersting look on society in general. After I saw this movie, I went to school one day and saw the star football player and the blond cheerleader going down the hall saying \\"Frickin Idiot\\" and other miscallaneous ND sayings, and I just thought \\"This is the most ironic thing that I've ever seen. These popular kids are quoting quotes from a movie all about nerds getting beaten up and made fun of every day, and they think it's cool. meanwhile, in the same school, I can name 2 or 3 kids that are being bullied and harrassed right now.\\" I think that this shows how some people can think that they believe in a subject or idea, but it turns out that they are just pretending. These homecoming king and queen don't care about the nerds at my school-they just like watching people like them in movies. Also, some of these reviews say things like \\"After I saw the movie the 4th time, it started to get old\\" Well duh. Then they would give the movie a 2 and write it off as another stupid comedy, when it is actually a fantastic work of art.
B000000W5L|5.0|The weird thing about this album is that there aren't any hits on this album, but every song is awesome.  I guess some songs can stand on their own, but sit down and play the whole thing from start to finish to really get the most.  If you ever wanted to know why the Stones are the greatest band of all time, get this CD now.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yes, its been awhile since MC has had a good CD, but she's back, and let me tell you, this CD is not weak, there are NO fillers, every song is good, trust this.

B0007P3582|1.0|LETS B 4real. 50 Cent is a one album wonder. his name is selling this album because it surely isn't the music. I really didn't like his first one. 75% of his new cd sounds like something he has done before, 4 Ex: Disco Inferno sounds just like On Fire by Lloyd Banks or In the Club. Candy Shop Sounds just like Magic Stick By Lil Kim and Him. I really don't understand the hype. he talks about rappers he has no chance at being better than. Get over you self 50 you garbeg!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006IIKS0|2.0|As far as the documentary is concerned I think the DVD was made very well. It shows all different aspects of the band and you really get the feeling that the band has forgotten about the cameras and crew. What is really disapointing about this DVD is the band themselves. When did they become such losers ?? Kirk is the only one left in the band who makes any sense. Too bad he's such a wuss that he lets the other three (bob, james, and lars) make all of his decisions for him. All this DVD really did was make me dislike what these a-holes have become even more. I wish they could go back in time and see themselves twenty years ago as compared to now. They remind me of the old rich lady at Neiman Markus walking around with her poodle in her arms talking about how she's late for her therapy..Get a grip you bums. While the rest of us are working fourty to fifty hours a week just trying to make ends meet, these idiots are crying how they can't work together anymore and how much they don't know each other, blah..blah...blah... It make me sick to my stomach. How they expected the average Joe to relate to this DVD is beyond me. All I could do was watch in disgust as a bunch of forty something rich guys cry like babies over every aspect of there existance..I guess it's true that money really doesn't buy happiness.. Oh yeah, this DVD is way too long and unless your a Metallica fanatic keep your money in your pocket. I'm sure VH1 ill play this a hundred times more anyway. Don't give any more $ to these losers...
B0007GAERG|4.0|After Glitter i thought she would never recover. But she did. She had a bange with charmbraclet and now another with Emancipation Of Mimi i really enjoted listen to the album. For a person who only started listen to Mariah when she got in touch with her hip hop side, i think this is one of her best cds.
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey's fifth album \\"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea\\" is the singer/songwriter's finest album and should please fans of her older albums and new fans alike. \\"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea\\" is somewhat slicker, less rough-around-the-edges than her other albums. I would recommend this album to start off with, as it is probably her most assessable work.<br /><br />I personally feel that this album has her best collection of songs. From the opening rocker \\"Big Exit\\" to the beautiful \\"We Float,\\" every song is a winner. There isn't any filler to be found. Each song is well written and memorable. It's a good mix of fast paced rockers, mid-tempo songs, and slower ones. The listener never gets bored. This CD deals with themes of love, relationships, etc, but never gets tedious or trite. Everything on this album is sincere and straight from the heart.<br /><br />The album opens up strong with \\"Big Exit\\" an excellent rocker with a good, infectious hook. \\"Good Fortune\\" keeps up the momentum. \\"A Place Called Home\\" is a beautiful, somewhat morose, slower number whose enchanting background vocals stay with the listener long after the song has ended. The album slows down a bit for the next few songs. The mid-tempo \\"One Line\\" leads in perfectly to the dark, atmospheric \\"Beautiful Feeling.\\" The pace is picked up with \\"The Whores Hustle, and the Hustlers Whore.\\" \\"The Mess We're In\\" features a duet with Thom Yorke. Their overlapping vocals work nicely together. \\"You Said Something\\" is another softer number in the vein of \\"A Place Called Home,\\" only slightly more upbeat. The pace picks up considerably with the excellent rockers \\"Kamikaze\\" and \\"This is Love.\\" The album starts to wind down with the beautiful \\"Horses in my Dreams\\" The duel piano and guitar make \\"Horses in my Dreams\\" enchanting. The album ends with its' finest track, the majestic \\"We Float.\\" The verse serves mostly to build up the song and it's mesmerizing chorus totally engulfs the listener.<br /><br />If you don't own any PJ Harvey albums, this is a good place to start. It's a really good album and should please old and new fans alike.ner.  <br /> <br />If you don't own any PJ Harvey albums, this is a good place to start.

B000060P79|1.0|I hate bands like this. They're the type of guys who are convincing 12-15 year old girls everywhere that dying your hair and wearing a studded belt makes you punk. They're no better than Blink 182, Good Charlotte, and Yellowcard. If you looked up the word \\"posers\\" in the dictionary, you'd find a picture of these bands next to the definition.<br /><br />One of the reasons fans of Simple Plan will always use to back up why they like them is \\"because you can relate to them!\\". No sh*t, Sherlock. When you write the songs directly FOR your target audience (which is kinda sad when you think about it), they're OBVIOUSLY gonna be able to relate to it. These guys are, what? 25? And they're still acting like a bunch of 13 year olds. Come on. Just take a look at song titles like \\"The Worst Day Ever\\", \\"I'm Just A Kid\\", and \\"God Must Hate Me\\", and tell me how you can possibly take this band seriously.<br /><br />News flash: YOUR LIFE IS NOT WORSE THAN EVERYONE ELSES. In Africa, there are people who have AIDS and kids who are starving to death, and in Iraq, there are soldiers who are going out there and getting their limbs blown off; putting their lives at risk everyday in order to keep us safe, and all you can do is whine about how \\"My parents hate me, School sucks, I wanna go home!\\".<br /><br />I think in the end, though, it's just the bad quality of the music that explains why I hate this band. Their lead singer's voice sounds just like every pop-punk singer out there (maybe even worse), the guitars are repetetive and unimaginative, and the only one who really seems to have any skill is the drummer.<br /><br />I'm not really a punk fan or anything, but if you want real punk, you should check out The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, Black Flag, and The Misfits. Each one of them is infinitely better than this cap.
B0008JFMEC|5.0|This movie is freaking great and whats better is that it's coming for the psp so now you can watch it anywhere you go.
B000088E6D|5.0|This CD is one of the greatest CD's I have ever owned. If you are a fan on the Classic Crooners like Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, or Gene Kelly, you will adore Michael Bubl! His renditions of \\"FEVER\\", \\"THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT\\", and \\"THAT'S ALL\\" are sure to give you goose bumps with the smooth mellow sound of his voice. \\"SWAY\\" will make you want to get up and dance all over the room. He is definitely a rare talent in this day and age. He has easily won a place in my heart as my newest favorite singer! And he is as easy on the eyes as he is the ears!!
B00004REF1|5.0|The proformances are just great and wicked in a good way.Especially Sarah Michelle Gellar who put the best proformance in the whole movie.This movie is about sex and betrayal and also very wickedly funny. NOT FOR KIDS buy it now and I promise your love it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Raise your hand if you like Sum41, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and some other of those types of bands (I can't name anymore because I don't pay attention to that garbage).  If you raised your hand, there's a 87 percent chance I hate you as much as I hate that shallow kiddie punk rock.  Radiohead is a band that more of us intellectual folks listen to and enjoy.  If you like to listen to quality, deep, complex music, this album is perfect for you.  If at first listen it doesn't appeal to you, keep on listening.  This music will grow on you by the 3rd or 4th listen, and when you understand the music, you will find that other music just seems plain in contrast with Radiohead.   <br />Holler back.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|When Everwood came out I didn't see it because I thought it would be another 7th heaven,but I decided to give the show a chance and Im happy that I did.This show is great in every way the proformances are great especially Gregory Smith and Treat Williams.The supporting cast is great too. Trust me buy this show now every minute of you watching it won't waste the time in your life.
B00005MEPV|5.0|Ce Star Wars peu décevoir plus d'un fan mais il reste que ce film ne fait qu'introduire les personnages comme tel et il est certain que le son infernal de la respiration de Darth Vader peu manquer à plus d'un mais on y gagne avec un méchant que je trouve particulièrement charismatique bien qu'il meurt de façon très chiante.<br />Un Star Wars très critiqué mais c'est ce qui s'est passé avec l'ancienne trilogie durant son époque! :p
B0007GAERG|3.0|I agree with prior review - Mariah is bomb diggity.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say she's hot diggity, dog diggity, boom what you  do to me.    But bombs, dogs, and diggitys aside, this album proves once again, Mariah should be covered in ketchup, mustard, and onions and served on a fresh bun.    I also agree with above reviewer.  Mariah has laid waste to the competition for years - UNtreated, human waste, that is.    14 stars.
6305696071|1.0|I am a big Gere fan but I wish that this movie would stay on the shelf!  It gives young and naive people a totally wrong picture of what prostitution is.  This movie really sets the cause of women behind about 150 years.  Besides that, the dialogue is very weak and there's not much of a story.
B000683VI4|5.0|I've had people tell me they didn't want to watch this movie due to the fact that it's a \\"Chick flick\\".  I'm here to tell you that this movie is oh so much more then that.  It is a movie about life and love that lasts a lifetime!<br /><br />For the record, of the people who told me they wouldn't watch this movie, I got two of them to watch it with me.  One has a new favorite movie and it is this one.  The other buried his head under his shirt to hide his crying at the end.<br /><br />More often then not, the book is so much better then the movie version.  But in this case, I've got to say that although I did enjoy the book, the movie is by far better.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were fabulous; I am very much looking forward to seeing them in other movies now.  Of course James Garner and Gena Rowlands were wonderful too.
B00005JKG5|1.0|I watched this movie in the 80s in the theatre and loved it.  Maybe it was partially because I was a teenager and had stars in my eyes.  Until recently, thinking about the movie gave me happy thoughts of being young and imagining that I was a dancer.  Then I watched the movie again and it struck me as being terrible!  It may mostly be that it hasn't aged very well.  But, I also think that it's just not a very good movie.  It strikes me as the kind that was perhaps made for the interest of teenaged boys!  I found it to be a big disappointment.
0596009208|5.0|This is a very good book to begin learning web tier of J2EE. It builds gradually on a concepts in a friendly and funny way. It starts with the fundamentals and prods you to think about the advanced concepts and then delves in them to sufficient detail. Mock exam questions test the topics discussed and also prepare you for the SCBCD exam if you plan to appear for one.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Awesome Mariah! It normally takes me about a month or so to really catch onto songs on new CD's. I bought the Emancipation of Mimi on a leap of faith. I liked \\"We Belong Together\\" alot as well as \\"It's Like That\\". Let me assure you that the rest of the CD does NOT disappoint. Some of my other favorites are the Kanye West produced \\"Stay the Night\\". It features a chill, classic Kanye sound, with amazing vocals. I love \\"Say Something\\", produced by the Neptunes and featuring Snoop. The beat and background music is unlike anything I ever heard, but listen to it twice and it will be in your head, and you'll never want to get it out. \\"Mine Again\\" is one of those signature Mariah ballads with a bit of a jazzy/soul feeling to it. Mariah herself said that she felt that her voice was in the best place ever when she recorded the CD, and there's nothing on here that would make you believe otherwise. Especially on \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" her vocals are impeccable. I'm excited that she has returned back to her normal self, after the over-the-top \\"Charmbracelet\\". This feels like such a classic CD, and it sounds like it in so many ways. Don't miss out on the Emancipation!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Much as it pains me to say it, this album is a distinct falling off from Michael Bubl's debut disc.  <br />Once again he covers all too often, not just his idols' songs, but even their arrangements -- including one of the most legendary, the Nelson Riddle setting for Sinatra's \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\" I'd prefer to hear Bubl update the standards, not just echo them. But much more troubling, Bubl seldom sings with the sustained open tone and long line that made his earlier performances such a delight. Still, don't let this keep you from catching Bubl live. That's where he's always been at his best.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Those familiar with Nora Jones smooth, easy, flowing voice need no prompt or push to hear this CD, it's a continuation of her beautiful voice & music and an enjoyable ride- thank you, again, Ms Jones!<br /><br />For a good review with background on Ms Jones, see the lengthy review here: \\"The Miseducation of Ms Shankar\\". Strange title, but interesting notes such as: that Nora Jones is the daughter of the famous Indian Sitar player, Ravi Shankar. With genes and upbringing like that, no wonder Nora has such a beautiful disposition that flows through her music!

B0007M22TI|5.0|The visual effect of this DVD is strikingly beautiful.  Unfortunately, the sound seems shallow and in some cases has some static on the high notes.  The CD version has wonderful sound, though.  I recommend that interested parties buy both the DVD and the CD.

B00006LWSF|5.0|How Eminem was able to pull out a well organized album after a box office hit is incredible. First is first, the songs on this CD has a little bit of everything. Not a hip-hop fan? You're ok, this cd contains a couple songs by non-rappers. Into hip-hop? Has many artists from Eminem's label as well as other great rappers such as Jay-Z, Nas and Rakim. I would have to say that this was above my expectations and is a must if you're a hip-hop/eminem fan. He rips it up in Love me, 8 Mile road, 8 miles and runnin', and rabbit run. As well as other songs. But these i have to say were my favorite. Get the CD, i promise it won't be a dissapointment.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I heard that the Band that sang at Franks wedding reception is an actual band that sings at weddings. I wanted to find out the name of the band and see if they had a CD I could buy. Any info would help.
B000777J2S|5.0|I will say up front that I am not a fan of \\"technically great\\" voices per se; the ability of any singer to perform vocal gymnastics is to me largely irrelevant in pop music (in opera, it is largely required). What does matter is the ability to covey feelings and urgency, and to do so in a way that invites the listener to see his or her place in the described world. Whether it is Jeff Buckley (huge voice) or Bob Dylan (raveged and wheezy voice) the question is always: \\"Did I feel that one?\\" <br /> <br />So my collection is full of all sorts of songs and singers - some polished, some rough, some quiet and some shouting. All the ones I love deliver on that bottom line of human experience. They may or may not write their own songs - that is a different point entirely. <br /> <br />That being said, Antony must now be counted among those flawed and beautiful voices. Even if he had not penned the songs on \\"I Am a Bird Now\\", I would still have to give it a big thumbs-up for delivery. Passionate, believing and wanting us to believe, Antony \\"sells it\\" perfectly. The sparse arrangements give the voice top billing. <br /> <br />Now add to the mix his history, the artwork of the album (which speaks volumes about the lost world he laments) and his songwriting, and it goes right over the top. While the androgyny is something most of us will not have experienced first hand, it doesn't matter. Love, loss, fear of death, the beauty of friendships - these things hit us all, no matter what our bent. <br /> <br />This one hit me right away, and will spend a long time on my playlists for certain. Superb.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|Ray Charles was a first-rate musician.  He could make music!  But this CD, in general, is not a joy to hear.  First (through no fault of his own--he was very sick, after all), Charles' voice sounds very weak and strained here.  One can still hear evidence of his outstanding talent, but it is very diminished.  Second, most of the song selections were not well-advised.  I love James Taylor, for example, but not that song, and certainly not in duet with Ray Charles.  Similar comment can be made about many of the other songs and singers.  Two or three of the tracks are excellent, however, particularly Charles' respective duets with Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, and Johnny Mathis.  In my opinion, those three tracks alone are worth the purchase price (while most of the others I probably will skip in future).  Also (for you audiophiles), the recording-quality varies from track to track; sometimes it is very good, but mostly it is merely adequate.
B00006FR47|5.0|Great tunes, tight arrangements, killer playing, and a band at its best: these are the elements of CHICAGO V.  As (arguably) my favorite Chicago release, the recent Rhino remaster is very much welcome. <br /> <br />Recorded in just 8 days in 1972, CHICAGO V showcases the elements that made Chicago great.  To begin with, tunesmith Robert Lamm is at the top of his game here, contributing the vast majority of the songs.  Secondly, the horn arrangements (mostly by James Pankow) rip.  And finally, guitarist Terry Kath blisters across the canvass. <br /> <br />The set opens with the jam, \\"A Hit by Varese.\\"  The horns trade solos over a sophisticated backbeat and the result is an experimental tune that just makes for great listening.  The follw-up, \\"All Is Well,\\" features gorgeous vocal harmonies. <br /> <br />Slamming drums open Pankow's excellent rocker \\"Now That You've Gone\\" with a lead vocal growled by Kath and a closing Walt Parazaider alto solo that builds to a frenzied climax.  \\"Dialogue\\" features great Kath/Pete Cetera vocal interplay and counter-culture commentary dressed up in a catchy melody.  \\"While the City Sleeps\\" does much the same with a more straightforward rock beat. <br /> <br />\\"Saturday in the Park\\" is the big hit here, and it's rare to find a pop tune so well crafted.  Lamm sings it, and well.  The rocker \\"State of the Union\\" (featuring a Lee Loughnane trumpet solo) is followed up by the sweeping \\"Goodbye,\\" effectively sung by Cetera (and again featuring a Lougnane trumpet solo).  The original closer, Kath's \\"Alma Mater,\\" is a nostalgic tune with a nice chord progression and, in all, leaves the listener with a good feeling. <br /> <br />Being a reissue, there are bonus tracks.  In this case, there's a \\"vocal-less\\" version of Lamm's \\"A Song for Richard and His Friends\\" (never one of my favorites), and an early version of Kath's \\"Mississippi Delta City Blues\\" (which appears in its definitive version on CHICAGO XI).  Both are certainly listenable.  The final track is the single-edit of \\"Dialogue,\\" which, truth be told, suffers in edited form. <br /> <br />The CD features some photos and decent liner notes.  As is the case with all Rhino Chicago reissues, there isn't much difference in the sound from the original production thanks to the innovation of James William Guercio.  Still, the remaster is welcome and the price is right.
B0000214F0|5.0|\\"I have existed since the beginning of the world, and shall exist until the last star falls out of the heavens. Although I have taken the form of Caius Caligula, I Am all men, as I Am no man. I Am a God.\\" - Caligula Caesar.<br /><br />Those words could just have easily been spoken by Lucifer, the ultimate prideful rebel. And in effect, by proxy, they were. as the Satanic spirit is repleat throughout this figure. They were spoken by the namesake of this magnificent historical erotic docu-drama. The original intent of this production was to present the most accurate and realistic portrayal of the events under the Caligulan reign.<br /><br />There is plenty of fair warning in the beginning, that the subject mater may offend and disturb, so no-one need complain about subjecting themselves to the utterly opulent decadence herein. Truly, Rome in all of its glory. Much controversy has followed this film ever since its pre-production, filmed on location in Rome, Italy. Rumors, of orgies, incest, bestiality, extreme cruelty, blood and gore, followed this film since the start - all of which is most assuredly does contain.<br /><br />The DVD includes a revealing \\"making of\\" documentary, which proves to be of great interest with the forboding narrator, with interview inclusions of Bob Guccione {Penthouse publisher and iconoclast, whose scrumptuous 'pets' adorn the film throughout}. Sir John Gielgood {a classic actor of the first callibre}, Peter O'Toole {elite actor who plays Caesar Tiberius}, among others. Here and there, one notices some excised scenes previously unavailable in the widely released form, as it may have proved too extreme for American censors of the time, although I Am sure the European release included them in full.<br /><br />The cinematography remains some of the best this writer has seen, before its time in the forthcoming Daemonocracy, as The Age of Fire enters the next phase, films rated \\"X\\" would be presented in the same theatres as those with an \\"R\\" or \\"PG\\" rating, with proper documentation submitted by individuals for their viewing. The sets are marvellous, displaying veritable temples of the flesh for the indulgent rewards of those who enter its chambers.<br /><br />Kettle drums slowly pound monotonously within the echoing halls of pleasure and ecstasy, joined with a chorus of blissful moans and beautifully undulating bodies, amidst the sweet scents of exotic incenses , all under the lustful gaze of Neptune, Venus, and others gods and goddesses of the Roman pantheon. Deja-Vu, to be sure.<br /><br />Caesar Tiberius must choose a successor. He invites young and naive Caligula to the palace, where he is introduced to some of the elements of betrayal and deceit, and witnesses a justified evisceration as the result of one guard's improper enebriation.<br /><br />The Palace is filled with beauty in both the occupants and their surroundings. Adorned in horned helmets, satyres thrust into eager nymphs who hungrily take the phallii deep into themselves, filled with pleasure. They swing around upon ornate, vine-decorated wreath-like swings, happily straddling phallic attachments in lascivious rapport.<br /><br />Caligula strikes a deal with his right-hand man at the time, named Magnus, a Roman soldier, to kill Tiberius and take the throne. Tiberius is subsequently strangled, and Caligula comes into possession of The Emperor's Ring, which he wields with pride and power. Caligula rises to rulership, together with his sister and lover, becoming increasingly more imbalanced, self-destructively, excessively selfish, and indiscriminate in his proclamations. One telling moment was when he spied a virginal couple attending one of his arena events - this one, a remarkable spectacle which employs an elaborate wall-like beheading apparatus, which swings its propeller-like blades along the ground, where prisoners have been buried up to their necks, then razed in decapitation. Caligula wonders if the girl is really a virgin. He commands them to come to him in his secret chambres, where he taunts the man, a soldier, by the way, and devirginizes his fianc&eacute;' before his traumatized eyes. In a surprising twist, he commands the man to bend over, wherein he thrusts his fist, ring and all - into his rectum. - he no longer is a \\"virgin\\" either. He is later slowly stabbed to death and urinated upon in an effort to divulge the sensation of dying, as Caligula attempted to find out, with Sir John Gielgood's character earlier on, whom he drowned when he determined he was lying.<br /><br />In another scene, youths masturbate into golden bowls providing a facial for a noblewoman. A veritable protein-filled youth lotion which is the progeneration of life.<br /><br />One night, Caligula decides to sleep with a horse. It is rather humorous, as the next scene shows them in bed together, sans a cigarette!<br /><br />In still another scene, Caligula dons the ceremonial vestments of the Priestesses of Isis, and mingles in with them in the chamber of a sacred pool, where he selects the most promiscuous woman in the kingdom to be his wife {probably as a test to see if she will remain faithful}, who subsequently births his heir, a daughter, whom he insists on calling his son {as such the importance placed on male heirs at the time}. Eventually, Caligula goes insane upon the death of his sister / lover from the fever, which is the turning point to more of his crueller exploits, including hosting an orgy which includes the Senate's {the so-called \\"natural enemy of the Emperor\\"} wives and sons, which I believe is what eventually does him in. Also, in his terrible grief, he temporarily lowers himself to the level of the peasants, roaming incognito amongst them, becoming enraged when when he witnesses a troupe of acrobats mocking he and his wife through effigy, thus disrupting their sacrilegious display, which lands him in a filthy jail, wherein he develops a strange affinity for the common folk therein. Upon his return to The Throne, he has the acrobats arrested and executed.<br /><br />In the end, the tyrannical Caligula is assassinated in Egypt by one of his own Generals, as seems to the typical modus-operandi of the Caesars.<br /><br />Overall, Caligula is a remarkable piece of underground paganography that has to be seen to be believed, and therefore, appreciated.a virgin.

B0007CNXUK|4.0|What made author James M. Barrie such a brilliant fantasist is that he could see the world differently, as a child might and was not tied down by society's stuffy conventions. Finding Neverland (2004) is based loosely on an account of how he wrote his most cherished work, Peter Pan. The film was something of a critical darling and connected with audiences but came up short of many awards that year. Miramax hyped it to the sky (along with The Aviator) but is it really all that good or a classic example of the Emperor with no clothes?<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Marc Forster, producer Richard Gladstein and writer David Magee. Forster talks about technical details and the actors' performances while Magee speaks about the evolution of his screenplay, pointing out changes throughout the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Magic of Finding Neverland\\" is a standard behind-the-scenes featurette. The cast and crew talk about what attracted them to the material and gush about working with Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />\\"Creating Neverland\\" is a brief look at the film's visual effects, showing how they pulled off one of the most ambitious shots in the production.<br /><br />\\"On the Red Carpet\\" is a quick look at the various premieres that the cast attended all over the world with interviews as they make their way past the throngs of adoring fans and rabid media.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary by Forster, Gladstein and Magee. They don't really add too much to the movie and were rightly cut.<br /><br />Finally, there is an \\"Outtakes\\" reel of blown lines and silly takes, including a dinner scene full of rude noises that were created in order to get the kids laughing spontaneously.<br /><br />Finding Neverland is a good movie full of charm and one that gradually works itself through your emotions to a climatic payoff that is heart-wrenching and hopeful at the same time. It's not a great film, hardly the Oscar heavyweight that Miramax hoped it would be. Voters must have realized this as well; it received very few statues on Oscar night. Still, one has to admire a movie that champions imagination in this day and age where everything is spelled out and shown to us in explicit detail. It's about time that we celebrated creative dreamers like Barrie.eavyweight that Miramax hoped it would be. Voters must have realized this as well; it received very few statues on Oscar night.

076790592X|5.0|I had heard of this book for years but resisted reading it because it sounded like too sentimental a piece to have any depth.  I stumbled upon the movie version of it and, lacking anything better to do at the time watched it-and wept.  I am still sounding the depth of this piece.  I bought the novel and read it in a couple of hours.  The story between the covers of this book is one that has the potential to move a reader. <br /> <br />There is sentimentality; it would be a poorer novel without it.  The truth is that in the tale the reader is given not only Morrie's unique perspectives on death and dying, but also the chance to vicariously experience the judgement of a life (the author's and Morrie's).  One could read the piece and get nothing more from it but the sad tale of a dying professor, his final words of wisdom and a student's published eulogy.  However, if the work is viewed as food for thought, it provides a banquet of ideas for the reader to sample, taste and either digest or reject. <br /> <br />It is relatively unique in that respect-there is much more to the book than what lies within its cover.
0887307280|5.0|Gerber addresses how to make your business work for you instead of you working for your business. I desperately needed this change from thinking I have to do it all to learning to set up my business so it can run without me.  I believe I am like most small business owners-I know my market and my product but hate the bookkeeping aspects. I have my own business--I get to choose which 20 hours a day I want to work. Gerber explain the typical mentality of a small business owner and how to change your thinking and avoid the common pitfalls. I found it eye-opening.  <br /> <br />The previous review that wrote he only read the first part (then tore it apart on a partial reading) should have read the whole book. The first part presents the problems and the second the solutions. <br />
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I own all of the National's albums, but so far Alligator is my favorite. Like their other albums, there is a real range of songs --- from raging Pixies-esque rock songs to slow ballads that seem to channel Nick Cave or Leonard Cohen. I also get a Cat Stevens or Nick Drake vibe at times-- especially on Daughters of the Soho Riots.  The arrangements are intricate but not overdone. In general the tempos are quicker than their previous albums and there is more snycopation in the drumming. The songwriting both lyrically and musically is great. Well done!
B000002I99|5.0|This album is great. I first found Alice Cooper on that 70's show on fox. The thing that got me interested was his image, so I decided to check out some of his music. I was not disapointed. The first album that I bought was Love it To Death. This one features the hit single I'm Eighteen, and his extremly wierd mental aslylum didy The Ballad Of Dwight Fry. After this I had to get more so I bought Welcome to My Nightmare. WOW. THis is one of the few albums that I have listened to that I liked from the first time I heard it. It is extremly unique and fun. <br /> <br />The highlight of the album was the Steven trilogy. Those songs are really wierd and mildly insane. PERFECT. Those kind've songs are the reason why Alice Cooper is one of my favorite stars in music. He comes up with these great songs and characters and they are almost like theatre performances done to song. If there were a musical staring a figure in a Mental Asylum I would reccomend Alice Cooper. <br /> <br />Some other good songs are Welcome to My Nightmare and Only Women Bleed. Both of these songs are great fun, and Only Women Bleed has some great sad lyrics, and even though it is a little slow, it just hooks you. And for great fun on the second track you get to hear the insane ravings of Vincent Price.  <br /> <br />This is the best Alice Cooper album that I have heard so far, you will love this. Buy it. BUY IT NOW!!! <br /> <br />THE GREAT ETNEBOB HAS SPOKEN
6304696515|5.0|I am going to be real with you all. I actually just saw Dangerous Liaisons for the first time last night, and to tell you the truth I loved it. I of course saw Cruel Intentions when it had first came out, and thought it was just the greatest thing due to my infatuation with Ryan Phillippe lol. However, after seeing Dangerous Liaisons, I've realized that Cruel Intentions shouldn't have ever been made. I mean honestly why would this guy even think that making a remake as... watered down as Cruel Intentions would even come as close to being as good as the original? Don't get me wrong, Ryan is still hot, but hell no this version is better. I recommend anyone who is like me, and hasn't seen it yet to get this dvd. If you even thought of liking Cruel Intentions, you'll love this.    Just.. one little issue on the other hand. John Malkovich is not the least bit sexy, and therefore I was not completely convinced that he was such the ladies man as he was portrayed to be. I understand \\"it's just a movie\\" and all, but honetly. I don't know maybe it wasn't his appearance that made him so wanted. Maybe what he lacked for in looks, he made up for in... other areas :wink: haha All right I'm just going to stop right here.

B0007GAERG|5.0|THERE IS NO DENYING THAT SHE IS THE BOMB DIGGITY.   SO TIRED OF MEDIOCRE SINGERS THAT HAVE HIT RECORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD IMAGE OR AN AGENT THAT PROMOTES THEM TO DEATH.  MIMI IS TOO MANY THINGS BUT ANYONE WHO EVER HEARD HER SING KNOWS THAT.  IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE HER LIVE, DO IT.  SHE BRINGS IT EVERY TIME. SHE ROCKS HARD.  PEACE.
B00063MBU8|2.0|it is not the best cd to buy. it might be catchy but its boring. too alternative!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I am a big fan of chick flicks; they aren't necessarily films that I buy and watch on my own time, but if one's on TV I'll watch certain parts of it or the whole thing.  I think that they're just nice, feel-good movies to watch.  I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, though I thought it was very flawed.  Then, not too long after I got home, these flaws kept digging into me and finally I realized exactly how crappy of a movie it really was. <br /> <br />I'm going to echo what other people are saying about the September 11 thing.  Umm, here's the thing... this movie isn't American, it's English.  You can't claim this tragedy for yourselves.  No matter how much empathy you feel for the USA, it's just not the same.  If the film had been set in America, showing how love went on in America after 9-11, that would have been a lot more appropriate.   <br /> <br />I'm going to echo what everyone else said and say that most of the storylines absolutely sucked; they were vapid and had very little character/relationship development.  The only storylines that I cared about, like Emma Thompson's and Laura Linney's, were very inconclusive.  The storylines that did have happy conclusions were ones that I really didn't care about at all. <br /> <br />I have a MAJOR problem with the blatant America-bashing in this movie as well.  Did no one else seem to care that the Prime Minister of England broke his alliance with the USA because the American President was macking on a SINGLE woman, who just happened to coincidentally be the PM's love interest?  WTF?  And the English people are HAPPY about it!  So in celebration of his selfish and rash decision to which for some reason no one seems to object, Hugh Grant dances. Great.  Also, he was the most unbelievable PM I've ever seen. <br /> <br />Oh, and this is the one that really made me mad... the English guy who goes to America to meet hot American chicks and shacks up with some hot co-eds.  Where does he go?  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Ifyou cannot tell from my location info, I am from WI.  If you walk into a bar here, even in Milwaukee, you are not likely to find sexy southern chicks who invite you to room with them.  You ARE likely to find drunk middle-aged men watching a Packers game.  I saw this movie with my friend, and we all thought that the kid was dreaming it up.  Imagine our surprise when we found out that we were actually supposed to believe that could happen.  Um, yeah, right. <br /> <br />The other stories were just dumb.  How many dashing to different countries/airport scenes can one movie take?  Just one is unbelievable enough.  Frankly, I don't care about any of the stories, aside from those two.  And those two were unresolved.  Absolutely wonderful.  They should take those two stories and make movies about them... cut out the rest of this tripe.  Even those storylines had major problems.  Like Alan Rickman's secretary.  She's presented as a slut that you're just supposed to hate.  Great character development right there! <br /> <br />I've been to England and whatever country I saw in that movie did not seem like it.  The only thing they had going was the lingo (which, IMO they seemed to lay on thick just for us, the American audience who is like \\"Hehehe, they said \\"blimey\\"!  I love English people!) and the accents.  It's a shame, because I really like London and would really have liked to love this movie.  I tried, I really did. <br /> <br />Really, they would have been better off focusing on two or three stories.  Sixteen is entirely too much.  Each story felt detached; I can't even remember the characters' names.  Also, I did not appreciate the cheat shots at America.  From what I've seen of reviews at this site, even non-Americans were offended.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi is definitely Mariah's best album since Butterfly.  TEOM is an album you can listen to over and over again.  Every song on the album is a hit!  My most favorite songs on the album: We Belong Together, One & Only, Fly Like A Bird.  Everyone should go out and buy this cd, because it is worth it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is masterpiece. Brutal, heavy and fast. I love it.  Slayer is one of my favourite bands and this is their best.  This is first Slayer album I got and when I listened it first time I became a fan. My favourite songs are Angel of death and Raining blood. True metal classics. I love also Necrophobic, because its so fast and Criminally insane.    This is a must buy for all who like metal.
B00003CXAA|4.0|I've waited so much time to buy those DVDs, I wanted the whole package, the whole story. I really enjoyed those movies, I couldn't stop, I watched them in one day only! Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in !! The music is great, you just can't forget the mandoline theme when it's starting. All the characters, all the locations, Italy, New York, the intrigues, the romance, everything is perfect !
B0007Y4USW|4.0|Once again a superb effort by Ms. Carey. Her voice continues to grow better and stronger with each album. This album is a must have for all of \\"Mimi's\\" fans. Cd boasts some great ballads such as \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Mine Again\\" \\"Circles\\"(my favorite song on cd)and \\"Joy Ride\\".  Don't call it a comeback, She's been here for years.
B0007GAERG|5.0|As the September Grammy deadline slowly approaches, you must admit that this album will be a frontrunner. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is the first serious contender released in 2005. This is a Mariah-Carey Masterpiece. This doesn't blend in with her others. It stands alone and it stands out. It just doesn't get much better. She has set the bar pretty high with this album. Her vocals are fantastic and her songwriting is stellar. This is definitely a return to form. If she had been nominated for Best New Artist for this CD, she would have won again. After listening to this record, it's clear as to why she's sold over 100M albums worldwide. This is Mariah's defining moment and she passes with flying colors. A lot of people had written her off, but I always had faith because she has the talent that legends are made of. She actually does some of her best work on this recording. Her ability hasn't diminished with age. She's actually gotten better. On the lead song \\"It's Like That\\" she says, \\"It's a special occasion/ Mimi's Emancipation/ A cause for a celebration.\\" Indeed, we should be celebrating this great return. She ends the album with \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" saying, \\"I need you now Lord / Carry me high.\\" Not only is the Lord carrying Mariah higher, we're all being lifted up with her great songs. This will be one of the most memorable CD of 2005. Mariah Carey has done it again. She has left the doubters dumbfounded. Here's to hoping that Mariah keeps taking us higher and higher.
B0007GAERG|4.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" finds me, once again, in the unusual position of defending Mariah Carey, a singer I strongly resisted during much of her chart supremacy in the 1990s.  It wasn't until she dropped the sterile ballads and got a little soul in her groove with the help of hip hop producers did I begin to warm up to her.  And I'll also risk ridicule by testifying that I did actually like \\"Charmbracelet\\" and the soundtrack to \\"Glitter,\\" whose movie dealt a near fatal blow to Mariah's career.  Say what you will about her fashion taste and her career moves, but one thing is certain: this lady can sing, and as \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" proves, the voice is far from shot.  On her third album since leaving Sony, Mariah delivers a mix of hip hop dance cuts and retro-themed ballads, all set to highlight Mariah's still-there vocal range.  The strongest cuts, no doubt, are the ballads, whether they're slick r&b numbers (\\"We Belong Together\\") or old school throwbacks (\\"Mine Again\\").  But the best of the bunch is \\"Circles,\\" in which Mariah's voice takes off with full force without the dramatic oversinging that she was known for in the 1990s.  Compared to her other albums, \\"Mimi\\" could very well be her most soulful effort to date.  She spread her wings like a butterfly; she saw the rainbow; made it through the rain, and she's now emancipated.
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is the most intimate introduction to India that you could ever get on paper. Second to (and some cases even suprassing)the real experience, this book brings India to life before your very eyes. The writting is brilliant, concise and yet philosophical at the same time. India and its many different people come to life, as does the energy and excitement of crime and being a fugitive that the hero is. But more than this, this books does a respectable job of trying to answer (or atleast ponder) life's toughest questions. The most powerful part of this book is showing the amount of despair the human soul can survive. It gives you hope and sadness at the same time, it opens your eyes and lets you indulge all your physical and emotional senses in a life full of meaning, pain and most of all survival. <br />
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This show is so clever and witty!  I love the fast-paced/ quippy dialogue and you really get in to the characters!  Every week, I'm counting down the days until the next episode!  I heard they've recently said there will be a second season- but I'm hoping they will put out the 1st season on DVD as well!  This is the best show I've come across in a long time- It's only a matter of time before it catches on!!!
0743454537|2.0|Back in England this was the last of the Richard and Judy books I needed to read to complete the 10 up for this year's Best Read award and to be honest I was dreading it. One look at the blurb was enough to make me want to never, ever pick it up. Well the good news is that I found it a more anjoyable book than either the woeful \\"Time Traveler's Wife\\" or the tedious \\"Feel.\\" Picoult demonstrates an easy,fluent style that enables you to bomb through the book. The multiple narrative form is straightforward and simple to follow and these factors make this a \\"page turner.\\" <br />I have however a number of problems with the book. The first of these is the fact that this book is praised because it addresses medical,ethical and moral problems.I must have missed something but I wasn't aware of the fact that great literature has to address problems.It's like praising \\"The Odyssey\\" because Homer was pointing out the difficulties that might occur if you're lost and can't find your way home. A modern version would have the GPS malfunctioning ! To my mind the book is like an adult version of Judy Blume. It seems to me that in a novel of this kind the problem comes first and then the story is draped around it. <br />The multiple narrative works fine, but I was particularly concerned with Anna's offerings. I had to keep reminding myself that this was supposed to be a 13 year old girl. To my mind her many sections in the book just do not read like a young teenager.She has too many snappy,adult-like one-liners and the manner in which her voice is heard does not strike me as childlike.  <br />The sub plot concerning Campbell and Julia I found deeply unconvincing. The co-incidence of their meeting up a second time stretched credulity a bit far and then for Campbell to have his own \\"problem\\" struck me as totally unecessary. <br />I also found the inevitable mawkishness at the conclusion disappointing as well as the bizarre rounding up of Jesse's life.It was all just too neat, when in reality, I would suggest, life is rarely, if ever, so easily arranged. <br />So if you like an easy page turner then the book is fine. If you're interested in the Richard and Judy books I can only say it's not in the same league as \\"The Promise of Happiness\\" , \\"Cloud Atlas\\", \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and \\"The American Boy\\" which are 4 books I'd happily recommend to one and all. <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />                    OR                                        <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001CNRBG|4.0|When you first see George and Doris, they're decked out in 1950s clothes.  In fact Doris is wearing some \\"New Look\\" outfits that show it must be during the 1950s.  Some years later we see the faces of Ike and Adlai Stevenson, showing the 1950s and the rise of Elvis Presley, and Doris picks a quarrel with George.  (At least that is my interpretation.)  How did they get the two stars to look so young?  If you ask me, the makeup people should have won the Oscar, not the stars!  Just kidding because actually, the stars are excellent and Ellen Burstyn easily out does her part in ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANY MORE.  Watching the movie on DVD you can appreciate her more, in fact living through the movie is rather like leafing through one of those books about THE FILMS OF ELLEN BURSTYN, for many of her \\"looks\\" from her previous movies are referenced-from time to time you will see the young, innocent Burstyn of her TV days when she was still billed as \\"Ellen McRae,\\" and then you will experience the sensual, assured Ellen Burstyn of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Fast forward a bit to Burstyn as Chris in \\"The Exorcist,\\" and then to her wonderful part in the Jules Dassin film with Melina Mercouri, \\"A Dream of Passion.\\"  In the very last part of the film, set in 1977, Burstyn is skillfully aged so that she seems almost to be an old woman, forecasting the way she would come to look in, say, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.<br /><br />Next to her you realize that Alan Alda's appearance doesn't change that much (though he has many comic moments in the hippie era) but he's providing admirable support to Burstyn and he never lets her down.  Wonder why neither of them truly made it as superstars.  What they lack in looks (and both are very good looking, just not \\"perfect\\" in the way of Hollywood) they both have in talent.  The script of STNY is serviceable, and the California locations in Mendocino are superb.  When I first saw the movie, I decided that if you have to cheat, Heritage House is the place to do it in.  Many years later, I regretted both my decisions.to do it in.  Many years later, I regretted both my decisions.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Everyone MARIAH (the voice) is BACK!!!  This is without a doubt her best CD to date.  Mine Again and We Belong Together are the types of ballads that only MIMI could pull off effortlessy.  This is a CD that you can put in and cool out to without skipping a track.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|These boys are on the drugs and creating great music. Period.  <br /> <br />There music has too many influances to name them all. Rock to latin to pschyodelic.  <br /> <br />Outstanding music by out standing musicians.  Creative, longwinded and emotional music.   <br /> <br />If your looking for rock that doesn't suck, this is the album for you.
B000002KKC|5.0|This maybe the album you missed !     Tusk is a classic but it followed so closely behind 'Rumours' that it was never respectfully appreciated. Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours'(1977)was the number one selling album of all time at the time it was released. It outsold Saturday Night Fever to reach that position and was not beaten until 5 years later by Michael Jackson's `Thriller'.    'Rumours' made any later successes that this Supergroup had seem insignificant. I saw this band live in 1980 and the tour itself was overshadowed by the band's excessive demands  as part of the tour contract and the widely publicised interpersonal problems that both McVie-McVie and Buckingham-Nicks were having prior to their eminant breakups.    When a band is this consistent in it's material that it can fill a double album with 19 extremely high quality and varied tracks after such a prior record breaking effort, then it does so the depth of talent and creativity that this band had at this time.    If you haven't heard this one before, it is a timeless masterpiece and must be heard to fully encapsulate the Mac.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but I loved it.  Ashton Kutcher is, and always will be, a pinhead in my mind - Dude, where's my car?  Note that I loved that movie.  It is SO hard to take him seriously.  But I couldn't help it - this movie is excellent.  The script is GREAT, and the movie had me jumping out of my skin.  I won't reveal anything of the plot to you.  I guarantee you that once you see this movie, you will have to watch it once more, to catch what you missed the first time.<br /><br />The special effects were excellent, not over the top.  The continuity of the film is excellent.  And the DVD setup allows you to watch the movie with the deleted scenes worked in, as a director's cut.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, original horror/thriller with far more emphasis on plot than on gore.  You will not be disappointed.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Look, I just want to say to all those people who are complaning about wanting 90's Mariah back. I just want ya'll to know THIS IS 2005!!!! None of you could be REAL Mariah fan's...unless ya'll want her to fail.  Why would you want her to sing 90's ballads?? I dont get it!  She would not sell!  I want to know what kind of music do you people listen to who are writing the negative reviews?  Barbara Streisand or something?  To be a musical artist YOU HAVE TO ADAPT OR DIE.  If Mariah sang 90's ballads, then people who have something else to complain about, like \\"Oh she's stuck in the 90's\\".  Poor Mimi...YOU CANT WIN.  BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!  EMANCIPATION IS HOT!!  CIRCLES IS DAT JOINT!  and so is SAY SOMETHING, AND SHAKE IT OFF.  4/5 stars...cause nobody is perfect...there's always roomfor improvement, otherwise I'd give u a 5. And I give a finger to all those HATERS.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|Selling out. Selling out is not a term I like to use, but for me it describes what slipknot did with Vol. 3 to a T. now before you skip my review because you don't agree with it just look at the facts: slipknot goes much more melodic with their third CD, then releases their lightest single to that date. Duality. Slipknot merch. appears like locusts all over hot topic. More middle school kids are wearing their shirts than usual, even the punk kids. Then they release the song Vermillion pt. I can't remember. And do you know what the members of slipknot are doing all this time? filling their swimming pools with money and swimming with Benjamin Franklin. Now I would call that selling out.   <br /> <br />But other than the whole selling out thing, it is a decent CD. But really you should buy the black dahlia murder, alive or just breathing, or the impossibility of reason first.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|A friend recomended this DVD to me, so I bought the DVD.  Don't be fooled - this movie sucks.  I admit that I liked the title song (Behind Blue Eyes), originally done by the Who, as well as the video of the song.  But the movie itself was a poor imitation of The Sixth Sense and, especially, Stir of Echoes.  The plot is somewhat preposterous, even for a horror film.<br /><br />Halle Berry looks good in the film, and she didn't do a bad job acting.  In fact, all the actors and actresses Gothika tried their best to do a good job and are fairly credible.  But the script is lame and the premise is foolish.  Overall, the movie is pretty tired.  This movie adds nothing to the genre.

0312995423|4.0|Dan Brown has made his mark in the world of fiction by combining complex mental puzzles with action-filled adventure and romance.  His thriller, \\"Digital Fortress\\" has all of these elements, and it is an exhilarating novel that raises timely and thought-provoking questions.<br /><br />A covert agency, known as NSA (jokingly, \\"No Such Agency\\"), has a multi-billion dollar secret device known as TRANSLTR that can decrypt any code.  It is used to eavesdrop on encrypted email communications worldwide; the data that it gathers prevents terrorists from carrying out planned attacks.  However, if civilians were to find out that Uncle Sam is eavesdropping on them, they might not be too pleased.  Ensei Tankado, a cryptographer who was dismissed by the NSA, hates everything that TRANSTR stands for.  He believes that the government has gone too far in invading people's privacy.<br /><br />Tankado claims to have created an unbreakable algorithm, known as \\"digital fortress,\\" that even TRANSLTR cannot decipher.  He threatens to release his algorithm unless the NSA publicly admits that it illegally gathers private information.  If the general public were to learn Tankado's code, the government would lose its ability to read encrypted emails. Tankado's scheme goes awry, and what might have been merely a nuisance threatens to turn into a disaster.<br /><br />Brown makes the most of his subject.  His descriptions of how cryptographers work and think are terrific, and I was fascinated by the mind-bending ciphers at the end of the novel. The protagonists, Susan Fletcher and David Becker, are nicely drawn, although a tad too superhuman.  Susan is a brilliant cryptographer who works for the NSA, and David is an expert in linguistics.  They both play a major role in trying to save the United States from an intelligence meltdown.<br /><br />\\"Digital Fortress\\" does have some weak points, including Brown's inability to write realistic romantic dialogue.  However, when Brown sticks to sadistic assassins, wild chase scenes, and unlikely heroics, the story moves along at a breakneck pace.  In addition, the author has some significant things to say about the conflict between an individual's right to privacy and the government's mission to do whatever it takes to safeguard its citizenry.and unlikely heroics, the story moves along at a breakneck pace.

B00000I07P|1.0|Right off the bat, I'm gonna say it. I hate Bon Jovi with a vengeance and this album is the reason. Oh, I had plenty of reasons to hate them before this and I always thought they were a lame excuse for a rock band but this album took the cake. When the album preceeding this one, 7800 Fairenheit came out, these guys had already caused me grief twice. The first time, I was sitting at a girl's house and took a magic marker and renamed the band \\"Bad Joke\\" on the 7800 Fairenheit cover, it wasn't hard, just manipulate the letters a bit, but it fit and I was proud of my work. The girl, however, was not and started spouting off about my damaging her property and asked me to leave. Well, in retrospect, maybe I should thank Bon Jovi, cause she was a bit nutty, going off about a little thing like that. The second time was unforgivable, Bad Joke were riding on the coattails of Black Sabbath on a tour (the version of Sabbath with no less than Ian Gillan as vocalist) and my best friend and I had tickets. These two girls we knew wanted us to take them, so we did, and we sat through Blow Jobi's horrid set and Richie Sambora's sophomoric one note guitar solo and were readying ourselves for Sabbath. Well 3 songs into Sabbath these girls start whinning and complaining that they wanted to leave so much, we finally took them home and missed a milestone never to be repeated with Sabbath.  That was enough to make me hate Bon Jovi for life, but then this tepid little piece of trash called Slippery When Wet comes out. A cliche ridden (what do you expect when Desmond Child is a writer?!?!), hardly rocking, pile of excrement that wasn't fit for a boy band. Yeah, I was biased already, but this sludge was unforgivable. I had an analogy I used to give people (mainly girls, no guys I knew ever defended this poop)when they would defend this crap, and it was, how well would you like this crap if Jon Bon Jovi looked like Tiny Tim, and the answer I usually got (grudginly) was not much. So this musicis basically good to lie a bed, and think of that dreamy Jon Bon singing it, nothing more, nothing less. So for a non-gay male such as myself, this band had nothing to offer. No wonder you don't see too many guys in Bon Blowme's videos fist pumping to their rockin' tunes, unless they dug something other than the music (wink wink). This clcihe riden dung has no redeeming value whatsoever. Now to the songs---Let It Rock (girly metal), You Give Love A Bad Name (yeah? and you give hair metal a bad name, Jon). This song was played so often, I could name the tune in 1 note and fly from wherever I was standing to make sure I didn't hear the second note. Livin' On A Prayer--a song of love's survival beating the odds supposedly, but then Bon Bon sings,\\" it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not\\", which rendered the whole song pointless. Social Disease is what you get when you listen to this Bon Jon Jon character to much. Wanted Dead Or Alive-- \\"I'm a cowboy\\" (right Bonehead and I'm a rocket scientist, puh-leeze!!!). Sad attempt at a soundtrack song for Young Guns, another 80's artifact that should be shot and put out of it's misery. Hop on your steel horse and pedal your happy ass home, Boo Joobi!!!!! Raise Your Hands--The title is a cliche and so is every line of the song. Basically an excuse to (what else?)raise your hands at a Bon Ami show!!! What fun! Without Love, I'd Die For You and Wild In the Streets and any others I didn't mention are even worse than the one's I already wasted time on. This album has won worst of awards in every magazine I can think of, and is on many critics worst of lists also. Why would anyone want this? It's absolutely horrible!
B000093BDX|5.0|For the young generation: despite my grey bearded, old, pretty old-fashioned father is the owner of a Beach Boys LP, I still love this music. What do I say? A feeling of delight suddenly comes back when I, wherever I may be, hear the timeless sounds of Barbara Ann, Surfin' U.S.A. and Good Vibrations. This album is a treasure, left off by a band with a very particular own style.     True, the lyrics of many songs on this compilation may have not too much depth. If you're in favour of a poetic masterpiece, I'd recommend you 'Pet Sounds', the brilliant work of Brian Wilson and Tony Asher. But for a light-hearted trip to a delightful spot, this album is worth a place in your CD tower.
B000059H99|5.0|This is the story...a story which everyone loves, a story about heart, willpower and never giving up. I first watched this movie when I was 10. At that time, I thought this was a great movie, but so was Neverending Story and Popeye. But the difference is, I watch this movie today...more than a decade later and I still think it's a great movie, in fact I appreciate it on so many more levels than I did before. Which brings me to my point, this is a timeless classic.  <br /> <br />When you think about it, the story is quite typical...nothing extraordinary. Rocky Balboa grew up in what seems to be the slums of Philly. He is a club fighter and he collects debt for his boss, Tony Gazzo by whatever means necessary, which of course includes things like breaking bones. Mick, a hardened trainer knows that if Rocky puts his mind to it, he can achieve so much more and is unhappy with what Rocky does for a living. And one day, Rocky gets a chance of lifetime to fight the current Heavyweight Champ, Apollo Creed due to some injury forcing Apollo's initial advessary out of the fight. Apollo views this as a promotional gimmick for him and sees this increasing his popularity. Meanwhile, Rocky falls for Adrienne, a very shy girl who works in the pet store. Their relationship ends up becoming one of the emotional foundations of this movie. What happens next? Watch it to find out, you'll be surprised and might even find yourself wiping a few tears along the way. <br /> <br />First of all, few movies touch the heart as this one did. All the actors in the movie are superb and they definitely look and act the part. The difference between this movie and many others is you actually find yourself caring for the characters. You feel what they feel and you are rooting for them. The fact that Sylvester Stallone's life at that time reflects Rocky's makes the movie even more compelling. You can practically see his passion in the film. It's just that instead of boxing, he was trying to make it bigin acting, which after this movie...he accomplished. A drive to be better and to be successful is something everyone can relate to, especially if that success comes after much pain and hardwork. <br /> <br />Something that other reviewers fail to mention was the music in this movie by Bill Conti. It is one of the most amazing scores ever produced. It fitted perfectly with the movie at all stages. The music is part of what made this movie so memorable. <br /> <br />I have enjoyed this movie thoroughly throughout the years and I still do. They did squeeze Rocky for as much money as they can make, and thus resulting in 4 unnecessary sequels. And other than a few occasional good flicks, Stallone's movies seem to be all brawn and no brain, or heart for that matter. Anyway, this original Rocky definitely earned a place in my book of classic movies and it did win a very deserving Oscar. If you don't own this movie or worse still, haven't watched it...what are you waiting for, get this DVD....it is well worth it.
B000003S0I|5.0|\\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" is one of King Crimson's mostly highly acclaimed albums, and it's also one of their best.  While not as accessible as, say, \\"Red\\", it explores numerous musical avenues that album does not.  There are so many dizzying moods and textures here.  It's almost overwhelming on the first listen (maybe the first several listens for some), but it is an exciting musical journey.<br /><br />The album is bookended by two mammoth instrumentals \\"Lark's Toungues in Aspic\\" parts 1 and 2.  Part 1 begins with odd tribal percussion, building into a menacing heavy riff, and from there moving into odd passages of ambience.  It is, I think one of the band's best and most exciting instrumentals.  Part 2 is more rock-oriented, with crushing rhythms and insane time signatures.  It makes for a really great ending to the album.<br /><br />In the middle, we have three songs with lyrics, and one other instrumental.  \\"Book of Saturday\\" is a short ballad, with great guitar and vocal melodies.  \\"Exiles\\" is epic beauty, with acoustic guitars and strings, to create mesmerizing atmospheres.  \\"Easy Money\\" is very catchy and slightly funky, with a hypnotic grooving intrumental section in the middle.  \\"The Talking Drum\\" is a fun instrumental, with killer percussion, wicked basslines, and some nice melodic guitar soloing.<br /><br />With an album that is half instrumental (actually, more than half), you might think there'd be a sense of imbalance to it all, and with many bands, that might have been the case, but KC are masters of composition, and the way they bring everything together is simply magical.  This is not from the Dream Theater camp of throwing in a bunch of fast noodling just for the sake of it.  The music here is very rhythmically dense, with multiple layers and textures, and the interplay between the musicians is brilliantly organic.  Bill Bruford's subtle jazzy drumming, Jamie Muir's alien percussion, Robert Fripp's understated but complex guitar work, and John Wetton's nimble basslines all fit together into a magnificent musical beast.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this album is the production.  Some of the louder parts sound fuzzy and restrained, and the quieter parts are at times nearly inaudible.  But that's not really a big deal.  After all, it was the 70's, and production quality generally wasn't as good back then as it is today.<br /><br />Ok, I'm done yammering now.  This is classic prog, and there's nothing else like it.  Recommended to all fans of exciting and unusual music.John Wetton's nimble basslines all fit together into a magnificent musical beast. <br /> <br />The only bad thing about this album is the production.

B0007OCG56|2.0|This movie would get 1 and half stars if that were possible. The downfall being the ending. There are so many unanswered questions and dangling plot lines it made me wonder if this was part one, but considering it's 2 hour plus lenght, I guess that's the movie. In a nutshell, this is the story of a chef who has a nutcase wife who cannot take care of things, so they hire a maid to do it. Sandler's character falls for her, but he is a bit timid and doesn't let his emotions show until late in the movie when it may be too late. Without giving away the ending (or lack of an ending)I will leave it at the fact you will be scratching your head as the credits roll. Why some of the silly overlong conversations between Sandler and Leoni weren't edited a bit more and more time devoted to closure is a mystery that may never be solved.     On the plus side, Sandler shows more depth than he's ever given to a role, and his \\"angry young man\\" schtick surfaced only mildly a couple times. But he acts like he's a little slow in parts and it really isn't a trait that a 4 star chef would realistically display. But he tries, and he is slowly becoming a decent all around actor. Paz Vega is a welcome newcomer who displays a great presence (and looks a bit like Selma Hayek which doesn't hurt her or the eyes a bit!!). And the surprise of the movie is Cloris Leechman, who provides about 80% of the much needed comic relief in this sometimes heavy handed movie.     Tea Leona on the other hand, is a bi-polar mess. Would a family well off enough to be able to afford a maid really let a person in that shape languish as long as she does? It's kind of unbelievable. She is so out of it at points you'll find yourself wondering why Sandler doesn't run screaming to his car and drive away. FAST!! But that would be too easy I suppose.    So what we have here is a lot of failure to communicate. Sandler's character can't communicate with his wife, his wife can't communicate with him, neither one can communicate with the maid (until over halfway through she speaks very little English) and Cloris only communicates near the end of the movie with her daughter (and then gives some advice that is shakey given Leoni's out of touch character!!). Don't misunderstand, there is plenty of talking going on, it's just most of the time nothing gets said or resolved and the fact that with all this communication breakdown, this movie clocks 131 minutes!!!! The movie isn't a total loss, but it needed just a tad more tweaking which could have changed it from a passable piece of entertainment to a very good one.
B00008BXJF|5.0|King Crimson have been one of the most enduring forces in progressive rock since the genre began.  Since day one, they've always stood out from the pack.  While bands like Yes, Genesis, and ELP were making more garish, cheesy symphonic prog (no offense to them), King Crimson were making a darker, heavier, more eclectic, and just generally different style of prog.  In my mind, they were always far better than those bands, and better yet, they've managed to outlast them as well.  Genesis and ELP slowly deteriorated and are now defunct, and Yes are still together, although their best days are long behind them.<br /><br />But not King Crimson.  They have managed to modernize and reinvent their sound over the years, and stay consistently brilliant, and fresh.  Their newest album, \\"The Power to Believe\\", is no exception.  While not a huge difference from its predecessors, \\"Thrak\\" and \\"The Construktion of Light\\", this album nonetheless is proof that the band are far from being stuck in the 70's.  In fact, if you listened to this with no prior knowledge of the band, you'd never know that the band was that old.  It's very difficult to believe that Robert Fripp was approaching 60 when he made this.<br /><br />So, what does this album sound like?  Well, in many ways, it is like a \\"Lark's Tongues\\" for the new generation.  It is largely instrumental, with a multi-part title track that explores many musical avenues.  The familiar dark ominous grooves are there, but the band also incorporates more modern musical styles, like modern metal and electronic music.  Drummer Pat Mastelloto incorporates some triggered sampling effects with his mathematical onslaughts, and Trey Gunn provides a wide array of odd sounds with his Warr guitar.<br /><br />The title track appears sporadically in multiple parts, bookending the album with short intros and outros.  Part 2 includes some wicked percussion, somewhat reminiscent of \\"Lark's Tongues\\", but with a very different feel.  Part 3 is more soft and laid-back, with some odd effects and beautiful guitar work.  Each part includes a repeated spoken word lyrical bit to tie each part together.  No one seems to understand the meaning of this (myself included), but it's cool in its cryptic weirdness.<br /><br />The album contains three other instrumentals.  \\"Level Five\\" is the most \\"Crimsonian\\", with the wicked time signatures and  heavy growling guitars that the band is known for.  But the song is very modern in feel, sort of like classic Crimson with a 21st century facelift.  \\"Elektrik\\", as you might guess from the name, is very electronic sounding, with powerful machine-like drumming.  \\"Dangerous Curves\\" is centered around a repeating staccato riff, with very gradual and climactic buildup.  I really love the feel of this song in particular.  It makes me want to drive through LA really fast at night.<br /><br />The vocal tracks are excellent as well, and stand out nicely among all the great instrumental stuff.  \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is very soft and atmospheric, with great vocals from Adrian.  \\"Facts of Life\\" is heavy and menacing, with some weird but thought-provoking lyrics.  \\"Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With\\" is also very heavy, but much more light-hearted in tone.  It's sort of a parody of mindless verse-chorus-verse rock, with lyrics that sound like they were just made up as they went along.  That's another great thing about KC, they don't take themselves too seriously.  This song is just really goofy and fun, but still manages to work in some really cool instrumentation.<br /><br />King Crimson are the godfathers of progressive music, and here they prove they can still compete.  Even with the rise of great bands like Tool, Meshuggah, The Mars Volta, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, any many others who are pushing the boundaries of music in interesting ways, Fripp and the rest can still show all these kids who the masters really are.  I feel sorry for those who are stuck in the past, and can't accept this newincarnation of the band.  Luckily the band themselves don't share this mindset.<br /><br />They've got a new album that should be coming out sometime in the near future.  It can't possibly get here fast enough.emselves don't share this mindset.    They've got a new album that should be coming out sometime in the near future.  It can't possibly get here fast enough.
0767836324|3.0|I liked it but it was only okay. The beggining was very boring, and the end was vey boring. The middle was very strange, for example, Peter Pan (Robin Williams) was eating invisable food. Kind of strange if you ask me. Little kids would like it though.

0395645662|5.0|For those who are reading or going to read the Giver here's some advice for future connections in reading group discussions. <br /> In your groups you have discussions and in your discussions you have to make some connections if any. It's nearly impossible to make connections to the Giver. Text to text, text to self, and text to world connections are hard to come by when reading this novel. <br /> How? Well, this is a made up book just like a lot of other books are. But, this book not only takes place in an unreal town or city, it also takes place in an almost unreal planet type world. People do some of the same things on Earth as other Earthlings do. So it is nearly impossible to connect what we do here on Earth to what they do on their own planet. That wipes out the ability to make text to world connections. <br /> Another reason for this near impossibility to connect is accounted for the deepness and detail that Lois Lowery writes in. She writes with such detail that you don't see the main points of the plot. You're lost in detail.  <br /> Some books you can relate The Giver are other sifi, methodical book such as The Lord of the Rings, and the Star Wars series. <br /> I feel that in connecting you must thing outside the box to get information that is identical to both books. I hope I have given you advice to not only assist the process to connect The Giver but other books as well.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I am a metal fan and I feel that it is kinda weird for me to like this band. But I really dig this album. It kinda kicks in at the right time while Punk is boring, Heavy metal is kinda dead-end, and Hip-hop is all about killing and sex. It is like a breath of fresh air. My 4-year old really loves the title track and he can sing along too !!!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as \\"The Blue Album\\") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?<br /><br />The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, \\"Mykel and Carli\\" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"Jamie\\" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as \\"The Kitchen Tapes\\" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (\\"My Name Is Jonas\\" & \\"Surf Wax America\\") and acoustic versions (\\"Jamie\\" and \\"No One Else\\"), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of \\"Say It Ain't So\\" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.<br /><br />Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.coustic versions (\\"Jamie\\" and \\"No One Else\\"), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of \\"Say It Ain't So\\" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album).

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This album is just a little better than the first one. But this is it !!! It has a very retro sound especially the song \\"Under control\\". I like almost every track. I also like the album cover which is very artsy.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance, probably one of the biggest rising stars of the moment, really break out with this, their second full-length release (and first through Reprise Records). \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" is ultimately unlike everything else out there. Sure, they fit into the whole \\"screamo\\" (if you can tolerate that word) movement, but they are far more creative and outstanding than most of the bands they are lumped in with. MCR combine today's style of music with more classic alternative and punk stylings, as opposed to just being another emo band with guitars. This album itself is a step-up from their debut, and listening to it, it's very easy to see why there is so much hype around them right now.<br /><br />\\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" is a concept album (those are sure popular these days...) with song titles that definitely grab your attention (\\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison?\\"). Pretty much all of the songs are catchy, and each one could be a single, which isn't a bad thing. It's a really well made album. \\"Ghost Of You\\" is probably the best song on here, and has the band leaning on their softer side, while \\"To The End\\" and the previously mentioned \\"You Know\\" are fast paced, edgy crowd pleasers. \\"Helena,\\" is the perfect opener and features all of the dynamics that are used for the rest of the album (in short, this song will probably decide whether or not you'll like the rest of the album).<br /><br />Overall, it's a great album, front to back, beginning to end. If you are looking for something a little different, My Chemical Romance will satisfy. If you can get past their Hot-Topic and teenage audience image and just have an open mind, you'll find yourself enjoying this for the brilliant and fully realized piece that it is.
B000063DHL|5.0|As others note here, this album seems like an experiment for IM. There are synth guitars (and synth bass) here and there, and sometimes the guitars get sort of \\"lost\\" in all the sound they're producing--that is, at times the guitars seem quite a bit more \\"distant\\" than they did on previous albums. This album, as I said, marks the \\"beginning of the end\\" of IM because it would lead to what I believe their high-point (Seventh Son) and subsequent dismissal of Adrian Smith (the better of the two guitarists) for Jannick Gers, who I saw live in 1991 and about made me want to puke he was so bad. \\"No Prayer for the Dying,\\" the album after Adrian's departure, was the last draw and I quit liking IM after that point.<br /><br />After about 10 years of smooth jazz, I decided it was time to rediscover my roots, and I went back to the first IM album I ever heard or owned: Somewhere in Time (incidentally, I bought it for no other reason than being attracted to the album cover art--I had never heard them before). Seriously, I think this album is worth picking up. It is fair to their older style and also a caustic segue into Seventh Son. Some argue whether this is a concept album or not (the concept being time travel), and I would say \\"maybe.\\" If it is a concept album, \\"Sea of Madness\\" and \\"Long Distance Runner\\" are out of place. The others all could be considered \\"time-travel relevant.\\" Perhaps this mild coherence between songs led to the full-blown and subsequent concept album \\"Seventh Son\\" (in which the concept is death/duying/religion/spiritual stuff)--which is bookended by a 20 second creepy acoustic-vocal inclusio.<br /><br />The goods: Sometimes very raw (Title track), fast and heavy (Long Distance Runner), well-crafted (Alexander the Great) and sometimes written with a live crowd in mind (Heaven Can Wait), and other times subdued (Stranger in a Strange Land). I'm NOT with most fans, in that I DON'T care too much for \\"Sea of Madness\\" (bass-line sort of flat), and \\"Deja Vu\\" (just doesn't sit well with me - I can't explain why). However, the guitar solos on ALL the tracks are worth it--especially Adrian's solos. This album, like its predecessor \\"Powerslave,\\" is all Adrian. The high-points of the album are his two solos from \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" although the two guitar solo banter in \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" raises eyebrows even after 20 years. In my honest opinion, this is also the coolest Eddie of all their albums, and the most unique. Perhaps in the wake of Robocop and Terminator, this Eddie may seem a bit passe, but the artwork is magnificent. Eddie as a cyborg robot! Whodathunkit?<br /><br />This one is at the top of my IM list; the others that I would pick up are (at least) Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Live After Death. With these three albums, you've got the high-point of the career of one of Britain's best metal bands.<br /><br />The lowdown:<br /><br />1. Caught Somewhere in Time: 4/5<br />2. Wasted Years: 5/5<br />3. Sea of Madness: 3/5<br />4. Heaven Can Wait: 4/5<br />5. Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner: 5/5<br />6. Stranger in a Strange Land: 5/5<br />7. Deja Vu: 4/5<br />8. Alexander the Great: 5/5<br /><br />And from the B-sides of this era:<br />1. Reach Out: 5/5 - if Maiden had written this one themselves, it would have been a huge hit. I believe that's Adrian Smith on lead vocals, with Bruce singing back-up.<br />2. Juanita: 5/5 - The Charlotte the Harlot theme continues (post-22 Acacia Avenue) with this track. The rhythm guitar is reminiscent of the Powerslave era, and is low and heavy. The lyrics can be somewhat dirty, but it's worth it to hear Bruce's shrieking laughter near the end of the song. You'll know why when you hear it.<br />3. Sherriff of Huddersfield: 2/5 - If the song didn't include Bruce's strange dialogue with himself while the music is playing, this would be a great track. As it stands, it's very, very strange (vocally), but the musicianship is great.<br />4. That Girl: 3/5 - Has a neat guitar intro, but the song lacks that charecteristic Maiden-esque drive that charecterizes most of their songs. The lyrics are not something Maiden would have written on their own, as I believe this is a cover track like most of the B-sides off of Somewhere in Time.<br />5. Total Eclipse: 3/5 - this track is a left-over from the \\"Number of the Beast\\" days. Nothing special.<br />6. Remember Tomorrow (live): 5/5 - Would you like to hear how Bruce sounds singing an under-rated Paul Di'Anno classic? This is it! Very fun song which was sung by IM's best vocalist. They don't play this one anymore, so if you can find a copy of it, grab it.<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!
B000002J03|5.0|In and of itself Led Zeppelin II is one of the top 10 rock and roll albums of the period from 1968 to 1972, which of course means it is one of the top rock and blues studio albums ever recorded. LZ II stands as the pure and unadulterated realization of what all the British blues rockers were trying to attain. Groundhogs, Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin,The Who, Jimi Hendrix Experience (yes, as a British act), Blodwyn Pig, Yardbirds, Rolling Stones (for that specific time span) are all simply amazing when it comes to blues interpretations. We are all better off for these bands. LZ II is the ultimate gospel according to the blues master's own earlier release, Muddy Waters: Message To The Young, he sued them for ripping him off because it is that close to the original but that much more to the sound of the times. Listen to both albums back to back and you will agree that Led Zeppelin really were of the chosen inheritors to what the Blues is.  Not a wrong note and not a mis-step in the whole package and Page and company are to be forever acknowledged as the best of the lot when you need to turn it up and let loose with the sharp guitars and air born vocals, to the hardest, most pounding rhythm section of the time.  <br />Living Lovin Maid is pure rock and pure joy. From start to finish this is an all time favorite and at the top of the chart for any day that needs a lift. Aggressive and full of power chords. This is Led Zeppelin when they are at their rocking finest.
0385510454|3.0|Reading this book, I got the distinct impression John Grisham just got back from a trip to Italy and instead of writing a postcard decided to plunk out a novel. Once upon a time I was a big JG fan; even got his autograph on The Runaway Jury. But I got tired of his formulaic writing. At least with The Broker he veers in a new direction, but the plot isn't particulary exciting and seems incidental to the celebration of all things Italian. Since I listened to the audiobook version, I enjoyed the Italian lessons - such a beautiful language - but I would've been bored reading word after Italian word on the page.
B000002HNR|4.0|Even though it doesn't contain all the hits you'd expect to hear from the Doors like 'Light My Fire' and 'Love me two times', this is still a very good set.  The reason being that the Doors are able to display their obvious prowess as a blues band.  Blues numbers like 'Who Do You Love?', 'Build me a Woman' and 'Close to You' played with a lot of feeling and that makes these songs very enjoyable, even in the absence of the band's usual hits. <br /> <br />We also get to hear fantastic, long versions of showstoppers like 'Five to One' and 'When the Music's over'.  The band is on fire and they obviously relish the chance to spread their wings for a while in these long instrumental passages. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that Jim's poetry, although it is great, seems to be a bit out of place and takes some of the momentum away from the show. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is a great package and it is quintessential Doors.

B0007GAERG|3.0|From those to claim this to be \\"Best Album of the Year\\" to the \\"Worst Ablum of the Year\\" are all off- it's neither.  Although there are great songs on the album, contrary to popular opinion, there are plenty of fillers. In fact, more fillers than GREAT songs. \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" and a couple others are all repeat-worthy tracks. However, Mariah once again fell victim to the overused guest rappers.  Although it isn't as bad as Glitter, (try listing all the rappers on Loverboy), they're unnecessary. In fact, they go beyond unnecessary to detrimental.  \\"To the Floor\\" & \\"Tonight\\" & \\"Get Your Number\\" & \\"one and Only\\", etc. are examples of this.  These songs don't even SOUND like Mariah, and don't give me that crap about how she's evolving as an artist- this is not evolving.  This is her losing her identity as the best vocal female artist to grace the music scene of the modern age. Mariah sounds like a guest artist on her OWN song, for chrissake.  Still, a good, solid effort from \\"The Voice.\\"  Also, I don't understand why her tagline is \\"The Return of the Voice\\"- where did it ever go?  If anything, her voice is fading away, infused into guest rappers' voices...

But the parallels are very obvious to anyone who's seen them. <br /> <br />As 2 people wake up chained to the walls of a toilet of an abandoned factory with a corpse lying in the middle of the room, the expectable questions arise in their minds: \\"How did we get here\\". \\"What's going on?\\". \\"Who is that corpse\\". Soon they find out that they've become a central piece in the game of a psycho who's teaching them a lesson which they don't understand. We as viewers are given more clues to figure it all out than they have, but as the thread unreels we have a disturbingly lingering sense that what we are let to know is pure deception. Their choices? To either kill each other or free themselves by sawing off one of their chained legs. <br /> <br />   Sounds like this could get pretty gory, correct? Not really, as the main premise of the \\"Saw\\" is a purely mental one, in the sense that it's more aiming to be a sarcastic mindgame on the viewer rather than a cheap thrill gorefest. The violence is mostly implied and the violent scenes are actually few (keeping in mind what this could've become).   <br /> <br />    The film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game-maker is. But as the clues pile up and the atmosphere goes from dark to darker so do the twists. Speaking of twists, there are so many here that the script writer walks a very thin line actually. The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done. Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey)  that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock-solid. And even this one mistake will be inevitably excused because \\"Saw\\" offers a tremendous ride throughout to those that like their minds tested. <br /> <br />    This is then the best asset of the film. It's not just a mere \\"whodunnit\\" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time. <br /> <br />    The atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest. You want to see the story unraveling and you become increasingly addicted to the darkness oozing out of the screen. <br /> <br />    On top of that, with the exception of Danny Glover, the main characters are wisely chosen to be 2 not known actors who do a more than just decent job delivering their parts. The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall \\"Saw\\" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion. <br /> <br />   No need to get into the details of the plot here. If you were fascinated by the Usual Suspects and the Cube be sure to see this film. It will be right up your alley.

0393312836|4.0|A Clockwork Orange is a very entertaining novel.  At first I found it very difficult to read through the first few pages, but, well- I can't read slang or pronounce Russian.  I managed pushing myself to read harder and capture every piece of information presented through the novel.  I can't really tell you to much because that will ruin the story but, their is a good and a bad for everything and A Clock work Orange though difficult to comprehend and understand is a brilliant read for everybody.  The main character in this novel is Alex who is a young trouble making delinquent who like to commit crimes and breaks rules well because his gang doesn't have any.  His gang friends are also known as droogs.  He really enjoys his life, which is: raping woman, robbing innocent victims, and brutally assaulting an individual.  This is normal gang behavior.  But one day every thing had gone wrong and caved in on him.  While robbing an old lady Alex had murdered her, his friend's fled the seen leaving Alex to take all of the blame. At the age of sixteen Alex is sent to prison and he stayed there for many years to come until he gets a second chance, an opportunity to do right.  The government is giving him the opportunity to involve himself in a program-one in which he can only do well because the thought of doing evil will make him suicidal.  Anthony Burgess has written a classic novel of good and evil in the prologue an authors not one might say.  Burgess gives the reader input on his book and how he feels about it and his additional ending which was removed from the American version- Chapter 21.  He also mentions something about 21 being the age it takes one to mature and the number of words he chose to end the book with.  Supposedly this is not Anthony Burgess's best novel and it was written in a much earlier time in his life when he hadn't quite matured but it is without a doubt the one book that everybody will remember because of its originality and unique concept.  There is also because they based a movie on this book-Cheater.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is the best album I've ever owned! Filled with suspenceful techno riffs and lush, dense orchestral motivs, this album is a MUST OWN! Buy it and you won't regret it!
0375701427|4.0|Enjoyed the portrayal of the main character, and the changes he went through from his \\"perfect\\" life and \\"exemplary\\" persona, to reality. His daughter was his catalyst, was his dark shadow. Unfortunately couldn't really understand why Philip Roth who kept me on my seat, glued reading this book decided to end it in such a \\"matter of fact\\" way...Would certainly have given him a Pulitzer Prize for the Human stain, but would not truly have thought that the American Pastoral deserved it... <br />Well written, 3/4 of the book is truly stunning, a must read...
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I am eighteen years old and have been listening to Heavy Metal ever since I was eleven. After hearing about this album from my friends and the Internet, I decided to buy it out of curiosity. Was I ever suprised when I put this in my cd player, I couldn't believe I was missing out on such a great band. I like the whole album, but my favourite songs are: \\"Judas Is Rising\\", \\"Deal With The Devil\\", \\"Worth Fighting For\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"Hellrider\\". I also like the dvd that comes with the album. It really gave me a good idea on what the band is all about. All in all, this is a great album for hardcore Priest fans, or a good starting point for new fans such as myself.
B0006GAOBI|1.0|I saw this movie about a year ago because I thought it was going to be a comeback vehicle for Patrick Swayze who is my all time best actor. I celebrate the entire Patrick Swayze collection, my favorites including his portrayal of the post-apocolyptic warrior \\"Nomad\\" in Steel Dawn, his masterful footwork in \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and as a ghost in \\"Ghost\\".  <br /> <br />As of late though, Patrick has been a little bit out of the mainstream, so I figured that Donnie Darko would be his equivolant of Travolta's comeback in Pulp Fiction. Boy was I wrong.  <br /> <br />First things first, when I rent a movie that I hear involves Mr. Swayze, I automatically assume that he will be featured in the lead role. Patrick is a major player that shouldn't be pushed to such a small part in favor of the kid from Spiderman. Where as this kid just mumbled and drooped his way through the Donnie Darko part, Patrick Swayze would have provided much more life and charisma which was sorely lacking.  <br /> <br />Now on to my second (and biggest) bone to pick with the movie. The role that Patrick was cast in seemed promising at first. That is until.....well, let's just say that I'm disgusted with the film industry for the vile direction they made his character go towards. I still haven't decided wether or not I'm mad at Swayze though, since I'm quite positive that had he known what was in store for his character he never would have signed up in the first place. He, like I probably just assumed that he would be playing Darko and that Spiderman would just be in the rabbit costume or whatever. Unfortunately, due to reasons still unclear, Patrick's career has not been revitalized, but instead sabotaged, possibly on purpose.  <br /> <br />Anyways, on to the rest of the movie, summed up as Howard sees it (that's me). Basically the main character is a kid that is crazy and I guess he kind of repeats parts of his life or whatever. And there's a guy in a rabbit uniform after him (not like a sports mascot, much more creepy). I guess from what I gather it's kind of like the movie \\"Groundhog's Day\\" but without Chevy Chase. Oh yeah, and Drew Barymore is in it for like a minute, apparently trying to kill her momentum built up by actual good movies like Charly's Angels. I swear that she was probably only in it to pay off a drug debt or something.  <br /> <br />Now as a Patrick Swayze lover, (no gay jokes please, I know what some of you are thinking and you need to grow up), to say that Donnie Darko is a dissappointment is an understatement. In retrospect I think the best part of the whole movie is when we get to see the wall-sized handpainted mural of Patrick Swayze. If such a thing exists outside of the movie world, I would do ANYTHING to obtain it. I have been searching for a way to get my hands the actual presentation featured in the movie to no avail. When I went on vacation to Universal Studios in Florida I even asked some of the workers but they said they didn't know. I have also written dozens of letters to various art galleries, film studios, video camera manufacturers, and even Patrick himself.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, I am looking forward to buying this Director's cut of the movie just to see if they have fixed any of the problems with Swayze's character, and hopefully beefed up his part. Also the movie could use more action to make it better. That usually works. One way or the other I will at least have a reference of the enormous Patrick Swayze painting, so if worse comes to worst I can at least commission a local artist to recreate it, or even try to paint it myself if I have to. Please e-mail me if you know the wherabouts of this piece. I wonder if it is hanging in Mr. Swayze's estate, which I guess would make me pretty happy. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com <br />
0743424425|5.0|Stephen King's The Shining is brilliant for both its sheer terror and its utter reality.  The Shining is not merely a ghost story, or a haunted house story.  It is a story about people, a family.  The Torrance family is masterfully portrayed; Jack, Wendy, and Danny all come across as stunningly human and real.  We feel the pain of Wendy's hopeless love for her husband, we agonize with Jack as he is plagued by demons from his past and his own psychological instability, and Danny is a lovable-yet frighteningly mature-child.  <br /> <br />It is this truly human aspect that lends The Shining its power.  Jack is not the mindless killer that populates most pulp slasher movies.  He is a real person, unstable and tormented.  In the end, even the reader begins to wonder how much of Jack's madness is ghosts and how much is his own terrifying human flaws.  King has created a brilliant villain in Jack, not because he is so inescapably evil, but because he is so troublingly real. Wendy and Danny are wonderful, as well, but I think The Shining is really Jack's story.  And a troubling one it is.   <br /> <br />The Shining stands to date as one of my favorite horror novels.  King's horror is both real and imagined, and all too often his ghosts and monsters are products of his character's minds.  You will lose yourself in the Torrance family's ghoulish story, and your heart will pound with fear.  But you might also cry.  You might also laugh, and feel real joy with the characters.  Because The Shining is not just horror, it is a grandly imagined story of incredible ambition and capability. <br /> <br />It will remain in your mind for a long time.  If not because of its paralyzing horror, then because of its deeply human messages and impact. <br /> <br />

B00001U0E1|4.0|The first time I viewed Shakespeare In Love, it was a romantic evening, and I think I got lucky.  At my age, I don't always remember.  Anyhow, the babe and I thought handsome Joseph Fiennes a romantic young Bard, and his impossible, indeed, star-crossed love, Gwenth Paltrow, delightful.  For us fellows that have taken up the pen, Shake is a hero, and we're more than willing to imagine our less talented egos upon the master; therefore, making our pathetic literary dreams come true for at least ninety minutes. <br /> <br />The second time around on DVD, ah, a popular Academy Award Winner it still is, but I had more reservations.  You see, I began to desire the real thing.  I wanted to see the actual play.  I loved the set of the old Curtain Playhouse.  I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet as the 1946, Olivia production, Henry V, had duplicated a Globe presentation. <br /> <br />The problem, a lesser farce has been pinned to a great work of art.  It's not the writer, Tom Stoppard's fault.  I panned his Brazil, but I give him marks for a clever recreation of olden times and a romanticized Shakespeare, interesting.  <br /> <br />Oh, Paltrow's hair, long and flowing in her family mansion, short, boy cut on stage, I don't get it.  She wears a long hair wig at home?  However, later on stage, her long hair is exposed.  You couldn't hide all those locks under a short haircut. <br />
B000002AVF|5.0|I have to say that I'm a huge Mariah Carey album, I own all of her major releases, her self-titled through her newest \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" and I have to say that almost 10 years later, Daydream is Mariah's best album. Sure, she's had hits since her 1995 Daydream album but I truly believe that history will look back on Daydream as the apex of her career. The album is very well-rounded starting with the upbeat Fantasy, jumps into a dreamy \\"Underneath the Stars\\" followed by the powerfull ballad One Sweet Day. But she doesn't stop there, the keeps going with a cover of Journey's Open Arms and the classic, upbeat and tasteful Always Be My Baby. This album is so beautiful even down to the old school style Forever and the retrospective \\"Looking In\\" Ten years later, this album is as powerful, beatiful and incredible as the day I bought it in 1995.

0345457684|4.0|This book is a testament to the ability of a single idea to carry a novel.  On its face a simple private-eye story, the central conceit of the novel is the idea that future science will bestow a type of immortality upon the world by merely downloading the \\"soul\\"--presumably the electrical impulses racing around the brain--into a \\"cortical stack.\\"  Indeed, thanks to \\"needlecasting\\" you can be beamed across the known universe into a waiting body without the need for physical voyages; a fine riff on the Star Trek Transporter idea.  Now this idea has been done before, but without Mr. Morgan's careful exploration of the philosophical implications.<br /><br />What is it like to wake up in a different body?  What is it like to be a part of society where others can afford to live in their own bodies in perpetuity as opposed to those who must suffer the indignity of being \\"stacked\\"?  What if a loved one is \\"resleeved\\" in a different body--how does that affect your feelings?  Worse, what if your beloved's body is inhabited by someone else?  How effective is \\"prison\\" when the criminal simply sleeps off the time?  All of these questions are treated and more.  I quite enjoyed the idea of A.I.'s co-existing in society with the humans and having to compete for resources; all they want is to be useful.<br /><br />The story revolves around that idea.  Happiness, true worth and value are not the results of having money, resources, and long-life...  Such are the rewards of being useful and doing good.<br /><br />Now, in a postscript:  The obscenity and sexual content were unnecessary.  Characters can be dark enough without filling their mouths with language that makes me wonder if I should keep the book on the shelf.  As for the graphic sexual content--it was completely ancillary to the story--disturbingly so.  As to the various perversions, let us stipulate that terrible things happen in unsavory and dark locations--don't force the reader to wade through the muck.  As to the graphic depictions of adultery, why not use artful language to convey the emotional impact?  Why must the act be experienced directly by the reader?  The language makes reading this novel like stepping in a dog turd while walking through a fascinating city--the sex like accidentally running into an amorous couple in the park.  Do you stare?  or do you silently wish that they had gotten a room?  One wishes Mr. Morgan all the best but hopes he will stick to developing ideas instead of chasing baser instincts.depictions of adultery, why not use artful language to convey the emotional impact?

B000089RVX|5.0|<br />Evanescence first hit me with the \\"not so brilliant\\" movie of daredevil;and today whenever they say this blind hero's name; i feel so thankfull to him for letting me meet evanescence. <br /> <br />Unfortunetely;Evanescence's Fallen became too famous then they should be.They are a gothic rock band for gods sake;what the hell are they doing among Britney,christina,50 cent and all those other craps from Mtv??? <br /> <br />And there it is;i said the only possible thing that i can say about this album;and it it that it is too friendly,too easy to listen that even kids are singing evanescence songs;which are actually full of sorrow and shouldnt be so popular. <br /> <br />Amy Lee is possibly the greatest voice this world has ever heard. am not saying her voice is the most talented or strong one;she obviously has so much to go;but for gods sake;this cant be the voice of a human! From the angry tunes of going under,to a desperate final help call to god in Tourniquet;from the depths of Amy's personal depression of Hello;to the theme of a final facing with death itself in Whisper;Amy's voice takes you up to heavens;where the voice itself belongs;and shows every single emotion lying in her heart from that respective. <br /> <br />Which is why i cant take such a deep band to be so popular.The album is nothing but perfect;i cant find any other ways to tell it cos it made nearly everyone happy;the band,the producers,the real listeners,the boyband lover girls,the kids,everyone.Next time;i'm sure Amy Lee;(and sorry for not mentioning them,every other member of the band;who are as talented as the vocalist herself)will not try to be so perfect,so radio friendly,so \\"pop\\" <br />next time and give her talent to music history and devoted fans, not to everyone..Untill then; i have to share one of the best bands the world has ever seen with the rest of the world.. <br />
B00004XPPB|5.0|What else can I say that hasn't already been said?  I only just got into Johnny Depp late last year and I've been trying to see the many different roles that he's played over the years.  Depp turns in one OUTSTANDING performance as FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone a.k.a Donnie Brasco.  He gets accepted into a mob family and soon becomes \\"like them\\".  This was my first film I've seen of Al Pacino's.  Pacino was fantastic as Lefty Ruggiero.  Both lead actors turned in the most amazing performances, I was so happy!  I loved this movie so much!  It was actually the first mob film I've seen.  I also liked Michael Madsen's performance as Sonny Black, he was great!  This is a must buy for any Pacino or Depp fan!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|TOAD's 2nd album, Gasoline, is in my mind 50x better than the first one. the debut album was awsome too, but with Gasoline, Tyler, Dave, and Dean (Tim Hart, the drummer quit) experiment with different tunings, melodic riffs of both crunchy rock and hard southern rock. Not only that, but there are more solos in this album. <br />  <br />Their influences come from early 90's hard rock, most noticeably, Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots....although i really dont think they sound like PJ. And everyone compares them to Nickleback which i hate because TOAD is way far more better and diverse, although both bands have similar influences.  <br /> <br />I think the band took their own way with this album, not sounding like Nickleback, but i compare this to STP's \\"Purple\\" in the fact that both Gasoline and Purple have that southern rock flair to it along with some melodies. STP's \\"kitchenware and candybars\\" is the equivalent to \\"Santa Monica\\" or \\"Since youve been gone\\" and \\"meatplow\\" is the equivalent to \\"quiver\\". <br /> <br />1. Hating Hollywood-10/10: great way to start off the album, very STPish, probably my favorite song along with Save the Best for Last <br /> <br />2. No way out-9/10: excellent solo....thats all i have to say, and verrry catcy <br /> <br />3. No suprise-7/10: for all the other great songs on the album, this shouldnt have been the first single, but catchy verse <br /> <br />4. Quiver-10/10: very heavy and awsome lyrics, tyler sings angrily...you could definitely confuse this with STP <br /> <br />5. Santa Monica-9/10: just awsome....very powerful ballad....just powerful <br /> <br />6. Better Off-8/10: very catchy....great lyrics, very uptempo <br /> <br />7. Say Goodbye 7/10: similar to \\"say im sorry\\", could have fit well on first album, proves that tyler is good at writing breakup songs <br /> <br />8. Hello Lonely-8/10: tyler's vocals range a little higher in this song, with an excellent chorus <br /> <br />9. Me and My girl-8/10: love the intro...verypowerful and in your face <br /> <br />10.Since you've been gone-10/10: i should give this an 11, my favorite non-heavy song on the album. this is a song for on the road, driving in the desert in the middle of nowhere. this song gives you that feeling. <br />  <br />11.Hell just aint the same-9/10: great filler song, very country, but its awsome. play it on your front porch. <br /> <br />12. Save the best for last-10/10: probably my favorite song along with Hating Hollywood. crazy guitar slide in the begining, excellent lyrics, excellent chours, excellent everything. <br /> <br />13. In the middle-6/10: This song is okay but i dont think its as good as any other song on the cd. this song should definitely not be at the end, but for what its about, it is just. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!(especially if you are going on a road trip) <br /> <br />...and buy some Stone Temple Pilots!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Bob Clark (R.I.P) has a bizarre mish-mash of movies under his belt, from the cult classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, to A Christmas Story, to this 70's classic- Black Christmas.  Black Christmas is one of the first ever \\"slasher\\" films, but the gore is restrained.  The real scares come from the twisted phone calls, the creepy P.O.V. shots of Billy, and the general clashing of atmospheres.  Bob Clark builds tension and suspense so well, that by the film's climax, you feel as claustrophobic and terrified as the sorrority girls.    A true horror gem, this Bob Clark film should be in every horror fan's collection.  Well written, well acted, and one of the scariest single scences in the history of movies, Black Christmas proves that you don't need a budget or buckets of blood to scare the pants off people.
B000002H33|5.0|Yo, what up? <br /> <br />You don't need me to tell you how great this classic is, the fact is that you could easily put this in top 10 or 20 as far as greatest metal albums go.It was my first metal album and it is definatly the best album Metallica has ever put out (Justice is a very close 2nd) and the songs are just so well done and complex that it is on the thresh-hold of prog metal, but much heavier and faster. This album, Slayers R.I.B, Accept's Restless and Wild, Anthrax's ATL album and MF's Don't Break the Oath is what 80's metal is to me, not gay jovi, motley crap, Ratts @ss or Poison in the ear or any of that false \\"metal\\" that MTV craped out 24/7 in the 80's. The songs here are long as well so your not left wanting more when you finish listening, very good classical guitar parts too. My favoirite songs were \\"Master of Puppets\\" \\"Orion\\" \\"Sanitarium\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\". I know if you like anything remotly interesting in any form of music, then you will like this.  <br />
B0000035E7|5.0|I think this is Nirvanas best album. Its there 1st and best in my opinion. This is a great cd for Nirvana fans but for the people that are getting into them they might not like it, definatly a cd where you like it or are confused by it. Good over all but I just wish they had Grohl for this one, Channing's okay but Grohl is one of the greatest.
0783227434|4.0|Army of Darkness is the third movie in the Evil Dead trilogy, and in my opinion probably the best.There isn't much more i can add to what has already been said here but, this is one of the best parady movies ever made. You have it all here, goofy horror, Three Stooges slapstick action, violent fun with sawed off shotguns and chainsaws, poor stop-motion animation reminisent of 50's monster movies, some of the best one-liners in movie history and a huge cult following. Bruce Campbell was already a star in the b-movie acting world before this,AoD made him a legend. Bruce Cambell is one of the greatest actors of our generation, he is Jim Carey and Clint Eastwood thrown in a blender, combinding a bad @ss atitude with goofy comedic elements and that smirk face he has. For some people this might be way too cheesie, but i would recommend it for any movie collection. When Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrown back in 1399 with his 1972 Oldsmobile, you can tell this is gonna be b-horror D&D and the stooges all rolled into one.
B000003TA4|4.0|This album is mediocre in my opinion. Shure it got alot of media attention but honstly if you want a good cd from nirvana go get Bleach(about a girl is a great song though Chad Channings drumming needs alot of work, no competiton with Grohl). Its there 1st and my favorate. This Cd has some good songs such as Lithium but really I dont think it deserves the 5 most of you give it. I also dont agree with you anit-nirvana freaks who love that craaazy rap along with your head metal. But what ever floats your boat I guess. Over all id say this is a decent cd and by far better than anything Pearl Jam can come out with...
B000056VJ7|2.0|O.K. i discovered this album long ago in my parents CD collection.At the time i was just discovering hard/heavy rock and this album was a recommended listen from my uncle. I always thought the cover looked cool so i decided to give it a try.I have mixed feelings about this album,mosty bad,becuse i felt that it was a crime to have cover art that effing awesome and then have 6 out of the 7 songs being sappy sorry-@ssed love songs or whatever.It does have it's good point(s) though, the first song on the album has to be heard to be belived.The title track \\"Bat out of Hell\\" is one of the best numbers ever, it's full of power,gusto,rage,inspiration and just one of the best songs i have ever heard. The rest of the songs are downright horrible, \\"Two out of Three Ain't Bad\\" is,well,bad and \\"Paradise by the Dash Board Light\\" sounds like one of those horrid rockabilly songs.The rest of the album is just rancid to the point of inducing vommit. It's no wonder in my mind now as to why this guy was pretty much a flash in the pan, he released this in 77 and then vanished for 16 years untill 93's \\"Bat out of Hell 2\\", which was equally as bad as this abortion of alliminum and plastic. Where is this guy today? Well it does deserve 2 stars for the title track anyway, what a great song. <br />i recommend that you download that song and just skip the rest.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|In the tradition of good British romance comedies, in my opinion, even surpasses Four Weddings.  I loved this movie, loved the music, loved Colin Firth with his intelligent, aloof ways. All character bits, down to bridget's relations were all great comics.  'I like it. Very much. Just as it is...'
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|When one thinks of how bad a movie can possibly get, there is atleast some redeeming vaule of getting a kick out of how bad it was.I know there will be people are gonna hate this review but i don't care. After i came out of the theater of this movie i almost wanted to ask for my money back because i felt i paid 8 bucks for essentialy a three-hour nap with the bad after effect of waking up with a headache. There is just nothing going on in this movie at all,even with the star power of Sean Penn and Clint Eastwood as director and a bunch of other hollywood elite, this movie falls flat on it's face.The first 20 minutes and the basic plot was actually well done, this movie could of been good but failed horribly. What you have is one of the most confusing,lifless, and generally pointless stories ever told with an ending that just makes you say WTF? turns out the daughter was murdered by bunch of punk wiggers out on the street.Characters you know nothing about untill the end of the movie and could really care less for. <br />After developing the characters to the point where you think the murderer could be narrowed down to a few characters, and trying analize why they might or might not have done this,it turns out her murder was merly coincidence. They must of got lazy at the end of writting the script because that was one of the worst endings i'v ever seen. not recommended at all.

Although, it might seem a little disappointing for the working women, it does not negate the truth that most of the women try really hard to be moms first and working second (most of the time). This book is at once funny and attempts to be truthful. It is rather depressing at times. But is that not how our lives are ?
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've already seen the movie 4 times.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  Gerald Butler's Phantom is truly magical.
B000022TSH|5.0|One of the classiest movies ever made. Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittis, a private eye who specializes in matrimonial infidelity cases, who stumbles upon a big fish: a murder and a plot to divert LA's water rights for private gain. Faye Dunaway plays a character who has incest to hide. The plot is intricate and multi-layered, and best appreciated after many viewings. Everything works perfectly here - the storyline, the intrigues, even the mystique of Chinatown which figures prominently in Jake's past. Roman Polanski directed and does so with great care and attention to details. Nicholson is riveting throughout, even with that bandage on his nose most of the movie. And that haunting theme music over the closing credits - exquisite! Possibly the best movie in the last 30 years, and I doubt in this age of forgettable trash that Hollywood will ever make as good a movie again. A true masterpiece.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is just so gooood man.  It is hilarious.  It is different.  It is good hearted.  It is Totally original.  It has interesting characters, and it is the bomb.  I love this movie.  I watched it like six times, and it got better EVERY TIME.  I know people that have watched it like 20 times, and just don't get tired of it because it rocks. <br />Yeah, and what's with EBERT.  He obviously does not know what this movie is about.  He too concerned with Kevin Bacon playing a Pedafile in The Woodsman, OOOOOH. <br />The cool thing about this movie is.  Napoleon Dynamite is a rare but definitely real personality.  I know people who talk, think, and have the same expressions as Napoleon.  He did such a good job of imitating these kinds of people!  People who don't like this movie, don't get it.  If you do get it.  You will realize that it is a TREASURE.  GET IT!
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|With the Star Trek film series at an apparent stand-still, it seems a good time to re-examine the various entries;  In particular, the \\"odd-numbered curse\\".  Star Trek: The Motion Picture holds up far better in its director's edition, and Star Trek III serves as a vital and emotional bridge in the original crew's saga.  Then things get complicated.  Shatner's The Final Frontier is an undisputed failure, but one with noble ideas and containing a number of nice character moments (i.e. Dr. McCoy's flashback), and Generations, while squandering a grand opportunity, is still fun viewing.  Which brings us to Star Trek: Insurrection, which is the only one beyond any redemption. And this is because it has no ambition whatsoever.  While the creative staff expressed a desire to craft a more light-hearted adventure, why do it with a story that seeks to create parallels with the forced exile of Native Americans?  The action pales in comparison to First Contact, and the laugh count is non-existent compared to The Voyage Home.  And both of those films managed to have a good deal of heart.  Heart has been a variable factor in Star Trek films, built largely upon the strength of a particular entry's guest stars.  First Contact had three knock-outs in the form of James Cromwell, Alfre Woodard, and Alice Krige.  Following up that, Insurrection boasts Donna Murphy, who is less engaged in the proceedings than Carrie Fisher in Return of the Jedi, F. Murray Abraham, who makes us yearn for Last Action Hero, and Anthony Zerbe, who would fare better if he donned sunglasses and a black robe.  All fine actors, all incapable of infusing energy into a script where nothing compelling exists.  I read a review that called this \\"Star Trek: Save The Hippie Commune\\".  Not far off.  So check this out for completeness sake, and try to find some moments to enjoy (Geordi watching the sunrise).  The good thing to be said here is that Insurrection inflicts no irreparable damage on the series or crew.  Thatwould come with the following entry, that would violate the sanctity of even the even-numbered Treks.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Welcome back Mariah!  This cd has not left my stero for a week now.  This is by far her best album since Butterfly and Daydream.  I'm already pining for the next album!
B00005ASIL|5.0|As many have stated, this single disc CD does not even come close to covering Jethro Tull's 30 plus years in the bussines, for that, even a 2 CD set would seem lacking. But as Tull singer/flautist states in the liner notes, the purpose of this CD is to bring Tull to those who have never heard the band or know only their hits such as Locomotive Breath and Aqualung (both included here, of course). As such, this compilation is very good indeed, and at more than 70 minutes of music, a lot of ground is covered. The songs are not in chronological order but rather listed in such a way that the tracks flow from one to the next, which was a very good idea. <br />Some have complained that 3 of the songs were edited. Well of course! What did they expect? The entire album length version of Thick as a Brick? That way this CD would consist of only 3 or 4 tracks at the most and would defeat the purpose of a \\"Very Best Of\\" CD. Also I'm glad that more latter day material was included, such as Roots to Branches, Steel Monkey and the haunting Broadsword instead of just focusing on their 70s songs. <br />Jethro Tull is a band that is eclectic to say the least even for a progressive rock band and this compilation really gives you a taste of everything, from the folk tendencies of Songs From the Wood and The Witch's Promise (a favorite of mine) to the more rocking tracks like Locomotive Breath (great flute solo!). If you're new to Jethro Tull, you can't go wrong with this one.
B0007GAERG|3.0|This Cd isn't THAT bad, but it's not great either.  I'd call it a cute cd.  And at this juncture i don't know that it's necessarily a compliment for someone of Mariah's so called stature.  I can just hear Simon Cowell \\"you've made it this far, but now we can't remember why we liked you so much in the first place.  It was nice but forgettable.\\" We Belong Together and Shake It Off are cool tracks, other's arent so bad, but there's nothing really great on the album. BUTTERFLY is and will be forever her best cd.  Once she went hip-hop, cant come back to pop from that.  BUTTERFLY, however, had perfect cameos by rappers and the songs blended well. These snoop dog, nelly songs are ridiculous.  They don't enhance the song in any way.  Carey is still doing her whisper thing and then when she's not whispering she's screaming her lungs out (it's like going from the beginning of a janet jackson song to the end of a patti labelle live performance).  And there are  numerous PUNCHES on every track, whereas in her prime she would sing it songs straight through.  It's obvious she does not possess the same control she once had. (JUST GO LISTEN TO THE #1s cd).  This cd is better thain glitter and rainbow, but what's that saying?    Hmmm, who declared Mariah Carey \\"the voice ?  She doesnt have great tone or pitch nor does she project very well unless she's screaming and her voice is incredibly \\"Airy\\"  Whitney Houston at her peak is \\"the voice\\".
0743454537|5.0|This emotional story will stay with you for a long time. Jodi P writes many characters exceptionally well. From the start to the end, it is filled with symbolism and a great love for life. I had to read it twice just to soak in the elegant writing. Although the ending is tough, it is well thought out. Just read the prologue again when you finish and it reveals it all. You will not be disappointed - you may upset and or mad at the end, but what good book have you read that did not make you react. When you are done, you will love and hate the characters all at the same time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|All I got to say is everyone needs to go pick this joint up it's HOT!!.. <br /> <br />MARIAH IS BACK AND DOIN THE DAMN THING........
B0007Y4USW|5.0|First of all, I think that it is my duty as one of Mariah biggest fans to reassure you all that \\"The Voice\\", has always been here. Sure the last few projects that she release, (Glitter Soundtrack) and Charmbracelet, didn't do as well as I think they deserved, but listening to each album you will hear that her vocal ability never diminished. Anyhow, I must say that I was extremely excited about the release of The Emancipation of Mimi, and couldn't wait until the 12th of April so that I could run, get the cd and blast it. OH, MY, GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! Her vocals are strong, her production is sparce, and the control that she has over her voice is better than it's ever been!! It's obvious that she's doing exactly what she feels inside and her cool, fun nature is evident. She sounds more confident than she has ever sounded. I think that this album will allow Mariah to recapture her old fanbase as well as garner attention from those that have dismissed her ability and paid little attention to her in recent years. She's grown confident with herself, and she should. She's bigger than ever, and she ain't goin' anywhere so get used to the sound of her amazing voice.

006441034X|4.0|This book had a very interesting premise: a flying castle. Who has ever heard of such a thing? I certaintly haven't. I wasn't really expecting much when I picked it up at the library, but it turned out to be a very humorous and origional fairytale.   It starts out when Sophie, the oldest of three sisters (so nothing good or exciting can happen to her) is starting her apprenticeship at the hat-making trade. She is very bored and talks to her hats (hah!) about what kind of people will wear them. Soon these predictions start to come true!    One day a beautiful woman sweeps into the shop and turns Sophie into and old woman without so much as a by-your-leave. Sophie reacts by calmly deciding to leave, although her reasons aren't really explained. Meanwhile, a flying castle, said to house a wizard who lures girls in and eats their hearts, is floating around the countryside. Sophie feels less timid as an old woman and walks right into the castle, where she meets the Wizard Howl's apprentice, Michael and a fire demon named Calcifer. Calcifer immediately asks her to break a contract involving himself and the wizard, but he can't tell her what it is about.   After this, things get a lot more complicated. Sophie finally meets Howl, who is not evil at all, though rather vain and a heartbreaker. The castle has one door that opens onto four different places, one in modern day Wales! A scarecrow appears to be chasing Sophie and the King's brother Justin has dissappeared. Sophie stays on at the castle, cleaning, and soon Howl asks her to visit the king to try to beg off searching for Justin. Howl and Michael also get mixed up with Sophie's sisters and they make a trip to Wales, where Sophie sees amazing things and meets Ms Angorian, a school teacher. There is also a dog/man under a spell, and other puzzles to be unriddled.   Sophie stays an old woman until the end of the book, when she breaks the bond between Calcifer (who is really a fallen star) and Howl, and the Witch is defeated. Then everything is explained and everyone has a happy ending. Sophie and Howl finally get together and are ready for a happy-ever-after that will be \\"...a good deal more eventful than any story made it sound...\\".    On the whole a very funny and origional story that turns fairytale conventions on its head. Fans of The Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Wrede might want to give this one a try. Very enjoyable!

0316172324|5.0|Chapter after chapter I had a new insight.  It all gets tied together with the idea that the un-conscious/blink has a mind of it's own..sometimes more insightful than we think and sometimes dead wrong.  Super book if you like thinking.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|No one walks the fine line between reality and fantasy with more charm and twinkle in the eye, than Johnny Depp. He is never overstated or obvious. Rather, he is fanciful, whimsical, impishly smiling and wise but not patronizing or insincere.<br /><br />Depp is sincere. Whatever moment he portrays - Johnny Depp always plays it sincerely.<br /><br />While there were other strong performers in this movie (Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman) they don't matter nearly as much as Depp. This is another world-class performance by one of the best actors of our day. Johnny Depp carries this film from beginning to end - much like Pirates of the Carribbean.<br /><br />A boy at heart, John Barrie does the impossible - he maintains his footing as an adult, successful playwright and husband while exploring the boy within. Whimsical and tender, Barrie encourages and provokes his youthful acquaintances to \\"only believe\\". The tale of Peter Pan was never more finely told.<br /><br />This is a charming film, worthy of watching.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Awesome album..she actually sings in this one unlike the whispering we had on Charmbracelet...Mariah is often imitated but Never Duplicated!!!
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I watched this late at night after a long day and have to say its stark-but-muted drama, with attractive actors beautifully photographed in cool clothes while reciting arch dialogue was a good match for my mood. I didn't have to like any of the characters, I didn't have to be envious of anybody, I just had to kick back and watch them screw each other over.  <br /> <br />Although I had originally kind of snorted at Portman's Oscar nomination I see now that it makes sense. She's not a revelation but she's much better than I expected and she's the human ingredient the movie needs. Clive Owen, too, is great. He looks like he could snap walnuts between his toes.  <br /> <br />A perfect double-feature with last year's equally depressing, equally attractive, equally hard-to-stop-watching \\"We Don't Live Here Anymore.\\" Watch both with somebody you're trying to break up with an they'll be gone before the sun circles around in the sky.  <br /> <br />As much as I liked the movie, I have to say that with all of the characters swapping partners they're a bunch that desperately need an aggressive shower (preferably cold) and possibly a couple of screenings for STD's. \\"Meet some other people,\\" I wanted to say to them. \\"You're Jude/Julia/Natalie/Clive. You don't have to make each other so miserable; there's a whole world of other possibilities out there.\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|After her \\"Butterfly\\" Album, the succeeding album of hers were bad.  Honestly, I had a doubt before I bought this CD, but when I listened to her tracks - WOW!!!!  Her latest album, The Emancipation of Mimi was just awesome.  I think this album is a continuation from \\"Butterfly\\" Album.  Congratulations Mariah.  You're still very IN in the music industry....
0316172324|1.0|No wonder Michael Levine salivates whenever you mention this guys name. They both have the same approach to writing books. Take a bunch of ideas that are already out there and try to make it sound like they are your ideas. I believe that here in American we call that plagiarism.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to legal students looking for case studies in plagiarism, and if you really want to see plagiarism at its best then be sure to read Guerrilla PR by Michael Levine--it is STOLEN entirely from Jay Conrad Levinson's Guerrilla Publicity.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi is the best ablum of Mariah Carey! I thought that I was going to be disppointed because of her last album, \\"Charmbracelet\\", but then after listening to her second single of this brand new CD, \\"We Belong Together\\" I felt that Mariah had changed her style a bit, still the R&B vibe in her, but she didn't use that whisper-type of voice she used all the time in the albums beginning with, \\"Honey\\". This time, she really sings out the word, there are some background sound and a song or two that does have that whisper voice, but she mostly sing it out loud like she did in the time before 1997, which made me fell in love with her voice. I have been a Mariah Carey fan since I know what music is, and that is in 1995 (I am fifteen). She has a really unique voice that you can distinguish between other singers; you can tell that Mariah is singing when you hear the song. Plus, after that many year of experience, she knows what she is heading for (first album in 1990).<br /><br />The songs in this ablum is full of beats and soothing music, plus an excellent voice, of course. Some of the slow song have her old pop style in it, not all r&b. Here's the rating for each song.<br /><br />1. Is Like That- 5/5: The first single. A upbeat club-style song. She is talking about self through the meaningful lyrics.<br /><br />2. We Belong Together- 6/5: Probably the best song of the year. Second single off of this ablum. She completly sang this song instead of using that whisper voice.<br /><br />3. Shake it Off- 4/5: One of the slow-upbeat song. It's a bit more of a r&b song than pop, her current style.<br /><br />4. Mine Again- 5/5: I love this song! It should be make into a single. Anyway, it reminds me of her really good song, \\"My All\\". It it something similar, but with a different vibe and a lot more strong.<br /><br />5. Say Something- 4/5: Another club-mix, with a sexy beat!<br /><br />6. Stay the Night- 5/5: Another fave from this ablum, really meaningful with a \\"My All\\" kinda feeling in it...<br /><br />7. Get Your Number- 4/5: A cool upbeat r&b song.<br /><br />8. One and Only- 3.5/4: An ordinary slow song. This song is one of the few that she used that whisper-style voice.<br /><br />9. Circles- 4/5: One of those oldie kinda style of her, something that remeinds me of, \\"Someday\\" but really, it is different from that though.<br /><br />10. Your Girl- 3/5: Kinda like one of her old songs from the \\"Charmbracelet\\" ablum, the old r&b.<br /><br />11. I Wish You Knew- 4/5: Is okay, has a singing-live sense to it, because there's all these applause and stuff.<br /><br />12. To The Floor- 5/5: really upbeat, plus Nelly is great...a club-mix that make me wanna dance.<br /><br />13. Joy Ride- 3/5: Perhaps the weakest song in this ablum. The song is weak, but of course, her voice pull it back up.<br /><br />14. Fly Like A Bird- 4/5: The old Mariah 98's, said to be her favorite song recorded on this ablum.<br /><br />Get it!!!n it... <br />7. Get Your Number- 4/5: A cool upbeat r&b song. <br />8. One and Only- 3.5/4: An ordinary slow song. This song is one of the few that she used that whisper-style voice. <br />9. Circles- 4/5: One of those oldie kinda style of her, something that remeinds me of, \\"Someday\\" but really, it is different from that though. <br />10.

0316168815|5.0|When asked what this book is about I have answered: It's about a little girl who's raped and murdered. <br />And people get shocked. How in the world can such a horrific plot be something you recommend. <br />Because I do.  It is hard to imagine that such a tale could be beautiful and touching.  A page-turner that one simply has to finish at one go yet when one does it's with a sigh of regret that you put it down. <br />Alice Sebold is proven herself to be a master of story-telling by writing this remarkable, unique book.  She takes a subject that is appalling in reality and spins with her magic pen a tale that holds you captive until she gently put down on the ground again. <br /> <br />The text flows beautifully, effortlessy across the pages and one always is thirsty for more. <br />The story itself is so original. A little girl is raped, then killed and after that watches her family from above, to see what happens to them. How the tragedy affects them and how they deal with it, each in his or her own way. <br /> <br />The characters are always believable and always real.  After a while one starts to feel you know these people and you feel deeply for them and for the little girl. You feel so angry, betrayed and outraged over the tragedy that you could scream! And then you want to cry.  Unsurprisingly, there were many tears shed over this book though not all in sorrow.  Because there is, in spite of everything, joy to found on these pages.  There are victories, big and small and when they come you share those feelings that come along with them. <br /> <br />The author did a fine job of creating a good setting, she doesn't go into much detail but leaves a lot up to the reader which is good in my opinion. Not too much and not too little. <br /> <br />After I had read the book the story stayed with me for a long time. It is without a doubt one of the most memorable and best books I have ever read.   <br />I can't recommend this book strongly enough. It is simply extraordinary.
0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold yet again takes you through a rape case (like in Lovely Bones) only this time it is not fiction. Lucky takes us through the aftermath and hardships Alice herself suffered after her traumatizing rape as a naive college freshman. Attempting to handle evrything herself and acting she is fine causes her to go down some wrong paths in attempts to put her attacker behind bars. Suprisingly this memoir keeps you turning the pages as Alice returns to school, struugles with making new friends, and the trial. This brave young author stood against all odds in hope that the justice system could prevail, not knowing that after the trial things are still not better. This crimes leads her down a wrong path until the point she realizes that she is not completely over the rape (post-tramatic stress disorder). <br />      Alice Sebold depicts her bravery and her strong-will in sharing a very personal crime with the world and going along with the trial in the first place. Rape is a horrible thing and Alice shows us just how horrible of a thing it can be. Lucky shows the world that rape can happen to anybody and that everyone should fight for justice.

038551123X|2.0|The good news first. Author Jeff Lindsay's brainstorm to have a psychopathic serial killer as a protagonist - a man driven by his own \\"Dark Passenger\\" to kill, dismember and gift wrap the victim's body parts ever so neatly, never leaving a drop of blood behind, is brilliant. Even more unique, is the author's ability to endear said protagonist, Dexter Morgan, to his readers. Why, Dexter is extremely likeable, sympathetic, even loveable, at times. Women think he's sexy, and his adopted sister dotes on him. He even has a decent sense of humor, dark, of course.<br /><br />Dexter was adopted at the age of three by a cop, Harry Morgan, after an unexplained tragedy orphaned the boy. Harry watched carefully for potential psychopathic behavior from his foster son. Even though the child could not remember what happened to him during his first years, before he became a Morgan family member, his adopted father understood that it would be highly unusual if the child escaped his early experiences unscathed. What occurred before shaped Dexter, no matter how hard Harry tried to straighten him out. So, when Harry discovered that his son, now fourteen years-old, had a history of killing animals, he sat him down for a heart-to-heart. The older man knew that Dexter was really a good boy. Although he is devoid of human feelings, Dexter had learned to fake them quite well in order to fit into society. He sincerely cares what his mother, father and sister Deb, think of him - this is the closest he will ever come to having emotions and feeling love. Harry and Dexter decided that when the need to kill pushed Dexter to look for bigger and better prey, he would learn to channel his urges, control them, and choose his victims carefully, to make sure they would be the scum of the earth - other serial killers, rapists, child molesters, etc.. See, he can murder and dismember to his heart's delight, with every full moon, and still be a good guy??<br /><br />Eventually Harry and his wife die leaving Deb and Dexter on their own. Dexter Morgan is now a highly regarded crime lab technician, specializing in blood spatter analysis for the Miami Police Department, where his sister, Deb, works as a policewoman. She has aspirations to become a homicide detective and get out of vice ASAP, where she presently works, dressing night after night like a flashy hooker, patrolling the worst sections of Tamiami Trail, \\"bait on a sting,\\" catching unsuspecting johns. Dexter is supportive of  Deb and wants to help her achieve her goal. He has assisted her before on cases, as, oddly enough, it is not difficult for him to enter the criminal mind and predict behavior, to the best of his ability. Psychopaths can be helpful to society too.<br /><br />A new kind of serial killer is at work in Miami, who leaves his victims, all hookers, on or near his sister's turf. Dexter, almost always in an apathetic state, becomes fascinated by this monster, who also dismembers his subjects and arranges them in grisly positions. Their modus operands are extremely similar. He feels admiration for his fellow predator and believes the psycho is reaching out to him, trying to tell him something. Dexter is torn between \\"doing the right thing\\" per Harry's long ago instructions, and assisting his sister, or finding the killer to express his sincere admiration at his craftsmanship. There is a third possibility here, one too terrible to contemplate - could this murderer actually be our very own Dexter, performing the deeds during periods of sleep or blackouts?<br /><br />On the downside, Mr. Lindsay's narrative style is overly simplistic, and at times, melodramatic. I don't have the patience to read this kind of dumbed-down prose, no matter how many gruesome car chases are involved in the plot. The author's pop psychology leaves much to be desired, as does any character development one might find in the novel - I couldn't see a three dimensional individual for the life of me. I really cannot understand thisbecause almost all the primary characters have much grist for the mill in terms of background material, their earlier lives. Some really relevant, interesting stuff is covered in just a page or two. I believe Lindsay's second book, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter,\\" will be out in July 2005. It is not uncommon for series books, which start out quite flawed, to improve greatly with practice. I don't think I will look into Dexter's further adventures, however - not while such brilliant writers as Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine are around to provide really outstanding psychological thrillers. There are just too many superbly written mystery thrillers already on the shelves for me to waste precious time on books which don't make the grade, no matter how original the premise.<br /><br />JANAnderstand this because almost all the primary characters have much grist for the mill in terms of background material, their earlier lives.

B000002KIE|1.0|this band inspired the work of some favorite bands of mine, but when i listen to it it just makes me cringe.  try playing this in a crowd and everyone will go silent, in an  embarressed, awkward way (I have actually seen this happen, even when half of the crowd had an affiliation with punk music).  the medium is extremely terrible, childish, dumb, and represents the stupidity of the 70's.  No, I am not a fan of good charlotte, I hate them too.  But I am here to say that the whole genre of punk music is an embarressment and an atrocity to all great music, truly an atrocity of the highest order.  They have perverted music into a disgusting creation that ran out of control, and now everyone ignores great artists like Benny Goodman and Muddy Waters in favor of crummy sound bite grating.  FOR SHAME! <br />The only remotely good \\"punk\\" band is the Clash, and only because they incorporated other styles into their music to save the limited chord changes that abound in normal punk music.  Save your money and get London Calling! <br /> <br />Johnny Rotton is a fool of the highest order.  He murdered his girlfriend and was always a pathetic washed up junkie.  His blasphemy of music you have no need of in your collection.  His protests seem childish now, and you know what, THEY WERE CHILDISH ALL ALONG!!!  All you fools can go live on the streets now, you don't deserve the blessings of society!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This is really the very best from Mariah in years!! She is back singing with her incredible voice!! The songs are very creative, original and satisfies all styles, from big ballads (in this album we have one of her best ballads of all time, this is called Mine Again) to uptempos and Hip-Hop, without forgeting the classical R&B. Mariah shows how she is incredible talented in singing, writing and producing songs! This album is a must have to all fans and non-fans that apreciates good music!!
B0000256VK|4.0|the arrangements and production on this album are simply astounding.  the engineers obviously took great care to make sure this album had near perfect sound, which it does.  The last Roxy album, and maybe even the best, Avalon is full of wonderful compositions, some better than others.  I don't really think there is any filler, but I find myself returning to the first 3 tracks and skipping a few at the end usually.  I haven't listened to this one in awhile; its one of those albums that you never let go of because sometimes its just perfect, but other times it may not be.  I highly recommend this album, and Country Life for the new fan.
B0007P3582|1.0|Check it out, im a no-talent hack that has the same bewildered look on my face in every picture.  I also love guns because that shoot hot pieces of lead that send me to the hospital and cause me to speak and rap like I have a severe mental deficiency.  I have run out of subject matter to rap about and see myself being overshadowed by more talented artists, so I now just insult other rappers and celebrities (not that they don't deserve it) with my slow and idiotic rhymes in an attempt to extend the life of my fame.  I will probably get fatally shot in the next few years as the result of my stupid disses and then the massive amount of disillusioned fools who loved my \\"work\\" will start to compare me to 2pac, Biggie and Big L.  Many remix albums will come out and you will buy every one to complement your wack music collection, whereas you will then be inspired to grow up and be a simple-minded moron, leading a fools existance and enthusiastically supporting Jeb Bush if he ever runs for president.  G UNIT!!!!!
0393316041|5.0|this a terrific book about Feynman's life, and not an overview of the ideas he had that got him a Nobel prize.  he is a person who cannot be boxed up or pigeonholed, and his many zany adventures make for good reading.  Even someone who didn't go to MIT or learn advanced mathematics can relate to Feynman's unique approach to life, and his wonderful ideas.  Highly recommended reading for every type of person.
1400031354|5.0|Tears of the Giraffe is the second book in the No.1 Ladies Detective agency series. Once again, Precious Ramotswe is back solving crimes along with her newly-promoted secretary. As in the first book, the descriptions of life in Botswana, Africa are wonderful. Africa is more like one of the characters than just the location of the series. The writing is so lyrical that I've been tempted on more than one occasion to pack up and move to Botswana myself. A beautifully written book, and I'm looking forward to reading the third installment in this series.
B000002GFC|4.0|now I do admit that the remastering on this cd could be better, especially on \\"I feel free\\" and \\"strange brew,\\" where the drums are practically not there in the mix.  But other than production quality varying slightly from todays high standards, this collection is monumental.  It captures all of the great cream songs, like \\"white room\\" and \\"crossroads\\" and a personal favorite of mine, \\"politician.\\"  If you are into classic rock you need this cd.  If you want only the very greatest hits, the top 6 or so songs, they are on Cream of Clapton in better sound quality.  I suggest you get that one also, because it shows the rest of Clapton's great music that he made after Cream.  But by all means, get this cd.  You will always enjoy having it around.
0395645662|4.0|The Giver <br /> <br />By: Ying Yang Chan <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> I was reading the book the Giver. What I am going to talk to you about today is why it is so hard to make connections to a world that is all black and white world where everything is exactly the same. I don't understand why a good author like Lois Lowery would write a book with really no good connection able to be made to the present time because it is all the same. I mean if you have an assignment where you have to make connections from your book to the present time you wouldn't be able to do the assignment because you can't make connections to the story.I think that teachers shouldn't recomend the Giver because of that simple fact you can't make any good connections. I thought the Giver was a good book and all but I just couldn't relate to it. i think that if Lois Lowery (Giver author) made the book  a little bit more realistic and really able to happen more kids would read it more because they would be able to relate to the story. So in this last sentance I will tell you if you like to read science fiction/ fiction you should read the Giver. Also if you like really in-depth books you should read this book because Lois discribes everything perfectly and you are able to picture everything very easily. <br /> <br />-Ying Yang Chan <br />
B000002IAZ|5.0|this band just rocks, and they craft wonderful songs that i didn't know I liked before I picked this up.  This collection does a terrific job of bringing all of the best from the band onto one cd, not too difficult seeing as they had only 3 albums.  If you have just heard the name, or heard only one of the songs, do not hesitate to pick this up; every song is wonderful and really fun to listen to.  all are great examples of the best of the country rock movement, ready for you to enjoy.  Make it a priority purchase.
B0007P3582|4.0|This was my first 50 cent cd so I didn't expect to much and I didn't think too much of it. the massacre is still a good cd but dont expect alot of massacre songs. most of this albumb sound like the love below cd that outkast's andre 3000 put out. thier are a few gangsta songs in here like in my hood, when the gunz come out, gatman and robin(which is a little retarted),and I don't need 'em. most of the songs are notin but sex. disco infreno was a good dancin song too. but the real prize to this cd was the remix to hate it or love it feat. g-unit. <br /> <br /> this is a cd worth buyin.don't listen to the other people.
B0000TB050|5.0|Great great concert. As has been said, you can just SEE the emotion of the concert, as well as being able to hear it.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase if you're even a little bit of a U2 fan.<br /><br />Hardcore fans -  why have you NOT bought this yet??
1400032717|5.0|The bottom line of this book is that Christopher is just plain funny.  He doesn't mean to be but the way Mark Haddon writes him, the things he has him do and say and think are funny.  I laughed out loud all the way through this book.  Haddon is a clever story teller and I loved his way of writing.  I read this book in no time flat because -a- it is an easy read and -b- it is impossible to put down.  Get it, read it and enjoy.  I think you will!
B0007GAERG|5.0|First let me address that I am a MAriah Carey fan but I can keep it real. Mariah hasn't had a decent hit since her Rainbow CD not that her music in between wasn't good but something was missing... her powerful voice. <br />On this album Mariah listened to the fans and concentrated bringing back her old fans and gaining new ones. It's like that starts the CD off right and the CD doesn't stop bringing hits! <br />There is a old school R&B vibe of music along with hip hop and classic soul mixed in. Her CD to me gets better at the end (since slow jams are more my style) and she puts her Mariah stamp all over every track. <br />Nelly,Twista, Snoop, and JD all helped but Mariah is the star herself and shows why.  <br />Mine Again is the best song here on one of the best all time <br />Favorites: We belong together, Mine Again, Shake it off, Stay the night, and I wish you knew... basically the whole CD! <br />THis CD is the best R&B CD since Fantasia (I haven't got the Faith Evans cd) and every fan should pick it up. <br />THe Diva is back at the top where she deserves to be.
0395645662|4.0|Jonas lives in a community that can't see in color. He is just like you and me except that he is able to do a lot of things that nobody can do. He is the only one that can see in color. In the book he received memories and ran away to help his community. Jonas is a brave young man. <br /> <br />Jonas took on the responsibility of receiving the memories. He didn't have to do that job. At the ceremony he could have said he wasn't going to do that, but he didn't. Next, he went to the Old Receiver and he told Jonas that he would experience great pain. If I knew something I was going to do would involve a lot of pain, not just physically but emotionally, I wouldn't want that job. But Jonas didn't mind, he was willing to do all of this for his community. <br /> <br /> To help his people he ran away from the town. The Old Receiver, which he called The Giver, told him that it wasn't fair to him or Jonas to be the only ones that had to keep the memories. The people needed to know about other things in the world than just their community. Jonas broke so many rules that he lost count when he escaped and had the community see all of the wonderful and horrible things in the world. This took a lot of courage on Jonas' part. <br /> <br />        Jonas was very brave. He willingly received the painful memories. In the process, he helped his community. On the way Jonas became braver. Jonas is a very good character. <br />

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|The word art is sullied with numerous derogatory connotations by the vox populi.  It has become habitual for people (callow reviewers who sputter inane opinions through an internet-based retailer) to deride any work they do not fully comprehend.  Without question, some work is not intended for some people.  Narrow thinking requires equally narrow answers, therefore those of us who raven for substance have to search elsewhere to sate our appetites.  Often a work comes along that precipitates a great diverse outpouring of thought.  The reception for said works is usually demarcated into either of the following camps: those who persistently laud the effort, showering it with the kind of encomium usually found in the gnarled tongues of pamphleteering zealots, or those who contemptuously debase the film - their efforts being only to tear down the exceptional work that they have not the temerity nor the initiative to create (see the rebuke of blue velvet as supplied by that stammering lout roger ebert - ugh, my spine shakes in contempt for him...ugh).   <br /> <br />Blow-up is a shining example of this.  It repulsed as many critics as it attracted.  Even the curmudgeonly sour-crotched crone Pauline Kael took time out of her busy schedule of ridiculing Woody Allen to praise the film.  Mostly, i think, this is due to the singular nature of the film.  There is a very isolating aspect to it, where the viewer has to be appeased slowly, nourished sporadically by only meager bits of action, and have faith vested in the competence of the director.  Nothing really happens in the film until the final scene, where the main character dissolves in a verdurous field.  It's akin to Videodrome in a way, where the ideas that the film presents are infinitely more potent than what is shown on the screen (though the vagina on james woods' chest tends to linger). <br /> <br />Ostensibly, this film concerns a murder mystery.  A virile, young photographer in mod london is taking pictures in a small secluded park.  In the middle of photographing an embracing couple, he is pursued by the female party.  She implores him to hand over the film, vaguely ranting about all of the complications in her life, how she doesn't desire anymore.  He stubbornly refuses to acquiesce to her demands, responding that it is his obligation to take such photos.   <br /> <br />Certainly, this would appear suspicious in the minds of an audience and its implications are numerous.  However, this element of the story is barely utilized.  It is touched upon briefly, as we see the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) only once more.  Instead the film follows the photographer through his hedonistic trysts with lascivious young would-be models.  It is only later in the film that he develops the pictures which seem to suggest malice.  Yet even upon contemplating such foul goings-on he seems unperturbed, not in the least deterred from his usual behavior.  He doesn't think for a second of the victim or the perpetrator, his thoughts are solely centered on what these photos could do for his career. <br /> <br />Blow-Up is exceptionally well made.  There are certain moments when the camera flits with the kind of terpsichorean grace of a ballet dancer, moments where the viewer is given an exhilerating sensation throughout their body (especially the scenes of the main character driving around in his car), moments that are so exquisitely shot it's difficult to imagine anyone having such a perverse distaste for the film.   <br /> <br />At the conclusion of Blow-Up i was effected in a way few films have ever effected me.  It belongs to an exclusive dearth of films that have sent my thoughts soaring and given me a renascent vigor for the artistic efforts of others, a film that further braced my intractable faith in cinema.  It is indeed an arduous film to sit through for the casual viewer, as it doesn't offer much in external action.  However, the way it questions our perceptions of reality (which i wouldn't dream of spoiling) with that one scene at the end completely (to me) vindicates its place in the venerable pantheon of great films.  The fact that a film can so succinctly but precisely capture the nature of existence on celluloid is as good a reason as any to seek out this film, given that you are the kind of person to do so.  I think people have a genuine aversion to that which they are incapable of processing.  Instead of meditating on what aspects of the film they don't comprehend, they are wont instead to throw nothing but slander and scurrilous accusations its way, moaning about pretention and pseudo-intellectualism.  Those people obviously don't understand Antonioni's work, nor will they ever if they remain so obstinate in their narrow mindedness.
0790749556|3.0|If you are expecting the operetta Roberta, you may be disappointed. Although the story is basically the same, the stars of this movie are Astaire & Rogers, (Huck & Liz) who were secondary parts in the operetta. In fact, John (the male lead of the operetta) doesn't sing and his songs have either been eliminated or are sung by someone else. Also, it is badly in need of remastering; the audio is poor and the video is fuzzy in spots. Nevertheless, it has good dancing and good music. I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD.

If you're into easily digestible pop fiction (DaVinci Code...blah), or your eyes glaze over when you pick up a book exceeding 200 pages, or you are not tolerant of geek lore, then you MAY NOT enjoy The Cryptonomicon.

0671027387|1.0|This book is TERRIBLE!  It is implausible, unsuspenseful, and just plain ridiculous! I mean could you really take a book seriously where the main characters fall into the frigid arctic sea on the tip of a broken off iceberg only to be saved by a passing submarine?  Or where a ship is sucked down to the depths of the ocean by a giant swirling whirlpool (ala The Little Mermaid)?<br /><br />I barely got through this book.  I put it down on several occassions and only finished it because I needed a good laugh and to find out what the next unbelievable scenario the characters would get themselves into.<br /><br />One question after having read Da Vinci Code:  Why do people continue to buy and read Dan Brown books?
B0007GAERG|5.0|GRAMMY MATERIAL!!!!!  There is no other like Mariah.  It's like listening to an Angel sing.  Her voice is unique from all the other power house female vocalists.  It's powerful but at the same time has an innocence, softness, clarity, beauty, and tranquil quality that is so completely mesmerizing.  She is unparalleled.  This is why no contestant on AI has ever attempted to sing one of her songs.  Mariah is simply untouchable.  She is an amazing talent that can sing, but can also write & produce her own songs and has done so from the start of her career.  She debuted at #1 her 1st week on billboard.  As for all the haters.... screw'em....it's not worth wasting my time.  I just skip over their reviews, because obviously they need hearing aids.  First, I think this is the best album of her career.  It's hard to decifer because I love them all, but MC has really hit the jackpot with this one.  It's a real work of art that offers an assortment of beautiful ballads and addictive dance/club/R&B tracks.  Her next single should be either \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", or \\"Stay the Night\\".  As always her genuine & sincere lyrics are well written, mature, articulate, and conveyed with pure emotion.  I also love the angel-like look of the cd cover.  She looks absolutely beautiful.  As I previously mentioned, I have alot of respect for Mariah because she is the only superstar songstress that utilizes every aspect of her talent in writing and producing her songs (w/ the exception of Christina[Stripped] who is beginning to).  This cd is magnificent. GO BUY THE CD & LETS CONTINUE THE #1 REIGN ON THE CHARTS.  GO OUT & GET IT NOW!!!!!  YOU WILL LOOOOOOOOVE IT.....I'M BACK.... SHE HAS SLIPPED TO #2 ON THE BILLBOARD THE 2ND WEEK, WHICH IS STILL RESPECTFUL.... BUT WE NEED TO HELP HER REBOUND BACK TO # 1.....PASS THE WORD....WE HAVE TO SUPPORT HER....

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|QOTSA is another band that comes out with a great album and makes you think, \\"How can they top this one....\\".  My favorite is still Rated R, but Lullabies To Paralyze is probably my second favorite. <br /> <br />Homme is an amazing song craftsman.  He gives QOTSA their own sound.  Although, on this recent effort, there were 2 bands that came to mind after hearing a couple of the songs.  Burn The Witch reminds me of Cream.....needless to say, an amazing band that made there own sound.  And then Skin On Skin reminds me of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. <br /> <br />My favorite on this album is Tangled Up In Plaid....just a stripped down amazing riff. <br /> <br />These guys rule.  As far as musiciansghip goes, I think they're right up there with the boys of TOOL.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a fantastic CD. For all you true Mariah Carey Fans, trust, you will not be dissappointed. People forget that Mariah Carey, like Whitney Houston, never wanted to be a pop star. She just wanted to sing RnB. It was the record companies that wanted to shape and mold these two great singers into Pop Diva's. It's no wonder Whitney's suffering drug addiction and Mariah had a nervous breakdown.    Some of these one star reviews are like the reviews that were given to Destiny Child's \\"Destiny Fulfilled\\". Again, people forget that like Mariah and Whitney, Destiny Child was and will always be a RnB Group and don't you ever forget it.     In 2004, the top three albums were Teena Marie's \\"La Dona\\", Patti Labelles \\"Timeless Journey\\" and Stephanie Mills \\"Born Again\\" ...In 2005, THE BEST CD so far, Mariah Carey \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" and from what I've seen for releases this year, I don't think none will come close. Now, if you don't already know this, you will now, get into it, dammit!!!     On Mariah's first album, she co-wrote most of her songs with Ben Margulies who is a caucasian guy from England with whom Mariah had a long time friendship with and before she became famous she and Ben use to play in clubs around NYC singing and playing RnB. Do you get it? If you don't, then get this, like Teena Marie, Mariah's the Brown Sugar covered in Snow and RnB is deep inside her SOUL, and all you Pop Music Lover's who want Mariah to go back to singing Pop Songs get over it, because Mimi has been emancipated and she is doin' her THANG!!! You Go MiMi!!!     Now, here is a bit of information you may or may not know, get ready to gag. I heard the entire album on aol before it was released and for every song that was about to play, Mariah's voice came on to tell a little history about that song you were about to hear. Did you know that the music for \\"Joyride\\" was written by a fifteen year old girl and was almost scratched from the CD because the manufacturer's had lost the track and the master had almost been completely damaged. Mariah had to go back and redo the song in three parts and record all three separate parts together to get one track, it was so much work to save this song that they almost didn't release it on the CD. Thank GOD they did, because that note that she hits at the end of that song and holds it till her vibrato kicks in......That in itself is worth both buying and having the CD in your MiMi collection...... Enough said.....

B00005NGAL|5.0|The `Cats' DVD is a cinematic record of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical as performed on the London stage in, I believe, 1998 starring Elaine Paige in the `lead' role of Grizabella, although the only aspect of her role which warrants calling it the starring role is the fact that this character sings the `show-stopper' song, `Memory' which, if you are to believe writer / director Kevin Smith's bit in `Jersey Girl', has become a real Broadway clich&eacute;. The show is the most truly `ensemble' performance I can think of. Few characters stand out for more than the length of a single piece, yet practically all characters are on stage for over 50% of the two-hour performance. Aside from Paige, the only character / actor who is remotely familiar to me is John Mills who is on for but two scenes and who is more of a prop than a character.<br /><br />I make a strong point of the fact that this is a recording of a stage performance rather than a conversion of the play to a more realistic environment. This conversion is done for most Broadway plays turned into movies, especially for big musicals such as `Oklahoma', `The Sound of Music', `My Fair Lady', and `Chicago'. But this conversion is not always successful. That is, the very big realistic setting is not always an enhancement. My best evidence for this is the film done of `The Fantasticks' with a cast including such high powered talent as Joel Gray and others. As someone how has seen the play done on the live stage three times with three different interpretations, including a performance by the New York City cast, I can say that the movie failed to breath any life into the classic minimalist staging it gets in intimate little theaters. The movie was simply not as good as the live performance. This is clearly not the case with this DVD record. It gives us the stage fantasy that needs practically no embellishment with a real ally or cinematic whiz-bang.<br /><br />Like `The Fantasticks', I have seen `Cats' on the New York stage sitting in a mezzanine seat about 4 rows from the back of the Winter Garden theatre. And, while there is something about a live performance that simply cannot be recorded, I will say that this DVD (and VCR) recording is quite as good a record as you can get.<br /><br />My most important criteria for evaluating a movie on DVD or VCR is whether or not the work wears well after the second or third or fourth viewing. For example, `Chicago' was fun to watch once, but I have no burning desire to watch it again. On the other hand, `Singin' in the Rain' I can watch about once a year and still find the time well spent. I will say with great conviction that I can watch this recording of `Cats' once a year and enjoy every minute spend with the experience, because I have done so over the last few years. The performance and its record are so durable that my second most important criteria for a DVD, a good commentary track, becomes unnecessary. And, the commentary track is basically a waste of time for a musical anyway, especially a musical based on famous poems written 65 years ago by the most notable poet, T. S. Eliot in `Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'.<br /><br />The play has the thinnest of plots based on a once a year selection of one Jellicle cat to ascend into some state of grace, presumably at the conclusion of their legendary nine (9) lives. The only other plot twist involves the kidnapping of the head cat, Old Deuteronomy, thereby preventing this feline apotheosis from being carried out.<br /><br />This accounts for four or five out of the nineteen numbers. All the rest are based directly on fourteen out of the fifteen poems in Eliot's little book.<br /><br />One may think that this work has but a single hit song and, therefore, the remaining musical numbers are second rate. This is certainly not the case. I find myself tapping my toe to all numbers, with especial pleasure coming from `Jellicle Cats', `Mungojerrie and Rumpleteaser', and `The Pekes and the Pollicles'. These are much more like stories in song than a simple ballad with easily remembered refrain.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for anyone with a taste for musicals and worth a try for anyone who likes fantasy.nd the Pollicles'.

6304712936|5.0|`Amadeus', a play about the adult life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart written by Peter Shaffer, with the film version directed by Milos Forman won an Academy Award for best picture plus seven other Academy Awards. And, for someone who saw the play on Broadway with the dynamic Tim Curry as Mozart and F. Murray Abraham in the role of Salieri, a role he repeats in the film.<br /><br />For starters, the movie definitely benefits from being moved from the stage to the real world of 18th century Vienna, played by the older sections of 20th century Prague. I am just a little disappointed that they couldn't convince Vienna to play itself in the movie, but Prague does an excellent job, as it was the third major city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire when Mozart lived.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that, believe it or not, most of it is based on verifiable historical fact. The remainder is based on legends about Mozart and Salieri that may or may not have been disproved. Mozart was every bit as much of a musical genius as he is presented in the movie. Reliable sources also state that he was quite crude and had a rather vulgar sense of humor. His interaction with the Archbishop of Salzburg and the Austro-Hungarian emperor are all accurate, or at least accurate enough in general to provide a sound skeleton to the fictional dialogue and some of the more speculative events. Salieri is also a thoroughly accurate historical figure who was the emperor's court composer and who did write many operas. His being lost in the dust of history is also quite accurate. If you are lucky, you may be able to find some DVDs of his operas in bins of works by Mozart's contemporaries. The story of whether or not Salieri actually had anything to do with Mozart's death or with Mozart's composition of his unfinished requiem is entirely a part of legend, at least according the Encyclopedias I have consulted. I have not read any biographies of Mozart, but I suspect the Britannia got it right.<br /><br />Since Tim Curry did such a good job as Mozart on the stage, I was just a bit surprised to see the part of Mozart go to an almost totally unknown actor, Tom Hulce, whose main role up to that time was as the wimp, Flounder in the great comedy, `Animal House'. I will assure you that Hulce gave the role everything it needed, more than enough to erase my recollection of Curry's interpretation of the role. As it turns out, Forman wanted to fill all the roles with relatively unknown actors, except for the central role of Salieri, taken by Abraham, who did it on the stage in New York. Oddly, Hulce seems to have disappeared from view shortly after `Amadeus' was released. Aside from Abraham, the most familiar faces are those of a very young Cynthia Nixon who plays a minor role as a maid and Vincent Schiavelli, a character actor in `Taxi', `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', and dozens of other small parts.<br /><br />Aside from the very large, believable palate offered by Prague, the best part of the transition from the stage to the screen is the chance to do full justice to Mozart's music, performed by Mozart specialist Neville Marriner in all its symphonic and operatic glory. The things the DVD can do with the music make it especially valuable to trade in your VHS for the DVD. I would go so far as to say that if a youngster needs some inspiration toward the appreciation of great music, you could do a lot worse than sitting them down in front of this movie. It almost makes me wish we could get some of Mozart's operas on DVD.<br /><br />The music contributes to the rewatchability of the work but since, unlike `Cats', for example, the music is only one subject out of several in the movie, the work may not be quite as rewatchable as an out and out musical play. Yet, I still watch this movie an average of once a year for the last six years, since I owned a copy of the VCR before I got the DVD.<br /><br />Worth the purchase if you like the movie or the music.vie or the music. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000003S0P|5.0|1974's \\"Red\\" is King Crimson's seventh album, and the last one they made before disbanding for seven years. The core of the band was now reduced to a trio---guitarist Robert Fripp, bassist/vocalist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford, although the group are augmented on the album by such players as David Cross on violin and Mel Collins on sax. \\"Red\\" is another Crimson classic, featuring tough-as-nails prog rock and great musical beauty as only Crimson can do it. The title track is a scorching instrumental rocker, one of Crimson's best and most enduring numbers. \\"Fallen Angel\\" and \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" also flex some tremendous musical muscle. \\"Providence\\" is a very intriguing improvisational piece, and the 12-minute finale, \\"Starless,\\" is a great, powerful song, with an excellent vocal from Wetton. At the time, \\"Red\\" seemed to mark the end of King Crimson, with Robert Fripp eager to move on to other projects. But Fripp, thankfully, would resurrect the band in 1981 with \\"Discipline\\" (featuring the debuts of guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew and bassist Tony Levin). Although time proved that it *wasn't* the end for this great band, King Crimson closed out the first phase of their enduring career with \\"Red,\\" a fantastic Crimson album all the way.
B00025ETIW|3.0|although this album is good for the typical emo kid, i could understand if any1 with a different music taste would h8 this... i keep an open mind to all types of music, this is a ok album but doesn't deserve the attention it is getting. i saw these guyz live, they have alot of energy and are very dramatic but the lead singer simply can't sing... my favorite track is thank for the vemon, this is because it reminds me of thrice which are a good band. but wat ever i wouldn't admit i like these guyz if some1 asked me.
B00066N8JS|5.0|In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the release of \\"The Downward Spiral\\", it is being reissued in two new formats:  a two-sided \\"DualDisc\\" containing bonus video materials and this two-disc set which comprises a SACD surround-sound mix of the album and of lots of extra audio tracks from that era.  This review covers the two-disc set.   <br /> <br />Reissues are a huge money-maker for (mainly) labels and (sometimes) artists.  They're also a mixed bag for the fans who buy them - at their worst, they amount to a $15 donation for a \\"remastering\\" that's indistinguishable from the original and some new liner notes.  This is not the case with the SACD surround-sound mix of TDS.  This edition puts the focus where it belongs:  squarely on the sounds pouring into your ears.  Because I didn't know what to expect, I was a bit cynical about what kind of difference the surround-sound mix would make.  It only took one listen to determine that the difference is immediately real and makes a familiar piece of music into an intriguing experience.   <br /> <br />While you will need a surround sound setup to hear all that that mix offers, don't be discouraged about equipment requirements - I've listened to the album on a number of configurations (actual SACD playing through 5.1 channels, regular CD playing 5.1, regular CD playing 2 channels), and each of them sounds superb.  Even in the car or with headphones, details that had been lost in the original mix are now clear and distinct.  On heavily layered tracks such as \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\", this jaw-dropping mix gives the sound so much new texture it's difficult to believe that it's just a remix and not a re-recording.   <br /> <br />The only disappointment with this set is the disc of extra audio materials.  Aside from a trio of demos that only a fanatic completist would love, there aren't any previously unreleased tracks here;  everything can be found on the singles and EPs release during the TDS era.  Nonetheless, it's convenient to have them collected on one disc and the new mix of \\"Burn\\" from the \\"Natural Born Killers\\" soundtrack is as good as any on the main disc.   <br /> <br />The mix on this two-disc reissue of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is an landmark achievement - it manages to pay homage to the original work while reintroducing it in formats that almost define it as a completely new recording.  It sounds cliche, but no matter how much you've listened to the original recording, you've never really heard it until you experience this mix.  It is simply a necessary investment for any NIN fan.  It is also an excellent place to start for anyone just discovering Trent Reznor's magnificent work, although more casual fans may prefer the single DualDisc edition that includes DVD video content such as the clips for \\"Closer\\" and \\"Hurt\\" at a lower price.
B0007GAERG|2.0|i have been a mariah fan since vision of love.  this album is not good at all.  Her voice is amazing as usual but the songs are just too \\"today\\", too \\"bubble gum.\\"  This album is no different than an Ashanti or Beyonce album.  This album will not stand the test of time.  I was very bored and disappointed with it. I will be a Mariah fan till the end but in my opinion Butterfly was the last good album she put out.

B00005JN0T|5.0|I, Robot, starring Will Smith, should be the shining example upon which Hollywood basis all of its Science Fiction films ripped from the pages of great authors. <br /> <br />Although quite obviously given a generous helping of special effects, the producers managed to stay true to the overall tone and theme behind Asimov's stories.  <br /> <br />James Cromwell in particular is wonderful with his portrayal of the enigmatic scientist/hologram Dr. Alfred Lanning, adding the necessary elements of wonder and mystery to the concept of the spontaneous development of Artificial Intelligence.
0452283760|5.0|So, I'm your typical leftist student, three years into university with some vague philisophical ideas and a love of literature. One thing that I thought I knew was that I hated Ayn Rand (who I'd never read). So it goes.<br /><br />This opinion was not totally unfounded. She is often cited as the philosophical inspiration of such reactionary political figures as Reagan, W. Bush and Thatcher (amongst others). People whos Randian beliefs in \\"freedom\\", free markets and \\"small government\\" led them to dismantle state institutions (all around the world) that help the poor, the down and out.<br /><br />I still don't believe in those people or those policies, but this book changed my life. (I sound like a commercial for the Bible, but honestly this book had an incredible impact on my thinking). Throughout the book, Rand extends a metaphor equating the creation of architecture with the creation of the self (emphasizing strength, coherence, simplicity and stability) which I found insanely compelling. Her ideas on pressure and tension; production and value; freedom, charity and self-reliance are all worthy of study and reflection. They have influenced me and my values immensely.<br /><br />In her works, I found many of the aspects of Rousseau's Emile and Social Contract, of Marxist thought on materialism, of Nietzsche's individualist thought which had appealed to me for so long.<br /><br />As for the book itself (and its relation to the philosophy), Rand's writing style is only fair. Her plot and structure are simple, rational and coherent, reflecting her philosophy. Her characters are poor. While Roarke is a truly admirable hero, he would have been far more compelling as a tragic hero. His  unrealistic success seeks to redeem (unnecessarily) her philosophy. Thus, in Rand's work (unlike life), the weak and (therefore) villainous are always punished by themselves and society; the strong and rational succeed and maintain their dignity. To this end, the other \\"bad\\" characters (Keating, Toohey, etc.) are unreasonably presented as completely self-aware of their flaws, and thus seem almost inhuman to the reader - a device employed to distance the reader's sympathy from other philosophies. For example, Toohey is consciously Rand's idea of the Communist Ideal: turning society into one large person, in order to control it. This simplistic stylization makes Toohey inhuman; and his defeat seems both just and symbolic of Communism's necessary defeat. Rand's philosophy, while compelling, is unrealistically presented in the plot and characters of The Fountainhead.<br /><br />However, overall, my point is this: do not dismiss Rand out of hand. Especially not based on ideology. Although she is quite biased in her writing, her work is clearly powerful, it is not merely the empty rhetoric employed by many who follow her philosophy. It deserves consideration.onably presented as completely self-aware of their flaws, and thus seem almost inhuman to the reader - a device employed to distance the reader's sympathy from other philosophies.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah, welcome back, girl. You have been a source of inspiration for most of my life and your work continues to provide the soundtrack of my life. \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" is a long overdue masterpiece. Thank you for sharing your heart, mind, and style with me. Carey on. <br /> <br />Because the style of \\"Emancipation...\\" is such a departure from Ms. Carey's other work, comparing them is challenging. However, this album is one of my all-time favorite albums. The lyrics are heartfelt, sassy, and intelligent, while the melodies and beats make an indelible impression. I can not get them out of my head. Mariah has chosen a different musical path. Consequently, many fans of her earlier work are disappointed and longing for another \\"Music Box.\\" The whole industry has evolved; you will not hear another \\"Music Box\\" or \\"Emotions\\" for quite a while. The new beat-driven and edgier style is very resonant with me. <br /> <br />This CD sounds nothing like Beyonce's or Ashanti's. The only element of this CD that is reminiscent of Beyonce is the album cover. It seems that many have forgotten that Beyonce, Ashanti, and all of the others have adopted chapters our of Mariah's book of style. She pioneered the pop& rap collaboration...well before anyone else. Everyone wants to sing and be as fabulous as Mariah. She is an icon. She owned the 90's and, with \\"Emancipation of Mimi,\\" evidences that her reign will continue. <br /> <br />While it is fair for someone to not like this genre of music, it is not fair for these people to critique its works. What sense does it make for a person who hates Country music to review Country CDs. All versed in hip-hop and R&B clearly see that \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" leads the pack. Mariah has, again, raised the game and provided inspiration for legions of imitators. <br /> <br />I have grown with Mariah and have not limited myself to the 90's. This is a new millennium. Trust Mariah, and she will lead us to sonic nirvana.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah's 10th studio album is a hot compilation of searing collaborations! You have got to own this record! A virtual who's who of r&b/hip-hop royalty, featuring the likes of Snoop, Jermaine Dupri, Twista, Kanye West and Nelly, the album is literally a treasure trove of hot hits. The top 10 dance track and first single, It's Like That, is in a word, awesome! The second single is poised to become this year's prom favorite with its easy-going ballad style and Mariah's soothing voice.   \\"To the Floor\\" is an original-sounding club-hit-in-the-making that I look forward to blasting from my stereo on Friday and Saturday nights or anytime I feel like dancing.  Mariah continues to display on \\"Emancipation...\\" her special genius for blending different styles to create a unique sound for her songs. This is also an album that has something for everyone, the dance fans, the ballad fans, the belting fans, this album has it all.    You have to buy this album to hear for yourself just how good all the songs are. Every one of these songs is a certifiable hit!  And fyi, Mariah never went anywhere, this album proves yet again, as her last one, that she was always at the top of her game, musically. As an artist she has never stagnated or chosen to remain cloistered in a particular genre. She is a pioneer of the genre-breaking or genre-bending styles that seem to be flourishing these days. You don't know what to call it, you just know it makes you want to get up and dance! And yet, no one ever gives her credit for that. Listen to \\"Mimi\\" and get emancipated! This album is a perfect portrayal of the talented voice that charmed millions around the world from the moment of her eponymous debut to her latest hit single; and the genius artist who continues to push the envelope in bringing an original sound to the world.
0930289234|5.0|Read this classic graphic novel with a knowledge of its time....fear and paranoia towards the threat of nuclear war, assassinations of presidents, a lack of trust of those in positions of power in the age of media and subterfuge, and vast modernity sprawling out and producing crime and disillusionment.......Alan Moore takes on all this pessimism and shakes it down with the Watchmen, using the conceit that costume heroes actually exist and are everyday people. The hallmark is that not much here is black and white. The result is a confronting, engrossing, extensive work, which re-invented and challenged the genre and promotes the necessity for individual opinion in readers, by leaving so much firmly in the grey.<br /><br />In the end we are left to think about whether or not 'The end can justify the means'....and there is a strong echo of Hiroshima here. Obviously it can't..and must never. But here, a global solution to focus people's attentions away from war was to introduce something alien. The question of 'Who watches the watchmen?' underpins and concludes the whole book. It is one of power and responsibility, and the idea of the Watchmen being free from this, to act freely, and to have greater influence than those people who are restrained from acting properly by their systems and nations, is portrayed with unfortunately, similarly threatening results. It can only prompt individual thought and better collaboration through its lesson.<br /><br />Although it can be a bit too indulgent, and the 'comic within a comic' is given too much space, other elements that should attract you are its realism, its character depth and the unique figure of the Comedian. The Comedian has limited hope for the world; he is the ruthless, Batmanesque, out-for-himself, vigilante. He has seen 'its true face'. He fascinates us as we read The Watchmen, because he goes to a deep place in the comic and in everyone's thoughts, where our attempt to rationalise the horrors and behaviours in ourselves fail...where he 'plays along with the gag', working as a unique force of truth, which is without morals, because there is no hypocracy where there are no morals......The uncompromising Rorschach observes and echoes this. It is where the beginning and the end of the book lie....It is a flawed world, not a good joke....but it is better to play along....?lves fail...where he 'plays along with the gag', working as a unique force of truth, which is without morals, because there is no hypocracy where there are no morals......The uncompromising Rorschach observes and echoes this.

B000001Y42|1.0|d Durst and his friend Sam Rivers on bass. Rivers' cousin John Otto soon joined on drums, and guitarist Wes Borland completed the original foursome (later supplemented by DJ Lethal). After Korn played the Jacksonville area in 1995, bassist Fieldy got several tattoos from Durst (a tattoo artist) and the two became friends. The next time Korn were in the area, they picked up Limp Bizkit's demo tape and were so impressed that they passed it on to their producer, Ross Robinson. Thanks mostly to word-of-mouth publicity, the band was chosen to tour with House of Pain and the Deftones. The label contracts came pouring in, and after signing with Flip/Interscope, Limp Bizkit released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill Y'All. By mid-1998, Limp Bizkit had become one of the more hyped bands in underground rapcore, helped as well by more touring action -- this time with Faith No More and later, Primus -- as well as an appearance on MTV's Spring Break '98 fashion show. The biggest break, however, was a spot on that summer's Family Values Tour, which greatly raised the group's profile. With their major-label debut, Three Dollar Bill Y'All, Limp Bizkit quickly rose to the top of the alt-metal subgenre known as \\"rapcore.\\" They have been one of the biggest disgraces to music since Milli Vanilli. Pathetic Vocals, terrible instrumental playing, and the lyrics....OH MY GOODNESS THEY ARE BY FAR THE STUPIDEST THINGS I'VE EVER READ AND HEARD! This is as about as pleasant as getting a papercut on your eye. This is a must avoid piece of junk!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a novel intended to inspire and bring about the childhood innocence that is contained within everyone.  The story takes place in the small town of Maycomb County in Alabama.  Being raised into a modest lifestyle, Scout Finch lives in a world that, in the beginning, she knows very little about.  Her only concerns  are the time spent playing with her older brother Jem and her best friend Dill (while wondering what really is inside the Radley home) and listening to the wisdom of her father Aticus Finch. <br />   Over a short period of time Scout is forced to grow up very quickly and she learns some of life's most important lessons.  From witnessing first hand the unfairness of racism, she also learns a great deal about others and how you don't really know someone until you have walked in their shoes.  Scout also learns to view people for who they truly are.  She looks for the \\"mockingbirds\\" in society, those who are truly good at heart and don't deserve the cruel punishment that society imposes upon them. <br />   I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars because it is although it may be a simple book to understand the messages sent are great in importance.  I really liked this book at would recommend it to anyone. <br />
B000294SFW|5.0|I love Mot&ouml;rhead. There's something about this album that just does it for me. I think it is because it's Mot&ouml;rhead. They have great music while still pounding dirty and nasty rock. Another plus is that while I don't mind, there is no parental advisory on this CD. That just shows how much you can rock without dumbing down your lyrics. I saw them live, and besides getting my ass handed to me, I loved it. It just proved that the louder you play this the better. I like how this CD has that Mot&ouml;rhead sound while still being fresh. Mot&ouml;rhead is what I have been searching for! They're good rock without the \\"mainstream\\" fanfare. Rock. Track 3, turn to level 11.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I personally don't really care if the science in this show is real or not.  That is not the point.  The point is, Mac is able to think clear and fast on exactly what needs to done and the exact methods to carry them out, all \\"under extreme pressure\\".  However, you don't see Mac as a grumpy, depressed person.  He is actually optimistic and willing to help others.  Even though he is not real, his attitude towards life is nevertheless, worth a lot of admiration.  He is quite popular in Asia too ^_^   <br /> <br />If Paramount can sell it with Chinese subtitle, I am sure a lot of fans in Asia will also buy the DVD.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I\\"m so thankful for this album.  It's so fresh, up beat, and cool.  Even the Gospel song has a jazz flair to it.  I have been a huge fan of Mariah for a long time, and it's nice to see her come out with an album that is so hot.  I suggest buying 2 copies, one for the home and one for the car.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I was so excited for this album and I was not dissapointed at all. It has so many amazing and beautiful songs.  She sings in her full voice for most of the cd and her voice is stronger than ever. I have been a Mariah fan for a long time and I think this is some of her best work, best vocals she has done in awhile. I love all her cd's but The Emancipation of Mimi has shot to the top of my favorite Mariah albums, right up there with Butterfly. I recommand this album to mariah fans, and anyone who loves strong vocals. This album has it all. Standout tracks to me are We Belong Together, Get your Number, Stay the Night, Joy Ride, Fly Like a Bird, Mine Again....okay, the whole album stands out =)
B000059HAI|2.0|There are many things for which TORA, TORA, TORA is worthy of praise.  It is an historically accurate film and many regard it as a triumph of history over Hollywood entertainment.  For all of those who have recently trashed films like THE PATRIOT and U-571 for the ridiculously one-sided storylines they offer, this is the film they are looking for.  TORA, TORA, TORA provides a balanced perspective on the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese are depicted as real human beings in this film and we are reminded of the reasoning surrounding their attack.  On the flip side, the lack of American concern and preparation is communicated as well, suggesting that some of the damage incurred on that day was due to mismanagement problems.  I was quite impressed with the way that a balanced history manages to come through in this film.  Additionally, I was struck in awe at several points (such as when the Japanese planes are taking off from their aircraft carriers) and was forced to imagine what it must have been like to have witnessed it.<br /><br />However, for all of its achievements, I question TORA, TORA, TORA's effectiveness as a motion picture.  For my money, I would rather see character development and a personalized story in a major motion picture.  As some reviewers have commented, the only real star in the film is the special effects during the battle sequence.  Essentially, TORA, TORA, TORA feels like a documentary.  Of course, isolating personal stories during a war can lead to over-the-top, feel-good-about-America pictures and I am certainly not recommending these types of films.  But one does not have to sacrifice interest and character development when making an historically accurate film.<br /><br />Moreover, TORA, TORA, TORA seemed far too long.  Several scenes could have been effectively edited down to a fraction of their length and the battle sequence at the end, while thrilling, is painfully long.  In this way, the film manages to convey the depressing magnitude of the attack simply by making us watch it for thirty minutes.  Another example occurs during a scene I enjoyed in which the Japanese airplanes are taking off from their aircraft carriers.  The scene is beautiful, particularly with the sun just beginning to rise on the horizon.  But did we have to see every plane take off?  Is five minutes of planes taking off the most effective use of time?  I do not think so.<br /><br />Overall, TORA, TORA, TORA is a great achievement in historical accuracy and I think it should be shown in history classes.  I just do not think it will be shown on my own television screen that often.  It lacks the character development, emotion, and pacing to deserve that honor.o convey the depressing magnitude of the attack simply by making us watch it for thirty minutes.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Actually, I admit that Mariah is a great singer and a great performer as well. But in this album she showed somewhat like below the fans could expect from her... <br /> <br />Her vocals is strong, but there is something missing on the songs. That thing is a primary factor for us listeners to keep listenin to it. In general, the songs sounds a little to extracuted from the spectative circumstances of a real good song. Sometimes, you don't even now how it really sounds, and sometimes the songs aren't really focusing on the theme the song must be. <br /> <br />Another reason is that we keep listening to the same Mariah Carey - the songs are too typical from her pasts albums. An example is \\"Say Something\\", which is very near sounded to \\"You make Me Wanna\\" rapping and vocals. I have to say that Mariah must come up with something fresh and new, and with another astonishing concept. <br /> <br />The first single \\"It's Like That\\" is somewhat cheesy and cute, but the sound isn't dancable - not enough funk. Her vocals and the lyrics are great, but the treble of the song is midtempo - somewhat boring for the ears. To introduce an album, you must have an all-hype song or an uptempo song. In that way the album might be contrary to best and not far off than rather. <br /> <br />That's my review for \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\"
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I have to say that... although I am not a very big fan of Mariah's this is one of the best albums I have heard in years.  It is better than Jlo's, definitely better than Destiny's Child and ... who knew MAriah could do it like that? <br /> <br />Wow, the songs are just amazing. You can't skip a song, they are all so well done.  Mariah really did it this time, I guess years of being a pop star have really served her to see what is necessary. <br /> <br />Emancipation is worth every penny....
B00079018K|5.0|First of all, I think this is a great CD. I just love the sound. I don't really care if its \\"retro\\" or \\"garage\\" or whatever. I really liked Club Foot but was worried the rest of the CD would suck ... well I was pleasently surprised, the rest of the CD is just as good! <br /> <br />Now about the protection, I really hate this kind of thing since about 95% of the time I just want to listen to MP3s of my music that I have PAID FOR. (I am in no way advocating piracy, I just want to listen to my music that I've purchased how I want to!) <br /> <br />So, here's how I easily made mp3s of my songs. First download Exact Audio Copy, a free MP3 making tool. Be sure to get version 0.95 pre-beta3. This version is no longer available on the EAC site but the filename is eac095pb3.zip so do a search on it. Download and install it. Go through the config wizard, you may have to install an MP3 encoder (ie \\"LAME\\") if you don't have it installed already. <br /> <br />Next start up EAC *without* the music CD in your drive. Then insert the CD and let EAC read it. Then if its protected the tracks will be listed incorrectly. Go to \\"Action\\" at the top, then choose \\"TOC Alterations\\", then \\"Detect TOC Manually\\". Let it do its thing, and it will detect the actual tracks. Then just pick the ones you want and hit the to-MP3 button. Voila! (Note that you need the specific version mentioned above because for some reason recent versions do not have this option!) This process worked perfectly for my Kasabian CD. Note that you can change stuff like bitrate by going to \\"EAC\\" at the top, then \\"Compression Options\\", \\"External Compression\\" tab. <br /> <br />Hope this helps. In sum, CD good, protection bad ;)
0393312836|3.0|A Clockwork Orange is a gruesome story of a teen living in a futuristic world in which the streets are ruled by chaos and violence.  The protagonist(using this term loosely) is named Alex and is the leader of a street gang who spend their time fighting, stealing, and raping.  This goes on until Alex is caught and put in a program designed to reform him.  A Clockwork Orange is an interesting, but disturbing look into violent criminal actions and a desire that is can only be motivated by an obvious lack of a moral compas.  If the reader can get past the excrutiatingly frustrating use of random slang dialogue and the graphic depictions of rape and other violent crimes, then A Clockwork Orange is a very interesting read that reallly forces one to take a look a the violence in our own society.  A Clockwork Orange was not an easy read, but it was still a very interesting one.  Therefore, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I'm glad I did not listen to some the negative reviews. If you're looking at this you probably appreciate Eric Clapton's genius. This album is a faithful tribute to the roots blues that has inspired Clapton throughout his career (and numerous others). If you're looking for Cream: put on Disreli Gears, don't buy this album. If you're looking for adult contemporary, this is not the album for you. This is the music of an authentic American genius as delivered a faithful student, and a master in his own right. I'm enjoying a great deal.
B000002U82|5.0|\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is timeless; the songs, the cover art, everything. It's depressing and pessimistic, yet uplifting and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br />\\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\" is a lush, mellow piece of light psychedelia to open things up. Great song, but it only gets better. \\"On the Run\\" is electronica via 1973. Then, the cacaphonous symphony of clocks which open up \\"Time\\" kick in. It's a classic rocker, ranging from heavy and bitter to soothing.. <br /> <br />\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" is a haunting piano piece, featuring Claire Torry's show stealing singing/shrieking. It's really quite majestic. <br /> <br />Everyone knows \\"Money\\" - 7/4 time (or is it 7/8 dammit??), bluesey licks, cool solos; a classic psychedelic grind. \\"Us and Them\\" is another classic whose slow verses build nicely to the soaring chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Green is the Colour\\" is one of the lesser known cuts on here; it's an instrumental, akin to spacey jazz fusion. Groovey, man. The finale is the anthematic, pseudo-title track \\"Brain Damage\\" (a fitting tribute to Syd Barrett), and the also anthematic coda, \\"Eclipse\\". <br /> <br />It seems almost pointless in typing a review for an album that nearly everyone in the world owns. But for those who don't, believe the hype. A timeless masterpiece.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I watched Schindler's List several weeks ago, but many of the images still keep coming back to me because it is a very powerful movie that stays with you.  I can recall vividly as the young Jewish engineer was shot because she had the gall to suggest a change in the construction of a building.  I can still see the scene where Schindler tricks the commander into spray the hot cattle cars with water so the Jews trapped inside could get a little relief.  There are many more scenes that will stay with me for years to come. <br /> <br />  I first viewed Schindler's List to show to my advanced English as a Second Language high school class after they had read Anne Frank:  A Diary of a Young Girl.  I knew that it would help them get a deeper understanding of World War II and its atrocities.  I was right.  From the moment the movie began, the students were mesmerized by this film.  They didn't even complain that it was in black and white.  The horror the film depicted kept them interested and wondering how and why such a thing as the Holocaust could ever have occurred.  The film made an impression on them. When we resumed watching the last part of the movie after Spring Break, I asked them if any of them had thought about the film over the break and some of them had. It's not always that high school students will admit to mulling over something that they have been doing academically! <br />   I believe that this film tells volumes about the Holocaust that sometimes history books just cannot make real for students.  I recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to be moved by the wonder of humanity (as in such a man as Oskar Schindler) and to anyone who wants to help others understand the atrocities of the Holocaust so that such a thing may never happen again to anyone.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I absolutely adore this woman's talent and how she continues to mature personally and professionally in a very classy way. When I first heard, \\"We Belong Together\\", I didn't recognize her voice right away but knew it was familiar. The song struck so many emotions within me. I loved it and promptly went out to purchase her CD as soon as it was released. I hope MARIAH keeps keeping on!  Mahalo, Mariah! I will always remain an amiring fan.
B0007GAERG|1.0|It is a very well known fact (and has been posted all over the internet) that Mariah's record company paid Roger Friedman (a laughed at entertainment reporter) from Fox News to hype this album up a month before it's release. They probably had to pay the very few critics who gave it good reviews. Most hated this album and they were right. Mariah Carey doesn't sing. Instead, she screams and screatches like a little puppy. She has employed various rappers to cover up for her lack of vocal talent. \\"It's Like That\\" might have been a good song had a real vocalist been employed to sing it..not an aging 45 year old washed up has-been.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a book that is sure to draw interest and suck the reader in within the first chapter. The main character, Alex is a very intriguing character, he's a propper boy by day and a violent madman by night. It's perfect for readers who are looking for a little bit of a challenge, with most of the script in the Nadsat (teenage) language. This book will have you guessing what extreme thing will happen next, it's good to the very last page.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I had high hopes for this album, since I'm a big Maiden fan and their previous album (Brave New World) surprised me by being able to hold its own against their early successful albums. But somehow DoD doesn't deliver for me. It's not bad, but it just doesn't stick out, doesn't have much uniqueness in it, feels too repetitive. They showed with Brave New World that they can revive themselves, so I hope for a better next album.
0316666343|4.0|This is a heart-wrenching story of a young girl being brutally raped and killed. After her death readers see Susie watch her family from heaven. Her family deals with Susie's death and reaches a breaking point. The family falls apart while Susie observes in what she calls \\"her heaven\\". This story will make you laugh and cry. This touching story is highly recommended because it gives a new prospective on death, as well as how people deal with such a tragic event.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I definitely like this album, doesn't feel as repetitive as some of their earlier works. It's better than Fear of the Dark and X-Factor, though I like both of those, too.
0783225881|5.0|Kevin Costner is as perplexing as a Rubik's Cube (at least it was tough for me to figure out.!).<br /><br />Here's a guy who starred in perhaps two of the worst films ever - \\"Waterworld\\" and \\"The Postman\\" and yet was single handedly responsible for the epic masterpiece \\"Dances With Wolves\\".<br /><br />And, of course, this beautiful film - \\"Field of Dreams\\".<br /><br />I'm not going to provide a recap / synopsis of the plot - that's been done very, very well by many of the reviewers here.<br /><br />I guess it was inevitable that I would feel a connection with this movie. As a guy who grew up living in southern California, I fell in love with baseball at a very early age. In fact, as a youngster / teenager, it's all I can remember doing when I wasn't in school. I guess I was a decent player because I was scouted by the Cincinnati Reds and offered a minor league contract.<br /><br />I was also a teenager who had a very difficult and, at times. estranged relationship with his father - which is the \\"sub plot\\" at the heart of this magical story. And in view of the fact that my dad passed away about a year ago, needless to say, the ending depiciting the meeting of Kevin and his dad can certainly trigger alot of emotions in me.<br /><br />When you really think about it, this movie could have failed so easily. For example, it could have tried to \\"explain\\" the magic of the cornfield - or Costner \\"going back in time\\" and meeting Moonlight Graham, superbly played by Burt Lancaster. And if it had tried, it could / would have lost all credibility. Because there is no \\"rational\\" explanation for the events depicted in this film.<br /><br />Instead it didn't even try - the events just happened and if you didn't \\"feel\\" the magic because you were too busy trying to understand the logic of it, you would be the poorer for it.<br /><br />As a Red Sox fan, I also loved the fact that Costner had to seek out James Earl Jones in Boston and actually attend a game at fabled Fenway Park. Could you possibly imagine these two characters attending a game together at some modern behemouth stadium and buying into the notion that something \\" supernatural\\" was happening. Personally, it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact.<br /><br />Let me make another recommendation - consider purchasing the soundtrack to this film as well. The music provides a perfect backdrop to the wonderful feeling conjured up by this movie, especially the long last song which is played as Kevin and his dad meet again.<br /><br />At a time when movies rely so heavily on special effects in order to mask the fact that there is no plot. Or that studios just keep on pumping out horrid sequels in a blatant cash grab. Or studios are so devoid of original ideas that they have to make films of tired old television series i.e Charlie's Angels / Mod Squad / Starsky and Hutch - it's an absolute pleasure to watch a movie that's so original and so fresh that it's like nothing you've ever seen before..!!<br /><br />Or are likely to see again.<br /><br />This is a very, very special movie and if Costner was to spend the next 30 years making turkeys like the Postman, at least we would always be grateful to him for this gem.ether at some modern behemouth stadium and buying into the notion that something \\" supernatural\\" was happening.

B0007GAERG|5.0|The CD is really good! If you like Mariah, you're gonna like this. I'm a big fan and the only song I didn't like was track 04, 'Mine Again'. The rest of the cd, in my opinion, is great.
B000002H33|5.0|I just got into metallica recently and i think there music is great. This is the first album i bought from them. <br /> <br />1. Battery - This song starts of slow and then goes into fast paced trashing. great starter. (5/5) <br /> <br />2. Master of Puppets - My favorite part of this song is the intro. i also like the section in the middle where it slows down. this song really kicks arse. My favorite song on the cd. (5/5) <br /> <br />3. Thing that sould not be - this song is not one of my favorites. It feels long and is not very catchy. nevertheless, a good track. (4/5) <br /> <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - A slower song. not song of my favorites, but the chorus is good and so is the guitar work. (4/5) <br /> <br />5. Disposable Heroes - this song is long but its really awesome. Speeds up from the previous song nothing else i can think of. (5/5) <br /> <br />6. Leper Messiah - This is my second favorite song on the cd. I really love the heavy guitars and the lyrics and the way they are delivered. Cool intro and chorus. \\"time to kiss your life goodbye\\" (5/5) <br /> <br />7. Orion (Instrumental) - I dont really like instrumentals so i cant rate this one. <br /> <br />8. Damage Inc. - Great way to end the album. Heavy thrash and it is really really fast. (5/5) <br /> <br />Best Metallica song is \\"One\\" Too bad its not on this album.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I got a kick out of Sommers's Mummy movies, but heard such bad word of mouth about VAN HELSING that I put off seeing it. Wish I'd have done so indefinitely. The script is an absolute mess, trying to cram in everything but the kitchen sink, and the highly anticipated effects prove to be a total disappointment. If I never again see another flying and shrieking vampire/harpy, or another vampire make its entrance by dropping down from the top of the frame, or another CG werewolf bouncing off CG walls, or another hero or villain swing across wide expanses on ropes, I'll be a happy man. The transformation scenes are cheesy (but with none of the charm of the 40s originals they try to emulate), and the CG creatures too often resemble George Pal Puppetoons in their movement. If there had been a little more emphasis on a logical plot and any character development rather than the overemphasis on FX, maybe they could have spent a little more time modeling and animating the CG correctly. But when you use as much as there is here, there are bound to be shortcuts and sub-par animation. At the very least, I thought this film would be dumb fun, but it disappoints even at that level. You'll find yourself looking at your watch and thinking \\"Hello, I already SAW this -- how much longer?\\" Then you'll take it out and put in one of the great old Universal b/w horror films and have some real fun. Oh, and by the way, the Igor makeup has to win Worst...Movie...Makeup...EVER.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank HIDING FROM THE NAZIS<br /><br />Imagine this...<br /><br />You are a Jew and you just went into hiding from the Nazis. The Nazis find out your location, they come and............. Sorry you will have to read the book to find out the rest of this story.<br /><br />This book is about a girl named Anne Frank.

B0007GAERG|4.0|Isn't it funny how every time Mariah comes out with a new album, she claims she's over her troubled past and that she knows who she is as a person and artist?  She also introduces the album with a song about starting fresh and overcoming obstacles.  Such was her Charmbracelet opener \\"Through The Rain\\" and such is the lead single from The Emancipation of Mimi, \\"It's Like That\\" (at least part of it is, anyway).  Unlike Charmbracelet, which sold considerably better than Glitter but was still considered a flop, Emancipation truly is a fresh start for Carey.  For the first time, she has truly abandoned all limitations and went for the gusto.  The result is a fresh, innovative record that's equal parts soul searching and just plain fun.  For those who like to compare, think a bit of Prince, a bit of Beyonce, and a lot of older soul/R&B artist.  It's a modern and classy sound, and whether it ultimately works or not, it's about time Mariah tried this. <br /> <br />It starts, like all her albums do, with the first single, \\"It's Like That\\", which is a decent club track.  However, once you hear the rest of it you'll see that this song was only meant for marketing purposes only as this is the worst song on the record.  From there, the album truly showcases Mariah's enormous talent.  Her official website hails this as \\"The return of the Voice\\", and they couldn't be more right.  This is the best Mariah's voice has ever been.  Let me say that again.  This is the BEST her voice has EVER been in her 15+ year career.  Check out songs like \\"Mine Again\\" or \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" and you'll see what I mean.   <br /> <br />Also, the collaborations on this album are actually really fun.  The Neptunes-produced \\"Say Somethin\\" with Snoop Dogg gets props. Even if it has no lyrical quality whatsoever it still has a great beat and an addictive hook.  \\"Get Your Number\\" is also a great song, done with Jermaine Dupri which has an almost disco-like, Mirwais-sounding background to it.  I expected more from the Nelly collaboration, \\"To The Floor\\", but it still is a welcome track. <br /> <br />One track that deserves special attention is the second single, \\"We Belong Together\\".  This is by far the best song on this album and probably the best Mariah Carey song I've ever heard.  It's simple-yet-groovy music and Carey's wondrous lyrical flow make this track amazing.  I'm hoping it will become a huge hit and maybe put Mariah back on top where she once ruled.  The afore-mentioned \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" is also worth mentioning.  This should be a single as well. <br /> <br />Overall, this ranks as one of Carey's best records.  Just like Butterfly introduced a new sound for her way back when, Emancipation of Mimi does it yet again now.  It'll be instantly likeable for most people and it's nice and radio-friendly for easy accessibility.  For no other reasons, her amazing voice is worth getting the album for.  That and \\"We Belong Together\\".   <br />
B000002H33|5.0|From the first time I popped this CD into the player, I knew this CD was awesome. The beginning of Battery (the first song) starts off with a slowish, mellow guitar and then it launches you into, well, Metallica. I loved this CD, do love this CD, and probably will always love it. I RECOMMEND IT! Even if you've never heard Metallica before, you should still get it. You won't regret it. <br />Ratings: <br />1 Battery: 9/10 <br />2 Master of Puppets: 10/10 <br />3 The Thing That Should Not Be: 10/10 (GREAT SONG) <br />4 Welcome Home (Sanitarium): 9/10 <br />5 Disposable Heroes: 8/10 (Not my favorite, but still good) <br />6 Leper Messiah: 9/10  <br />7 Orion (Instrumental): 10/10 <br />8 Damage Inc.: 10/10 (Next to #4, it's my favorite)

B00064MW6K|4.0|The film brings to the screen the story of the very well known comic book character.  The movie sheds light on when, how and why, Patience Phillips was transformed into the \\"Catwoman,\\" though for those expecting the setting to be Gotham City they will be a little disappointed.   <br />Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, allowing for an entertaining, action-packed adventure. <br />On the negative side, Benjamin Bratt's character seems to be everywhere at the same time, which is highly unlikely even for a movie based on a comic. <br />Moreover, it does lack that special something to put it over the top, like Spiderman for example.  <br />Aside from that, the concept, the setting, the special effects, the music, and the battle scenes are all pretty good.  Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
B0007O38F8|4.0|if it wasn't for dre's beats this album would be 2 stars but like many of dre's artists the only reason they sell is his dope @$$ beats but if your even a little bit of a fifty fan it's worth it <br />top 3 songs <br />1.Candy Shop <br />2.Gunz Come Out <br />3.Just A lil bit
B00000K19E|5.0|The film brings to the screen the story of Neo, a young man, who finds himself in the middle of a war between humans and machines.  If that wasn't enough, he soon realizes that his whole life has been a dream and a lie.   <br />The Matrix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with significant elements of science fiction.  <br />Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again. <br />Simply put, this movie has made History!  It has revolutionized cinema.  The concept, the setting, the SPECIAL EFFECTS, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  The Matrix is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, The Matrix is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B00062ZE3U|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS <br />=================== <br /> <br />I'll be honest, unlike most fans here, I have a very hard time listening to \\"Mother Earth\\". It's just too opera oriented for my Metal taste. Although Within Temptation is a highly talented group of musicians, and \\"Mother Earth\\" was a ground breaking release, I found it rather boring most of the time. Maybe it's just me....Oh well, on to \\"Silent Force\\"!!! <br /> <br />I simply loved every single minute of \\"Silent Force\\". This is a much more enjoyable listen than \\"Mother Earth\\" in my opinion. Instead of all the high pitched operatic themes, \\"Silent Force\\" has a more straight forward direction, which was a much needed change in my opinion.... <br /> <br />I don't really like to compare bands with this much talent, because they each deserve their own place in the music world, but I can't get over how similar \\"Silent Force\\" is to \\"Fallen\\" from Evanescence. I love the new direction!!!... <br /> <br />The sound, the direction, and the songs all made me feel like I wasn't even listening to Within Temptation at all. It was a wonderful breath of fresh air to these ears after being completely unimpressed with \\"Mother Earth\\"... <br /> <br />I think anyone who hears this can't help but be impressed. Regardless of what the critics say, Within Temptation should explode onto the new Metal scene with \\"Silent Force\\". This release has certainly raised the bar for Within Temptation, and their future is looking very bright... <br /> <br />This is not a sellout release from Within Temptation, this is simply a MASTERPIECE!!!
B000058A1G|5.0|Action, not, \\"The Action\\" were one of the best club bands in the UK in the mid 60's along with Alan Bown. They were one of the first British bands to play Motown. Action shows were always first class and I saw them often working as a DJ at the Blue Moon Club. Reggie King was a first class singer. The band never really made it commercially due to the fact that, like Alan Bown they always sounded better live than on record and also the fact that there records were usually cover versions. Still a great CD to own and it brings back many memories.
0385512058|1.0|Almost against my better judgment I bought this book in electronic form from Amazon.  Do NOT be misled by the five star ratings (written by Ferrazzi pals?).  The book is fluff.  It is all Ferrazzi, all the time.  Frankly despite all his unseemly horn-blowing, I still don't know what he ever accomplished that should impress me.<br /><br />Bottom line: save your cash.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Take one geeky, gawky, nerd.  Add one red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury (what other car has a name as menacing as \\"Fury?\\").  Mix well.  Let the killing begin.<br /><br />The movie feels eerie from the beginning.  We see a Plymouth Fury rolling down the assembly line in 1957.  Soon something interesting happens that lets you know that there is something special about this car.  Well, special in the Twilight Zone sort of way.  We follow the history of the car in a somewhat abbreviated way, to the point where the car ends up in the hands of Arnie Cunningham.<br /><br />Keith Gordon plays Arnie Cunningham.  Arnie is the kid (kind of like me) that is never cool and often seems to be the one targeted by bullies.  There is something about the beat up red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury that speaks to Arnie.<br /><br />Arnie does have a good friend, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell).  Dennis is much of what Arnie is not.  He has a cool car and is the star of the high school football team.  However, Arnie's friendship with Dennis does not protect Arnie from high school bully Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) and his cronies.<br /><br />What happens next is somewhat predictable, but not everything is predictable, unless you know the story.  Arnie names the car Christine and begins working on it.  However, it is soon evident that Christine has the ability to take care of herself, if she has the right human to help her.  As Christine rejuvenates herself, she infuses Arnie with characteristics that may mirror Christine.  One of those characteristics is hatred for those who would disrespect, either Christine or Arnie.  Those who disrespect Christine or Arnie, most especially Christine, are dealt with harshly.  We eventually find out that Christine is a harsh mistress if her partner \\"cheats\\" on her.<br /><br />There are some very good scenes in this movie.  The whole scene at the gas station was gruesome and good at the same time.  Christine rolling down the highway in flames is a very unique scene.  There are even a couple of scary scenes.  However, the movie in general is not scary so much as it is disturbing in a creepy crawly sort of way.  Those viewers who tend to think too much about a movie could be analyzing this one well into the night, listening for the roar of a Plymouth Fury.s is a very unique scene.

B0007GAERG|4.0|Somewhere in between the release of 2001's Glitter album and movie, and the weeks before the release of this disc, many people speculated that Mariah had practically fallen off the map and couldn't come back hard like she's \\"supposed to\\".  That's sad, for Glitter the movie and soundtrack were both pretty good, and 2002's Charmbracelet was pretty good, although all were poorly received (unfortunately).  But, with this disc, Mariah can definitely return to the top of the game where she belongs.<br /><br />This album succeeds simply because Mariah takes it back to where it all began; her voice.  She's not trying too hard to captivate her hip-hop audience, but she's also not alienating them.  Even the club jams that have guests are something to be listened to.  Check out \\"Say Somethin'\\", featuring Snoop Dogg.  The lyricims in this song and Snoop's bars are definitely something to check out.  The whole vibe of the song is postively positive.  \\"One and Only\\" featuring Twista, definitely ups the ante on this album.  You can tell that Mariah is influenced by hip-hop, given her Twista-like delivery on her verses.  And Twista never disappoints, as he comes hard in the limited space he is given to do so.  But, she doesn't always need guests to get the floor jumping - check out the infectious first single \\"It's Like That\\", which has the right chorus and catchiness to get you moving!<br /><br />What makes this disc work is Mariah's voice, which is practically unparalleled.  Just check out \\"Mine Again\\", which is quite possibly the best song on the album vocally.  Mariah really shines on this song, and lets loose.  \\"We Belong Together\\" is very good, with its slick song references in the lyrics, and Mariah delivers perfectly.  Also worth mentioning are \\"Circles\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\", in which Mariah really lets herself go and lets you know she cannot be touched by many vocally.  The closing song, \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", is a perfect way to end the album, and Mariah once again shows you why she's worthy of the title \\"diva\\".  She really lets go on this song.<br /><br />There are a couple of low points on this album.  Although I love Mariah's voice and she sounds practically at her best, sometimes you get the feeling that she's screaming to hit her notes properly.  It starts on \\"Mine Again\\" and then it's present on the rest of the album.  Also, is Mariah and her label sure that \\"Get Your Number\\" didn't feature Nelly along with \\"To the Floor\\"?  Both sound just like Nelly to me, and neither really work for me at all.<br /><br />Thankfully, Mariah can stand tall now that this album has been released.  I am sure she's confident in her ability and now the critics and stand aside...Mariah is back!  This album is reminiscent of Butterfly, Rainbow, and Glitter, Mariah's better albums.  With albums like this and a voice like this that showcases said voice, how can you go wrong?  Simply put, you can't.y she's worthy of the title \\"diva\\".

B0002S947K|5.0|Every song on this CD is beautiful, Lamontagne pulls you into his world. This CD sounds like it should be pulled from the mellow back tracks of 60s and 70s singers. It's like Damien Rice with a less contemporary musical feel, more bluesy and less unsure. Highly recommend this CD, one you play it you will not want to listen to anything else for months.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I admit Mariah doesn't have the voice she used to but however, she doesn't sound like a \\"dog whistling or an alley cat\\". Mariah's voice is too powerful for it to just drop down that low so stop hating, and as far as Britney being Aretha.....HAHAHA you crack me up. This album delivers a little something for everybody from the club joint \\"It's Like That\\", to the R&B/Gospel ballad \\"Mine Again\\". Not to mention \\"Circles\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\", and \\"We Belon Together\\", on those tracks Mariah sounds just as good as she used to. I'd say the only song that i don't too much care for is \\"Joy Ride\\". Mariah is on top of her game, the only thing she needs to prove that is album sales so i guarentee you wouldn't be disappointed if you buy the album.
B00003CXTG|1.0|ARGH!!!! I hated this movie! <br /> <br />Like many who have come before, I have long-since considered the 1978-miniseries \\"Pearl\\" to forever represent the perpetual rock bottom in the history of Pearl Harbor-related cinema.  Alas, the events of May 21, 2001 have proven me dead wrong. <br /> <br />As a 1920's flit of childhood mischief depicts two Tennessee farm boys in the process of taking daddy's crop duster up for an unauthorized spin, the premonitions of what follows become readily apparent, as we flash-forward 20 years as the dreaded war-clouds are  steadily gathering with frightening ferocity. <br /> <br />Needless to say, the heroics that follow engender a generous contortion of the trademark rule that \\"in the movies, anything can happen.\\"  Therefore, just as surely as an army of spear-equipped, undersized teddy bears can overpower the Imperial Storm Troopers, a duet of farm-bred white trash can easily outfly the most proficient ranks in the Luftwaffe and Imperial Japanese Navy.  However, this does by no means render the cheesy assortment of macho heroism any more forgivable, nor the sheer essence of redneckiness that pervades every inch of our two protagonists(Hartnett and Affleck) any less repulsive. <br /> <br />Sweat-doused and greasy, these two inert specimens of farm-raised white bread seem fresh from an overnight excursion at the local outhouse, not to mention a good year or two removed from their latest shower.  Needless to say, Hartnett and Affleck are a little too cut-out for their hillbilliesque alter egos for their own good, as the two compliment every inch of their sleazy mannerisms with thick, ugly southern drawls.   <br /> <br />While, realistically, it's plain to see that these two lame-brained home fries wouldn't last two seconds in the Air Corps' flight training program, the film attempts to suspend enough disbelief with which to neatly deposit our all-American heroes among the ranks of newly-commission fighter pilots in the USAAF.  Given that the year is 1940, worldwide tension still prevails and a pervading sense of conscience will lead many to heed calls of duty overseas.  <br /> <br />Thus, Affleck becomes the next \\"Yank in the RAF\\", honing his skills in the Battle of Britain until a wily Messerchmitt pilot perforates his Spitfire into a metallic mass of swiss cheese, thereafter committing him to an untimely plunge into the English Channel and a misdiagnosed \\"KIA\\"-status to boot.   <br />  <br />Predictably, Hartnett's efforts to console the bereaved girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale) quickly trancend into an untimely romance, further complicated by the Honolulu-based arrival of Affleck, who's none too enthused as to the aftermath of the year-long chain-of-events that have transpired since his own disappearance. <br /> <br />As surely as \\"boys will be boys\\"(particularly the uneducated redneck variety), the increasingly-bitter verbal confrontation quickly escalates into an all-out free-for-all, whereby the faces of these all-American heroes incur a long-overdue decoration of scars and abrasions.  Fortunately, the date just so happens to be December 6, 1941.  Thus, we can rest assured that the events of the following morning will inevitably infuse our heroes with the necessary resolve with which to put their differences aside and make the meatballs pay for their dastardly deeds.  <br /> <br />Call me on my propensity for nitpicking, but the sheer number of technical inaccuracies in this flick drove me absolutely out of my mind, being the World War II-buff that I am.   <br /> <br />For instance, consider a scene in which Affleck instructs his fellow aviators into the futility of attempting to \\"outrun Zeros\\". <br />  <br />1)  Given that the performance virtues of the Misubishi A6M catered to the category of maneuverability rather than speed, the proper terminology in this case would necessitate replacement of the word  \\"outrun\\" with \\"outturn\\", and... <br />  <br />2) Considering that U.S. Forces had yet toconfront the Zero in combat, how the hell would this inept redneck have any familiarity with its flight characteristics?  <br /> <br />Technical shortcomings aside, the filmmakers themselves are no more proficient at tackling the political spectrum, as indicated by a watered-down assessment of the Japanese motivations for attacking Pearl Harbor.  According to the movie, the attack in question amounted to nothing more than bitter retribution for America's \\"unjust\\" material embargo as imposed at the former half of 1941.  Thus, the incentive of the filmmakers to omit any and all references to the Japanese Army's brutal rampage throughout China or the oppression of the Korean people appears to amount to nothing more than lame-brained attempts to appease  <br />Japan's recently-revived nationalistic sentiments. <br /> <br />Before long, it becomes readily apparent that Bay and Bruckheimer's primary source of information on World War II happens to have been derived from too many hours on the Playstation.  Battle scenes are staged with thick layers of pyrotechnics but little insight into the realities of warfare, while the dogfights themselves incorporate little more than a repetitious series of horizontal scissors, culminating in an eventual spewing of smoke and earthward plunge as an aircraft is finally hit. <br /> <br />But, enough of that.  Back to the \\"story\\". <br /> <br />As coincidence would have it, the personal relationship of our white-bread duo with Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) have enabled a sufficient succession of pulled-strings with which to allow Hartnett and Affleck to take part in the Tokyo raid of April 18, 1942.  Predictably, only one of our boys is destined to survive this attack, thereby instigating a prompt and fitting resolution to the ongoing love triangle, once and for all. <br /> <br />As a hero's welcome pays tribute to the Doolittle Raiders, a voiceover from Beckinsale recounts that after the raid in question, \\"America would know nothing butvictory.\\"  As much as I hate to divert the attention of the filmmakers from a pretentious moment of self-styled reflection, I will be so bold to point out that Corregidor wasn't captured until May 6, a good three weeks after the Tokyo raid.   <br /> <br />But, even if the above assertion was accurate, who really cares? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002ZMITY|1.0|If you are a true appreciator of Da Ali G Show, you should not waste your time on this movie.  I watched it with someone who has never seen the show, thinking it was going to be a great intro;  I was really embarrassed because it was so bad.  I felt compelled to write a review, since for some reason some people are recommending this movie.  I actually like stupid humor like Dumb and Dumber, but the humor in this movie is just too stupid and juvenile.  It lacks all of the cleverness of the show.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Well, I don't really have much to say about this CD....<br /><br />I just recently heard of the band, and purchased their newer CD, Reckoning Night....It was amazing....Fast and Powerful Melodic Speed Metal....<br /><br />So, I went ahead and bought this CD too, it is even more amazing than the newer one....and this was their debut album which makes it even more amazing!....Everything is very fast and powerful like Reckoning Night, but they change up the pace so much in this, yet everything seems to be flow nicely and is played quite flawlessly....<br /><br />This is the best CD I have ever heard!

Smart bombs? Our exploration of space made us proud to be Americans, but I am not proud that technology has been abused  to shock and awe the world. We are now feared, but we used to be loved and admired. By the way, I agree that Johnny Depp's good ole boy is right on. He's from Kentucky. Outstanding acting by all.

0393317552|5.0|_Guns, Germs, and Steel_ by Jared Diamond is one of the most informative, epic, well-written, and fascinating \\"macrohistory\\" books I have ever read. In this book, Diamond discussed the rise of complex human societies in the last 13,000 years, seeking to answer one fundamental question; why did some civilizations come to dominate others? Why did the Fertile Crescent and China for instance develop advanced societies with, as the title suggests, guns, germs, and steel, while other areas of the world, such as Polynesia, Australia, and the Americas, did not? Or in those cases where some civilizations were beginning to acquire such things, why did they get off to such a late start? Why did the Spanish conquer the Incans instead of vice versa? <br /> <br />In a nutshell, he concluded that societies developed differently on different continents not because of racial differences in attitudes or intelligence, but because of differences in continental environments. Advanced technology, centralized political organizations, writing, and professional armies (or simply put the military advantage of simply having large numbers of people), etc. could only emerge in dense, sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, domesticable wild plant and animal species needed for agriculture to arise were very unevenly distributed around the world, with the most valuable species concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe (Southwest Asia, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and the adjacent Amazon basin, the eastern U.S., Africa's Sahel, West Africa, Ethiopia, and New Guinea), all of which became the earliest homelands of agriculture and thus regions that got a head start on developing guns, germs, and steel.  <br /> <br />Animals were vital to a society as a source of meat, milk products, fertilizer, transportation, leather, for military use, plow traction, and wool and those areas that lacked suitable animals to domesticate suffered accordinglyin terms of societal development. The Late Pleistocene extinctions of large mammals in the Americas and Australia deprived humanity in those areas of potentially very valuable domesticable species. Of the big (over 100 pound) herbivores and omnivores, 148 potential candidates for domestication, they are mostly located in Eurasia (72 candidate species, versus 51 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 24 in the Americas, and 1 in Australia). Further, out of those candidates, only 14 were actually domesticated, 13 of them in Eurasia; what he called the \\"Major Five\\" - sheep, the goat, cow, pig, and horse, and the \\"Minor Nine\\" - the Arabian camel, Bactrian camel, donkey, reindeer, water buffalo, yak, Bali cattle, mithan (wild ancestor the gaur, found primarily in India and Burma), and the one American one, the llama and alpaca (two well-differentiated breeds of the same species). The other 134 potential candidates were eliminated due to problems with diet, growth rate, problems of captive breeding, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, and/or social structure, any one problem enough to preclude domestication even in modern times. Of further interest, Southwest Asia had seven of the wild ancestors naturally occurring, a huge advantage.  <br /> <br />In the world of plants there were similar disparities in distribution; of the 56 species of grass with the heaviest seeds, at least 10 times heavier than median species, Eurasia's Mediterranean zone had 32 of them, with barley and emmer wheat 3rd and 13th respectively in seed size. In contrast, of the 56 species, only 6 were found in East Asia, 4 in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11 in the Americas, and 2 in Australia.  <br /> <br />Another set of differences lead to a variation in societal evolution in the case of plant and animal domestications as well as in technological innovations and political institutions, as most societies acquire much more from other societies than they invent themselves (his discussion on the evolution of writing and in particular the alphabet in this regard was fascinating). Diffusion and migration within and between continents played a very important role in the development of a society, and in some continents diffusion and migration was considerably easier, most rapid in Eurasia because of its east-west major axis and its relatively modest ecological and geographical barriers. As crops and animals depended strongly on climate and hence on latitude, huge areas ranging almost from the Atlantic to the Pacific were open to the movement of domesticated plants and animals. Diffusion was slower in Africa and especially in the Americas due to those continents north-south major axes (traveling just a few hundred or a thousand miles north or south can render a society's crops and animals completely unsuitable for use) and much more pronounced geographic and ecological barriers (such as the Sahara Desert in Africa). Similarly, diffusion in the last 6,000 years has been easiest from Eurasia to sub-Saharan Africa, while long completely absent between Eurasia and the Americas (isolated at low latitudes by broad oceans and at high latitudes by geography and by a climate suitable just for hunter-gatherers).  <br /> <br />The last set of major factors he analyzed related to continental differences in area or total population size. A larger area or population meant more inventors, more competing societies, more innovations that exist to be adopted, and more pressure to adopt and retain those innovations, as those societies that fail to do so tend to be eliminated or absorbed by competing societies. Among the world's landmasses, area and the number of competing societies were greatest for Eurasia, while considerably smaller for Australia for instance. The Americas, despite their rather large total land area, were in effect fragmented by ecology and geography into a series of poorly connected smaller continents.  <br /> <br />Relating to both population size and the \\"Eurasians' long intimacy with domestic animals\\" was the development of germs. Crowd diseases could not sustain themselves in small bands of hunter-gatherers or slash-and-burn farmers, nor perhaps would they develop at all, as only human association with cattle gave us for instance measles (evolved from rinderpest) and smallpox (evolved from cowpox).  <br /> <br />Obviously I have just scratched the surface in my review. This is an excellent book that ties together findings in history, archaeology, paleontology, epidemiology, and linguistics in an extremely readable and informative format.  <br />
B0001L3LUE|4.0|It's obvious that Robert S. McNamara has a hard time with these interviews. Struggling at times, seeking explanations for LeMays bombings on Japan and for the escalation in Vietnam, occasionally looking like a nervous wreck. Tears in his eyes.  <br /> <br />McNamara, once described by Barry Goldwater as an \\"IBM machine with legs\\" has an opportunity here in 'Fog of War' to present his case to the public, and he does so with both integrity and honesty. From his early childhood he remembers the victory parade when the First War ended, how he fought to be the most ambitious and brightest student in school, the experiences he had during World War II and how he was offered the top spot at Ford company. JFK offering secretary of defense. Then there is the Cuban Missile crisis 1962. Those fateful 13 days when the world came inches away from nuclear war. Then of course the escalation of the Vietnam War during LBJ...  <br /> <br />Those are the subjects and 'Fog of War' goes through it very skillfully. Presenting eleven lessons in the film. What were our successes? Our failures? What is in a sense human nature when faced with political turmoil and crisis on the brink of war, and indeed in times of war. What are we capable of if we examine ourselves?  <br /> <br />These lessons are experiences by a man making decisions and giving advice to Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Simultaneously it casts a shadow on current events in the sense that it can't help but to raise important questions of war and peace today. Questions about US foreign policy in general.  That is reason enough to take the time it takes to watch `Fog of War'. It's interesting and thought provoking.  <br />

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I was minding my business scrolling through the reviews of this magnum opus of an album when I came across some idiotic responses like \\"omfg this isn't real punk, so therefore it sucks\\" \\"NOT REAL PUNK MALLCORE\\" etc. Hahahahahaha! You know what I really hate more than \\"punks\\" themselves? Punks with nasty attitudes. But, the whole punk ideology is based on having a nasty attitude, so that is pretty much all of them. People, wake up to yourselves. We all know, that punk is music that is about attitude and image, not music. Think the Sex Pistols would of got anywhere if they hadn't said the \\"f\\" word every fifteen seconds and claimed to be a \\"violent alternative\\" in music? Nope. They pretty much were talentless chimpanzees pandering around a recording studio picking lice out of each other's spiked hair. People say that teen-pop, dance-pop, Britney Spears etc is music that sells because of Image, not because of actual music-- most bands people would consider \\"real punk\\" do exactly the same thing. Except looking pretty and innocent, they are menacing and aggressive.. It's all image! It doesn't matter WHAT kind of image it is, it's IMAGE nonetheless. Look, I'm not dissing all punk at all.. because there are dozens of diamonds in the rough \\"punk\\" bands that rock.. I'm really just lashing out at the irritating fanbase who think they're being completely non-conformist and hip by listening to bands that sell aggressive attitude images instead of clean-cut, bubblegum. \\"The Clash\\" is one punk band that is TALENTED beyond compare. These guys ROCK people. They aren't about selling their image to anyone-- take a look at these dudes people, their hair hasnt been spiked to five feet high and they don't go around spray-painting public property to sell records.. they are about substance, not style.. but they have a whole lot of style as well :) <br /> <br />I love the off-key wailing of Joe Strummer. I love the sharp energetic riffs of Mick Jones, I love their very very talented song-writing and their ability to delge into many different musical genres other than punk-- this however in the idiot dittohead fanbase of the punks is a no-no.. if you don't stay faithful to your musical roots, YOU SOLD OUT. SELLOUTS! WHO CARES IF THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, AND ARE ACTUALLY BEING INNOVATIVE AND NOT PLAYING THE SAME EXACT CARBON COPY OF THE SAME SONG OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ALBUM AFTER ALBUM! SELLOUTS!! BOO! The Clash have the talent to do it all, and they don't CARE who they're pissing off when they do it. Check out the styles on this album.. there's some laid back jazz here, some rockabilly there, some reggae there and some ska here.. just some good old fashioned pop, new-wave.. you name it, the Clash have nailed it and done it without imitating any other band. Lyrically, they are supurb, they have a crack at the idiotic punk-fan base any time they can, they flaunt their leftist politics and just.. good 'ol rock n roll roots.. Elvis would dig this album had he been alive to hear it.. \\"The Clash\\" are punk, fueled by PURE substance.. and I'm sure their stage show would of been a blast as well, had I been alive at the time to see them.  <br /> <br />The sound is so diverse on this album.. you've got apocalyptic punk on the title track, with one of the most memorable driving backbeats in any song ever... rampaging rambunctious ska and 50s rockabilly- \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\", ambitious and successful experimentation- \\"The Card Cheat\\", ultra-catchy and super fun pop- \\"Lover's Rock\\", nutty jazz-- \\"Jimmy Jazz\\"-- oh my! London Calling is one of the sexiest albums of all time.. purely timeless. What the hell IS real punk anyway? Music that favors style over substance? If that is truely the case, then this is about as Punk as a Carpenters record. :) Music that never changes  or else it might \\"sell out their fans\\" ? Guilty as charged then! But noone here has actually the ability to explain why these things are BAD to begin with. <br /> <br />Get that cheese grater going men. Slap on this album and ROCK the *BEEP* OUT.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Listen up folks, this is no mediocre comeback. Mariah came back roaring like a lion. This is her most promising collection in years. From the moment that you hear Carey's voice on the first track, you know she's not playing around. Then the album moves to the very powerful and heartfelt \\"We Belong Together.\\" Her voice is practically flawless here. One of the highlights is the Kanye West produced \\"Stay The Night.\\" Kanye delivers on the beats and they're a great compliment to her voice. My favorite rap colabo is \\"One And Only\\" with Twista. This is probably one of the better rap/sung collaborations in years. Twista's rap is really sharp and on target. Another classic is \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\" This one is stunning. Mariah has done everything right on this album and the producers and guests have come up big also. I don't see how anyone could possibly question the condition of her voice after hearing this record. This album is vicious. She's setting the bar really high. Mariah's not giving an inch away. That's how you're supposed to do it. Watch out. She's on the verge of putting the industry on lock again. Everyone will be talking about this CD. Better hurry up and get it.
B000002H97|2.0|First off, I can't call them Metallica anymore because they are no longer Metal. So I made a name up and came up with Lica becuase the metal was not with them on this album and every album released after this one.  <br /> <br />This is an average album. I noticed on a lot of the reviews, they're are a lot of people that are stating that this was the album that got them into Lica and that this is the best thing from Lica that they've ever heard. I also seen someone go as far as stating that this was the best album that Lica has and that people can't stand seeing a band evolve. Apparently, they are not true Lica fans. In fact, Lica didn't evolve at all. If you were a true Lica fan, you would know that this was the downfall of their heavy metal reign. Although they became the biggest metal band in the world with the help of this album, they still lost the respect from some of the true metal heads that helped launch their career. Yeah, there are some good songs on here, but even the heaviest song on this album couldn't be compared to the weakest song on any of their previous albums. There are no more hard gallops on the guitar, no more outstanding bass riffs, no more double bass, no more crazy type solos and definitely no more lyrics that actually mean something. Some people say, \\"Oh, Lica has been here for so long. They can't play metal forever.\\" I thought that was a good point, but I was very wrong. Bands like Slayer are still around banging their friggin' heads and they've been around just as long as Lica. When new fans say that the change was good, what would become of the fans that stuck with Lica through their struggling times? We get left in the dirt with this so-called metal. After this album, they not only sold out to their own true metal roots, but they also sold out to the true fans that were behind them in the beginning. On the previous albums, they kept the metal sound with sometimes slow paced mellow songs, but still kept it true to everyone purchasing their music. This is the sell out album that created new fans and made them one of the most popular metal bands, but it was also the album that \\"Blackened\\" their future in metal. Soooo, if you're like me and wonder why Lars Ulrich was crying and protesting against file sharing, listen to this and you will know why. Simply, it was because no one would buy the music that they released from this album and every album after. I wouldn't recommend this album, but I would highly recommend having someone burn it for you. New fans of Lica, if you want to listen to something melodic, listen to some of their previous stuff like \\"Fade To Black\\" or \\"To Live Is To Die\\". Songs like these are mellow and melodic, but still have the true metal sound to it. <br /> <br />PEACE!    <br />
B000002GQE|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, the \\"real\\" Moody Blues started with this album when Justin Hayward and John Lodge joined the band.  \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was the first of a string of seven magnificent albums, all of which I believe stand the test of time.  After these first seven, well that's another story.    \\"Days of Future Passed\\" is probably the Moodies most influential and celebrated album, in that it was one of the first \\"concept\\" or \\"theme\\" albums, which was also the very first one (as far as I know) to fuse classical music with rock and roll.  Here, of course the band recorded with the often unfairly maligned London Symphony Orchestra (see e.g. \\"This is Spinal Tap\\").  However, even though the album sounds a bit dated (as does \\"Sergeant Pepper,\\" written the same year) I still think it works very well.    As the band would become known for, the harmonies in \\"Days\\" are soaring and unique, and the lyrics, for the most part, are well written.  Each of the Moodies contributes significant portions to \\"Days,\\" but, of course, as with most of their albums, Hayward's songs, \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin,\\" are the best, and perhaps two of the top five songs the band ever recorded.  Other standouts are Lodge's \\"Peak Hour,\\" and Thomas' \\"Twilight Time,\\" but its really all very good.  The instrumental portions, rather than serving as just filler, provide the listener with the mood of that part of the day that is being portrayed (i.e. the kinetic segment before \\"Peak Hour\\" and Edge's closing poem \\"Late Lament\\").      There is no question but that this album influenced such great bands as King Crimson, ELP and Yes.  Of course, it also led to alot of shlock, but that is hardly the band's fault.

B0000028MA|5.0|1992, what a year. The early `90s was an exciting time in rock. Now I'll admit to having a soft-spot for hair-metal, but the late 80s, early 90s was getting pretty lame, i.e. \\"Cherry Pie.\\" Although there were some good bands in the days before Nirvana (some genuinely good, some guilty pleasures) the alternative/grunge movement of the early 90s was a refreshing change.<br /><br />The soundtrack to the romantic comedy \\"Singles\\" is the perfect soundtrack and snapshot of that era. With the exception of Nirvana, almost every major Seattle/grunge band from the early 90s is represented, as well as some other alternative artists from that era.<br /><br />Even if you own the complete works of the bands on this disc, this album is still worth buying because many of these songs are not on studio albums or on compilations.<br /><br />You know how it is sometimes when a band puts a song on a soundtrack...the song often sounds like filler or a b-side that wasn't good enough to put on a proper studio album. Not so with the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack.

Pearl Jam contributes two songs to this album, the mid-tempo \\"Breath\\" and the harder-rocking \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" They sound most similar to \\"Vs.\\" era PJ. These songs remain two of the finest, if not finest, songs that Pearl Jam has ever recorded.  Chris Cornel (Soundgarden/Audioslave) contributes the soulful contemplative \\"Seasons.\\" Paul Westerberg (Replacements, solo artist) contributions include the incredibly catchy \\"Dyslexic Heart\\" and \\"Waiting for Somebody.\\" These are also easily two of the best songs Westerberg has recorded. The Lovemongers (aka Heart) contribute a cool rendition of Led Zeppelin's \\"Battle of Evermore.\\" Mother Love Bone (the prelude to Pearl Jam) includes their morose classic \\"Crown of Thorns.\\" Soundgarden's hard hitting \\"Birth Ritual\\" sounds as though it could have easily have been included on their \\"Badmoterfinger\\" (1991) album, and it is easily just as good as any other song from that album. The underappreciated Mudhoney include their fuzzy grunge classic \\"Overblown.\\" The CD goes back in time a bit for Jimi Hendrix's classic \\"May This Be Love.\\" The inclusion of a classic rock song on a grunge album does not break the pace as its tone/style compliments the other songs nicely. The Screaming Trees awesome \\"Nearly Lost You\\" (from the \\"Sweet Oblivion\\" album) and Chicago's Smashing Pumpkins \\"Drown\\" round-up the CD. Again, those are two of the best songs that either band has recorded.<br /><br />Every song on this soundtrack is excellent. There is simply no filler.

B000003BQW|3.0|This was the first Ramones album released after they left Sire Records, and also the first studio album recorded after Dee Dee quit the band.  It's not a classic Ramones album by any means, but it does have it's moments.  Even without Dee Dee in the band, he still contributed the best songs on the album; \\"Poison Heart\\", \\"Strength to Endure\\" and \\"Main Man\\".  Joey wrote seven songs for the album, most of which are decent, but none of them are all that memorable.  Marky Ramone also contributed his first two songs to this album, which are okay.  There is one cover song on the album, which is the Doors' \\"Take It As It Comes\\", and it's actually one of the better songs on the album.  While this isn't one of the Ramones' best albums, Ramones fans should enjoy it.
B000002INR|4.0|Skid Row was one of the best bands of the pre-alternative \\"hair-band\\" era. It's unfortunate that Skid Row has been lumped in with bands like Warrant and Poison, because Skid Row rocked a lot harder than those bands. I would go as far as to say that Skid Row were second only to Guns N' Roses as the best mainstream rock band of the late 80s, early 90s. Skid Row has always had a knack for writing heavy, catchy, infectious riffs with good sing-along choruses. Sebastian Bach was, in my opinion, second only to Axl Rose as the best singer/frontman of the late 80s/early 90s.<br /><br />Although Skid Row's debut is their best selling album, it's not their best work. It pales in comparison to their masterpiece \\"Slave to the Grind\\" (1991) and the underrated \\"Subhuman Race\\" (1995). Although it's still better than the Bach-less \\"Thickskin\\" (2003).<br /><br />Skid Row's debut is slightly generic, although it's still a strong album. The highlights include the ballads \\"18 and Life,\\" \\"I Remember You,\\" and the anthem \\"Youth Gone Wild.\\" The rest of the album is by-the-numbers standard 80s metal. But they're still all good songs.<br /><br />If you want to check out Skid Row, I recommend the follow-up album \\"Slave to the Grind.\\" But Skid Row's debut is still a good CD. If you are looking for a good 80s metal record, this album should please you.
B00020X88O|5.0|I know, I know..5 stars!! But anyone going into Showgirls expecting something on the level of Hamlet will certainly be disappointed...frankly, I found this film sheer trash heaven! Yes, its incredulous, flimsily plotted, broadly acted...but its non stop fun from beginning to end too, and really, isn't that what we want fom the movies? Elizabeth Berkley was unfairly and unjustly maligned for her potrayal of short-tempered starlet Nomi Malone; truthfully she has energy, fire and moxie, and she keeps your attention going in a solid performance. The real star here though is Gina Gershon, who smolders in the role of Crystle Conners, the star of Goddess. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, capturing the colorful essence of Vegas, and the staging of the shows seems truthful. Yes, it basically becomes a trashy backstage drama ala \\"All About Eve\\" but you probably won't see a movie this entertaining from a major studio in quite some time. \\"Showgirls\\" is a trash classic that warrants repeated viewings (and I love the reviewers who rant how \\"awful\\" this film is yet have seen it numerous times...sounds like a contradiction to me). Note: the VIP edition is recommended for die-hard \\"Showgirls\\" fans (and yes we are out there, apparently there are legions of us based on all the reviews for this film). Mainly, the DVD features hilarious commentary that is alterantely amusing and mocking; and a nice \\"Showgirls Diary\\" feature. Sadly, there is no deleted scenes or extended footage, and the other contents include drinking glasses, party games, playing cards, and others items more suitable if one is drunk. Still, it's nicely packaged and looks great in one's DVD collection. <br />   <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Oh yes I been waiting for someone of my time of music loving to make a come back.  One that will let you know she is still here.  Mariah has done it, she has proven that she is what real music is all about.  Can you deny her voice?  Who in mainstream music right now thats hot, compares to Mariah?  This CD is nice way better then the previous album.  If you are looking to hear from the old Mariah there are a couple of ballads, as well as up tempo songs that get real on you.  I like this CD it is hot an most of my friends like it to.  Actually no one I know has said they dont like it.  COP THIS ONE
B000002NAK|5.0|I heard the soundtrack before actually seeing the movie, and I was mesmerized in both experiences. Madonna was made for playing Eva Peron, and singing \\"Dont Cry For Me Argentina\\"... I remember \\"You Must Love Me\\" released as a single. You cannot get sick of that song, no matter anytime you hear it, and to this day I am still amazed at the Drama in that song.<br /><br />The movie is a bit long, ill admit, but everything is beautifully captured. Im watching it again this weekend!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|The buzz created when the title of this album leaked, was iffy at best.  The Press in general has trashed Carey religiously since her troubled summer of 2001. <br />That aside, those who are skeptical of her newest release, \\"the Emancipation of Mimi\\", would be well-served to at least give this disc a once-through (as opposed to a 'once-over'...), and see whether or not they could sit still during the playback. <br /> <br />From Stripped-Down 'Mid-Seventies' R&B Soul grooves on \\"Circles\\", to the Gospel slow-jams of \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (the latter of which closes the disc), there are no two songs the same on this release. <br /> <br />From The \\"Let's Party\\" grooves of \\"It's Like That\\" to the heartbreak of \\"Shake You Off\\", the record is solidly put together.  From the guest appearances by Jermaine Dupri, to Snoop Dogg (I was very impressed with this one!), to the sampled sermon (Pastor Keaton; True Worship Church, Brooklyn), there isn't a track that doesn't deserve some attention. <br /> <br />My absolute favorite?  \\"Fly Like a Bird\\"  (The Bridge of which contains; \\"Keep your Head to the Sky/With God's love you'll survive\\").   The project opens with a slammin'...party groove and closes with a song of encouragement...and inspiration. <br /> <br />With estimates of first-week sales at 300,000 units, Mariah Carey is definitely and once again, at the top of her game.  Vocal Clarity not seen since \\"Butterfly\\" and the raw emotion of her debut (\\"Mariah Carey\\"), this one's a winner from start to finish. <br /> <br />
B00005NNMJ|4.0|Accept's fifth album Balls to the Wall is their most well-known album due to the popular title track whose music video played often on MTV in 1984; a time when MTV actually played music videos.  While the title track is classic and there is a lot of other excellent metal power tracks on this album, I believe that their previous 1983 release, Restless and Wild, is Accept's best.  Still, Balls is a solid 4 -star album.  It is, lyrically, a harsher, more sexually-charged album than any of Accept's other releases.  It is also perhaps their most controversial release with sexually ambiguous numbers likes \\"London Leatherboys\\" and, especially, \\"Love Child.\\"    Germany's answer to Judas Priest begins this album with their most famous and one of their best tracks.  \\"Balls to the Wall\\" kicks well what the title suggests or, in my case, something else entirely (I'm a metal chick).  While I favor \\"Restless and Wild\\" as their best track, \\"Balls\\" is incredibly intense.  \\"London Leatherboys\\"  got some attention back in the day, especially coupled with the cover artwork and the band photo on the inner sleeve (in vinyl terms).  The cover, of course, has a seductive (well, it depends on what you're into) look at a leather-clad man's hairy leg.  The inner sleeve shows Udo in his customary military garb surrounded by his shirtless bandmates (I don't think very many people in the world wanted to see a shirtless Udo). Guitarist Wolf Hoffmann and drummer Stefan Kaufmann even have their arms linked.  I'm not speculating on anything here, but hearing the German metal demons chanting \\"London Leatherboys\\" is a bit unnerving.  Still, the song, musically, is good.  Moving on, the rest of the tracks on side one are amazing.  \\"Fight It Back\\" is a killer, blood-rushing track and, in this case, the lyrics enhance rather than distract: \\"Always been the prophets who make the world evolve.  Always been the average breaking it down.\\"  \\"Head Over Heels\\" is a catchy song.  The music doesn't follow the lyrics which are very sexually-driven about a man needing to peep at a couple getting hot and heavy in a dark alley.  \\"Losing More Than You Ever Had\\" is a slower, more accessible track.    Unlike Restless and Wild, which is solid from first track to last, the first half of Balls is much better than the second.  \\"Love Child\\" probably has the most peculiar lyrics: \\"Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by\\" and more directly \\"Don't know what I am a woman or a man.\\"  \\"Turn Me On\\" is just a straight up, raw shot to the groin (\\"I can't wait to get you down on the dirty floor\\").  \\"Losers and Winners\\" is another odd track.  It is very harsh lyrically.  It is about a man pining after a woman.  Udo advises him to write her a letter expressing his feelings.  It is a little comical hearing the German metal gods chanting \\"Write a letter!\\"  Then the tables are turned: \\"You should give me the letter I'll use it for my own (haha)\\" and later \\"Why don't you take it easy and sc**w the girl who's next to you.\\"  Wow, rough stuff.  While the music takes center stage on side one, the lyrics seem to overpower the music for most of the songs on side two.  It ends with two interesting tracks, although they are not as memorable as the two epic tracks on Restless (\\"Neon Nights\\" and \\"Princess of the Dawn\\").  \\"Guardian of the Night\\" offers a beautiful guitar intro and is nice, especially the melody at the line \\"Can't you hear it always trembling in my voice.\\"  \\"Winterdreams\\" also has a nice guitar intro and offers a pleasant, calming mood.  It is a slow track but with a more uplifting sound than other slow Accept numbers that are almost always dark.  It is a nice way to end the metal brutality of Balls to the Wall.  While many probably consider this the \\"must have\\" Accept record, I think that Restless and Wild is.  Still, all fans of 1980s metal need Balls to the Wall, it is a solid #2 in the Accept discography.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I've been waiting for Mariah to do another \\"Daydream\\" for a long time now or even a \\"Rainbow\\" but TEOM is not eithier of those. I love the album but it's a different Mariah: It's good and MC is on her way to finding a middle ground between R&B and Adult Contemporary. <br /> <br />\\"It's Like That\\" (9/10): It never gets old just because the bass line is so great. It's really a new kind of sound for her and her first full-voiced venture since \\"Loverboy\\". <br /> <br />\\"We Belong Together\\" (9/10): A ballad that will draw in R&B and AC fans. Mariah really gives a low key performance until she belts the final \\"together\\". The song is too short, however. <br /> <br />\\"Shake It Off\\" (6/10): Everyone says that this is so great, but it's boring!! No vocal acrobatics or anything. Maybe it'll grow on me... <br /> <br />\\"Mine Again\\"(10/10): One of the best Mariah ballads ever. It feels like old school MC and the vocal arrangement is great. <br /> <br />\\"Say Somethin'\\"(7/10): I prefer \\"Crybaby\\" to this song but it's still good. I think it's a lot better than \\"Shake It Off\\" and could even be a third single. Snoop's rap seems kinda pointless but the chorus is catchy. <br /> <br />\\"Stay the Night\\"(8/10): Good song. Reminiscent of \\"Mine Again\\" in that she belts the chorus. It's sorta the prequel to \\"After Tonight\\". This song, \\"After Tonight\\" and \\"I Only Wanted\\" seem to be one connected story. <br /> <br />\\"Get Your Number\\" (6/10): JD destroys this song with his horrible Nelly impression. This song would have been a 10 if it weren't for him. Mariah's part is hot but he needs to go away. She should have got Usher for a \\"how much\\" pt 2. <br /> <br />\\"One and Only\\" (5/10): I don't like it - it seems all over the place vocally... <br /> <br />\\"Circles\\" (9/10): Beautiful! With a great whistle note. It's cute when she keeps singing even though the music has ended...she's always like, \\"yeah, yeah hmm hmmmmm\\" LOL <br /> <br />\\"Your Girl\\" (9/10): Good song but too short. The chorus' vocal arrangement reminds me of the Jackson 5 song where they sing, <br />\\"won't you be my girlfriend.\\" It's good... <br /> <br />\\"I Wish You Knew\\" (8/10): Has the same topic of \\"All I've Ever Wanted\\" from Music Box. It's a good song with the best whistle note on the entire CD. <br /> <br />\\"To the Floor\\" (6/10): All over the place...nice beat though. Maybe other people will like it. <br /> <br />\\"Joy Ride\\" (7/10): Boring and all over the place until she hits the high notes towards the end. <br /> <br />\\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (10/10): great gospel finale!! It really is inspriing. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is her best in recent years and it'll definetely reach \\"Rainbow\\" sales at least. I don't think there'll ever be another \\"Emotions\\" or \\"Mariah Carey\\" vocally but at least she's still making albums and evolving. I just wish that powerful, speaker-filling full voice would make a return for good. Great CD. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|3.0|I think it's rather telling anytime critics spend more time in their reviews rehashing an album's backstory than actually reviewing the songs themselves.  This is a promising debut, no doubt, but a few of the songs on this album are downright clunkers (If \\"Crown of Love\\" was meant as a satire, it'd be pretty clever, but I think they're actually sincere, unfortunately!), and the rest are nothing to wet yourself over.  It's a good sign that the band does seem musically ambitious, and I look forward to hearing their follow up, but there's at least twenty other indie albums of 2004 that are at least as good if not better than this one.
0790729369|4.0|Meryl Streep's accent doesn't let her down, but she doesn't seem Italian, I don't know why.  She does convey the look and feel of someone far from her home who is lost and feels abandoned, a fate that brought her to a troubling place.  I remember when they were first making this movie, it looked like Isabella Rossellini had a lock on the part (of \\"Francesca\\"), does anyone think she might have made a better Francesca than Meryl Streep?  I can't make up my mind, oh well.  Rossellini doesn't get a chance to play very many head-on romantic parts, does she, so it's hard to tell whether she has the complexity and resources to carry a movie the way Streep does.  (Remember DEATH BECOMES HER, in which Rossellini plays a minor -- very minor -- role while Streep swans it up all over the place?  It's a demonstration of old fashioned star power if ever there was one.)<br /><br />PS I do agree this DVD needs an upgrade to widescreen please!  Follow the shape of those covered bridges, extend, extend, extend!
0345442970|2.0|I bought this book roughly a year ago and decided to finally read it after reading the \\"Hand of Thrawn\\" duology (which is excellent.) <br /> <br />I found it to be very disappointing. <br /> <br />For one, the story just seems to be sluggish and a lot like a history lesson.  Don't get me wrong, it was good to see what caused the taxation of the Trade Federation routes. <br />However, just as the story seemed to be progressing--BAM!!--he goes on about what the battle droid's blaster looks like for almost two pages, or something like that.  And it totally ruins the fluidity. <br />To make matters worse, is that he throws Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan in there for the sake of tradition.  It would have been just as good to have other Jedi in there, such as Mace Windu, Kit Fisto or Plo Koon. <br />I guess the biggest spoiler for me was that Luceno seemed to try too hard.  It was almost as if he had no taste for the characters, which seemed to use lines derived from Episode 1.  The only thing he was really vivid about was their descriptions, which were more often than not, intrusive. <br />Cloak of Deception would have been a great paperback, but this abomination was apparently good enough to be published as a hardback...oh well. I only just read them.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down, authored by the legendary Richard Adams is a masterpiece of human intellect, thoughts, and writing. This long (492 pages) yet fly-by book is full of action, courage, compassion, teamwork and friendship. The book starts with a clang of worrysome rabbits escaping their home-town burrow due to a virtual bunny-psychic having premonitions of something \\"bad\\". The group, headed by their pinnacle of a leader Hazel is soon on their way throughout the contryside. The \\"elements\\", death, which way to go, animals and the pounding thought of \\"is this worth it\\" linger around the clang of rabbits throughout the risky endeavour. The clang stumbles upon other civilizations of rabbits, rivers and more but their spirits are boosted when they find an abandoned burrow they call the \\"Honeycomb\\" and their new home. They also have to fend off another civilization lead by the sinister General Woundwart attacking their burrow and they meet a clumsy, stupid yet helpful seagull named Keehar. This stunning book is certainly enjoyable- as I've read it 3 times. This great novel has entertained millions of readers worldwide and will indefinately continue to do so for more millions. Richard Adams uses great vocabulary from cover to cover and certainly ignore the common comments- \\"That book is SOO Boring\\", because they must have a completely different book. I have yet to read the sequel- Tails From Watership Down. Will it live up to the standard of its predecessor- only time will tell!
B00000263T|4.0|Accept was the German Judas Priest in the 1980s.  They offered the blistering duo guitar assault of Wolf Hoffman and  Hermann Frank and the high, raw vocals of Udo Dirkschneider.  They released two amazing metal masterpieces before their sixth album Metal Heart (Restless and Wild and Balls to the Wall).  Metal Heart came out in 1985 the year after their most famous album Balls to the Wall. To capitalize on their enhanced fame, producer Dieter Dirks (of Scorpions fame) was enlisted to give Metal Heart a more commercial sound and extra sense of melody.  More change took place when Jorg Fischer replaced Frank on guitar.  Accept's music began to move away from the dark intensity of their previous two records.  Though the potential was there for this album to mark a giant fall from the metal mountain top, it ended up being another solid album that offers some amazing tracks.     The title track is solid and was inspired by Tschaikowski and Beethoven (so says the album cover).  It sounds a little dated with the \\"It is 1999...\\" opening verse but it is one of Accept's better tracks.  \\"Midnight Mover\\" moves towards the more pop metal sound. I love this track!  It is catchy as heck!  It is my favorite track on side one.  \\"Up to the Limit\\" is solid guitar metal.  It stands out to me because the guitarists moved in sequence during the verses in the live show I saw on video.  It made the song, which I considered average, cooler.  \\"Wrong is Right\\" flies!  It is an adrenaline pumper.  \\"Screaming for a Love Bite\\" is another thing all together.  It has comical lyrics about a vicious hickey on the neck. It is also very pop metal but not the good kind like \\"Midnight Mover.\\"  It seems more of a novelty to me, so I don't take it all that seriously, though I like the guitar in it.    Side two, at first, seems rather dull.  I like the opening track \\"Too High to Get It Right\\" although it doesn't blow me away.  The next two songs don't stand out.  \\"Teach Us to Survive\\" is a little interesting in that it has a James Bond film sound.  \\"Dogs on Leads\\" has the customary raw lyrics, but musically is unmemorable. Luckily, Metal Heart ends on two high notes.  \\"Living for Tonite\\" flat out rocks!  It is my favorite on the album.  It is got an incredible beat.  \\"Bound to Fail\\" is a killer track!  Awesome number to go out on!  They are why I give this album a solid 4-star grade.  Well over half these songs are quality (7 out of 10).  Two of the lesser tracks are not so much bad as they are unremarkable.  \\"Screaming...\\" is more silly than terrible.   Metal Heart was Accept's last exceptional release. Their next album, Russian Roulette, was not be quite up to snuff and Udo would leave the band after that to start his own project U.D.O. only to return in the early 1990s when alternative music ruled.  Recommended for those like me who liked it better in the 1980s when metal ruled.
B000031XCR|5.0|What a fantastic way to leave her fans anticipating more before Celine took a well-earned break to start a family with her husband! The best of the best together with some amazing new tracks that showcase the sheer scope of Celine's sensational talent (and also present a sneak-peek of Celine's future foray into experimenting with different styles vocally and musically with \\"A New Day Has Come\\" and \\"One Heart.\\") <br />Best of the Best - it wouldn't be a true tribute to Celine without the mega-smash-hit ballads 'Beauty and the Beast', 'My Heart Will Go On', 'Because You Loved Me', 'The Power of Love' and 'Think Twice'. Listening to this album now in 2005 just proves how timeless these tracks are. Now that the Titanic Hangover is over, have another listen to \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and you may finally appreciate what a truly beautiful song it is. The inclusion of the breathtaking \\"All By Myself\\" and \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" (Celine's first English-language hit) into this collection would have made it perfect. <br />Amazing New Tracks - not only are the 7 new tracks a true reflection of just how talented Celine is, they also remind me of a very special time in my life (the last couple of months of 1999 into early 2000), so I'll always hold a soft spot for them, as I played them almost constantly through that period. <br />7. To Love You More - a new song for me, as it wasn't included on any previous Australian releases. Taro Hakase's hauntingly beautiful violin perfectly compliments Celine's soaring vocals. 7/10 <br />10. That's the Way It Is - a truly uplifting song that would make even the most broken-hearted person believe that love will find them again one day. It's such a feel-good song and never fails to put a smile on my face every time I hear it. I don't know if it helped my appreciation of the track that I was single at the time...? 10/10 <br />11. If Walls Could Talk - Sexy, sultry, mesmerizing masterpiece penned by Shania Twain's musical genius husband Robert 'Mutt' Lange. If you have the All The Way DVD, be sure to check out the video clip - it is just as gorgeous as the track itself. Celine and the set are simply beautiful! 9 and a half/10 <br />12. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face - better known for her soaring, big voice, Celine's vocals are soft, sweet and tender and do Roberta Flack's stunningly beautiful classic amazing justice. Made even more special by her dedication to husband Rene when sung live on the All The Way TV special. 8 and a half/10 <br />13. All The Way - a big fan of the ol' Crooners, I was really excited when I found out Celine would be doing a 'duet' with Frank Sinatra on this album. Vocally, it is just stunning, but the seemingly synthesized music disappointed me a little. Perhaps if it was sung with a band or orchestra, it would have been a lot more magical. 7/10 <br />14. Then You Look At Me - Celine again collaborates with James Horner and together they create another magical song for a movie (Robin Williams' Bicentennial Man)that showcases Celine's sensational vocals no end. Beautiful lyrically, as well, with a song about how troubles fade away just by looking into the eyes of a loved one. 10/10 <br />15. I Want You To Need Me -  my favourite track on the album (and favourite Celine song ever until 'I Know What Love Is' from One Heart) - powerful, passionate, heartfelt song about desperate longing for someone. The achingly-tragic desperation in Celine's strong, soaring voice reflects my own emotions at the time (yep, been there, done that!) 11/10!!!! <br />16. Live - A beautiful rendition of the lead track from the musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame that is both tender and powerful at the same time - something Celine can do with the utmost ease. 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />All in all a sensational show-case of one of the most incredibly talented performers of all time. No Celine fan should be missing this compilation from their collection! <br />
B00000G3AZ|2.0|This version of Emma was simply a vehicle to spotlight Paltrow. The scenery was spectacular, the costumes were beautiful. It is a very \\"pretty\\" movie and in that way enjoyable to watch. (with the sound turned down) Paltrow's acting was just that , acting. She was totally unbielevable as was \\"Harriet\\". The actress who played Harriet was just awful. Paltrow came off as silly, and unconvincing as Emma. The A&E version was much more like the book and the acting top notch. When watching Kate Beckinsale as Emma, you felt she really understood the character she was portraying.  She was totally natural and at ease with the dialog of that period. This version of Emma can't begin to compare with A&E'S.
B00006SFBD|4.0|I found this album really difficult to get into. It's not that it is bad or anything, and it always takes many listens to appreciate Opeth's songs, but the songs are even more complex than before. I sort of expected \\"Blackwater Park II,\\" but Opeth wasn't content repeating the same formula. Now many of their riffs are more staccato and even more complex than they were before. Here's how the songs stack up:  1. Wreath [Vocals 8/10, Musicianship 11/10, Overall 9.5/10]- The reason that I gave this a weird rating is because I think that this song could have been much better. In the beginning there is a fantastic riff, but the death vocals are different, almost high-pitched. I think Michael Akerfeldt should have used clean vocals instead. Even with this complaint, the rest of the song is excellent, and the musicianship is probably the best that Opeth has ever done.  2. Deliverence 10/10- This song once again focuses on the staccato and ultra-complex riffs, but it is still unmistakably Opeth. At about eight minutes through, the song changes into a pattern or theme that remains for the rest of the song. The drumming by Martin Lopez in this song is insane. If he did this stuff at one time (as opposed to doing a bunch of different parts, then having the production put it all togehter), he must be the most talented drummer possibly in all of Metal today, although Mike Portnoy gives him a run for his money. Great song.  3. A Fair Judgement 9/10- With the exception of the distorted guitar that appears occasionally, this sounds like a song off of the later \\"Damnation.\\" There are only clean vocals, and the song is slower than anything else on the disc. This song has an excellent guitar solo and that riff at the end is nearly perfect.  4. For Absent Friends N/A- A short instrumental that gives the listener a time to breathe before he is greeted by the pummeling \\"Master's Apprentices.\\"  5. Master's Apprentices 5/10- This song is brutal, but it lacks the fantastic riffs and hooks that make Opeth so great.  6. By the Pain I See in Others 8/10- This is Opeth's most experimental song. Some experiments (like using death vocals during an acoustic part) don't work so well, but others (like the haunting mellotron) are eerily effective. I've owned this album for about three months and this song still puzzles me because it is so different.    The album is hurt because it was not combined with Damnation like the members of Opeth had wanted. This is because record company executives (the same ones who charge us hard working people $14.99 for a CD that cost about $1.50 to make) wouldn't wait an extra year so that Opeth could have their vision fulfilled. I didn't dock a point for that, but I just thought that this album could have been better. Even so, this is definitely not a letdown, even considering that their previous album was \\"Blackwater Park.\\" This is highly recommended for all fans of metal.
B00006IU73|5.0|A simply flawless CD.  An instant classic.  It has been in my rotation since the day it came out. <br /> <br />It has elements of all my favorite bands such as Rush & Marillion <br />to name a few.  I became a fan after the 1st listen of Blackest Eye.  <br /> <br />One of the best things I've heard in the last ten years. <br /> <br />Simple enough??
B0000025YL|5.0|Accept is my favorite metal band that I've heard from the Fatherland.  Their music is consistently much better than the Scorpions.  They offer the power metal that punches the listener in the gut (or lower).  No over-the-top, progressive Helloween stuff here.  They can also play fast, blazing metal and no doubt influenced fellow Deutschland speedsters Kreator.  Accept was Germany's answer to Judas Priest and AC/DC.  They have the killer Priest-like guitar riffs and the high-pitched AC/DC-esque screeching.  Actually, Udo Dirkschneider's voice is rawer than any metal vocalist I've heard.  I don't know how he has managed to sing like that for all these decades without his vocal chords being shredded.  His voice is an acquired taste and I can understand those who do not like it.  It is not easy on the ears but his voice is perfect for the raw, heavy sound of Accept. It enhances the intensity of the music.  The guitar work of Wolf Hoffmann and Hermann Frank is incredible.  They are right up there with KK and Tipton. <br /> <br />A lot of fans point to 1984's Balls to the Wall as the ultimate Accept album.  While it is their most famous album due to the popular title track and music video, IMO, Restless and Wild (which was released the previous year) blows \\"Balls\\" to, well, the wall.  Restless (Accept's 4th album) is solid power metal.  There is nothing weak on this album and no potentially embarrassing tracks like \\"London Leatherboys\\" or \\"Love Child.\\"  It begins with a short German folk song clip.  I have an interview picture disc where Hoffmann had to explain to the French press that they did not know it was a popular song during the Third Reich (apparently, only the French media picked up on this).  It then launches into the furious \\"Fast as a Shark,\\" which probably was a precursor to thrash.  \\"Restless and Wild\\" was the first Accept track I heard and it remains my all-time favorite of theirs.  \\"Balls to the Wall\\" is intense, but \\"Restless,\\" to me, packs a heavier punch and Stefan Kaufmann's fast drum work is incredible. \\"Head of the Pack\\" has a killer rockin' beat and \\"Shake Your Heads\\" has that slow metal chanting style Accept is known for.  The 6:00 \\"Neon Nights\\" is incredible!  It has a Judas Priest Defenders of the Faith-era sound (of course, this album came out the year before Defenders). Even with those raw vocals, Udo puts a lot of emotion in this slower yet intense track. <br /> <br />The second side is similar to the first which, obviously, is a good thing.  Like side one, it begins with a ferocious, fast track \\"Get Ready.\\"  This song gets the blood pumping!  The heavy \\"Demon's Night\\" follows.  \\"Flash Rockin' Man\\" is my least favorite track on the album but that shows how solid this album is as \\"Flash\\" is no slouch but is a dark, intense track with a killer guitar riff at the bridge.  \\"Don't Go Stealing My Soul Away\\" may be the most accessible song on the record as it has a catchy melody.  The guitars really drive this track.  Like with \\"Neon Nights,\\" the second side ends with a long (6:27), slower epic song \\"Princess of the Dawn.\\"  It is an incredible track to end one of the best metal albums of all time.  If you are a fan of intense, power metal, Restless and Wild is the Accept album you cannot miss.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This was among the first Japanese anime films that I had seen, Warriors of the Wind (aka Naussica), Ninja Skroll, then Akira. These three film got me hooked on anime for life. Who cares what the those critics have to say in these threads... Akira ranks as one of the greatest films in its genre of all time period... like it or not.  <br /> <br />When I first saw this film back in 1992, I didn't quite understand all of it myself. But it didn't matter. I was visually stunned by the ground breaking animation, graphics and the detailed set designs. It took a few viewings for me to understand the complex plot. But still...didn't matter.  <br /> <br />What gets me most, is that some critics don't even see many of these films, and then give a review.  <br /> <br />Two things about a lot of Japanese anime <br /> <br />1. It's not for kids   <br /> <br />2. This art form come from a culture that is quite different from our own so why do people keep expecting the same things that the commercialized American system of film making produces is beyond me.  <br /> <br />Let us true fans of anime appreciate what this unique form of art and expression has to offer. <br /> <br />And Boo to the Nay-sayers  <br /> <br />
0064409422|5.0|I couldn't find the version of this book that I read, so I decided just to review the most popular one.  After all, the actual story is the same; it's just the cover that's different.    Lucy is the youngest of four children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and herself.  When they move in with a stranger to get away from the war that is taking place in their home area, the children explore the giant mansion in which they will be spending their days.  They come upon a rather empty room with a wardrobe against one wall, but Lucy is the only one who takes interest.  Who really would be interested in a lone wardrobe, anyway?  Lucy climbs inside, and finds herself in a magical world of strange creatures.  There, Lucy meets a kind Faun named \\"Mr. Tumnus\\".  The two become fast friends, but their meetings must be secret, since the evil White Witch, controller of the magical land, called Narnia, demands that every human be brought to her.  What will become of their friendship?  Will the White Witch continue to control Narnia in such a horrible manner?  Will Lucy tell the others about her amazing discovery?  Find out by reading this book!    I thought that this was a fantastic book!  At first I thought it looked little-kid-ish.  But after reading a few chapters, I found that it was interesting, entertaining, and in some parts, a page turner.  Some of the sentences were hard to understand, because they were so lengthy and with odd words and an old way of speaking.  But I still enjoyed this book, and I am very glad I read it!  After my mother mentioned it, I also noticed that the book has a very strong relation to the Bible, which many parents will be interested in.  It is a good book for children of all ages to read, and fans of the book will be happy to know that the official movie is coming out in December!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is great.  I can listen to the whole thing without skipping any tracks.  Its very soulful and more mature than previous Mariah albums.  So but it already!
B00003CXAW|5.0|Until this edition was released, the best Kong that DVD offered was the sappy 1976 effort at half-hearted junk film. True, the original's technology looks as crude today as it seemed amazing in 1933. The dialog, which many deem corny, accurately reflects holdovers from 1920's slang and was, after all, more indicative of the way people really talked in '33 -- compare that colorful lingo to the no-content whazzuuup of today. The timeless pathos and schmaltz of this cinematic antique derives from the movie-as-allegory on American economic Darwinism and schizo morality, a theme that many critics and viewers have pointed out. Symbolism aside, this movie was designed to evoke terror (in some scenes, it still does) as opposed to the undiluted disgust inspired by today's sadistic muck. A few years ago it seemed possible that this morality tale might languish in VHS obscurity until, sooner or later, new moviegoers discovered its unique value, not to mention moments of real photographic genius. Frankly, I'll take Fay Wray's post-Victorian hysteria any day over Lessica Lange's foray into high-salaried camp. Then again, if you closely watch the special effects of the 1976 mockery you'll see as many technical bloopers as you'd ever find in the 1933 original. Compare the results of primitive tools back then with the high-tech stuff available in 1976, and the newer version looks cheap. Anyway, if you want camp, forget the '76 disaster. Who can beat the likes of Bruce Cabot and Robert Armstrong, two of the campiest actors in moviedom, who gave unexpected life and vigor to corny lines the way no one could in 1976! And who can beat a line like \\"'Twas Beauty killed the beast.\\" You'd think that RKO would have cherished the original negs from the movie which, along with Astaire and Rogers, saved RKO's financial hide. I scarfed up this Classic Edition from Amazon as soon as its release went on sale. I'm glad I did. The transfer is excellent both visibly and audibly, though over-sharpening accentuates the original film grain that doesn't play well on LCD's. A couple of youngsters watching my in-law's DVD at their home quickly lost interest because they said the movie wasn't wide-screen and was in (gasp!) black and white. I guess this sadly says something about how today's audience has been trained to focus on effect rather than content or style. Admittedly there's much about the original KK that's antiquated. But what endures is its own innocence and scary wonder; this is a really, really primitive work that doesn't need to go technically bonkers to tell its tale. I still get caught up in thinking about the lawsuit that likely resulted from the damage created by Robert Armstrong's glitzy Broadway show of a chain-bound giant gorilla, but that's beside the point. Abandon logic, folks. Just just sink into it. It's no sillier than the 1976 mockery, but it's a far more genuine effort and was certainly a technical marvel in its day. The special features added to the two-disc edition are well worth watching. Every time I view this little masterpiece I see something different to enjoy. Even in black and white.
B000002672|3.0|Russian Roulette (1986) was Accept's sixth album.  It supposedly marked a move toward a more aggressive sound after the attempt at a more mainstream album in 1985's Metal Heart (produced by Dieter Dirks who had also produced fellow German band the Scorpions).  It also was the last Accept album with vocalist Udo Dirkschneider of the 1980s.  The screeching little metal maniac would leave to start his own band U.D.O.  Accept is one of my favorite metal bands, but Roulette does not come close to their previous masterpieces Restless and Wild & Balls to the Wall and is a big drop from the excellent Metal Heart. <br /> <br />Although Russian Roulette is a disappointment, it is still a decent 3-star album.  Half the tracks are excellent.  The rest are really bad which surprised me when I first heard it because Accept's previous 3 albums are very solid.  First the good stuff:  The cover artwork is awesome.  I love Cold War imagery.  I have a promotional poster featuring this cover and the slogan \\"Face the Music. Dare to Play Russian Roulette.\\" on my wall as I am typing this.  Though Udo and the gang may not have been the most attractive metal gods in the world, their photo definitely makes for a more appealing album cover than Balls to the Wall.  Now the best of the music:  \\"T.V. War\\" is an excellent opening track.  It is typical blistering, fast metal fans expect of Accept and works well with the cover imagery.  The title track and \\"Heaven and Hell\\" have that \\"Balls to the Wall\\" intensity.  I like the lyrics to these as well.  From \\"T.V. War\\":  \\"enemy missiles have penetrated our airspace. Impact is estimated in a matter of minutes. Good evening!\\" \\"Another Second to Be\\" is a fast and furious track.  The last song \\"Stand Tight\\" has an anthem quality to it.  Just these tracks on an EP would be 5-star. <br /> <br />But, this album offers more...unfortunately.  While Metal Heart was supposed to give Accept a more commercial sound, I think Roulette puts forth more of an attemptat a mainstream sound and it turns into a sappy mess.  There is no \\"Screaming for a Love Bite\\" here but there is \\"It's Hard to Find a Way.\\"  The opening sounds like \\"Hysteria\\" by Def Leppard.  The rest of the song has a hair band quality (ugh!).  The chanting chorus on \\"Aiming High\\" is just bad.  \\"Monsterman\\" and \\"Man Enough to Cry\\" are difficult to listen to.  They are just junk.  I recommend Roulette only to the  serious 1980s metal completest (and fans of Accept, of course).  Selective 1980s metal collectors should probably skip this one and just get Restless and Wild, Balls to the Wall and, maybe, Metal Heart.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey has never been able to sing; her voice sounds like a dog whistle. She sounds a little better on this album than the past two, but still makes Britney Spears look like Aretha Franklin. This album is a desperate attempt to \\"fit in.\\" After all, Mariah needs it. Her most recent tour couldn't even fill up high school gymnasiums and her record company is paying Fox News' Roger Friedman to hype the album. Poor Mariah.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|The Bourne Identity was a joke.  I mean I honestly laughed out loud at some of the scenes, the characters did such dumb things. <br /> <br />In this one though it was unbelievably well produced and done.  All of the action was very real with the director giving you almost a first person view of it.  The camera did get a little shaky at times but that was mostly due to the kinetic nature of the film and the director trying to give it almost a documentary look.   <br /> <br />I hated the Bourne Identity, but this was just a huge breath of fresh air.  I was also relieved to hear that the same director is supposed to return for the Bourne Ultimatum.
B000001ZS8|5.0|This is just a great great cd much more ambitious then cds like oxagen and equanox and quite a bit differnet  <br />if your a fan of Laurie Anderson the you will love this cd  <br />My only complant is it ends the last songs seems to be going along and just ends I guess they ran out of LP time I just wish it was longer  <br />I love it !!
B000063TDY|5.0|I was not aware of Saxon during their 1980s heyday and have only recently started checking out their albums.  I found Solid Ball of Rock (as well as Denim and Leather) on cassette for $1.  Let's just say, it was $1 well spent and I am now spending more to get more releases from their long discography.  Where has this band been all my life?!  I've really been missing out!  What surprises me about this album is that it came out in 1990 when metal was beginning to drop off in quality.  There is no drop off here.  The only thing I don't like about this album is the silly title yet that is just what it is; a solid ball of rock.  I could review each track individually, but I would be typing the same words and phrases like \\"awesome,\\" \\"kicks,\\" \\"catchy melodies,\\" \\"killer guitar riffs,\\" and \\"amazing vocals.\\"  Every track rocks and as soon as I think I found a favorite, I find another \\"favorite.\\"  I will single out one song \\"Requiem (We Will Remember).\\"  It is so amazing and beautiful that I get choked up when I hear it.  It does go on a bit so having the single version included as a bonus track makes this album just about perfect.  I cannot recommend this album highly enough.  Just check out the audio clips and, if you like what you hear, don't hesitate to buy this album because it will not disappoint.  And if you like this, check out Saxon's latest Lionheart which I am beginning to like as well as this one.
B0007P3582|1.0|Once upon a time \\"musicians\\" could read and write music. They played instruments and if they sung they could get past the 1st round of American Idol. That's changed and this album is proof. Curtis Jackson's fame is not (thankfully) based on any musical skills that can be discerned. He's famous because of Eminem and because, for some reason psychologists have yet to explain, there are those who consider drugs, gangs, mistreatment of women and violence \\"cool\\".  He is yet another young man from a whole generation of fatherless, poor, angry men.  While he preaches about poverty, his violent past, the glory of gangs and contempt of women, he travels between his multimillion dollar homes with body guards, lawyers, PR guys and groupies.  A recent purchase of a custom-made bullet-proof vests for his six-year old son requires no further commentary.    <br /> <br />Eminem had quality songs even if one disagreed with the subject matter but if you're looking for anything original, forget it. You've heard it all a 1000 times before - hos, prison, gangs,  alienation, blah blah filled with enough obscenities to keep an army of bleepers busy.  But their shock value has vanished with widespread use and they're now as simply nouns or adjectives like most people would say \\"pal\\" or \\"loud\\" or \\"famous\\"...\\"That MF's got a  MF car with MF hyped mufflers that sound MF bad\\".  You get the picture.  The most notable quality about this CD is its marketing - a media blitz relying on an edgy title, staged tough guy photos, a \\"street rep\\" and a series of interviews with fawning \\"journalists\\". 50 cent is on MSN, CNN, Time, MTV - even FOX - although his songs receive minimal air time for obvious reasons. Wait for something REALLY original.
031286504X|4.0|Here's a summary of what's inside this book.<br /><br />(1) The title story, which takes up 50% of the book.  As you can guess by now, this is a great story.  However, what you may not know is that this is more a post-apocalypse story and less a vampire story.  The epidemic of vampirism which leads to the collapse of civilization and to the main character becoming the \\"last man on Earth\\" is more of just a setup.  The story is more concerned with how the main character deals with being alone, with trying to get supplies while avoiding getting killed, finding meaning in continuing to survive when everyone you care about is dead, etc.  Matheson does an excellent job at this, but don't be surprised if you're expecting a thorough analysis of vampirism or if you're expecting a new exploration of vampire culture.  My only regret with this story is that the ending is somewhat abrupt, as if Matheson couldn't come up with a satisfying ending.  It's still a great read overall though.<br /><br />(2) The other 50% of the book contains various short stories of various lengths, written from the 50's to the 80's.  You can actually tell how Matheson has refined his writing skills over the years because his earlier stories are somewhat clunky, doesn't grab you as much and are sometimes too verbose for their own good.  These would be _Witch War_, _Dance of the Dead_, Dress of White Silk_, _Mad House_, and the _Funeral_.  They're ok but not stellar.<br /><br />(3) The later stories are short, concice, grab you immediately and won't let go, and Matheson really gets you to feel a sense of fear and dread as the stories progress.  You know that you're in the hands of a master craftsman who knows how to skillfully weave a engrossing and frightening story.  These would be _Buried Talents_, _The Near Departed_, _Prey_, _From Shadowed Places_, and _Person to Person_.<br /><br />(4) One thing to note though is that these stories all have a Twilight Zone feel to them.  You have to imagine Rod Serling presenting these stories and you have to be in a mood for an \\"interesting\\" setup for each story, be willing to suspend your disbelief and be curious about how the initial setup of each story will pay off.  If you're in that mindset, the stories will be a lot of fun, especially the latter stories which feel like very good Twilight Zone episodes.  That's not surprising since Matheson has written a large number of Twilight Zone episodes.<br /><br />(5) Also interesting to note is that the title story has been adapted to film twice (_Last Man on Earth_ starring Vincent Price and _Omega Man_ starring Charlton Heston).  The _Prey_ story was adapted to a film (_Trilogy of Terror_ starring Karen Black).  This isn't surprising either since a large number of his stories have made it into film, like _The Incredible Shrinking Man_, _The Legend of Hell House_, _Somewhere in Time_, _What Dreams May Come_, _Stir of Echoes_ just to name a few.ine Rod Serling presenting these stories and you have to be in a mood for an \\"interesting\\" setup for each story, be willing to suspend your disbelief and be curious about how the initial setup of each story will pay off.

B00005JNTV|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story line is fit for only the insane and serial killers to love.  This picture has so many gruesome characters and plots it is mind boggeling.  It starts with a character who kidnaps young girls, slices them with a straight razor, rapes and then kills them.  The next character kidnaps women, makes them watch as he eats their body parts, cuts off their heads and mounts them on a wall and then has his pet wolf eat the rest of the body.  This character segways into a bishop, who also enjoys eating the bodies of the women with his friend.  And this depraved plot goes on and on.   <br />What probably most amazed me was that it didn't appear that anyone else in the theatre was remotely upset with  what they were seeing.  I walked out of the movie after the bishop was murdered because I had had enough.  For the serial killers and sadomasachists out there; this is your kind of movie.  For anyone else with any sense of morality; save your money and some nightmares.  Rodriguez (the director) is proud of this work and my only response is \\"God help us.\\"
B0007GAERG|3.0|I decided to give \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" a few listens before writing this review since it did not grip me at first. It must be hard for an artist to live up to the standards set by songs like \\"Underneath the stars\\", \\"I Still Believe\\", \\"Hero\\" and \\"Someday\\". \\"Glitter\\" was the beginning of Mariah's downfall in the music world. Despite her powerful voice on \\"Never too far\\", it did not win her much praise. \\"Charmbracelet\\" did not do wonders for her either with her whispery style of singing and lackluster songs. Yet, \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" just might be the beginning of her return to form.<br /><br />  This album has clearly been made with high sales and newer musical tastes in mind. This is evident based on substantial input from artists like Snoop Dogg, Nelly and Jermaine Dupri. This might not be in sync with the expectations of those that have been ardent fans since the early 90s. Fortunately, Mariah has done her best to please both her adult contemporary music fans as well as potential new fans.<br /><br />  Her first single \\"It's like that\\" is a typical \\"flavor of the moment\\" track that has what it takes to make a dent on American singles charts these days. The charts in the rest of the world may not indicate very high numbers for this single. I almost dismissed this album solely on the basis of this single. Fortunately, her second single \\"We belong together\\" renewed my interest in her music. While it does belong in the same league as some of her classics, it has all the ingredients that make her music pleasant and enjoyable. It is definitely the best song on the album. The other fabulous musical moments on this album are on tracks like \\"Circles\\" and \\"I wish you knew\\" - reminders of Mariah's glory days.<br /><br />  I do not consider this album to be a musical milestone for Mariah but it is definitely the precursor for better things to come from her. Her voice is still as infectious and beautiful as ever and the songs I mentioned earlier are some of the finest ballads of the year.<br /><br />Songs for the Mariah Carey fan: We belong together, Circles, I wish you knewngs for the Mariah Carey fan: We belong together, Circles, I wish you knew
B0007Y4USW|5.0|The emancipation is an awesome album.  I have always been a fan of mariahs and she almost never disappoints me.  This album was a shocker.. it was far better than i had imagined.  She reverts back to her \\"old\\" style for some of the songs and keeps it moving for others.  There is something on here for everyone.  Take a listen and half the songs are great.. keep listening and they all will win your heart.   <br /> <br />I say this is more than worthy to have at least one copy of.  Mariah has been critised for her \\"whispery\\" voice and for constantly working with rappers.. with this disc she left everyone is silence.. it really is truly great to have Mariah back at the top of the game.. but speak to any true fan and we'll tell you we knew she never left.
B0007GAERG|4.0|\\"Mariah Carey has never been able to sing; her voice sounds like a dog whistle. She sounds a little better on this album than the past two, but still makes Britney Spears look like Aretha Franklin.\\" <br /> <br />Okay, whoever wrote this idiotic review must be completely deaf and stupid. Britney Spears's name should never be used in the same sentence as Mariah, Aretha or any other real singer. With that said, this is a very good album for Mariah. I have been a fan of her's since she first came out and I thought that vocally she was in her prime in her pre-Butterfly days. Once she started going to the whisper style singing and overproduced hip-hip collaborations, she started to go downhill a bit. She strained her voice and it started to sound scratchy, even when she hit the whistly notes (which she completely overdoes now). I still don't think her voice is as pure as it was when she first came out, but with all that said, Mariah can still sing better than 90 percent of the artists out today. In fact despite all of the singers out there there are only a few really good vocalists on the radio. Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Tamia, Kelly Clarkson (maybe), and that's really about it and Mariah can still outsing most of them. On this Album she definetely sounds better vocally than on her previous three attempts. She had flashes of brilliance on Rainbow (Bliss), Charmbracelet (My Saving Grace) and even Glitter (Never Too Far). But overall, I wasen't as impressed with her voice on those albums as I was on Daydream, Music Box, Emotions and her debut Album. On Emancipation of Mimi, she definetely sounds closer to the old Mariah, because she uses more of her complete range (lower and upper registers) on most of the songs and not just the whisper, whistle or belting that she is more known for now. The most of the ballads on the album are sung very strong and the up-tempo dance/hip-hop tracks are much better than the ones on her last few albums. Welcome back Mariah!
B000065VA1|4.0|Before this album Peter Gabriel had achieved a critical success by music critics. Especially, his third album is the real masterpiece. Gabriel had small but faitful fan group that bought his albums. He was some kind of cult artist that didn't want to make mainstream music.<br /><br />Something changed time period from 1982 to 1986 In 1982 Gabriel released Security, which was go gold on the strength of the startling video for \\"Shock the Monkey.\\" Just as his solo career was taking off, Gabriel participated in a one-shot Genesis reunion in order to finance his WOMAD - World of Music, Arts and Dance - Festival. After founding Real World, Inc. - a corporation devoted to developing bridges between technology and multiethnic arts<br /><br />I believe that when Gariel was composing So's songs, he had some sort of instict to say: \\"these tracks good be hits!\\" Ok! It was only my guess because I don't know the truth. But his music really changed so much mainstream direction on the So that it couldn't be coincidence. Anyway, So sold millions copies and it had many hits(\\"Sledgehammer\\" hit number one,\\"Big Time\\" reached the Top Ten and \\"In Your Eyes\\" hitted the Top 30)<br /><br />Allright! Why So is more pop-tuned and mainstream album than its predecessors. Let's see! Opening track \\"Red Rain\\" is a really good exemple because it has easy listening melody and catchy chorus. \\"Red Rain\\" can call a pure pop song! \\"Sledgehammer\\" is also pop-oriented song which has also &Aacute;frican music sounds. \\"Don't Give Up\\" is a beautiful and emotionally loaded pop-ballad. \\"That Voice Again\\" has easy accepted synth melodies and chorus. It's not surprise that \\"In Your Eyes was a top 30 hit because it's not irritating or hard listening song. \\"Big Time's\\" success makes me wonder because in my mind, it's too long and booring song without special hooks.  Third of this album isn't mainstream material at all. \\"Mercy Street is a dark melody ballad that takes time to get in. In my opinion, is the best song of all album. \\"We Do What We're Told(Milgram's 37)\\" is a strange and scaring song. It reminds me Gabriel's forth album! \\"This Is The Picture(Excelent Birds)\\" sounds like early Depeche Mode.<br /><br />Although So is the Gabriel's most pop-oriented and mainstream album it's my top 3 Gabriel album. First and Third are more experiental and progressive than So which I still listen most often.  So is almost masterpiece but not it lacks for that status for little bit. The Unity of songs is not so perfect than third album. There are some songs that breaks entity for exemple \\"Big Time\\". I would give So 4,5 stars album, but it is not possible here(maybe someday).<br /><br />Finally, So is your album who likes great pop songs made by skill and wants to listen Gabriel's most easy listening material. Many proge lovers can also likes this when their first shock reaction is over. Gabriel is a real musical camelot that doesn't make two simular albums!

B0007GAERG|5.0|Judging by the majority of these reviews, it's reassuring to know that America still believes in good singing and genuine talent. Mariah has always been there when we needed her the most. She's one of the most consistent recording artists of our time. The music industry really needs this right now. Music sales are depressed and there's not a whole lot to look forward to on the immediate release schedule. A few items here and there. This CD has given me hope that brighter things are on the horizon. It took a lot of courage for Mariah to put her game face back on and head into the studio. And like a real pro, she came back with an very likeable record. GREAT JOB!!!

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Let me tell you something, britney spears would have long been gone out of the spotlight if she wasn't doing stupid, outrageous stunts to grab the attention of the media. This album is really bad. Her vocals are terribly computerized & the whole album is pretty much over produced, polished dance pop. All her music consists of light weight dance pop that gives her an excuse to crawl around half naked in her videos. She can't sing & she can't write or produce music. She's not an artist, she's a pin-up model! Her appeal & what sold her music was her sexuality & the media hype, not talent! This album is not worth buying because it's the same as her last three albums along with some hip-hop beats & more computerized vocals. Have fun being pregnant britney, looks like you won't be doing nude photo shoots for a while.
B00009AOBI|5.0|My 10th grade english teacher told his class a story about one of his students who was in a serious car accident leaving him clinging to life and when he did survive, leaving him severely disfigured. The main thing he wanted was to go back to school, to be with friends, and live his life again. It was a sad story that our teacher told us while he choked up because he was close to this student. The student died at only age 16. As we were told the story, we thought of this movie, called the mask. The difference was, the boy in mask had a rare, unpredictable, and incurable disease. Also a true story, mask is a moving and heart-wrenching tearjerker that is good for children to watch as well as adults. It's a life lesson to appreciate what you have, and to not discriminate against others because no one is perfect. Kids can be brutally cruel and it is hard enough being a teenager and dealing with everyday problems like peer pressure, acceptance, fitting in, meeting girls etc. But to also have an extremely noticeable disfigurement and to deal with teasing and staring, and laughing, it almost seems unbearable to endure. But this boy was stronger than most, and seemed used to people's ignorance, but of course not completely unphased. I.E. When he finally falls in love with a blind girl from a summer camp, and after they all go home his calls to her are ignored. He later finds out that her parents want her to have nothing to do with him. They too, were prejudice against him which is a bit baffling considering most parents of blind children are more compassionate because they raise their children to overcome obstacles and discrimination for their disability. The fact that they were so rude to him when they first met was infuriating. The other part of the story was his mother and her drug problems and premiscuous acts. He does help her, but the stress and hardships he faces makes you constantly feel sad and angry at the people who treat him badly. It's a tearjerker but also a very important tale about courage, love, respect, and compassion.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I actually prefer Mariah's voice on this album than any of her others. It just seems like she's struck the right balance. It's more about songs and substance than pure vocal theatrics. She applies her vocal flourishes in all the right places. It's not used as a device to get your attention, it just feels right. Some have said her voice has lost richness, but I would have to disagree. I don't think the quality of her voice has diminished at all. Her voice is more compelling on this album than any of her previous work. I think \\"We Belong Together\\" is the best song she's ever recorded. Yes, better than \\"Vision of Love\\" and \\"My All.\\" Why? Because it's more intense, more immediate, there's a greater sense of urgency. I'm just more moved by this collection. Mariah's voice has a greater emotional appeal now. She's been through a lot, so it's been channeled more into the music this time around. Meaning, it's given her voice more layers and greater depth.  <br /> <br />Thank you Mariah for believing in yourself and giving it another go. We all needed this. <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers really show off great songs with very good melodies its rock n roll with a poppy 80's feel to it........highlights on the album are Jenny was a friend of mine.......Somebody Told Me..........Smile like you mena it.........and Andy Your a Star...............................n e ways get it now 4 1/2 stars
B0007OCG56|2.0|When would films stop emphasizing on stereotypes and give imported actors an opportunity to show the talent they have?  Sad...must watch to understand....
0765301598|1.0|All they need to do is connect the dots.    Up to this point I felt Dune-Lite is better than no Dune at all.  Sure they're fluffy and one dimensional, and don't really touch on themes/philosophy in the depth that F.H. did.  But he left some big literary shoes to fill, so I was willing to enjoy these new novels for what they are.       The Butlerian Jihad started out OK, unfortunately the last installment is just a fiasco that gets worse and worse leading up to and including the title battle itself. The story is Mystery Science Theater 3000 fare, the characters are B-movie archetypes, and the dialogue is mawkish soap opera cheese (even from the robots!). The villains have become corny silver-age comic book fiends. The Titans have become the Transformers. This book is really a slap in the face, it should never have been released.    My biggest gripe is the dialogue. I've never read a book before that made me roll my eyes and groan \\"ugh\\" out loud, ever. Hamfisted, insipid, drivel. Here are some memorable gems:   -The Mentat origin: \\"I am your mentor, you are my mentee...You need a nickname...I will call you my Mentat\\". Wow, so this is one of the origins we've been waiting for?   -\\"A Butler serves unto no one\\". This corny pun wasn't even clever the first time I read it, after the twelfth time I felt like puking. The fact that it's someone's dying words is criminal.   -\\"Spice Rush\\", yep just like the old west. There's spice in them thar dunes!   -Omnius' \\"multiple personality disorder\\" Cyber-Sybil?   -The retro-virus, Compound X, piranha mites. Muhuhahahaha! Is Dr. Doom collaborating with Omnius now?   -\\"Death to the Machines!\\" No need to explain this one.   -Agamemnon's battelship form is a \\"demonic Pterodactyl\\". He's a Dino-bot!   -\\"It's about taking the think out of the thinking machines\\" Until he said this, Vorian was the one redeeming character of this series. At this point in the book I realized someone was playing a joke on me.   -Erasmus was another bright spot in this series, but he went from being the sadistic scourge of humanity to a mawkish drama queen. Yuck.   -The worm jousting - this is a joke, right? WORM JOUSTING? Shaitan reduced to cockfighting?  Don't believe me?  Look at the cover of the book!    The ending is absurd.  All they needed to do was tie things up credibly - we know what the end result is going to be, it's the journey that needs to be fleshed out with some integrity.  Everything is just way too easily, conveniently, and cleanly tied up, like they phoned it in.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a light read, but this one was a bomb.     The blame for this book goes beyond Herbert and Anderson, where were the editors?  Seriously.     Somebody please tell me this was all just a joke.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I bought Gavin's album about 6 months ago, I listen to it non-stop. It is one of those records you never get sick of. With such a mix of pop, rock, soul and r&b, this melodic album is nothing but a best seller. Everyone who enjoys music should get a copy of this album, without a doubt I know you'll love it just as much as I do! Listen to tracks like Chariot, Chemical Party, and Follow through. Not only does it satisfy your listening needs it gives you a feeling of relief to finally hear an artist as true and talented as Mr. Degraw. Check it out you have nothing to loose!!! -- Jena

B0002IU988|1.0|<br />...thank God Creed broke up!  I'd be TREMENDOUSLY disappointed if this is what had come out for the next Creed record. <br /> <br />I've spun the album a few times and attended two concerts (though I only went for the sake of Alter Bridge's OUTSTANDING opening band, SubmerseD - if you want a GOOD rock album, go buy In Due Time).  Everything that I loved about Creed is missing from this album.  Tremonti's lyrics are amateurish and cliche (when they're remotely comprehendable, which isn't often).  The skill on the guitar is tremendous, to be sure, but it lacks direction and passion.  The songs suffer tremendously from lack of creativity - Creed had a tendancy to sound the same, particularly with their hit singles (book numbers such as Weathered and Faceless Man, however, show an enormous talent for songwriting).  However, One Day Remains reminds me of a Nickelback album - except the songs aren't as catchy.  If you're going to write a bunch of songs that sound the same, at least make them good songs instead of second-rate ones.   <br /> <br />I've heard raves about Scott Phillip's drumming... I want to ask if anybody's heard a REALLY skilled rock drummer?  When I see Flip launch into a five-minute drum solo a la Daniel Adair, I'll start raving about his drumming.  Until then... he's a nice guy, but he's not the greatest drummer.   <br /> <br />Myles Kennedy... he's a gifted vocalist, in that his voice is very trained and he has a great range.  When I first heard him I thought of a little Chris Cornell.  Too bad his voice may as well be nails on a chalkboard for me - I can't stand the piercing tenor.  Nor are the songs very singable - the melodies seem constructed more for the purpose of showing off Kennedy's range than allowing for the enjoyment of singing along by the average person.   <br /> <br />This is one album I'm glad I never paid money for.
B000002HJR|5.0|I don't remember how I stumbled across this album, but as a fan of Pantera I bought it loyally when I learned Phil was at the helm. Little did I know I would be purchasing an album that transcends the frontier of music to become one of the few that has \\"it\\". Somehow each track is just right how it is, and somehow each track adds to the general groove of the entire album so that it becomes more than the sum of its parts. If you're even reading this then you must be at least somewhat interested in the genre in which these bandmates participate in. Just buy it.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I don't know why everyone is complaining about the new versions.  If you don't like the changes (I don't), then buy the originals on DVD. <br /> <br />I have a very nice DVD version of the originals without Lucas' 1997 edits that I bought in NYC.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Listen to the album to believe why i gave it 5 stars.
B000060P79|5.0|\\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\", Simple Plan's debut album, was an excellent debut album. Even though I don't consider this band to be 100% punk, it is still a great band and I think these guys have their own style lyrically and vocally. Don't let the album art fool you, though. That's what kept me from purchasing this album at first. I thought this band was a cheap copy of Blink 182. After listening to the singles \\"I'd Do Anything\\" and \\"Addicted\\", I felt like giving the entire album a try, but from looking at the front cover I almost concluded that this band was just another wanna-be Blink 182 punk rock band. Then when \\"Perfect\\" was released as a single I made my final decision and finally bought the album. That's when I realized that I had been fooled by the album's front cover. The songs in this album are lyrically too juvenile and musically more pop-punk than punk, but they're still good and I think everyone can relate to some of these songs. Pierre Bouvier's voice is actually very unique and really stands out compared to other bands.    Below is my track-by-track review.    1. \\"I'd Do Anything\\" - (5/5) Excellent song with pretty good lyrics. One of the hits from this album. The lyrics basically talk about wanting to retrieve a lost love.    2. \\"The Worst Day Ever\\" - (5/5) This is one of my favorite songs in the album. I think this is a song that we can all relate to every once in awhile (\\"And I feel like I'm living the worst day over and over again...\\").    3. \\"You Don't Mean Anything\\" - (5/5) This is a more uptempo song. Good lyrics.    4. \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" - (5/5) This is another excellent song, even though it is a little more juvenile than the previous three songs. The lyrics basically talk about a \\"kid\\" who is bored at home while everyone else is out having more fun than him.    5. \\"When I'm With You\\" - (5/5) Another good song with good lyrics. The lyrics talk about being into someone who is not interested in you.    6. \\"Meet You There\\" - (5/5) This is another one of my favorite songs in this album. The lyrics talk about losing someone you love and wishing you had done or said things that you didn't.    7. \\"Addicted\\" - (5/5) This is another one of the hits from this album. Everyone has heard this song. It was a little too overplayed.    8. \\"My Alien\\" - (3/5) This song is just okay. One of my least favorite songs in the album. The lyrics in this song are more creative.    9. \\"God Must Hate Me\\" - (5/5) Excellent song with fun lyrics. The lyrics talk about someone crashing his dad's car and feeling hated and cursed by God. One of my favorites.    10. \\"I Won't Be There\\" - (5/5) Great song with good lyrics as well. Nothing much to say about this song except that it's enjoyable.    11. \\"One Day\\" - (5/5) Another great song. It talks about someone being tired about living in his home (\\"One day I won't take this anymore, one day I'll be old enough to do what I want to...\\").     12. \\"Perfect\\" - (5/5) Another hit from this album. This is the song that made me purchase this album in the first place. It talks about someone who did not grew up to be what his dad wanted him to be.    13. \\"Grow Up/My Christmas List\\" - (3/5) These are actually two songs in one track. First comes \\"Grow Up\\", a song about someone not wanting to be told to grow up. Then comes \\"My Christmas List\\". That's what the song is about. It's just about someone telling Santa what he wants for Christmas.     Now, this album is an excellent debut album. There is no mediocre song in this album. Please don't listen to the negative reviews out there. You will experience no regrets from purchasing this album.
B00000099Y|5.0|After almost a decade of listening to this album, I have recently come to the conclusion that Aenima is my favorite album of all time. It heads the short list of albums I revere such as Black Sabbath's Paranoid and Down's NOLA. Even after a decade I still find myself probing the depths of it and admiring the craftsmanship of the music.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Brief synopsis: This latest product of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's twisted imaginations involves Thunderbirds-esque puppetry; the current state of global affairs summarized in lots and lots of collateral damage courtesy of the titular team (\\"f--k yeah!\\"); satire of everything ranging from Broadway musicals to Muslim terrorists to Matt Damon; the gruesome on-screen deaths of many Hollyweird limousine leftists; the decimation of the Effel Tower and The Sphinx, amongst other monuments; and acts of marionette coitus, martial arts, and vomiting in all their puerile glory.<br /><br />Conservative prudes, P.C.-obsessed liberals, and everyone else are bound to be offended by at least some portion of this film.<br /><br />Needless to say, purchase is mandatory. I'm reserving my copy as we speak..
B0007GAERG|5.0|What is wrong with all the stupid idiots who are hating on the new album from Mariah?      The album is filled with hot tracks, powerful ballads, excellent vocals from Mariah as well as the collaborators.    Stand out tracks include:  \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Get your number\\", \\"Joyride\\", \\"One and Only\\" and definitely \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\"      A true fan should get this one as well as people who are non-fans of Mariah should definitely pick up a copy and listen for themselves.  It's the best album so far and probably will be for the rest of the year.
B0008JFMEC|1.0|As the previous reviewer stated. The pricing structure for UMD's is absolutely ludicrous. I understand the ones priced at $19.99, but that seems as if it should be the upper limit. Pricing discs for $29.99 for a no frills UMD is unbelievable. Hopefully SONY will realize people aren't going to pay thirty dollars for a movie they already own on DVD just so they can watch it on their PSP. They will buy one or two movies as I plan to. Solely for the coolness factor. Nobody is going to own a movie collection on their PSP though, unless they are rich. Even rich people will likely be angry about being price gouged. Sony needs to wake up and start pricing these discs inline with DVD's at the most. Pricing them above the DVD cost is absurd.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City is definitely one of the must-see movies for this century, but be warned, this is not your regular kind of movie. If you want to see pedestrian, boring fantasy movie making, or trite, one-dimensional moralizing, stick to the horrendousness that is the Star Wars Prequels.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is far, far more than just a splatter-fest although it's got violence a-plenty.  If violence worries you at all, then DON'T GO.  However, if you can dig it, then I'll say this: the physical violence in this movie is deliberately cartoonish, and therefore much less psychically scarring than say \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  There's other kinds of violence in Miller's creative work, however and on that I'll say more later.<br /><br />The movie is visually beautiful. It is _very_ much in keeping with Miller's graphic novels, but whilst  the graphic novels were completely black and white, Sin City the movie is actually super-saturated dark blues and grays. There is very little real black in the movie except Rosario Dawson's outfit  (what little there was of it anyway).<br /><br />This point has also been made before but it's worth saying again:  The movie is NOT meant to be realistic. This is the key to Frank Miller's whole visual style (of which more below).  If you like your movies literal and simpering then STAY AWAY from this movie. You won't like it, and you don't belong in the movie theater.<br /><br />As many, many other people have pointed out, the movie is _meant_  to be stylized, so the acting, the dialog and the visual style are all meant to be larger than life. Good grief. Have we become so blinkered, mentally-enslaved and unimaginative as a society that people can't even figure that out?  What stylization does is allow the ideas and emotional contours in the movie (and in Miller's graphic novels) to become more salient.  As with other non-realist forms of art, the deliberate break from naturalistic images allows us to see past the images to the ideas and feelings beneath them, and that's what a lot of people seem to have missed.<br /><br />On the subject of the acting, yes Mickey Rourke and Benicio did great jobs, but they also had the best lines.  I think the WOMEN in this movie acted their asses off, especially given the limited amount of talking they had.  What this meant was that a lot had to be conveyed by physical movement and facial expression.  Dawson did this wonderfully as Gail, the leader of the Second Amendment -hoisting prostitutes, and Jessica Alba did a pretty good job too although she hid way too much behind her  \\"Little Nancy\\" persona. This, I think, gave her much less to work with and so Alba's Nancy wasn't nearly as interesting a character as Dawson's Gail.  Personally I thought Devon Aoki's Miho was great.  No emoting, but then she wasn't supposed to. Before the movie came out, I had read some fan-boy stuff about how Zhang Ziyi would have been a better choice for Miho, but I don't think so.  Ms. Zhang is far too given to facial histrionics. Ms Aoki was perfect.  Also excellent was Brittany Murphey as Shellie the waitress, this was a spot-on casting decision, as Shellie has Murphey's Jersey Girl persona written all over her.<br /><br />Lastly, one of the defining themes in Miller's writing career from \\"Batman: the Dark Knight Returns\\", through \\"Ronin\\" and \\"Daredevil\\" to Sin City, is his profound contempt for the hypocrisy and self-servingness of those in authority.  Those who are attracted to order and paternal moralism will hate this movie because these are exactly the things that Miller has his characters take on.  One of the things that Sin City and Dark Knight share is the stark distinction between violence you do while doing the right thing and violence done while going along to get paid, or because you enjoy using your authority to prey on others. _This_ is the difference between the villains and the heroes in this movie.<br /><br />Violence then, in Miller and Rodriguez's world becomes away for the dispossessed to reclaim their dignity and agency.  It's fantasy, it's id-laden but it's meant to be a work of fiction not a blue print for social justice.<br /><br />Note that Miller does not say that violence is 100% successful: Both Marv and Hartigan must die at the end of their respective vengeance quests.  In fact, the only male figure who survives is (interestingly) Dwight, the only guy who allies himself with powerful female characters (Rosario Dawson's Gail and Devon Aoki's Miho). Lone males, it seems, are more vulnerable than men and women working together.<br /><br />Miller's Sin City  is definitely less diverse and more androcentric than the Wachowskis' Matrix universe, but you don't have to be PC all the time to make a useful point.  Sure the prostitutes were all female, and sure this leaves the whole business of who the sex trade is set up for to one side. But the prostitutes in Sin City were independant workers, running their own society without male bosses and profiteers (a very far cry from the real-world sex trade, of course) and their independance is what they were fighting to protect.  For this reason, and because the real villains in this peice were all male. I think this is a far more complex movie than a lot of people want to think it is.  Skimpy outfits and sex work does not simply equate to misogyny.<br /><br />Go see this movie. It is a complex and compelling riff on morality, friendship, fighting city hall and (mostly) losing, getting old and getting by.  The delighted vengefulness which imbues this movie comes from nothing so much as our own outrage when the suits and their toadying minions stomp down on the rest of us: \\"Kill him for me Marv. Kill him good.\\"agency.  It's fantasy, it's id-laden but it's meant to be a work of fiction not a blue print for social justice.

6301971558|4.0|Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly:-)  They all deserve credit for this John Ford-African-adventure. The photography is breathtaking and the plot likewise but predictable. But it doesn`t matter in the hands of these stars... there were a REASON they were stars and they carry if beautifully on their shoulders.<br /><br />Gable and Kelly`s romance was widely written about in 1953-1954 and while many says she was his 2nd Carole Lombard(the love of his life and tragically killed in a planecrash in 1942) others suggests it was a 1-nite-stand... However, Gable admired her immensely(being the outdoorman he was), especially when he found her crying between takes - asking her why she did so - she replied; \\"I saw this lion walking by me here by the lake... and it was the most beautiful sight...\\"<br /><br />Yup, he felt she was a spunky girl. Miss Gardner revealed after Kelly`s death that the two girls walked by the natives and Gardner pulled out one of the men`s ............. and replied; \\"Frank`s bigger than that!\\"(Frank Sinatra, her then husband) to a purple red shocked Grace Kelly.<br /><br />Kelly later recalled that they spent Xmas in Africa that year and that Sinatra bought presents for everyone and played the role of Santa Clause and even got John Ford to recite the Christmas Story.<br /><br />Ford was not to Kelly`s liking. At one point he shouted; \\"Kelly - what the hell are you doing?\\"... She stammered something written in the script, to which he replied \\"We`re shooting a picture, not a damn script...!\\"<br /><br />Well, back to the picture itself...A letdown are the gorilla scenes(obvious made in the studio, and the intercut no good)... But on the whole; a watchable film from the era of GREAT HOLLYWOOD STARS.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|This album is great. Mariah is really singing again. All the songs are catchy, with great hooks... you can listen to this CD without having to skip any songs unlike \\"Charmbracelet\\". You will not regret buying this record, and it's safe to say that Mariah is the best female singer out there!
B00004STPT|5.0|I am a string player (Cello) and have been so for 7 years and hearing this soundtrack has inspired both myself and my orchestra. Its our dream to play this music. I love 'Now We Are Free'. This song is so beautiful and emotional that it can literally bring tears to your eyes. Its a must have for anyone.
B000053GTK|3.0|This is a remaster with good sound quality.  Like all Gentle Giant albums, there have been several different CD releases of In A Glass House, with varying sound quality.  You need to be careful when buying a Gentle Giant CD to ensure you get good quality.    The original album was 37 minutes.  This has an additional 20 minutes of bonus live material.      There is a 30th Anniversary version of In A Glass House coming out soon.  It will be much cheaper than this CD.  I understand that it also has the bonus material, but I haven't been able to confirm that.    This is album that Gentle Giant fans speak most fondly about.  I don't know why.  Maybe it is the nice cover that had a cel image of the band on top a another image of the band for a \\"3D\\" effect.  Or maybe it is because the LP was never released in the US, coming out just as the band was starting to gain some popularity (between Octopus and Power and Glory).  In spite of being available only as a costly import, it was the third biggest selling Gentle Giant LP in the US.  This album kind of got lost in the shuffle as Gentle Giant was moving from Columbia records to Capitol.  So, when more fans discovered Gentle Giant when Free Hand was released, those earlier collectors could amaze their friends by pulling out a copy of In A Glass House.    The sound is much different than other Gentle Giant albums.  In A Glass House actually describes the music.  The album starts out with glass breaking.  The music on this entire album has that sharp, shattering sound.  Derek Shuman had left the group, so there is very little sax and no flute.  There is a lot of high ringing vibes and guitar work.      Gentle Giant's live preformances during this period also had a starker, stripped down sound.  At some points in concert, they were much more like a convention rock band.    In the next three ablums after this, Gentle Giant would return to the lusher, more mellow sound.
B00006RINF|5.0|<br /> <br />Lacuna Coil is a great band with no doubt;and you can look at them as the ancestors;or with a much more gothic phrase;sires of popular bands with gothic roots like evanescence,and i can also say Lacuna Coil;is what Evanescence(another great but much younger band)should look up to while taking their music from popular gothic to something real dark. <br /> <br />Both Singers are very talented;but especially Christina;whose voice is one of the most powerfull voices i've ever heard;and it goes perfect with every single motion in their music.it is hard to say if comailes is better or worse then their previous albums;because althought the roots are the same;the style has changed. <br />Their music;which used to have the characteristics like long tracks,repeating,slower and harder melodies leave it to fast, energic tracks with more clear and memorable melodies,and more positive lyrics(yet it still preserves it's dark mood) <br /> <br />Among all those energic tracks of Comalies;the album lacks a good nice ballad;which the band has forgotten since their first and i guess only ballad \\"falling\\" from their self titled album. <br />Falling was one of the best and darkest songs i've ever heard; it made me cry for hours when i first heard it.Then,they've made a cover,a rock version of the song;falling again;which was also good but lacked the touching effects of \\"falling.\\"since then,i looked out for another Lacuna coil ballad in every album but they never did as far as i know,and they dont have any in comalies;which is the only possible negative thing i can say about this great,ground shaking rock album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005QK5X|5.0|So... the Wipers.  I'm almost tempted to repeat the obvious - who they influenced, the sad lack of publicity for this work - but I won't. <br />Instead, what I will say is that this album may be one of the most incredible rock albums you can purchase.  It's pure - the guitar is crisp and direct, the rhythm section is unbendingly solid, and the singing is more or less ideal for the tone of the songs.  This is rock and roll distilled down to it's basic elements. <br />Admittedly, it's hard to get the first few spins.  One is simply not used to hearing music like this.  But, like similar discs - Raw Power by Iggy and the Stooges is the only one that immediately comes to mind - it grows on a person. <br />The Wipers have created an almost unique piece of work - the alienation of modern man fused with the primal energy of music.  It's fascinating to listen to. <br />I would include Greg Sage on any list of great guitarists.
B000062YAZ|5.0|First up, for all of the people complaining about the intense graphic lyrical content of this album,you need to chill out. If you think it's so horrible,why did you waste time reviewing it? This is Slayer,not Frank Sinatra for f**k's sake,it's not like they are at your house forcing you to listen to it. <br /> <br />Anyway,this is probably the most violent work of music ever crafted,nothing even comes (or ever will) close to this in terms of brutality IMHO, this is the Mike Tyson of thrash albums.I had this CD along time ago when i was a freshman in highschool and listened to it on a almost everyday basis.I lent it to a freind one day and the next time i saw it, it was in two pieces because the f**ker accidentaly broke it, i was pissed.Needless to say my next copy stayed with me all the time.While this is great, i would not call this Slayers best album like many have here, i belive that honor falls in the lap of Seasons in the Abyss.There is no need to go over songs here because you know them already, this expanded edition is nifty and has nice packaging as well as two bonus tracks (which i really do not care for that much).I never was that into Slayer much and not really a fan, but i have always liked this album for some reason. King and Hanneman blaze all over this record, sometimes their soloing seems out of control and chaotic,but it all lends to the madcap craziness i guess. The drummer, Dave Lombardo, has some of the fastest drumming ever here and his bass drums are running at warp 10.Tom, while not the greatest singer, fits this kind of music perfect with his voice, though his bass is pretty much inaudible.The mix wasn't half bad either. <br /> <br /> <br />A historically important metal album and one of the most infamous as well. <br /> <br />
B00001PE4D|5.0|Upon reading many reviews of this phenomenal film, I came to find that the major complaint is that it is not realistic among other things. Come on! Really- is everyone that infatuated with reality? One would assume that reality is not enjoyable at times, which brings me to my next point. Life is not always happy go-lucky. There are problems sometimes, but if you must have an uneventful plot with no complications and a perfect ending, then I really recommend that you see a shallow movie and skip on Cruel Intentions. But enough rambling- to the technical stuff. I thought Gellar's performance was stellar. Her portrayal of Katherine made the movie in my opinion. Phillipe is just amazingly gorgeous and he's a great actor, too, which helps. Witherspoon and Blair did wonderful jobs with their characters as well. The story of Cruel Intentions is a change from most of today's romances and strays from normality. (That's a good thing) Also, the script was terrific; VERY well written. In conclusion, if you are looking for an outstanding movie that you will not soon forget, Cruel Intentions is your best choice... ENJOY.
B00000263T|5.0|After listening to this album for so long i finally got a chance to review this wicked work of metal goodness. <br /> <br />Metal Heart was Accept's 6th album and probably the slickest effort they ever released.For the first time Accept were getting a taste of superstardom that another german band,The Scorpions, had already been enjoying for a number of years now. Metal Heart saw Accept as headliners for the first time ever and were now argueably the best metal band in the 85-86 time period.You can talk all you want about Iron Maiden,Judas Preist,Dio-whatever about being the top metal acts of the 80's, but to me these guys were by-far the greatest heavy metal group of the 1980's.I seriously doubt that any band at the time had the virtous skills that these krauts possesed, Wolf Hoffman could of made Murray and Smith (of Maiden) sound poor.Stephan Kauffmann was the fastest metal drumer prior to Dave Lombardo of Slayer. And of course Udo's singing was something i have always loved. <br /> <br />Metal Heart is a fine choice if you are gonna start with on of Accept's albums.It is a commercial one for sure but i feel it is probably the best album they ever made. The title track alone is worth the price of this album,the song Metal Heart has a riff that chuggs along like a panzer.There is also the inexcapable dance metal of MidNightMover.It is important to know that this came out in the prime of the MTV hair metal age, so the move towards commercial metal was to be expected but this was still heavier then anything else being released at the time by those pathetic american pop metal groups. <br /> <br />MetalHeart 10/10, the opening track is one of the heaviest songs they ever wrote,very classicaly influenced and prophetic lyrics about mankinds future.  <br /> <br />MidNightMover 10/10, the grooviest track on the album. It was a hit single and it got a video that made you puke from being dizzy. <br /> <br />Up to the Limit 10/7, an average song by Accept standards that is still pretty good. <br /> <br />Wrong is Right 10/11, WOW! this is the fastest song on the album! Udo's bloodcurdling scream kicks it off and it is the closest song to being almost thrash in structer. <br /> <br />Screaming for a Love-bite, 10/9 a infectious song with weird lyrics. <br /> <br />Too High to Get it Right, 10/6 This sounds just a little too much like AC/DC for my taste. <br /> <br />Dogs on Leads, 10/8 a very good song with a slow moody build up that turns into a flat out anthemic rocker. <br /> <br />Teach us to Survive 10/8 not a bad song at all, has some interesting toe tapping beats and the bass gets funky at times. <br /> <br />Livin for Tonight 10/10 Awesome song, it sounds like the Scorpions Big City Nights. It is a strait out @ss kicker with some raspy vocals courtesy of the Tank. <br /> <br />Bound to Fail 10/10 the last song on the album goes out with a bang. From the killer street gang chants in the background to Hoffmanns amazing solo, this is one of the stongest songs on here and a perfect way to close a perfect album. <br /> <br />Accept doesn't get much credit and that is a shame, not many people know about them. It's been twenty years almost since this was released, so why not go pick it up and discover a true metal classic? Accept have also recenty reunited, so that should be a very welcomed reunion indeed. In this age of Linkin park, Slipknot, Jessica Simpson, Black Eyed Peas, Ipods and countless other trendy crap that pollutes the braindead masses, i think this world needs an Accept reunion and tour. <br /> <br />We are glad to have The Tank and his soilders back once again to crush the opposition. <br /> <br />Peace out.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah doesn't have a voice..it's more of a dog whistle. This is the most desperate attempt at an artist's wanting to become \\"relevant\\" again since Michael Jackson's \\"Invincible.\\" Mariah employs a rapper for almost every single song. In most of the numbers, she screams like a sexually repressed alley cat. The only good song is \\"Fantasy.\\" Other than that, stay away from the album.
0316666343|4.0|Before reading this book my friends warned me that the main action happens within the first few pages. I was weary that what would follow might be boring and hold no excitement. However after reading The Lovely Bones I understand why Alice Sebold told the story of Susie Salmon's rape and murder in the beginning of the novel. Her book is about an interpretation of heaven and of the lives of the survivors. The excitement for me soon became how each member of Susie's family would move on and grow as a person. Her sister, Lindsay, was struggling to find her own identity. Buckley, Susie's little brother kept asking where his sister was and only years later was able to understand.  Her father Jack continuously saw signs from his daughter and clues leading him to the murder suspect; all of which drove him mad and frustrated. And finally Abigail, Susie's mother, who moved away and had an affair in her own attempts to cope with the loss of her daughter. In Susie's heaven she is granted a desire to be able to view the lives of those she loved and try her best to experience what could have happened had she been alive. While the climax may occur at the beginning of the novel, I suggest reading on to experience a different perspective on life and death, as well as a side not often explored in most novels.
B000089CJI|2.0|the singing is too horribly imperfect, it destroys the otherwise beautiful album. go buy light yourself on fire by stars. It's very similair, but they can sing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's modest success over the years has failed to find them a real niche in the mainstream market, as their albums only seemed to range from Quite Good (Dookie, Nimrod) to Horrendous (Shenanigans, Warning). However, when all looked lost for the California trio, a little bit of carelessness from their recording crew led to one of the true masterpieces of last year. <br />  <br />The band, which comprise Billy Joe (singer/guitarist), Mike Dirnt (Bass) and Tre Cool (drums) were in full swing and on the verge of completing an album, full of the short, catchy riffs and meaningless but likeable lyrics that their fans had been accustomed to, when they suddenly realised that their entire cache of new tracks had been wiped out. The group failed to find the motivation to re-record the tracks, instead deciding to direct their anger at their 'elected' government. The move payed off, and American Idiot was born. <br />  <br />The title track, which will seem familiar to fans of their older material (but with more aggression and superior guitar work), spent three weeks at numebr one in the UK charts...wait, my mistake. It was one week at number three. Still, that was more than enough to get the ball rolling. The following week, the album was released, and went straight to the top of the chart. This song was overshadowed by their second single, Boulevard Of broken Dreams, a brilliant down-tempo ballad, which spent six weeks in the top ten, and more than four months in total in the charts. <br />  <br />But it's the band's third single, Holiday (ironically, the least successful of the three - it missed out on the top ten by a whisker), that really stands out. The song is astonishingly angst-ridden, with a phenominal melody that is unforgettable. It's a joy to listen to - and it's the best thing that Green Day have ever done. <br />  <br />It doesn't even matter that the two 'epic' tracks (two tracks that consist of five different parts each) are tediously long, because just when you're hoping for it to end, it pulls you back in with a new tempo or a key change. It doesn't even matter that their are several songs that recycle the same lyrics - about three other songs mention the Jesus Of Suburbia, and at least one other song uses the line \\"Don't Want To Be An American Idiot.\\" Because, when push comes to shove, tracks like St. Jimmy, Give Me Novocaine, and Leterbomb are all as good as the singles. <br />  <br />With that in mind, buy it, listen to it, then listen to it again. And never look back.
0972169504|5.0|This comic strip presents a very realistic (and very funny) perspective of graduate student life.  Several archetypes are followed: the grad student who has been there since the dawn of time and his ever-pregnant wife, the wishy-washy grad student, the female grad student who can't get a date, the first-years, and the token humanities grad student.  All are drawn and written to a T.  Although the humor will be apparant to anyone who reads it, the biting observations will ring especially true to anyone whose gone through the graduate student process.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Sea change by Beck was really the same as it's title. A turn in the tides. While writing puns on the name, we might as well compare it to H2O. Take other Beck songs based on his acoustic entity. Cold Brains,  Lazy Flies,  Nobody's Fault But My Own,  Pay No Mind (Snoozer) were lakes or fancy decorated ponds, this was a full fledge S.E.A. A enormous body of water with more salt than Utah or fast food businesses combined. Mostly when Beck straps on his acoustic *(insert folic symbol here)* his music strips down a bit as he takes away the beats, strange noises, and random vulgarity. Yet this time around he inserted so much more into this album. This would be his slowest, adamant, and depressive album Beck has wandered into. Opener  The Golden Age gives you the feeling there's hope in the fact your pain cant last forever. It may not, but it does threw-out the whole album. Paper Tiger, Lonesome Tears, Lost Cause, It's All In Your Mind, and Already Dead are a ladder into the hemorrhage inside the world Beck makes this record into. The loss of hope, of life, of love grows with each song as a cancer. Leading to (my personal favorite) the last two songs. Little One a soft picked then slowly dieing and gasping for breath strummed out chorus shows you where all things lead. To the end of the album, the end of the sea, to the river sticks, past the gate, into darkness. The only down fall of this album is astatically pleasing as it is, some songs still drag on a little (but are all amazing) leaving the album not hitting the catchiness of previous acoustic songs. That is NOT WHAT MAKES ALBUM THOUGH.......I don't know..... If you need beats and grooves that please the soul give this a 3 1/2 to 4 stars. If you need to heal the tortured soul, give this 4 1/2 to 5 star. Insert your own rating here based on above chart __________.
0670033375|3.0|This book has more pages than content.  I found parts of it interesting, but they eventually became repetitious, tiresome, and preachy.  The author feels that mankind tends to excess, is shortsighted, and has a poor concept of the future (except for himself, of course).  This is hardly news to anyone over the age of thirty.  If the author were truly concerned about deforestation, he would have made his point in half as many pages.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem has never done a better CD, by my point of view. Anyone that hasn't heard any songs from this CD or any Eminem songs, should listen to some.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This one of Mariah's best music compilations.  It's a nice blend of R & B ballad, hip hop, dance tracks with a little contemporary gospel thrown in for good measure.  This new CD showcases her amazing vocal range.  Make no mistake:  Mariah is an excellent vocalist.  Think Minnie Ripperton.  She's one of the best in the industry. <br /> <br />Mariah Carey was the top selling female artist in the 90's for good reason.  She has real talent.  The one star ratings are bogus! <br /> <br />Best cuts: We Belong Together, Mine Again, Shake if Off, Say Somethin' <br /> <br />Peace.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  From the first track, \\"It's Like That,\\" to the very last track, \\"Fly Like a Bird,\\" you are hooked.  Every track brings something fresh and new to both the album and Mariah Carey as an artist.  If you were ever a Mariah fan, this is one album you need to take a listen to.  This album lacks the whispery, airy, singing that made the last few albums infamous.  Instead, we see \\"the return of the voice\\" as advertised all over the media. <br /> <br />Beat driven and club ready, this album brings to the table what no other Mariah Carey album has done before.  This is a very upbeat album, that makes you want to get up and dance.  You'll have songs like, \\"Shake it Off,\\" \\"Say Somethin' Ft. Snoop Dogg,\\"  \\"To the Floor ft. Nelly,\\" \\"Get Your Number ft. Jermain Dupri\\" (in which J.D. sounds more like Nelly than Nelly does on \\"To the Floor\\") and even \\"Stay the Night\\" making you want to hit the dance floor.  Even the ballads in this album are upbeat when compared to some of her traditional ballads like \\"Hero\\" or \\"I Don't Wanna Cry.\\" <br /> <br />This album mixes urban, with 70's classics, and classic Mariah.  Songs like \\"One and Only\\" featuring Twista, \\"We Belong Together,\\" and \\"Your Girl\\" definitely showcase it's urban sound, while ballads like \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\"I Wish You Knew\\" are reminiscent of such great 70's divas as Chaka Khan and Diana Ross.  Especially in \\"I Wish You Knew\\" which recreates those moments often found in live Diana Ross recordings where she stops and talks to the audience.  \\"I don't know if anyone else out there tonight knows what it feels like... to want somebody so bad... that nothing... and nobody... can ever seem to fill that void.  But that's the situation that I'm talking about right now.  And if you feel me, sing the song with me.  Come on.\\" She explains towards the end of the song.  But do not get me wrong, these songs are undeniably Mariah Carey songs.  Everything that made a Mariah Carey song a \\"Mariah Carey\\" song is still present. <br /> <br />This album marks a change and maturity for Mariah as an artist.  Not a change that should shock any of her fans, new school or old school.  Rather, one that seems like a natural progression.  The next step for Mariah Carey after the success of Butterfly.  Except that it came three albums after it probably should have.  Her voice, strong as it ever was and used as it always should be, is definitely back, and so is she.  This, and not Charmbracelet, is definitely her come back album.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah was good in her prime. Soon, she started to become \\"black\\" when she is more white than a ghost. On this album, she lines herself up with every rapper in the universe and still manages to sing off-key and sing bad lyrics. \\"We Belong Together\\" is the only good song on this album. To all the \\"lambs\\" out there: sorry! Going to J-Lo's or Madonna's forums to post bad stuff can't take away from Mariah's downfall.
B00005JN8Z|4.0|...these were the parting words of the notorious Roman emperor Nero as he comitted suicide at the age of 30 in 68 A.D. Mervyn LeRoy's 1951 adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz' famous book is one of the more memorable biblical epics of the 1950s and 1960s brought to life most of all by the brilliant performance of Peter Ustinov (Lentulus the lanista in Spartacus) as the Roman emperor, Nero. The film follows the trials and tribulations of Lygia (Deborah Kerr), a convert to the new faith of Christianity in Nero's pagan Rome. The Christians are now the targets of persecutions and a centurion named Marcus Vicinius (Taylor) is sent to spy on the sect by his emperor. Marcus Vicinius falls in love with Lygia, converts, and is soon marked for death. The film follows his ordeal and those of his Christian brethren.     This is a good biblical film that's well paced and supported by good acting talent. Although a little too old for the part, Peter Ustinov steals the show in his role as the art-loving but tone-deaf emperor who, according to legend, set Rome afire and watched it burn so as to play his lyre while reciting the Iliad; the emperor who blamed the Christian cult for the fire and persecuted its followers by throwing them to the beasts or using them as human torches to light the streets of Rome. The film unfortunately propagates many of the common distortions about Nero as a person. Although Nero was certainly a despot who saw Christians as anarchists, most of the anecdotal stories about him being stupid, unpopular, and without talent have been shown to be false. Nero was quite intelligent and very energetic in his pursuit of the arts: there's good evidence that he was a talented lyre player and an average/above average singer. Nero was a master propagandist who was very well loved throughout the empire: particularly in Greece and Asia Minor where, after his death, several impostors acquired siginificant followings in their attempts to claim the throne. Actually, Nero remained a popular folk hero in antiquity (even among some Christians strangely enough) for over 400 years. Regardless of its propagation of the stereotypical image of a half-witted and artistically challenged Nero, this film is one of the best Roman-biblical films of that period and it isn't excessively dogmatic: it has something to offer for everyone. I strongly recommend it.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|My wife and I rented this from Hollywood Video for the listed cast which looked excellent and the description on the back cover as \\"Romantic Drama\\". This was not romantic at all. It was filled with excessive vulgar language, and voicing explicit sexual acts. The acting was poor as the casts discomfort with the script showed it as forkful dialogue. The story line was confusing, choppy, and pointless. In end, the movie leaves you with nothing to say.  <br />It appears that the director was smoking crack when this was made. Don't bother seeing it unless you want to go through the pain. When I returned the movie to Hollywood Video, I made sure that I spoke to the manager to tell him \\"This was absolute crap!\\" <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|If you're looking for a good, catchy, smooth, contemporary R&B album, then this is the one for you. Mariah highlights her stunning voice on every single track. To be honest, I like her vocals on this better than any of her other albums including her debut. She's matured more and it shows. Mariah can use her voice anyway she likes and get the desired effect. I think this CD is impressive. Not impressive because it's a \\"comeback,\\" but it's just impressive by any standard. She's always been operating on another level and she demonstrates that once again. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is quickly becoming my favorite Mariah Carey album. It's more interesting, more complete. I think this is the album that represents her as a person and recording artist the best. <br /> <br />Favorites: <br />We Belong Together <br />Mine Again <br />Stay The Night <br />Get Your Number <br />One And Only <br />Joy Ride <br />Fly Like A Bird <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|An interesting album... Very good though.

B000063DIH|3.0|First off, I love Iron Maiden and they have been my favorite group since the Number of The Beast came out.  My 3 star rating is compared to the other albums Maiden has completed.  It is an indication of both what I love about the item and what I hate about it.   <br /> <br />I remember when Fear of The Dark first came out.  As a long time Maiden fan, you got the feeling things were a little different on this album.  It has great songs such as Be Quick Or Be Dead, Fear of The Dark, Afraid To Shoot Strangers and Judas Be My Guide.  But, unlike other Maiden albums, this one was also filled with some forgettable tunes such as, Chains of Misery and Fugitive. I guess it was only a matter of time.  Everybody needs a break.  But, don't get me wrong, Fear of The Dark has some true Maiden classics that will live forever.   The song Fear of The Dark is amazing and clearly demonstrates why Maiden is the greatest band of all time.  Afraid To Shoot Strangers has both that classic sound, but if you listen carefully there are hints of what is to come in the future as Harris and gang began to really progress musically.   <br /> <br />In short, its a decent album, the first half totaly rocks and second half with the exception of Judas Be My Guide and Fear of The Dark, is forgettable.  As a band whose albums tend to run 8 songs normally anyway, with Fear of The Dark,Maiden should have stayed with that formula. <br /> <br />1. Be Quick or Be Dead - 6 out of 10 stars... basically its a good song, not a true Maiden classic however <br />  <br />2. From Here to Eternity - 6 out of 10 stars... another good song, the video is awsome, but one of those songs you normally do not mention as a Maiden classic <br /> <br />3. Afraid to Shoot Strangers - 10 out of 10 stars... amazing song that encompases both the classic Maiden sound but also provides a glimpse into the future on later albums <br />  <br />4. Fear Is the Key - 5 out of 10 stars... its alright, nothing to get excited about though <br /> <br />5. Childhood's End - 4 out of 10 stars... some people like this song, I however was dissapointed with it and I rarely play it... <br />  <br />6. Wasting Love - 7 out of 10 stars... A ballad??? even the video screams ballad... WTF!!! Strangely, while it is not really Maiden as we know them, it is pretty good... but really WTF!!! <br />  <br />7. Fugitive - 2 out of 10 stars - simply put, forgettable <br />  <br />8. Chains of Misery - 2 out of 10 starts - another forgettable song <br /> <br />9. Apparition - 3 out of 10 stars - this demonstrates what I mean by should have stuck to the 8 song per album formula... a forgettable tune that never gels <br />  <br />10. Judas Be My Guide - 8 out of 10 stars... finally, after 3 forgettable songs you get Judas Be My Guide.  Not normally at the top of people's list, but it is a catchy tune that reminds me a little of the Somewhere In Time album... <br />  <br />11. Weekend Warrior - 5 out of 10 stars... I dont hate it... don't love it either... but generally not one I typically listen too... close to being a forgettable song <br />  <br />12. Fear of the Dark - 10 out of 10 stars... a TRUE MAIDEN CLASSIC!!!  This song is by far the best one they had in several years (at the time the album came out).  This song really drags you into Maiden's world.  I LOVE IT!!! <br /> <br />Up the Irons!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I'm an avid metal fan. I listen to ALOT of heavy metal. I can tell you right now, this band is NOT real heavy metal. It's shock value and nothing more. Don't believe me? Count how many times they say F**K in one song, and how they sing about raping dead corpses, all while wearing their crazy and &quot;scary&quot; masks so that everyone will think they're &quot;hardkore&quot;. When you get down to the bare bones of it, Slipknot is doing nothing more then feeding off of shock value, just like alot of other games, moves, and bands I could think of. If you really do want good metal, check out these bands, for they actually have talent.<BR>Lamb of God<BR>Immortal<BR>Into Eternity<BR>Dark Tranquility<br />I hope this has been helpful to you.<BR>P.S. The bands I listed you have probably never heard of, because they don't shove their music videos and products down your throat.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I absolutley love The Emancipation of Mimi. It's Mariah's best since Butterfly. This album has a lil bit for everyone from ballads to club tracks. Don't listen to those haters dissing the cd they are lame losers. My favorite songs are as follows, We Belong Togther, Mine Again, Stay The Night, One and Only, Circles, Your Girl, Joy Ride, and Fly Like a Bird. If you don't have this cd it's a must have. Move over J-lo and Beyonce' Mimi is back!!
B0007Y4USW|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi is Mariah Carey's best album by far.  Her voice is right on track with all the up beat songs (It's Like that and To The Floor).  Plus, she has her all impressive ballads as well (We Belong Together and Stay The Night).  I highly recommend this album for anyone who has ever been a Mariah fan and for those who doubt her talent.  This album will make everyone a fan and a believer of Mariah that this is her come back album.
B00005RHF8|1.0|I first saw this movie when I was in high school - over 30 years ago.  A hopeless romantic, I fell in love with this version.  I was so excited when I found it on DVD.  Imagine the horror as I watched a hacked, edited, and chopped up edition of what was a beautiful film.  Save your money for the version with Timothy Dalton.  This one is a total waste!
B00005JNRB|3.0|I would have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's book of the same title. Being a big fan of Crussler, I have to say that Matthew McConaughy doesn't fit the profile of Dirk Pitt, not even close. Having said that, I can't say this casting chocie was a mismatch since McConaughy actually does a pretty decent job here. Simply put, he's not Dirk Pitt of the Clive Crussler novels but Dirk Pitt created by Hollywood.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining and fast pace action film. Most people would called this a great \\"popcorn flick\\". The plot is far-fetched as humanly possible so there really nothing on film to take seriously. William H. Macy plays Admiral Sandecker, a surprised but pleasant choice and he does a good job playing a \\"boss\\" figure for once. Steve Zahn provides the comic relief and poor Penelope Cruz was totally miscast in her role. Its also embarassing that her limitation as an actress was totally revealed in a \\"popcorn flick\\" of all things. But she was nice to look at and in a movie like this, that is what most people really care about. (That may sound bit chauvinist but its the sad Hollywood truth. After all, they could have easily hire Emma Thompson instead but for obvious reason, they did not.)<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie and if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's novel and characters, it would have received an another star. (I wonder what Mr. Crussler think about this movie??)
B00005UOXN|2.0|I can't say that this release, despite it's popularity is one to be taken too seriously.  While it's sometimes slick remixes and extended versions of old tracks make for an interesting listen, they bring little new out in these classic songs to make anyone hooked for more than a moment.  By dance standards, these songs aren't as hot as one might think and by rock and roll standards they come across as watered down in this setting. <br /> <br />If you're a huge Billy Idol fan I'd get this...but it's not the casual listener.
B00000099Y|5.0|First time I saw this CD case on the store and buy it weeks after under recomendation of a friend, he doesnt know but that purchase make me a absolute Tool fan, the CD was so different than anything you can listen on the market on thouse days (97) that was hard to listen and apresiate the genius in that bottle, after a few days of lisening this cd I became aware of the Masterpiece that was before my ears. <br />And I wanted more and went back to the store and purchase the Undertow (another masterpiece), and waited for the Lateralus, for almost 5 years and the wait was whorthy. <br />I recently purchased the Opiate and that is an AMAZING kick in to your ears ass CD. <br />After listen to almost all the Tool discography I can say that the AEnima is on of the best (if not the best) albumns of the band, exelent lyrics, full of anger, hate and love, unique song structures that will make you re-discover the deep of this album. <br />Highly recomended, if you are just a bit in to Heavy Metal stuff and didnt have this CD, go to the store and give it a try and Im shure in a month or less you will be in the same store asking for more TOOL.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Can't believe some of the reviews I've been reading. How can you say that Mariah can't sing, that's just pure hate. Her vocals shine through on this one. Mariah proves why she is a living legend on this CD! GREAT VOCALS! <br /> <br />so much better than that Sorry \\"FIRST LADY\\" from Faith Evans.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This band woulnd be metal if their life depended on it. They truly sound like crap, specialy that whiny p*ssy Corey-- he's without a question a f*ggot... Anyways, from the first track to the last? Its pretty much boooring!! Slipknot's \\" vol 3:(the subliminal verses)\\" is an example of weakness and how mediocre a band can be truly be, without even wanting to...Don't waste your money on this poser nu-metal p*ssy bullsh*t.
0671027344|4.0|This book, I thought, was an insight to the mind of a high school sutdent that not a lot of people would ever think of happening to a young adult.  There are many things that happen to Charlie during the book, and at some points may seem extreme.  For example, he is introduced to pot, sex and alcohol.  At the beginning of the book he is introduced to having to deal with death because one of his friends dies, right in the first year of highschool.  This book, I would say is a book in which I would recommend parents to read because sometimes they think these things would never happen to their child, however, these our problems high school students deal with everyday.  Also, Charlie's sister has an abusive boyfriend and Charlie has to learn whether he believes this is right or wrong.  The reason he doesn't jump to the conclusion of this being wrong, is because his sister tells him not to say anything and tries to come off as happy with her boyfriend.  However, this gets to Charlie, he can't deal with it and speaks up about it; his sister is furious, and again Charlie now how has to deal with his sister \\"hating\\" because he opened his mouth.  I really enjoyed this book and thought, not only did it help me understand what the majority of high school students go through, but it also made me see how different people deal with different subjects of life.  After reading this book I wish I could have met Charlie and asked him so many questions, but since I can't do that, I will have to take what I got out of the book and go with it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was one of the first anime movies i ever watched.  My friend and i had just discovered anime, and were looking for something we would enjoy.  When an employee at the video store recomended Princss Mononoke, we rented it. <br />  That night we watched it and both fell in love woth the plot, the characters and the animation.  We then watched it twice the next day.  This movie is addicting and one of the best i've ever seen.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Danvers State Mental Hospital has stood empty for 15 years, after being shut down in 1985 due to scandal and budget cuts. Now it is a gigantic labyrinth (about the size of a small town) of moldering hallways, rooms, and offices. Built in 1871, Danvers is also a toxic hazard, full of asbestos floor tiles and crocolodite ceiling panels. Enter the Hazmat Elimination Co., the team that just outbid the competition by claiming to be able to do the clean-up job in a week, instead of the normal, more rational 3 week period. Gordon is Hazmat's boss, and he needs the money. You see, something terrible has just happened in his life that we are only given tiny clues and glimpses of before the true terror unfolds. Phil (David Caruso) has worked for Hazmat a long time and fears that Gordon may be wading slowly into the deep end. The rest of the crew includes Hank, a goof-off with a gift for sarcasm, Jeff, who is Gordon's nephew and has a serious case of nichtophobia (yep, he's afraid of the dark), and Mike, a law student with a calm nature and quite possibly the group's only brain. Danvers unleashes it's horror like a time-release capsule of dread, effecting these men in small ways, building up in them like the toxic dust they certainly must be breathing. Beneath it's silence and peeling paint, Danvers is a repository of the evils that transpired within it's walls. Hank stumbles upon a near fortune in old coins, glasses, and gold and silver teeth hidden in the bricks. It is when he returns alone by night, set on taking his treasure and leaving the state, that the real malevolence of Danvers shows it's shadow-covered face. Meanwhile, Mike has found a box full of session tapes for patient Mary Hobbes, that turn out to be the largest piece we'll get to the puzzle of Danvers Mental Hospital. SESSION 9 is an overlooked classic of mounting tension and invisible hauntings. Don't expect CGI boogeymen or cheap \\"jump\\" scenes every two minutes, this is a creeper that delivers it's jolts andshudders over time, making us squirm uncomfortably through the whole bloody thing! Come, visit Danvers, and you'll see what I mean. Highly recommended...

B00005JMFQ|4.0|Yes, the old saying is true, love is all around us. There is no real chance anyone has of escaping its effects as best we try sometimes. For as simple an act as falling in love may seem, falling out of love or moving on after lover lost is never quite as easy a thing to actually carry out. It is never a gracious thing to go through life believing what our mothers had always told us, that there would be someone out there for every one of us, especially when you have nothing with you now to show for it. As hard as we might try, it is practically impossible when we are alone to prevent our minds from racing with the thoughts of \\"what if I never find that special someone\\". There is always tomorrow, you tell yourself day in and day out as the weeks and months slip slowly by like tiny grains of sand through a timer, wondering within your subconscious how long you can keep this act up of fooling yourself with such nonsense. Depression inevitably sinks in as life pitches you the perfect no-hitter in the field of relationships, knocking you about as if you were the universe's personal whore. All around you see couples holding each other's hands and clinging tight to their loved ones while you travel the seemingly desolate sidewalks alone and downtrodden. If love is as chaotic as everyone makes it out to be, why is it that we find ourselves returning to it time and again despite the afflictive lessons of the past? Love is simply a natural occurrence, instinctive really, and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to control those feelings you have for someone close and dear to you, even if they may not know it just yet. Love, when lost or unrequited, can truly be dispiriting, but once you are able to get back on that horse it can be the most completely fulfilling experience of your life and no one should prevent themselves from embracing it head on. <br /> <br />The story is a mingled interweaving of several individual storylines, all of which involve the enchanting, if not often perplexing, subject of love written by Richard Curtis, the man behind such romantic comedies as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary. With just five weeks left until Christmas, London, England is abuzz with men and women sorting out their love lives, or lack of them. The film begins with David, the recently elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who, not even seconds into the door of his new home, has fallen deeply in love with his catering manager Natalie, recently dumped by her ex-boyfriend who complained of her being \\"too fat\\". David's younger sister Karen attempts to juggle a crippling relationship with her husband, Harry, the operator of a local magazine, who has become quite friendly with his flirtatious secretary Mia, and helping her friend Daniel cope with the recent passing of his wife. While attempting to move on with his life, Daniel must also help navigate his eleven year old son through a situation of his own, having fallen in love with an American girl who happens to be the most popular girl at school. Karen is also friends with Jamie Bennett, a novelist who has temporarily relocated to France to nurse his broken heart after discovering his girlfriend cheating on him with his much younger and more attractive brother, only to be captivated by Aurelia, the Portuguese housekeeper of his country villa. Harry's best editor Sarah is absolute smitten by Karl, a fellow magazine editor, and has been ever since she started working at the magazine over a year ago but has not had the courage to tell him how she has felt and complications with her brother, who is currently in the asylum, has not made her personal life any easier. Juliet has just married Peter not realizing that his best friend Mark, the photographer, has been infatuated with her ever since they first met, though he has never spoken a word of this to anyone, let alone herself. Colin Frissell, a lascivious waiter at Peter and Juliet's wedding reception,unable to connect with British women decides to travel to the states, specifically Wisconsin, to score with a bunch of American girls relying solely on his \\"British charm\\". And burnt-out former British rock-icon Billy Mack, desperate for a comeback to the top of the charts after overcoming a long standing heroin addiction, acts as the main connection for all these individual love-lines.  <br /> <br />The story for Love Actually is almost as complicated a matter, ironically, as the concept of love itself. In order to find all the connections between the characters and understand the unfolding of events within the framework of the picture one must truly pay attention throughout the interwoven storylines but it is not as complicated a concept as it would seem. We connect with the characters and their actions on screen almost instantaneously because we, as individuals, see ourselves and our own lovelorn, often foolish, actions paraded in front of us on screen. Having experienced at least one, if not more, of the complex love stories in our own lives, we are at long last able to see our own actions for ourselves and are able to gain a fresh perspective and a far better understanding of those events, thus putting our minds, and perhaps even our souls, at ease for it. <br /> <br />Colin Firth works splendidly as Jamie Bennett, a man so desperate to escape the pangs of lost love that he flees the country to concentrate on his novel only to fall in love once again with a charming woman who doesn't speak a word of English. This just goes to show that love is both blind and strong and it can not be deterred by the mere language barriers that have separated us in so many other functions of human interaction throughout the world. It would have been more appropriate for the filmmakers to have taken Liam Neeson's Daniel a little more serious - the events at the funeral were not offensive given the context but they did seem a tad bit out place considering it was a funeral after all- being how he lost his wife but this is a comedy and it was expected for them not to dwell too longingly on the rather serious subject matter. The deteriorating relationship between Karen and Harry, played eloquently by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman respectfully, on other hand, was handled as it should have been allowing the audience to contemplate in their head the events, not always in consecutive order, that can lead to love loss in a relationship to love found in another and how everyone in that triangle is affected by it. The most charming scene in the entire film has to be when Mark, played with such effort by Andrew Lincoln, visits Juliet on Christmas Eve and tells her, silently via the use of cue-cards (clever) and carol music, how he has always felt about her but never bucked up the courage to tell her until now. Often, when we lose someone close to our heart to another man or woman, quite possibly forever, we instinctively want to shut out those feelings we once had for that person and attempt to move on with our lives as best we can but never seems to work out. We, as human beings, need closure with any close relationship we have in our lives, whether it involves family, friends, or loves, and we can never fully move on until we let our feelings be known to that person. It is better for us to act upon those feelings then to hold them in, worrying ourselves to death with the thought of \\"had she/he but known\\", even if nothing is to come about as a result of this forthrightness, as this particular scenes demonstrates. Then and only then can we be one within our mind once again, telling ourselves \\"enough\\" and having the ability now to move on fully with our life. Billy Bob Thornton makes a cheap cameo in the role of the President of the United States. Though his slick southern persona and entirely unlikable womanizing style, eerily renascent of William Jefferson Clinton, are worth a few laughs, he contributes practically nothing to the storyline and couldhave easily been downplayed or excluded from the film altogether. Originally Rowan Atkinson's character, Rufus, the jewelry department salesman, was supposed to be an angel and would have disappeared after passing Daniel in the airport near the end of the film, which would have done a better job in clearing up his involvement in both Harry's and Daniel's son's relationships but as it stands it works out fine. <br /> <br />Overall, critics may complain about Love Actually's uniquely over-the-top nature and its ability to be so overtly clichd even for its own good but, in actuality, often love is like that sometimes - it is never as spontaneous or original as we would want it to be but it retains its charm and effective none the less, which goes hand-in-hand with this film and enduring message. Despite creating a distinctively potent and dazzling directorial debut, there are several aspects to the film that failed to pan out properly for Richard Curtis. For example, though come-back rocker Billy Mack does tie all the loose coalition of storylines together and ultimately lends help to the charming, if not overtly clichd, ending involving Daniel's son and the love of his life at the airport, his own storyline on the other hand feels flat and uninteresting. Either his character should have been expanded or simply pushed more into the background as a mere side character instead of what is given to us here. John and Judy, the couple that meets on the set for a stimulated love scene for a motion picture, are two other supporting characters that could have been left out of the film entirely as they contribute nothing to the story at all. It is fantastic to see that Curtis wants to demonstrate love lost and found in a variety of situations but there is a point when so much becomes too much and you eventually have to cut something loose to balance the feature out again, something Curtis fails to do here. But these are comparatively minor slip-ups, as unnecessary and inconvenient to the overall storyline as they may be, and hardly leave a lasting affect on the film's clear-cut purpose and contemplative message that love is truly all we need in this world to be happy. True, the sole intention of this film was that of romantic comedy but it does not hurt to pay closer attention to the events that unfold within this feature and perhaps gain a clear understanding of a situation in our own complicated love life, one we may not have obtained else where. Love actually is all around us - all we have to do is open our eyes and see it for ourselves.
B00003CXC6|4.0|This really is a work of art, from a film-making and acting perspective, but the DVD comes up short in several areas.<br /><br />I won't get into Rashomon as a work of art, as it has been amply covered in other posts. But the \\"Criterion Collection\\" DVD itself suffers a bit in several respects: shakiness in the opening title scenes and some early shots of the temple (which I believe is the result of the film conversion process, rather than shaky camerawork) and the 1.3/1 aspect ratio. This latter is particularly irritating in the courtyard testimony scenes, when the other witnesses are cut off, but is also apparent in some of the fight scenes. And imagine how glorious those dappling-sunlight-through-the-trees scenes would have been in widescreen! A shame.<br /><br />On the other hand, the DVD extras such as the Altman commentary and interview with the cinematographer are welcome additions.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is the most brilliant movie I've ever seen.  Anyone who blames entertainment for the world's problems (i.e. Columbine) should be forced to watch this movie.  Our four heroes: Stan, the mature kid, Kyle, the smart Jewish kid, Cartman, the mean fat kid, and Kenny, the poor kid, are \\"corrupted\\" by the latest movie staring Canadians Terrance and Phillip and pretty soon, every other word coming out of their mouth is a cuss word.  Their parents, mainly Kyle's mom, get their panties in a wad over their sons' new vocabulary and prod the US gov't to wage war on Canada.  The movie shows how intolerance and scapegoating of everyone except the kids and parents themselves when kids misbehave can open a huge can of worms, and possibly start the Apocalypse.  And ironically, after the parents campaign so hard against dirty language and images, in the end, cussing saves the day.  If you are not easily offended, watch this movie.  Even if you are easily offended, watch this movie - you are exactly the audience it's message is aimed at.
B0007CNXUU|1.0|Here is the truth.  James Barrie was in his own day and in his own way almost as creepy as Michael Jackson.  Like Michael Jackson, James Barrie refused to grow up and was only really comfortable with children.   <br /> <br />The Davis family, when he met them, was not reeling from the loss of a father.  Their father was perfectly alive and became increasingly upset by the way Barrie, with his celebrity, wealth and charm, wormed himself into Davis' sons'and wife's affections.  Why the hell do you think they left the man out of the movie?  Because it would have spoiled the warm and fuzzy story they wanted to put over. <br /> <br />James Barrie never had a \\"normal\\" relationship with a woman, not even his wife who did leave him, not because he found a more meaningful relationship with Sylvia Davis but because he could never be a real husband. <br /> <br />He did end up as a guardian to the boys after the deaths of their parents but the boys, as they grew up, came to understand how intrusive Barrie had been in their lives and they resented him for it.  His influence on them was not good.  They did not regard him fondly.  He used them selfishly for his own emotional and creative purposes and they knew it. <br /> <br />Peter Pan was the result.  It is a work of genius but it has a dark side as anyone who actually reads the work can attest.  As the little boy in the movie said, it was Barrie himself who was really Peter Pan.  In the context of the movie it was supposed to be a compliment but in real life it was tragic.   <br /> <br />That one moment, however, was the closest this movie comes to the truth of the work of art that is \\"Peter Pan\\" and to the heart of its creator.  Other than that, the film is a  dishonest piece of tripe and the people who are responsible for it should be ashamed.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Funny - after I purchased this CD from Amazon, everytime I log into Amazon I get recommendations, like  \\"If you like this CD, you also might like listening to an alley cat caterwauling over rap music.\\"  Or, \\"People who ordered this CD also ordered crap.\\" <br /> <br />Personally, I take this personally.  The emancipation of mimi is her best album since Buttfly, Charmbracelet, and Thisalbumsux.  So what if J.Lo, MC, and Christina could be best defined as a musical genre, that is possibly the worst commercial non-music crap ever made.  The point is I like it - and that's my perogative (word up to you Bobby!)  The point is, I enjoy high pitched screeching, mixed in with nonsensical chanting over drum machine beats.  The point is, I like the singing style, that isn't so much \\"singing\\" as its dischordant shreiking that goes up and down the music scale, hitting as many notes in one breath, as to be the musical equivalent of a seismograph. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00061QK02|2.0|Not real funny.  I really don't have high expectations for recent cinema, but those low expectations weren't even met.  I kept expecting to laugh, looking for the jokes, waiting for it ... but nothing.  The only funny parts of the movie are the character of Brick Tamland (he just says random things, and I think they were all improvised) and the outtakes at the end.  There is one laugh regarding a prank the female newscaster plays on Ron Burgundy, but that was mostly for the shock value than actual humor content.  Jack Black comes into the movie long enough to drop-kick a dog off a bridge.  Um, okay?  Is that supposed to be funny?  I found it more disturbing than anything, and something Mr. Black should be above doing.  Oh, and there's a little dig at the Bush Administration at the end, but it was so unoriginal and unfunny as to almost be insulting.  If you're just dying to see this movie, go find the trailer and watch it.  The trailer has about all the kinda funny lines Ron Burgundy says in a convenient short form.  It'll save you a few hours of boredom.    I didn't even bother with the \\"super duper extras\\" or whatever else was on this stupid DVD.  I didn't really feel like seeing what DIDN'T make it into this movie considering all the trash that DID make it.  I just wanted to do something else with my life.    Give this one a pass.
0671027344|4.0|In the novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, the main character, Charlie finds him self experiencing situation after situation as he enters his freshmen year in high school. At the beginning of the book it becomes obvious that Charlie is not your average teen. Although he is extremeley smart and gifted when it comes to literature, he finds himself being cornered into different situations throughout the novel in which he has no idea how to respond. After befriending Sam and Patrick (both seniors in high school), he learns more about who he is and about what life is like through the eyes of  different people. Although Charlie is portrayed as an extremely passive individual, he somehow maintains a sense of care and devotion to his friends. In the end he realizes this and begins a new life as a softmore facing more new situations head on. I rated this book with four stars. At times is could get kind of boring. However, Charlie's strange relationships and experiences with his friends makes it interesting. Overall, this book gives the reader an interesting glimpse into the life of a teen.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray Charles always had the talent to put a sparkle in the eye of anyone who listened to his music, even if they weren't necessarily fans.  While this album never really sets the hairs on end, Charles's album branches across multiple genres to bring the world a loving tribute to the late blues guitarist. <br /> <br />What is most surprising is the vacancy of blues from this album.  Only \\"Sinner's Pray\\", \\"Heaven Help Us All\\", and \\"Crazy Love\\" really give any resemblance to the traditional Ray Charles, if any guitarist such as him can be considered conventional.  Getting together with Willie Nelson, Michael McDonald, Diana Krall, and others may not be a reach for him, but it creates some interesting surprises, such as his dip into musical theater music with \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\".  It works sometimes, and at others, it wreaks of a cheap lounge singer. <br /> <br />In the end, it will put a smile on the face of fans and non-fans alike, reminding us of what Ray did, and what he would be capable of if he was still alive. <br /> <br />Highs: Classic fusion of blues and gospel, while presenting new experiments with smooth jazz, motown, musical theater, and conventional pop singers. <br />Lows: Sappier than afternoon soaps at times, nothing oustanding here. <br />The Score: B-, Genius? No.  But it will draw company.

0446691437|5.0|I wish i had more than 5 stars to give this book.  it was a revelation!  before i was half way through, I was torn between finishing it and putting it down to follow its advice.  After 10 years of \\"going pro\\" as Pressfield would call it, This book was like an oasis in a desert.  It sounds so lame to say a book \\"changed my life\\" but it did, and it will change yours as well if you have known what it is to struggle with the decision to devote yourself to some \\"higher calling\\".  Besides art, I also teach sahaja yoga meditation, always a difficult subject to put into words.  I must humbly admit that I have seldom been able to connect with my students through words on these subtle themes as well as Pressfield connected with me through this book.  Don't believe the nay-sayers.  Most of the critical reviews brand Pressfield as a cynic, but I have never read a book that contained more hope.  I also noticed that alot of reviewers said \\"it was great, but...\\" The \\"but\\" being the last third of the book.  So it always is when someone approaches the truth, some will embrace it, others will run.  Pressfield was not afraid to write about the spiritual side to his artistic battles, we shouldn't reward his courage with fear.  It might not grab you like the first 2 thirds, but open your heart a little, and you will realize that the author saved the best for last.  A monumental work, and concise enough, some pages only a sentence or two, that it can be read at bedside (or eisel-side!) as a daily devotion.  It is really that substantial.  A gem, a life-saver, has to be experienced to be believed.
B000067J1H|3.0|My friend Lyle reccomended this movie to me one day during a conversation about big corporations like Starrbucks, and mass consumerism or something. He figured that this movie would somehow make me think more about that type of thing. So when it came down to it at the video store I had \\"The Fight Club\\" in one hand and \\"Bad Boys 2\\" in the other. I REALLY wanted to see Bad Boys 2 again, but as not to hurt Lyle's feelings I opted for \\"The Fight Club\\".  <br /> <br />Now judging by the name I figured it was something I could really sink my teeth into, considering how much I LOVE action in movies. Boy, was I only half right.  <br /> <br />It started out with confusing talking parts and didn't seem to go anywhere or make any sense. But man, when they made their Fight Club I suddenly tuned right in! He was like \\"Punch me as hard as you can\\" BAM! Right in the ear! Then they got more fighters and it was an all out brawl! As you can probably tell, these fight scenes were by far my favorite parts in the movie. However, there were far too many boring talking parts that were WAY over your average viewers head (even mine).  <br /> <br />So there I was, completely inspired to go out and make some action of my own, so I tried to start my own fight club, which I now kind of regret. I asked Lyle to be the honorary second member which he politely declined, so I called him a chicken, and where I come from that is NOT something you take lightly. But he ignored me anyways. I decided to make Morris my first member to fight. We just started out wrestling on the grass after I told him the rules, but I quickly stopped the fight when he tried to bite me, and it's just not fair to punch at a dog. I couldn't really blame him because dogs aren't that smart. I got frustrated so I took a direct cue from the movie and blasted our paperboy with the hose so he would fight me, but he ended up falling off his bike which somehow hurt his foot of all things. I decided it wouldn't have been a fair fight anyways. Anyways, my mom came out and started yelling at me. I told her I wasnt' allowed to talk about Fight Club, and she got really angry. When she finally went inside the house, I fought the mailbox. Then I went out back and fought her tomato garden. That was pretty much the end of the Fight Club because I got grounded shortly after this.  <br /> <br />Anyways, if I were you I would only get this DVD to fast forward to all the great fighting, skip all of the long talking parts, and all parts with the girl because they will bore you to death. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Tom Arnold is also in the movie, but he has a really big deformed chest. Whatever.  <br /> <br />In conclusion I guess I can't say I'm too proud to have tried to organize a fight club back then. I'm a couple years older now, and I guess I don't really want to fight people for real anymore. The people that make these movies may not realize it, but it can really get people like us worked up if they are trying to tell us that being in a violence gang is the way to live your life. Now, when my mom or dad or anyone else makes me mad, my new non-violent solution is to simply play my harmonica at them until my face turns red. It may sound silly, but it works and nobody gets hurt, AND it was reccommended to me by my doctor, who specializes in anger manegment.

B00000ILDE|5.0|This has got to be one of my all time favorite movies. Its a great movie and it will always be great. The story is interesting and it picks up from where alien left off but this time its war...This movies got some great creatures in it, the queen alien it one of the coolest monsters in any movie, and the aliens got a new look from the orgininal. This is also where the series ends in my mind as the next two and then avp are all bad. But just watch alien and aliens, mabye predator if you want. Even though im shure you wanna find out what happens to bishop,newt,ripley and hicks dont bother seeing three as it cannot compare to this movie and will. This is a definate buy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|While the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is great, the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy is in my opinion the greatest trilogy that has ever been made.  George Lucas' brilliance first came to the big screen in 1977 with \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\".  This movie would set the standard for all sci-fi movies that followed.  With Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Darth Vader just to name a few, \\"A New Hope\\" was universally loved.  The story continued with \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" which in my opinion was the best \\"Star Wars\\" movie ever made.  The second movie in the original trilogy puts Luke face to face with Darth Vader and includes the biggest revelation in movie history and one of the most famous lines ever.  \\"Return of the Jedi\\" concludes the original trilogy with a blast as Luke and Darth Vader face off for the last time as the Emporer watches and waits to try to turn Luke to the Dark Side as he did with Darth Vader.  This movie trilogy is one to own.
B00000I4XR|5.0|I love this movie, ive seen it about 40 or so times in my life and I will still watch it if it happens to be on amc..Even though I have it on tape. Its one of Spieldbergs better films and though its lost its horror edge its still enjoyable. Great movie to watch with friends or family. This is the best Jaws. The rest get worse and worse. Just stick to this.

0471267554|4.0|As with any \\"diet\\" book or advice, I think this one needs to be taken with a grain of salt, so to speak.   <br /> <br />Removing grains and legumes, and processed foods from the diet has proven to be highly beneficial to me.  Removing dairy is logical, since the human body is not intended to process any milk other than mother's.  Since making these adjustments to my diet, I have felt so much better, and when I occassionally have a piece of cheese, my body has difficulty processing it.  Sugar had already been removed from my diet years before I found this book. <br /> <br />However, there are a few points I do not follow.  I do not calculate the acidity and alkalinity of my diet.  That is too much bother.  I do not avoid all salt, as avoiding it altogether can cause it's own problems, as sodium is necessary in some amount.  I do not restrict myself to lean meats, as a certain amount of dietary fat is necessary for satiety.  I do not avoid vinegars or oils.   <br /> <br />I use sea salt, rather than iodized salt, as it is less processed.  I have changed my oil selections, in part from his recommendations, and in part from others, but I now use olive, grapeseed, coconut, and nut oils (not peanut, which is a legume), rather than soybean or canola.  I eat a healthy balance of lean and fattier meats.  I use vinegar when I want to. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an interesting concept that is not necessarily well executed.  But it is a good springboard to start adjusting your diet to what your body needs.
0312965788|5.0|Well, books of short stories just don't get much better than this, do they?<br /><br />For me, Herriot is the only author in the world who can pull off heartwarming without being cloying. His amazing feel for the lives and dialogue of the Scottish farmers who he services gives each and every story a score of interesting details and conversation that is captivating for its novelty and authenticity.<br /><br />In this first book of the series, Herriot has more to say than at any other point in his career. Not that his brand of storytelling ever gets old, but here there is the added excitement of reading his first stories, for the first time.<br /><br />Another major draw for these stories is the look inside the nuts and bolts of veterinary practice, at a time when science was still struggling to overtake centuries of medieval techniques. Reading about sutures and powders and presentations is more fascinating than I ever would have thought possible.<br /><br />The character of Herriot himself is unflaggingly goodhearted, and yet utterly realistic; we see in him the best part of ourselves, and this too makes the stories a joy to read.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this series chronologically, so that you can join Herriot as he moves from young apprentice to old master.<br /><br />I wish there were a hundred books in this series, but at the same time I'm thrilled that there's even one book out there that acts as such a standard-bearer for excellence in storytelling.
B000002U9W|1.0|This is possibly the worst album ever released by a major artist. It's simply as lame and pretentious as music can get, and not in a fun way. There is nothing worth anyone's time here.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Rating:A <br />After Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor released Pretty Hate Machine in the late 80's, he found himself obliged to his record company TVT records. Under this obligation he was forced to record several albums, under their label, even though at this point in time Trent was ready to start his own label, which would eventually happen when he released The Downward Spiral, although TVT's name was still attached to the album. The problem was the fact that TVT believed Reznor's music was too dark, and in response to his \\"appreciation\\" for such a lenient record company, Broken was released; an 8 song ep that contains some of the most brutal and wrenching industrial music this side of Ministry and Skinny Puppy. Though clocking in at a little over 30 minutes, this is one of the most powerful, compressed, and intolerant albums that NIN would ever release. By combining raw emotion, and the animosity Trent felt being tied into his record company, every single song on this album shows such a departure from the poppish sound of Pretty Hate Machine, that not a single song on here sounds like anything on their previous effort. <br />The album starts with an instrumental track Pinion, which blends in effortlessly into Wish, a pulsepounding track that shows no remorse for any listeners eardrums as the guitars and drums pound with such power, that you might either be obliged to turn the CD player down a bit, or crank it all the way up (I'm in the latter group). With lyrics that talk about fist-F#cking, and hating everyone, few could argue that Nine Inch Nails could get any bolder after this album, but to the surprise of many Reznor returned after this with the Downward Spiral, a story of one mans descent into madness, and the eventual suicide he had prepared for himself. Tracks such as Gave Up really show NIN in its prime, moving towards the elevated success that they would find with TDS, and interspersing the lyrics with overbearing and enraged guitars, drums, and bass. Recorded at several different places around the US, most notably in Beverly Hills, where the Tate family murders were commited, and where NIN would return to record most of The Downward Spiral, this is a true progression of one of the best musicians of our time. Highly recommended stuff, oh and by the way as the interior says, don't play this album on mono devices unless you want your speakers blown to hell. <br />
B0006284JQ|3.0|Britney Spears has not been in the music scene for a long time to be releasing this kind of material.Furthermore, she moved from being a pop artist to trying to be something like Justin Timberlake \\"a wannabe hip-hop\\" artist. For her to be releasing a \\"Greatest Hits\\" says more to me that she has no real music to put out, considering her last 2 albums were flops and Madonna did not help her fame at all besides making out on that awards show (that's a cheap way to gain fame Britney,shame on U!).I'm giving this 3 stars because her first two albums were pop or bubble-gum pop and lately everything she's been releasing is her trying too hard to be more open to new music styles.The single \\"My Prerogitive\\" is Britney basically bitching about people getting into her personal business but really its just her whose throwing herself into the headlines only for the sake of still being in the public eye.UNECCESARY. So definitely, this \\"Greatist Hits\\" is really a waste of money and many people should overlook this release. Her latest single \\"Do Somethin'\\" is kinda weird. It confuses me, i mean is she trying to be pop?Hip-Hop wannabe? i mean WHAT? lately britney is only releasing these cheap albums to make a dime.i have to agree with one reviewer who said that her music is something to dance to so you're really not paying attention to lyrics as much as you're paying attention to rhythm.So Britney, I don't know what you're doing releasing this.
B00000JCOV|4.0|I am a fan of slipknot and a fan of a lot of the nu metal scene such as korn, linkin park, adema etc. this album has a lot of nu metal influences which is why i was drawn to this album but it just really doesn't have the consistency to be classed as a good album. i don't see any point in the 1st track which is the bar code from mate.feed.kill.repeat. (which is s**t really) but then (sic) jus rules over ALL. its brilliant and followed by the equally brilliant eyeless. the next track wait and bleed is of course the best song on the album showing that corey can sing. surfacing is also reasonably good as well as spit it out. from then on it becomes really really bad, with the only songs worth listenin to are liberate and no life. starts as a brilliant album but then fails near the end. stick with vol. 3 because it is a more consistent album <br />BEST SONGS: <br />Wait And Bleed 10/10 <br />(Sic) 9/10 <br />Eyeless 8/10
B0007GAERG|5.0|...ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS CD A RATING OF 6 STARS (ON THE SCALE OF 1 TO 5 STARS, WITH 5 BEING THE BEST)... BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY HEAR MARIAH SING THE WAY SHE WANTS TO...AND IN MY OPINION, SHE SOUNDS WAY BETTER IN THIS CD (well, not that she has ever sounded bad in any of her cd's)... AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST... SHE LOOKS AMAZING ON THE COVER!!! SHE IS SO FINE!!!
0451196716|5.0|This is one of my top five books of all time. I am not a big Stephen King fan but I love this book. It is a brilliant read. For me it shows how someone can overcome the odds and achieve anything they put their mind too.  <br /> <br />It's not about being the strongest or being the fastest,  being the fittest or being the healthiest. It's about being a good person. Having a good attitude. Ray Geraghty is a brilliant character and the character development in this story is amazing. You get to know all of the other boys doing the walk. It is all very real and you feel you are there with Ray every step of the way. <br /> <br />This is a an amazing classic that achieves what so many authors try to achieve. You empathize with the characters and even though its fiction that is very unlikely, while you are reading you feel like the story is real.  <br /> <br />So even if you are not a fan of fiction or of horror or of Stephen King, read this book you will love it!
B0007Y4USW|4.0|mariah carey's latest album of the emancipation of mimi is much better than i expected. i was always a fan of mariah carey when she first came out and have all her albums. and this one really has alot of substance.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was considering four stars, but then I listened to \\"Funeral\\" again. The beautiful swept me off my feet once again and I fell in love with the Arcade Fire all over. No other band out today does what the Arcade Fire does. You can compare them to the likes of Godspeed You Black Emperor! or Explosions in the Sky, but neither of them accomplish what the Arcide Fire does. Black Emperor, who are from Montreal as well as the Arcade Fire, create beautiful music, but they seem to get boring after a while and just don't have the \\"X\\" factor that the Arcade Fire seems to have. Explosions, who hail from Austin, Texas (I think?), create beautiful melodies but their music doesn't connect with a wide range of emotion as does the Arcade Fire's. Arcade Fire takes elements of classical music and infuses into their art rock, whereas Black Emperor focuses on the classical side of things and Explosions focuses on the rock side of things but with more artsy melodies. In my opinion, the Arcade Fire is a perfect fusion of these two mind sets and bring something else into the mix, though I can't really say exactly what it is. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", which is a great song with interesting lyrics, is not the best on the album, though still worthy of your listen. \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" was the first song that I really loved from \\"Funeral\\" and one of the best on the album. Then we have some song with a french name that I can't pronounce or type... but it is a good song nonetheless. Then we have \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" which is much different from the rest of the album, something that not a lot of bands do today and I like about the Arcade Fire. Then we have \\"Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)\\" which I think is one of the weakest songs on the album. I don't know why it just doesn't do anything for me. \\"Crown of Love\\" comes next. I love this song. It's very laidback but comes to a climax and leaves you wanting to listen to it again so you can soak moreof it up. \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Haiti\\" are good, though not highlights of the album. \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" (the new single) is good and I love the chord changes, they surprise me every time. And to finish it all off we have the meloncholy \\"In The Back Seat\\" which is a great closer because of its laidback feel and sufficient closing feeling. <br /> <br />Overall \\"Funeral\\" is very different from what is on the market today and everyone should buy it because it is so good. Don't let what people say about the Arcade Fire affect whether you purchase it or not. I wasn't going to buy \\"Funeral\\" because of all the people that were trashing it saying that the Arcade Fire is retarded. Hmmm, they can hate it if they want, but they are missing out on a great experience. <br /> <br />In conclusion, BUY THIS FRICKIN' CD RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|Have you ever seen a movie that was purely magical.  That gave you great feelings of fantasy and magic.  Well, this is one of those movies.  And this is probably THE best one out there in that sense.   <br />Jennifer Connoly is sort of a brat and is tired of taking care of her baby brother, but when she wishes him away to the goblin king(Bowie) she wants him back and must go through a giant labyrinth to get her brother.  Great job by Bowie and Connoly.  Great job with the muppets too.  If you appreciate fantasy and really good tunes, probably the best ever made by Bowie than I higly suggest you see this movie.
B0007GAERG|5.0|...is truly back, full force. Mariah sings better - purer, more powerful - than she has in a long time. She has continued to make wonderful music over the years, but this is her returning to her roots. Here you hear the energy that's been missing from her music for a while. I admit, the writing on certain songs is a little too radio-ready; the anthesis of a typical Mariah song. Those instances are so rare, though, and the songs so catchy, that there's not a song present that you won't find some reason to love.    Overall rating - 9/10    1. It's Like That - 9/10 It's a catchy party song with lyrics that actually say something, what's not to like??    2. We Belong Together - 10/10 This is one of those love songs that only Mariah could do. An instant classic.    3. Shake It Off - 7.5/10 Despite being the sure hit that any JD & Mariah collabo is guaranteed to be, even Mariah, The Voice, can get carried away with the whispering sometimes. True, it usually works where she uses it, but this song could do without it.    4. Mine Again - 8/10 A beautiful song, and more similar to the ballads she did in the infancy of her career than to anything she's done recently.    5. Say Somethin' ft. Snoop Dogg - 6.5/10 I actually really like this song....in theory. It's a great song, catchy; the chemestry that she and Snoop had on their last song together, \\"Cry Baby\\", just isn't there on this one.     6. Stay The Night 10/10 Some of the best vocals I've heard from Mariah in years. She truly outdoes herself on this one. It has a really soulful, retro feel to it that just sounds amazing.    7. Get Your Number ft. Jermaine Dupri - 7/10 This is a really fun song and probably would have gotten a higher rating from me if JD, who sings - yes, sings - the hook, didn't sound more than a little bit like Nelly on drugs. Seriously.    8. One And Only ft. Twista - 8/10 A great song....until Twista raps. I freely admit I'm biased; I've never liked his style. I love the way the song goes, though. Mariah does some really sexy low harmonies on here that just sound beautiful. She also (shockingly enough, very tactfully) demonstrates her whistle register on this song.     9. Circles - 11/10 One of the best songs I've ever heard. This is Mariah at her best, and by far my favorite song on the album. It has that old soul feel to it. It's a song about losing \\"The One\\", and you can tell she truly feels what she's singing. It's a song that, despite being about loss, I'm pretty sure most romantics will love. This would also make a great single if she decides to release another ballad. It's even better than \\"We Belong Together\\", and I can see it reaching \\"My All\\"-like heights.    10. Your Girl - 8.5/10 This is a great song, and it showcases a side of her voice that is rarely heard. It's just a really fun song, and I love listening to it.    11. I Wish You Knew -8/10 This song has a really intimate feel to it. It reminds me of one of a 70's style live soul performance (Mariah actually said the song had a sort of Diana Ross live feel to it; I was thinking more Natalie Cole). It's also a subject that a lot of people can relate to: having deep feelings for someone and not being able to tell them. It's just one of those songs that you can't help but love.    12. To The Floor ft. Nelly - 10/10 Without a doubt, one of the best collabos Mariah has ever done. When I first heard about the song, I had a feeling it would be a great song. I was right. This is a club banger if I ever heard one. It's one of those songs that would just take over radio.    13. Joy Ride - 10/10 Sexy. Think \\"Bliss\\" and then some...this song is just amazing.    14. Fly Like A Bird - 9.5/10 This isn't the typical Mariah inspirational track. One of my favorite things about most of them is the intense gospel feel, which she doesn't do here. This song is more subdued, but the message is just as deeply felt. It truly is a beautiful song, and the lyrics are something that everyone could stand to hear.    Buy the album, you won't be disappointed;in fact, you may be shocked at how good it is!! Despite being a huge fan, who knows that this woman's talent knows no bounds, I was.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This is one of those movies that is really easy to crack a LOT of jokes at because there is some seriously stupid stuff in it.  1.  Kate Beckinsale's phony transylvanian accent was enough to drive anyone crazy.  2.  Dracula is just so awkward.  He makes you want to look down everytime he shows up.  His lines are bogus.  It sounds like he's going blah blah blah. BLAH.  3.  Hugh Jackman is pretty boring.  4.  Overall,  too much cheesiness.  <br />GOOD STUFF IN THE MOVIE-  Couple of cool action scenes.  If you turned the volume off it would look cool and not anoy you.  Nice crossbow rifle.  I can't think of much else.  ITS PROBABLY NOT WORTH IT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
B00005V9HA|5.0|I remember watching this a long time ago, and it scared the crap out of me. I haven't seen it since, but I would like to see it again. The only thing that has been stopping me is people keep saying it is funny. I mean, are there funny parts to it, or is the whole thing just a dumb spoof. I don't really remember, and I don't want to fork out the hefty price for a dumb, unscary horror movie. What I remember of it, it was really damn scary. It had me hiding  behind the couch with my eyes behind my hands. But that was years ago. So what is this movie more similar to, Night of the Living Dead(scary as hell), or Return of the Living Dead(a dumb, unscary spoof)? Thanks.
B000059XUO|5.0|It's always odd watching the last on screen performance of an actor.  Especially when that actor had so much promise and potential than to see it cut short in a freak accident. Watch the film based on what it tells and shows you, not the fact that it's main star was tragically killed on set and you'll find a great movie, a capable comic book adaptation and a last great performance.<br /><br />Devil's Night(day before Halloween), rock musician Eric Draven and his fiance Shelly Webster are killed by a group of thugs over new apartment laws. One year later, he's brought back to life and watched over by a crow. With a mind for revenge, he hunts down all the people who killed him and his fiance.<br /><br />Before he did the god awful I Robot, Alex Proyas envoked such a unique atmosphere to his 2 best known films: Dark City and this. The atmosphere and the setting is perfectly done and matches the tone of the film.<br /><br />For all those curious as to the manner of Brandon Lee's death it's kind of confusing and just looking at it you wouldn't think it was real. A gun had to be loaded and fired in front of the camera. One of the prop masters dry-fired it so an empty cartridge got into the gun barrel. The next scene required the gun to be fired at Brandon so the gun was filled with blanks only with double the gunpowder to give it a loud bang only the cartridge was fired and it hit Brandon.<br /><br />Outside from that stuff, it really is a great movie and you should give it a chance and watch a great performance(the other people are good too)
B00005MP58|5.0|The hardest part in reviewing this film is where to start for it has succeeded in so many levels.  This 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is simply outstanding.  It excell in essentially every aspect.  It is faithful to the book and the sincerity to the time and place is geniunely thought out.  The costume, sets and scenery are exquiisite, it is a visual feast.  The music is absolutely superb.  The choreography is outstanding.  <br />The whole cast has a class I had never seen before, the characters are perfectly put togerher, they come alive in a way that I have not seen equalled by any other production.  From the main stars all the way down to the most menial of the servants.<br />Some characters may not look like what you have in mind but everyone did their part extremely well.  Although Jennifer Ehle in my opinion looks a bit heavy, in physical sense, for the part of Lizzy who was described as having a light and pleasing figure, she captured the spirit of Miss Elizabeth Bennet to perfection.  Susanah Harker as Jane I think is not five times prettier than the rest but she is wonderful as the sweet and good natured Jane Bennet.  The rest of the cast I believe pretty much look how they should look.<br />Colin Firth as Mr Darcy, what can I say, no one admitted to the priveledge of watching him could think anything wanting. He is spot on as Mr Darcy<br />The entire film is full of excitement and drama, the wit and humour of Jane Austen really shines, it is truly a sparkling comedy of manners with a spice  of passion and romance.  The scenes that are supposed to be powerful and dramatic are passionately and perfectly portrayed.  The whole cast delivered their lines and acted their parts with feelings and intelligence.  <br />At last, a film has finally done justice to one of  the greatest love stories in literature.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Extremely vulgar movie.  Why do we have to sit thorugh an E-mail exchange between two grown men engaging in fantasy sex talk, and disgusting sex talk at that.  It ruins whatever else the movie is trying to say.  This movie is just not worth watching.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I heard Ghost Love Score first- and just like everyone else--thought it was a really cool song. So i bought it--and found it was the only real decent song on the album--a couple others come close--but overall its just blah- and boring sound effects! SAVE YOUR MONEY
B0007GAERG|5.0|Fifteen years after Mariah Carey's debut, her new album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" shows that the voice, despite all the hoopla, is still there. Her voice is as versatile as Silly Putty -- she can coo, go high, go low and hold notes that Britney Spears can only dream about. And, of course, she can hit that signature dog whistle.  <br /> <br />And all of it is used to full effect on tracks such as the dramatic, gospelly number \\"Fly Like a Bird,\\" which features spoken words from the pastor at her Brooklyn Church; the breezy, stellar second single \\"We Belong Together\\"; and the booty-shaking soon-to-be-smash-hit \\"Get Your Number,\\" which samples Imagination's 1980 hit \\"Just An Illusion.\\"  <br /> <br />For \\"Mimi,\\" Carey, who weaved her way into an urban sound in the late '90s, worked with the Neptunes (\\"Say Something\\"), Jermaine Dupri (\\"Shake It Off\\") and Kayne West (\\"Stay the Night\\") on a slick mix of pop, hip-hop and soul.  <br /> <br />\\"It's Like That,\\" the album's first single, is one of several catchy radio-friendly tracks. Tailor made for clubs, the track's get-drunk-and-party-it-up message resonates with overwhelming results that make you wonder why Carey's been releasing a mish-mash of tracks unworthy of such a voice in the last few years (particularly on \\"Charmbracelet\\"). And the \\"I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me\\" theme of the song is prominent through much of the album, as she deals with the ins and outs of relationships.  <br /> <br />Speaking of relationships, on \\"One and Only\\" with rapper Twista, she's searching for her soul mate but keeps meeting the same ol' scum. \\"I gotta know he won't betray my trust, just like every other mother****** does,\\" she sings.  <br /> <br />Maybe it comes with age (Carey turned 35 last month) or her \\"I don't give a crap anymore\\" attitude, but Carey certainly has let down her guard. Of all her albums, \\"Mimi\\" features some of her most risqu lyrics. On the originally slated first single, \\"Say Something,\\" Carey says, \\"You are over there watching me too. Both painting pictures of how we'll kiss and f***.\\" Clearly not something you'd hear her say 10 years ago.  <br /> <br />But that's not to say she totally neglects the fans of vintage Mariah. On \\"We Belong Together,\\" Carey delivers what her longtime fans have been yearning for: a flawless tune that evokes the classic smooth, effortless voice without all the breathy vocals. The wisely chosen second single showcases Carey's songwriting ability (she also wrote the other 13 tracks on the album) and her knack for doing the main vocals over her own background vocals.  <br /> <br />The major distinction between \\"Mimi\\" and Carey's previous albums is her separation from her typical formula of glossy power ballads (\\"Hero\\" from \\"Music Box,\\" \\"Through the Rain\\" from \\"Charmbracelet\\"), introspective tracks (\\"Outside\\" from \\"Butterfly,\\" \\"Petals\\" from \\"Rainbow,\\" \\"Looking In\\" from \\"Daydream\\"), melodramatic cover songs (\\"Against All Odds\\" and \\"Without You\\") and ubiquitous rap cameos (\\"Heartbreaker\\" with Jay-Z, half of \\"Glitter\\").  <br /> <br />Although Twista, Jermaine Dupri and Nelly appear on the album, their cameos actually complement the songs rather than detract from it.  <br /> <br />Old time fans will cling to \\"Mine Again,\\" a classic Mariahesque ballad that's sparse on arrangement and puts Carey's voice in the forefront. Reminiscent of her first single, \\"Vision of Love,\\" the track, produced by James Poyser, is one of only a few songs on \\"Mimi\\" that boast the wholesome girl-next-door/balladeer image she portrayed in the early '90s.  <br /> <br />Although The Emancipation of Mimi is Carey's best album since \\"Butterfly,\\" it's also one of her least personal. But either way, this time around \\"Mimi\\" returns to what she's always been known for -- the voice.
B000001FQQ|1.0|This is pretty close to being a KISS  low point. <br />I Bought the Disc because it is KISS ( Mindless fan that I am), but the material just was not up to the 70's standard . If you like the original KISS  material, this is not one to buy, however, it is probably one to get if you need a complete collection, but do not expect  a KISS  album. Hard to see this as rock... and it certainly is not a good hair band album. <br />Blech
B000000WA4|5.0|This is a truly amazing CD.  The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best bands of the 90's, and this was the peak of their success.  2 discs, 28 tracks, 5  singles.  What more can you ask for?  Every track on this cd is great.  What is so great about this CD is that they mixed so many different styles, but personalized them to sound like the Smashing Pumpkins.  They were heavy with songs like Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Zero, and Bodies.  They were light with songs like 33, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, and Beautiful.  They showed a unique, different style with songs like Tonight, Tonight, Cupid De Locke, and Galapogos.  They rounded it out with An Ode to No One, 1979, x.y.u., and To Forgive, which were all truly sensational.  This makes it very hard to believe that one year before this release Billy Corgan had to record Pisces Inscariot by himself because the band had split.  This is the best of the Pumpkins, and this is the best of rock.
B000007XUQ|4.0|Having kept my two vinyl records around for years because only the edited single Carpenters Christmas Collection was available, I was thrilled when this CD was released. BUT, I was devastated when I discovered Richard took his remixing one step too far on the first CD. There is one glaring change that really bothers me. On the original recording, the segue between White Christmas and Ave Maria is played by an organ with a weird  but beautiful reverb sound...on this mastering of the collection, the part was replayed with a piano!!! It just does not segue as smoothly into Ave Maria, which is accompanied by the same organ that led into it! I had to keep my single Carpenters Christmas CD just for that original mix!!! Also, it would be nice if the original 45 mix of the jazzy Santa Claus Is Coming to Town would eventually show up on one of their compilations instead of the remix that contains a very different instrumental break in the middle.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I was a big fan of their last cd, Songs For the Deaf.  It made a huge impact with songs like Millionaire, No One Knows, and First It Giveth.  It was a sensational cd.  So I must say that Lullibies to Parylize was somewhat of a disappointment, although I expected a decline after the \\"breakup\\".  The Medication was also a good song, but it was less than 2 minutes long.  Some other songs like Tangled Up In Plaid, In My Head, and Skin on Skin were average, but not the best that QOTSA had to offer.  It is evident that the loss of Nick Oleveri hurt the individuality of the band.  Josh Homme put in a great effort, but it just wasn't the same.  I hope that this isn't the end of one of the greatest rock bands of recent history.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Blah blah blah about Tragic Kingdom, them losing their ska roots and selling out. If you love an artist, you love watching them grow, experiment, and expand...and No Doubt is BARELY even changed that much. All I hear when I listen to their music is a group that was incredibly influenced by a wide range of excellent music when they were growing up, take those influences, blend them together and write some of the strongest pop songs out there--yes I said pop...which is short for POPULAR which means anything that's played on modern radio and popular...as far as I'm concerned even the most underground music is POP...<br /><br />By the way...if you're looking for the No Doubt remake of Donna Summer's \\"Love to Love You Baby,\\" it's readily available on the Zoolander soundtrack.
0380973650|5.0|An amazing novel beautifully written and executed.  The characters and story are wonderful.  You cannot call yourself a fan of writing and give this book a bad novel.  Too many people come to the book with their own prejudices.  Hey, if you want to write your own novel, feel free to do so.  Along With Susanna Clarke Gaiman is one of the best writers working in the English language.
0743243315|1.0|The reason I gave this book one star is that it is not possible to give none. <br /> <br />Every time I walked into a bookstore for a couple of months I wanted to buy this book, because it was getting very good reviews and the beginning was promising. But once I actually bought it and started reading it, like many other reviewers, I found the story way too slow and boring. At no point did I feel I was actually getting involved in the characters' lives - I simply couldn't care less. After reading the reviews here I'm now definitely going to give up, even though I always finish my books and I regret having spent 10 Euros on a book I didn't even finish - but it just does not seem worth losing any more time.
0446677450|1.0|The top reviews here including the (Excellent book., July 18, 2002) review try to tell that the book is excellent (while it's not) and you'll find that 95% or more found a 3 lines review helpful and reliable to take a decision whether or not to buy the book! I guess that Kiyosaki gave $3 to 3 kids, $1 each (you'll know that this is what he's willing to pay if you read the book) to click hundreds of times that the review is helpful and the book is excellent!! The first story he told in the useless book was how he and one of his friends tried to counterfeit coins when they were children... this tells about the mentality of the author... I don't think I should write any further! BUT to recommend something useful, try to get books about Managing Cash Flow or The Wall Street Journal Guide to Money & Finance.  <br /> <br />According to one of the reviews here, I now feel $16.95 poorer cause I bought this book, I should've bought it from Amazon to minimize my loss.
B000096IBI|5.0|Chaplin's satire of the Depression and the factory as a dehumanizing force. It is the least sentimental of his great pictures, and might be his most popular because of it. Charlie is a victim of the assembly line, turning bolts at a maddening pace until he goes crazy. He goes to jail after getting caught up in a communist demonstration (unwittingly), and doesn't want to go free - he's happy in jail and taken care of: it's better to be there than in the world of no work or where he's brutally victimized. He befriends an innocent \\"gamin\\" (Paulette Goddard) living by her wits, and the scenes with her are lovely (minus the pathos). There is an absolutely astounding scene in a department store where Chaplin is rollerskating blindfolded near the edge of a balcony, and another (very famous) where he sings in gibberish in a cafe. The only talking in the movie comes via mechanical devices - a movie screen, a radio, a phonograph. For once at the end he gets the girl. A marvelous movie. Definitely worth a watch.
B00004SVID|5.0|When Pink Floyd toured, they only performed The Wall in New York and Los Angeles.  Through a ticket broker I bought two tickets that were seventh roll center on the floor.  The tickets were $45 each! <br /> <br />I remember every nuance of the show and I still wonder if there is a video of this excellent concert lurking somewhere. <br /> <br />Even though the recording is excellent, it can't touch the sonic/visual bombast that the show was.  To see Roger Waters just giving his emotional heart in the performance, the visuals projected on the Wall, and the sonic effects gave the performance a eerie/creepy vibe.  Some audience members were actually crying at some portions.  And when the wall came down in the end and the band came out spotlighted in a golden glow, it felt like a healing. <br /> <br />Waters and Mason elected to wear earphones.  Waters was singing into a wireless microphone (a technological first) that he would stuff into his back pocket when it wasn't in use. Each band member had a supporting musician, so everyone was doubled, even Mick Mason.  Plus there were supporting vocalist. <br /> <br />To me, The Wall touched on many layers. The show had all the themes that Waters likes to vent about, losing his father at a young age, confining English upbringing, divorce and unhappiness at seeing people acting like sheep. Waters also touches on war rallies as he withdraws into his internal mental hell. <br /> <br />Let me give you some of the visuals. <br /> <br />When the MC (Cynthia Fox from radio station KLOS) came out and did her shtick, the stage had lots of \\"technicians\\" walking around the stage and adjusting equipment.  While she was talking, the technicians parted and the group was already on stage ready to go, surprise, surprise.  And they cut her off in mid-sentence. <br /> <br />There were speakers on stage as well as the sides of the Sports Arena, just like the \\"Wish You Were Hear\\" tour.  So when 'In the Flesh\\" started, I thought that the sound wasn't as full.  Then the end came and as the band played the last long chord and the airplane came over the audience, symbolizing the death of Water's dad during the war, the side speakers and the true wrap-around sound kicked in. Quite a rush. <br /> <br />When the helicopter section played, on stage the lighting technicians sat on top of flying saucer that were on the stage floor.  They took off into the air and lit up the band, following the musicians around the stage.   <br /> <br />The puppets (you can see them on the Waters show at Berlin) were mind blowing.  Quite a feat to control their movements, so a nod to the supporting cast/roadies that you never see or hear about. <br /> <br />The movies were being played on a round screen above the band.  Seeing the intertwining flowers turning into monsters during sex and one snapping the head off the others to the song \\"Empty Spaces\\" was quite a wallop.   <br /> <br />When Waters sang \\"One of my Turns\\", he was outside the under-construction wall.  Next to him was a little Pink doll which he mimics as he sang.  As he screamed \\"Oh No\\" and the band went into solo, he jumped back behind the wall, and the wall continues to close.   <br /> <br />During \\"Don't Leave me Now, two giant puppets were on top of the wall and just glaring at Waters while he sang with all that creepy loud breathing flowing around the speakers just overpowering him.  And the wall gets completed except the one brick where Waters sings \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\".  I never forgot the music that was playing between \\"Another Brick in The Wall Part 3\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" and it is so nice to hear it again after all these years.  What was weird was that the band was playing behind the Wall and you could only see the top portion of the stage, with all the supporting lights and flying saucer pods doing their thing.  Gave a strange visual vibe. <br /> <br />The second act was performed with the audience having to deal with the wall.  The movie was projected onthe Wall itself and was done using three interlocked projectors.  It was perfection.  Even though sometimes only the center projector was showing a scene, the side ones were still on and the side film was pristine, you wouldn't know that they were on. <br /> <br />\\"Nobody Home\\" was done with a portion of the Wall that opened up showing a hotel room with Waters reclining in a chair watching TV. <br /> <br />\\"Comfortably Numb\\" was a high point, with Gilmore singing and soloing from the top of the wall.  You could see that he was really into it.  Must have been a thrill for him to be so high up and overlooking the crowd as his guitar solo spun around the monitors. <br /> <br />When the MC came out again, the band was pushed onto stage in darkness on a platform on rollers.  When they were illuminated, everyone was wearing the masks that are on the cover of this CD and acted like robots. <br /> <br />In \\"The Show must go on\\", as Waters sings 'Are there any queers in the audience\\", the flying saucer light technicians actually go out over the audience looking for offenders going as far as their supporting booms let them.   <br /> <br />On the CD right before Waters introduces \\"Run Like Hell\\", you hear him let out a shout as a spacey guitar cord is hit.  That is when the inflated pig breaks through the wall.   <br /> <br />\\"Waiting for the Worms\\" of course had the hammers marching across the entire wall which made it look like the whole wall was moving.  \\"Stop\\" and \\"The Trial\\" was just Waters solo in front of the wall just spilling his guts out.   <br /> <br />Then the wall came down to the booming base notes that shook the seats.  The whole audience just let out screams of relief as it came down.  The musicians came out from the side of the stage as themselves with Waters leading and playing the clarinet while kicking debris out of the way.  They stopped and sang \\"Outside the Wall\\", then continued the march off to the other side of the stage.  During the applause, the four members of Pink Floyd came out, took a bow, and everybody went home knowing that they had witnessed something special and never to be duplicated again. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is the first Mariah Carey record I have bought & lets sum what i think of it up. <br />An incredible Blend of uptempo beats, slow jam RnB ballads, and amazing ballads, Mariah has done it! <br />Her voice is purely amazing on this record and this album is full of fun and emotion! <br />Favorites on this album are: <br />\\"We Belong Together\\"- A soulful Slow RnB ballad with amazing vocals and a very urban slow beat! <br /> <br />\\"Say Something\\"- Incredible production, great catchy uptempo song, the heats up to the next level with a suprisingly melodic 'rap' by snoop dogg <br /> <br />\\"Stay The Night\\" <br />THE VOICE is just incredible in this mid-temp song. <br /> <br />\\"Fly Lik A Bird\\" <br />A beautiful peice of inpirational work,  <br />a song about being hope and peace for the world,  <br />about finding peace within faith <br />I must say, One of the best songs I've ever heard, <br />when i heard her perform it on 'Good Morning America' <br />I knew i had to buy this album!
B0007GAERG|5.0|After \\"Butterfly\\" for me, it seemed as though Mariah had a 'hit-or-miss' formula with her records.  Albums such as \\"Rainbow\\" & \\"Charmbracelet\\" would produce excellent singles...but as albums never held up.  Whereas \\"Glitter\\" (to me) was her best work since \\"Butterfly\\" because it found her, in her own corky way evolving as an artist.<br /><br />I have to say that I was worried about how I was going to take \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\"...the lead single (which has grown on me due to the video) seemed very well, pop-less.  But as a Mariah fan I purchased the record to support her & give it a chance.<br /><br />I am so glad that I did.  This record is literally satisfying from start to finish. Every track stands alone, yet is able to work as a cohesive unit to form the theme of Mariah's latest album.  It is almost as if she finally incoporated her adult contemporary element, hip hop-lite, & pop into a seamless piece. I can finally say that Mariah has found a way to bridge the gap between her younger fans & ones that are a bit older.<br /><br />Some of Mariah's best ballads since \\"Glitter\\" appear here.  The heart wrenching pull of \\"We Belong Together\\" (one of my favorties & talk about a great ending to that song!), the low-key funk flow of \\"Stay The Night\\" & the anthemic \\"I Wish You Knew\\" are simply stunning...& definitely a step above some of her ballads from \\"Charmbracelet\\".<br /><br />Here her guest-appearances finally feel more relaxed & aren't as grating.  The sassy bite of \\"It's Like That\\" & \\"Get Your Number\\" show that for Mariah, you really are as young as you feel.  But the key uptmepo track award goes to the techno-funk of \\"Say Somethin'\\" that finds Mariah reuniting with Snoop Dogg. This track rivals \\"Crybaby\\" (a previous collabo between the two) for pure mainstream RnB heaven.<br /><br />Vocally, it seems Mariah has managed to find a middle ground for her lower pitch & legendary higher pitch...this shows maturity in her department.  To continue to forge her path as a vocalist in her own right, & not conform to what people think she should do.<br /><br />Overall, I am proud & satisfied with Mariah's latest outing.  Congratulations Ms. Carey for a job well done.e her path as a vocalist in her own right, & not conform to what people think she should do.  <br /> <br />Overall, I am proud & satisfied with Mariah's latest outing.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|As an unknower of the original play, I thought this movie would be just another ordinary romance drama flick. It wasnt at all for me, the trailers didnt do it justice. It was non-linear with strong distinct characters. Pays omage to the good in people, diamonds in the rough.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I won't bother to recount the episodes or the cinematic excellence it entails. Others here have done it well. But once you watch this epic, you will NEVER question Tom Brokaw's assessment of those who lived and fought this war as our \\"greatest generation.\\"
B00008H2LB|1.0|This music suckz, they suck, they  cant play music or do anything, there music video consitsts of people standing around trying to look cool. I hate them, they shud stop now! There music is just plain crappy!You smell like cheese!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|I can honestly say it has been a while since I bought a CD that I listened to every single day damn near all day. This is one of those CDs. Upon hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\", I didn't think The Killers' next song would be good. This is largely based on the fact that so many bands these days come out with one good song and the rest are pure crap. I am happy to say this is not the case. Once I heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\", I decided to buy the album. It was only $9.99 @ Best Buy, so I figured what the hell. Once I heard \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" I knew I had found a gem. <br /> <br />This CD has it all. Rock, pop, electronica, new wave, 80's style...I mean how much better does it get? The songs flow so amazingly well that it is quite easy to listen to this CD all the way through. I am a habitual \\"track skipper\\" but with this CD, I don't need to skip to my favorite songs because they are all just great. You would truly miss out not listening to this from beginning to end. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD to anyone who just loves good music. I lost faith for a while, I didn't think good music existed anymore. But I have been proven wrong with this CD. It's a small step but a step nonetheless.
B0007GAERG|5.0|When Mariah wrote the song \\"Joy Ride,\\" little did she know that she would be describing the experience of her entire album. Because listening to \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is quite the \\"Joy Ride.\\" This is her most fulfilling album to date. She's literally outsinging and outshining people 10 years her junior with this record. Mariah sounds energized. For all the young people out there interested in having a long recording career, you better go out and get this album. Learn from the best.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|This is just another teen sexcapade movie. The usual crass humor. But it's hilarious. I love this movie so much. I didn't think about seeing it when it came out in theaters. But one night I was chillin' at a friend's house and we ended up watching the unrated version. Great movie. As always, it's better than the \\"rated\\" version. More nudity and what not. I laughed so hard from beginning to end. One funny ass scene after another. Scotty Doesn't Know is my favorite part. If it's not bad enough your girl is cheating, the guy or rather one of the guys she's cheating with makes a song about it. How great is that? This is a good movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when you want something lighthearted to watch. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. Many people pick this movie apart, but it really isn't meant to be taken literally. There are enough \\"serious\\" and depressing movies out there, I'm glad movies like this are made. I love to laugh and this movie is a guaranteed laugh.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|Why do kids love this band so much?  I have had to listen to my 13 year Niece play this album over and over again for the last 3 hours and in buying headphones for her, its the best money spent this year, as for this annoying band, as far as rock goes it is such a pile of crap and I just hope that eventually she will grow out of it.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Britneys hot in the music right now but since she said she going to have a baby she most likely wont be releases music this year so instead turn your attention to Nicki Foxx a hot young singer yet to release an album.... Go To Nicki Foxx.com and listen 4 your self shes the next BIG thang... you can listen to Dance With Me, Lets Go, I'm That Girl, Living Fantasy, & Cant Lose Control witch is the song people mistaked for Britney!!!!
B0007N1AI6|1.0|Judas Priest, the band that gave us monster tracks like `Victim of Changes', `The Sinner', `Exciter', `Beyond the Realms of Death' `Electric Eye', `The Sentinel', have just totally lost the plot.  There isn't a single track on this record that remotely has the depth and professionalism of their earlier constructive material.  It's a shame that Judas Priest have resorted to copying the mainstream grunge that's out there now.  Glen Tipton seems to be copying scales from Malmsteen/Becker and together with KK 'Drowning' they seem to be knocking out crap riffs you'd expect from shoddy miss-fits like Pantera.  The song construction on this album is just laughable especially the track `Loch-ness'.  Together with the dull and boring outdated 80's bondage look, Priest are nothing but a pile of outdated tedious crap.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|At last!!!! The group breaks away from even it's own signature sound to forge a new sound, one that bends genres, incorporates disparate elements and meshes it all seamlessly.    <br /> <br />This is the strongest edition of the group in years.  Gregoire Maret and especially  Cuong Vu lend so much to this recordings new dimensions.   Antonio Sanchez is the best drummer this group has ever had and he shows why on this recording. He propels and drives the group along energetically.   <br /> <br />The virtuosity abounds. Yes, there is some of the familiar here.  There is much subtlety here as well.  Vu's unique method of providing textures.  Rodby's steady, strong bass lines.   <br /> <br />You can hear the best of what the group is known for here as well . The lyricism and melodicism.   When the group slows the pace down, they still convey the rich atmospheric backing to the sensitive and emotive solos.    There segues are excellent as the group goes from minimalism to be-bop and many other places in between.    <br /> <br />There is much emotion here but present in a less overt way.   Pat's use of various guitar sounds, many of which he's not used before is quite inventive.  There's texture, contrast here.    Tension and release.  This one bears repeatedly listening since you will here more as you go along.   It's worth the effort. I have been a fan for years, but this miles beyond \\"Sound of Now\\"  and veritable light years beyond \\"Letter From Home\\" and \\"Still Life (Talking)\\".  This is a band redefining itself and doing it well.  A band not sitting back on it's laurel or simply relying on what has worked for it in the past.  This is one of the best recording you are going to pick up this year.   Imaginative, forward looking and exciting.   It demands your attention and rewards you for it.  <br /> <br />So many artists at this point in their career after so much artistic success begin to repeat themselves and reiterate what has already been done entirely too much  It'srefreshing to find an artist who's not afraid to strike in a new direction.   It's Pat and the group, the essence in a whole new way.    Kudos to Pat and the group
B0000047GA|5.0|Along with Miles Davis, Tony Williams helped invent jazz rock in 1969-70. \\"Emergency\\" is a definitive album, its somewhat subpar recording quality and Tony's vocals notwithstanding.  I actually don't Tony's singing at all.  A British reviewer said it added to the \\"otherworldly\\" quality of the album, and that's true. I admit the vocals are technically weak (he wanted to sound like Billy Eckstine, of all people!), but they sounds lost and mysterious, like a lost spirit wandering in deep space.  His \\"Beyond Games\\" is a jazz rap tune well before the age of hip-hop.   <br />    The album rocks like an inferno, with all three musicians bouncing madly off each other like grasshoppers on steroids.  Larry Young is simply My Man on organ; he is the definitive jazz organist in my opinion.  Lifetime allowed him to go as far beyond the everyday as anyone could imagine.  He creates fluid sheets of sound like a bubbling rush of raging water, a veritable tsunami.  And he improvises with consummate skill.  McLaughlin adds his own brand of savagery to the album, albeit in supremely fluent style.  He riffs harder than granite, and improvises in classic jazz style.  His \\"Spectrum\\" fully predicts the sound of the later Mahavishnu Orchestra, which brought Lifetime's innovations to a broad audience.  Played in hell-bent style, Carla Bley's classic \\"Vashkar\\" suits the band's style down to the ground.   <br />    And then Tony! He plays all out, always astonishing with his lashing cymbal (almost his signature sound) and unbelievable thunder.  He plays harder than anyone you'll ever hear, yet with frequent subtlety.  Tony drums as if he will not survive the session.  <br />   The sound quality: it's not clean and pristine by any means, but adds to the primal power of the music.  I can hear all the instruments well (the CD sounds better than the LP, certainly).  A \\"pure\\" recording might have detracted from the music's vitality.   <br />   Some say Lifetime didn't mature until \\"Believe It\\" and Holdsworth.  The A.H. version of the band produced one excellent album (\\"Believe it\\") and one rather average one (\\"Million Dollar Legs.\\")  The latter featured at best limited jazz improvisation and seemed to be designed for commercial radio.  In contrast, the McLaughlin Lifetime produced two great albums before it folded.  The Holdsworth Lifetime built on what the McLaughlin Lifetime created.     <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is absolutely the must have, biggest, hottest album of the year. Mariah is on fire. Every song is great, they're all my favorites. It's great to see that Mariah is feeling better. Her music is better then ever before. I've been a loyal fan since way back in the day, but this album will be #2 on my list of favorites from her, right after \\"Butterfly\\". Mariah you rock and you keep on going no matter what please, because you are talented, beautiful, an inspiration, and your music really helps me through a lot. THANKS! We love you. :)
B000005JA8|1.0|To Say That Beefheart Has No Talent Like Some Of The Other Reviews Is Wrong. He's Made Some Really Great Music. Although None Of It Appears On This Album.  Replica Was Somewhat Of A Test To See How Far Is Too Far...Now We Know...If Your Giving It Anything More Than 1 Star, You Probrably Find Beauty In Fingernails Skratching A Chalk Board....If Your Looking For The Good Stuff, Try Clear Spot Or Safe As Milk.

B00005JNTV|3.0|If anyone sees this movie thinking it'll be like a throw back to the old film noir films, then they're headed the wrong way with this film. The movie trailer gave it the \\"film noir\\" vibe. To me, even the Man Who Wasn't There (A Coen Bros. movie) is more of a film noir than this one. Film noir is a genre that spawned Double Indemnity, Touch of Evil, the Big Sleep, and etc. Not a film like Sin City. Countless voice-overs and the use of black and white via a green screen doesn't make a movie instantly a film noir. If people called it a comic book movie strictly, then I'd be fine. But it bugs the hell out of me when they bring the terms of film noir. Noirs have plots twists, backstabbing, shady characters, and a particular style to them that is different than other film genres, especially with their endings. Check out Chinatown (directed by Roman Polanski) or even The Big Heat (directed by Fritz Lang), and compare it Sin City.<br /><br />Why this movie gets 4 stars or above is beyond me. It had no social value nor was entertaining. It was basically sickening and in poor taste. Seeing the previews of this movie, I thought I'd go check it out, seeing as it had one of my all-time favorite action heroes in it: Bruce Willis. I figured it was going to be a bit weird, but I was unprepared for what I saw.<br /><br />No, this wasn't the gansteresque movie I saw in the previews, it was more of a movie geared towards the horny and moraless teenagers of today. This movie is nothing but sex, violence and nudity. No story. However, it had good acting and good effects.<br /><br />If you liked movies like Bully and Kill Bill, you'll most likely enjoy this film. Else, stay away and save your money for a better movie.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|What the members of Avenged Sevenfold have crafted here is an incredibly aggressive, loud, and technically impressive album; one that just fills you with energy and makes you want to punt babies over houses.  It's quite long, over an hour, but it never lets up. <br /> <br />It starts out with a cool, slow paced build-up of an intro, which leads to a kick-in-the-pants of a first actual song.  The singer screams at the top of his lungs as he is supported by pounding drums and bass and killer guitars, and Waking the Fallen never lets up after that.  This album is full of great hardcore sounds, especially on tracks like \\"Eternal Rest\\" <br /> <br />But the vocalist can do more than just shout himself hoarse, he can also sing, surprisingly.  This comes out the most in \\"I Won't See You Tonight - Part 1\\", an incredible song that eschews hardcore antics for a beautiful, epic melody with relatively thoughtful lyrics about suicide.  The track clocks in at around 9 minutes and is part of a larger 14 minute, 2 part behemoth of a song.  Like I said, it's a long album, and if you like this kind of stuff, it is definitely worth it. <br /> <br />Every song on Waking the Fallen is good, but except for a couple like \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\", they all sound pretty similar and you can lose track of where one ends and another begins.  But if that's something you can handle, you can't get much better metal today. 4.5 stars rounds up to 5.
0670033375|4.0|I find it interesting that there are so many books on the best sellers lists that  in one way or another deal with the challenges of the new century. It seems to reflect an introspection by the American people about their destiny.     \\"Collapse\\" is one such book. But that being said I believe it should be read as a series of  vignettes in history and what they might mean when we consider the future rather than being read  as a type of well reasoned, if subliminal, prophecy. It is a more enjoyable I believe if the reader takes in the information that is presented in a very pleasing fashion and draw their own conclusions.    Diamond is author of the very popular book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\"  and whose name is probably very familiar to anyone that haunts bookstores. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned book knows that Diamond is not afraid to give an occasional poke in the eye to formerly established theories. But Jared Diamond's approach to history comes from his unique perspective as a physiologist and geographer. His ideas, although sometimes in conflict with such traditional noted historians as William McNeill, are quite thought provoking. Sometimes it takes an outsider from a different discipline to shake things up a bit. His books remind me of the recent movement in leading universities to create \\"centers\\" that coexist with departments to take a multidisciplinary appraoch to fileds such as neuroscience that cross departments.    It is well worth reading and its ideas well worth considering however I find the title of the book to be slightly misleading, historical events somewhat \\"cherry-picked\\" and some of the conclusions to be a little bit of a stretch. My advice is to read it with an open mind. However there is one message of this book that is very much worth remembering and is timely: societies that are inflexible are destined to fail.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm a firm believer in that Mariah was never gone and that because of the stress in her life in the recent years (thank God it seems to be over!) she's made some bad choices when it comes to the last two albums she did \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\". But lurking behind were some germs in these albums that one just could not discard as bad songs. That said, she hasn't been gone, just trying new things that didn't work out. Hopefully now that she knows better and has gone back to her old self - and doing the stuff that we love her for - she's learnt her lesson and will continue on this path. She's sounding great, definite highs - though there aren't any lows - are: we belong together, mine again, say something, stay the night, one and only, circles, i wish you knew, and fly like a bird. Hopefully Whitney and Toni will take a cue and give us some good old music - they need to go back to their roots because they are the goddesses and the industry needs them in the wake of the new divas that are just not making the grade.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Wow, this CD must be on track to sell big with all the haters coming out in full force like this. This is by far Mariah's best album. Her vocals really shine on this CD. I wasn't sure what to expect even though I've been a Mariah fan forever. But I was not disappointed, but pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the album. This is the first great CD of 2005. Get this one.  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That 10/10 <br />2. We Belong Together 10/10 <br />3. Shake It Off 7/10 <br />4. Mine Again 10/10 <br />5. Say Something 8/10 <br />6.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|I found this movie to be immensely boring and seriously lacking in plot and substance. However, what I did find refreshing was the lack of foul language and the lack of sex scenes. That is the reason I gave this movie 3 stars.
B0007GAERG|5.0|<br />man...these reviewers are seriously gettin on my nerves...whatever happened to decency and respect for music?? To all the peeps who gave her a 1 star review...you seriously are either tone deaf or unbelievably obnoxious. one of them even wrote that she couldn't sing...that's like saying michael jackson can't dance.  <br /> <br />What's wrong with you? Don't you have the least bit of rationality in you? Her style of music, appearance or whatever may not appeal to you, but we're not writing reviews on Mariah Carey...we're not profiling her in any way....we're freakin writing a review on her album....get it people? her ALBUM..not her.  <br /> <br />you could not be any more unethical. It's ridiculous...i mean, yeah, everyone has their own opinions...but god...giving her just 1 star is seriously blowin things out of proportion.you cannot possibly argue that she is NOT a good singer...bad production maybe...bad lyrics maybe...but bad singer? yeah..only if you're tone deaf. <br /> <br />it's bad enough you think she can't sing, but to say that she sounds like a dog's whistle? or that she shrieks?  <br /> <br />and my fave...as some buffoon named A.Ramirez put it...\\"Mariah Carey doesn't sing. Instead, she screams and screatches like a little puppy.\\" If i were to employ the same mental state as you do...stating that Mariah Carey doesn't sing and instead screams...i'm then forced to state that you don't..how should i put it...think?  <br /> <br />Humor me then...how do the other female artists out there sound like to you? fart?  <br /> <br />i mean...keepin it real...if you have no respect for music at all..go ahead and diss her...if you think you do, get the album...simple as that. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah's styles on this album are very different from her usual style and she has tracks on there that make you understand who Mariah is and what sets her from other artist. Party tracks such as \\"It's Like that\\" and \\"To the floor\\" set the club scene. For the love scene there's \\"Mine Again\\" \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"I wish u knew\\",etc. There's so much on that album and for the ones who hated it Glitter or Charmbracelet its nothing like that on the album.. a matter of fact there's few rappers just 3 on there so there shouldnt be no type of complaining as to how much guest apperances.. This album has something for everyone who likes everything from Jazz,Gospel,RnB, and Pop and if ur a faithful Mariah fan you can listen to her whole catalouge up to this point and notice that this is 'Down-to-earth Mariah'. She's calling the shots being her own woman. (if u have to put her in a catagory) but yes this is one of her best albums to date. Butterfly is still the best though! :) PS- the ONLY thing i would change on this album would be to make the tracks a little bit longer...LOL..the album is 50:10.
6305949980|5.0|This comparison would never have occurred to my had I not turned on my radio to a short bit on an opening musical the night after watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Danny Elfman's scoring for this 'operetta' is more than a little reminiscent of the music one popular in the Yiddish Opera style.  For northern European Jews who had come from life in the shtetls (little towns) this music was comfort food and I thing that Nightmare owes more than a little of its attractiveness to fond memories of the klezmer style.  Your experience, of course, may differ.<br /><br />At any rate, the story does indeed take place in a shtetl, although this tiny town is really Halloween Town, and the residents could never be mistaken for anything else than the charming monsters that they are.  Led by Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, Halloween Town is wrapping up its annual party of horrors and poor Jack is discovering that Halloween has somehow lost its meaning for home.  Torn by his own dismal feelings he walks through the night until, by an accident of fate, he stumbles on another town full of joyful elves and decorated trees - you guessed it - Christmas Town.<br /><br />Suddenly Jack is overwhelmed by the new feelings that Christmas seems to awaken in him.  In a burst of envy Jack determines that this year Halloween Town will do Christmas in its own unique fashion.  All the townsfolk join in Jack's merry plot except for rag doll Sally whose unrequited love for Skellington tells her that kidnapping Father Christmas is a potential disaster.<br /><br />All of this is done in delightful musical style with an animation style that is part old and part new.  A feast for eye, ear, and even heart.  The story is simple but meaningful, as Jack discovers that Christmas is not about anything that you can touch or feel.  And that there is a time to be terrible and, yes, a time to love as well.
B000003TA4|2.0|its good... but I got 'Ten' first, & since Ten & Nevermind are considered the 2 groundbreaking albums at the time, I got Nevermind after Ten <br /> <br />Im mystified how anyone can think Nevermind is just as good, or better than something as magnificent as 'Ten'
B000002OMN|5.0|Practically every genre of music has its own masterpieces.  Late 70's white-boy rock fantasy is a genre not many people appreciate, but I have the age and background to.  This album is exactly like its great predecessor \\"Bat Out of Hell\\"; it makes up for not being the groundbreaking shocker BOOH1 was by being more complex and much longer (without sacrificing any energy).  Steinman's writing is brilliant, and Meat Loaf's vocals are just as good as in 1977 (voice less angelically beautiful now but he's even better at drenching the songs in emotion).
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is by far one of Mariah's best CD's!  I love this CD and was worth every penny!  I hope Mariah tours again! ~~Steph~~
B0006IIKS0|4.0|The fact that I am a fan of Metallica's music might have detracted from my ability to summarize the extent of the documentary, but, like the reviews on the DVD clearly state, you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this movie.  Sure, I can remember when I was a wee lad of 16, hanging out in the parking lot of the San Diego Sports Arena (1986 Opening Act for Ozzy) with Jaymz and Kirk and Larz and the dearly departed Cliff Burton and being inspired by how cool and calm and normal they were.  That night they blew Ozzy off the stage with their short Master Of Puppets set and I have been a die hard fan ever since.  Now I am so much older and they are so much older and things have changed . . . for better or worse?  Hard to say.  Being that I was not even remotely impressed by the release of their St. Anger CD, it made me wonder what had happened to the Metallifux to bring them to the place where they are now, both musically and emotionally.  Well . . . Some Kind Of Monster gives us the answer to that question and others by chronicling the journey that took place between the start of recording St. Anger and the two years it took to complete it.  Inside looks are not often very true, but I felt that this one was.  A lot of therapy going on, which I didn't like all that much.  The dude they were paying some outrageous bucks for mental stability boosts seem stupid to me.  In fact, the part where they were going to cut him off and he tried to talk them out of it made it clear how nonessential he was to them.  Play music, feel better, put together a little set for the AFC championship game (so sorry that Jaymz is a Raider fan.  Steelers all the way!!!) play with the kidz.  Cool.  Seeing Lars sell his favorite paintings for somewhere around $6 million at auction made me wonder what it must be like to go from rags to riches in these guys' minds.  Jaymz takes off for rehab right in the middle of recording and . . . they wait . . . and wait . . .  only to have Jaymz come back with some rules and tells Lars that he's not comfortable playing music with him.  Jesus.  What a blast to the ego.  Throughout all this, Kirk remains the straight-man, the ego-less voice of subdued, non-threatening reason.  The part where Lars sits down as part of his therapy with Dave Mustaine is eye-opening and insightful.  \\"You made people hate my f*cking guts!  What happened to my little Danish friend?\\"  The reality of it all makes you step back and appreciate where you are.  Are they millionaire crybabys?  Maybe?  Do they need to pay some guy megabucks to make them feel secure?  Probably not.  Not a firm believer in all those make-yourself-feel-better, self-help gurus, I found it kind of demoralizing to watch my hero Jaymz play into that scenario.  Overall, though, I gotta say, I was entralled with this candid look into the twisted world of the world's most popular/successful metal band of all time.  This makes the disappointment of St. Anger that much easier to swallow. Metallifux unite.  Metal up yer ass!  And all those cliche metal phrases.  Once again, you don't need to be a fan of Metallica to enjoy this documentary.  It stands alone.h some rules and tells Lars that he's not comfortable playing music with him.  Jesus.

B00000099Y|5.0|This album is perhaps an album that is a steal at sticker price.  Listening to Maynards lyrics in this album makes you think he singing about something.  But when you look up what people think of some of the songs, espically \\"Forty Six and 2\\"  and \\"Stinkfist\\"  ; You start to realize these are open ended statements.  People's imaginations just take off with this album.  Listen to the album, think about what he talking about, then look up what the rest of the world thinks.  You'll be in for a real treat.
B0000062GE|5.0|This Album deserves so much more air time.  It doesn't get anything on any local radio stations.  This music does not seem to age.  Audiophiles eat your heart on this one.
B000000OQF|5.0|UYI 1 was bad exept for Live & Let Die & November Rain, and UYI 2 <br />was okay. This turns out the best rock album in the whole  <br />world. The mean dirty sexy drug songs are My Michelle, Your Crazy, & Anything Goes. Sometimes this album is very boring. The <br />best band in the whole world ever was Dire Straits because Mark <br />Knopfler was the best vocalist. Anyway REVIEW all these songs. <br /> <br />WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE-Instant classic! Axl makes you want to laugh sinngling this little song. It's a very funny classic with <br />slash doing his best riff. <br /> <br />IT'S SO EASY-Kinda stupid. The music is great but the lyrics are <br />totally god damn stupid. Axl will kill you in this song. <br /> <br />NIGHT TRAIN-Great rock song, but kinda the reapeative song ever! <br />This song seems like that Axl has been smoking nicoteen during this song.  <br /> <br />OUT TO GET ME-Kinda song that Dizzy Lamb wants to hear and how <br />Pablo Sanchez hates this song. It's so great but not the greatest. <br /> <br />MR BROWNSTONE-One of my favorite songs ever! This riff is so amazing and vocals are never stupid or mean. This is Dizzy Lamb's <br />favorite song on the entire CD. <br /> <br />PARADISE CITY-Kyle Buhman bought this album for this song and <br />this is one of my favorite songs on the cd. The riff is so amazing. Another instant classic! <br /> <br />MY MICHIELLE-I hate this song! It is stupid, mean, ugly, dull, sex, drugs, liquor, violence, nicoteen, and it is the weakest <br />song on the entire cd. I think I'll kill Axl rose in this song. <br />This song sounds simular to Back in Black. KILL YOU KILL YOU AXL! <br /> <br />THINK ABOUT YOU-Greg Maddux loves this song. It is not a great <br />intro but it is quite good. <br /> <br />SWEET CHILD OF MINE-Their best song. A great intro to a Backyard <br />Baseball 2005 game with the Oakland Athletics. Dizzy Lamb loves <br />this song and this is one of the best songs to Heavy Fuel. <br /> <br />YOUR CRAZY-Sex, drugs, liqour, mean, dirty, violenty, and ugly. <br />I hate this song. KILL THIS SONG WITH AXL. <br /> <br />ANYTHING GOES-HATE HATE HATE! Never tune to listen to. It is mean <br />dirty, ugly, dull, sexy, druggy, & violenty. KILL AXL ROSE RIGHT <br />NOW. <br /> <br />ROCKET QUEEN-A great closing track with a very sad ending. <br /> <br />This album is so darn boring. Buy On Every Street insted. <br />
B0000TLA9G|5.0|If you are looking for a good band like GUNS N ROSES, TRY DIRE <br />STRAITS they are the best band ever! That is Dizzy Lamb's favorite band. The songs on this CD are better than AFD. There <br />are no sex, drugs, violence, mean, & liqour like AFD. The only <br />bad songs are Aint it Fun and Sympathy For The Devil. Buy the <br />CD even if you like GNR.  <br /> <br />Dizzy Lamb likes Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, Civil War, You Could Be Mine, Don't Cry, November <br />Rain, Live and Let Die, & Since I DONT Have You. <br /> <br />Nomar Garciaparra likes Welcome to the Jungle. <br /> <br />Abner Dubbleplay likes Sweet Child of Mine, & November Rain. <br /> <br />Shawn Green likes Patience. <br /> <br />Sammy Sosa likes Paradise City, Knocking on Heaven's Door, & <br />You Could Be Mine. <br /> <br />Ichiro likes Since I Don't Have You. <br /> <br />Alex Rodriguez likes Patience, Paradise City, Knocking on Heaven's Door, Don't Cry, November Rain, & Sympathy for the Devil.  <br /> <br />Greg Maddux likes all songs. <br /> <br />This is a great BYB 2005 intro.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This album is totally amazing. I can tell you that most songs are <br />amazing. Calling Elvis, On Every Street, Bug, Heavy Fuel maybe <br />personal favorites and all those songs are HITS!! Buy this with <br />On the Night, & Brothers in Arms and then you get the best 2 Dire <br />Straits CDs ever! Dizzy Lamb loves Heavy Fuel because it rocks <br />and it is an intro to BYB 2005 game. Dizzy likes Calling Elvis, <br />Bug, & Heavy Fuel the best.
B00006V9A0|5.0|The best songs on this compilation were from 'NEVERMIND'. It also <br />has that hard rocking All Apologies. Smells Like Teen Spirit is <br />a classic that I could listen to over and over again and that's <br />Dizzy Lamb's favorite song. This album is going to be sold out <br />at one BYB game.
B000002MJR|5.0|Their best cd there is. We've sended out this album on the day <br />when we had a great BYB game. Dizzy loves Heavy Fuel and Nomar <br />likes Walk of Life. Great CD.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|this cd is only great for telegraph road which is a fourteen minute track.  <br />
B0000584V3|5.0|These guys could play circles around any band, whether metal, punk, jazz, classical, whatever. This is the finest of all Opeth albums by far. The ability of these Swedes to make beautiful music one moment, and then brutalizing metal another, is stunning. And the singer: is this all the same dude? He growls like the vocalist in Napalm Death, and then he sings....I mean, he REALLY sings! You have to hear it to believe it. Opeth may have the most talented voice, since Glenn Danzig started crooning for the Misfits. In fact, he may even put Danzig to shame. <br />I know, they're really long songs (most over 10 minutes)...but Opeth writes songs within songs. The hooks, especially on \\"Bleak,\\" are amazing. And \\"Harvest?\\" Can any other metal band, death or not, compose such a moving track?  <br />This band needs to be saluted for caring so much about recording complex, captivating songs, when they know they'll never be on the radio, they'll never be recognized off stage, they'll never appear on Oprah or the Today Show, and they'll never become millionaires. They make music that's original and interesting - music that they can be extremely proud of. Gee, what a concept.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|This is definitely a feel good film.  I have watched it three or four times, and I always end up smiling.  There are several stories intertwined among a group of people which might be described as being related through \\"six degrees of separation\\", i.e. somebody knows somebody knows somebody.  Curtis has showed imagination in including a couple who meets as they perform as \\"body doubles\\" and another young man who visits the U.S. to look for his own kind of gold and strikes it rich.  There are several resolutions, and a couple of relationships where the viewer is left wondering what is going to happen - the 40 something couple who has reached a fork in the road, the young woman who may lose the love of her life because of family responsibilities and the young man who, out of respect for his best friend, did not speak of his love for the friends girlfriend until it is almost too late.  This situation is rather odd, and one wonders how it will turn out.  The rocker is wonderful even though it is a sterotype of the rock star of the 60s still playing in his 60s.  One of the reviewers said the story plot was confusing; I don't agree.  However, as with any film with more than one plot line, one really needs to sit still and pay attention, but a serious film viewer would do that anyway - right?
B00000BKI4|5.0|The 1st time that I listened to Deserter's Song I thought \\"What the &*## is this?\\". My Wife, who I figured would hate it because of the unusual, even shaky, vocals walks in 3 days later and says, \\"That Mercury Rev albumn is great!\\". Again I am thinking \\"What the &*##?\\". I Gave it another try and fell in love with it.  I have been a huge Sparklehorse fan for years and if I had to squeeze Mercury Rev into the same genra. <br /> <br />Deserter's song is very quickly rising to the top of my all time albumns and is definately worth a listen and then another and another and another...
0060590165|4.0|just not as good Sabriel in my opinion. Sabriel is 5 stars, and i would rate Lirael as a 4 3/4 stars. Now if Sabriel had been the main character, probably it would have been 5 stars.  when the truth comes out about Lirael and who her parents are(more father than mother) at the end was stunning. Never would i  have guested.  When they encounter Chlorr and Sam rages into the fight the unknown necromance at that time, u could tell Sam and Touchstone are father, son. Just like Touchstone, excpet not as wimpy. As i said in my review of Sabriel, Garth has a gift for suspense. all through the book, i kept saying to myself, with is this evil and i want to no now. I definitely gonna read Abhorsen.
B0000YEEG2|4.0|As this first volume of Captain Herlock opens, the last of the crew of his ship, the Arcadia has been captured. The authorities believe that the era of space piracy has finally ended. But they've forgotten one thing. Captain Herlock is still numbered among the missing. He's only come out of hiding because he was summoned by a scientist who has vital information about a great threat to the whole universe, the demon Noo. Arriving too late to save the professor, he is able to keep his son, Tadashi, from being taken by Noo's undead minions. Herlock must gather his crew from an unpenetrable prison in order to have any chance of fighting this great evil! <br /> <br />The production on this title is top-rate, giving it a film-like quality. The designs try to emulate a 70s anime but the look always seems natural, not forced. All of the main characters radiate enigmas and chew up the scenery with intensity lacking in most live actors these days.
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|It's often been said that Star Trek producers and writers have the easiest and hardest jobs in the world simultaneously.  Different people tune in, pop in a disc, buy a ticket, or otherwise view Star Trek for different reasons. There's some that show up for nostalgia of the old Shatner/Nimoy series, the optimism of Gene Roddenberry's vision, maybe because they've lost some optimism over the years. Others want to be challenged with new ideas, new philosophies and viewpoints. And some, probably more than any of us would like to admit, watch to see weird aliens and ships blowing up. So, although the first group will generally be happy no matter what, it is very difficult to make a Star Trek movie to appeal to the latter two at the same time. The ones that do, though (Wrath of Khan, First Contact), are the ones that are the most memorable.  <br /> <br />Insurrection tries to split the difference. Although the ideas of imperialism and \\"might makes right\\" are examined, they are often maddeningly relegated to the background for another action sequence. The result is a film that never gains a steady intellectual footing, but also never really develops a compelling-enough story to be more than a light show, but it is a fairly good light show. <br /> <br />That being said, the movie opens perfectly. Data seemingly goes crazy, exposes a \\"duck-blind\\" to study a primitive people, then engages in a dangerous outer-atmosphere tango with Captain Picard, which is an excellent scene in nearly every way. It is funny, in an absurd way, but also invigorating, and after seeing its brilliance, you figure that the movie might just live up to its predecessor. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a bright spot in a movie filled with scenes that hit the wrong chord. The subplot about Data discovering his inner-child doesn't really distinguish itself from Data's myriad attempts to understand humanity in the series (does anyone else remember his beard?). The Son'a don't make great villains-they'recold, vengeful bastards, but they don't seem to realize it, like Khan did, so they can't have fun with it. Rather than being villains you love-to-hate, a. k. a. the best kind, they're just villains you hate. Picard gives a speech so self-righteous, he starts to sound like Janeway. Okay, using a pure moral system, the removal can't be justified, but moving 600 people to improve the quality of life for billions? Come on, at least think about it. Picard's much-older love interest subplot does have some juice, but the scenes about slowing down time are preposterous, just another unnecessary element in a sea of gratuitousness. And the ultimate nadir is when Riker pilots the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, an enormous and sophisticated 24th century starship, with what appeared to be a Thrustmaster joystick, circa 1997. (Speaking of beards that should be remembered...) <br /> <br />Much has been said of the humor in this movie, and some of it does hit its mark, but Worf's \\"aggressive tendencies\\" line and Counselor Troi's \\"boob\\" line are groaners, and in series that have generally gotten by on tense action and drama, going for laughs is a sign that you've run out of material. Check out Superman III for proof of this. <br /> <br />I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on these guys-the movie is a lot better than Nemesis, if only because it isn't obsessed with gloom. Jonathan Frakes once again sits behind the director's chair, and he tries to make this hodgepodge work, but unlike before, the performances are surprisingly unnuanced. Where before he was able to expertly juggle planet-side and ship action, keeping both storylines interesting, he now struggles to keep the action engaging on either front, all the while the movie begins to feel like a cookie-cutter action project-which is NOT a good thing. This movie came out only two years after First Contact, so I think that there wasn't enough time to develop it. I hope so, anyway, because in spite of a few scenes, this one ranks just above The Motion Picture and Star Trek V on my list of quality. If you want entertainment in a Trek movie, you might enjoy this one (emphasize might). If you are looking for something more, don't bother.
B0006399FS|1.0|Real music fans have already read the great article in Magnet on the Back page about U2.  If you like being ripped off you probably bought the deluxe version for 35.00, and you got your money's worth. You waited around to get tickets to this tour but couldn't because some chick from Minnesota had faster fingers. Don't fret Irish loving music fans catch U2 on the Corporate Waste Tour with Papa Roach and Nickelback, and pretty soon you can buy a new version of this album only it has remix versions and a few studio throwaways that couldn't make the grade. Where is Zooropa when we need it?
B000007T1M|5.0|I knew I needed a System of a Down CD when I heard Chop Suey!, Toxicity and B.Y.O.B. on the radio. So I bought this. And let me tell you....IT'S AWESOME! IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS AND YOU ARE A METAL/HARD ROCK FAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!!!!!!! Here's all of the songs and what I think of them.<br /><br />1. Suite-Pee: Strange name. Anyways, this is a fast song and a great one to start off the album with. In this song, Serj ranges from piercing high screeches to death metal-like screams. Also, strange lyrics; \\"Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture, lend me thy blades, we're crossed and terrored ravages of archtecture, hoist around the spade.\\" This is an awesome song and as I said, a great opener.<br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />2. Know: Still a good song, not as good as some others. As many other tracks in the CD, this is very fast and LOUD. They sing about women flying up into the sun. Yeah....... Not at all weak, but not as good as Suite-Pee, Sugar and some others. Also has a death metal touch to it.<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />3. Sugar: When this started, I didn't know that Know had ended. The end of Know and the beginning of Sugar sound almost exactly the same. Awesome, awesome chorus and overall a great, complete song. But who are the Kombucha Mushroom People? Awesome song, though.<br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />4. Suggestions: Although slower and more melodic than Sugar, Suite-Pee, etc., this is still a great song. Odd song. It's got a pretty fast chorus but not the rest of the song. In one part of the song, Serj sounds VERY weird.<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />5. Spiders: This is even slower than Suggestions. Strangely a bit haunting, this song is great. It's about people's dreams not being \\"protected\\" anymore. On another note, this is the second single off this CD.<br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />6. Ddevil: This song seems sort of silly in a way. I mean, they say \\"Shake your spear at Shakespeare\\" and at part of the song, it seems like Serj is chirping...<br />My Rating: 8/10<br /><br />7. Soil: I liked this song. It's another hard, metalish song unlike Spiders and Suggestions. It's about a close friend commiting suicide or something like that. Strange subject to sing about, yes, but when you think about it, System of a Down has done stranger things. I liked it.<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />8.War?:  Serj really shows off his voice on this song. Apparantly, someone's gonna fight the heathens.<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />9. Mind: Starts off really slow, and for the first minute and a half, they basically whisper. But it gets louder. In the song, you'll hear one of the oddest sounds you'll ever hear. It's like \\"EEARHREGIOAHGSRHWSAIOHGFH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" As you can tell, I can't describe it very well. In this song, they say free thinkers are dangerous. That probably has something to do with the government.<br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />10. Peephole: \\"Don't you ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high.\\" They must say this about 1000 times in this song. I like this song, but I like A LOT of others are better on this album.<br />My Rating: 8/10<br /><br />11. CUBErt: I think Serj is chirping again in this song. This song is about overpopulation in a country and everybody starving to death. Odd song, very loud. I like it!<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />12. Darts: At the beginning, Serj sounds possibly the weirdest and the screechiest on this whole CD. On this song, there's a lot of death-metal screaming and then almost complete silence except for talking. In the background, I think I heard that \\"EEARHREGIOAHGSRHWSAIOHGFH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" again. That freaks me out.<br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />13. P.L.U.C.K.(Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowardly Killers): In my opinion, the oddest song on the whole album. For about 1/4 of the song, Serj screams or music plays, then there is COMPLETE silence. This song is about the Armenian Genocide. As I said, odd. I really like it, though.<br />My Rating:10/10<br /><br />Okay, I'm done rating the songs. My top 3 songs on the album are:<br />3. Spiders<br />2. Suite-Pee<br />1. SUGAR<br />  So, for a conclusion, I will say;<br />BUY THIS ALBUM! I look forward to getting either Toxicity, Steal This Album! or SOAD's coming album, Mesmerize soon. Bye.BUY THIS ALBUM! I look forward to getting either Toxicity, Steal This Album! or SOAD's coming album, Mesmerize soon. Bye.
B0000584V3|5.0|BUY IT!!!! I can't recommend this album highly enough to do it justice.  This is great because the opening track gives you the growling vocals that you expect from a \\"death metal\\" album, but the rest of the cd is more on the mellow side.  If you do want more of the growling, then check out My Arms, Your Hearse.  Favorite tracks: Harvest, The Leper Affinity
B000003CKH|1.0|I'm wondering if Cake is giving credit to the authors of two Latino songs featured in Fashion Nugget. Half of the song \\"Perhaps\\" sounds exactly like \\"Fernando\\",a hit in Portuguese, sung by Perla about three decades ago in Brazil. The other half of \\"Perhaps\\" is of course Sera, Sera, Sera..which any Spanish speaking person is very familiar with. Makes you wonder whether the other beautiful songs in the album are \\"creative collages\\" as well..Who knows, who knows, who knows ??
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Finally bought this DVD and watched it over 3 nights, running whole sections over twice. The depth to which this film plumbed my psyche was absolutely unbelievable.    I'm a hard and fast Eastwood fan, but this film surprised me in its layers of meaning. So many issues are on the plate: sexual manipulation, sexual molestation, murder, insanity, love and family, authority and power. Parts of Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth intertwine in a lower middle income Roman Catholic neighborhood of Boston. But what stuck with me the most was the ending, without which I think the film's meaning would have been much simpler. In the ending you have two characters, the wives, whose presences up until then have been supporting, all of a sudden taking over. Laura Linney's final monologue and Marcia Gay Harden's mute desperation on the sidelines of the parade were of Shakespearean magnitude. They both left me with a chilling feeling that has haunted me since.    I thank Eastwood for getting such great performances out of his excellent cast.
B00005ABI8|1.0|The song \\"Perhaps\\", which sounds like a collage of songs is actually half (gasp) Abba's Fernando! I'm wondering what other 70's treasures are hidding in this Cake..
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck sympathetically depicts life at the bottom of the working class, where people \\"never seem to give a damn about nobody.\\"  Here it's black against white, rich against poor, and every man for himself.  George and Lennie, two itinerant ranch hands, are different: George looks after Lennie and Lennie looks after George.  They plan to pool their money and buy a small piece of land with a shack on it \\"an' live off the fatta the lan'.\\"  Of course an accident stands in their way. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully written book that can be read in a couple hours.  One special attraction for me - we just returned from a vacation in California - was the local color from California's agricultural valleys. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|After listening to \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" I have concluded that the magic is back and you can hear it in her voice. Forget about this being the best album in years, what about her best ever? Mariah doesn't have to go back and relive the 90's because she's created something much better with her current CD. I'm not looking to recapture her \\"glory days.\\" \\"Mimi\\" is a contemporary Mariah Carey masterpiece that showcases what her voice can do in a more contemporary setting. And she proves that she can keep up with the other girls and guys. The production is excellent. If every album was recorded as well as this one, CD's would be flying off the shelves. If you want to make a great album, people should be taking notes on this one. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is one of the high points of 2005. Just like Usher came out blazing with \\"Confessions\\" this time last year, Mariah is doing the same thing with \\"Mimi.\\" Interesting, they were both co-produced by Antonio \\"LA\\" Reid. Although, the big difference being Mariah's famous voice accompanied by her signature style of song. This is a noteworthy comeback because she didn't have to compromise the style or integrity of her songs just to fit in. Somehow it just works even 15 years later. Very few will be able to say that. That makes it even more dazzling that Mariah can just jump back in without us ever noticing that she had left. Now the universe is starting to feel balanced once again. There hasn't been a female to top the Billboard 200 since last year. That's right folks, 2004 was the last time. Mariah would be the first female of 2005 to claim the #1 spot next week. That would be miracle. So don't underestimate what this might mean for her. I would continue to support this great record. Mariah did an amazing job. Help her get to #1.
1400032717|5.0|What a stunning book. Told in first-person by an autistic 15 year old boy, the story is touching and humorous, without being pretentious or artificial in any way. Even incidents such as fits or soiling oneself are told in a stark, real manner that its hard to do anything but feel awe at the journey of the hero of the book. The book is more or less a murder mystery which masks the real issues at hand. The final chapter left me speechless and the closing passages are truly a source of wonder. It makes me rethink my evaluation of the English language as less than sophisticated than say French, which is oh-so-eloquent. But the author has proven that even with a limited vocabulary and short, concise sentences, it is possible to create a masterpiece of unparalleled merit. Truly unique, and never boring, 'The Curious Incident of the dog in the Night-Time' is a book that your collection needs. A very deserving receipient of the Whitbread Award, I might add. If you liked this, please also do pick up Christopher Nolans' 'Under the Eye of the Clock', which also won that prize and is similarly effective. Five stars all around.
0671004107|5.0|I recently re-read this book and was again impressed with Dr. Sagan's attention to detail and work. I am an astrophyscist and his work and research inspire many of us who deal in theoretical issues that this book deals with.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Even though I think the CD is good (at least better than the last two disasters) I personally think she's imitating Beyonce to the most!!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|According to the band, the album was supposed to be 5 tracks, but due to 5 tracks legally being an EP (not familiar with that), they had to cut Cassandra Gemini up into 8 tracks, tracks that are strangely NOT divided upon section lines.    The tracklisting should read as follows (track times approximate):    1) Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus (13:02)  2) The Widow (5:50)  3) L'Via L'Viaquez (12:21)  4) Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore (13:09)  5 - 12) Cassandra Gemini (32:32)    If at all possible, use a program to combine Cassandra Gemini into one track, because that is the way it was meant to be experienced.    As for the album, I find it quite immaculate. As one of the few modern rock bands I enjoy, the Mars Volta have more than delivered on Frances the Mute. It's truly an epic; as overblown and arty as it wants to be while still finding time to rock (among other genres). Top of the line stuff here.
0385513755|5.0|This book is really great. I wasn't going to read it but i figured what the heck everyone else is so i might as well see what they are talking about and it was a fun read. As for reviewer RYAN, to put down someone's writting skills is one thing and if you don't like the story that is your opinon but to say someone or their wife is a lesbian is going to far, that was one of the worst things you could say i did report it and hopefully Amazon will cancel your accound and remove the post. It really was horrbile to say. As for the other bad reviews I must say i find them pretty amusing they must be some of those tent revival church people you know the type that bite the heads of live chickens or something during the service. people it's okay to hate the book but lets not get the views of your faith involved okay?
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Mariah Carey has been around since the dawn of the 90's. She entered the decade with a bang, selling over 9 million copies of her debut album in the U.S. alone,spawning 4 number 1 singles, and nabbing two Grammy's at the same time. Since then she's topped the charts multiple times, racking up more accumulative weeks at number one on billboard charts and breaking more records than I have fingers. Yet when 2001 rolled around and she had a few hits that weren't number one, but sold as well as the average artist, and a movie that didn't do as well as the public had expected, she's labeled as a fallen diva? When artists like Madonna have had numerous flops, music and movie wise, and no one labels her as a fallen star. The fact is, Mariah is the number one selling female artist in history and her album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" reminds everyone why. Each and every song on this album is timeless and quite a few can be considered classic. Ballads with an old school, 70's feel, such as \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\" I Wish You Knew,\\" showcase the singer/songwriters powerhouse vocals as well as her soft, sensual falsetto in a controlled yet natural manner that is sure to make you feel like you're going through exactly what she's going through in each piece of music. Other songs that will get your fingers snapping,hips swaying, and send those tingly feelings up your spine; you know the ones Mariah can only make you feel,  are tracks like \\"Say Somethin',\\" \\"Get Your Number,\\"  \\"Your Girl,\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\" which has Mariah singing in  full voice, and in a very high register. Every song on the album is single material and despite the fact that there will be people who criticize this album, saying things like \\"I'm sick of her hitting those high notes,\\" and \\"I'm tired of her baby whispers,\\" the fact of the matter is, no other singer can sing with the style that Mariah has crafted to perfection. Wannabe replacements such as Beyonce' and Christina Aguilera may be talented and have attempted to copy the diva's style, but they are both nowhere near the vocal or songwriter level that Mariah is at. The truth is, no one gives Ms. Carey the credit she deserves. She came onto the scene writing all of her own material and still does, unless she does a cover song. She produces, and she sings far superior than any other singer, and with a range that makes the diva's before her, such as Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan, jealous. This album should once and for all silence everyone who has something negative to say about this talented woman who has shaped the history of popular music forever and set a standard that no singer, new or old, will ever be able to surpass. She was never gone from the spotlight, she just decided to share it for a short while. So please, call this album genius, call it a masterpiece, call it whatever you will, but do NOT call it a comeback. She's been here all along.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD was really good. The songs are all good and if you liked her last album, youll probably like this one too. <br />The best songs are Dont Tell me,My Happy Ending,He Wasnt,Take Me Away,Forgotten,and Nobodys Home. All the songs are good I just thinkl those are the best. Shes the Alanis Morissette of her generation. You should get this CD if you like Alanis or Avril.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This, along with all of Sigur Ros' music makes the world a more beautiful place. It is calming, meditative, inspiring music that, rather than hinders and channels thought, promotes and evokes individual perception and idea. <br /> <br />Medically speaking (I'm not a doctor) it slows the heart rate and calms. <br /> <br />For the student: Listen to this before an exam or presentation-I guarantee a better grade. <br /> <br />Agaetis Byrjun, in my opinion, is the most consistently solid album of Sigur Ros to date. It's amazing. <br /> <br />If you are ever feeling anxious, put this on and close your eyes. You'll be brand new after one song (namely Svefn g englar).
B0007P3582|5.0|This CD was actually really good even though some people have been saying it isn't. Its really good. I can listen to every song on here. I really like A Baltimore Love Thing, its really good. Candy Shop,Disco Inferno,and Just A Lil Bit are all great,which you've probably heard on the radio. There's a song with Jamie Foxx and its really great too. I like all the songs on the CD. I think if you loved Get Rich you'll definately enjoy The Massacre.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Ok..Everyone was expecting things to go back into the early 90's. Everyone was expecting Mariah to step back into time and bring back all the high pitched notes and strong vocals. They wanted her to hult her life and freedom of feeling free and chose songs that are cookie cutter types. They wanted Vision of Love, Hero, and Never Forget you types of songs. Yet, time moves on and things change. You change and I change so its a fact that Mariah is going to change her music style.  <br /> <br />So lay off, if you can not just support her in the change then you were really not a fan to begin with. I didn't like the direction she was going in but I learned to deal with it and learned to like it. I do love it now, I do believe that anything Mariah does is great.  <br /> <br />The songs she is singing is what she feels like sing. Her past attempt of more R&B were really not well taken in but, I do believe that she has finaly mastered what she was trying to get across in Rainbow and Charmbracelet. This album is one of the best I have heard in years from Mariah. She does take it back to early years. She is not doing it over the top but it really classy and tastful. She makes every song her own and put a stamp of greatiness on it. This album lets everyone know that she is doing what she wants. So this album is really the best it could be. <br /> <br />To everyone who really does not like this album or says this is not her best. I would say stick to J. Lo, Britney, Beyonce, and others just like them. Mariah is moving on and so are we. We meaning the fans who actually love Mariah in whatever she does in her career.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I first started liking Mariah when I heard that song Sweetheart with JD. I've liked her ever since. However,I did not purchase Glitter or Charmbracelet. I did enjoy the movie Glitter though. I also enjoyed all her singles I heard also. Now she's at it again with Its Like That and We Belong Together. These songs are great this CD is also really good. My favorites are Its Like That,We Belong Together,Shake It Off,Get Your Number,One And Only,and To The Floor. If you like Mariah you'll enjoy this CD.
B000022TSW|5.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done it, adapting the hit show onto the big screen in hillarious fashion. This movie has obviously set out to shock yet entertain at the same time, and it succeeds quite well. A definitive must for any fans of the series, and for anyone who is a fan of this type of comedy as well. Like some comedies before it [Animal House, Blazing Saddles etc.], this is a major guilty pleasure. Surprisingly though, as disgusting and tasteless as it is, you can't help but shed tears of laughter upon viewing  more than a few scenes.  <br /> <br /> This is surprisingly a very well made movie, with one of the funnier scripts in decades. Like I said, if you are a fan of South Park or Comedy Central in general, then you'll likely enjoy it more than others, but, with the exception of kids, this is a movie almost everyone can laugh at. It has something to offend everyone. The kids of South Park have just discovered R rated 'cuss epics' ala Terrence & Phillip of Canada. After sneaking in and seeing the movie, the kids have their language issues and the parents are appalled to find their children using some very vulgar terms. Soon, an all out war insues between the parents of South Park and America against Canada itself. This film however has a nice, touching ending, and Stone and Parker have proved that this is not just a publicity stunt, but a very respectable, funny film. Once again, keep it safe and locked from the children, but enjoy it all the same for yourself.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I can defintely recommend \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\", it is better than MCR's previous release, regardless if your turned off by the genre or maybe your little sister is listening to it, give it a try. Unlike most of the screamo type of music, there is alot going on in this collection of songs, the singers voice is great and if you find yourself liking \\"Helena\\" then I can gaurantee you will like the rest of this CD, I can listen through the whole thing without a problem, except there is an interlude song that is ok to skip :P. My favorites on this album are Helena and Ghost of you, try it out, you will not be disappointed.
1591396190|5.0|The authors looked at the business launches of 108 companies, and found that those which emphasized serving competitively uncontested customer needs were only 14 percent of the cases.  Yet those \\"blue ocean\\" launches accounted for 61 percent of the total profits (or almost 10 times as many profits on average per launch as those who went after \\"red oceans,\\" where competitive space is already served).<br /><br />Rather than examining the processes that companies used to create these wins, the authors investigated the common strategic elements of the \\"blue ocean\\" cases they found, and developed a strategic planning process designed to focus on those elements.  In the last 15 years, they have experimented with that process with a number of consulting clients and now report the results of their latest refined process.<br /><br />They propose four principles formulate a strategy:<br /><br />1. Reconstruct market boundaries<br /><br />2. Focus on the big picture, not the numbers<br /><br />3. Reach beyond existing demand<br /><br />4. Get the strategic sequence right.<br /><br />They also propose two principles to implement strategy:<br /><br />5. Overcome key organizational hurdles<br /><br />6. Build execution into strategy.<br /><br />For applying each of the strategic principles, the authors describe different paths and steps, and provide simple, analytical tools designed to be applied in a back-of-the-envelope analysis.<br /><br />1.  Reconstruct market boundaries<br /><br />Paths for this part of the process include looking across functional substitutes from other industries, different segments within an existing industry, different linked sets of buyers and buying influencers, complementary offerings, availability of functional versus emotional appeals, and extend the time perspective for a longer period.  The key tool for this analysis is a simple strategy canvas that documents the areas where offerings have characteristics and whether the characteristics are positioned to be \\"high\\" or \\"low.\\"  Examples of this analysis abound.<br /><br />2.  Focus on the big picture, not the numbers<br /><br />This part of the process comes in four steps:<br /><br />a. Draw a strategy canvas (as described above) to see where change is needed<br /><br />b. Directly observe customers and stakeholders being affected by current offerings<br /><br />c. Have senior executives propose alternative strategy canvas solutions and pick a winner<br /><br />d. Share the resulting strategy canvas to everyone and test it for implementation feasibility.<br /><br />3.  Reach beyond existing demand<br /><br />You investigate specifically the needs of those who are about to stop buying in the existing industry, those who reject the existing offerings already, and noncustomers who buy now from markets distant from yours.<br /><br />4.  Get the strategic sequence right<br /><br />You carefully check out the resulting idea in this order:<br /><br />a. Does it add lots of new customer value (in terms of purchase, delivery, use, supplements, maintenance and disposal relative to customer productivity, simplicity, convenience, risk, fun and image, and environmental friendliness)?<br /><br />b. Can most buyers afford the price?<br /><br />c. Can you make a profit at that price?<br /><br />d. Can you overcome the adoption challenges?<br /><br />Blue Ocean Strategy converts into a discussion of implementation challenges from chapter 7 on, emphasizing \\"tipping point leadership\\" (refocusing attention, shifting resources from ineffective to effective areas, and gaining credibility); \\"fair process implementation\\" (involvement by employees and stakeholders rather than being treated like objects); putting up barriers to imitation; and repeating the process.<br /><br />As you can see, this is a process-intensive \\"how to\\" book rather than a conceptual book, although the authors have chosen a powerful metaphor that helps offset the B-School diagrams and new terms and phrases.<br /><br />The authors seem to be consciously trying to create a simpler, alternative version of Professor Michael Porter's classic, Competitive Strategy that excludes a focus on the classic simple strategies of more value, lower price or greater closeness to customers (see The Discipline of Market Leaders).<br /><br />I found the book to be a close parallel to Professor Christensen's latest book for technology company innovation, Seeing What's Next, except Blue Ocean Strategy is intended to apply mostly to nontechnology companies.  Both offer theories of an innovation process that they feel could work and early experiences with the process.<br /><br />Both approaches remind me of the beginnings of reengineering.  In fact, I renamed this book \\"Reengineering the Business Model\\" in my mind.  I hope the experience with this process will be better than what followed from reengineering.<br /><br />By contrast, I would like to humbly suggest that future researchers consider monitoring and examining instead the business model innovation processes of those who repeatedly introduce new business models that combine higher value, lower prices and reduced costs.  I was shocked to see that such innovators were largely ignored in this book in favor of writing about cases where a single major business model innovation occurred in an organization.<br /><br />If the authors had studied these examples (which have been described in the strategy literature since 1992), they would have discovered that business-model innovation of the sort they describe is more often driven by bottom-up sources and experiments rather than the top-down planning they support.  As a result, I believe that their process will turn out to be relatively unproductive compared to the existing best practices in business model innovation.<br /><br />As a result of that oversight, I concluded that this book will have its primary value for:<br /><br />1.  Entrepreneurs who are beginning to formulate a business model for a start-up and<br /><br />2.  Consultants who want a new service to sell to large companies who don't understand business model innovation.<br /><br />I also have some quibbles with the scholarship behind the book.  The key study for validating the superiority of Blue Ocean strategies isn't footnoted to a source and there is no documentation of the methodology, the sample used, the measurements or anything else that allows a reader to check out the conclusions.<br /><br />Facts were frequently misstated or overstated in the beginning, once even contradicting the authors' own footnotes (saying that In Search of Excellence was published 20 years ago on page 9 while a footnote correctly states the publication date as 1982).  Another example is the authors stating that the mutual fund industry was not a multibillion dollar industry in 1975 (really? -- I don't think so), nor were coffee bars a big business (the authors teach in Europe where coffee bars have been a huge business for many decades), and discount retail was not large then (ever heard of Wal-mart, Kmart, Levitz Furniture, etc.?).<br /><br />For me, the best part of this book came in a few new cases that I wasn't familiar with before such as Curves (fitness salons for women), NovoLet (preloaded insulin injection pens), NABI (more durable, less costly to maintain buses), the Joint Strike Fighter (one platform customized for each branch of the U.S. military), and i-mode (Internet access on a cell phone in Japan).

B00005JKJA|5.0|Many of the reviews on this site come from people who either say, \\"Can someone explain this movie to me, because I totally didn't get it\\" or \\"Gosh, it was so pretentious and egocentric\\" or \\"wtf was going on\\" or \\"I got lost half way through the film and I don't really care.\\"   <br /> <br />While I concede that the film is difficult to understand on its first viewing, it's certainly not impossible to understand.  It takes time, and it REALLY makes you think about it.  Don't watch it if you like mindless movies, because this one will make you think.  It is best described as the movie version of a Rubix Cube....there are many interpretations, and just finding one of them is a v. rewarding feeling.  This is what movies should be about!   <br /> <br />Other than that, the cinematography of this movie is really well-done.  Gorgeous and lush and spooky and eerie all at the same time.  Editing and music and other technical stuff are also excellent; they do a fantastic job of building suspense.  I nearly jumped out of my seat multiple times, and it wasn't just the image...it was the build-up and suspese to that image.  Acting is superb...this is a real standout performance by Naomi Watts.  She really knocks it out of the park, and was robbed of an Oscar nomination that year.   <br /> <br />If you love movies that make you think, you'll love this film.   <br />
B000002IST|2.0|Okay... <br /> <br />I have to say, the first time I ever heard of Genesis was \\"That's All\\" and \\"Illegal Alien\\".  <br /> <br />Even when Phil Collins \\"No Jacket Required\\" became such a monster hit in the mid 80's along with \\"Invisible Touch\\", I wasn't a big fan, I just liked the music. <br /> <br />It was when I bought albums like \\"Genesis\\", \\"Duke\\" and even \\"Abacab\\" that I had realized that this band had an incredible sound. <br /> <br />So when \\"We Can't Dance\\" came out, I was excited due to the song \\"No Son of Mine\\", but was really let down by songs like \\"I can't Dance\\", that stupid song about evangilists. But the only reason I have this CD in my collection is the song \\"Driving The Last Spike\\".  <br /> <br />This song is a very incredible song that moves me evertime I hear it. <br /> <br />It is a song that will be lost in an album full of nothing. It is too bad that it is on such horrible album that basicly sounds like a Phil Collins solo album being played by Mike and the Mechanics. <br />
B00005JKES|4.0|I really enjoyed watching season 1.  I never saw it when it originally aired, but my friends all loved it, so I bought the season \\"sight-unseen.\\"  Well, I've been waiting and waiting for season 2 and it appears there will never be a season 2 on DVD.  I would never have bought season 1 if I'd known that I'd never be able to watch season 2...  :(
B0007WZUMO|3.0|My initial assessment of the fourth NIN studio album in 15 years is that it's not bad, but that it will immediately trigger wails of disappointment from fans who perhaps expect too much of Trent Reznor. The most notable thing about the new album is that Reznor doesn't really cover any new ground. It's another collection of the same angsty industrial-metal stuff he's done all these years. On this album, he's recording with a full band instead of being essentially a solo studio project, but otherwise you pretty much get just what you expect here. <br /> <br />It's possible that Reznor is and has always been overrated to a certain degree. Nine Inch Nails debuted at a time when music fans as a whole were looking for something new in the 90's, and so it was fresh to most ears and people overreacted as they tend to do when they hear something new that kicks their butts to a sufficient degree. But I think NIN has always been a good band with a knack for scoring great singles, not a great band overall. Still, it's this perception that NIN is in fact a GREAT band that has led people to have too-high expectations of each new album, followed by the requisite disappointment. <br /> <br />Reznor certainly wasn't any kind of industrial pioneer. What he had (and still has) was a gift for putting what are essentially traditional pop and rock tunes to an industrial arrangement and finessing the whole thing so that it has commercial accessibility. The hilarious Devo cover of \\"Head Like a Hole\\" pretty much affirms that any pop band, even a goofy one, can pull off an NIN song.  <br /> <br />On \\"With Teeth\\" Reznor does this all over again, giving us loud and angry music that, F-words aside, students could still dance to at the prom. Some of this is fantastic. \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is a great, simple dance anthem. I also really like the album's opener, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" in which he does the same thing more or less as he did in \\"March of the Pigs,\\" starting quiet then getting loud, expect this time it's a gradual build-up instead of an abrupt blast of noise. But the new song has interesting lyrics in which the singer assesses his miserable life and then contrasts it with an unseen other person who seems to have it all together. \\"Why do you get all the love in the world?\\" goes the endlessly repeated refrain, and there's a growing sense of menace and resentment each time it's sung, making the song lyrically comparable to something like Peter Gabriel's \\"Family Snapshot\\". <br /> <br />On other tracks like \\"You Know What You Are?\\" Reznor is just covering territory he already covered better in songs like \\"Starf**kers Inc.\\", though having a real band cut loose does give the song some authority. But then a new problem Reznor faces here is that since \\"The Downward Spiral\\" there has been a decade of nu-metal screamer bands who have stolen most of that loud-guitar thunder, and NIN doesn't steal it back so much as join their ranks. <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is an average effort with a few killer songs, and perfectly in keeping with the NIN canon. And it will probably be flamed by people who have this idea Reznor is supposed to be more of a genius or innovator than he actually is.
B000002H70|5.0|I am a rock fan that listens to everything from heavy metal to alternative pop to classic rock and everything in between.    Distintegration is without a doubt the greatest rock CD ever.  All the songs are incredible.  It transports you to another world.    Your life will not be complete until you own this CD.
B000001ELD|4.0|Was Gene Simmons a demon? I don't think so. You know, when you're with your friends in a group of 3 or more, you do things you won't do alone or with only one person like shouting weird things out loud in a public zone... Well, Gene is like everyone of us, the only difference is that when he's in group, he spread fire and blood. But when he's alone, we can recodnize the professor who was teaching 5 languages before goin' into Kiss. This record is way more mature than his \\"Blood Sex n' Booze\\" songs with Kiss. When The four members had the idea of makin' the solo albums, it was tho occasion Gene was seekin' to make songs he loved but that weren't well fit for Kiss. Altought, there's a song to avoid Kiss fans to be left-off: Radioactive. This songs is pure rock n' fun. Maybe a bit repetitive but very cool. Other gems here are See You Tonite, a more melodic number, Man of a 1000 faces, a song that recalls me the Rolling Sones' \\"2000 Man\\" and Mr. Make Beleive, another ballad. <br /> <br />OVERALL: It's not the album you'll listen to everyday, but it's cool and enjoyable. Lacks a good production but still it could be worse, songwriting motivation wasn't at his best but few gems were born andfor the singing, well, it's Gene Simmons!
B0007MVXQG|5.0|First of all, I've heard people say that the Dual-Disc version of AOR gave them problems. So farI haven't experienced any problems at all, the cd plays fine in my cd player. Well anyway, let me say that the Priest is back together and better than ever. AOR is one of my favorite Priest albums along with Screaming for Vengeance and Defenders. My favorite songs on AOR are Deal With the Devil, Hell Rider, Judas Rising, and Demonizer. If you like the Priest, buy this album today.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This was the most anticipated album and it really just SUCKED. I really loved Get Rich or Die Tryin and couldnt wait to buy The Massacre. This album is just overhyped and overrated garbage. A huge dissapointment...    1. Intro- Holy Sh**, what the hell is this... I love gunfire ova a track but WTF iz this    2. In My Hood- This was a pretty good song. The beat is ghetto and it has pretty good lyrics, but what's wit tha saxaphone at the end of the song    3. This is 50- This is a great example of why this album is a dissapointment. I hate how he holds the last word of his line while he is rapping    4. Im Supposed to Die Tonight- A rare hot song. This song i was really feelin. Eminem blessed this song with the beat and the chorus is good. I like the gunfire they put on this song unlike the Intro    5. PiggyBank- WHat the hell is this Preschool sh**. I mean really.. \\"Clickity clank Clickty Clank Money in My piggybank\\" WTF is that. This has to be the weakest diss i ever heard in the history of hip-hop. MAD HOT BEAT. WEAK (...) LYRICS.    6.Gatman and Robin- OMG I hate this song. They try to make tha beat like Batman theme but itz just wak. 50 comes wit some weak weak weak lyrics. Eminem shows he got skills. You have to realize he is rappin to the beat and thatz gotta be tha one hardest beat to rap too.    7. Candy Shop- OMG where do i start with this song. I used to like this song but after about the 100th time i heard it i got a little sick of it. NICE LYRICS AND HOT BEAT. overall itz a pretty nice song.    8. Outta Control- THANK YOU. This song is straight FIYA. THE BEAT is crazy. i love that pounding type beat. The Lyrics are nice and the chorus is hot. OVverall i great song (But i aint really feelin that recycled line from Beg For Mercy and the way he ends that verse AND this a hot song but IT IS NO IN DA CLUB)    9. Get In My Car- The beat is annoying. Itz so repetive. The only thing good is the chorus. WEAK LYRICS. Tell me how many times has someone rhymed PU**Ywit Push me     10. Ski Mask Way- Other than the 1st line the lyrics are pretty wak. I love the chorus though. And i like what they do wit the beat at the end of the song. Overall itz a pretty a good song.    11. Baltimore Love Thing- This was a pretty nice song. This song definetly grew on me. i love the YOULL NEVER LIVE WITHOUT ME LINE. and the lyrics are nice especially when he cursin out the girl. and i really like the chorus. One of the best songs on the CD    12. Ryder Music- This aint Ryder Music. This Go to Sleep Music. I swear the weak lyrics and boring beat made me fall asleep when i heard this.     13. Disco Inferno- I like the beat but god how weak are these lyrics. DISCO INFERNO, LETS GO, YOU NOW ROCKIN WIT A PRO. his rhymes are so predictable    14. Just A Lil Bit- I dont know what to think about this song. I was listening and think the beat is hot until that Middle Eastern thing came on. 50 is trying to be creative with the music and is just wak. THE CHORUS ANNOYS THE HELL OUTTA ME    15. Gunz Come Out- Dre blessed the beat but 50 took the blessing and just crapped on it with lyrics (...). (PS why is 50 singin on every chorus in this song???)     16. My Toy Soldier- Give a round of aplause for Eminem. What a beat. And 50 does a pretty good job on lyrics and the hook is NICE... very nice. Yayo has a nice verse.    17. Position Of Power- I was cracking up when i heard the intro to this song. All you hear is 50 saying I GOT MONEY I GOT MONEY in some crazy (...) voice. Tha beat is nice and tha lyrics are pretty good. When you look at the chorus on paper it looks preety good. But when you hear it the flow is weak    18. Build You Up- HOT SONG. Jamie Foxx straight kills the chorus. GREAT BEAT but again weak lyrics    19. God Gave Me Style- No offense he sounds so (...)gay when he sings the chorus and what he sayin in the intro.  But i really love this song. The lyrics are great and i love the Beat. There are alot of quotable lines in this song.  QUOTE:Whenmy cds drop, they sell the best  You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed  QUOTE:I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell  If so what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell    20. So Amazing- Nice beat. Would make a good single. Olivia shows true talent on the hook. Alright lyrics. But how different does Olivia sound on this song and Candy Shop.    21. I Dont Need Em- Mad Gutta Beat. i really like it. Lyrics are pretty good and i love the chorus. i like hooks where the rapper curses out people. This song shows 50 is nothin to be played around wit    22. Hate it Or Love It- BEST SONG!!!! Crzy.. The reason this is the best song is because 50 doesnt rap on this track. He just recycles some sh*t he did wit Game. ( Lloyd Banks continues to amaze me)    SUMMARY: CLearly an hugely overrated dissapointment. Why does it seem he sings on almost all the song's hooks. ALSO, I was cracking up at the pics in the booklet. You see the one where he is pouring milk on the girl, AYO LOL..that pic was just plain stupid. Overall the lyrics are just weak. And i dont hear the hunger in 50 when he raps now. Power of The Dollar and Get Rich Or Die Tryin were classics. I dont know what this piece of crap is...
B00005KB9W|5.0|I'm not a reggae fan, but it doesn't prevent me from giving this album the 5-star rating it deserves. This is reggae at its best. Excellent recording quality and an excellent performance that will get anyone tapping their foot. Bob Marley's down-to-earth style never gets old and his energetic voice, coupled with some really nice percussion, a good groove, and backup vocals make this album a book you can't put down! Highly recommended.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|You have to get this CD!  In The Middle is such a good song!  I jsut saw these guys again at the Sky Show 2005 here in Manchester, and they kick ass!  Why they arent a bigger band I have no idea.  THey really rock!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I just bought this album today, and I must say that if you don't own it, you MUST. This entire album is terrific. Mariah gives us a little bit of everything: R&B, Soul, Pop, AC, even some Gospel...enough to please ALL of her fans. I can't stop listening to it. Everything is perfectly crafted and her voice is back and better than ever.  <br /> <br />I have always believed that Mariah is the best singer in the world. While this could be debated, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind. She puts so much emotion into everything she sings, and whenever she performs, she takes my breath away. Who can hit notes like her? She is a true star. <br /> <br />Personal favorites of mine on this CD include her newest single, \\"We Belong Together.\\" I'm also really feeling \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Stay the Night,\\" \\"Circles,\\" \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" and the Gospel-influenced \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" Mariah's voice is in top form again, and I'm so glad that she is back. I've been listening to her greatest hits album constantly for the last few years; I now have fourteen new Greatest Hits tracks to listen to. Buy this album and it will be worth every penny, guaranteed.
B00004XONN|4.0|Instead of simply adding club beats or sonic collage techniques, Radiohead strive to incorporate the unsettling \\"intelligent techno\\" sound of Autechre and Aphex Twin, characterized by its skittering beats and stylishly dark sonic surfaces, for Kid A. To their immense credit, Radiohead don't sound like carpetbaggers, because they share the same post-postmodern vantage point as their inspirations. As a result, Kid A is easily the most successful electronica album from a rock band -- it doesn't even sound like a rock band, even if it does sound like Radiohead. So, Kid A is an unqualified success? Well, not quite. Despite its admirable ambition, Kid A is never as visionary or stunning as OK Computer, nor does it really repay the time it demands. OK Computer required many plays before revealing the intricacies of its densely layered mix; here, multiple plays are necessary to discern the music's form, to get a handle on quiet, drifting, minimally arranged songs with no hooks. Of course, the natural reaction of any serious record geek is that if the music demands so much work, it must be worth it -- and at times, that supposition is true. But Kid A's challenge doesn't always live up to its end of the bargain. It's self-consciously alienating and difficult, and while that can be intriguing, it seems deeper than it actually is. Repeated plays dissipate the mystique and reveal a number of rather drab songs, where there isn't enough under the surface to make Radiohead's relentless experimentation satisfying. But mixed results are still results, and about half of the songs positively shimmer with genius.
6305841861|5.0|Out of the three i'd have to say this one takes the cake for the best as it is the one that best balances comedy and horror, farce and gore. Fantastic directing by Sam Raimi, who utilizes some really cool camera tricks throughout the movie. Utterly hilarious and gore filled(well, not as much as say...Dead Alive), sure it's not going to make you think in any way shape or form but it sure as hell is entertaining! And of course not to forget Bruce Campbell(who is the B movie man by the way). And another thing, this isn't a sequel to the first, more of a remake and be sure to see the first and the third as they are almost just as good.My rating: 9/10.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Using the textured soundscapes of The Bends as a launching pad, Radiohead delivered another startlingly accomplished set of modern guitar rock with OK Computer. The anthemic guitar heroics present on Pablo Honey and even The Bends are nowhere to be heard here. Radiohead have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured yet still has the feeling of rock & roll. Even at its most adventurous -- such as the complex, multi-segmented \\"Paranoid Android\\" -- the band is tight, melodic, and muscular, and Thom Yorke's voice effortlessly shifts from a sweet falsetto to vicious snarls. It's a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations. Yet all of this would simply be showmanship if the songs weren't strong in themselves, and OK Computer is filled with moody masterpieces, from the shimmering \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" and the sighing \\"Karma Police\\" to the gothic crawl of \\"Exit Music.\\" OK Computer is the album that establishes Radiohead as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar rock bands of the '90s.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Ok, i'll admit the first time I watched the movie I didn't think it as great as I do now, but I recently purchased it and have watched it several times afterwards and must say...this is one of those rare thrillers that in this day and age is daring,edgy,compelling and actually makes you think(whooooa). Daring in the way it's done, as it is all backwards, perhaps confusing watching it the first time around but after more viewings the pieces of the puzzle start to click. It still has its flaws I know, like how does he know about his condition? But then again, if he didn't there wouldn't be a story would there? Maybe i'm being a little pompous by saying this, but this may well be one of the best and most daring thrillers I have seen and should be watched and enjoyed by casual movie watchers and film buffs alike. My rating: 9.5/10.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is their best album. Sure OK COMPUTER probebly generated more buzz but this is where they reinvented anthemic rock.
B0007GAERG|5.0|1. It's Like That - Fun and catchy... leaked way before it was meant to be heard, and without any promotion it still became a very popular song. From this first song, you can tell the album will be amazing... and it is. Hot video, too.<br /><br />2. We Belong Together - Beautiful ballad, one of my favorites on this album. Like a mix between Butterfly and her more recent Charmbracelet stuff, perfect compromise (-not to airy like her CB album). And she looked GORGEOUS in that video too! &lt;3<br /><br />3. Shake It Off - This is the type of song that grows on you. Very fun song!<br /><br />4. Mine Again - This has to be my favorite song on the album. &lt;3 One of her best ballads since My All -- you can feel the emotion in this song and hear The Voice. This is what assures me that it is back. Much better than her Rainbow/Charmbracelet love songs, and it really displays her vocal abilities.<br /><br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg - Fun song, makes me think of Crybaby, although it's a bit different.. Snoop Dogg does it.<br /><br />6. Stay The Night - This DEFINITELY should have been the first single! Her voice sounds amazing, but it's a fun and catchy song. Very Honey-like, IMO.<br /><br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri - Fun tune, very catchy. JD sounds good in this one too, reminds me of Sweetheart.<br /><br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - Catchy chorus, could've been on the Charmbracelet album. Really sounds like The One... but then some Bliss mixed in.<br /><br />9. Circles - Old school/midtempo MC. It's a beautiful song, very relaxing.<br /><br />10. Your Girl - Sounds like a mix of Butterfly, Rainbow, Charmbracelet, and even a little Daydream -- came out well. Fun song, but The Voice is still recognizable.<br /><br />11. I Wish You Knew - The beginning sounded just like Yours on the Charmbracelet album, but there's a different live approach to it, which reminds me of her collaboration with Trey Lorenz on I'll Be There.<br /><br />12. To The Floor featuring Nelly - Fun song, nice tune.<br /><br />13. Joy Ride - Slow R&B, Charmbracelet-like.<br /><br />14. Fly Like A Bird - This is the classic Gospel-sounding Mariah. In the beginning it sounds like a Charmbracelet song, but towards the middle and end it reminds me of Make It Happen and her earlier songs. Mariah has always tried to get across some kind of message of hope on her albums (think There's Got To Be A Way, Make It Happen, Can't Take That Away, My Saving Grace & Through The Rain), and this would be it. Fabulous closure for the album.<br /><br />Charmbracelet was nice, but it wasn't the \\"comeback\\" that Mariah needed to get back at the top of the charts WHERE SHE BELONGS. The Emancipation, however, has been hailed as \\"the return of The Voice,\\" and it truly is. It seems like Mariah has returned to that free and fun Butterfly style, which was released right after she broke up with Tommy, and she finally allowed herself to sing about what she wanted to, how she felt, and really put her all into her music. In that same way, after the so-called breakdown, the not-so-successful release of Glitter and the death of her father, Mariah has again \\"emancipated\\" herself and stopped worrying about pleasing everyone, about satisfying the media, about controlling her image, about making a comeback, and just wrote and sang from her heart, yielding one of her most successful albums in years. Some have complained about her \\"inappropriate\\" use of the whistle register, but IMO, that gives this album the fun and carefree feel that she intended. Honestly, I think she makes a better use of the trick in this album than she did on Emotions, and this is easily her best album since Butterfly (which IMO, was her best ever). I love this album. &lt;3ke.    14. Fly Like A Bird - This is the classic Gospel-sounding Mariah.

B0006GAI6Y|2.0|I just saw the American version of Shall We Dance last night and unfortunately it was inferior to the Japanese original, Shall We Dansu,  in every way. First, there is the casting. Richard Gere is John, an estate attorney vaguely disatisfied with his rather dull, albeit lucrative job and suburban domesticity. Shohei Sugiyama is Koji, a man trapped in a life he hates. Gere's voiceovers show a man who needs a bit more fun and excitement in his life. Sugiyama's body language and facial expressions show a man in despair, unable to escape his repressive culture and the consequences of his own decisions. Gere learns to dance to have more fun in his life. Sugiyama learns to dance to liberate his soul. And Sugiyama is a far more talented actor than Gere. Not only are his motivations to learn to dance far more profound but his relationship with the female leads is much more complex. For instance, when Gere first sees Jennifer Lopez in the window from his train he seems to be thinking \\"Hey, that's a nice-looking woman\\". When Sugiyama first sees Mai Kishikawa you can see the electricity pass between them. He sees another tormented soul and is immediately drawn to her.  <br /> <br />This brings me to the next point of casting, the main female lead. Jennifer Lopez is a reasonably talented actress and is attractive enough but brings nothing to the role that any attractive, talented actress couldn't have brought. She is clearly an actress who learned to dance for a role, rather than a dancer first. Mai Kishikawa is much more authentic as Tamiyo. She has the look and the grace of a natural dancer, which Lopez simply lacks. I never believed Lopez's Paulina could be a world-class competitive dancer while Tamiyo is wholly believable. Also, Paulina comes across as a woman getting over a long-time relationship that ended badly while Tamiyo is a woman devastated at the apparent destruction of a life-long dream. In the Japanese version both principal leads are motivated by an emptiness intheir soul while in the American version they are just bored and a little lonely. Totally different. <br /> <br />The third character, the wife, also shows the difference in the two films. In the Japanese version, she is a lonely, repressed housewife forced to hire detectives because she feels unable to confront her cold, distant husband over his strange behavior. Her emotionally repressive culture simply won't allow her to deal with him directly. Susan Sarandon's wife, on the other hand, is a gregarious, highly succesful executive. Her befuddlement at her husband's abscenses simply made no sense. Why not just ask him rather than spend thousand of dollars on investigators? I didn't buy her behavior at all. <br /> <br />This brings me to the whole cultural context of the film. Shall We Dansu portrayed Japan as an emotionally repressed place where husbands are unable to publically (and even privately) show affection for their wives and where learning to dance is considered unmanly. Koji's secrecy makes sense here. This simply isn't true of contemporary America. My wife, an immigrant and a very astute observer of culture, asked me as soon as the movie was over \\"Why didn't Richard Gere just take his wife out dancing?\\". I had no good answer. The difference is even clearer in the character of the coworker who secretly loves Latin dancing. In the Japanese version he wears a wig both to hide his own identity and to take on a wholly new one. In the American version the wig just becomes a ridiculous prop. Why was he so ashamed to let his coworkers know he danced? The scene where they made fun of him didn't ring true at all. <br /> <br />Shall We Dansu, then, had a far more talented cast and was a much more interesting investigation of culture than Shall We Dance. I challenge you not to feel joy in your heart after watching it. Save your money and skip this disappointing remake.

I have given copies of this book to almost all my friends(including many Christians and Jews). <br /> <br />We are living in crazy times, and it is only through embracing the central message of this book (that we need to abandon the notion of accepting claims without evidence) that we can be less anxious about a bleak future.

B000003TA4|1.0|This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.   <br /> <br />How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana \\"saved rock n roll\\"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!  It felt good to listen to!  Life was good!  But then in 1992 along came Nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music, and rock was never really the same again.  Everybody was miserable.  Nobody had any fun any more.  If a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time, then that band was \\"cheesy\\" and \\"stuck in the 80s\\".  Stuck in the 80s???  Well, if making music for entertainment purposes only, and not using it as an outlet to whine about your personal problems is an \\"80s\\" thing to do, then the 80s is where I want to stay!  <br /> <br />Grunge makes you feel like killing yourself.  In the 90s I used to like grunge, and I went through a period of severe depression.  But in '99 I took all my Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains CDs and I burned them!  And then I spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock bands!  And my depression instantly disappeared!  I was finally happy for the first time in 3 years, and I owe it all to ditching my grunge CDs.  <br /> <br />I don't recommend Nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody.  Grunge is the most depressing music in the world, and basically just encourages you to hang yourself.  It causes depression and suicide!  Don't poison your mind with this morbid garbage!  Stay away from grunge!
B00005JMFR|5.0|The film picks up from where The Matrix Reloaded left off and continues to shed light on Neo and his quest to save humanity.  The \\"mother of all battles\\" awaits and this time it all comes to an end... <br />Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again. <br />The plot, the setting, the SPECIAL EFFECTS, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  The Matrix Revolutions is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.   <br />In conclusion, the Matrix Trilogy, as a whole, is one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
0743454537|5.0|You can read all the brief summaries of the book but the thing I like the best about this book is the characters.  You think you know them at one point but they evolve and grow and you discover what each one is hiding.  My favorite characters are Campbell Alexander with his service dog and Anna, who you discover is not selfish but selfless.  The book contains a lot of humor with a very morose subject.  I loved Campbell's reasons for his service dog from \\"I have SARS and he's counting the people I infect\\" to \\"I'm a lawyer - he chases ambulances for me.\\"  Jesse is a problem but he also loves his sisters dearly.  He's a lost soul.  THe mom isn't as heartless as she seems and the dad is trying to keep them all together.  It's a unique read and I highly recommend it.  The ending is shock but I think it's the best possible one.
B00005B6ML|5.0|If you like courtroom dramas, you will love this.  In addition to a large, star-studded cast including American and British actors and actresses, the performances are uniformly marvelous, the script is taut and of full of meaning, without being one-sided. <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed by the performance of a young Anthony Hopkins. A tortured soul, you feel alternately repulsed and sorry for him, because in his situation you might very well have done the same thing.  It is one of the most moving performances I have ever seen on film. <br /> <br />This is a film to be relished over and over.  It is profound.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann's latest movie is a thrill ride.  This is a film noir as dark streets of Los Angeles gives the film a kick.  Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance as Vincent, a gun for hire looking to kill 5 witnesses for a drug kingpin.  Unlike Cruise's previous films which makes him a meek or sexy character, this performance gives him a complete package.  Mean, Cold, Vicious.  Jamie Foxx gives another outstanding preformance as Max, the taxi driver along for the ride.  His character is complex but develops into a bold and straightforward individual.  I found it interesting that the Academy put Foxx performance in the supporting role rather than lead acting.  It would not have surprised me if he would have been considered for Best Actor with this performance.  I felt it was just a good as his groundbreaking performance in \\"Ray\\".  This is a powerful and action packed film.  Very much recommended!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Mixed with mystery, drama, comedy, sex, romance, twists and turns, and enough soap to fill up a washing machine, ABC's newest sensation, \\"Desperate Housewives\\", is a incredible throwback to the popular nighttime soaps of dramas of the 1980's(of which I was too young to really watch or know about). It embraces those old shows' conventions with open arms and has a blast in doing so. The show was described so interestingly, that I thought I would check it out. When I watched the pilot episode, you couldn't help but be hooked. Taking place on Wisteria Lane(which is a very popular backlot at Universal Studios), the show is about a small group of housewives who get closer when one of their own commits suicide. Susan(Teri Hatcher), is a single mother and works as an illustrator. She is the heart of the group, and a bit of the \\"Lucy\\" as well. She instantly tries to get the attention of Mike DelFino(James Denton), a plumber who just moved onto the street. Then there is Lynette(Felicity Huffman), married to Tom(Doug Savant), and a mother of 4 who gave up her executive job to become a stay home mom. A mom who most can identity with. Harried and stressed out, Lynette is always interesting to watch. Bree(Marcia Cross), is a Stepford/Cleaver type housewife. She has perfectly coiffed red hair, clothes that sparkle, and polished house that would make Martha Stewart jealous. It's no wonder her husband Rex(Steven Culp), and kids Andrew and Danielle, have issues with her. Gabrielle(Eva Longoria), is the youngest of the lot. Beautiful and sexy, Gabrielle married the wealthy Carlos Solis, and basically lives in the lap of luxury. And the lap of her 18 year old gardner John(Jesse Metcalfe). Then there is Edie(Nicolette Sheridan), who isn't a housewife. She's the street vixen, a real estate agent on the prowl. Hey, it's Nicolette Sheridan. Narrating the show is Mary Alice Young, the housewife who kills herself. She is played and voiced by Brenda Strong(who also has a recurring role as another dead wife on \\"Everwood\\". Who's her agent?. Death?). The season sets up a number of mysteries. Why did Mary Alice kill herself?. What does her creepy husband Paul(Mark Moses) know?. What is Mike's real story?. Believe me, there is more to it than this. The show has more twists and turns than a California coastal road. Creator Marc Cherry has created a wonderfully twisted and funny show, with deeply complex and fleshed out characters. It also helps that the cast of women(and the guys)are exceptional actors who truly bring each and every character to life and to it's fullest potential. The show and it's many themes and plot twists aren't always as solid as they want to be. For the most part they are, but sometimes it seems as if Cherry and the writers are thinking some stuff up as they go along, and sometimes feels as if things are a bit too crazy. Then again, that's the nature of these kinds of shows. To be juicy, gossipy, and create unheard of situations. It is part soap, after all. But not everything on Wisteria Lane is just about the ongoing mysteries. It's also about life. Day to day life of these women, and their hassles and struggles. With a little murder, suicide, and sex thrown in for good measure. Hatcher really deserves the success she is getting, and she has proven to be the right person for this role. Huffman is exceptionally good as Lynette, and deserves and Emmy. Equally as good is Cross. With trying to be June Cleaver and having her world and home life face issues and road blocks, Cross displays an incredible talent of showing this woman trying to figure out how to be and what to do. You can't rule out Longoria or Sheridan either. Both bring more character and depth to what some believe are just eye candy characters. They are so much more. Especially as the season progresses, Nicolette's character gets used a bit more and shows that there is much more to her than tight outfits and a constant lookout for available men. Jesse Metcalfe as John is justfine, but as the season goes along, there seems to be less and less use for his character to be there. It's also funny that the 26 year old Metcalfe is supposed to be 18. The show also included Lesley Anne Warren, who had a recurring role towards the end of the season as Hatcher's mother. Absolutely brilliant casting. With it's manicured lawns, immaculate homes, and Mayberry like innocence, Wisteria Lane is a beautiful area, but also shows that even the juiciest dirt, secrets, and lies, can lay under the most innocent of settings. DH is a welcomed treat every Sunday night. Let's hope it doesn't fly too far off the rails too soon.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|As a main stream, vampire/werewolf movie this was nice. <br /> <br />If they were trying to break some new ground here - sorry, they just didn't deliver. <br /> <br />The idea that werewolves and vampires both came from a common human ancester was a new idea but didn't really go anywhere. <br />They did lay some nice ground work for a second - and very likely superior - movie. <br /> <br />Worth watching once but not one I'd spend money on to own.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this CD on Tuesday and I think I have worn it out already lol. My favorite tracks are Its Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, Say Something, Stay The Night, Get Your Number, Your Girl, To The Floor and Joyride.
B00005JNTV|2.0|I had gone to the movies that evening, honestly, with relatively high expectations. Sin City had looked quite promising (stylistically, at least). The opening credits was the first step towards the the wrong path. Tacky, unsuitable for the flavor of the film, the text roled across the screen. At the mention of Michael Madsen, I perked up, hoping to see much of him since he was introduced as if he were a central character. The rest of the cast, mostly flashing in cheap film glory, was nominically impressive, but lacking in substance.    Marley Shelton slinked on a rooftop seductively as a dashing Josh Hartnett came up behind her, babbling trite, pulp nonsense. The dialogue, to use layman's terms, was corny and poorly executed.    Confusingly, the plot shifts to a timeworn and sparse good-cop who is played dryly by Bruce Willis (the role on him is ridiculously overdone like a dead horse beat to post-mortal exhaustion). We meet Madsen's Bob briefly, and are disappointed. Random violence ensues, and we catch our eye-full of the first event of castration, which occurs at repeatedly at random intervals throughout the film.    Again, the plot takes a drastic turn to a grotesque, yet terrifically portrayed (by Mickey Rourke) Marv, the epitomy of the city's grimy underbelly. Surprisingly, I recognize his angel-[...]girl from the teen movie, Slackers, in which she played a sweet, blond girl-next-door (she's put on pounds and years since). The story is played out rather absurdly. Yet, it is undeniable how chilling Elijah Wood's role as Kevin the cannibal is. The choreography is mediocre, but the gore is exceptional. Miller evidently relies on shock value to capture the audience.    Clive Owen is the next victim to Miller's lunacy. An actor who falls short of praise for Arthur and Closer, is frankly horrible in his role as Dwight, a random murderer. This reminds me of how horrendous Brittany Murphy is as she never fails to be. Benicio del Toro, on the other hand, was amazing asRafferty, and later the corpse's head.    The scene shot by Quentin Tarantino stands out painfully from the rest of the film. There is more spark and whimsy in his fight sequences and character interactions. Move over, Rodriguez. You're the wrong man for the job. Tar pits, dinosaurs, Rosario Dawson in disgusting clothes. Shooting, shooting, shooting. And a brilliant Michael Clarke Duncan. Finally, the resolution.    I am relieved when we return to Hartigan's (Willis) story. Madsen is back for the second and last time. Jessica Alba prances in leather pants. She is remarkably dumb and useless. Quite seriously, she is the character that stands out the least. The classic damsel in distress is too easy to play. Nick Stahl is refreshingly evil and rotten as (...)(if only he had won the fight..). Not to ruin the film (it does a fine job of that itself), but the old guy saves the girl, and yadda, yadda, yadda, he dies. Thank God it's over.    Now, what I really appreciated about the movie was the innovative style that was used in cinematography. Honestly, I expected to be more dazzled, but the undertaking was still admirable. A fair fraction of the acting was solid: Mickey Rourke, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro, and Michael Clarke Duncan. The cyclical pattern of narrative that occur at the beginning and end also added a nice touch.    My problems with this film were... numerous. First of all, Frank Miller should be Freud's patient. His obsession with castration is a little more than disturbing. Not to mention, all women were portrayed as hookers and strippers, with the exception of Shellie, the dumb waitress. Heroes were hard, jaded, imperfect characters. Now, after looking at Frank Miller, it is safe to say he is insecure in his masculinity which led him to create a world where the flawed man is noble and popular with ubiquitous sex-ham girls. Real women are topless, chaps-wearing [...]girls.    Rodriguez was far from the ideal director for the film. Tarantinowould have made a better choice. The whole atmosphere had a specious quality to it; though emulating pulp novels, it also seemed to unintentionally mock it. Mostly, the dialogue was horrible, if not laughable, because of the way it was approached: realistic and coldly serious. With the pop culture savy of Tarantino, the film would have been gracefully executed in a fashion that speaks to us of the dated aspects of the narrative, along with the modern spectacles, with a whimsical flare.    In conclusion, Sin City was poorly organized, poorly executed, and poorly acted. But all in all it's a good show if you like demeaning women and mindless violence. The novelty of Tarantino's brand of honest brutality has been completely tarnished by the clumsy hands of Rodriguez.
B0002O39A2|5.0|This is a great 1st recording by Khan. Prog-rock at it's early best. This is some of Steve Hillage'(Gong and solo)best work. If you like early progressive music that's guitar oriented you will not be disappointed.
B00006L83N|5.0|This is just great stuff- they are getting better, and better. Every album they put out (in my opinion) is better than their last-- A must buy for prog fans!!!!!

6305313687|5.0|American History X is a tragic story about the influencing lies of neo-nazism and white supremacey. derrick vineyard is a 20-something young man who has just been released from prison for maliciously killing a black man. his mission through out the entire movie is to show his younger brother the realities behind the lie that he's being fed by the skins that he hangs out with, and to hopefully teach through the mistakes that landed him in jail. the movie is very graphic but an accurate veiw of the neo-nazi way of life. i would recommend this to anyone. the story is powerful, the acting is believable, the cinematography is awesome(color for the present, black and white for the past, lots of symbolism that you have to watch the movie a few times to really understand.) and the message behind the movie is very clear: <br />\\"life is too short to be pissed off all the time.\\"-American History X
B00008OLYN|5.0|This is a GREAT album- Opeth does it again- Deliverance is my favorite album by Opeth because its more musically diverse than this- but you just cant go wrong here. Id Buy this again if i lost it!
B000003TAB|3.0|<br />The weird material (i.e. the songs many a pretentious yutz calls \\"experimental\\") are the most interesting songs on Incesticide. \\"Beeswax\\" \\"Mexican Seafood\\" and \\"Hairspray Queen\\" are my favorites off the album, as well as the Devo cover \\"Turnaround\\". \\"Sliver\\" and \\"Aneurysm\\" are the token songs most fit for radio play. Although, there's hardly any appeal to the opener of Incesticide (\\"Dive\\"); it's dull and sludgy without any personality to call its own. Go ahead and call that sound the essence of Grunge, but keep in mind that it doesn't have anything unique or creative to it.  <br />
B000001Y79|5.0|Up until \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream.  After the release of the song \\"Just a Girl\\", all of that changed.  It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.<br /><br />Back around 1995, when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani.  Her voice was excellent (has gone downhill since), and she just had an attractive energy about her.  She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.<br /><br />This album, Tragic Kingdom, was a masterpiece.  I can listen all the way through, without skipping a song.  Standout songs are, \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Happy Now\\", and \\"Different People\\".<br /><br />A must have!
B00005JM1F|1.0|I have yet to understand why so many people find this film amusing. Some have said that it was a modern day Animal House, and while I find Animal House uninteresting I think that is a serious dis to Animal House. I don't know it just seems that this movie continuously tries to be funny way to hard and ends up falling into a pile of its own crummy jokes. This movie is like a stitched together hybrid of every other \\"guy\\" film out there. I say guy film meaning, \\"hey lets put some girls chest on the screen and it'll be an instant hit.\\" Well atleast its seems to have a lot of special features, so when you get tired of the film you can watch those instead. This is probably the only bad rating on here for this film but man, I've watched it once and that was more than enough.
B0002OERI0|4.0|American Idiot isn't the album of the millenium or a breakthrough. But it's a strong effort nonetheless; very listenable. Decent amount of passion, thankfully not over-produced, catchy but not cliche melodies.  <br /> <br />My fellow over-forties: good music hasn't gone away at all. Two guitars, bass, drums, and vocals still works the way it did in the 60s. A ton of bands, including Green Day, are carrying the torch. This is a great album to listen to on Monday morning going to work or Friday afternoon starting the weekend.
B0006399FS|4.0|I think this is a great cd. There is one song I'm not to crazy about, Love and Peace or Else, but its fine by me. I listened to the record when I got it, and to my suprise, they're were 5 songs I heard that I liked better than Vertigo! Miracle Drug, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, and Crumbs From Your Table were the five. I can tell that they put a lot of effort into the first 9 songs on the record. If you like this album, I would strongly recommend buying the Joshua Tree album, and the U2 movie, Rattle and Hum.
B000002UB6|5.0|Let It Be is the Beatles' very last album, and one of their greatest. There are no songs on this album I dislike, though Dig It and Maggie Mae aren't even a minute long,. Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road are instant classics, and I've Got a Feeling is great too. In my opinion, Let It Be is up there with Sgt. Pepper's and Abbey Road, and any Beatles fan should get it.
B000001GPX|5.0|I would like to take exception to Mr. P. Fitton's review, of August 9, 2004, although it is very wittily written. I am a classical musician myself, and thought I was so familiar with Beethoven's 5th symphony, right through PDQ Bach's rendition, that nothing could ever surprise me again about this symphony. About a month ago, I was riding home from work in my car, and, upon turning on the local classical station, caught the last movement of Beethoven's 5th. By the last chords I was so moved that I was crying. I was staggered by the new depths that were revealed to me in this recording. The station announced that this was Kleiber's version with the Vienna Philharmonic, and I am just now ordering it as my \\"definitive\\" version. Mr. Fitton, I do believe that, indeed, you just do not \\"get it\\".
B00004YW6I|3.0|Although not surprising, it's rather ironic that an artist as groundbreaking and original as Harvey is getting a commercial and critical recognition for her most mediocre release. <br />This is not a bad album it contains good tracks ('Big Exit', 'Whore Hustler') and at time strokes an emotional chord ('We Float') but most of the time it sounds predictable and disturbingly catchy. Both lyrically and musically the album is far behind the level that most Harvey fans are use to and it's understandable that a lot of them alienated her for it.   <br />
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie for the last 15 years and it never gets old.  It is one that you can watch with the entire family and is still fun for all ages.  No need to go into much detail as everyone has covered that, just wanted to get my raiting in.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Apparently Richard Curtis has been listening to far too many ' silly love songs. ' How else to explain how the same writer could produce such classics as \\" Four Weddings And A Funeral \\", \\" Notting Hill \\" and the brilliant Britcom \\" Vicar of Dibley \\" Well, we all have our 'off days' and with the release of \\" Love Actually \\" Mr. Curtis seems to be having a very bad day indeed!     Lets be blunt though...I've rarely ever started a film with such high expectations and enthusiasm only to be, by the end of this movie, tearing out whats left of my once full head of hair and trying to remember where I'd left the key to the liquor cabinet. A more frustrating movie experience I don't think I've ever had! You would think that with all the acting talent that this film possess it would be a cake-walk. Just place Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant ( insert Brit thespian of your choice here please! ) and let the camera roll but, sadly, it looks as though someone inserted a tornado of a script here. For starters whoever deemed Hugh Grant, the poor mans Cary Grant, up to the task of playing the British PM should have his screen writers guild card taken away. In what can only be described as 'casting from Hell' Mr. Curtis developes a plot line concerning our randy single-minded PM and how he seems to be  \\" searching for love in all the wrong places. \\" Not only that but our misguided misanthropic PM even gets to grit his white teeth at the visiting President of the United States after our Commander-in-Chief makes an amorous advance toward a comely secretary. Smugly putting at risk many years of friendship and alliances simply due to Mr. Grant's getting his knickers in a twist over a rather average employee. The plot line is simply beyond ludicrous and, sadly, Mr, Curtis doesn't leave well enough alone.     Theres more plots, sub-plots and the like going on here then Carters got liver pills! Poor Colin Firth...reduced to playing a writer who after discovering his wife is cheating with his brother ( family affair anyone? ) moves to France, meets an extremely average looking Portugese housemaid and voila! Runs off to learn her language, then off to his local arpt. to find the nearest flight to Portugal. Where in a fit of amore' professes his love and asks her father for her hand in marriage. Isn't love wonderful!? Of course all these events take scarcely a few days.     God, there are so many truly insipid moments in this feature that I would have a difficult time conveying all of them but here dear reader is by far the silliest if not the most disingenuous. Liam Neeson playing a heart-broken widower ( is there any other? ) who is predictably depressed but after learning of his step-sons infatuation with a local school-girl is eager to help his young lad. Now all of this would be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the boy, a cute young 'un if there ever was one, is barely 10 yrs. old! How Mr. Curtis expects an audience to believe that even though his mother is barely laid to rest that our young man is simply far too much in love to bother with any feelings of loss and grieving is beyond me. In \\" Love Actually \\" apparently love is the only emotion our cast of Brits are required to feel, think or even give a moments thought of. All other emotions are simply brushed away as though they simply carry little if any importance. In fact Richard Curtis takes so many leaps of faith that any viewer would be wise to leave his/her common sense at the door when watching this movie. And I won't even bother to enlighten the reader as to how our young love-struck lad is able to artfully dodge a security heightened Heathrow police as he runs to tell his young paramour his true feelings. Its simply beyond awful when a writer of Mr. Curtis caliber needs to resort to 'cute' and 'precocious' to make a script work.    Getting down to brass tacks here's the problem. Ok, heres one problem but its a big one! I truly love \\" romantic comedies \\" but in \\" Love Actually \\" Richard Curtis gives the genre a huge black-eye. First, for any romantic comedy to work you truly must care about the folks on the screen and the drama that unfolds before our very eyes. We fully expect a few tense moments,  a few miscommunications and even a few misadventures but you enjoy these awkward moments in hopes of our young couples finding their very own ' happy ending. ' In \\" Love Actually \\" there simply wasn't one person I could not only empathize with but one character who gave me any reason to care. The characters were poorly developed, one-dimensional and even, for the most part, self-absorbed. Plot lines were beyond silly and forced characters into quickly contrived situations that seemed haphazard and convenient. Plus, the idea of wasting the acting talents of Alan Rickman, protraying the typical lecherous husband under going a bad case of mid-life crisis was beyond reproach. Fact is Mr. Rickman looked thoroughly bored by the whole mindless event and I can't say he wasn't the only one having those feelings. Overall, a total disappointment and one in which I felt showed this writer being not only creatively lazy but one in which he shows no real insight into the complexities of love. A shame but what's on to do? Meg Ryan, please come home...all is forgiven!
0767834739|5.0|This movie got straight to the action before any plot even started which made the movie even better.Most people judge this movie by saying it's stupid and not having any point,but people who love to have fun with action films,this is for you.It's fun,<br /><br />scary,and gets you going,and it doesn't have stupid love stories in it.
B00026W82U|5.0|Kings of Convenience's earlier outing \\"Quiet Is The New Loud\\" (which I had briefly reviewed, albeit anonymously) was the benchmark for all other artists who jumped into the \\"Nu Acoustica\\" bandwagon for its fresher and more contemporary approach to the folk-pop music of yore.  Now the trend seems to pass and some other bands may have fallen out, but even so, KoC still retain their individuality. <br /> <br />Though they may still churn out one pretty folk song to another, the KoC really never fail to enchant listeners.  And their recent CD \\"Riot On An Empty Street\\" reveals some few more delights.  The instrumentation is now more bold and varied than before as they employ other things such as trombones, trumpets, strings, different kinds of percussions, banjoes and a female guest vocalist (named Feist) in addition to guitars, pianos and of course their famed whispering harmonies.  And though there are a few upbeat tracks such as, notably \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" as well as \\"Love Is No Big Truth\\", (which can easily be transposed as electro-dance stuff) some lighter 'bob-your-head' numbers, the gentleness and hip simplicity still override this album and in effect these songs are so satisfying to listen to, as much as the stuff on \\"Quiet...\\".  Plus, like the earlier album, it's an effective stress-buster (duh!), though in my opinion this is a more accessible effort, especially if one has just discovered KoC through this cd. <br /> <br />If you already loved \\"Quiet...\\", then you may be a bit surprised by \\"Riot...\\"'s offering but shortly after you'll surely appreciate this follow-up.  And that means KoC are capable of reshuffling their music into different styles (if not completely evolving it), but (happily) I will mention this again--their individuality remains and will still remain.  Simply beautiful.   <br /> <br />
B00000AFFI|5.0|PJ Harvey is the kind of artist that likes to reinvent  (and I don't mean  `Madonna changes her eye liner' I mean REALLY reinvent herself) herself from album to album, `Dry' was  existential , `Rid Of Me' was an indebt look into the Male-Female roles and post feminism, `To Bring You My Love' almost obsessively deals with desire and sensuality and the later released `Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea' we see Harvey's more grounded side, but although all of those has their own uniqueness `Is This Desire?' is different, the sound is almost indefinable ,the songwriting raises to another level and in general it seeks match (but match)  deeper... <br /> <br />`Is This Desire?' is a collective of short stories that deals with the agony of bizarre tragic figures, that as both the out front and the allegoric sense are almost haunting by their images, Harvey's songwriting lays deep within you as she explores her characters and in a lot of way our own state in this world, while her message lays deep between her words. The album's sound explores new territories, and can be define as truly alternative (a term the most of as are use for Industrial and Indie Rock rather then truly original sound which the term was meant to define) it's match quieter (I heard the word `Mellow' being used at times to the album sound and I think it's far from being the case) but yet match more disturbing.  <br />I personally always Considered it as Harvey's strongest, wisest and deepest work. <br /> <br />The album starts with `Angelene' a tale of sinful soul of a prostitute seeking redemption, that could be her personal grief or the tell of a disturbed and sinful society  (`Love For Money Is My Sin'). The second and most positive track in the album `The Sky Lit Up' is about finding inspiration. `The Wind' describes the story of Catherine, a woman that wished power and recognition (`Catherine Likes high places, high up on the hills, a place for making noises like the whales, here she builta chapel with her image on the wall...') and now haunted for her vanity and greed (`but now she sits and moans'). In the Trip-Hop influenced `My Beautiful Leah' a women  (or a women within) self destructed herself (`She only had nightmares, and her sadness never lifted') for seeking the unseekable (\\"If I don't find it this time, then I better off dead\\"). `A Perfect Day' show us the story of Joe (Jesus?) where his emotional but empty  (`His face so pale and his hands so worm') desire for Elise destroys them both. `Catherine' defines bitterness, we find a person so eaten by jealousy that loses him\herself in the processes  (`'till the light shines on me, I damn to hell every second you breath'). `The Garden' tells an Eden like story, in which a man loses his angel wings. The story of `Joy' is about a girl who feared experience destructed in the awaking to the real world (`She looked away into a hollow sky ...She wanted to go blind, wanted hope to stay'). `The River' is a Nick Cave like piano ballad that tells a search for redemption. The final track of the album `Is This Desire' Joe (again Jesus?) fulfilled his wishes and the song ends in an existential question that in a lot of ways sums up the album  - is fulfilling and chasing our desires really makes us happy? - Is This Desire? <br /> <br />
B000002J03|5.0|This is the only Zep album I have so far (I'm planning to buy the Box Set eventually), and I've decided to review it right now! As you know, this is Led Zep's second CD - and it's NOT a sophmore slump at all! Every song on here (9) are CLASSICS! Every second of them ALL are. This is also the album that REALLY turned them into the classic rock legends that they are today, with huge hits like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", and \\"Ramble On\\". Their debut was a worldwide smash, but it didn't quite turn them into legends yet (that remains to be seen on here & LZ 4). LZII went on to sell over 12 Million Copies in the US! Now, onto the Track-by-Track review!<br /><br />1. Whole Lotta Love: Sure, its totally overplayed. That doesn't keep it from being one of Zep's greatest classics! Plant plays one of his first GREAT solos, and Plant absolutely SHREADS his voice and heart apart at the end. Daz right! (10/10)<br /><br />2. What Is And What Should Never Be: Another occasional radio staple, though not near as popular as WLL, this one is better IMO. I love Plant's voice on the chorus. (10/10)<br /><br />3. The Lemon Song: OMG.... VEEEEEEEERRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYY Underrated song. Might be my favorite on the album, it also might be their most bluesy influenced song. Why does no one appreciate this masterpiece? (100/10)<br /><br />4. Thank You: Another real underrated tune, though its not one of my favorites. You still gotta love it though! They will never top \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You or \\"Stairway to Heaven as their best acoustic song, however. (10/10)<br /><br />5. Heartbreaker: Arguably the most popular song on here besides WLL, Page's BEST solo of all time (yes, better than Stairway!) is featured near the end. Still a bit overrated, but absolutely my 2nd favorite song! (10/10)<br /><br />6. Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman): Another hit, Heartbreaker always leads into this song on the radio as well, since LLM is pretty short. I'm pretty sure it needs no more explanation. (10/10)<br /><br />7. Ramble On: Another staple, though not as well-known as a few others. Nice blend of folk and funk. Also about the middle age. Another one of the best! (10/10)<br /><br />8. Moby D*ck: OMG... OMG!!! Instrumental time, yay!! Now, I didn't forget Paul Jones & Bonham, did I? THIS is the best time to speak about em! Page plays another spectacular solo, while Bonahm... Oh, MAN... GOES ABSOLUTELY BANNAS AS 100000 MONKEYS COMBINDE WITH THE DRUM PEDALS!!!!!! Lol, sorry, just felt like goin' a little crazy there since that was absolutely GENIUS percussioning. RIP John Bonham :(. Paul Jones does some bassin' as well. (50/10)<br /><br />9. Bring It On Home: Another VASTLY underrated song. Starts and ends with an acoustic guitar and harmonica, then in the middle, its ROCK N ROLL TIME. Probably the 3rd or 4th best! (10/10)<br /><br />Overall: GREAT sophmore masterpiece, I want everybody to pick it up eventually (or, if you wanna spend all ya dough, get da Complete Studio Recordings Box Set). If you wanna buy albums indavidually, however, which is better if you get most of the albums used, I reccomend getting this or LZIV Untitled.<br /><br />Now, as in Will Culp's words:<br /><br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF ROCK, HEAVY METAL, BLUES, FOLK, AND LED ZEPPELIN! THIS AIN'T NO SOPHMORE SLUMP!!!!<br /><br />Also reccomended-<br /><br />Led Zeppelin- Led Zeppelin I<br /><br />Black Sabbath- Paranoid<br /><br />Aerosmith- Toys In The Attic<br /><br />I'm done here! Hope you enjoyed it! PLEASE don't be close-minded and have nothing better to do than lazily give a non-helpful, por favor?I'm pretty sure it needs no more explanation. (10/10) <br /> <br />7.

B000002UVX|3.0|It's a hsame that Jimi had to go out on such a mediocre album in my mind. Although I hae the South Saturn Delata and First Rays... albums, booth of which are interesting to hear, this is his last album. In certain parts it's good, but in other parts it's a little embarresing. Instead of a mere couple sentence review like other people do, I will now disect it song by song: <br /> <br />Who Knows- It just goes on too long. It starts off well, but Buddy Miles does that scatting type of music, which I never excepted. <br /> <br />Machine Gun- Definatley the highlight of the album. Check out other versions of this, like Isle of Wight. The solos are cool. Maybe it goes on a little too long, but I like it. <br /> <br />Changes- Oh my God. How many more times* will Buddy Miles play this song on an album? The version here is good. But I'm so sick of this song. <br /> <br />Power of Soul- I never liked this song. It's just to pop-like for me, and i find it too repetitive. <br /> <br />Message to Love aka. Message to the universe- I've heard way better version of this song. It seems out of tune here. Check out the studio version and the Woodstock version. <br /> <br />We Gotta Live Together- good song, but it again goes on a bit too long. It seems like a good closer to this album, but there has to be a lot more material from the New Years concert out there. Maybe a deluxe edition someday...
B00020HEL6|5.0|I'll make it short and sweet!!  Buy it.. you won't be sorry if you like music that reaches your heart and soul... Turn the lights low, pour your favoite beverage and relax...Renee will make you feel like falling in love all over again...
B00063MBU8|1.0|These guys suck. Just another punk, commercial band who whines about their lives. They try and put out a hard core \\"true punk\\" type image but when you hear their music it's so soft and alternative (not to metion annoying) that you would probably hear it at an elementay school dance. Where is punk going? They need to join Blink 182, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and Green Day all into a big group of punk bands who all sound alike and suck
B00007KWHG|5.0|Frankie Valli is the best and the Four Seasons are by far my all time favorite. I can not believe that someone would not know who they are or how great they are.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|hated it. thought this movie was alfull, glad i rented it instead of buying this turkey
B000294SFW|5.0|This album is awesome, classic Motorhead. Go buy it if you haven't already.
B0002OERI0|3.0|7 grammy nominations? I find that hard to believe but then again since Green Day is the main band you'd think of when you hear the word punk, I can kinda understand. I don't like this album but I give it 3 stars just because Green Day has been around so long.(I mean-Name a punk band they haven't influenced....?). These guys know how to rock out and aren't going anywhere anytime soon. I just don't like em.
B0007GAERG|3.0|I decided to give this album a three star rating because there are only three songs that struck me as being particularly fun or interesting. I enjoyed \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Get Your Number,\\" and \\"It's Like That\\" from the album. The rest of the songs fell short of what I'd hoped for (and believe me I REALLY wanted to like this CD).  <br />  <br />This album has been called \\"the return of the voice.\\" I don't know if I'd go that far! This is, at best, a mediocre effort from a woman with much more talent than her recent work would shows. I fear that Mariah may never recapture the magic of her 90s albums.  <br />
B0007GAERG|3.0|Ah well, I would actually give this CD 3.5 stars, almost to a 4. I read the good reviews and decided to run into a store to grab Mariah's new CD, turns out...I was a little disappointed. I would say it's very Beyonce-ish. The one thing I am happy about though is that Mariah has dropped the wispy background hissing this time round and decided to really articulate her vocals. Still, she reverts to her annoying wispy voice in Fly Like A Bird. There are some awesome lyrics in the songs (YAY - no more self-pitying!), but I would say some of the melodies sound extremely monotonous, and it's the beats that make them relatively lively. I'm the kind who goes for the melody rather than the beat, so songs like Your Girl prick my nerves.  <br /> <br />I think overall, the Emancipation of Mimi is okay, the voice is indeed back, but the songs are not my type. Too hip-hop + rap, plus the ballads -my all time favourite from Mariah - in this CD sound BORING and borrowed, like she recycled some similar tunes from songs in the Rainbow album. My true grip is with Fly Like A Bird is that Mariah uses her airy voice again, and while it fits certain songs, it completely spoiled this one. The most irritating part being her switching between her normal voice and the airy one. I can't help but to catch the inconsistency because it jumps out as jarring. She did the same for Through The Rain in Charmbracelet, only Through The Rain has a better melody.I would prefer Mariah to go back to R&B and ballads (the time when she sounds POWERFUL and carefree), minus the self-pitying lyrics and tendency for wispy singing and the overwhelming focus on background music.  <br /> <br />My favourites form this album have to be Circle and Shake It Off. One time I can say that Mariah's CD doesn't suck since Musicbox. Still, Mariah can do better. I miss her duets with great singers like All4One, BABYFACE and Trey Lorenz, Brian McKnight!!!!
B0002GN0OA|5.0|\\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm. There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was. All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand. The most important thing to know is that \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"). I feel about this film the way I did about \\"Memento,\\" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle). However, I think the audience that would enjoy \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to a quirkly little film like \\"Memento.\\"<br /><br />So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see \\"Am&eacute;lie.\\" Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider \\"spoilers,\\" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film's French title \\"Le Fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain\\" was reduced to just \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" for American consumption. Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film. One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).<br /><br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do. We then begin 48 hours in which d'Am&eacute;lie's life is changed. Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor. Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny. The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?<br /><br />The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world. Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy. But as long as Am&eacute;lie lives happily ever after we are content.<br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Amlie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do.

B000002KIE|5.0|Sometimes i just think, where would punk be if the Sex Pistols were still around? Maybe it wouldn't sound so bad. Since bands like the Sex Pistols, The Ramones, and The Clash were the basis of punk back in the day..They have influenced a lot of punk that is out today. In bad cases we ended up with bands like Blink 182 and Good Charlotte...but in good cases we ended up with bands like Alkaline Trio. Listening to the Sex Pistols reminds me that punk once was great. Today it has too many categories and too many bands mixing up into too many flavors that makes a nasty kool-aid. If the Sex Pistols were still around they would be showing everyone that pure punk is still pure punk.
B000002UDB|5.0|Strawberry Fields Forever, I am The Walrus, Penny Lane, and ALl You Need is Love are all songs that live on as rock standards and they are amazing songs that make this album great. Not to Mention that every other song on this album is also great. Magical Mystery Tour is an amazing acheivment from the greatest band of all time and although it is not their best it almost matches the lp released a few months before, Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts CLub Band, which is considered the Beatles most prominent album. This is also The Beatles most psychedelic album which shows on I am The Walrus, Flying, and Strawberry Fields. Buy this cd if you are already a slight beatles fan and even if your starting to get into the beatles. If u do not like this album then dont judge The Beatltes music by your impression here. Abbey Road, The WHite Album, Revolver, Sgt Peppers, Help, Rubber SOul, Let it BE are all magnificent as well.
B000002C25|5.0|\\"...But I just think theres some good sounds on it and it was just a bit scatty and a bit mentally produced but thats who we are man, but I'd say that one (favourite album), so go f#%ken buy cause theres loads left\\" Liam Gallaghar July 2000. <br /> <br />And it is a great album, Definitley Maybe and Whats the story had the \\"wonderwalls\\" and \\"Supersonics\\" but nothing like this swirl and giant noise of guitar rock. <br /> <br />Its a mega mega album and a triumphant album, and definitley not a dissapointment.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I have 4 years of psychology knowledge and experience, so to say this movie is easy to understand. No!! It was bizarre and didn't make any sense and by the end of the movie, you pretty much feel WHO CARES. There were many boring parts also. Well, the movie was boring overall and very is confusing, lacking a plot and lacking sense. All I know is it had something to do with repressed memories, and it was like a puzzle with hundreds of missing pieces. Movies are suppose to enteratin, not to sit all night trying to figure out what's going on in the movie causing an unpleasant thought provoking process. It was way too complicated to the point when you don't enjoy it! I remember exams being funner and easier than understanding this movie. There is no point.
B00005JNRB|5.0|We just came home from the theatre where me an my son who is 11 saw this film. It was extremely entertaining without excess violence and no bad language. I plan to purchase this one when it comes out on DVD. Since Hildago, it is the best action movie we have seen in recent memory. The best part is that is is both fast action and hilarious. Go see it.
0451169514|5.0|This is the most frightening book I've ever read. Stephen King is the best horror writer ever.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Let me try to review this album without addressing everyones opinion.  The one thing I do want to say is that in regards to returning to a 90's style of music which is what many would like MC to do. would be like \\"you\\" opening up your photo album and trying to recreate the clothing or hairstyle you wore almost 15 years ago.  I think the point is clear.  Moving on.  Emanicipation of Mimi is one fierce album.  Its a shame but critcs amateur and professional can do alot to hurt a good career.  In my opinion thats been the problem not Mariah's singing or music.  I must admit when MC started experimenting with the \\"whispers\\" I too was thrown off a bit, but I stayed with her and my listening ear heard a woman experimenting with her voice and at the very least probably trying to satisfy the critics who say she screamed too much.  At any rate, who the heck cares.  This album is top notch.  The vocals are fantastic and the music is hip yet not over the top.  Mariah has never lost that beautiful voice.  If people had listened to Glitter they would have realized.  That album had some of her best and I mean best singing.  On emancipation she outdoes herself on \\"Stay the night\\" which is my favorite because of the soul of Kanye's production and the soul in how she sings the song especially toward the end of the song.  There isn't a bad song on this cd.  Its perfectly balanced with collabos a few but not too many.  After 15 years though I would say that the only competition MC has is against herself.  She's in the category that Michael Jackson found himself.  Trying to outdo himself and although i doubt that MC is consciously trying to do this, the critics seem to create the situation.  We all have out favorite time periods of MC but she's doing her own thing and its working.  10 years ago you didn't find pop and hip hop fusing and MC almost single handedly put her career on the line for what she believed it.  GO MC, i'd say you are emancipated.
B00000F0D1|5.0|Who could ever forget Misery, and the infamous hobbling scene that is almost unbearable to watch because it actually shows her break his ankles, and the special effects were impressive when his foot went in the other direction making it look real. The title is kind of ironic because it really is after the main character of paul sheldon's romance novels Misery Chastain, but if you think about it, being where he was, held captive by a psychotic obsessive nurse. Misery is the word, (miserable) Anyway Kathy Bates is brilliant, and my favorite parts are when she goes from nice nurse can i getcha anything to overreacting completely opposite psycho nurse, like a split personality scaring the sh*t out of paul sheldon. And the fact that he had to patronize her to keep her happy, and humor her outbursts was even more intense because you never knew what she would do next. Think of it, a famous writer crashes his car in a snow-storm, and is suddenly rescused by a seemingly nice woman who claims to be his number 1 fan. What a coincidence. At first he doesn't know what is in store for him, and he starts to catch on to her odd temper and bizarre comments about his books. It's a creepy thriller and the fact that the place was in the middle of nowhere, and he cant walk or get to a phone, and she keeps lying to him that the roads arent cleared yet. The story was brilliantly written and it's the kind of scenario that is like a worste nightmare. Rob Reiner directed it perfectly, and an especially nice touch was when annie flipped out over the paper preference and the classical music kept getting faster and faster when she got more and more angry while yelling WHAT'S THE MATTER? I GO OUTTA MY WAY FOR YOU! I DO EVERYTHING TO TRY AND MAKE YOU HAPPY. AND WHAT THANKS DO I GET. YOU BOUGHT THE WRONG PAPER ANNIE, I CANT TYPE ON THIS ANNIE. WELL I'LL GET YOU YOUR STUPID PAPER BUT YOU BETTER SHOW ME A LITTLE MORE APPRECIATION HERE MR MAN!!!!!!! Obviously indicating that she overreacts and is a raving lunatic. And she keeps getting worse and worse, like slamming chairs against the walls, slamming the paper stacks on his legs, bringing out guns, and tying him to the bed, giving him shots, and then breaking his ankles so he couldnt escape. It's sick stuff but it's great!
B00009NOF4|4.0|I bought Hail to the Theif in pure excitement, ready for another adventure into Thom Yorke's twisted mind. I even bought it overpriced, because I wanted it right away. I popped it in the CD player. After awile, I was disappointed.<br />I put it off for awile, and listened to it every so often. It started to grow on me. It was really much different from other Radiohead albums.<br />Overall, it is a good album, but as the review says, it takes a few listens to get the most out of it. But because of inital disappointment, it only recieves 4 stars from me.<br />I do not think it deserves the awards that Amazon.com has given it, however. If you are a fan and can find it cheap, go for it.<br />A good album, but Radiohead could've done better. Their aim was to take elements from their previous albums and mix them into this one. Not too swell of a plan for new listeners.<br />Corey.
B0007GAERG|5.0|THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is a modern r&b masterwork.  Ms. Carey croons, wails and shrieks with such soulfulness and control, while the neo-soul flavored musical arrangements recall mid 70s Marvin Gaye and early 80's Atlantic Star.  The rappers this time compliment Mariah instead of overpowering her, while the hip hop beats perfectly fit the uptempo songs like a glove.  Tasty songs such as \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Circles\\" and \\"Your Girl\\" would have been perfect on a Rufus and Chaka Khan album from the mid 70s, while club bangers \\"To The Floor\\", \\"Say Something\\" and \\"It's Like That\\" get the body moving in a classy manner.  The best thing about this album is that Mariah Carey is finally learning when to wail and when to hold back.  And when she hits a glass shattering note, it sounds organic instead of showoffy.  As for the rest of the r&b albums this year?  They have a tough act to follow.
B00069YDXU|4.0|Ah, the people who give this one or two stars...must be  watching on a black and white TV with a 1.5 inch speaker!     This is an aged ELP no doubt, but put this up against the Royal Albert Hall DVD and this one wins hands down for me!     The guys make mistakes yes, but I think it's better to see the real deal than some cleverly edited and overdubbed B.S., if you know what I mean. The doubletake Carl shoots to Greg when he screws up a line in Tarkus is worth the price of admission!    But the best thing about this DVD that you won't and don't get from Albert Hall is the close ups of Keiths hands.  Excellent!The camera work in general is not great, but these close ups are astounding! This is the show folks....watching Keith Emerson's fingers fly across the keys, this is what we've been waiting for! The same goes for Carl and Greg.    I don't know what happened to the sound on Albert Hall, but I thought it was screwed up, so I returned the DVD and got another one, with the same results....stange imaging with the stereo and surround image collapsing, bass moving around..strange stuff in places where it definetly shouldn't be. Very unerving. Greg's voice sounds thin and rough like the life is mixed right out of it.    But the sound quality here on Montreux is far superior, very clean with excellent imagining. Greg's voice is not the pristine choirboy of his youth, but better than Albert Hall. I've got a studio quality system at home and the sound on this DVD is really very good. Nice warm Hammond and synths, bass and drums, all around superior to Albert Hall.     Buy this DVD..it's not ELP in the 70's at the hieght of their powers, but with the great close ups and the decent sound quality, you can't go wrong!
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD is just awesome! Every single song is complete. I promise you I`ve never heard a better album in my whole life. Kurt Cobains voice is so powerful and emotional that it almost hurts listening to it, and the other guys, Dave and Krist are very gifted too. Dave is crazy on the drums, and Krist...Yes that guy know how to play bass. Kurt are also a great guitarplayer and songwriter. The songs are rough, but they`ve all got melody. Buy this one! You won`t regret it!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I started this review 3 times, and erased it every time. It's hard to explain something like Amnesiac without people actually hearing the album all the way through. (If you can, sometimes it's difficult.)<br />Most people hate this album and think it's garbage. Sure, it WAS on the cutting room floor of Radiohead's studio, but thats the beauty of it. They cut out most of the angrier songs of Kid A.<br />Think of this album as you looking down on something or someone with pure disgust. Making you want to spit on that person or object. Wait, don't. Listen for yourself and create your own image of what the album means.<br />I have this feeling that this album will someday have the same social identity as The Catcher in the Rye. Someone's going to kill someone else and their going to say that Radiohead's Amnesiac inspired them.<br />As the band says, &quot;Kid A is like watching a fire from afar, Amnesiac is like being in that fire yourself.&quot; Or something to that effect.<br />5 stars.<br />Corey.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|It is nice and refreshing to listen to an artist in his 20s that can actually sing. I don't even listen to this type of music much but some of the tracks on this album are very addictive. This is definitely not elevator music. It is slickly produced jazz - that is meant to be listened to with dim lights while sipping cocktails. The highlights of the album are \\"Quando Quando\\", \\"Home\\" and \\"Song for you\\". This CD is most definitely worth listening to.
B00006JJ51|5.0|LMFAO, my momma, unlike mike's, is normal. <br /> <br />N.W.A, phatt CD. WHo else had the balls to make tha track F**K Tha Police?!?! Nuff Said, yeheard. <br /> <br />One love, i'm out. <br /> <br />GOD <br /> <br />P.S: Mike, i know why u have no friends. And also, no one wants to know bout what underwear you wear!! FREAK. (everyone read all his reviews, collector448 is his no.)
B0007GAERG|5.0|Right off the bat, I've noticed that many of those who gave this album bad reviews have sais that it is for the Jessica/Britney/Christina generation. Not true at ALL. I can't stand all three of those bitches, and I still love Mariah. With that said, on to reviewing this album... <br /> <br />Mariah, what took you so long to come out with this? This could have saved your career after the Glitter incident. It's obvious that Miss Carey has learned to tone herself down quite a bit because the ONLY song where she goes into glass shattering mode is on the final track, but with it being a gospel track, it's somewhat appropriate. And to the reviewer who said that she is trying to turn \\"black\\", guess what? She IS black, or did you not know that?
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I saw this film in theaters out of curiosity factor. I didn't know if I could sit through a 90+ minute film of puppets, but this surprised me with its humor and catchy songs. Trey Parker and Matt Stone really outdid themselves with this one. They achieved a near brilliant film...with only a few minor objectionable and possibly offensive scenes. <br /> <br />Perhaps the biggest controversial scene that required to be cut was the sex scene. Even though it is laughably funny the MPAA demanded cuts to this scene or risk an NC-17 rating, I do understand their decision. If parents brought their children thinking this was a \\"kid's movie\\"...the sex scene would have raised some uncomfortable questions from their children. Its a raunchy and funny scene that adults will get a kick out of. There is another scene that I wasn't sure if it was a parody of how Americans reacted to the Monica Lewinsky scandal (especially since we now know that Clinton was trying to go after Osama but Republicans in Congress claimed he was merely using Osama to distract Americans from \\"the real problem\\"--i.e. sex). The scene is funny, but it wasn't clear what the point was...other than to be as offensive as they could be. <br /> <br />For me, the reason I detract a star is because I thought the vomiting scene went on too long and it was disgustingly tacky. I thought that scene would never end, as just when you think the puppet couldn't vomit any more, out comes another spew. Judging the laugher I heard in the theater, I guess for some people, the puppet could vomit for 30 minutes and still be funny, but I stopped laughing after the second time. <br /> <br />I love the skewering this film does at the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer films (with a song about why the film \\"Pearl Harbor\\" sucked--which was so true), our nationalistic and macho aggression (with the song \\"America, F*** Yeah!\\"), the musical \\"Rent\\", evil dictators (I'm sure this film is banned in North Korea, with the Elmer Fuddish Kim Jong Il lisping \\"I'm so Ronery\\"), and most of all, pretentious Hollywood actors and their causes (watch out Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Alex Baldwin). Everyone gets a deserved kick in the pants...conservatives and liberals. Who would be offended more by this film? I would put money on conservatives, since this film flaunts raunchiness in their faces (with the sex scenes and profanities). This film is a great satire about America as it was in 2004. I left the theaters still laughing with one song stuck in my head (the hard charging and macho \\"America, F*** Yeah!\\"). If you enjoy satire and don't get easily offended, buy this dvd and get the soundtrack as well. You'll be surprised how a movie about puppets can entertain and still make a point. The biggest point being...aren't we all puppets playing by someone else's hands (manipulation)? We need to cut the strings of our attachments and avoid both extremes...for they both have agendas more sinister than we realize. I'm glad someone had the courage to make this film.
0393035158|5.0|We live in an era when our lives and our beloved democracy are threatened from Fundamentalism-- both Fundamentalism from abroad and Fundamentalism within America itself. Harris rejects  ethnicity, class, and economics (draped in religious discourse) as causal variables for our current miseries. All religions create suffering, says Harris, even the most liberal. He asks us to reject irrationality, ignorance, intolerance and the ancient myths, to search for new ways of living ethically and creating community based on reason, honesty and love. I loved his book, highlighted it and shared it. I will order more copies for friends. We are sliding backwards fast, our options are closing. To survive, we need the support of Sam Harris and others like him. Thanks, Sam. Suzanne Lowrie, La Jolla, California
0810945797|5.0|Anyone who's seen this movie will be familiar with the breathtaking level of detail and effort that went into the production design. One could watch the film a hundred times over and still pick up on small things and be totally puzzled over the meaning of it all. When you think about it, The Dark Crystal is a small miracle. Not only is it a very grim kids film, hardly any of the mythology is explained and there's loads of subtext and hidden meanings. How many can say that about Finding Nemo?<br /><br />Brian Froud has always been fascinated with faeries and goblins and such so when he was hired by Jim Henson to work on this movie it must have been a dream come true. The first section of this book covers Froud's experiences working on the movie. It's an interesting read but the remaining part of the book requires the reader to have a vivid recollection of events in the film and patience to add it all up. Not an easy read or your typical 'making of' book at all.<br /><br />Two thirds of the book is told from the point of view of Aughra, the one and only of her race, the prophet born of rock and stone. She explains to us the history of her world, the great divide of the Urskeks and the creation of uUru and Skeksis.<br /><br />The depth of Brian Froud's imagination is astonishing. The triangular and circular imagery of the film is spelled out so vividly that several reads of each page are needed in order to fully understand it all. The quality of the presentation is of the highest standard. The book is a huge hardback with beautiful pictures in color, black and white and daguerreotype. Some pages are translucent trace paper laid over spirals to give us a better idea of what they mean. A reproduction of Jim Henson's original presentation to potential backers of the film is included in the back page inserted in a pouch.<br /><br />Investment in this book is well worth the money for fans of the film and those interested in faery mythology and even art students.
0783226837|4.0|In the tradition of THEM!, THE DEADLY MANTIS, THE BLACK SCORPION, and other monster bug movies, TREMORS gives us an entertaining 95 minutes worth of nonsense. Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) are handymen in the tiny desert town of Perfection Nevada, where they do all the jobs that no one else wants to do. One day, they finally decide they've had enough and load up the truck for anywhere-but-here-ville. This would be great, except for the gargantuan worm-monsters that have just eaten some roadworkers and destroyed the only exit from Perfection. Val and Earl must stay and help their neighbors to defeat these burrowing beasts. TREMORS is a lot of fun to watch! I especially enjoyed Heather and Burt Gummer (Reba McEntire and Michael Gross) as the couple with the doomsday arsenal in their basement! They are two of the most memorable characters in all of monsterdom! Their elephant gun, tech-9s, and make-shift pipebombs are a wonder to behold! Played fairly straight, these two come across as more human than cartoon, and are actually helpful against the monsters instead of just comic relief. The monster wormys themselves are very well done. Today, they would be CGI critters, but for 1989 they ain't bad at all! Finn Carter is also good as the grad student who first notices the seismic disturbances underground. Add TREMORS to your next monster mixer...
0743454537|1.0|I joined a book club this past year (2004), and it's been intresting to read books I normally would not choose to read on my own.  Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is decidely a book I would not have read otherwise.  I do not have a anything against fiction by women.  Some of my favoourite authors include Susan Isaacs, Elinor Lipman, and Margaret Atwood, to name only a few.  The concept is interesting.. is it right to concieve a child to save the life of another child?The characters are not precisely one dimensional, but are not fully rounded.  I would not be willing to have dinner with most of them.What irritates me the most of this could have been great book is the ending.  Instead of making some tough choices, Picoult engages in a very \\"deus ex machina\\" event, where choice is eliminated.  It is almost as if she had written herself into a corner, and was too impatient to think and then write herself out of this corner.I am not sure if I will read any other books by Jodi Picoult.

0393035158|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" is an excellent book that presents a solid and fascinating argument for its title.  It also gives an atheist  intellectual ammunition to treat religion with the lack of respect it deserves. <br /> <br />The interview with Harris on this website is also worthwhile.  However, while I'm no expert on mysticism, I disagree with Harris that the feeling of \\"I\\" is a \\"cognitive illusion.\\"  Cognitive, yes.  Illusion, no.  People are individual entities in reality, and their consciousness reflects that fact. <br /> <br />For a fascinating analysis of consciousness (and everything else), try Leonard Peikoff's \\"Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand.\\" <br /> <br />For a mind-blowing theory about consciousness, try Julian Jaynes' \\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.\\"  (A lot more reader-friendly than it sounds.) <br /> <br />For insight into the sociology of power, which impacts our future whether you have faith of not, try Andrew Bard Schmookler's \\"The Parable of the Tribes.\\" <br /> <br />Reason rules.  Ultimately, that is.
B0007GAERG|5.0|okay...everybody has an opinion..and not everyone will agree with what another person has said...but!!!!all i can say is Mariah did her thing this time...i have been listening to Faith Evans new cd for a minute and then i broke down and bought Mariah's on friday the 15th....i was very skeptical about even buying the cd because everybody been saying lately they dont like Mariah anymore....Well...i had kinda let those opinions keep me from making the purchase... <br />anyway....i made the choice to buy it from wallyworld \\"wal-mart\\" <br />cause of course they have it cheaper than anybody, and, I figured i'd rather spend 9.74 at Wal-mart instead of 9.99 at best buy..ha ha <br /> <br />few minutes later I was playing the music and feeling every song she had put out...... <br />MY GOD...Mariah...what took you so long... <br />I have not stopped playing the cd.... <br />I had been telling everybody that Faith had done it up this time...but, now..she is on the back burner and i am abusing the cd Mariah put out... <br />This is only my opinion and ere'body know opinions are like <br />@$$holes....but hey....if @$$holes are this good...i'm gonna be a bootyfan for life

0143034901|4.0|This is the kind of book that needs to be read as quickly as possible so that you don't forget what happened in the beginning by the time you get to the end. The cast of characters is enormous and the author describes each of their lives in far more detail than is strictly necessary. The complex lives of all these characters makes for a very complex plot, which at times can become quite confusing. The author takes a long time to weave his complicated tale, so the book starts off slowly. But stick with it. It starts to pull you in about a quarter of the way through. Ultimately, the book is about Daniel's (the narrator) quest to learn more about the obscure and seemingly forgotten author Julian Carax. This quest eventually introduces many subplots both in the present and the past. Eventually, all the threads of these little stories come together in the end and it all makes sense. Despite the slow beginning, by the end it's hard to stop reading.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I just got the CD (from CDNOW Buyer's Club) and after a few spins, I am here to confirm that the CD sounds great. Windowpane is definitely a highlight, and so is In My Time Of Need. Opeth offers both an innovative sound as well as great music to fall asleep to. I'm not saying this album is totally quiet (I almost found myself falling asleep during Death Whispered A Lullaby but the chorus woke me up) All in all, do yourself a favor and pick this album up from CDNOW.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Ozu meets Edward Hopper in the modern American Southwest. Lots of luscious greens and reds in cinematographer Robby Mueller's palette. Long-overdue starring role for great character actor Harry Dean Stanton. Beautiful score by blues guitarist Ry Cooder. Great transfer in widescreen format, with excellent commentary by director Wenders. The disc is a bargain at twice the price, so grab it up now.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Avril may not be the most wonderful person, but she's definatly got some raw musical talent. In \\"Under My Skin\\", Avril explores a more tough and tender side of her...which of course ends up being just as spunky as she is. <br /> <br />The track \\"Together\\" has a very pretty melody and some great lyrics to accompany it. It's driving and painful, which draws the listener in. \\"Fall To Pieces\\" is a good example of subtle tone quality which gives Avril her trademark cynical vibe she displayed in \\"Let Go\\". It's a straightforward song but it reaches deep down.  <br /> <br />The only problem with this album is that it's just a little too dark. None of the songs truly relift the listener up from the dark, so it all feels very same-sounding. Most of the songs in one way or another are about relationships and how they all suck.  <br /> <br />So all in all, it's a nice CD for when you're depressed or if you like punky pop-rock....but it could have been better.
B0007OASII|5.0|Kamelot's 2003 release Epica was a powerful concept piece inspired by Goethe's Faust. It dealt with the battles between good and evil, and made a great addition to the band's catalog. The Black Halo is their seventh studio release; and from a lyrical standpoint, it is a logical continuation of Faust, but at the same time, it combines the themes of the story with the band's own experiences and political views, some of which touch extensively on the war in Iraq among other cultural and religious events.<br /><br />As this album also takes its inspiration from Faust, there are some references to Epica, musically speaking. Every once in a while, a melody line will make its way into the mix, taking you back to the band's previous album, but it's all just for a brief moment. The Black Halo, as its cover art and Mattias Noren's beautiful work on the booklet pages suggest, is quite possibly the darkest and toughest album Kamelot have ever done. Although the classic Kamelot sound is still present, The Black Halo differs from the band's previous releases in some significant ways. \\"March of Mephisto\\" puts the band Kamelot, Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir and Jens Johansson (Stratovarius) in the same context, embodying the dark nature of the album, characterized by sinister atmospheres and emphasis on a dynamic guitar sound. Johansson plays a soul-torturing keyboard solo that is the diametric opposite of what we've come to expect from him. Shagrath also brings depth to the music, singing semi-growled lyrics to provide a striking contrast to Roy Khan's low vocals. I was utterly amazed when I heard this track that I was anxious to hear the rest of the song for fear that they might have gone back to their more forthright power metal style. Thank god I was quite pleased to discover that they'd chosen to retain the dark elements in their music for the whole album, therefore surprising me and many other fans.<br /><br />Roy Khan's singing on this disc recalls his work with Conception; he mostly sings in a low-key, rarely attempting at impressing the listener with his already world-famous high screams. His low vocals allow him to impress us with his incredibly wide range. He is supported by various singers through the album; Simone Simons from Epica does an angelic vocal performance on \\"The Haunting\\" which is a mid-tempo track that offers layers of depth and beauty. Agile keyboard melodies are replaced by a charging guitar solo from Thomas Youngblood, whose restrained yet incredibly articulate playing is one of the main motives of this disc. Youngblood never overplays; he just gives the songs what they need, be it speed, melody or power. Together with Glenn Barry's bass, Youngblood serves us the classic Kamelot power metal anthems in the forms of \\"When the Lights are Down\\", \\"Soul Society\\", \\"Nothing Ever Dies\\" or the title track. Thanks to Sascha Paeth's brilliant production job, Youngblood's guitar sound has more crunch than ever, and Barry's bass is subtle on the whole disc, which isn't something too common in today's power metal albums. All the songs are interwoven with majestic speed, gripping melodies and crushing power riffs as well as blasting double drums courtesy of Casey Grillo.<br /><br />After every four song (tracks #5, #9 and #13), there is a brief interlude section for about a minute. These interludes all help the storyline of the concept come across; they're very short, either it's someone lighting a match, walking on snow, or simply uttering indecipherable spoken sections. Track nine, however, is different, as it features Cinzio Rizza singing in Italian for about 40 seconds, but it's so amazing, you just have to hear it. All these interludes are anchored into one piece, given they serve the purpose of making the concept more clear. The songs are all multi-layered; Kamelot have put as much thought in the background as in the forground. On \\"Nothing Ever Dies\\", it's a hidden keyboard line played under Barry's bass; on \\"This Pain\\", it's a nifty acoustic guitar laid down beneath Khan's vocals. The level of artistry that went into this album is simply astonishing.<br /><br />\\"Memento Mori\\" is the 9-minute epic of the album as well as the longest song in Kamelot's career. The band explores many different movements in this track, ranging from grand orchestral sounds, female choirs, beautiful piano and string passages, and shuddering guitar and keyboards solos. Shagrath returns to the fold with his sinister singing, before the Kamelot orchestra takes the lead and plays a stunning folk-laden piece that is right up there with Pain of Salvation's brilliant work on Be. I also seem to hear a secret folk-flavoured theme in the background of the song \\"Moonlight\\" where Khan perhaps does his most Conception-like vocals amidst huge orchestral arrangement and solid guitar riffs floating around.<br /><br />\\"Abandoned\\", needless to say, is the album's soaring power ballad, graced by lush strings, pianos and female vocalists. Khan's canonical singing on this song is smooth, emotive and nothing short of heart-wrenching. The Black Halo is one of the best power metal albums and already a top 10 disc for 2005.id down beneath Khan's vocals.

1565123875|4.0|Purple Hibiscus is a strong coming-of-age novel set in Nigeria and narrated by fifteen-year-old Kambili, a young girl beset by family turmoil/violence inside the home and political turmoil/violence outside.   <br />   Kambili's father is a \\"big man\\"-owner of factories,  publisher of a staunchly independent newspaper, philanthropist, and a pillar of the local Catholic faith, financial and otherwise.  Inside the home, however, he is a rigidly religious tyrant who uses violence to keep his family in line, regularly beating Kambili, her mother, and her older brother.  This cycle of internal violence, outward philanthropy is disrupted by two events--the political coup that causes all sort of social/economic disruption and creates an effective background of constant menace and tension, and a trip by Kambili and her brother to a widowed aunt's home, where she sees what a \\"regular\\" family looks like.  As the book progresses, tension and violence increase on each front.  Kambili's father's newspaper becomes a target of political intimidation and serious violence as it stands up against the new government. Meanwhile, Kambili's father himself turns more and more violent as his sister's influence begins to cause cracks of disobedience to appear in his family. <br />  The voicing by Kambili is wonderfully done, made up of quiet observations detailing her fears and doubts.  Is this how people talk, she wonders?  How do they find the courage?  The words?  But her words carry the novel through the scenes of  domestic violence, of political turmoil, of a young girl's first crush (on a young priest she meets while at her aunt's), of a young boy's first few steps into defiance and adulthood (her brother Jaja), of a clash of cultures and religions, of death.  <br />  While Kambili and her narration are the strong part of the novel, the other characters more than carry their weight.  Each of them, with the possible exception of the mother, is sharply drawn and full of life.  Her aunt, her cousin, the priest, her grandfather-all of them are full characters as opposed to simple role players meant to move plot along.  This especially includes her father, who could have been simply (and simplistically) portrayed as a monster.  He is, but he is also much more.  He shows true courage in his willingness to take on the government.  He shows true compassion in his willingness to spend his money on those less fortunate.  He is a man of faith.  And yet.  He is ruthless in his authoritarianism with regard to his family, refusing to see his father or to let his grandchildren spend more than fifteen minutes a few times a year with him.  And his violence is truly shocking.  Parts of this book are difficult to read, though the author never lingers for long, never exploits the violence for cheap emotional effect.  What makes it even more chilling is how coolly rational the father is when he turns violent. These are not sudden emotional outbursts of an ignorant man but the rationalized discipline of an intelligent man who truly thinks he is doing what he must for the sake of his family (which of course can be read in a broader, more allegorical sense). <br />  The book marches toward its end and if it is often dark, the darkness is leavened by some  humor, some warmth, and the small steps Kambili and her brother take toward maturation and toward breaking the chains of their home.  The end, as one would expect, is not a simple, \\"they all lived happily ever after\\" ending.  But it is also not totally dark, or even mostly dark.  It is, however, realistic. <br />    Finally, while the book focuses on the internal more than the external, Hibiscus has a wonderfully vivid sense of place, conveyed not in long sweeping passages of description but in the small tiny details of day to day life and interaction--the food being cut, the scents in the air, the logistical obstacles involved in taking a drive, etc.  Nigeria is communicated rather than described. <br />  An excellent debut novel, strongly recommended. <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This music is excellent!  I had seen some of the PBS special, so I had to buy the CD.  These young women are extremely talented, and the songs they performed are beautiful.  Some, like Orinoco Flow, are fun, too.  It's an excellent CD, and I hope they do another one.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have found so often in the fantasy genre very few well done films. <br />Most are second grade B movies. I recommend Willow to any fantasy film <br />buff. Highly entertaining, great effects and acting even by the baby. <br />Val Kilmer is suited for so many roles and his role as Madmartigan in <br />this film is no exception. Jean Marsh's role as Queen Bavmorda is <br />similar in ways that remind me somewhat of the evil queen in the Snow <br />White story (only meaner). And of course we must not forget the role of <br />the dwarf Willow Ufgood (the hero of the story) played by midget <br />Warwick Davis. This film held my attention through out it gets an all <br />around 5 from me.
B00078XKDE|5.0|Their debut album was already a hint for things to come. And initially, as i heard \\"No Wow\\" i had second thoughts as i was still under the influence of their first LP. I thought they went and fixed something that wasnt broken. But these second thoughts evaporated in a hurry after only a couple of hearings. <br /> <br />   It's clear (at least to me by now) that the Kills have an irresistible formula in their hands and it seems they can go on pulling this off forever. <br /> <br />   While their sound is yes a minimalist affair, it's richer yet than most bands out there. This is probably due to a very charismatic singer who can effortlessly come close to sound like one of the great modern female vocalists: P.J Harvey. I tend to think in fact, that, to bury her dirty-blues voice under anything more complex musically would be a crime. Her voice functions perfectly like an instrument for itself and it sets the cue for the dark moody and angry songs it delivers. <br /> <br />    Sure, since the comparisons are there, the Kills lyrics might not be as intricate as Harvey's are, but then that would be my only critique on them. Because, other than that, this is one seriously addictive album. All based on one formula like their first one, but all of it hitting the spot regardless and repeatedly. <br /> <br />   Some of the rather negative reviews i read here are clearly missing the score. Someone mentioned drum machines in a negative fashion. That perplexes me.  <br />   \\"No Wow\\" qualifies easily as one of the outstanding releases in the rock genre this year  if only for its intimidating atmosphere and its creativity in combining rhythm and vocals. With better promotion this band would be going through a lot of people's ears who are actually being content with far less than what the Kills have to offer. <br /> <br />

B0002EXH4A|5.0|This album rocks my Ass. The remastered version is a HUGE improvement over the original quality wise. The vocals are as badass as anything I've ever heard. People who complain about the lyrics on this cd dont know anything I can tell you that. The robot voice on \\"set the world afire\\" has been toned down considerably if not eliminated but it still sounds cool cause Dave Mustain's voice sounds robotic enough anyway. Overall the instruments come out sounding more crisp than on the original you hear more of each individual instrument which is how it should be. The cymbals and drums are noticeably clearer. Dont get me wrong this isnt the black album in terms of production quality even with the remaster but it makes a great cd sound a hell of a lot better. BUY IT NOW FOOLS!!

The production sounds way better than most previous megadeth releases and now its remastered so it sounds even better. People who say the remastered megadeth cds sound worse are DEAD WRONG believe me I know they sound better and are worth the money even if u got all the old non-remastered ones. The best song is \\"This was my life\\" it literally rocks my world as does the rest of the cd. BUY IT NOW, YOU SHALL NOT REGRET!!!!!!

B0006SNK9E|5.0|The SWEET shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to Rock. From the first 30 seconds of track one \\"Set Me Free\\" for good or bad, you know those days are gone for ever. In the process they acquire an entirely new audience. The SWEET have attained their adolescence. Although they do not have total control (yet) of the final product, they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest. This gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product. As adolescents, gone is the \\"goodie two-shoes\\" image. The topics now range from fast cars (Rebel Rouser) to bi-sexual women (AC-DC). In the 70's the \\"moral majority\\" still ruled over freedom of expression, so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour. <br /> <br />Oh yes the music...I could decipher the music for pages but I'll let YOU do it. Someone once wrote that SWEET was a fly by night, 3 chord churning and \\"very limited talent wise\\" band. Alright then \\"smarty pants\\", compare Pat Benatar's cover of the song \\"No You Don't\\" to the original SWEET version. Compare the drums, guitar and vocals. Then you can make-up your own mind...  <br /> <br />GREAT STUFF!!! An excellent deal with all those extra tracks. <br />
B00000IN5G|5.0|These guys rock the guitar playing by their lead guitarist Alexi is awesome the riffs and the solos wow, these guys are great my favourite song would have to be Hatebreeder though all their songs are awesome truly one HELL of a band if you are into metal then i suggest you go pick this album up cos its fantastic.It would be money well spent.
B00005JNZJ|5.0|Aeon Flux is the very beautiful creation from the mind of Peter Chung.  The original (sans dialog) was far better and pure art.  This is a wonderful rendition of the original, but for the puritan Aeon flock it falls short after the first words are spoken.  Aeon is a little more cleaned up and less the lovely dominatrix she was in the original. Still, not exactly a family show, it is wonderful animation entertainment - Mr. Chung is a master and deserves far more credit than what this toned down MTV series offers as his true expression.  Nonetheless, this is an outstanding addition to any discriminating animation viewers' library.  Oh, yes, for all the REAL Ms.Flux fans out there, bring the ice cubes as you will need them... enjoy.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This cd will appeal to lovers of rock, aleternative, punk, disco... whatever. If you listen to it in the shower or in your car, you can't help but just go crazy inside. It has a feel to it that can't be explained in words. When an album is this good, you really just have to give it the respect it deserves. This one deserves it.
B0007P3582|3.0|50ent isn't all he claims to be we all know he has a sick production team on the best lables(aftermath,shady,gunit)and tons of \\"street credit\\" put he is just an average lyricist. I have to say some of the songs are really good. like \\"In my hood\\" wich is agreat start to the album.others\\"dico inferno\\",baltimore love thang\\" (were 50 rymes as if he is herion),\\"ski mask way\\" \\"go gave me style\\" and the awsome remix of \\"leave it or love it\\"' which is featuring gunit (young buck has the best verse in that song)and a few other great songs but there is also alot of disapointments.Like \\"Candy shop\\" and a few others its certantly no \\"Get rich or die tryin\\" but its worth the money.     P.s piggy bank isn't that bad of a diss dong just stop hatin people
1400032717|5.0|I loved this book because it allowed you to peer into the mind of an autistic boy - an amazing perspective.  It is funny, touching, insightful and poignant all in one.  I look forward to reading more of Haddon's work.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is as heavy as it gets. I absolutely LOVE this album. It's timeless. It will be just as hardcore 20 years from now as it was the day it dropped. And its one of the few albums that I NEVER tire of listening to. I can put the cd on repeat and listen to it over and over again. Another album like that is Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" This album is ripe with rage , angst and sadness. When I was in high school and this album dropped, it was the loners, the metal heads who we all saw with the black metallica t-shirts. Talk of drug use and satan worship was whispered in the halls. Whatever. What ass***** most people are in high school. What a shame. How nieve and ignorant we were in those halcyon days (for some of us). For these kids, Metallica spoke for them what they could not say. I'm not a huge fan of metal, but Metallica is quality and really know how to suck you in with their writing and with their music, and I truly believe that Lars Ulrich is the best drummer to ever grab the sticks. He's phenomenal. Everytime I listen to this album, I pretend with all my might that I can play the drums and I bang along at full throttle on whatever flat surface is within reach (my dashboard has taken quite a pounding!!) This is a GREAT (GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!!!) album. Anyone who love and appreciates music will appreciate the work that went in to this album. I cant really say which song on here is my favorite, but \\"One\\" (the best known off the album) is the most moving. And the instrumental work is......mind blowing. Whether you're into hip hop, rap, new wave, punk, whatever, you'll like this album. Listen to it for what it is......a brilliant piece of work by 4 INCREDIBLY TALENTED musicians.
B000063UR2|4.0|Jack lives in a mythical forest with fairies and elves....and so does Princess Lili. One day, he decides to take her to a rare visit to see the unicorns. But there's a problem. There are also a few demons who are after the unicorns as directed by their master, the Lord Of Darkness. If Jack loses the battle and doesn't save the unicorn, the world will become an eteranl ice age, but if he wins, he will also save Lili.  <br /> <br />It's a pretty good fantasy movie....I'm into this kind of stuff.

B000068QY7|4.0|After the falling out over Oasis' psychedelic rock concept album Standing on the Shoulders of Giants seeming to step too far from the roots of rock and roll that Oasis seemed to grow from, there was only one place to go. Back to the ordinary - back to the familiar - back to the Oasis everyone knew and loved - pure, unashamed rock and roll. The release of Familiar To Millions, Oasis' live album and dvd hit that mark. Meshing the new with the old, the live record helped us all remember who Oasis truly is. It may have even reminded the masterminds of rock and roll in the nineties what the fans loved about the band as it is evident in their most recent release (although 3 years old) Heathen Chemistry. This album finds the band returning to their rock and roll roots. However, Liam's taken up writing a bit, just as some of the other members of the band. With Liam's serene Songbird and honest lyrics of Better Man, it frees up space for Noel's rockers like the anthemic Hindu Times and heartfelt Stop Crying Your Heart Out. This album releases that simplistic quality that fans of Oasis have come to love. With their newest album Don't Believe the Truth hitting shelves in a matter of months, the excitement couldn't be much higher after everytyhing Oasis seemingly re-accomplished with their Heathen Chemistry.
B000002JS6|2.0|Most of the songs sond alike,and drag on and onand get extremly anoying.There are three good songs,which are Hells bells,shoot 2 thrill and shook me all night long.Get Bon Scott insteds of this album.
B00068NVI4|1.0|Great show, but if they keep delaying they deserve poor reviews. There is no legitimate reason to wait until less than a week before the already delayed release date to announce yet another delay. This is very very poor irresponsible management.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Bon Scott is the true ACDC singer,and this is a great example.IT's pure great rock  that any ACDC fan would love.This sure as hell shows how much better Bon is than  Brian Jhonson. <br /> <br />It's a long way to the top-Gives me a lot of energy when i listen to it.Good lyrics,rythm and just a great song-10\10 <br />Rock n roll singer-Even better than the last song.The singing is awsome and of course the guitars are top notch. <br />Jack- Never liked it.To dumb and dull-2\10 <br />live wire-What an amazing song.My fav on this album and mabee even my fav ACDC song.Has a fast tempo and a super cool solo. <br />T.N.T-A classic ACDC song.Need i say more-10\10 <br />Can i sit next to u girl-Not bad,but the best.Its pretty catchy but doesn't compare to T.N.T,rock n roll singer or live wire;still good-8\10 <br />little lover-Boring.It drags on and on.It tells a story on how he met his girlfreind at his own concert before he was famous.Thats pretty interesting,but thr song still sucks-4\10 <br />she's got balls-I feel the same about this one as little lover.-4\10 <br />High voltage-Great way to end the cd.About high voltage rock n roll,you can tell by just that that this song will be great-10\10.
0812550706|2.0|This is a totally forgettable book... the plot is ludicrous, the characters lack depth, and, well, it just bored me to tears.  Ender, the Boy-Napoleon, who trains to command vast star fleets by playing the future's version of a zero-gravity paint-ball game... and his brother who gains control of the world by starting-out as an anonymous adolescent blogger. PLEASE!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Seldom does a CD come out where every song is good and I can listen to the whole thing without fast forwarding. This is one of those CDs. It's not like anything Mariah Carey has done before. \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"To the Floor\\" are irresistable dance numbers. Some of the other songs are like Stevie Wonder mixed with Barry White mixed with Roberta Flack--sounds like classic R&B yet updated and original. To sum the CD up in one word--Addicting.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Huge fan of Phantom of the Opera.  Read the original book, have seen the show several times. The movie was an excellant TRY.  I was not as impressed as I thought I would be.  Don't get me wrong it was good but they took from another Phantom story line as well as the show and the original story.  Do Not expect this to be like the show.  It's not.
B0006399FS|2.0|It should have been called \\"All That You've Heard Before\\". One pumped three minute single to start the CD and a bunch of wallpaper to fill it out. While the completist U2 fan will want to add this to their collection, there are too many other great CDs out there for the rest of us to have bought this particular one. Although I haven't heard every last U2 album, this is easily the least of the seven or eight that I've heard. It's assembled all the trademarked sounds and peculiarities that fans have grown to expect but when an album provides all the satisfaction of tap water, sometimes being U2 is not enough.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This is the most unabashedly Gothic, \\"graphic-novel-styled\\" movie in recent years. \\"Underworld\\" is a look into the unseen world of the \\"denizens of the dark\\" (Vampires and Lycans) and their \\"unseen\\" war that have raged over 600 years. Unlike many other \\"vampire\\" or \\"werewolf\\" movie, this one really comes with a large historical background, an intelligently convoluted plot involving Vampire-traditions/law/politics and a Romeo-and-Juliet-like romance to make you feel for the main protagonist of the story. And did I mention that Kate Beckinsale really brings a lot into her role and this movie (not least of which is the fact that she really looks very good as a Gothic, vampire-assassin in leather!). Finally, get the \\"extended version\\" DVD - it's really a lot better.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This movie is worth seeing for the look alone! It is set in a hyper-stylized deco world, very retro-futuristic. <br /> There are very few suprises, plot wise, but not bad acting or script.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Worst  movie ever made you wait for something good to happen and it never does <br />
B0007OCG56|4.0|We all knew Adam could act, but in this film he FINALY sheds the silly Saturday-night-live comedian he has alwasy been and takes on a serious drama role.  His performance is masterful!    But it isn't just Sandler who deserves praise, every single actor in this film absolutely nails the performance, which means director James Brooks really knows his stuff.  Ta Leoni plays Sandler's wife, a human train wreck in motion, and while she is out of touch to the max, somehow we still feel for her and hope she will figure out how to turn things around.  Cloris Leachman plays the drunken mother-in-law who provides comic relief and spouts humorous wisdom at just the right moments. Sarah Steele is the slightly over-weight daughter who suffers from her mother's dysfunction, Paz Vega is the lovely Spanish-only maid with whom Sandler falls in love, and last of all is little Shelbie Bruce, the maids bi-lingual daughter through whom the entire story is told.     Every single one of them is enjoyable to watch and plays a character who is believable and has been well written.  Kudos to them all!    If the film has a drawback it might be the ending, which leaves us hanging as to the fate of this highly dysfunctional family, but in a way the ending is also a little bit refreshing.  Let's admit it... how real are the happy-sappy endings where everyone walks into the sunset and lives happily ever after?    This is certainly one I will be adding to our movie collection.    Enjoy!
0767836324|4.0|The roles of Captain Hook and Peter Pan take on a whole new meaning in \\"Hook.\\" This is probably Spielberg at his best as he delievers us a comedy that kids and adults can enjoy together. I love this film and something tells me it's never going to go out of style.<br /><br />In this you see the classic characters from J.M. Barrie's book come alive-  In this Peter Pan is all grown up, a work-acholic with a wife and children(who is always letting down). Peter and his family decide to go to London as Grandma Wendy(his wife's grandmother)- \\"The Wendy\\" is having a ward dedicated in her name at the children's hospital for her dedicated service to orphans. Well, as Peter leaves his children that night to go to the dedication they are kidnapped by the evil Captain Hook who wants a final show-down between himself and Peter Pan. Peter finds himself bewildered at the children's disapperance. That's when Grandma Wendy tells Peter the truth about who is- Peter Pan- only one problem he dosn't remember any of it and thinks he is having a nervous breakdown as he is wisked away to Neverland by Tinkerbelle- a fairy. Peter must prepare for the battle of his life only a couple of problems- he can't remember anything about Neverland, how to fly, or how fight. So how can he save his children from the evil Captain Hook? And how did Peter Pan manage to grow up?<br /><br />Hook seems more evil in the movie than, he ever did in the story or stage-play. Dustin Hoffman brings a certain villianious flare to the screen and had me terrified of what he was going to do the children. Julia Roberts sparkles as a fairy. By far, Robin Williams was the perfect choice for the role of Peter Pan-for I don't think he has ever really grown-up. The costumes and elaborate sets are interesting to see and the lost boys make this film interesting watch.<br /><br />All in all this film and this timeless story of family, childhood, and adventure will never age- sit down with your children or grandchildren and get hooked on hook!get hooked on hook!
9992939362|4.0|In it's day this was a controversial book.  Now it is a bit of fun nostalgia of days past.  I doubt that anyone buying this book REALLY does so out of a genuine belief in Erich Von Daniken's theories but out of a sense of remembering one's own youthful steps into the \\"unknown\\".  Most of what Mr. Von Daniken puts forth has been disproven since(i.e. they could not read Mayan writing at the time) and sounds silly, but when I was a kid it was fantastic and possible.  I'll buy it just for that.
1552091090|5.0|I bought this book when my oldest was 1 year old.  Now he is thirteen.  I actually was just looking through book lists and came across this book.  It is the most wonderful and moving book.  There still isn't a time where I can't stop myself from crying when I read this book aloud. <br /> <br />It talks about the passage of life and how each one of the stages is to be accepted and understood as the way life is and should be.  If you are a new mother, buy it.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Will Ferrell ruins it for this movie which has a great story idea. Most of Ferrell's comedy routines are no better than immature adolescent antics that are not at all funny and any man taken off the street can act better than he can. That being said, I do not understand how with his lack of abilities he is given the star role in this movie. I also find it ironic that Will Ferrell plays a news anchorman who is not willing to share his anchor desk with a newcomer newswoman, played superbly by Christina Applegate, and like the movie, Will Ferrell is apparently not willing to share the leading role in this movie with Christina Applegate. Applegate is way more funnier than Ferrell, and is a much better actor. This movie is really about her character's story, her struggle to make it as anchorwoman in a world not that long ago where women were not believed to be as smart as men. This movie should have devoted more time on Applegate's character, rather than filling dead time with Ferrell's stupid pranks and follies. I fail to see why the movie is centered around a no-talent like Will Ferrell whose character is not even pivotal in the plot and would have been more effective as a supporting role.    Big thumbs down on Will Ferrell; big thumbs up for Christina Applegate.
1400049628|4.0|This book has a lot of dry humor that I think is great. I couldn't sit through it all at once, but go back to different chapters for a laugh now and then.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I first have to admit that being a DJ makes you tougher on an individual artist's music.  But every now and then there is a CD that you can listen to front to back.  That is rare in these days and times of \\"filler\\" tracks and featured artists.  Mariah simply breaks down the female R&B sector with this one.  She really did her thing.  Kudos to her for breaking out.
0393035158|5.0|_The End of Faith_ is an insightful, well written, and well reasoned exploration of what Sam Harris believes to be a failing of the current rules of civil discourse, namely the taboo of religious criticism.  Harris effectively argues that, with the technological advances of our era, the potential consequences of irrational terrorist violence are unacceptably serious.  He goes on to point out that, in the post 9/11 world, it is irresponsible not to acknowledge the fact that some of this violence can be directly linked to religious belief systems.  Working from this base, Harris makes the case for the need to \\"prosecute a war of ideas\\" in which the very idealogical root of organized terror can be combatted openly, and without shame. <br /> <br />Although Harris' treatment of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is not gentle, neither is it malicious.  Harris does not accuse all persons of faith of being terrorists, but rather, points out that some people will tend to be more adamant in the application of specific articles of faith, and demands, therefore, that we subject these articles to rational scrutiny. <br /> <br />Finally, Harris does not deny the importance of spirituality to the human experience.  He merely makes the case that a rewarding spiritual existence need not require someone to believe things which are irrational, or which have no evidence. <br /> <br />-Matt

B0007NFL18|2.0|OK, 50 Cent is getting really cocky. He hates on everyone. Nas, Ja Rule, Ashanti, my man Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, Kelis, The Game, Jennifer Lopez, Styles P and sometimes even Eminem. Now this isn't a wasted review just to hate but G Unit is wack. I respect Young Buck but he can't rap, Lloyd Banks is worse and he's voice is so annoying. And don't even get me started on Tony Yayo. Olivia is probably a nice enough girl but she cannot sing.     Now on to the Massacre. Don't get me wrong Get Rich Or Die Tryin was a great album, but that was before 50 Cent started  hating on everyone thinking he was God. And yo, The Massacre has 22 songs, but all of the songs except track 22, are all 2min to 3min songs. The basis of his songs are like this. Intro/Hook, Verse 1, Hook, Verse 2, Hook. Then to make it seem like the tracks are longer he puts about 40 seconds of instrumental on the end of the song. And the most of the beats arn't even good. There are only about 3 songs on the album that doesn't use this formula. That's pretty cheap. 50 thinks that cuz he da 'best', he can do whatever s&!**# job he wants. And I dunno what Funkmaster Flex was thinkin, cuz Piggybank isn't a real diss track like the media built it up as. It's more of a comedy track.     OK now that I've done pointing out what's wrong about this album, let's focus on the positive. The intro is pretty well thought out but he should have cut out the beginning where he makes reference to the 'St Valentines Day Massacre'. For those who don't know, 50 was going to release this album on Valentines Day and call it 'St Valentines Day Massacre'. OK, the best songs on the album are In My Hood, first single Candy Shop, A Baltimore Love Thing, Just A Lil' Bit (his next single), God Gave Me Style & Hate It Or Love It Remix. I'm not exactly sure why Hate It Or Love It Remix is included on the Massacre, because it was originally a song by the Game which you can find on The Games album, 'Documentary'. I think it's kinda cheesy what 50 did because The Game is releasing Hate It Or Love It as a single on May 22. 50 Cent doesn't actually have any new verses; he keeps the one he recorded with Game on the original. Because 50 & Game are now enemies (but they have called a truce), Game has re recorded the Hate It Or Love It Remix and stuck Mary J. Blige on the track.     In all, the Massacre sounds pretty rushed and he sticks to the same topic he always does; that is guns, killing, drugs, sex and his hood. The only people buying this album will be 10-12 year old white kids that think 50's cool and the 'best rapper'. Yes of course 50 will outsell everyone and of course this album will be in the top 100 for months and months, but can anyone tell me why he deserves to be???? Peace.
B00030IZY0|5.0|Cyndi Lauper live in Paris - what can I say. One of the best vocal voices in the 80's.   I had seen this on VHS many years ago.  And just recently wondered if you could get this concert either on VHS or DVD.    Being a huge fan of the 80's Cyndi Lauper, This concert is full of enegry and Cyndi when on stage can \\"shake her stuff\\" without losing breath and still be able to hold any long notes.    This is a very rare item, that you cannot find in Australia or New Zealand.  I had always wondered whelther I could find this. And I was over the moon when I recently seen this here on Amazon.      For any die hard Cyndi Lauper fan.  This is a MUST item to have!  I am excitied and I cannot wait to see this concert!  The musicians in this concert are extremely talented, and it show cases some of the best songs of Cyndi's career during the 80's.

0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris rightly argues that it is dangerous for the US public policy agenda to be shaped by irrational religious doctrines. Those who put forward such agendas should be required to demonstrate the same factual evidence in support of their positions that would be expected from any other advocate. They should not have any special immunity from making a case that is grounded on empirical evidence. Moreover, those who make such public policy decisions need to inquire very deeply into the nature of the evidence put forward by those who have a religious agenda.  <br /> <br />That is why I wished that  Harris had  linked his work to the scholarly literature on the origins of Christianity. This  is showing, for instance, that  the New Testament gospels, far from being works  produced by  followers of a historical Jesus, were  works of literature. Moreover the cutting edge findings  in NT  research are showing  that the Gospels  were actually created by the Romans as deliberate literary frauds, and works of war propaganda  to deceive the Jews into worshiping a false, pacifistic messiah.(See for instance Joseph Atwill's new book Caesar's  Messiah, Ulysess  Press, 2005 which updates his previous book The Roman Origins of Christianity) . <br /> <br />It is time for the public policy debate on religion to be integrated with the work of those researchers  who are showing what the New Testament documents really are---which at the moment is ignored as a quiet backwater of Biblical scholarship. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is in the same league with albums like Black In Black , Led Zeppelin IV, and Forty Licks, as some of the Greatest rock Albums ever. The Songs on Nevermind are incredibly good, Starting with Smells Like Teen Spirit( rated in VH1's 200 greatest songs as #1) to Something in The Way with many other great song in between like Come As You Are and Lithium. Also it changed the entire musical outlook almost over night. Plus anyone who says Kurts Lyrics dont make sence obviously arent listining close enough. I'm telling you people, this album just doenst get old, it will forever be a classic album.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|My husband and I adored this movie so much, we immediately went out and bought the widescreen copy. It's is going to be a classic. The acting by all was superb, Crowe is outstanding in this, and Bettany as per usual plays a superb supporting character, that of the ship's medical officer, the outspoken friend of the captain, and a scientifically curious man along the lines of Darwin (who never gets the chance to explore as much as he likes). Normally, this would be a man's movie, just as there are so-called chick films, but I enjoyed this movie just as much as my husband did...and there isn't a single 'chick' in the film. <br /> <br />Outstanding acting and directing. Should have won more awards than it did, but it was competing with Lord of the Rings and other great films. Funny though, Lord of the Rings will be a classic and so will this one, while the other winners from that year will be forgotten! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler

Ages from 17 to mid 50s, both male and female, loved this show.   <br /> <br />As with other shows the characters and their stories developed and grew over the season.  We want to board Serenity again.  We want to find out the answers to all the questions left behind.  We want real stories not slap and tickle TV or mind numbing reality shows. <br /> <br />The great news is the movie will be out in September.  We can't wait but we want more.  We want years of Serenity.
B00018D3JQ|4.0|You're entitled to be skeptical about some French folks doing bossa versions of early 80s new wave songs.  Their recent [...] set will turn you into a believer.  Here's the mood and setting: It's an early '80s sultry evening on Ipanema beach....crickets chirp in the background, and a lonesome helicopter emerges, then disappears across the skyline.... and a girl sings and strums her guitar.  So sit back in your lounge chair, sip your favorite cold and sensuous beverage, and enjoy.

By the way, THERE IS A REASON WHY BANDS LIKE RADIOHEAD, BLUR AND SEVERAL OTHERS NAME DROP PAVEMENT AS MAJOR INFLUENCES.....ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE KNOW NOTHING... <br /> <br />buy this album, appreciate it, and understand that music is not necessarily about big riffs and solos, it is about communicating what comes from  one's heart and imagination....Pavement knew that...they want you to know it too.....

Mariah could have dropped this Album from anywhere between 95-00&I ask what is the difference? the same formula.She might not ever reach the same heights she had back in Her Hey Day in the Early to Mid 90's but at least she should get better Material to showcase Her Instrument way better than this Fast-Food one stop drive thru material She is getting for a Album these days.
6304936362|5.0|I love this movie so much. I was so young when my brother and I first saw this movie, but I fell in love w/ it immediately. This movie has opened my eyes to the ways of war and while I may never fight in a war I can somewhat understand it. This movie brings some of the best actors together (Matthew Modine, D B Sweeney, Sean Astin, Harry Conick JR, Billy Zane, Tate Donavan, and many more.) Every tome I watch this movie I tend to tear up, because I know that things like this happened in real life. My grandfather was real close to this situation, so it very near to my heart. This is such a great \\"war\\" movie. I recommended it to everyone.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|watched this film&It was all over the place. alot of words being pushed around&the film couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be funny or serious in places. it was a waste of film&time.the film was fairly predictable as well to me.
0385512104|5.0|I found this book to be both fun to read and a good learning experience.  The About the Author section of the book says that Mark Haddon has worked with autistic children.  I think it is obvious to anyone reading the book that this is true.<br /><br />The story is very clever with the chapter numbers having their own personality along with every other chapter first pushing the storyline along and then the next chapter talking about something in the past that Christopher wants to talk about.<br /><br />At times I felt that Christopher was a real person and I could see how he would react at things that he was going to encounter.  At other times I was surprised by the results of his experiences.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone for a fun and interesting read.
B000003TAR|5.0|If you're suddenly thrust into stardom and release one of the most acclaimed albums in years, what's next? How do you follow-up \\"Nevermind\\"? (1991) Kurt Cobain and company opted to make a less polished, more aggressive album for their follow-up \\"In Utero.\\" Although \\"In Utero\\" has been universally hailed as a classic, it has always been overshadowed somewhat but its predecessor, \\"Nevermind.\\"<br /><br />Nirvana's writing style, which encompassed the fury and urgency of punk, but the melody and songwriting of the Beatles that made \\"Nevermind\\" so great is very prevalent in \\"In Utero.\\" But this album feels more urgent and aggressive. \\"In Utero\\" is both very raw, and very melodic. It also feels more dejected, and desperate. When you listen to this album, you can feel the torment and the pain in Cobain's voice. When you listen to these songs, you can almost get the sence that this is a young man at the end of his life, and he knows it, or can sence it. \\"In Utero\\" is probably one of the most hauntingly beautiful albums ever recorded. The heart-wrenching closing number \\"All Apologies\\" is actually somewhat painful to listen to.<br /><br />Every song on this album is quite good, and there isn't any filler. Some of Nirvana's best songs are on this album, like the aggressive \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" the mid-tempo 90s classic \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" the anti-rape \\"Rape Me\\" the sarcastic melancholy \\"Dumb\\" and the harrowing \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and finale \\"All Apologies.\\" Kurt Cobain's songwriting never sounded better, which makes this album all the more depressing to listen to.<br /><br />Although this album is overshadowed somewhat by \\"Nevermind,\\" it is as every bit as good. This is easily one of the best albums ever recorded in rock history.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem...not only a pretty look..more than that a nice girl, good actor (to the aussie audience plus) and what a voice!!.

B000005IU2|5.0|After releasing an eponymous debut album in 1969 (produced by former Velvet Underground \\"viola man\\" John Cale), Iggy \\"Stooge\\" Pop and his motley crew of music misfits decided to make music raw and edgy compared to the earlier music of 1969. With the help of producer Don Gallucci (pianist for The Kingsmen, who made \\"Louie Louie\\" in the 1960's), The Stooges succeed in making a spectacular \\"raw\\" album without just recording a few mangy tracks and plastering feedback and distortion on them (like \\"White Light/White Heat\\" by VU):  <br />1.) Down On the Street- A sludgy introduction to this album. The nature of this song fits very well as the album intro.  <br />2.) Loose- A song about sex (\\"I stick it...deep inside\\"). If you analyze the music of this song to the music of the first, then it is basically a faster version of DOTS with different lyrics, but that's OK if you want to make a \\"raw\\" album.  <br />3.) TV Eye- Different melody now, and this is one of the best songs in \\"Fun House\\". It is about having a girlfriend and finding love.  <br />4.) Dirt- A slow, sludgy, seven-minute song about being a loser. It is a very good and the way the cryptic lyrics and music approach you make this a winner. No minute is wasted on this song.  <br />5.) 1970- A song about doing whatever you want in 1970 (when this album is released). Iggy screams \\"I FEEL ALRIGHT! I FEEL ALRIGHT!\\" over and over again against a screeching saxophone.  <br />6.) Fun House- A fun, 7:45-minute song about sex. It is done in a fun manner. The last minutes are done in a jam with Iggy screaming and repeating lyrics in different variations a-la \\"Sister Ray\\" <br />7.) L.A. Blues- Not as good as the songs that precede it. It is an instrumental piece with Iggy screaming like a freak. It fits more as a decoration than a good song. It ends with a wailing siren of feedback that's not annoying. Despite the minimalist nature of the music, it fits very well with the theme of this album and it is a good ending.       <br/> <br />And there you have it. Seven tracks done in a dirty, raw manner and bad production used as good advantage. It does not get annoying like \\"WL/WH\\" and it is a better \\"raw album\\". That, folks, is how punk music began, and it began with a seven-track album of sludge from 1970.
B00004XQP4|2.0|Up until Warning, it seemed Green Day (yes, it's two freakin' words) could do no wrong. Then THIS came out, and everyone started spelling the band's name as one word... and the music on the album was a bore. Either that, or a total rip-off. Right off the bat, the title song rips off the Kinks. Don't know what I mean? Then turn on your television and watch commercials until you come across HP digital television ads. You know the song sounds familiar. The song on the commercial is The Kinks' song \\"Picture Show\\". Billie Joe lifted the song, while inserting his own lyrics. <br /> <br />The only song on Warning that reminds me of the Green Day of yore is \\"Minority\\". But the lyrics and theme are as trite as they get. You REALLY wanna be a minority?! Then get a three-piece business suit, buy yourself a briefcase, don't forget your Bachelor of Science on your way to your Master's in Fine Arts, and live off the land in North Dakota. If you've got a bunch of piercings, tattoos, a lack of ambition, a white-ass complexion, and smoke up all day while you play in a \\"Punk\\" band, then you're the majority of middle America, buddy. <br /> <br />Green Day has officially lost their edge. And as American Idiot proves, no amount of \\"f*cks\\" or \\"f*gs that don't agree\\" can save an album. I think everyone can name a particular album where their once-favorite band started to go stale. And Warning is that album for me. Heck, Green Day were never original to begin with.  <br />

0380789019|4.0|Don't get me wrong--\\"Neverwhere\\" has all of the wonderful mood, characters, and meeting of absurd fantasy that Gaiman fans love about his work.  Gaiman has a truly marvelous gift for completely original ideas and fresh ways of telling stories.  This is definitely a masterful, dark story. <br /> <br />It is fairly obvious that this novel is his first and was born of a visual script (it was a TV show for the BBC before it was a novel).  This is not necessarily a bad thing; indeed, it was been fascinating to watch Gaiman develop as a novelist from a graphic novel & screenplay writer.  While the latter two genres are often maligned as frivilous, writers like Gaiman quietly prove that this is not the case.  Regardless, a novel is not a graphic novel, nor is it a screenplay.  Some readers may not like the more developed, mature craft of \\"American Gods\\" and may find \\"Neverwhere\\" or \\"Stardust\\" more accessible. <br /> <br />Regardless of your literary preferences, \\"Neverwhere\\" is certainly worth checking out.
0393035158|5.0|As the years have passed since September 11th, the books and articles have begun to deal with the more fundamental issues concerning our relations with each other and the rest of the world.  The End of Faith by Sam Harris is a serious and important book for our times.  Unless and until we have a full discussion of the concerns he raises, we will continue to be captives of a world that would rather grasp a faith than utilize our reasoning abilities to solve the many problems we all face.  It is time to insist on this discussion and good preparation for the fight ahead can be found in the pages of The End of Faith.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I went into this movie with low expectations. Half way into it, I hated it. Kate Winslet is completely charming, as usual, and it's a bit of a stretch to think this guy could have been this miserable with her.  Once Jim Carey's character really understood what was happening, and began to fight losing his memories, it became interesting. When the two of them start trying to hide from the process, the story takes on a non-linear, almost poetic turn that is really unexpected and beautiful. There's also a nice subplot about the ways in which the technology is already being abused, and we get a most unexpected ending from an unexpected (Kirsten Dunst) source.<br /><br />I'd say this movie is a must see, because of the originality of the storyline. It feels like one of those movies that will become a measure of cultural literacy - you'll need to know what people mean when they refer to it, and I'm sure they will.<br /><br />The title comes from the poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope, which captures the mood of a lover scorned. Read it at [...]<br /><br />\\" The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br /><br />  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br /><br />  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;\\"
0380715430|4.0|I drove my wife nuts with this book.  Each night as we both lay in bed reading I would interrupt her at least 3-4 times with, \\"Holy cow!  That's where that came from?\\" or \\"So that's what that means!\\"   <br /> <br />For anyone who fancies themself a wordsmith or loves language or even enjoys knowing why things are the way they are \\"The Mother Tongue\\" is a gem.  You'll find yourself scratching your head and thinking, \\"There are people who keep track of this stuff?\\"  At the same time you are so grateful that they did. <br /> <br />Bryson has an engaging and familiar feel to his writing.  Very enjoyable to read with a knack for explaining the things you always wanted to understand.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I saw no redeeming qualities in this film. It took every situation to such a ridiculous extreme that the point was lost. For example, the scene where the mother receives shock treatments. Nice bit of horror, but completely unrealistic - they don't treat people that way-- they put them to sleep-- and showing it as if  she'd be awake and aware is cheap theatrics that reflect poorly on the director. It's not as if you have to embellish the realities of heroin addiction - its bad enough without without the exaggeration.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|This album is kind of over-rated. It was weird to here a guy do that music with the Dance type music. It was still a nice CD and it is one that I like but it is not as good as people say.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Wow - art within art within art - a grand love story, a political commentary, a love letter to an artist, and homage to her vision - Julie Taymor and Selma Hayek have done Frida proud in this film. Be sure and get the book about the making of the movie [aisn: 1557045402] to accompany the DVD.<br /><br />The cinematography is stunning. The performances are flawless. The way the live action is interwoven with adaptations of Kahlo's paintings is inspired. If you've ever been to Mexico, this will have you aching to go back - you can taste the fruit and feel the sun and the colors. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars - this is the one to get for any lover of art, woman of vision, or for a person who struggles to find meaning in pain or disability.
0375701427|4.0|Two questions are involved with this book.  What is the perfect path for a life, and if that path is followed what lies in store?  The first question is not explored too deeply, but the supposition is put forth that the values of the 40's & 50's will suffice: diligence in work, committment to family, humility, and good will toward your fellow man.  Who can argue with that?  It turns out that almost every character in the book argues with that in the form of various assaults on the Swede who embodies these values.   <br /> <br />The second question is more interesting and is the real focus of the book.  If you follow the narrow path and obtain the higher rewards, there is a whole new category tragedy.  Most of us are ignored by our neighbors as we wallow in relatively similar depths of failure.  However, if one struggles free to a level of modest success, the neighbors take notice and jealousies are aroused.  A self-made success is a shaming figure to the mass of humanity, and shame does not sit well.   <br /> <br />Tragedies are typically written to give warning about a type of action taken by the protagonist (e.g. don't sleep with your mother).  Here the indictment is on those surrounding the afflicted.  American Pastoral states that not only is the mass of humanity too apathetic to obtain the higher rewards, rather, the only time humanity can be motivated is to obliterate the reminders that such higher rewards exist.
6305212112|5.0|I first saw Fried Green Tomatoes with my mom a few months ago and I immediatley fell in love with this movie. It's definitley a movie that can reach out to many people of different age groups, for example I'm only 16 and I love it. It's a really touching story with adventure, plenty of humor and a lot of sad and triumphent times. I'm not going to go into a huge plot synopsis since that's already on the site lol, but I avidly suggest this movie. I'm thinking about buying the book as well I've heard it was great as well. All I can say is watch this movie! You'll fall in love with Ruth, Idgie, Big George, Sypsie and immediatley hate characters such as Frank Bennet. This movie is one of few that really make me feel for the characters you will love this movie.

0767810856|5.0|I got the fortune of watching this movie when it was reraned on Showtime. I never liked anything I seen that had Nicolas Cage, but watching this movie made me change my mind about the guy. This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Another solid 1990s love story, where wins and loss of lottery doesn't change a person's attitude.
B00005JNRB|4.0|The film lives up loyally to its title, it's as barren as the Sahara. But if you're not expecting a meticulous rendition of Cussler's novel this is certainly a fun weekend caper. You have seen these fierce explosions and wild deus ex machina twists before, but that's what disposable action thrillers are about, aren't they?<br /><br />The adult cast may trick you into thinking the script was done by grown-ups too. Names like Dirk Pitt and the overall premise should swiftly dispel those suspicions -- an ironclad ship from the Civil War is buried beneath the sands of the Sahara, having ventured there 150 years ago but must now be found.<br /><br />Two diametrically opposed male leads are called to the task, one a six-pack toting macho stud and the other a shrimpy blunderbuss, but that doesn't a film make so we roll out a red mat for a Ms. Hotpants played by Penelope Cruz, who, surprise surprise, indulges in some choice moments with the macho man while saving the planet from a deadly nuclear chemical.<br /><br />I'm not surprised reviewers are drawing analogies to the other doozy thriller from recent memory, National Treasure, which at least played its cards with lilting pace.<br /><br />Yet I must admit that for all its obvious flaws this desert adventure doesn't suck as much as it could have. The Saharan context could have used more African influence on the soundtrack (which as it stands is a forgettable jumble of 70s rock) but at least it doesn't star Jean Claud Van Damme.<br /><br />That alone makes it worth the price of admission.
B00025ETIW|2.0|More suicidal than linkin park, even more whiney than green day, it's my chemical romance! Why do people think it's cool for bands to cry their problems into an album like this and call them an inspiration??? If you ask me, you'd have pay me to listen to this cd that's nothing more than a collective pitty party. If anyone out there spent precious money on this, do us sain people a favor and don't bother us!
1860498825|5.0|I decided to give this book a read after it made a critics 'top 10' list.  Thus I picked up the book blind, having no idea who the author was nor what the premise of the included.  Having just finished the book I can honestly say I was not disappointed.<br />Waters manages to capture the sights and sounds of Victorian England quite well. Details are richly rendered, and each character is developed such that the reader feels like they can almost reach out and touch them.  Progressing through the book, the reader is left with a very different impression of what Victorian England might have looked like, as say compared to how Dickens's might have portrayed it.<br />Waters also does a fantastic job of keeping the reader on edge.  Plot turns and twists ensure that this is one book the reader will not want to put down.  Anyone who is interested in books centered around Victorian England, and/or who like books where the unexpected is almost the expected, should definitely give this book a read.
B00028HBKM|5.0|There are NO words to describe how WONDERFULL this movie is! NONE!So why do i review if there's no words to say?... simply because this is the BEST movie EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER made!! This IS life , Jesus Christ and our Father God!!! Amazingly done, thank you Mel Gibson and thank you Jim Caviesel!! And the rest who worked on this miracle film!!  <br />I PRAY THAT IT WILL LIVE AND CHANGE LIVES FOREVER MORE!!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice for all and Raining blood by slayer are the best metal albums ever created so here is my review of RIDE THE LIGHTNING it was made in 1984 and was 'tallica's second album <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire with Fire (8.5/10) <br />Really Fast opening song but starts out with an acoustic beginning. Song is about the Counterblow of a nuculear war hence the name fight fire with fire. <br /> <br />2. Ride The Lightning (9/10) <br />title track a true metal masterpeice it is one of the more stronger songs on here. it is obviously about electric chair execution but doesnt exactly protest it since James is actually for the death penalty(good for him) unfortunately Dave Mustaine wrote some of the lyrics before he was fired, so beware some of the lyrics are a little cheesy in a mustaine kind of way. It also has one of the best solos ever. <br /> <br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls (9/10) <br />This song is fast with a nice rythm to it, the lyrics are great like just about every song james writes. This song is about a battle from a h.p. lovecraft story and some spanish civil war battle. The song could have been longer and the ending is a little boring but still a good song. This song is especially good live. <br /> <br />4. Fade to Black   (10/10) <br />The first power ballad Metallica ever did, lyrically its the best song on the album and the riffs are excellent especially at the end of the song. One of the best songs on here. The song obviously deals with Suicidal feelings, but was written when the guys were pissed and sad about fans stealing all their equipment on the kill 'em all for one tour in '83. <br /> <br />5. Trapped Under Ice (8/10) <br />A short but fast as hell song about drowning under ice as the title clearly tells you. This song is very underrated by alot of the fans, i like it alot. <br /> <br />6. Escape (7.5/10) <br />By far the weakest song on the album but definelty not a bad song. I'm not completely sure what this song is about but i think it has to do with either escaping from prison or being rebellious and different from what others expect from you. <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death   (10/10) <br />My Favorite song on the album without question, It is a very fast paced song with no let up. I love the par where james yells die by my hand etc. the riff in it is so sweet. Its a favorite to hear live especially during the die, die, die part becuz all of the fans start to chant it while james sings the die by my hand i creep across the land killing first born men part. The song is about the angel of death sent by god that kills the pharoahs son in the bible. <br /> <br />8. Call of Ktulu  (9/10) <br />My second favorite instrumental that metallica has done right after To Live is To die on the justice album, the lead guitar and drums are awesome in call of ktulu. <br /> <br />Overall i give this album a 10/10 it is pretty much perfect and Fade to Black, Creeping Death, Bells, Call, Fire, and Ride pic up all the slack Ice and escape leave even though those songs are not too bad.
B000000W5L|5.0|As a fan who fell in love with the Stones during the early 1970's and has been following them ever since, I have to go out on a limb and say that if I were stranded on a deserted island and I had to have one Stones album with me--this is it! This record has got it all. It is the Stones at their peak and is a textbook lesson on why they are the greatest rock and roll band in the world (to quote Get Yer Ya Yas Out). It is funny that when this 2 set record was first released, it garnered very mixed reviews. Somehow, Exile's reputation has grown over the years. And I also think that this is one of those rare instances where the album, like a fine wine, has aged magnificantly! The Stones try their hand at a lot of different musical styles on this record, and it works. This album is a classic and certainly belongs in any serious rock collection...
B000059LGC|5.0|I just can't get enough of peter Ustinov as the famous Christie detective Hercule Poirot.  I was introduced to this and Evil Under The Sun as a kid by a good friend of mine and I gotta say that I still love these movies.  Are they the best movies ever made?  No.  Are they a great introduction to Agatha Christie?  Hell, yes!  Sure, there are some minor glitches and a few over-the-top acting faux pas, but overall, this is a great movie.  Ustinov, Angela Lansbury, Betty Davis . . . the list goes on and on.  Great performances by all.  So just sit back and take this movie for what it is, good clean murder and mystery!!!
8402094163|3.0|When I first read this book around ten years ago I was struck at the outset by Hemingway's reference to W H Hudson's 'The Purple Land'. This was just a coincidence to me as Hudson is one of my favourite authors.<br /><br />I partially enjoyed the novel for its open easy-to-read style, but there was too much drinking in it for me (written in prohibition years?), and bull-fighting is not at all to my liking. I'm also not that comfortable with women who - despite regret later on - realise they have treated some men of their acquaintance particularly badly. But the mystery of what happened to Jake (ever so 'funny' but causing him to cry himself to sleep) and why it keeps he and Brett apart is so tantalising. The coincidental reflection in the clinging of Robert Cohn to Brett adds significant pathos.<br /><br />And now I read the novel again and there is another author mentioned midway through - a name that meant nothing to me on my first reading - Ivan Turgenev. This is getting to be too much of a coincidence!! Anyone who has read my reviews of the last year will have noticed that I have recently 'discovered' Turgenev and was very moved by the four novels that I read in fairly quick succession. And in Turgenev - but structured completely differently (Russian eyes compared to Western eyes?) - we find this same separation of men and women who perhaps never should have been separated.<br /><br />Now there is another book I simply must read - it will be my second Hemingway novel. Apparently he wrote a novel called 'The Torrents of Spring.' Strange really, as one of the Turgenev novels I read was called 'Spring Torrents'!!!<br /><br />other recommended books:<br />'First Love' - I Turgenev<br />'Spring Torrents' - I Turgenev<br />'The Purple Land' - W H Hudson<br />'Long Ago and Far Away' - W H Hudson<br />'Under Western Eyes' - Joseph Conrad
B000286S8S|3.0|Okay...let's get real here.  In the begining there was Van Halen and it was good and in this phenominal band the focus remained not on the bass player or the drummer, who could have been anyone, but a lad named Eddie Van Halen who could play a guitar just like ringing a bell and a sassy frontman named David Lee Roth.  And . . . like I said . . . it was good.  Hell, it was great!  Listen to the first four Van Halen albums and tell me there's a band out there that reinvented rock and roll the way they did!  Huh?  I can't hear you?  And the blessed fruits of Van Halen ran on and everything was right with the world.  Now... enter the Serpent.  You can feel the change on Diver Down.  The way the first four albums were recorded live, with f*ck-ups and all, that was not the case with the track-heavy, playing-time-light Diver Down.  Was popularity breaking down the big machine that was the greatest rock band in history?  I think so.  1984 cemented the lid on the coffin that was commercial success.  Panama and Jump and Hot For Teacher were the funeral dirge of the Van Halen entity.  Clashing egos.  Bitching spouses.  Movie dreams and solo outings.  David Lee Roth splits from the group and in walks Sammy . . .  Okay.  Now I was fourteen when all this happened and I gotta tell you, I sided with Dave.  Who was this geek with the guitar, kissing Eddie's ass all over the place and singing David Lee Roth tunes?  I couldn't abide by the Van Halen-Lite version of the band with massive keyboard melodies and catchy, chick-song ballads.  Had the VH brothers gone insane?  I stuck with the wildman.  So now, all these years later, here we have yet another Best Of... set.  Sure, the songs are all remastered, and they sound f*cking great!  And even the Sammy songs are a little nostalgic all these years later.  It's after the war and the casualties have all been buried for a long time.  So whose side are we on now?  Seems like a moot point.  But the fact that Diamond Dave helped start this mega-successful band and they treat him like a footnoe just ain't right.  Let's face it, before Gary there was Sammy and before the dawn of time there was David Lee Roth, on of the greatest frontmen/showmen of all time in rock and roll history.  Bad blood and booze binges aside, you can't undercut the historic significance of DLR.  Are the VH boys still pissed at him...maybe so.  If that's the case, it's rather sad, but without DLR would Van Halen have been as popular?  Sure Eddie is one of the greatest guitarists ever, but could he have carried the band?  I don't think so and neither should you, if you have half a brain.  So the question is, really, do we need another Dave vs. Sammy compilation?  No.  Why don't the VH boys and that whiskey-sippin' bass player of theirs pick a friggin' frontman and stick with him and make some new music that's worth our while.  Or has the light of brilliance dimmed way too far to be rekindled.  You can't buy back the past, but you shouldn't shut the door on it either!  Long live David Lee Roth and Sammy Haggar and hell, Van Halen.  'Cause I've been to the edge, and there I stood and looked down . . .ega-successful band and they treat him like a footnoe just ain't right.  Let's face it, before Gary there was Sammy and before the dawn of time there was David Lee Roth, on of the greatest frontmen/showmen of all time in rock and roll history.

Or has the light of brilliance dimmed way too far to be rekindled.  You can't buy back the past, but you shouldn't shut the door on it either!  Long live David Lee Roth and Sammy Haggar and hell, Van Halen.  'Cause I've been to the edge, and there I stood and looked down . . .

B000006Z1X|4.0|Okay, being a geek extraordinaire, Graham Bonnet has played with Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Yngwie J. Malmsteen, and now, Stevie Vai.  What is the deal?  Can anyone guess?  Well, after The Ynger bailed out of Alcatrazz to absorb himself and his inflating ego into a mediocre solor career (and a really cool heroin habit) in walks former Frank Zappa guitarist, Steve Vai.  Now Alcatrazz goes off on a different direction, perhaps they were thinking they sounded more commercial and would be successful where the Yngwie-driven unit faltered.  Not so.  They remained obscure even with the bad MTV video for God Blessed Video.  Horrors continue to unfold . . . Anyway.  Here we have a long since out-of-print gem with Stevie Vai showing his prowess in the guitar seat.  Lighter Shade of Green is great!  Mercy.  Stripper.  Wire and Wood.  All in all this is an off balanced record due to the fact that you have another great guitar player in a thown-together band.  Never gonna work.  In walks Danny Johnson.....
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Enemy of God is a great solid effort from Kreator. This release if full of killer guitar riffs, blasting drums, its just totally kick a**! Favorite tracks are Enemy of God, Impossible Brutality, and Dystopia. This is how real thrash is done, f*** Metallica's St. Anger!!!
6305922756|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the funniest send-ups of the Metal/Hard Rock genre you will ever see!  I say that with complete absence of guilt.  Marty Dibergi (Rob Reiner) takes us on this wondrous Rockumentary with England's Loudest Band the now-legendary Spinal Tap.  When they were filming this movie back in 1982, people in Los Angeles thought that they were really a band that had been together for years and years.  Great!  The subtle humor enforced in this flick is genuinely hysterical.  I have never laughed as hard.  To see it come to DVD in this deluxe edition with all the deleted scenes and inventive commentary by the boyz in the band.  Perfection!  You will never be sorry for buying this DVD, in fact, it should be a must for your collection.  Aside from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and maybe Young Frankenstein, I'd say this is one of my favorite comedies of all time.  And just remember this . . . dozens of people spontaneously combust every year, it's just not widely reported.  Enough said.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is Kate's \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"!  If you're not a Kate Bush fan, it will sound weird, but give it a few listens.  There are so many textures and layers - the production is simply amazing.  You have to turn it up loud, that's the way it was made to be played.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Having read the reviews and understanding that some fans are pissed off at the new versions of the three original Trilogy films, we need to step back for a few minutes and take a deep breath.  First things first . . . Is somone holding a blaster to your melon, forcing you to put your hard-earned dollars into Mr. Lucas' bank account?  Nope.  So I think the major resolution to the issues of revamping the Trilogy break down pretty easily into this:  If you don't like it, don't (...) buy it!  Bottom line.  Now that that's out of the way, let us explore the possibilities.  Sure, I liked it when Han just straight up wasted Greedo in the original films when I was a wee lad of seven.  Hell, that was what made Han Solo so friggin' cool.  Rebel.  This close to the galactic version of Dirty Harry.  And sure, did I need to see that geek, freak, whining (...)of an Anakin Christian whatever-his-name-is in the original movies?  Hell, no.  That borders on blasphemy.  Seeing these movies in the theaters as I was growing up bordered on a religious experience, and screwing with the originals makes my flesh creep.  But, we gotta look at it the other way.  Apparently Mr. Lucas doesn't want the originals back on the market in DVD format.  Now we can do one of three things about it.  By the Malaysian bootlegs off of E-bay or stand around and (...)like a bunch of whiny Star Wars geeks or we can buy this revamped version of the Trilogy and lump it.  There are the choices.  I didn't say you had to like them.  But the picture quality is great!  And the sound is fabulous!  And the documentary is superb on the 4th disc . . . so suck it up and buy it and keep your memories of the originals in your mind for selfish nostalgia.  All in all, the changes aren't as bad as all that.  This is just the 1997 Special Editions with three or four more tweakings.  Lucas apparently will never feel that the first three Star Wars flick will ever be done to his liking.  Whatever . . .
B0002DKCMG|4.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It was so unbelievably well made, great writers. I'm not going to get into why I love the movie so much for fear of divulging too much about it to someone who hasn't seen it as of yet, but take my word for it and see this movie. This is definitely worthy of everyone's DVD collection.<br />As a side note, the unrated version of the DVD isn't all it's cracked up to be, and it's basically the same as the original.
034911675X|2.0|I decided to read this book for a couple of reasons:  My wife had heard a lot of good things about it and I normally love books about Africa or set in Africa as I have spent quite a bit of time there.<br /><br />Unfortunately what I found in this book was a poorly written, boring story with no plot.  I certainly don't get what so many people seem to see in this book.  Wilbur Smith it is not.<br /><br />I certainly don't recommend it.
B0002X314C|5.0|i love every single track on this cd. a matter a fact, i getting married next year, i found my wedding song on this cd. STAY WITH YOU. this song actually discribed my feeling for my girlfriend. if you buy this cd, you won't be disappointed, 100% garantee. thank u
B0007MAO0M|5.0|I PURCHASED THE GIFT 2 DISC SET THIS MONTH TO ADD TO MY COLECTION OF WESTERN MOVIES. WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE! THE BRILLIANT CRAFT OF FILM MAKING HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER DEMONSTRATED. THE FILM HAS A VISUAL LUSTRE THAT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE AND THIS IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION. I SIMPLY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD RATE THIS MOVIE BADLY AND HAVING NEVER SEEN THE FILM BEFORE, I AM INVIGORATED ABOUT THE ART OF MOVIE MAKING. <br />THE BONUS STUFF IS GOOD AND THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE MAKING OF SILVERADO IS INSPIRING...JUST BUY IT, IN YEARS TO COME IT WILL BE A TREASURE <br /> <br />JOHN ALLDRED <br />NEW ZEALAND
B00003CXXP|3.0|This thoughtful film raises the question: What happens as our technilogical capacities outrun our moral evolution? Specifically, what happens when we create a boy robot who is programmed to love but we don't have the moral development and responsibility to address the robot's needs? The film shows what happens when such a boy robot, used as a replacement for the loss of a couple's \\"real\\" boy, is no longer deemed useful, and actually quite dangerous, and is sent away into exile where he must fend for himself in a world that is rendered cruel and abominable. The film does an excellent job of creating hell on earth. The film also does a good job of showing the robot boy's quest to be a \\"real\\" human and shows how in our technlogical age we have cruel contempt for this race of robots and discard them the way we dump our computers every three years or so. Since we wouldn't care for the boy robot or the other film's robots unless they existed, at least on some level, as human, we must ask if the robots are sympathetic and humanized sufficiently in the script. I say yes. The film succeeds at making the robot race credible as a metaphor for the way we treat the misfits, the underclass, and all those helpless people we exploit at our own convenience.<br /><br />So why only three stars? Because after 100 minutes of gripping drama, the film descends into a 45 minute sermon on the human race's moral failings. The script keeps clubbing us over the head with a pompous sanctimonious voice over, spoken in a pretentious British accent, that goes on and on about the human race's \\"failed experiment.\\"<br /><br />For two better films about the moral struggles we face with technlogy, I recommend  Gattaca and Brazil.
B0007GAERG|2.0|Before I write my review, let me clear a few things up.  I LOVE Mariah Carey.  I've endured the laughs from friends, spent hours defending her, have at my disposal all of her bizarre trivia facts, and often tell anyone who will listen that the only mammal that can hit a note higher than Mariah Carey is a dolphin. <br /> <br />That said, this album is just okay.  I'm not a hater - I'm a person with ears and the ability to distinguish between my love for an artist and the mediocrity of her work.  Mariah's whispery vocals on her previous albums were done for good reason - her voice isn't what it used to be.  She sounds frighteningly like Jessica Simpson on this disc - lots of airy screaming and desperate, scratchy straining of the vocal chords.  In an attempt to prove she's still got it, Carey screams and shouts her heart out, but she doesn't ever really sing.  \\"Mine Again\\" is painful to listen to; I feel bad for her (and myself) when that track plays because she is so desperately trying to command respect but is instead inspiring pity. <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, there are a few good beats and, in fact, a few stellar tracks - \\"We Belong Together\\" is an amazing song, probably one of her best - but overall the disc plays like a compilation of rappers occasionally featuring a banshee who sounds sort of like Mariah Carey. <br /> <br />Lastly, her use of the whistle register - my favorite of Mariah's tricks - is completely out of control.  She gratuitously slaps it all over these tracks when it is almost always entirely inappropriate.  Someone (maybe a vocal coach) needs to talk to her, because this CD is largely a waste of talent.
B0002858YS|4.0|The only reason I bought this CD was because I had seen the video for Mr. Brightside and loved the sound. I hesitated to buy a CD for just one song...you know how that usually turns out. I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I are very nostalgic for the old 80s sound (its pretty much all we listen to) and this brings back all those old memories and sounds. Just bought it today, but I think it will be getting lots of play time at our house. Give it a try!
079073804X|5.0|A great little update of sorts for The Exorcist, featuring a half hour documentary [Very intriguing, especially if you liked the movie] on the making of the movie with interviews from the cast and crew. Now on to the movie itself, which is great of course. For any horror fan, this has to be considered as the ultimate movie. Upon seeing it again years later, I still get goosebumps and I can't imagine people laughing at it in recent screenings. It has and is no comedy.     The female leads are excellent, particularly Linda Blair in the infamous role as Reagan, the possessed child. Mercedes Mcambridge is excellent in the horrific role as the demon's voice, and Ellen Burstyn gives a very believeable and respectable performance as the obviously distressed mother. The priests as well, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are also excellent. However, if you take offense to or have very strong religous beliefs, then this movie may offend you. Just a warning.     The famous parts of this movie are the effects [Spinning head, demonic face, flying vomit and then some], and the excellent score all around. The effects still hold up well today, although the shock value has obviously been lessened. The score itself is chilling, the best since Psycho. Jack Nitzche does an excellent job with it and should have been awarded for his work. The novel has been excellently adapted to fit the screen by Blatty, the screenplay is believeable and excellent, and the novel is another must for any fans of the horror genre.     Overall, the scares in this movie are frequent and the very thought alone can scare some people. I'd say rent it for any real movie fan, but don't say I didn't warn you if you think its over the top. To me however, this movie is perfect and could not have been made better, and I hope others can recognize the talent and hardwork that went into this movie.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp was brillant as Barrie and the cinematography in this film was beyond words. Definetely a movie for adults, this movie takes you into the life of Barrie and the fantasy world he creates for a widow and her young boys.<br /><br />You will need alot of kleenex as the movie hits the mid point and most of the ending your vision will be blurry for the tears but it is impeccably done. It is one of the BEST movies I've seen in a long time.
0385336810|4.0|To be honest I choose my books by covers. Lots of people say it doesn't work but it really does work for me. I saw this book lying there waiting for me to pick it up. Out of all the books that were lying there, the bright pink just caught my attention. This isn't the only reason I'm recommanding it. <br /> <br />The intro with her telling us some of the secrets... WOW that was great idea of getting the reader's attention. All my friends went to get ther book. Also the complicating story of which you don't hear much. Most books have the same concept of what happens in the end and meaning. but this book had a whole new idea. A WHOLE NEW IDEA which no one has come upon yet. <br /> <br />I really shouldn't be spoiling this book but here's a little preview to it :  <br />Secrets she wouldn't share with anyone in the world: My G-string hurts me. I have no idea what NATO stands for. Or even what it is. <br />Until she spills them all to a handsome stranger on a plane. At leas, she thought he was a stranger... <br />But come Monday morning, Emma's office is abuzz about the arrival of Jack Harper, the company's elusive CEO. Suddenly Emma is face-to-face with the stranger from the plane, a man who knows every single humiliating detail about her. Things couldn't possibly get worse. Until they do... <br /> <br />This book kept me away for a whole night and I'm re reading it now. I HIGHLY recommand this book!:D
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I saw one epsiode last year when i was on holidays in the States, and automatically i got hooked. When i got home i jumped on amazon and ordred the first season. I found my self wrapped up in the world of everwood, the relationships weren't far fetched but very believable. My parents and soon after my whole family ended up seeing it,my dad watched the entire season and loved it(which is incredible cause he hates any show with teenagers in it). A year later we finally have it here on tv in Australia,(even if it is only on saturday afternoon). And now myself and my mum have all our friends hooked on it. <br />Please hurry up and release season two, as there is a small fan group down under :) <br />Taleah. Sydney,Australia
B000002UA0|4.0|It's pretty obvious this album was done in the psychedelic sixties.  Still, it's fascination to hear Pink Floyd under the creative direction of someone other than Roger Waters or David Gilmour.  The centerpiece of this album is the bizarre guitar oddesey Barrett takes, pulling sounds out of his instrument one might not think possible. <br /> <br />The album's best offering is the long, rambling \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\"
B00000GAIW|4.0|I'm going to have to disagree with every rock critic on this one, especially Rolling Stone (idiots). This isn't Tull's best album, it is one of their best, but definetly not their best. There is lots of better J-Tull albums, like \\"Benefit\\", \\"Living In The Past\\", \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" etc. And Aqualung is not their best song, Jesus! \\"Teacher\\", \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\", \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\", \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\", may I continue? Didn't think so. Aqualung does have some of my favorite tracks on it, but once again it's not their best.

B000007S5B|5.0|This is probably my fave Doors album aside from Strange Days and their debut album. Every song on this album is excellent aside from two.\\"Hello, I Love You\\" is a bit too poppy for me and \\"Summers Almost Gone is kinda boring but, then you have songs like, \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\", \\"My Wild Love\\", \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\". Jim Morrison is one of my idols and is probably the greatest lead singer of all time, only rivaled by Robert Plant and Ozzy.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I have followed Yes for over 20 years.  Although this is worth collecting because of Rick Wakeman's involvement, I have to say many of the performances were a bit weak.  This is probably the case since it was recorded during later part of the tour.  I don't wish to be picky here, only that I hold Yes up to their musical performance heritage.  All of them even looked extreemly tired and probably led to the year of in 2005.  I am still giving it a 5 star at any regards because I still support their efforts.  They may not have the $$ to put on a stage presentation as was in the past, but it is good to know they still perform.  We need a new album of material (If they can get into a room with a producer)<br /><br />-David Carlin, Philly
B000002J0B|5.0|This has to be my favorite Zeppelin recordings, not that every song is my favorite, but the fact they didn't try to make an album with another \\"Stairway\\". Almost every song on this album is awesome. The only song/songs i wouldn't give a full score of a 10/10 would be \\"The Crunge\\". It just isn't Zeppelin. But nonetheless, you have the one and only, \\"No Quarter\\". Seriously, if they (Zeppelin) released this as a single or if they(the idiot capitolist radio jocks)played the song on the radio, i'm sure it would be another \\"Stairway\\". Great song, great album
1932100385|5.0|Diet For A New America by John Robbins got our family started on a mostly vegetarian diet back in 1987. Now Colin Campbell takes it to the next level and tells us what we should have been told years ago....that it is within our power to prevent or improve our health through our diet; and he has decades of experience and extensive research to back up his claims. This information needs to get to the people, because the powers that be (the meat, dairy, and medical industries) have been working very hard to keep this information from us for years and years. <br /> <br />Thanks to Colin Campbell and his son Tom for having the courage to write this book. I am extremely grateful.
B000002JSN|5.0|I don't own this album (unfourtunately) but I know that this is Zeppelin's best album after \\"HOTH\\". I only know maybe ten tracks from this album. I am listening to \\"Ten Years Gone\\" as we speak or write, whatever, for the first time and it blowed my mind. \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" is one of my favorite tunes of all time. \\"Kashmir\\" i could forget, but \\"trampled Under Foot' is so rich and funky it's insane. I'm not really familiar with the second disc, but I plan on buying this epic masterpeice this week, so I'll probably change my review, for the better of course.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars is definitly on its way to be one of the best shows ever. Veronica Mars is witty, spunky, and everything a teenage detective should be. As soon as this show starts I am glued to the T.V. This show has sex, mystery, and murder. Making it an excellent show. People need to spread the word about Vernonica Mars. Now that the second season will come I'm eager for the first season to come in DVD. So I can see it all over it again a million times. Veronica Mars is the best show and I enocurage you to watch it ! It is on UPN tuesdays at 9:00 pm time.
B000002UAR|5.0|C'mon, i know Sgt.Pepper changed the way people look at a band with studio albums, but if The Beatles didn't record Revolver, there would be no Sgt.Pepper. You have songs like \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"Love You To\\", \\"She Said She Said\\", and \\"Get To Get You Into My Life\\". This is psychedelia without being too much drenched in acid. I know there is no such thing as too psychedelic, but, Sgt.Pepper somewhat gives me a headache. Lennon was becoming sloppy as a songwriter and wasn't really in a normal state of mind, as with Revolver he just started dropping units of sweet ol' LSD and he was in his trippidelic prime. And then you have Paul's \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", George's \\"Taxman\\" and Ringo's \\"Yellow Submarine\\". The Beatles' best, no doubt in my alterded state of mind.

B000002UAU|5.0|There's plenty of reason for 27 straight weeks in the number one spot and four grammy awards. The songwriting, engineering and visual artistry were not so much ahead of their time, but rose above the standard, while doing something only classical musicians had tried to do before 1967, make a timeless definitive statement.     Most popular and most mentioned songs people note, include With a Little Help from My Friends, When I'm Sixty-Four, and the darker A Day in the Life.    I was always taken with the contemplative She's Leaving Home and Fixing a Hole.    One thing I like about my CD re-release over my original LP (aside from the fact the LP is worn out) is that I can program out Good Morning and Lovely Rita Meter Maid. With those two gone, I enjoy the album almost as much as I do Abbey Road.

068987474X|5.0|More than a year ago, Not Just Friends hit the shelves and I thought it was the answer to all my relationship questions... so there's something about the words \\"not\\" and \\"just\\" in a title that seems to hit the hot button of my own personal relationship problems. I could save a lot of time, energy, money and just forget about men altogether. Then my book would be called Not Just Batteries, if you know what I mean. So... to the point... I have shelves and shelves of non-fiction self help books and I'm not just kidding you. This book by far has had the greatest impact on my life. Seriously. Who would have thought, it's so simple. But, the message is... Sweety, you deserve a real man, a real relationship, and anything less is only a pile of bs. Every woman who reads this book will have an epiphany that she will wish she had had ten or twenty years earlier. BUY THIS BOOK... and then if you can afford to... Buy a copy for every heterosexual woman you know.

0767836286|4.0|I can still remember ARLINGTON ROAD surprising me the first time I watched it.  The film sets you up to expect a kind of everyday, run-of-the-mill, suburban thriller.  But then, as Jeff Bridges descends into a passionate mission to discover the truth about his next-door neighbor, fueled by an intense yearning to honor his wife by studying the \\"underground\\" factions in the United States, the film develops into something unusual, intelligent, and exciting.  While the acting performance of Bridges tends to get a little over the top and heavy-handed (as it often does in other films), his intensity seems strangely appropriate for this film.  As the plot thickens and begins to burn, the audience is fueled by Bridges's emotion and anger, leading all the way up to the film's incredible climax.  Seriously folks, the ending is pretty killer and forces you to think back over the entire film.<br /><br />This film is not \\"leftist\\" propaganda and it is not a film that attacks the outer limits of the conservative right.  Director Mark Pellington manages to achieve a sense of moral ambiguity.  On the one hand, we feel for Jeff Bridges: we experience his anger at the government's lack of competence in dealing with violent acts of terrorism.  We too feel frustrated by the government's attempt to pacify its citizens and instill a sense of security.  On the other hand, we shy away from the extremist tendencies of Tim Robbins and understand a need to change the system from within.  A lack of responsibility and morality in government does not warrant a violent response against unsuspecting civilians.  You will spend time rooting for both sides in this film, if only a little bit.  I highly recommend ARLINGTON ROAD to anyone who enjoys an intelligent thriller.

6303379214|5.0|Norman Jewison created this warm and airy ode to love, giving it both the beauty and fragrance of a flower cart on the cobbled streets of Italy. The scenery will take your breath away and the story make you smile in this light romantic comedy.     The always sweet and engaging Marisa Tomei is Faith, on the verge of marriage when a phone call from her fiance's friend will stop her dead in her tracks, simply because his name is Damon Bradley. A game played when she was a child and a Gypsy fortune teller at a carnival in her teens told her the man she would love and marry would be named, Damon Bradley.     Bonnie Hunt shines as Faith's sister-in-law and best friend, who takes off to Venice with her in search of her destiny, written in the stars. When they discover Damon Bradley has left the hotel he called from, the search will go from Venice to Rome, and on to the lovely Italian coast, as Norman Jewison gives us a gorgeous view of romantic Italy.     Robert Downey Jr. is at his most charming as Damon Bradley, who Faith meets by chance, or perhaps fate, and falls in love with. Faith will discover, however, that destiny has a few twists and turns in store for her, in this truly delightful violin concerto to love.     This film will work its magic on you if you enjoy a light romantic comedy with a 1950's feel, and will surely become one of your favorites if you are seeing it for the first time. Those who enjoy films like \\"Roman Holiday\\" and \\"Three Coins in the Fountain\\" will welcome this romantic postcard from beautiful Italy with open arms and grateful hearts.    Marisa Tomei gives a performance both vibrant and full of magic. This refreshing and wonderful film for romantics is widely available in various VHS and DVD editions. Don't let destiny, or this film, pass you by.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Listening to the emancipated Mariah takes me back to  my teeny bopper days of blow pops and bobby socks. Would someone please tell Mimi she is stuck in a time warp. Not to mention, lose that ridiculous gitty smile.  It's like that is sooooooo juvenile, We Belong Together drove me away from the CD player. Mariah might land at #1, understandably so, Beyonce is on hiatus and 50 had his run, so what would one expect. It's not likely MIMI will dismount her high horse and face the fact she is \\"current\\" but Ciara, Beyonce, Faith, Amerie, the young ones is what's happening.

0140157352|4.0|Getting to Yes is a book that focuses on negotiation techniques you can use to get a fair deal without sacrificing the relationship.<br /><br />Fisher and Ury give some excellent advice for negotiation such as focusing on the problem and interests, not digging yourself into a position, how to handle overpowering and dirty negotiators, and work on problem solving by creating options.<br /><br />I was mostly impressed by the author's description of how to maintain integrity without giving in.  I was also impressed with the step-by-step scenario they had of the negotiation with the landlord that had charged over the rent control limit.<br /><br />On the down side, I really wished there were more examples in this book.  While there certainly were a few, I was left wanting more in order to understand the techniques given.  Also I found some of the language to be dry, but this is not a huge issue.<br /><br />Getting to Yes is definitely a book you want to read and we all have to negotiate at some point in our lives.  4 out of 5 stars.
B000001ELD|3.0|Of the four Kiss solo releases issued in 1978, Gene Simmons' album was certainly the most eclectic of the lot. Rather than relying on his demon character as well as the riff rockers he wrote with Kiss, Gene's solo album resembled more of a fan getting to play all the music that he loves. While not everything works and the production is overwhelming at times, there are a few gems to be found. Simply put, Gene's at his best here when his songs are reminiscent of Lennon/McCartney. \\"Mr. Make Believe\\", \\"Man of 1000 Faces\\", and \\"See You Tonight\\" are beautiful songs written in the Beatles vein that would have been classics if not marred by the strings which clutter the tracks. The tracks \\"Radioactive\\", \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", \\"Living In Sin\\", and \\"True Confessions\\" are good rock n' roll songs which sound straight out of the early-60's with their inclusion of piano and female backing vocals. Songs such as \\"Burning Up With Fever\\" and \\"Always Near You/Nowhere to Hide\\" sound very reminscent of the late-70's with their funk leanings and are decent as well. There's also a version of \\"See You In Your Dreams\\" which he did much better with Kiss on the Rock and Roll Over album. Finally, there's Gene's version of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" and no, it's not well done. Overall, this is a solid effort containing three great tunes similar to the Beatles, a few decent songs, and a whole lot of indulgence. \\"See You Tonight\\" is also on Kiss' MTV Unplugged and is a much stronger version. Although Gene's solo album is only the 3rd best of the lot behind Ace Frehley's and Paul Stanley's releases, it's still light years better than Peter Criss' solo album.
B00079018K|1.0|I hate to rate this album that bad as the music is really great but you can't listen to it on your mp 3 player without going through all kinds of trouble getting around the copy protection. What does the record company expect ? Make people who already bought the album download the songs again for a buck each if they want to listen to them on their portables. Not me. Boycott this album !!
B0000399WI|5.0|Knowing that 750 reviews were written for this film as of today, I still have to write this because I watched this film so many times while I was learning how to speak English, coming from another country when I was old enough to face difficuties learning another language. I turned the caption on, rewinded, played, repeated the words aloud, and then watched the same thing again to the extent that I still remember many of scripts.<br /><br />The Shawshank Redemption was not the only movie I used for language practice, but I had chosen it because I simply loved it! The more I watched it, the more I understood the story. No matter how careful I was watching, anytime I watched it I always noticed some detail that I didn't notice the previous time I watched it. That is because the movie is carefully made in detail so that this movie can tolerate being watched over and over again.<br /><br />In 1998, I got to the point where I know who says what at what timing, so I stopped watching it. In other words the movie now exists within me that I don't need to see it. I really digested it, and the Shawshank Redemption became a part of me. It took years for me to find some of the jokes in the film funny as I became familiar with American culture and its language (especially slangs).<br /><br />Acting is worderful. Music is wonderful. Photography is wonderful. It's just a wonderful movie!
0380789035|3.0|Gaiman's roots are in comic books, and it shows. His characters talk in sharp, witty bursts and each scene is colourful, striking and whole. Some of the settings are memorable; he doesn't linger on description but gives it one good paragraph and moves on. Usually that paragraph is exceptional - like the astonishing coldness of Lakeside or the gold light of dusk in Cairo. But towards the end of the book I felt that these decorations had disguised its hollowness. The various gods came to represent nothing more than mechanisms of a clever plot; it was like a Dan Brown novel, only with far better ability with language. The unsettling subject of faith and human psychology was dealt with only briefly in a few interludes (such as the Irish woman and her glasses of milk, or the African woman and her shrivelled arm). Gaiman preferred to focus on how clever Wednesday was in the end; his creativity with Shadow was far more ambitious, but ironically never got away from the problem that Shadow as a character faced himself - that he had no personality to speak of.<br /><br />Readers should buy this book for its plotting, its spectacular linguistic originality, and its educated exploration of US religions, origins and distinctive American places. But those looking for wisdom and mental stimulation should not get their hopes up.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman is simply amazing. I saw it on the big screen the week it came out, and I'm glad I spent every penny. It will not disappoint you. <br /> <br />I am a life-long fan of Spiderman, everything from the comics too the old cartoons. This movie puts all else to shame. It is full of action and suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Thrilling and stunning. <br /> <br />The action in this movie is what makes it so great. Stylized. The movie also goes out setting perfect room for it's sequel, Spiderman 2. (Spiderman 3 comes out may 2007). While I do have to say that the sequel, Spiderman 2, is much better than the first, this one is still a five star movie that surpasses other superhero movies (i.e. - the Hulk, Daredevil, Catwoman). <br /> <br />A full five out of five review. I own this movie and I'm glad I bought it. I would strongly advise you to do the same if you're a fan of this genre even in the slightest.
B0007OCG56|2.0|Is it just me or does this movie seem to drag on and on?  I was expecting more from the director of \\"Broadcast News.\\" That was an excellent movie and this is not.  Adam Sandler should stick to comedy. This movie didn't come together like it could have. It was disappointing.  The only bright spots were the acting of young maid and her daughter.  Cloris Leachman is not a funny drunk, she is a stupid drunk.  Let's not glorify drinking for the young kids, OK? <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005ATZT|4.0|The Fugitive is a heart-pounding thriller that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat! This is what some might consider a classic, but it is also so much more. <br /> <br />This movie is full of both action and suspense. There are twists and turns throughout this movie that are unexpected, which makes it all the better. Take the one armed man, for example...(I'll say no more regarding that) <br /> <br />The character development and the portrayal of the characters in this movie also struck me as excellent. <br /> <br />The reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is that there wasn't anything special. The plot in this story is about as typical as it can get. Man is accused of murdering his wife, but he didn't. He's now a fugitive running from the law, set on getting revenge and proving himself innocent. Folks, it doesn't get any more bland than that.
B000002OHX|5.0|Wishbone Ash have often been called the English Allman Brothers and there are quite a few outward similarities. Two great live bands each with two superb guitarists and a tight, driving rhythm section cranking out music that acknowledges it's roots while constantly going beyond them. But while the roots of the early Allmans(before the untimely death of brother Duane)were firmly in Southern blues, Wishbone Ash finds their inspiration in the pre-Christian mysticism and eerie melodies found in English folk music. But make no mistake about it, this is tight, driving rock n' roll delivered by one of the best live bands of the 70's. If you go for guitar driven rock with a distinctly English flavor Live Dates will become one of your all time favorites.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie, as it is one of those movies that are well made, but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man, the son of God, is simply hard to see. <br /> <br />As a movie, there isn't much to this. However, this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately, as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch, thus the \\"R\\" rating. <br /> <br />I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment, don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though, simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Its most definitely safe to say that Mariah Carey's glory days are officially over! Mariah comes back with the \\"club banga\\" Ciara-influenced \\"Its Like That\\" which didn't make much of a spark as her fans would have hoped. Yeah, peaking at #15 for radio airplay may have been an improvement from what her singles did last time but its nothing to sing about. Her voice sounds whiny & shrieky and the whole album just sounds like B-sides from \\"Charmbracelet\\" & \\"Rainbow\\"...try again.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie, though enjoyable, is deffinately below the standards set by the actual Harry Potter Books by J. K. Rowling. There are some good effects, but the movie in itself is rather kiddish. Deffinatly enjoyable, but not a really blockbuster. <br /> <br />I did enjoy it, but I would suggest renting it before actual purchase. The following two movies are deffinatly better than this one.
B000001Y16|5.0|As far as his music was concerned, I was never a big Tupac fan: you know, I was more the person who knew his music but never purchased the material. I appreciated Tupac more for his lovable persona, his sunshine-like smile, and his undeniable charisma, the latter of which drew EVERYONE near to him, even those who hated him. I don't care who you were, Tupac had that type of charisma that business people dream of attaining: he spoke to the hearts of women, lifting them up (\\"Keep Your Head Up\\"), addressed societal ills (\\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\"), and left behind an insurmountable string of #1 hits (which is too many to list).<br /><br />However, when he passed and his last contractual album was released (a month after his death) under Death Row, critics slammed \\"The Don Killamunati: The 7 Day Theory,\\" - this was one of those times when the streets spoke, in the face of the music journalists who, at the end of the day, don't have a clue what they're writing or talking about.<br /><br />\\"The Don Killamunati: The 7 Day Theory\\" IS A CLASSIC - this is an undisputable fact. It has all of the ingredients that constitute a classic hip hop album: dope production, introspective, heart-felt, diary-like lyrics, a commanding vocal presence, a minimal amount of guest appearances, guests who don't detract from the overall cohesiveness of the album, no extraneous interludes, and it's relatively short (which is a good thing because most rap albums are TOO long).<br /><br />The first of many posthumous releases, this album has \\"eerie\\" written all over it. Purported to have been recorded by Tupac in just 7 days, the second title to this disc, \\"7 Day Theory,\\" also has a shade of religious meaning. Theologically, 7 is the number of completeness or perfection. In that sense, \\"The Don Killamunati\\" was properly named. Adding to the eeriness, \\"Killamunati\\" is an undenialbe reference to the illuminati, which are mysterious orders of unknown individuals claiming cryptic and esoteric enlightenment of the \\"last days.\\"<br /><br />Doning the alias of the famous Italian political figure of the Renaissance, Niccol&oacute; Machiavelli (but spelled 'Makaveli'), Tupac dives back into the political persona he abandoned early in his career, as his thug took precedence. Perhaps assuming the name of a historical political figure was a purposeful move; after all, combined with the demanding presence of his celebrity status, whether purposeful or unconsciously executed, this was a masterful move.<br /><br />This is arguably the album that initiated the fanatical claims of Tupac's deified messiah-like status (as well as the never-ending production of 2Pac mixtapes which still burns today), which is understandable - \\"Don Killamunati\\" exhibits a plethora of religious overtones, including informal prayers, conversational monologues with God, eschatological metaphors, and apocalyptic warnings of repentence.<br /><br />Not to mention, the cover to this album displays Tupac crucified on a cross, unquestionably perpetuating the deification of one of hip hop's greatest. Even today, we have legions of fans eagerly awaiting his \\"return,\\" genuflecting to every subsequent album that has been released since his departure.<br /><br />Even through his dangerous and tumultuous lifestyle, Tupac was no doubt a very spiritual and devout follower of Jesus, who was obviously a monumental archetype he subsequently tried to emulate throughout his life. This album offers glimpses into Tupac's thoughts which are, at times, so intense, you may find yourself staring at something for minutes in deep thought, or possibly on the verge of tears. Blacks will definately appreciate Tupac delving into his socio-political afrocentricity, addressing the \\"black man's burden\\" on the song \\"White Man's World.\\"<br /><br />An example of the lyrical intensity displayed on this album is on one of my favorite songs from this release. On the song \\"Krazy,\\" guest Bad Azz offers a very truthful and humbling anecdote:<br /><br />\\"'Dear life...who has the answers ?' I wonder.<br /><br />I turn to my elders, they aged and experienced,<br /><br />but they can't even tell ya;<br /><br />Or they tell me there'll be light at the end of the road,<br /><br />'cause they don't even know.\\"<br /><br />I LOVE this album; I only have a handful of albums that I would deem classic, and this one definitely deserves that title. I don't have any other albums by Tupac except for this one, and I cherish it. It contains club songs, laid-back joints, gangsta songs, spiritual songs, everything. I give \\"The Don Killamunati: The 7 Day Theory\\" the HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.anecdote:  <br /> <br />\\"'Dear life...who has the answers ?'

B00005JN0T|5.0|This is honestly one of my all time favorite movies. I simply love it. I don't buy many DVDs, but I bought this one. A personal favorite. <br /> <br />I, Robot is full of action with pure sci-fi fascination throughout. Though the \\"I\\" in I, Robot is not the central theme of this movie version, I don't think that's critical. I think Will Smith was the best actor to be chosen for this film. It is well directed and has great effects. <br /> <br />Not only is the plot to this movie great, but it is full of mystery and some unexpected twists. Full, head-on entertainment. <br /> <br />While the plot of this movie is similar to the hundreds of others (i.e. Terminator, The Matrix, etc), I think this one is purely original, especially in the plot aspect of the movie. There is pure action which will keep you glued to your seat. Suspenseful, as well as including a touch of humor. <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend this DVD. Great actors, great director, great story, great movie.
0805076476|5.0|After seeing the film the first time I was blown away.  I went straight to Amazon to find the book.  I knew nothing of Palahniuk and was overjoyed to find so many other titles.  Now I own the majority of his works and I cannot wait for Haunted.  Thank Amazon for being able to pre-order new material.  For anyone that was in my shoes...Fight Club is a fantastic read as are all of Palahniuk's works.  BUY THEM ALL!!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I think that this movie verson of J.K. Rowlings second \\"Harry Potter\\" instalment is much better. The first one was okay, but there wasn't much action. This one is full of mystery and puzzles to be solved. <br /> <br />The relationships and character development involved in this grow significantly from the first version, the first film. While I would recommend this to all ages, I would also classify it more of a kids/family movie. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this film was amazing and, unlike the first DVD, it lived up to my expectations.
B0007GAERG|3.0|If you want to hear \\"The Voice\\" minus the rappers check out Faith Evans - First Lady.  Your ears should be pleased.
B00005JMAH|3.0|While I wouldn't go as far to call this movie \\"bad\\", I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed with it. I saw this in the theater, and I recall leaving the building thinking I can't believe I spent 7.50 to see THAT! <br /> <br /> <br />I was anxious to see how this movie would turn out because of the new director, Alfonso Cuaron. I have to say that I think he's the reason this came out so bad. Many of the camera shots just didn't fit the mood. Also, many things are different from the first movie and the book. For example, there's two sub-characters, Crab and Goyle. In the book and the first movie they're rather heavy and chunky. In this third movie one is as thin as stick. Minor things like that. <br /> <br />There was also the new Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon. While I don't think he did as bad a job as the director, I was a bit disappointed with the change. It wasn't bad acting, but rather, difference (yet again). He talked to fast compared to comparisons with movie/book. <br /> <br />I would suggest renting this if you are following the movie series, but if not, I wouldn't. I will, since I am a fan of Harry Potter, see the next movie, the fourth book, when it comes out. I simply hope that the director does a better job than this one. <br />
B0007WZUMO|5.0|Your are going to be blown away,this 2005 album of the year!!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This film was silly beyond belief, visually mind popping and contained extremely stilted performances, but I eventually bought into this CGI dominated world once I grasped that nothing (and I mean NOTHING) was going to be realistic in the teensiest, weensiest, way. KUDOS to GP for keeping her hairdo straight, after flying upside down in a plane, being chased by giant robots and traveling to Nepal with apparently only carry-on luggage-which she lost by the way. That's some hairspray!!!    It was part Raiders of the Lost Ark,part Buck Rodgers, a sliver of Bring Em' Back Alive with a little Tales of the Gold Monkey and The Matrix thrown in.  The music kept making me think it was Batman.     I think I recognized the still photos they used of L.O.-although of course in real life he was standing next to his wife and not a pyscho ninja robot.   What a great idea of using him for the villian, although I was disappointed that they didn't find a way to make him more a part of the film.  I mean, the film WAS about how advanced the technology of filmmaking really is. The studios produce the impossible and we believe. But robots are a dime a dozen. I wanted to see more of the bad guy.   Has anyone read \\"Remake\\" by Connie Willis.  Check out this book to see the future of CGI.      On the plus side, I loved Dex, even if the Sky Captain did treat him like a dog and I would have loved to see a scene between Dex and Frankie.  I had the impression that they had a bit of a past just like Joe and Polly.       What?  No kiss at the end???  Polly's expression WAS priceless however.       Grab some popcorn, stop looking for a plot and watch this film.  If you go into it with the right expectations you'll enjoy it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|When I read all the nasty reviews, I think of \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and I try not to worry about all the hate. It's a very uplifting and moving song and a great closer for the album. I try to take peace in knowing that despite all the jealousy, that Mariah has truly found herself on this CD. For the first time her voice seems exhilarated and free. Every single song reminds me of why I bought her very first album. There's just something about her voice that takes my breath away. This is now one of my favorite CD's ever. <br /> <br />\\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (chorus) <br /> <br />Fly like a bird <br />Take to the sky <br />I need you now Lord <br />Carry me high <br />Don't let the world break me tonight <br />I need the strength of you by my side <br />Sometimes this life can be so cold <br />I pray you'll come carry me home <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|It was Longest Recording periods for Mariah Carey <br /> <br />Previous HUGE fan of myself, i know that her voice somehow <br />faded. but with this album she bring that like 80% of early 90's <br /> <br />Some people expecting stuff like early 90's, please move on. <br />any other artist can't survive, doing same material for a decade <br /> <br />Also i'm happy to see the result that now some how she did <br />fit in Trendy R&B format, well still some of stuff is just <br />un-exceptable, but it is worth to listen <br /> <br />I really getting hooked on We Belong Together & Mine Again. <br />Lyrics are absolutely touching & moving. <br /> <br />And for the last, Even Beyonce' is not original. since when <br />she was original ? she is from Destiny's Child rip-off version <br />of Copy version music videos of TLC <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|this album is great her voice is the best, the beats are wonderful also. Each song show why mariah is THE VOICE!.. Stop hatin' the album is one her best. Get the album u will not be wrong! my FAV. ARE WE BELONG TOGETHER, SHAKE IT OFF, MINE AGAIN, STAY THE NIGHT, ONE & ONLY, CIRCLES, YOUR GIRL, JOY RIDE, FLY LIKE A BIRD. HER VOICE WILL BLOW U AWAY.
B0007TKH66|4.0|Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action \\"Star Trek\\" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original \\"Star Trek\\" series, which ran between 1966 and 1969) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film \\"Star Trek VIII: First Contact\\".   <br /> <br />The new series, entitled \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" debuted in the fall of 2001, only months after the previous \\"Star Trek\\" series, \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" concluded its seven-year run.  The show's series premiere, entitled \\"Broken Bow\\", began with the appearance of a Klingon on Earth following a mishap long before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.  To return the Klingon back to his home world, Capt. Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show \\"Quantum Leap\\", that ran between 1989-1993), gets permission from Starfleet to take the experimental starship named Enterprise, with serial number NX-01, to Kronos, in spite of the misgivings from Vulcans, who don't believe that mankind is sufficiently prepared to begin exploring other worlds and encounter more alien species.  The NX-01 is the first man-made starship capable of traveling at a speed of warp 5.  Capt. Archer then assembles the rest of his crew for the new Enterprise, including the non-human Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), the Vulcan Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).  With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the premiere episode, it initially appeared that UPN, which broadcasted the show, would have another successful \\"Star Trek\\" series, just as it had with \\"Star Trek Voyager\\".  Unfortunately, subsequently shows had much smaller audiences that only continued to shrink with each season. The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  It was during the fourth season that UPN decided to cancel the series, even though there were still another three seasons to be produced because the fourth season ratings dropped even further to 3.1 million viewers per episode. <br /> <br />The question, then, is why did \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 \\"Star Trek\\" fans living in the U.S.A.?  Personally, I believe several factors are responsible.  First, the only truly interesting characters were Dr. Phlox and T'Pol.  The characters of Reed and Trip were often annoying.  However, the most annoying character during the first season was Capt. Archer himself, who repeatedly acted like an arrogant uninvited guest towards every alien species and outpost encountered.  Second, the inclusion of the previously unknown species called the Suliban and the notion of a \\"temporal cold war\\" from the far distant future ran tangent to the notion that \\"Enterprise\\" was supposed to be a prequel leading up to the time of Capt. Kirk.  Third, the technology and overall look of the NX-01 often appeared more advanced than what was used in the original 1966-1969 \\"Star Trek\\" series, which is supposed to be 100 years more advanced than \\"Enterprise\\".  Fourth, insufficient attention was given to portraying the various extraterrestrial races responsible for for forming the United Federation of Planets: the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Tellarites, and the Alpha Centauris; as well as to other races known during Capt. Kirk's time.  Though the Vulcans were a frequent race depicted in the first season of \\"Enterprise\\", the only other future founding race of the United Federation of Planets were theAndorians, which appeared in only two first-season episodes: \\"The Andorian Incident\\" and \\"Shadows of P'Jem\\".  The blame for these various factors that directly contributed to the premature cancellation of \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" rests solely with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Unfortunately, the addition of producer Manny Coto who did an amazing job of reconnected the fourth season of \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" to the rest of the \\"Star Trek\\" TV series came too late to save the show. <br /> <br />Of the 26 episodes the comprise the first season of \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\", the most memorable were \\"Broken Arrow\\", \\"Fight or Flight\\", \\"Strange New World\\", \\"Unexpected\\", \\"Terra Nova\\", \\"The Andorian Incident\\", \\"Breaking the Ice\\", \\"Civilization\\", \\"Fortunate Son\\", \\"Silent Enemy\\", \\"Dear Doctor\\" (one of the best first-season episodes), \\"Sleeping Dogs\\", \\"Shadows of P'Jem\\", \\"Oasis\\", \\"Two Days and Two Nights\\" and season finale \\"Shockwave, Part 1\\".  One disappointing episode was \\"Fusion\\", which appeared to contradict descriptions from other \\"Star Trek\\" TV series that Vulcans had always practiced mind melds; as was the episode \\"Acquisition\\", which included the Ferengi: a species that had only been introduced in \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", 200 years later. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the first season of \\"Star Trek Enterprise\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was an interesting experiment that had it been given more time, probably would have blossomed into a far better series thanks to the efforts of Manny Coto.
B000002UAR|5.0|i would agree that this album is the beatles trying to get to SGT. PEPPER'S [and some of the songs on MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR]. i'd rate this album below SGT. PEPPER'S, much of THE MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, THE WHITE ALBUM, and ABBEY ROAD. this, of course, is hardly an insult. no album collection is complete w/out this.  <br /> <br />'taxman' and 'i want to tell you' are two of harrison's greatest songs [probably his greatest work outside THE WHITE ALBUM and ABBEY ROAD]. 'love you to', though, isn't nearly as good as 'within you without you', which is a very similar song [found on SGT. PEPPER'S].  <br />'eleanor rigby' and 'for no one' are two of paul's best songs. they, also, could be the best songs on the album. 'eleanor rigby' is almost certainly the best.  <br />'i'm only sleeping' is the most quaint lennon song i can think of off the top of my head. 'and you bird can sing' is great GREAT fun. 'tomorrow never knows' is john getting his feet wet, quite impressively, for future standouts like 'a day in the life' and 'strawberry fields forever' [the two best beatles' songs in my opinion].  <br />'yellow submarine' is, infamously, a great sing along song.  <br /> <br />i'd say that this album would be the equivalent to bob dylan's BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME - SGT. PEPPER'S would be comarable dylan's HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED. for those that haven't heard the dylan albums, i'll try to explain what i mean. BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME had dylan trying to find his sound in rock; as a result, the sound isn't perfectly refined, but the rawness isn't a drawback. REVOLVER had the beatles' trying to find their experimental sound that they'd perfect on SGT. PEPPER'S.  <br /> <br />now BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME isn't as good as HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, and REVOLVER isn't as good as SGT. PEPPER'S. but REVOLVER is absolutely essential and inspired.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA had been made before Moulin Rouge or Chicago it would have been more deserving Oscars awards.<br /><br />With so many memorable songs, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work by far. Since Phantom, however, his musicals Sunset Boulevard, The Beautiful Game, and most recently, The Woman in White, have been less then memorable; you can hardly recall a humable tune.<br /><br />THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a beautifully made film and it is sure to stand the test of time. Of course, it would have been wonderful to have Michael Crawford star as the Phantom, but no point crying over split milk. Gerard Bulter is a great alternative choice and he has added a certain sexual tension that I haven't seen in other Phantoms. However, I think most would agree with me, if the Phantom is so attractive like Gerard why would Christine go for Raul?<br /><br />Butler's recording is adequate but I did find myself holding my breath when he reached his high notes and that does distract me from the film. As for the female lead Emmy Rossum, she was an understandable choice.  As much as I like Sarah Brightman's voice, the part is for a much younger actress, especially when one's face is magnified so many times on the screen. I read in an interview that Emmy said she was too big for the small screen ( TV ) . She did look good on the big screen and she can sing too. Both Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry and Minnie Driver as Carlotta were perfectly cast. ( I am only disappointed that they gave Minnie the chance to sing the new added song at the Oscars. But that's show business for you ).<br /><br />At the opening of the film, when the stagelights came up and the first few bars are played, I hadn't felt so excited in a long time. Joel Schumacher did a fantastic job in directing this film . It is beautifully made and my only complaint is Phantom's face (  his scars ) is not very consistence.<br /><br />I hope this film will not discourage film makers from investing in more musical films such as Sunset Boulevard. But this time please use one of the star from the musical. In this case, Glen Close, is the perfect `Norma'. She was acclaimed for the role, and while a little young perhaps, she is bankable and she has the voice.<br /><br />I will be watching THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, the film, again and again. And I hope when you come to London you will go and see this forever number 1 West End musical. For more details go to [...]such as Sunset Boulevard.

B0007P3582|4.0|50's Release is a 3.5 effort at best, i have it at 4 Stars obviously because you are unable to rank it as a 3.5 which is understandable.. anyway \\"The Massacre\\" will definately appeal to people out there with a good taste of Club Music due to album mainly relying on the beats, which are great no doubt. But his rapping and flow and lyrics are the big flaws in \\"The Massacre\\", and this was the same problem with \\"Beg for Mercy\\", production was all good, but the actual style of rapping was off. but this is what happens, Hip-Hop is changing and 50 cent is just taking advantage of the situation. so fair enough, good on him. But it still doesn't hide the fact that this isnt that great and also that 50 didn't perform to the best of his abilities, a few standout tracks like the hit \\"Candyshop\\" \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" \\"Outta Control\\" \\"Get in My Car\\" \\"Ski Mask Way\\" \\"My Toy Soldier\\" and \\"Build You Up\\" and also a few bad tracks which include \\"Gattman & Robbin\\" \\"So Amazing\\" \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" and \\"Gunz Come Out\\" really sum up this half decent 'n' half bad album. <br />G-Unit fans already own this more likely, so i'll just recommend it to the New age Hip-Hop fans. 3.5/5
B00006LLNU|5.0|Where do I start with Sigur Ros? They are one of the most original and though-provoking bands of the past decade, and this album shows why. () is a collecion of 8 beautiful and moving songs, like if Radiohead quit making pop songs and started to play with an orchestra. The lyrics are sung in a made-up language, which is both strange and familiar. Track 1 is the one that is the most famous on here, and it's a good opener. Dark piano and organ give way to a string quartet and a lot of vocals. After that, we go from slow funeral marches to uplifting soundscapes back down into depressing slowcore. It's an incredible album, and it's one that everyone should own. 5 stars for these strange folk from overseas.
B00005NGAL|3.0|I am a big fan of musicals and theater in general. And I wanted to like Cats. And to be fair, the show has same great moments. But I noticed many times during my viewing of this DVD that my attention kept drifting elsewhere, and that is rare for me. The show just feels like a hodgepodge of disconnected events with no real rhyme or reason -- it is clearly focused more on showcasing flashy costumes, a few impressive dance tricks, and some special effects than on telling a story. Unfortunately, considering how generally unimpressive the dance is, it's hard to imagine anyone being interested in the show without a great deal more interest in dance than your average person. This all adds up to a mystery why this show retains its title as longest running show on broadway (although it will likely be overtaken soon by Phantom of the Opera, giving me greater faith in the theather-going public).    Then again, perhaps the show is more interesting live (though my sister did say she fell asleep when she went to see it).    I really can't recommend this one. The good moments it has are very, very good, but in between them are long stretches that are hard to stay interested in.    (And if I hear the word \\"jellicle\\" one more time, I am going to have to find a kitten and hurt it -- which brings up another point about this quasi-musical...the songs are really repetitive).
B0000C1733|5.0|People r always saying they missed so many songs on this CD but there wrong. the cover says GREATEST HITS not BEST OF. The were right on for the greatest hits except for the new songs. Anthony, chad, john,(dave for one hot minute), and flea are great musicians and this is all of their major highlight of their careers.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|Oh yeah this is a masterpiece of jazz rock fusion in the epic style of 70's album rock. It is so artistic! I admit the first 1033 times I listened to it I didn't like it but I kept listening for new things each time because- wow it is one LONG PIECE!!!! Well maybe it isn't that good I thought, but then I realized how long it was- wow! You have to listen to this at least 1000 times before you really understand how amazing it is. Those who don't like this should listen more carefully because they are probably missing something, I would suggest locking yourself away for a month or so and listening to it or studying it carefully. Because the first four-hundred times you listen to something your not supposed to like it anyway.
B00005JMXX|4.0|This is not the best acted, and it's certainly not the best scripted film I've ever seen.  But for the first time, one of Mr. Emmerich's offerings was so involving visually, that I was able to overlook the giant size plot holes, and the characters that seemingly came out of a box somewhere.  This isn't any less ludicrous that Independence Day, or certainly Godzilla, but for once, the images were powerful enough to let me power my brain down for the afternoon and just sit back and watch the pretty colors. <br /> <br />Do not go into this movie expecting high art.  But, in Gene Siskel's old maxim, it is more interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch, and it's from that perspective that my inner film geek finds peace with his enthusiam.
B00003CXDB|3.0|Not having a strong interest or knowledge in the world of stocks and bonds, WALL STREET failed to provide me with a satisfying cinematic experience.  Though I have been a fan of Michael Douglas for some time, it seems strange that he won an Oscar for a film in which he has little real screen time.  Most of the movie focuses on Charlie Sheen's character, and even though Douglas is perfect in the role of Gordon Gekko, I wasn't overwhelmed by his performance.  He won that year over William Hurt (Broadcast News); Marcello Mastroianni (Dark Eyes), Jack Nicholson (Ironweed) and Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam).  Assuredly, Douglas embodied the corporate greed of Gekko, but it is ultimately a one note performance, without any shadings of real personality.  Charlie, meanwhile, in one of his first major roles, is only about 50% effective, and his power comes in the scenes he shares with his father, Martin, who played his father in the film.  There are nice supporting turns from James Karen as the duplicitous sales manager; John C. McGinley as Charlie's sometime buddy broker; Terence Stamp as Gekko's British rival; James Spader as a yuppie lawyer; and of course Martin as Charlie's father whom he betrays.  Daryl Hannah is awful in a one-note role as Douglas' ex-mistress and Sheen's current honey.  Sixties ingenue Millie Perkins has an all too brief cameo as Charlie's mother in the final ten minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's movies have always been provocative and WALL STREET is no different.  But I have always found myself disturbed by his movies in that they are not the most \\"entertaining\\" of films; there's always a message, and this time, the one that \\"greed is good\\" just doesn't fill the bill for me.  Michael Douglas has given enough great performances that this Oscar to me rewards his body of work rather than this one role.

B0007Y4USW|4.0|Let me say this right off the bat, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", is by far the best MC album since 1995's Daydream. The reason for this is because of it's smooth 70's soul vibe, excluding three uptempo tracks. The singing is beautiful and melodic throughout the album; vintage Mariah. All of the other pop stars out there, (i.e.) J.Lo, Britney, Beyonce, Christina and whoever else......take notes on how to make a phenomenal album. Not only does this girl write her own lyrics, she can't be touch in the vocal department. I'm probably one off the biggest Mariah fans on this Earth, and this album blew me away. The standout tracks on the album are: \\"We Belong Together\\", this ballad is beautiful and hard-hitting. J.D. produced one of the best songs of his career on this one. Peep her name-checking of Babyface and Bobby Womack. \\"Stay the Night\\", Mariah belts out some pleading lyrics over Kanye's bed of melodic piano keys. Hopefully they'll do more tracks together. \\"One and Only\\", Mariah gets her stacatto flow on here, while maintaining her breathy whisper...very phenomenal. Twista is up to his usual antics; he has to be the greatest feature emcee ever! \\"Circles\\" is plain and simple the best song on the album. Mariah lays some heart-wrenching vocals over a beautiful track. I've never heard anything so heavenly. I can relate to the lyrics of the song, which makes the song that much deeper. \\"Mine Again\\" is the quintissential 70's soul song. This track is a slow burner; you'll get lost in it. Simply put, this album is a treasure. Besides the songs, \\"Get Your Number\\" w/J.D. and \\"To The Floor\\" w/Nelly, Mariah delivers perfection. Go out and get this album from the beautiful, and best female vocalist alive. No one can do it like she can......no one.
0385510454|3.0|I wanted to like this book, and I did like it, sort of. But it was a slow read and ultimately not worth the time I put into it.<br /><br />The story is about a Washington D.C. dealmaker/lobbyist/lawyer, the broker of the title. Grisham seemed to pushing the broker nickname pretty hard in order to justify a book title that kind of matched other books of his, like The Rainmaker or The Partner. Here, every time the character is called The Broker it seems forced, like it's stuck in there to justify the title.<br /><br />The Broker begins the book in prison after pleading guilty when a complicated software-spy-international deal blows up. Years later, sick and 60 pounds lighter, he's pardoned, whisked to Italy and given a new identity. Why? Because the CIA wants to leak his whereabouts to his enemies, of which there are many, to see who tries to kill him, so they can nab the killers. He's in Italy, and he's bait.<br /><br />The book is well-enough written, and just interesting enough to want to read through. However, it suffers from a way-too linear plot that more or less follows every footstep the Broker takes. Now he's having breakfast pastries! Now he's having a long lunch! Now he's learning Italian! Now it's time for dinner!<br /><br />There are several characters who are so undeveloped that it's obvious they were written in as plot devices only. A president so dumb he doesn't read anything at all? A son who apparently exists only to get his dad a cellphone and explain email? A dying husband in a rear bedroom who happens to have an available passport? Pull-ease. I kept thinking this last example would be a trap, but the plot was far too simple for anything like that. I was running rings around this book logically, and it was tiring.<br /><br />The book is interesting on a high level. Government corruption is always a fun thing to read about, and the descriptions of historical Bologna and Italian style all very nice. But it was a book written by someone resting on his laurels.ting on his laurels.
B000002JS6|1.0|One star is being generous.  This band's gimmick is loudness.  Not musical skill (as in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, ELO, Eric Clapton, or King Crimson), not well-written lyrics (as in John Lennon, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, David Bowie, Don Henley, or Lou Reed), not a great voice (like Joan Baez, Cass Elliott, or Janis Joplin), not blue-collar appeal (as in some of the better country acts), but nose-picking, butt-scratching, play-to-the-lowest-denominator grossness.  I bought this album a long time ago and after listening to it once, I put it away and didn't listen to it again for a number of years.  The next time I listened to it, I wondered why I bought it.  The lead singer's voice is distinctive, this is  true. But not in a way that makes me want to listen to it.  Their song lyrics are mediocre at best, and always seem to revolve around sex, or the pursuit of same.  Even songs about sex get old after a while. <br /> <br />This band just doesn't make it.  I know that might make its fans feel slighted that I didn't credit ACDC with inventing rock & roll, but I can't even credit them with PLAYING rock & roll. If you want metal, there are other options: Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and even (shudder) any number of blond-haired, blue-eyed, high tenor lead vocal groups (Poison, Whitesnake, Queensryche, etc.).  But ACDC just doesn't make it for me on ANY level.  Sorry, nothing personal to their fans, but wasting my money on one of their albums was enough of a mistake.
B0000009RX|5.0|Don't believe any of the lukewarm/negative responses-- this is the real deal. FZ and the Mothers combine humor/satire/social commentary/musicianship/observation/studio effects/etc. into a devastatingly effective aural tapestry that will floor you. The guy was a genius. You can play this a thousand times and hear something new with each spin. Freakin' unbelievable. Every track is gold. Buy it.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|It's no surprise that this album is terrific because all of Mariah's albums are (maybe with the exception of \\"Glitter\\"). \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is more R&B/Hip-Hop than most of her albums, like \\"Charmbracelet\\" was. A lot of the songs almost have a 70's R&B type of vibe. Her voice sounds fabulous on this CD. She's not as breathy as she was on \\"Charmbracelet\\". My favorite songs on the album are \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Stay The Night\\". This CD is excellent. There's not one song that's a dud. I highly recommend it.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is a farce but it is like the clowns in Shakespeare's plays. Kubrick uses comedy to draw our attention to the ridiculous. He is making us laugh and cringe but that's because we know this is no laughing matter. Just look at the world we're living in. If you don't think all these Code Orange alerts and Rummy's games aren't farcical, you haven't been paying attention.  <br /> <br />This film has some of the greatest comic acting of all time. George C. Scott was seriously pissed at Kubrick for making his performance go so over the top but because of that, we're treated to a brilliant send up of our military at work.  And Peter Sellars is beyond brilliant. If you haven't seen this movie you absolutely must.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is great! It's my favorite of its kind. The Big Lebowski is the best and most hilarious comedy that John Goodman, Jeff Bridges,and John Turturro have ever been in. This movie is The Coen brother's masterpiece with a creative and unique plot. There are movies with detective, cops, spies, tough guys and heroes doing what they do best...and then there's this movie with a real life loser doing what he never ment to do just to get out of what he never ment to get into along with a crazy bunch of characters that make one of the weirdest must see movies.
078401213X|5.0|Maybe it's because I can relate to this character's flight in and out of madness or maybe it's because this is just an amazing film but either way, it is definitely number one on my top 10 list.  <br /> <br />The movie mixes themes of paranoia, genius, mathematics, higher power, mania and mysticism. What other movies really do that? All with a unique style and brilliant vision.  <br /> <br />Aronofsky didn't ever do it again as far as I'm concerned. I hated Requiem For A Dream. I guess it''s because I could care less about a bunch of pretty drug addicts and a whacked middle-aged woman who was surrounded by annoying music.  <br /> <br />It doesn't matter because Pi is a masterpiece and very few people make even one of those per lifetime.
B000005JA8|5.0|The first sung words of the record say it all: \\"My smile is stuck,/ I cannot go back to your Frownland.\\"  This is one of the richest, most nourishing pieces of American music ever made.  In a way, its closest spiritual analogues are not other pieces of music, but ancient poetry: I think of it as an American answer to Han-Shan (Cold Mountain), the great cycle of Zen-Buddhist nature-poems from medieval China; or \\"Sweeney Astray\\" (Suibhne Bhuile), the great mystical-religious nature poem from ancient Ireland.  But that's just me.      In the end, though, this is an essential distillation of American musical styles: everything from Stephen Foster and campfire-ballads to Ornette Coleman and avant-garde jazz.  All of musical America is present and accounted for here (though magically transformed), on this one little record.  Plus, it's very funny... which only makes it all the more American.  And \\"Veteran's Day Poppy,\\" sad to say, is still relevant, and still heartbreaking, to a new generation of war-bereaved Americans...      Some people don't understand this record.  But then again, some people don't understand Jackson Pollock, John Coltrane, Walt Whitman, and the U.S. Constitution...
B0002858YS|5.0|This is a really good album by a great sounding band. <br /> <br />It starts off with a tremendous bang with the first four songs before settling into its paces for the remainder. <br /> <br />The first four songs are definiteley worth the price of purchase.  That's not to take away from the others, but these first four will really get your blood pumpin'. <br /> <br />Looking forward to more to come from these guys.
B00005JNRB|4.0|The movie was a well paced.Plenty of action and the ending was very good.With better high tech, this film had many similar scenes to Indiana Jones,so the film was not as creative as IJ.If a sequel is to be done I would suggest a better scirpt for leading lady or a different woman.I would recommend for action fans to see this movie.
1573223085|5.0|I'm a graduating senior at the University of Michigan. A Whole New Mind articulates everything I believe in deep down inside about how careers and our society is changing. Pink argues, quite convincingly, that the abundance, automation, and outsourcing prevalent in the information age are paving the way for a new era dominated by individuals who also possess right-brain abilities. <br /> <br />Artists, writers, designers, storytellers, pattern recognizers, big-picture seers. These kinds of individuals will be the new leaders of society. This transition into the Conceptual Age is causing shifts across all professions, even law and medicine. Pink highlights six aptitudes that are essential for the new era: Design, Symphony, Empathy, Story, Play, and Meaning. <br /> <br />I'm stopping here because you really need to read this book. They should give a copy of it to every graduating senior and every incoming freshman. But it doesn't matter who you are or how old you are. Ask yourself this: if someone overseas can do your job cheaper or if a computer can do it faster and more accurately, then how can you possibly make a difference in the world?
B000003TA4|5.0|Opinons people! to all people who hate grunge and blame nirvana on musical trends that have come along in last 10 years are idiots. It is the music industry is promoting them not Nirvana, Pearl jam or any grunge band. There are plenty of talent today but it is underground on indie labels not on mainstream making music suck today. Anyways, this album is great and landmark album much like Led Zepplein IV (hope i spell it write), Acdc's black in black. With songs like Smells like Teen Spirit, Come as yOu are, and lithium. My personal favourites here are Drain you, Territorial Pissings, and Polly. Check out Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, AIC (other great seattle bands) from this era as well.
B0006399FS|5.0|For all you crybabys who expect too much out of an artist these days, here's some advice, \\"get a life.\\"  I've listened to U2 for over 20 years and enjoy them for what they are, a great band with great songs that mean something. It's that simple.  Don't bore me with your 10 page review of every song this band ever produced.  This is \\"band,\\"  it's not your spouse, your kids or any one you are close to, so why act like it's life or death if their latest album doesn't help you fulfill some personal flaw you have.  Just listen to the great tunes and enjoy..it's that simple.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I haven't ever had much interest in writing music reviews, but lately I've been hearing so much good music, that I feel I have to share my thoughts. The Arcade Fire is no exception. This band is melodic, original, artistic, unique, dramatic, emotional, and amazing, and don't let some pretentious indie music snob tell you otherwise just because they're getting popular.  <br /> <br />\\"Funeral\\" is The Arcade Fire's debut album, however there was an EP released before this that you could only find at their concerts or through a Canadian music store named Cheap Thrills (a recent search there yielded no results, so I'm assuming they sold out of the 500 limited copies they had).  <br /> <br />The EP was nice, but this album is definitely where the band shines, if that's really the right word to describe what they do. They manage to make music that is dark in theme, but somehow uplifting at the same time. This is direct contrast to the band I find myself comparing them to as I listen to the album: The Polyphonic Spree. Win, the lead singer, has a voice somewhat similar, sometimes strikingly similar, to Tim Delaughter's (Tripping Daisy, Polyphonic Spree) voice. The Polyphonic Spree is a 25 member band whose members are decked out in multicolored robes, like a crazy rainbow church choir, but form a small orchestra and choir section. They sing happy, uplifting songs about life and love, dance around on stage, play amazing crescendos and just generally have a feel-good attitude, maybe at the expense of the quality of the lyrics. If The Polyphonic Spree is the print, The Arcade Fire is the negative film strip. They manage to capture the opposite emotion the Spree conveys with dark lyrics, (that seem to have more meaning behind them than Delaughter's) but music that makes you feel that maybe everything will be all right anyway.  <br /> <br />It all starts off with \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\". Beautiful and minimal piano, fuzzy guitars, loud organ, quiet strings, driving drums, Win's wailing and trembling voice, and the first taste of what's to come. An excellent start to an album that has momentum and leaves your curious. If you bought this album, just heard this track and had to leave without hearing the rest of the album, you'd anticipate coming back home all day.  <br /> <br />\\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" marks the introduction of sweeping strings on the list. Win and his wife, Regine, sing \\"Our mother shoulda just named you Laika! It's for your own good, it's for the neighborhood!\\". As they sing the word \\"neighborhood\\" in a Middle-Eastern or Indian style rising and falling sway of pitch, the strings match and complement their voices perfectly. Great song. <br /> <br />\\"Une Anne Sans Lumires\\" is oddly put between the \\"Neighborhood\\" tracks, but fits fine there anyway. One of many songs that lights up near the end with a quick burst of power, then quickly fades. <br /> <br />In the fourth track, \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\", you've got this hard distorted goth-rock guitar sound, but its mixed with a cheery xylaphone beat. How does that work? I don't know, but it does. <br /> <br />Then you've got \\"Neighborhood #4\\", the perfect song for the middle of an album. It has a nice, quiet, relaxed, but sad sound to it, that starts to build up but doesn't completely, leaving you room for the next track, \\"Crown of Love\\".  <br /> <br />This ballad is a dramatic theme that builds up what you missed in the previous track. You think its about to end as Win sings \\"you gotta be the one, you gotta be the way, your name is the only word that I can say!\\" twice until it erupts into a repeating two chord blast of musical emotion. This is my absolute favorite song on the album, but my only complaint with it is that like some of the other crescendos, it ends too quickly and ends with a fade, which I hate. Fades usually feel like a cop-out because it seems like they just couldn't find a good way to end the song. That might not be the case, maybe they thought it would sound better as a fade, but in my opinion, nine out of ten times, fades stink. On an upside to this, it sounds like they'd really jam it out live. <br /> <br />\\"Wake Up\\" is one of the songs that really shows what I was talking about when I was comparing them to Polyphonic Spree. You've got the choir sound during the chorus, but its sad and somehow hopeful simultaneously. It retains its dark sound all the way to the end, even through the last minute or so, which has a rockabilly bass line and a xylaphone beat that reminds me of the Sesame Street theme. And that's not a bad thing, it fits beautifully. <br /> <br />The only track I found to be weak was \\"Haiti\\". Regine sings on this song. First off, Regine sounds like she could be Bjork's twin sister. Which is good because Bjork is a great singer with a very unique voice, but at the same time, because she does, the comparison is probably going to haunt Regine throughout her musical career. Besides this fact, which I can overlook, is that the song is very droney, never goes anywhere, and is just not all that interesting to listen to. Its the only track on the album I skip. <br /> <br />\\"In Rebellion (Lies)\\", the droney sound comes back, but done correctly, this time with a gradual build-up of instruments that makes it much more listenable, especially when it changes key during the chorus to, seemingly, the perfect notes. <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"In the Back Seat\\", another song sung by Regine. This song is about 10,000 times better than Haiti and hits the crescendo pretty early on in the song, which is around six and a half minutes long and keeps it going strong. Regine is an amazing singer, and really shows it off here, whether she sounds like Bjork or not. One of the things I always look for when I decide how much I like an album is the track arrangement. This album hits the nail on the head and ends with the perfect track that winds down all the instruments, leaving only a string plucked string progressionto fade away into the black of the end of the album. Its very fitting for an album entitled \\"Funeral\\".  <br /> <br />Besides the Spree, I can hear influences of David Bowie, old U2, Roy Orbison, and The Cure. It never feels like they're trying to rip these bands off, but feels more like they've built upon groundwork these artists have set. <br /> <br />I'd give the album five stars if \\"Haiti\\" had been replaced with a better, more fitting song, and honestly I'd give this album four and half stars if I could. Its almost perfect. <br /> <br />-justin

B0006SSOHM|3.0|The movie did have a few good scenes, yet I found the ending unsatisfying and even disappointing and also, there are some obvious inconsistencies in the story line.
B0000027RL|5.0|Absolutely essential.  An all-time classic.  This album was always superior to Nevermind, in spite of the absurd mythology relentlessly spewed to this day by rock critics and VH1 Rockumentaries about Kurt Cobain.  As for PJ albums, I love them all, but this one was never topped.  \\"Why Go\\" and \\"Deep\\" are the only songs which aren't downright superb on Ten.  \\"Oceans,\\" \\"Porch,\\" and \\"Release\\" are the gems on Ten, in addition to the ones that still get airplay.  Easily one of the 10 best albums of the 1990's.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Her best work in years, every song as a great meaning and sound.
B000641Z90|4.0|Simply put, this is a great concert DVD.  The concert itself is great in terms of lighting, sound and song selection.  Most Phil Collins fans can probably name a few omitted songs they would like to have seen included, but overall the song choices are an excellent overview of Collins' solo career.  The extras alone are worth the purchase price of the collection.  The bonus features include a decent, if incomplete, collection of Collin's videos, some live footage of previous performances, a network special to promote the \\"But Seriously\\" album, and an amusing sketch in which Collins introduces the \\"behind the scenes\\" staff of the concert tour (it's neat that Collins goes to this length to salute these staffers).  These extras sold me on a concert video I wasn't sure about purchasing. All in all, this concert video is a great value that will appeal to even casual fans of Phil Collins' solo work. <br />  One technical note, in reply to another reviewer - the pause feature doesn't work on my DVD player either (I also have a Sony player), and unless I'm missing something, neither do the \\"extra angles\\" featured on some of the songs. And like that reviewer, this is the first time I've encountered this.  A relatively minor incovenience - just thought I'd reply to the earlier comments.
0385510454|1.0|I swore I would never read another Grisham book again after The Chamber, but, I gave in and read The Broker. It took about 150 pages to deal with the main characters very boring escapades in Italy, and just when it finally picked up it ended, with the worst ending I have ever experienced. The best way to expain it is that \\"It Just Ended.\\" And it left the reader hanging. Trust me this is the last Grisham book I will ever read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|During the mid nineties I found myself being drawn to the U.S rap scene, intrigued by the beats and lyrical skills of M.Cs such as Nas, Jay-z, Notorious B.I.G and 2pac,leaving the British band scene of which my culture is most suited to behind. I admit I became one of those middle class white youths obessed with the rap culture and began dressing accordingly, but even more embrassingly due to the fact im a white british youth(theres nothing more embrassing than a white british youth wanting/trying to be a black American gangsta rapper). This trend continued alongside my appeal of british bands such as Oasis, The Verve and Blur etc. During that time Radiohead released O.K Computer, which i brought on the strength of he guitar rift on Paranoid Android but by then the rot of rap had set in. Now thats not to descredit rap music in fact far from it. Albums including Illmatic, Ready To Die, It Takes A Nation Of Millions and All Eyez On Me are for me some of the best albums to ever be produced and Ive followed the likes Of Nas and Jay-Z since their debuts to this day, but i flatly ignored O.K Computer and it remained on my shelf collecting dust. But by 2001 I had become increasingly bored of the rap scene and the lack invention of either rappers and producers on the whole,(with execption to eminem and Dr Dre)and i decided to take a look at my collection and play some what my parents would call 'proper' music. The First record i played was O.K Computer and could not believe with what i had been missing out on for the past 5 years. The Passion, angst and rhythm within the lyrics and instruments whisked my back to the days of Oasis's Definitely Maybe or how i felt when i first heard Wonderwall from Whats The Story and realised my failings towards the music produced from Britain.The atmosphere created by O.K Computer engulfed me in my room and i sat there for a whole afternoon listening to each tune 3 times over each enjoying each chord and drum. From then on i decided to findout what was happening on the British band scene/ guitar music in general and i havent looked back since and im extremely glad!. The U.S rap scene has been in decline for several years, not in sales in fact it has got even bigger but the quality has dropped considerable. I mean the likes of 50 Cent, Ja Rule and other crap like that would not have stood i chance in the mid to late nineties, the whole genre has sold out massively with the last worthy rap albums of the last 8 years being Eminem's First 2 albums, Dr Dres 2001 and Kanye West's college dropout, i challenge anyone to name me a better album then them, impossible!. This has has come in tandem with the rise of good quality bands over the last 5 years, including Coldplay, The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand and others of the same ilke. Thank you radiohead for saving me money and sanity!.
B000000OSE|5.0|Better than Appetite or Illusion II.  Basically, more daring than Appetite, and more solid than Illusion II.  \\"Right Next Door to Hell,\\"  \\"Perfect Crime,\\" and \\"Garden of Eden,\\" are true to GnR form.  \\"Dust n Bones,\\" \\"Bad Obsession,\\" and \\"You ain't the First\\" show different sides of GnR.  \\"Double-talkin' Jive,\\" written by Izzy Stradlin, is brilliant.  \\"November Rain\\" and \\"The Garden\\" (w/ Alice Cooper) are the classics.  \\"Bad Apples\\" is a bit of a 70's throwback, a bit like Mott the Hoople or the Faces.  The Illusion albums are musings of a band on an emotional rollercoaster, to say the least.  The same turmoil and tension that ripped this great band apart in a matter of a few years also happened to spawn many amazing songs which separated Guns n Roses from any band or musical category of its time.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Following a potent hero's journey template, Boys Don't Cry packs a vast and profound message about American society.  It feels especially pertinent in an age of red-state vs. blue state cultural diviseness.  First-time director, Kimberly Peirce, a real artist, avoids such alienating and inaccurate generalities, and grounds her progressive values of equality and opportunity in the psyches and motivations of her characters.  Beginning in a roller-rink fantasia, the film immediately draws one into Brandon Teena's (the deservedly accoladed Hilary Swank) enthusiastic and unattainable dream.  As the plot develops, Peirce expertly balances the ominous and the exciting, pitting Brandon's relationship with Lana (a dynamite Chloe Sevigny) against Lana's violent ex-boyfriend, John (an eerie and charismatic Peter Sarsgaard).  The engrossing drama exists within the socio-political mileu of rural disadvantage, ignorance, and substance abuse (how many scenes convey characters drinking alcohol?) enabling the viewer to reap a multi-faceted and rewarded viewing experience.  Highly recommended.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer has everything u want in a movie, u have the a-list cast, u have a theme song by Damien Rice to die for, and it just keeps you wanting more.  I love absolutely everything about this film, the way its shot, the dialogue... ohh this is one of the best screenplays of the year.  The movie is soo honest, and it will likely change ur life, and the way you talk.  Like Gwen Stefani says, &quot;What are you WAITING FOR~~~~&quot;, get this movie RIGHT NOW!
0800141865|4.0|\\"The People vs. Larry Flynt\\" clearly has two parts, because before we get around to debating the First Amendment in front of the United States Supreme Court there is the rags to riches story of how a kid selling moonshine back in the hills of Kentucky ended up creating the \\"Hustler\\" empire.  Basically this is the story of how Flynt (Woody Harrelson) took the example of \\"Playboy\\" to the next level (\\"next\\" being a sequential idea that does not automatically imply transcendence).  Flynt was just trying to figure out a way of getting people to come to his Cincinnati club to ogle his dancers and drink his booze, but when he pays money for nude photographs of Jackie-O and puts them in \\"Hustler\\" magazine he is suddenly selling two million copies.<br /><br />Flynt's publishing philosophy is rather simple.  Give the public what it wants and what it wants in this sort of magazines are articles and other content consistent with the dirty pictures because guys do not buy skin magazines to learn how to hook up their stereos (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).  Hugh Hefner might seek such a veneer to provide a sense of propriety for \\"Playboy,\\" but Flynt is happy to wallow in the reality of pornography.  Emphasizing the crotch shot made \\"Hustler\\" stand out from the competition and the content ended up as raunchy as the pictures.  Each in turn would bring Flynt to trial and make him a poster boy for the First Amendment.  It is this battle that justifies the title of the film and makes up the second half of the story.<br /><br />This 1996 film is also divided between the messenger and the message.  Harrelson was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as the flamboyant and foul-mouthed Flynt.  If there is a running gag in this film it is the vain attempts by Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) to reign in his client in court.  But there actually is a method to Flynt's madness because the first time he is hauled into court (the real Flynt plays the judge and James Carville is the prosecutor) he learns that justice does not have to be fair.  If \\"Hustler\\" is obscene then \\"Playboy\\" and \\"Penthouse\\" should be obscene too, and visa versa, but that logic escapes the jury in Cincinnati and it takes an appeals court to reaffirm that the First Amendment by definition covers offensive speech even when it comes in the forms of photographs of naked women with their legs spread.<br /><br />The last act of the film is given over to the message, and it seems almost fitting that when the big moment comes it is Issacman, who has been injured as well as insulted as Flynn's lawyer (he was wounded in the same hail of gunfire that left Flynn a paraplegic), who gets to stand up before the Supreme Court and explain why it is okay to publish a rauchy parody of a liquor ad that suggests the Reverend Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse.  It is easy to reduce the morale of the film down to Flynt's simple declaration that \\"If they'll protect a scumbag like me, then they'll protect all of you,\\" but it is Issacman's oral arguments to the court and his exchanges with Justices Stevens and Scalia in particular, taken from the actual transcripts, that lay out the whys and wherefores that should make there way into reasoned arguments on the topic.  When we get to the core issues that are being affirmed by this film, Flynt is sitting in the aisle peeling an orange.<br /><br />Director Milos Forman's film makes it clear that those on the other side do not know that they are wrong: Issacman does not even have to try hard to get Falwell to admit on the witness stand that the \\"Hustler\\" parody is so outrageous no reasonable person would believe it, thereby destroying the libel claim.  The man behind the first case in Cincinnati is Charles Keating (James Cromwell), whose name is now irrevocably linked with the Savings & Loan bailout scandal, so that those casting the stones are doing so with unclean hands of a different type.  Butin the end you can take clearly take the message without the messenger because it would be reasonable for some to consider Flynt neither a martyr nor a hero (certain the dark side of his life is brought clearly into the light).  The problem is that when Flynt asks why he has to go to jail to protect our civil rights it is a legitimate question.take the message without the messenger because it would be reasonable for some to consider Flynt neither a martyr nor a hero (certain the dark side of his life is brought clearly into the light).

0064407667|3.0|Reading the back of the book and other reviews, I was a little skeptical.  Why would I, let alone a child, want to read such a depressing story?  But it is popular so I figured I'd give it a shot.   <br /> <br />I was definitely pulled in by the writing.  I loved the definitions provided in the text by Mr. Snicket.  The writing moved the story along but allowed me to stop and think without losing momentum.   <br /> <br />The story worried me a little - what message are we sending to children?  These kids were on their own with no reasonable adult paying attention to their dire situation.  But, I felt better by the end.  The story strongly demonstrated values such as responsibility to your family and resourcefulness in solving your problems.   <br /> <br />Overall, I thought it was a very well written book that would get children thinking and entertain them.  I'm still not sure about the content matter.  I'm hoping the subsequent books will win me over completely.
0783226837|5.0|In homage to 1950's giant bug movies Tremors is about giant mutant worms that suck up people under the ground.  The greatest thing about this film is the outlandish characters and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is definately more of horror movie than the sequels, but there are some very good comedy bits instead of just having a straight up comic relief character.  The special effects are genuin, no CG crap, or mat paintings.  The acting is funny, Michael Gross is more of an (...) in this movie than a hero like he is in the others, but I still like him better than the two leads.  Worth every penny, one of my favorite movies.
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you want to know about the plot, read the other reviews.  If you want to know the effect on a guy who never watched Animes before, read on.  Today I'm an Anime fan! This is important, as I wasn't.  No way could you to get me to believe in Animes. Then I watched Princess Mononoke!  It was over after that. I could not believe the style, sound, color, dub, and, most importantly for Animes, the plot.  Everyone I show it to loves it.  Even when I was watching it on my PC on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam, the Stewardes and passengers stopped to ask what it was.  Princess Mononoke is the highest standard in movie length Anime, even better than the excellent Oscar winning \\"Spirited Away\\" by the same director.  If you want to find out if you like anime get this movie.  Then, if you do, go on to the other anime series I found to be wonderful, such as \\"Trigun\\" \\"Tenchi\\" \\"Full Medal Panic\\" and \\"GXP.\\"  Find your own and become a fan.  It's so easy.<br /><br />Smiles
0790731894|5.0|I've seen this before, but it was just on tv, and it's actually a pretty good action/thriller. Definately not one of those YEAH RIGHT THAT IS SO FAKE movies, indicating they concocted everything with precision and knowledge. You enjoy it from beginning to end with it's non stop action and intense scenes between the american soldiers and the terrorists. Kurt Russell proves once again to be a hands on actor and a worthy main character. There is another similar movie but not as good as executive decision. It's called passenger 57. In the past I always confused the two. But if you enjoyed this one, try passenger 57 out. It's with Wesley Snipes.
B0002X314C|4.0|What can I say about this CD except \\"Buy It!...It's good!\\" <br />By now the lead single \\"Ordinary People\\" has become an anthem! <br />John Legend conjures up notions of the days of Wonder, Hathaway, <br />Flack, and a handful of other greats from R&B days gone by <br />who changed the whole pallet of the musical genre itself! <br />This kat is definitely one to watch!!
B00006DEFA|5.0|I enjoyed the Director's cut if only for the chance to see more Salieri and the director, producer, writer, and  main actor's interviewed-years after the fact it is clear to see this fantasia about a  legendary genius's music and the jealous rage of his alleged 'killer' Salieri was a labor of love.  <br /> <br />In the interviews it's great fun to hear the cold war tales of secret police (half the Czech crew it seems lol) bugged rooms (F. Murray's story is particularly hilarious).
B0007GAERG|1.0|I had always been a big fan of Mariah and I love all her albums up to Rainbow but everything pretty much went downhill from there.  Since leaving Sony, Mariah tries hard to change her image and become a R&B singer with disasterous results. This album ,which has been hailed as \\"The Return of the Voice\\" is a complete dissapointment. The first single and also first song on the album is not that bad but it would have been even better if someone else like Ashanti or Beyonce had sung it. Mariahs voice doesn't fit. Her voice....another problem. There is no denying it now : She has lost it. On the album, for example in the song \\"Mine Again\\",  it screetches and warbles in ways that it almost painful. Mariah do us all a favour: Stop singing and start a family or do something else in your life. Your time as a star is officially over.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Really I'd give this DVD 4.5 stars, but I'm in an optomistic mood so I rounded it off to 5. Some of the videos on this disc are almost as interesting as the music. Probably my favourite GN'R song is \\"Estranged\\", and the elaborate video makes for a very enjoyable musical and visual experience. The only disappointing thing about this DVD is the lack of any extras whatsoever! In addition to this (or is \\"addition\\" an oxymoron in this case? Should I put the thesaurus away?) the video for \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is absent. Apart from this fairly minor criticism, Welcome to the Videos rocks.

This is a wonderful book.
B0000028W9|4.0|Other than his collections, this is my favorite Leonard Cohen album. The music is simple yet complex, the mood is sometimes dismal, sometimes sexy, the lyrics are poetry, and the voice is smooth and hypnotic. The songs \\"The Future\\" and \\"Waiting For The Miracle\\" are rivaled in greatness only by \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"Anthem\\". Those songs are all amazing even if in different ways. I feel the last three songs don't quite hold up, but they're still good. \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"Various Positions\\" are excellent albums too, but I \\"Always\\" look forward to \\"The Future\\".
0800141601|2.0|The casting of Connery as an old Arthur was not bad.  He was at least effective in the role the script provided him. Julia Ormand was a wonderful Guenivere. And Cross as Maliagaunt was especially great as the villain. I consider him to have stolen the movie outright from the others. I thought Gere was not the right pick for Lancelot, and further, it seemed he merely gave a pay-the-rent type performance.<br />The movie does get points at least for using as inspiration a source other than Sir Thomas, for a change, in favour of one of Chretien de Troye's tales.  The whole of the Maliagaunt kidnaps Guenivere plot was right out of Chretien. It is not without some irony that where it is closest to Chretien, it is best. It does take things in different directions with different characters which seems more whim than artistic decision.  The other Arthurian characters are either minimized, or not utilized at all. Maliagaunt is used most effectively, Arthur and Guenivere work fairly well, while Lancelot is just too card-board tragic as scripted.  Those are the only characters that get the film time, really. <br />One of the oddest things about the movie was that they sent Arthur off in a pyre, burned up like a viking!  No way the king will &quot;return&quot; after that, thereby killing the nationalistic resonance of the legend. <br />The visual look of the film is more of a pristine sort of, fantasy look. It isn't very gritty at all, with all the bright costumes, and bright architecture. There seems nothing dirty in the realm. And apparently, in some cases they didn't use real swords, that is, real prop swords even. If one pays attention there is a moment in the climactic battle where Lancelot is holding a sword, then merely a hilt, then his sword reappears again!<br />This film as far as I know is the only English language film that seems to have taken any inspiration from Chretien (there is a much better adapted French language one, script-wise). It is fairly acceptable forfamily viewing, (something which, generally, can not be said about EXCALIBUR) the good are fairly good, and the bad are really bad. <br />Judging from younger relatives, if they can sit through and enjoy Harry Potter, this might not be a bad introduction at least to other realms of fantasy.

B000002KET|5.0|Last weekend my borther and I went to a record store to do some shopping, and we found this CD set that featured BLACK SABBATH'S Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage together on one disc for $19.99; the catch was that it was a rare promotional \\"test mix\\" of these albums, so each one is missing a song or two(this album is missing Fluff) and the quality is very rough. Still I find that it was certainly worth the price of admission, as both albums rock, especially this one. The creativity is at perhaps a high for SABBATH, and I'll argue that this album features hands-down the best guitar work of any SABBATH album. Iommi is that good here. The riffs range from dark and oddly melancholic at times to the classic bluesy rock that we have known to love from the boys in black, to some incredible acoustic and softer stuff. The solos shred so much here, and on some songs there are cool guitar effects used to enhance the sound which really work well. Fantastic work. Geezer's bass rumbles here in tremendous fashion, never elenting from that mighty throb that is the pulse of SABBATH'S rythm section. Bill Ward's stellar drumming is put to great effect as usual; the man certainly doesn't get enough credit. While never over-powering, his style is just unique and perfect to their sound. On the other end of the musical spectrum we also get to hear use of piano and synths, which is really cool too. Finally onto the vocals; even though on this CD the vocals are muffled(being the test mix) when listening cloesly enough you can just hear how great he sounded. Lyrically this is another strong effort, continuing in grand SABBATH traditional of thought-provking lyrics. Every aspect of this album is excellent, and it continues the string of amazing 70's albums by SABBATH, whose streak of great records is topped only by the incomprable IRON MAIDEN. <br /> <br /> <br />1.) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath- This album starts off with a bang with the immense title track, and the opening riff just sets the tone in perfect fashion. Heavy and dark through the verses, it lightens up a bit for the stellar chorus. The solos here are right up with some of SABBATH'S finest work, and the lyrics are awesome too. Ozzy is in great form. A perfect way to start this masterpiece. <br /> <br />2.) A National Acrobat- Another magnificent piece, starting with a lazy/bluesy guitar riff before exploding into a heavy and melancholic verse section. This is a longer song that progresses nicely as it plugs along. One of my favorite's on the album, some tremendous lyrics again. Iommi shines throughout this one especially, and Geezer's bass perfectly complements it. <br /> <br />3.) Sabbra Caddabra- Starting with a more uptempo, bouncy riff this marks a change form the first two songs which adds to the album's depth. Very fun song, showcasing Ward's tremdnous ability at using the hi-hat to his advantage. About midway through there's is some excellent keyboard and piano use when the song slows a bit. Another fantastic song. <br /> <br />4.) Killing Yourself To Live-  My favorite song on the album, this one starts with a riff that could only be written by Iommi, just a heavy rocking one that will get stuck in your head. Following it is one of the more interetsing aspects of the song; the guitars have that \\"under water\\" feeling to them(think MAIDEN'S Strange World) which I just love and is continued through the verses. The chorus is extremely strong again, and the lead work here is nothing short of impressive. Just an outstanding tune that keeps the album rolling along in style   <br /> <br />5.) Who Are You- This song is marked by a very unique and interetsing ambience that starts off the song and continues throughout, giving it a kinda \\"spacey\\" feel. Really, really cool and Ozzy's vocals fit perfectly. The middle section of this song is breathtaking as well, more great use of piano and synths to create a great atmosphere. Overall a welcomed change of pace that keeps the record sounding fresh, the mark of a truly magnificent album. <br /> <br />6.) Looking For Today- A more classic sounding SABBATH tune than its precedor, the riff in htis song is a little reminiscent of Supernaut. The chorus, however, is actually one of the best parts of the album. Gliding acoustics and some cool flute thingy or something really makes the song stand out. <br /> <br />7.) Spiral Architect- Finally, the album concludes strongly with this beautiful composition. Starting with a sooting acoustic intro before building up, the riffing here is really solid, and it boasts an awesome chorus to boot. Really love the feeling here, and Ozzy sounds almost triumphant here. Perfect way to close the album. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, this album is just pure SABBATH mixed some very new elements that set this album apart. Just a fantastic record that must be in your collection.
B00000I07Q|3.0|Overall a good album. I remember riding my bike to the record store to get this mostly because a girl I liked had it. Anyway, though not as strong as the previous album, \\"New Jersey\\" still has some gems. I always break this album into thirds in my head. The first third is the strongest, with the 3 big rockers plus \\"Living In Sin\\". The second third to me is just blah, not bad, but not good, and the last 4 tracks are a good combo of rockers and ballads too. In short I'd say a must for the real fan, but otherwise \\"Slippery When Wet\\" or the \\"Cross Road\\" collection should be enough for casual fans.
B0000AFX64|1.0|Previous reviewers have said most of what is great about this DVD and the series in general. The Battlestar Galactica film, and the pilot version, were great for their day, at turns dark, and bright. And honestly about half the television episodes were just as great as well, with intermittent episodes of fair to mediocre quality.<br />SO IF I LIKE THIS SO MUCH... Why the one star only? The sound! In this day and age to buy a DVD, even from the late 70's / early 80s, that is in such a price range, and it only has 1.0 sound. That is simply not acceptable at all. Essentially one is getting a DVD with only VHS sound quality, and then the price you pay is supposedly justified only by the widescreen picture format.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I don't know what album some of these reviewers are listening to, obviously not the same one I am. Maybe a few have slipped into a crack-induced coma because the voice isn't \\"gone,\\" the voice is back!!! And Mariah Carey doesn't need to \\"imitate\\" Beyonce. That's just laughable. People please!!! I know you're pissed off because she's still can sing, but try and get a life. You better get out your box of Kleenex because the voice is SENSATIONAL. Just cry at how beautiful it is while you listen to the album. Perhaps if you're looking for a \\"dog's whistle,\\" you should head to a pet store. Because the only thing on this album is GREAT singing. If you don't like Mariah, then fine. Just go crawl into a hole somewhere so we don't have to hear about your nonsense. If the majority of the 1-star reviewers had half the talent that Mariah does, they wouldn't have time to share their stupidity. Get \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" You'll LOVE it!!!
0312979479|5.0|One of the best by agatha christie. I really enjoyed the ending of the story. it starts off as a little gathering on an island but suddnely people are being murder left and right but know one knows who the murder is, because it seem like every one is dieing do you know how the murder is . But my personal opinion is that police should not do the crime.
B000002AP1|3.0|I have quite a few problems with Raw Power. Plenty of people will tell you that it's a classic and obviously the best Stooges release, but methinks those folks haven't heard the first two (self-titled, Fun House). Moreover, it's not really a Stooges album, per se.<br /><br />Before you slap me for committing an act of sacrilege, it should be noted that Raw Power was recorded with a different lineup over the original Detroit outfit, and 3 years after the awe-inspiring Fun House. The Asheton Brothers are here, but Ron has been regulated to bass, while previous bassist Dave Alexander is nowhere to be seen. That already threatens to rob The Stooges of much of their original charm, since it was Ron's fuzzed-out, wah-wah heavy, wiry 3-chord attack and Dave's thudding basslines that stole the show on the prior two albums (even over Iggy's wild stage act). Speaking of the Ig, he now gets top billing here over his bandmates. Hmmm..<br /><br />Anyway, the new guitarist (James Williamson) totally ruins the new sound. Whereas The Stooges of old was a dirty, primeival boogie machine, Williamson's more technical playing totally throws off the band's garage-rock aesthetic. Less is often more, and Asheton understood that to a T. Also problematic is Iggy, whose vocals no longer effortlessly channel the kind of grimy menace they used to; instead sounding over-the-top, nasal, and affected.<br /><br />Then there's the production. Don Gallucci's mixing job on Fun House was absolutely perfect, with equal amounts murky aggression and brilliant clarity. John Cale's rawer, bargain-basement job on the debut was rough but acceptable. However, neither mix of Raw Power (original Bowie mix and Iggy-supervised remaster) really captures the right sound. Bowie's sounds tepid, too quiet and muddled, but at least it had decent dynamics and was listenable. Iggy's mix sounds truly godawful--the result of cranking everything into the red, it's an undynamic (read: constantly LOUD with no peaks or valleys) sonic mess with overdistortion and digital clipping all over the place. It's just crap, one of the worst remasters I've ever heard.<br /><br />I could forgive some of these flaws if the songwriting was good. Guess what? It's generally underwhelming. Only Search And Destroy (which is the only classic track from this album), Penetration, and I Need Somebody really live up to The Stooges' prior reputation. Gimme Danger sounds like a Doors B-side to my ears, the title track is hamstrung by annoying piano, Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell doesn't live up to its incendiary title, and Death Trip feels overlong and ends in a boring fade-out, thus robbing the album of a powerful exit. Viewed as an Iggy solo album, it's better than most of his post-Lust For Life work, but that's not saying a whole lot.<br /><br />Pick up Fun House and the debut (along with The MC5's Kick Out The Jams and The Monks' Black Monk Time) and help yourselves to some awesome, historical garage-bred rock 'n' roll/proto-punk. Save this mediocre final chapter for last.r valleys) sonic mess with overdistortion and digital clipping all over the place. It's just crap, one of the worst remasters I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />I could forgive some of these flaws if the songwriting was good. Guess what? It's generally underwhelming.

Gimme Danger sounds like a Doors B-side to my ears, the title track is hamstrung by annoying piano, Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell doesn't live up to its incendiary title, and Death Trip feels overlong and ends in a boring fade-out, thus robbing the album of a powerful exit. Viewed as an Iggy solo album, it's better than most of his post-Lust For Life work, but that's not saying a whole lot.  <br /> <br />Pick up Fun House and the debut (along with The MC5's Kick Out The Jams and The Monks' Black Monk Time) and help yourselves to some awesome, historical garage-bred rock 'n' roll/proto-punk. Save this mediocre final chapter for last.
B000002LMK|5.0|With Neil Young's 1989 solo effort Freedom, I like many others was warming up to his music again, after the numerous and sometimes alienating stylistic changes he was making in the 1980's.   On Freedom, I tended to favor the harder cuts on the album such as \\"Don't Cry\\" \\"Rocking In The Free World\\" his driving cover of \\"On Broadway\\".   At the same time I was heavily listening to some of his work with Crazy Horse; Live Rust and Rust Never Sleeps.  All though this I was thinking, \\"Why doesn't he just make another kick-a**, all electric album from beginning to end?\\"  \\"And at the same time why not just get back together With Crazy Horse?\\"    Well less than a year later in 1990, both prayers were answered.  Neil Young finally reunited With Crazy horse for Ragged Glory.  And the music matched my expectations and anticipation.  I was totally blown away with their resulting effort. Raw, honest, intense and most importantly, excellent songs.  Truckloads of guitars and solos.   Short, terse rockers are mixed with their trademark eight to ten minute jams and loads of feedback in the right places.  Most importantly this album matches all of his 70's work, with and without Crazy Horse.      Ragged Glory is also the essential album to listen to on a long country drive, disturbing the cattle and the small towns on the way!  The leadoff track on the CD \\"Country Home\\" is obviously well-suited for the aforementioned type of drive.  \\"White Line\\" has an excellent driving riff and is a very concise song, almost ending prematurely, kind of like Stone Temple Pilots \\"Interstate Love Song\\" four years later.        \\"F*!#in' UP\\" is my favorite track on Ragged Glory.  It is the most aggressive song on the album lyrically and musically.  It's an understatement, but this song kicks serious a**.  The title itself prevented it from major airplay, but changing or editing that would be a grave injustice.  \\"Over And Over\\" has a killer melody, a great chorus and the guitars keep on rocking.     \\"Love toBurn\\" is a ten-minute long opus that seriously rocks. It will hold your attention the entire duration and at the same time may cause to you look deep inside yourself on what you want and need out of love and out of life.    The bouncy \\"Farmer John\\" snaps you out of that, I think of a comely, natural, well built county girl almost every time I listen to it. \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" is the track that garnered the most radio airplay at the time.  The second ten-minute opus is \\"Love And Only Love\\".    The only downer is \\"Mother Earth\\" I respect the message Neil is trying to make with this track, but it is completely subpar and totally out of place on the CD, unfortunately, it practically rescues the CD from near perfection.  It is a totally expendible track.    This album may have prepared me somewhat for 1991-92 grunge explosion.  I was beginning to gravitate towards rawer, grungier rock at the time, not to replace the more polished hard rock or progressive rock that I was listening to but to compliment it.  While Neil Young's \\"Godfather Of Grunge\\" title is obvious and a little overused now, Ragged Glory helped me welcome the sounds of Nirvana, Soundgarden & Pearl Jam with open arms.
0634060384|4.0|a great recreation of the original (illegal, \\"underground\\") Real Book.  the lead sheets have clear, bold notes, and the pages are never crowded.  the tunes are in alphabetical order, and all fit one to a page (or, in the case of longer ones, on facing pages).  essential riffs are written out (like in \\"Seven Steps to Heaven\\").   <br /> <br />good selection of standards, but for every commonly played tune they include, you could name two or three equally well-known tunes that are missing.  this is a pity, as you'd love to make this the only fake book you'll ever need.
B000002A3T|4.0|When The Division Bell was first released, the common response was: \\"Well, it's not The Dark Side of The Moon\\".   Well obviously it is not, but that does not mean that The Division Bell is not good, progressive rock music that falls below typical Floydian standards.    Put it this way, did the Beatles always put out something as good as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely hearts Club Band?   Did Led Zeppelin always creatively equate their untitled fourth album (aka Led Zeppelin IV or Zoso) ?  Does this mean that Let It Be or In Through The Out Door sucks?  No, it does not.  No artist has an entire catalogue completely containing five-star output.  But The Division Bell is still an adventurous, well constructed progressive rock album, that effectively employs the trademark Pink Floyd atmospherics and sound effects.    The most significant aspect of The Division Bell is that for the first time since Wish You Were Here that it is truly a collaborative effort between the Pink Floyd principals, David Gilmour on lead guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, and the full-time recording return of founding Floyd member Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals, who also contributes songwriting credits on five of the eleven tracks.  Of course all of this is a result of David Gilmour's perseverance of having the Floyd continue as well as the band not being under the thumb of former member and creative force of Roger Waters.      The album kicks off with a short atmospheric instrumental, \\"Cluster One\\". It then immediately segues in to the funky-electric-piano laden but guitar driven \\"What Do You want From Me\\".    \\"Poles Apart\\" is a pensive lament to the beyond deteriorated relationship of David Gilmour and Roger Waters.  \\"Marooned\\" is a dreamy, excellent instrumental with some of David Gilmour's finest guitar work of late.     The album does hit a bit of a musical stagnancy with \\"A Great day For Freedom\\", commenting on the 1989 falling of the Berlin Wall about five years too late.  But in all fairness, Pink Floyd's last album, 1987's  A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, was seven years prior to The Division Bell.    The stagnancy almost continues with the next track \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" but a very pleasant and significant thing happens, for the first time since 1973's \\"Us And Them\\" from The Dark Side of The Moon, Richard Wright reemerges for the first time in 21 years on lead vocals.  It is also to an extent his take on his relationship with Roger Waters.     The Division Bell finally regains its momentum on the remaining five tracks, which along with \\"What Do You want From Me\\" are the best cuts on The Division Bell.  \\"Take It Back\\" with the familiar Gilmour staccato riff, shifts the album back into musical gear.  The wailing sounds are actually from David Gilmour e-bowing an acoustical guitar.  The upbeat and anthemic \\"Coming Back To Life\\" keeps things going musically, I think the song is a metaphor for the reemergence of Pink Floyd as a truly collaborative, functional unit, back from their early to mid 80's oblivion.    \\"Keep Talking\\", a highly progressive track, and the lead FM rock radio track that spent many weeks at #1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.  It is a plea for humans to simply foster better communications and relationships with each other, as mentioned many times the synthesized voice on this song is provided by the famous cosmologist Dr. Stephen Hawking.  Dr. Hawking suffers from a motor-neurone disease and is confined to a wheelchair; he cannot speak with out the aid of his synthasized device.     \\"Lost For Words\\" an accessible melodic, acoustic laden tack, opens up the Gilmour vs. Waters motif again, with David Gilmour accounting the rejection of his olive branch attempt for reconciliation with Roger Waters, which the latter ultimately rejects.    \\"High Hopes\\" concludes this great work, an epic a longing for the days of youth and when things were simpler, whether is was child hood or the earlier days of Pink Floyd. Surprisingly in 1994 this track garnered a good amount of FM rock radio airplay; it was fifth track of the album released to rock radio.        Another note of signifcance about The Division Bell that this was Pink Floyd's first number one album in 14 years, since its classic The Wall.  It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart and remained there for four weeks.    Is The Division Bell on par with The Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here or The Wall? No absolutely not, but if you find Meddle, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason or any other true collaborative  Pink Floyd group effort to be really good music, then by all means do not pass on the The Division Bell.
B0000JCFPE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  The plot is intriguing, diabolical and multi-faceted, the characters are interesting, and the score is mesmerizing.  All in all this film is captivating and erotic. The unrated version is definitely worth getting over the R rated version. The review by Camille Paglia is worth watching all the way through because her insights on the film are quite interesting because she really explains the imagery and  the interplay between Douglas and Stone.  Paglia also brings up the role of Goddess religions and the occult as being part of the movie which explain and give depth to the Catherine Trammel character, and she also gives an interesting take on how the movie in some ways is very analagous to the war between the sexes and the role of the vamp character in explaining the feminine mystique.
B000031WD9|5.0|At a time when teen comedies are a largely hit or miss affair (\\"Mean Girls\\" was the only really good recent one), \\"American Pie\\" is perhaps the only film of this genre, along with its two sequels, that can remain consistantly hilarious with each viewing (along with \\"Old School\\" and \\"Road Trip\\").<br /><br />The first \\"American Pie\\" tells the story of a bunch of high schoolers and their sexual misadventures. At the heart of this hormone induced madness is Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), a curious young man who has a thing or two to learn about the birds and the bees. His easygoing and overbearing father (Eugene Levy, who steals the show) doesn't do much to help, nor do his friends Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Kevin (Eddie Kaye Thomas) or big jerk Stifler (Sean William Scott).<br /><br />Eventually, Jim learns a thing or two and ends up with band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).<br /><br />Buoyed by a witty script courtesy of Adam Herz and a strong supporting cast that includes Tara Ried, Mena Suvar and Natasha Lyonne, \\"American Pie\\" may well be remembered for spawning some of the funniest moments in comedy history. From the tongue tornado to Finch's bathroom break to the Nadia internet scene to the pale ale to the classic pie sex, it will be difficult to pick the best part since there are so many.<br /><br />My advice is that if you really want to enjoy a good laugh, you must go and pick up \\"American Pie\\" (and its sequels, but a little later on). You will not disappointed.
B0002858YS|5.0|While listening to this album, I began to feel like I was in the 80's. Not a bad thing. This band is definitely doing something different. This is punk that adults can listen to and reflect on their teenage years. (as if it was the 80's). Most punk and emo today is the type of music that 13 year olds would love. Not us older people. But this is actually good music made by a talented band that we can enjoy.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is the one of the few bands truly deserving of a two disc \\"best of\\" collection. From Stevie Nick's amazing songwriting prowess to the rest of band's craftsmenship in making their songs come alive, they are truly worthy of a career spanning anthology.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" contains all of the band's biggest songs that put them on the map back in the mid 1970s' and early '80s, including \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Rhiannon\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Sarah\\" \\"Hold Me\\", \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Little Lies\\". All of these songs have been digitally remastered for the finest sound possible in today's modern world.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" also contains the lion's share of classic album tracks and minor singles that rarely get any recognition, including \\"The Chain\\" (which was somehow absent from the previous single disc collection), \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"What Makes You Think You're The One\\", \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Everywhere\\" (one of my all time favorites), \\"As Long As You Follow\\" (very mellow, got me through a lot of long car rides as a kid) and \\"Paper Doll\\", to name a few. I really like some of the stuff that usually gets a lot of criticism from fans, such as \\"Family Man\\" (though the music for this one sounds like it cmae right out of \\"Donkey Kong) and \\"The Sky's The Limit\\".<br /><br />The producers made a wise decision by leaving off everything from the first five years when Peter Green was in the group and the incarnation without Byckingham or Nicks from the mid 1990s', when they released the horrid \\"Time\\" album. The only thing I wish they did with this collection is added solo hits from the three members who actually had them: Buckingham (\\"Trouble\\"), McVie (\\"Got A Hold On Me\\") and Nicks (either \\"Stand Back\\" or \\"Talk To Me\\"). Other than that, everything you could possibly want is hear. Definitely a must have.
B000002U82|5.0|Can you really? that is what makes them great. Decades after it's release this album is still refreshing to listen to. My parents like it and young people of this generation like it. Pink Floyd made a name for themselves then and it is plain to see they are legends today. I personally love \\"Any colour you like\\". Great song to just lay back and smoke to. Have a few drinks and play cards. Just play it on repeat.
B00005JMCT|5.0|Keep in mind that the title of my review and my rating of the film is not saying that this film, the third and final in the \\"American Pie\\" trilogy\\", has nothing wrong with it. There are quite a few flaws. For starters, where the heck's the cast?<br /><br />Jim, Alyson, Stifler, Kevin, Jim's dad and Finch return to the fold, but wihtout Vicky, Stifler's brother (who admittedly had a very small part but was hysterical when shown), Jessica, Oz, Heather, the Sherminator and especially Nadia (although her and Vicky are both referenced to at one point), the film does feel a little half baked at times.<br /><br />This one major qualm aside, \\"American Pie\\" otherwise measures up to the first two films in the series. I do agree with the many reviewers who said the film beloned to Sean William Scott. But unlike those reviewers, I look at this in a positive way, since his character Stifler provided us with such classic moments in the first two. I mean, who else could've done the pale ale scene so well in part one?<br /><br />In this film, Jim (Biggs) is finally ready to pop the question to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). She accepts, and things soon go haywire, and provide more classic moments to this already classic trilogy, including Stifler's dance off at a gay bar, that special haircut, and the bachelor party from hell. And since it's the unrated version, the bachelor party is even hotter.<br /><br />The extras are extremely intriguing. I haven't watched them all yet, but I'm sure they will be when I find the time.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite the cast being absent, this a truly great finale for this classic trilogy of teen sex comedies. Please, buy it as soon as possible (that is, after you see the first two).
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Criterion has done it again!  This Kurosawa release is breath taking in its sharpness, sound quality, and ease of reading subtitles which at times can be wrong and to light or dark.  These are perfect for those of us that do not understand Japanese. I thought years ago that the Criterion Laser Disc of this film masterpiece was terrific, but wait till you see this GREAT film done as only Criterion can do it on DVD.  Order it now, and enjoy it soon.
B00006JSS8|2.0|If you thought that the 1999 release of the excellent four disc boxed set \\"At The Close Of A Century\\" would finally put an end to the diarrhea - like flow of Stevie Wonder greatest hits, best of's, etc., think again. Three years after \\"ATCOAC\\" was released comes the single disc, 21 track \\"The Definitve Collection\\".<br /><br />What this cd has is basically some of Stevie's most recognizable number, arranged in chronological order. These songs are all among the finest pieces of music ever written, from \\"Fingertips\\" to \\"Living For The City\\" to \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" (yes, I know the last has been maligned amount a million times, but I feel it's a great song). The fact is that there is not enough of the good stuff. The producers tried to appeal to some hardcore fans by including the relatively unknown \\"Hey Love\\", which is inexplicable. They should have left this one off to included maybe two or three minutes more of \\"Do I Do\\" (which is inexplicably edited from ten minutes and twenty seven seconds to five minutes and four seconds).<br /><br />This cd is aimed at casual fans, but it doesn't even do them justice. I you're a beginning fan of Stevie, then \\"At The Close Of The Century\\" is the best place to start. However, if you're on a tight budget or just don't feel ready to be exposed to so much Stevie in one dosage, I recommend the two disc \\"Song Review\\", which is a far better representation despite inexplicably (and I know I've used that word a lot) leaving off \\"Fingertips\\", \\"For Once In My Life\\" and \\"You Haven't Done Nothing\\" and editing a number of tracks (though it does include the full version of \\"Do I Do\\"), or if you just want his groundbreaking 1970s' material, \\"Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium\\" will suit you well (though by leaving out the 1960s' and post - 1982 material, you're missing a big chunk of the Wonder legacy).<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you want the best of Stevie, search other venues, such as the boxed set or just seeking out the original albums. Anything but this piece of junk (again no disrespect to the music).<br /><br />(Note: I just want to say that I don't actually own this album. However, I have heard evry song on here, and know them well enough to write a review for this cd).ing but this piece of junk (again no disrespect to the music).    (Note: I just want to say that I don't actually own this album. However, I have heard evry song on here, and know them well enough to write a review for this cd).
B0007GAERG|1.0|Jewel's last album was a sellout, but at least it is good. Mariah Carey is coming on 50 years old. Pretending that she is a 25 year old just doesn't work on this album. The worst track is \\"We Belong Together\\" in which \\"Mimi\\" overemphasizes each note and squeals like an out of control whale. I am a former \\"lamb\\" and woke up to realize that Mariah Carey doesn't have any true talent.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|When I first heard Mariah was on the verge of releasing this album, I felt a little nervous. While I simply adore her and think that she has one of the best voices around today, I was expecting to be disappointed with the outcome of the album. Then I pressed play: I have to say I was more than impressed I was astonished. Mariah had been able to turn herself around and <br />emancipate herself from her last few disappointing albums....the voice is back. While she has managed to adapt to the sounds and images of today, she manages to hold onto her roots, which is very impressing, considering the fact that not many people can migrate from decade to decade while still holding on to their fanbase while adding to it simultaneously. Here is my breakdown of the album: <br /> <br />1. It's Like That: Great first single however, Jermaine Dupri is a little to prevalent in the song. Very catchy up tempo beat, and Mariah looks hot in the video! 5/5 <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together: One of the most beautiful songs she has ever written. Chilling to the bone her voice is sort of haunting in this one. Very glad that it is a single. I can only imagine the remixes. 10/5 <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off: Not one of my favorites of the album, although it has a good beat. 2/5 <br /> <br />4. Mine Again: Very beautiful ballad. Reminds me of Vision of Love in a strange way. Still, Mariah flies solo in this one, so it's a very beautiful song. 4/5 <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin': Snoop and Mimi reunite!!! I loved Crybaby, and their chemistry is great in this song as well. Very well put together. Sort of has a 70's vibe to it. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Stay the Night: Very catchy lyrics. The song gets stuck in your head, but that's not a bad thing. I love the melody on this one. 4/5 <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number: For some reason I haven't been able to take a liking to this song. I can't put my finger on it. Not one of my favorites on the album. Maybe it's JD again :(. 2/5 <br /> <br />8. One and Only: I didn't really care for this song either.It's a slower song, but it doesn't excite me. Maybe it's because she's rapping in this one. 2/5 <br /> <br />9. Circles: I enjoy this one. It has an \\"Underneath the Stars\\" feel to it. Very catchy and it flows very nicely. Mariah's voice shines nicely in this one. 4/5 <br /> <br />10. Your Girl: One of my favorite songs on the album. It carries a 70'sesque vibe with it very charming and catchy. I blast this one in my car frequently :) 8/5 <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew: Starts off like \\"Yours\\", but sounds very-gospel like. Very nice ballad. 3/5 <br /> <br />12 To the Floor: I have a feeling that this will be the next single. It's very catchy and up beat. An excellent club song in my opinion with a great potential for some awesome remixes. 4/5 <br /> <br />13 Joy Ride: Yet another one of Mariah's beautiful ballads. Her voice carries the song so beautifully. I get goosebumps. 4/5 <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird. Mariah's signature gospel ballad. Very empowering and beautiful song. I like this one a lot. Especially the message it evokes. 5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />With that said, this album is a substantial improvement over her last few works. I think Mariah realized what worked for her as well as her fans, and she went with it. Her voice truly shines in songs she sings herself, but her collaborations have something to be said for themselves as well. This is a terrific album if you are a die-hard MC fan. You will not be disappointed. I am accepting her emancipation with \\"Open Arms.\\" :)
1573223085|5.0|Sometimes you get a book that you think is great, but with which you simply do not agree.  <br /> <br />In this book the author says that the world is changing based on three fundamental forces: Abundance, Asia, and Automation. And to survive (perhaps thrive would be a better world) in the next century you need to ask  <br />Can someone overseas do it cheaper?  <br />Can a computer do it faster?  <br />Do the goods and services I offer satisfy one of the nonmaterial desires of an abundant age?  <br /> <br />Yes, we are in a period of abundance.  <br />Yes, Asian manufacturing is replacing western manufacturing (and will in turn be replaced by even cheaper places like Africa).  <br />Yes, automation is encroaching on traditional manufacturing.  <br />Yes, the schools in Asia are turning out extremely competent programmers, engineers, even research scientists (just look at the number of patents issued to Japanese companies).  <br /> <br />His conclusion is that 'right-brained' people are needed in the emerging economy. <br /> <br />Two problems:  <br /> <br />Asian people have right brains too. There elements of design, music, and so on are good too.  <br /> <br />But the biggest problem with the book can be found by examining the Index. Go down to the \\"O's\\" and you find \\"Ohga, Norio\\" followed by \\"Olivier, Richard.\\" There's something missing here -- the word \\"Oil.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyone who hasn't considered the upcoming changes being brought up us by the decreasing availability of and increasing demand for oil hasn't finished his thinking.  <br /> <br />For instance:  <br />Abundance - How much of abundance comes from plastic. What happens when plastic goes up 1000% in price?  <br />Asia - it's a long way to ship things, and transportation is going to get much more expensive.  <br />Automation is a tricky thing. At one time big factories were highly automated to build computer motherboards. They were so difficult to change that they were abandoned and motherboards arenow produced semi-automatically at best.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: Good book in forcing you to think about the future, but it's only half done. Replacing oil is going to take a lot of left brain work.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Each song is given a tamale rating for how HOT it is!  5 tamales is the hottest. <br />_______________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />1.) It's Like That - This song is hot. It's a great song to listen to when drinking, or getting ready to drink, or whatever. \\"Cause it's my night, no stress, no fights, I'm leaving it all behind. No tears, no time to cry. Just making the most of life.\\" 4 tamales. <br /> <br />2.) We Belong Together - The first time I heard this song, I didn't turn it off for two straight weeks. I think everyone has been able to relate to the lyrics in this song at some point. This song is a prom night song, meaning I can picture dancing to it at my senior prom. 5 tamales. <br /> <br />3.) Shake It Off - One of my favorites on the cd. It has a nice easy groove that reminds me of Breakdown. Again, easy to relate to the lyrics... Trying to get over someone who's been playin' you, or otherwise not treating you how they should. 4.5 tamales. <br /> <br />4.) Mine Again - Mariah in full voice, belting out only the way she can, but still showing amazing control. Good lyrics, sweet and sultry melody... Smooth and clean. 3 tamales. <br /> <br />5.) Say Something - This is a jam! When Mariah and Snoop get together, good things happen. This could be a hit if released as a single. It's hot. Uptempo, but not a dance number. Good tune. 4 tamales. <br /> <br />6.) Stay the Night - Another midtempo jam. Mariah trying to convince a man to stay over for the night. Like anyone would need convincing. Good tune, nice beat. MC in full voice. 3 tamales. <br /> <br />7.) Get Your Number - One of Mariah's hottest jam. If this is released as a single, it would be a ..1 for sure. Hot club song. Can't even really describe it. This and We Belong Together are the hottest tracks on this record. 5 tamales <br /> <br />8.) One and Only - Another midtempo tune, MC seems to be fond of them on this album, and rightly so. She shines in them, and this song isno exception. Twista's rap compliments the song. 3 tamales. <br /> <br />9.) Circles - Great midtempo number. Mariah doing what she does best... Wrapping complicated lyrics around a beautiful melody and making it sound like a million dollars. 4 tamales <br /> <br />10.) Your Girl - This track is definatly different, but I like it. Kind of reminds me of \\"Boy\\" (from Charmbracelet), although its a totally different type of song. 3 tamales <br /> <br />11.) I Wish You Knew - Probably Mariah's 10th song about loving someone who doesn't know. Basically meant to be performed live... (The cd even has Mariah addressing an audience...) Mariah singing about having an \\"inferiority complex\\" is a stretch, but this song is relatable to most people. Nice ballad. 4.5 tamales <br /> <br />12.) To the Floor (Tonight) - Another hot party record. Nelly makes an appearance to spice it up. It's definatly a jam. Keeps the party feeling of the album going. 4 tamales. <br /> <br />13.) Joy Ride - Slow an easy jam... Feels like a sequel to \\"4th of July\\" or \\"Bliss\\"... Same slow and sensual beat and melody. Nice. 3 tamales. <br /> <br />14.) Fly Like a Bird - Could play out well as a single on a christian music station. Definatly shows Mariah's gospel roots and is change of pace from the rest of the album. Features Mariah's pastor speaking in the begining. 3 tamales.  <br />
B000002N2Z|3.0|Considering this genre of music (nu-metal, alternative metal, etc.) I think the Deftones were definatly at the top of the game from the beginning. Nu-metal, rap metal, and alternative metal bands usually just plain suck, but Deftones albums manage to pull together enough interesting influences, smart musical ideas, talented musicianship and good hooks to earn them all at least an \\"above average\\" grade. <br /> <br />Adrenaline is a good album. It's not amazing, or even very consistent, and to be completely honest, it's probably their worst album, but it's definatly still good. I was blown away when I first heard this. I thought to myself, \\"an alternative metal band with guitars that sound like actual guitars, instead of massive bubbly farts? And the guitars are playing actual RIFFS, instead of overdistorted power chords laden with hip sound-effects?\\" Hardly believeable. In truth, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this album, but the reason I gave it only 3 stars is because, although the energy level is high and the playing is great, some of the songs don't really go anywhere. \\"Engine Number 9\\", in particular, sucks. \\"One Weak\\" starts off pretty decent, but it's poorly arranged and not very interesting, so it usually passes by without me even noticing.  <br /> <br />Overall, though, the band sticks with good riffs, and keeps the listener entertained with plenty of nice tempo-changes, off-kilter arrangements, and smart transitions.  <br /> <br />The songs on Adrenaline are, on the whole, well-crafted, but when they're not, they're pretty annoying and sometimes so mediocre that they go unnoticed, and Chino's voice got MUCH better later. Also, a lot of these songs sound pretty similar to one another. The production is awesome, so sure all the songs SOUND cool, but a well-trained ear will realize that some of the riffs on here are pretty awkward. Although this is a good raw high-energy album, it's missing the stylistic diversity and texture of their later albums.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is my second favourite right after the Hybrid Theory. As their debut this cd offers all great songs from the beginning to the end. Foreword is just an introduction, it's not a real song, it's just a mixture of sounds. My least favourite song on this album would be Session, which is like Cure For The Itch from the first cd, it's an instrumental song with sampling from Mr. Hahn. Don't Stay is a great song, with quite some rap in the chours, and Chester and Mike make it sound really good. Somewhere I Belong has an easier beginning with great chours and a bit less of rap throughout the whole song. Hit The Floor is a song with much more rap. Nobody's Listening is almost rap throughout the song, with interesting beginning and some flute samples in it. Figure.09 is a song with just a little rap, with great chours. There is much more rap in Lying From You. So, now to my favourites from this album. Beginning with Breaking The Habit. It is an easy song, with really catchy chours, but not much rap in it. From the Inside is also an eays, slower song right till the end, and then some hard rock makes it sound so good. Faint has one of the best beginnings, while the rest of the song is typical Linkin park song. Easier To Run is my second favourite song. It's a slower song, with a bit more heavier chours. There's also quite some rap in it. And then there's Numb. My favourite Linkin Park song probably (it's hard to decide). This one is also a bit easier in some parts and really hard-rocking in other parts. Every time I hear the piano/keyboard beginning I go crazy.<br />So, this is Meteora, the follow up to Hybrid Theory. Although I like Hybrid Theory a bit more, that doesn'z mean that this one is any worse. They're both great.
B000002NIW|4.0|But I hope that the Deftones will always be recognized as a great band, regardless of labels. While Korn was spending all their time ripping off Faith No More with over-distorted power-chords and an effects processor, the Deftones were busy writing amazing, well-developed songs full of texture, beauty, and real aggression. Around the Fur is much more mature than Adrenaline, displaying much more stylistic diversity. Chino's voice sounds much better than it did on Adrenaline too. Adrenaline was a high-energy, awesome album, but it lacked focus, texture and subtlety.  <br /> <br />But this album has almost everything except...Consistency? hmmm, I think that's the only flaw of this album. \\"Lhabia\\" is pretty awesome, but there's a COMPLETELY unnecessary, annoying distorted screaming part that gives me a headache in the middle and at the end. Not only that, but the riff-less screamy messes called \\"Lotion\\" and especially \\"Headup\\" are TERRIBLE songs, and definatly the worse songs they've ever done! I HATE Soulfly...why doesn't Max rejoin Sepultura? Roots wasn't THAT bad, it was still a good album! Okay back to the Deftones...Around the Fur really is a great album, but still not perfect.
B000069CWE|5.0|I like it. I just loved Hybrid Theory and I think that this idea, to make remixes of the songs on their debut album is just great. Besides the songs from Hybrid Theory, they also made remixes of another two songs. These are My{Dsmbr (My December) and H! Vltg3 (High Voltage). My personal favourite songs are: P5hng Me A*wy and H! Vltg3. Another great songs are Enth E Nd and Krwlng (I especially like the easy beginning at this song). I also have to mention PPr:Kut which is remixed really great by Cheapshot/Jubacca/Rasco/Planet Asia (there's much more rap in it). This would be my favourites, but that doesn't mean that other songs aren't good. They're great. I think that Linkin Park and their guests (for example: Aaron Lewis, Jonathan Davis, Jay Gordon and others) did a great job putting this cd together.
B00007G1ZC|3.0|This is definitely not one of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces.     As its title suggests, the movie is a loose series of dream-like vignettes that echo some of the themes in AK's previous films, with stylized bits of autobiography tossed in. These \\"dreams\\" are arranged in rough chrono-biological order, from childhood to manhood to old age; in between we get scenes of war and environmental catastrophe. Sprites, ghosts, and demons abound. The supernatural elements are reminiscent of Masaki Kobayashi's Kwaidan, from which Kurosawa probably lifted his Snow Maiden episode.     Sure, there are some striking images painted in gorgeous hues, but the whole affair is curiously uninvolving. It's also painfully didactic. Two of the dreams, \\"Red Fuji\\" and \\"Weeping Demon\\", are dated, simplistic, Cold War-era anti-nuke polemics that reminded me of nothing so much as those cheesy Godzilla flicks, minus the campy fun. (Perhaps the cheesy effects are Kurosawa's little tribute to his former AD, Inoshiro Honda, who directed the original Godzilla.) The last dream, \\"Watermill Village\\", starring the usually subtle and superb Chishu Ryu, is a kitschy luddite fantasy about the perfect little ecotopian village. Okay, I'll admit that this quaint little \\"village\\" is the epitome of bucolic loveliness (in real life--as opposed to \\"reel\\" life--it's a popular tourist trap, part of the large Daio wasabi farm in Nagano prefecture). But Ryu's wise-old-man schtick is just too damn corny and preachy in this scene. The upshot of all these dreams is: science and technology are bad (mmmkay?), modern man is arrogant and stupid, we should return to medieval village life and learn to live in harmony with Mother Nature. Kindergarten Taoism, in other words.     The sophomoric, heavy-handed Dreams is such a comedown from Kurosawa's wonderfully subtle, multi-faceted masterpieces of the '50s and '60s. Frankly, this simple-minded bagatelle is a little embarrassing coming from the towering cinematic genius who gave us Ikiru, Seven Samurai, and Red Beard. Someone should have told Kurosawa that only Freudian shrinks want to hear about other people's dreams.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well, this cd became my favourite right after I heard it for the first time (a couple of months after it was released) and it has been my favourite since. I never heard of them before, but it said where I bought it, that their music was somewhere near Limp Bizkit (which I really liked then). So I bought it. And loved it. It's much, much better than any other band in this nu-metal genre. The best thing about Linkin Park is, that they have two singers. Mike with his rapping and Chester with his rocking. They're just a great  singing duet. And the best thing about Hybrid Theory is, that there isn't any bad song on it. It even doesn't have any mediocre song. Every song is awesome.<br /><br />My favourite song is definitely Runaway. It's an excellent mixture of rocking, a bit of rapping and a little screaming which gives it that perfection.<br /><br />Right after Runaway are Crawling and In The End. It goes the same for those songs as for Runaway. But there is also a part with piano in the beginning and in the end of In The End, which is what makes it so good.<br /><br />In the song A Place for My Head there is a great beginning and more rapping than in other songs. Pushing Me Away starts easier but the chours is great rock , with a bit less of rap in it. One Step Closer is a pure rock song with no rap. By Myself, With You and Forgotten are great mixes oh hard rock and quite some rapping. In the song Forgotten there is even more rapping. It's similar with Papercut, which is a great opening song, with really cool beginning. And in the end, there is Cure For The Itch, which is completely different song. It's instrumental song, with lots of sampling DJ Hahn (that's my least favourite song, so I give it only 9,9 out of 10).<br /><br />This cd is just awesome from beginning to the end. Yeah, that's my favourite one.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower follows the life of a young boy who just entered high school and all of the situations he is thrown into. It ranges from events involving drugs to homosexuality to acting in a local showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The book is written in a format where Charlie is writing to this unknown person about his day. It starts off with the suicide of a friend and dives deep into Charlies life, his crushes, his mistakes, his faults, and his ideas.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I can tell you: this is one of my favorite bands. There has been a shakeup in the band. I am not sure who is in the band anymore. I know Mark Lanegan and Nick Oliveri are gone. It's only Joshua Homme and his friends. It's not much different from the Desert Sessions. That was one of my favorite records of the previous year or so. This has the sound of a great album. \\"Medication\\" has the heavy song of anything on their last album. \\"Everybody Knows That You Are Insane\\" is a slower song that is like classic rock of the 1970s. \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\" is this album's \\"Nobody Knows\\" except there's not any Dave Grohl or death metal bass guitar by Oliveri. Most of the album's greatness is in the middle section where there is a trio of songs: \\"In My Head\\" (from Desert Sessions), the first single, \\"Little Sister\\" (has a great build up and crazy guitar solo), and the gentle and moving \\"I Never Came.\\" This album has a bunch of killer tracks overall. Lanegan and Chris Goss actually show up on this record. So do Shirley Manson, Brody Dalle, and Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), and a few other Desert Sessions alumni. There is no dead weight. The Queens make music so effortlessly now, that it doesn't seem like hard work. They make great albums look easy. They are not really much like any bands out there. Joshua Homme is a musical genius. This is another brilliant record.<br /><br />I can't believe that no one reviewed this yet.
B00005JNTV|4.0|If you like violence, you may be a little bit disappointed like myself. The movie is not really violent becasue most of the killing are done by the good guys.  There is no comparsion to the real violence in the HBO Spawn TV series.  Beside all the killing and sex and stuff like that, the movie is full of motion. Things move in this movie.  They don't stand still by the dialogs.  They really make a comic book alife.  This puts Stan Lee's The Hulk to shame.  Well... he tried. <br /> <br />They have a wonderful casts.  I was WOW by the number of familiar faces in this movie.  The reason for me to go see this movie is Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis.  Jessica Alba really can dance and she is very sexy in the movie. <br /> <br />The only thing that is not that good in this movie is that about 3/4, the movie is getting a little bit boring. After that, it gets back to action. And the most terrible thing is that they only give Jessica Alba very short screen time.  They should show her dance longer, and give her more dialogs.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well, it looks like ALL of her competitors have their henchmen out on Sunday. Of all days, the Lord's day. You get away with nothing before God and neither will these imbeciles that keep spamming with one star. That surely doesn't take any amount of imagination. But regardless of how many 1-star reviews surface, this is a GREAT album. Not matter if it sells 1 million or 10 million, Mariah can be very proud of this CD. None of the endless negativity can take away from this excellent recording. This is a classic. People have been rattling off the names of wannabe divas, but who cares? I don't. I know who represents my voice, MARIAH!!! I could care less about these twenty somethings that have ruined music forever with their weak vocals and unintelligible lyrics. Heck if I'm going to idolize any of those pop tarts. Mariah's the real deal and always has been. Listen up spammers, keep steppin'. Mariah has already sold 100M+ albums worldwide, so give it up. Mimi has been emancipated. Thank God for Mariah Carey. Her music brightens my day.
B000002KIE|4.0|This is a pretty good album. Not as good as any album by The Ramones or The Clash, but still worth having as part of your CD collection. Why bash Green Day? Green Day is a teriffic band, and their CDs are better than this one, I must say. The best song on this album is \\"Holidays in the Sun\\", in my book.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|This is another dark and disturbing motion picture, which centers on Christian Bale (Trevor Reznik), a lathe-operator in some machine shop somewhere. He suffers from insomnia and by his words, \\"has not slept in over a year\\". His insomnia has directly affected his physical appearance as well, coming across as some sort of crystal meth junkie. His employer is concerned, and drug screens him regularly. He only has two personal contacts throughout the picture, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a hooker; and some waitress at the airport coffee show which he frequents at 1:25 A.M every morning. <br /> <br />Christian Bale's physical transformation in this film is frightening. He's a walking skeleton, a virtual bag of bones. Part of his morning routine is the act of weighing himself, which he records on sticky note pads and posts to his bathroom wall. The first weight posting we see is 107 pounds, and he resembles the Donnie Wahlberg character in the beginning of the Sixth Sense. Figuring his normal weight is probably 165 -170 pounds, how he's lost all the weigh for this role just boggles the mind.... and of course, pivotal to the plot of this film. <br /> <br />Jennifer Jason Leigh also looks pretty bad. Of course if she's going for that burnt out trashy street walker look, then she's succeeded in spades. Not to mention that the weight Christian lost, somehow found its way to Leigh must have been an added bonus for the director. <br /> <br />Besides the massive weigh lost, Reznik has also started to hallucinate, and paranoia is beginning to set in. He's unable to keep his mind on his job at work, which leads to a fellow employee losing his arm. A pretty cool scene by the way...... <br /> <br />The beginning of the film is well paced and keeps you on the edge of you seat. You find yourself trying to decipher what is real, and what's not. This leads you on a rollercoaster ride through the thoughts and dreams of Reznik, all escalating to the pinnacle of the film..... which turns out to be just the opposite, a very anti-climactic ending. For me anyways. <br /> <br />Except for the ending, I found the film quite intriguing; though a letdown, the ending does answer all the questions that you may have of Reznik. I just felt it could have been so much more, and that it just missed its mark by a hair. I, however, do recommend seeing this film, and leave you to surmise your own conclusions. <br /> <br />[...]
B0001NBMEE|2.0|As a great fan of the Prince Valiant comic strip, I was eager to <br />see this film.  If only the producers had spent as much on writers and research as they spent on locations and photography they might have had something other than camp.  You will get to see Stirling Hayden before he learned to act and Vikings out of a parody of Wagnerian opera. If you want sword-play, plot and real acting, with authenticity and stunning scenery watch \\"The Vikings\\".
B00005JNPZ|5.0|There's nothing that I like more in this world than to be wrong about movie that I believed to be bad before I go see it, and then be wrong..... Of course, the opposite is true if I believed the movie to be good, and it's not. This, by the way, happens far more often than the later..... <br /> <br />Sorry....... I have started to ramble on..... again.... Back to the review. <br /> <br />Before seeing this film, I had the preconceived notion of this being another Will Smith finds the girl, loses the girl, only to find the girl again at the end movie. In part, I was correct; with one small exception, Kevin James. He steals this film in every scene he's in. <br /> <br />Will Smith, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, plays straight-man to Kevin James' Albert, and the chemistry works. <br /> <br />Alex is the \\"Date Doctor\\". With his coaching he believes he can help any man land his perfect soul mate. Albert is a rotund accountant on a team of accountants for the millionaire heiress Allegra Cole, whom Albert is in love. With Alex's help Albert is able to get up the nerve to ask Allegra Cole out, and the rest is comical genius. The Will Smith - Kevin James dance instruction sequence alone is more than worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> <br />[...]
B00009L1OB|5.0|As already said this is the 3rd DD album, dated 1983. It s a differnet path from thei first work (Duran Duran) and Rio. DD undertook a more rock-commercial path with songs like The Reflex and New Moon on Monday (dancing beat!). But for tme the beauty of this CD is in the other tracks: The seventh Stranger, a struggling ballad with SImon's voice at the top, Tiger Tiger, one of the most beautiful instrumental track ever, Shadows on your side, very 80's song with glittering music, The Union of the Snake, one of the most mature track of the album.<br /><br />DD are 4 albums: DD, RIO, this one and ASTRONAUT (their smashing 2004 come back album).<br /><br />If you liked RIO, this will bring you into a different direction; but it is needed if you want to get inot the soul and mood of this band.
B00005JN4H|3.0|First things first, If anyone who watches this film really believes that was Queen Latifah in the opening sequences, I have some Brooklyn Bridge deeds to sell you, as well as some oceanfront property lots still available in Kansas. Now that that's out of the way... <br /> <br />Taxi stars Queen Latifah and Jimmie Fallon. Latifah is a former bicycle messenger turned taxi hack, while Fallon is a New York City policeman who cannot drive. Fallon while reacting to a \\"bank robbery in progress\\" call employs Latifah to drive him the crime scene. Thus begins the arduous journey of our two co-stars.  <br /> <br />As you can surmise, the robbers successfully escape; Fallon is relieved of duty; Latifah loses her cab, and both must rely on each other to catch the guys (or in this case, bad girls).  <br /> <br />As in any buddy picture, the movie is only successful if the chemistry works between the stars. And though Fallon and Latifah aren't Gibson and Glover (Lethal Weapon), or even Chan and Tucker (Rush Hour), the camaraderie does work; and I did enjoy this film. <br /> <br />My rating: Wait for the Video <br /> <br />BTW... Obviously the cab sequence of changing from taxi to supped-up hotrod must have cost a great deal of money..... The sequence is shown three different times throughout the movie..... At some point you're sitting there saying to yourself, \\"ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!! Get to the Chase!!!!!!!!\\" <br /> <br />[...]
B000002H70|5.0|Let me just say that this album is so captivatingly good that I judge and compare all albums, by any artist or group, by the standard of 'Disintegration' by The Cure.  <br />1989's 'Disintegration' is a journey and a mood-piece contrasting from the endearingly understated beauty and sadness of tracks 'Love Song' and 'Pictures Of You' to the alluring yet painfully desperate epics of 'The Same Deep Water As You' and title track 'Disintegration' - hearing Robert Smith's emotion in his voice in these two particular songs almost brings me to tears.  <br /> <br />'Disintegration' is an album of epic proportions, riddled with sublimely affecting guitar solos and sounds creating soundscapes corresponding so profoundly with Smith's lyrics of pain, loss, remorse, despair and reflection. The snyths, the effects and most notably Boris Williams fantastically big powerful drumming all culminate to create a profoundly layered atmosphere and musical direction, from the darkest yet most upbeat 'Fascination Street' (Simon Gallup's bass and Robert Smith and Porl Thompson's guitar work on this is particularly awesome), to the quirkiest song on the album and UK top 5 single 'Lullaby' with its clever lyrics and simple yet awesome guitar riff, to the absolute beauty of album opener 'Plainsong' and the closing 'Untitled' - that trademark Cure guitar sound never sounded so good! All this gives the album a thrilling sense of something special, something so affecting that its hard to imagine how it could be any better.  <br /> <br />In my opinion The Cure are the greatest band ever to grace this earth. I constantly ask myself how can a band famous for pop gems of the cheeky 1983 UK hit 'Love Cats', the happy and uplifting 1992 guitar jangle of 'Friday I'm In Love' and the jazzy 1985 hit 'Close To Me' be responsible for this? - an album of such emotional, musical and lyrical accommplishment. The Cure's musical variation is justifed in those timeless poppy singles and their hugely paradox albums, much evidenced in the 1981 goth classic 'Faith' and the helplessly dark and bearing 1982 Cure masterpiece 'Pornography' - this is indeed an eclectic band that rarley ever stuck to a particular style yet masterfully managed artistic invention and originality each time. From their initial punk offerings shown in 'Three Imaginary Boys'(1979)/'Boys Don't Cry'(1980) and the more minimal Seventeen Seconds(1980), to the aforementioned darkly brooding 'goth' moments of 'Faith', 'Pornography', 'Disintegration' and 'Bloodflowers'(2000), to their more commercial assorted pop thrills of 'The Head On The Door' (1985), 'Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me' (1987), 'Wish' (1992) and 'Wild Mood Swings'(1996) they managed to do it all without pretense just with a passion for music and its possibilities.  <br /> <br />Robert Smith and The Cure have been speaking to people for years with their music because life's two most bearing and powerful emotions are primarily made up of two things - happiness (elation) and sadness (melancholy). I love The Cure because they seduce, capture and manipulate these emotions in quite a euphoric, inspiring and dreamy yet comforting way. That in the negative, much like in the positive, lies beauty.  <br /> <br />Alas, Robert Smith and The Cure manage a journey into our psyche that only the very talented artists can seem to grasp, and 'Disintegration' demonstrates that perfectly.  <br />
B00005JNQQ|3.0|Robots is the newest creation brought to us from the same team that gave us Ice Age . I've seen Ice Age, and this is NO Ice Age.<br /><br />Robots is the story of Rodney Copperbottom voiced by Ewan McGregor , a young and enterprising inventor robot vying to one day work for the greatest robot of them all, Mr. Bigweld voiced by Mel Brooks. Rodney leaves the security of his home, parents, and small town to fulfill his dreams of working in the big city for Bigweld Enterprises. Whilst on his journey, he is befriended by a rag-tag group of robots called the Rusties, headed by Fenders (who is voiced by Robin Williams). Unbeknownst to Rodney, a young and upcoming robot called Ratchet (voiced by Greg Kinnear) has plans to annihilate all older model robots by stopping the production of repair parts. Any robots needing repairs must upgrade their model, or parish to the underworld of scrap-metal; ruled by Ratchet's mother, Madam Gasket.<br /><br />The CGI in this film is visually phenomenal; however, the storyline reeks and the dialogue hardly clever. The film spends exuberant time on multiple disconnecting scenes such as the \\"city transit system\\" and \\"domino falling\\" sequences, which are beautiful to watch; however, meaningless to the plot of the film. A little more TLC on this film would have done wonders; it truly has potential of being special, but falls short.<br /><br />[...]

B00079018K|4.0|Disc: Like most of the others I was disappointed in the copy protection features.  My computer has the best speakers in the house, so when I discovered I couldn't play the music without some kind of wonky program I was pretty ticked.  Fortunately I discovered you can listen to the actual CD audio on your computer by holding down shift for a few seconds after you insert the disc.  This disables a program it otherwise installs on your computer without asking you.<br /><br />Music: No complaints here.  The only possible niggle is that the individual songs kind of run together for parts.  Otherwise, I find the music to be quite original.  Some trancy, some rocky, some poppy.
B0007OCG56|3.0|This is your typical James L. Brooks film, which you could commonly classify as your average chick flick (The Word Spy - chick flick). The film features Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni, Paz Vega, and Cloris Leachman (who I just love in this film). <br /> <br />The movie follows the lives of Flor Moreno (Vega) and her daughter Christina. The film is the retelling of the events which lead to the opening sequence of the movie, the reading of Christina's application letter to Princeton. As we learn very early on in this film, Flor is a single parent, bound and determined to provide a better way of life for her daughter. Subsequently, Flor decides to flee Mexico, with her daughter along side, to find the American Dream in Los Angeles. With help from her cousin, she is able to land a housekeeping position with an upper income family, the Clasky's. It's Flor's employment with John and Deborah Clasky (Sandler and Leoni), that the film focuses. <br /> <br />This film has all the elements that you want and need for this type of film to work; however, it just falls short of making you care about any of these individuals. There's your successful chef (John) who wishes to be not as successful, your cheating spouse (Deborah), your alcoholic mother (Evelyn), the ever-caring housekeeper (Flor) and her always thankful daughter (Christina); but somehow the events being presented are just a compilation of stories strung together. We know that John loves his family and makes every attempt to be there for them (even giving up interest in his restaurant in order to be home more), but his wife is still able to have an extra-marital affair. We are told that Flor loves the Clasky children; however, we are presented with only the clothes alteration story as proof. Finally, the \\"I love you\\" scene at the end of the film is just totally off base, and comes out of nowhere. <br /> <br />If you are looking for your typical Adam Sandler Film, you're not going to find it in this film. And though this is not one of James Brooks' better productions, it's not horrendous. <br /> <br />[...]
B00076ZZ84|4.0|If you haven't bought Avril's Under My Skin album than you might as well get the DualDisc version, but only if you're fan.  The 2-CHANNEL LPCM version of the album on the dvd side sounds pretty much the same as the regular cd side but you do get a few of her videos and a cute but somewhat unneccesary video documentary on her tour in the UK.  You see Avril goofing off, flirting, and basically being an annoying teenager, all while being surrounded by her friends/managers/who knows.  Interesting, but it takes away from the actual music, and that's what this album is all about.
B00005JNEW|3.0|<br />To pontificate the statement, \\"If you ain't playing football, you ain't sh@#!\\" basically sums up this whole movie. What's more poignant is if you are playing football, you'd better be winning state championships; the key being WINNING state championships, because just getting there isn't good enough. <br /> <br />The movie's setting takes place in a small Texas town named Odessa, whose only existence centers around high school football. Where the school's football coach earns more money than its principle, and the high school football stadium is the town's single most treasured possession. Where there is no room mediocrity and losing is not a choice. Where winning is everything, and the Texas state championship game the city's only gauge of a successful season. <br /> <br />Billy Bob Thorton plays Coach Gary Gaines, Odessa's messiah. He is the man in which all of the city's hopes and dreams rest. The only person who will be held accountable, if the team does not reach its lofty goal. Only to be the person who is consistently second-guessed at any and every opportunity. The city's Golden Boy, when the team's winning; and the city's Sewer Boy, when they're not. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the film, emotions are running high as the Permian High Panthers are expected to make a run at this year's state championship (again). All their expectation's are resting on the back (and legs) of their star running back, Boobie Miles. <br /> <br />Everything is just peachy-keen, until Boobie tears his ACL, Anterior Cruciate Ligament (knee), in a freak tackling injury with 1:21 remaining in the inaugural game of the season in which Permian High was leading 42 - 7. <br /> <br />What transpires next is a series of games, and the events which re-mold the team, players, and strengthen family relationships. There's no hope for the town however. Its still just as screwed up at the end of the film as it was at the beginning. I guess that was too much to ask for anyways. <br /> <br />The film effectively communicates the football frenzy that envelops this small town; however, fails miserably in making us care about these individuals. There is nada, zero, zilch character development. <br /> <br />For example, Coach Gaines, what do we know him? He's married, has a daughter, and coaches high school football period. Where did he come from? What's his career history? Why has he had to move so often, that his daughter questions will they be moving again? <br /> <br />Mike Winchell, starting quarterback: What wrong with his mother? Is she physically or just mentally deranged? Where his father? Was that his brother that he was on the phone asking to come back? If so, where is his brother? <br /> <br />Boobie Miles, star running back: Where are his parents? Why does his uncle have custody of him? <br /> <br />You have seen this film time and time again from \\"Varsity Blues\\" to \\"Remember the Titans\\" to \\"All the Right Moves\\" and \\"The Program\\" and this film doesn't teach us anything that we do not already know. Do these towns exist? You better believe it! Would I want to live there? No way in hell.... <br /> <br />Did I enjoy the film? It was far better than having a hot poker plunged into my eye! <br /> <br />[...]

B0006SSOHC|5.0|This another extraordinary film that did not due too well during its theatrical release, but I highly recommend. However, this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The film revolves around a serial killer who doesn't kill people himself; but rather, places people in intricate situations which require difficult decisions to be made in order to stay alive.<br /><br />The victims selected are not the pillars of society. It's this collection of individuals, which is the key to the whole plot of this film and eventually the identity of the killer. These people are throwing away the one true thing the killer cherishes, and that's live itself. So they are forced to prove their right to life in an elaborate set of tests or die trying.<br /><br />I would categorize this film as a thriller; however, the killings do have a touch of gore to them. I love films that stretch the imagination and develop new and exotic ways to tell an age old story, and this film does just that.<br /><br />The film's title is a foreshadowing of things to come from almost the beginning of the film. Two complete strangers Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell wake up in a dark, and dingy bathroom only to find themselves chained by their legs to separate walls of the room. While rummaging around the room, a sack is found and in it are two hacksaws. The hacksaws are not strong enough to cut through the chains which are binding our main characters, what do you suppose the hacksaws are to be used?<br /><br />At the same time, Danny Glover plays a cop also searching for our mysterious killer, commonly referred to as Jigsaw because of these complex games he forces his victims to play.<br /><br />Again, the gruesome murder scenes almost elevate this film to a horror flick. However, the well told story line, elaborate plot, and the plot twist at the end; will leave you completely satisfied that you viewed this movie.<br /><br />[...]
B00029NMRW|3.0|The original cast return for an unecessary sequel of the much funnier original nine yards movie, and work hard to lift this picture above forgettable. Bruce Willis is now an apron sporting homemaker getting in touch with his feminine side and hiding in Mexico with his new hitman wife Jill (Amanda Peet). Oz (Perry) is living the high life in LA with his new wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) still in dentistry but with a small arms factory in his lavish home. All appears well until Lazlo Gogalak (Pollack) emerges from prison and comes after them for murdering his son (also played by Pollack) in the first movie. What was a reasonable idea suffers badly from \\"Sequelitis\\" and comes across as little more than reworking old ideas. There are some funny moments, and the 98 minute run time moves quickly enough, without requiring to much concentration, but this picture is quickly forgotten. Everything seems to be overdone to try and squeeze cheap laughs, from Pollacks poor command of English, to Willis's apparent erectile dysfunction, and Perrys paranoia and confusion. All obviously ends well for our loving quartet, but the lack of any real surprises, and a very weak script don't help the end result. OK movie, but nowhere near as good as the first, and rent before buying is a must. The DVD also has non existent extras (unless you include one trailer and director commentary) adding to the whole feel that this package was a money driven exploit flick devoid of depth or intelligence.
0316172324|1.0|The author treats us to a rehash of things already written several times (one original,the others ' followers'). <br />Why then the bestseller status? Well,who knows,maybe some have short memories,or don't read anything until it is on some list. <br />not worth the money and time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I LOVE this album.  Her voice is beautiful and strong.  The album flows together and I love the old school sound of her songs. <br /> <br />It's easily one of my favorite Mariah Carey albums. <br /> <br />For those who have been disappointed in the past by her work, I recommend you buy this album.  You will NOT be disappointed.
0783229364|5.0|Somehow this film -with the wide perspective of almost twenty years- showed the opposite side of the coin of what Midnight Cowboy meant in the late sixties. The intentions are very similar but the tone in what it is told marks the difference. This is not just a simple comedy it's a fine satire about the insights of the Corporative World.<br /><br />Michael Fox made to my mind the best role of his career with this portrait of a risky youngster who will face the defying New York City in all the possible angles. His fresh acting style allows him to win as the daredevil employer of his own uncle the President of this huge Corporation. And the story , filled with unforgettable funny situations will define the ambition and the achievement's motivation for reaching the highest peaks the faster he can.<br /><br />Add besides a smart puzzle hidden behind stage, when in a clear homage to the Graduate he will be seduced by his boss wife, Aunt Vera and simultaneously he got involved sincerely with his aunt's lover. As you know all the main ingredients of a typical mistakes comedy and a fabulous cast made of this film one of the best ten comedies in the eighties, headed obviously by \\"When Harry met Sally\\".
038073186X|5.0|This is one of those books where the ending forces you to reframe the entire novel in a different perspective.  Similar to how the movie the 6th sense made you rethink all the clues you missed through out the story.  Dennis Lehane never disappoints, and I think you'll find this novel to be one of his best.
0553260111|4.0|this book kept me turning pages until the very end, and i must say the story had a lot of substance to it.  it's the story of a man who is found floating in the ocean, half-dead.  a doctor saves his life, and when the man wakes up he has no memory.  what begins is a heart-pounding race to find out who he really is, and why certain people are trying to kill him.  all he has to go on are a few clues--certain things he can do without thinking, a microfilm implanted in his hip with the address of a swiss bank, and flashes of memory that disappear all to quickly. <br /> <br />the characters and events are all believable, especially since jason makes mistakes when trying to lay his traps.  instead of being the james bond characters from the movies who can do anything and never screw up, jason DOES screw up once in awhile, making him more believable. <br /> <br />this is definitely one of those books you will not be able to put down!
B000000H57|5.0|Type O is my favorite band and this is my favorite CD of theirs, however type o isnt for eveybody. I could understand why people wouldnt like it cuz its melodic, and type o is said to be a heavy metal band but they arent really HEAVY metal. So if you dont like this CD, dont say it sux cuz it doesnt. you just dont like it and thats fine with me.
B000002VCQ|4.0|Whitney Houston made a name for herself with her voice on this undisputed piece of pop history, her debut album.  The songs and production are heavy in simplicity, yet her strong, incredible voice manages to surpass the bland production and lyrics, leading the listener to want more... and that's what makes this 10-track collection priceless, even 20 years later. <br /> <br />She nails each ballad on here; the sparkly \\"You Give Good Love\\" and graceful \\"Saving All My Love\\" being the best.  You can't help but love the few up-tempo tracks on here also (The vocal in the infectious \\"How Will I Know\\" is unforgettable).  While the album's filler are the 3 early duets, the soulful, tender \\"Hold Me\\" with Teddy Pendergrass is one of the album's high points, even though it is the closer. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great debut for one of the 20th century's greatest vocalists.  Despite somewhat forgettable production, Whitney makes the album memorable with her powerful voice, and establishes a pop gem that sounds pretty great, even today.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I actually believe that this is Mariah's best album. The 90's are gone so there's no point dwelling on the past. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is an excellent showcase for Mariah's stellar voice. This is without question one of the best albums of 2005. This album features excellent production by some of the music industry's most prolific producers. This album is a grand achievement for everyone that participated. It's really hard to give any of the songs low ratings because each one can really soar based upon it's own merits. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That 5/5 <br />2. We Belong Together 5/5 <br />3. Shake It Off 4/5 <br />4. Mine Again 5/5 <br />5. Say Somethin' 4/5 <br />6. Stay The Night 5/5 <br />7. Get Your Number 5/5 <br />8.

B000001Y5J|4.0|(...)You see, it takes intellect to like NIN and the typical generic rock deuch-bag is going to not like NIN because they aren't 'straight forward enough' or my favorite 'they aren't even a real band'.  If you have these feelings for Nine Inch Nails, (and are probably looking at this review just to see what all the weird NIN fans are writing about their favoite band), then please give this album a listen and become enlightened by the far more aggressive side of Trent Reznor.  This certainly is not Pretty Hate Machine or Downward Spiral, not in terms of genius but in terms of sound.  The guitars are much more heavy and obvious than regular NIN.  The vocals are so passionate and raw and lowd that you cant help but memorize every word within the first few listens.  My favorite song may have to be Last.  The riff is bad ass and that solo thing in the beggining is so fu#king sick.  Suck is a f*cking great song too.  They all are though, Wish is amazing, so is Happiness in Slaver, jesus f*cking christ that song rocks, Gave Up and Physical are just as essential too.  The two instrumentals are also good.  Like I was saying earlier, if you are alienated by the traditional (amazing) NIN sound and want something a little more straight forward then definetely buy Broken.  I wish my friends would give into it, there is a lacking of Nine Inch Nails fans around today.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|I thought this movie was terrible.  Very stupid and unbelievable.  Halle Berry was actually terrific though, and if it weren't for her, I probably would have turned it off after the first 10 minutes or so.  Robert Downey Jr., who is usually first class, is flat and uninteresting and the general plot is incredibly ridiculous. <br />What starts off as a promising story quickly turns into a circus, with Halle Berry becoming a patient in the very own facility in which she had practiced psychiatry just the day before (like that would ever happen).  One day she is treating patients, the next, she is one of them.  I'd tell you more but it's really not worth the time it would take to write it out.  However, if you love camp and you can sit through the movie long enough, you have to watch the scene where the mild mannered buttoned up sherrif suddenly turns into a raving shirtless tattooed psychopath.  Funny stuff.
B00028HBKM|1.0|For those who don't understand the christian bible, you will be lost for much of the movie.
B000002HMH|5.0|This band continues to evolve and whever thinks this album is bad needs to be shot. What are we going to have speed metal forever? IDIOTS say yes. This was the best album in my opinion that Metallica ever did. Bluesy and musical. Not just noise. Bleeding me is the best song they EVER did and the sound in general on this album (and RELOAD too) needs to be revisited after the disappointment of St. Anger. There is more to do in this genre for Metallica, simple as that!
B000002J6F|5.0|Stills once again PROVES he's a master composer and a mechanic on his chosen instruments. Non commercial sounding, yet every song feels like a hit. In 500 years from now, this will be one of the most studied bodies of work in music classes everywhere.
B000002HRE|5.0|Phenomenal CD----Black, Load and REload are the best series of albums EVER! Go back to this sound guys! Get away from the tin can beating crapola on St. Anger and listen to this bluesy sound. James' vocals, the guitar work and Lars' drums work perfectly in this sound.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The one star is for convincing these top name artists that this was a good idea.   <br /> <br />I didn't buy this movie, but it was so bad I was moved to write just based on the money I wasted on the rental.  The dialogue is unbelievable.  Who actually speaks like this?  The whole idea of 'love at first sight' I might buy into, but these characters immediately fall in love, can instantly tell when someone is lying (even though they just met a moment ago) and profess their devotion and love one second and then actually utter, \\"I just stopped loving you\\" the next moment.  And the language!  It's the closest thing to porn without actualy showing a single thing as you can get.  You'd better be real comforable with the 'c' word if you want to set through this.  I just can't understand when a big name director like Mike Nichols puts out something like this and it is praised as 'ART'.  The long emotionless face of Julia Roberts droning out lines without flashing her trademark smile is enough to wear you out.  Julia, you can show emotion without showing all 32 of your teeth.  Try it sometime.  This might be one of those movies you can rent to actually laugh at the dialogue, but that would be it's only redeeming quality.
B00062IDCO|1.0|If I wanted to judge the content of these DVDs I'd give it 5 stars, but I cannot tell you how angry I am that these wonderful discs had been packaged in that cheap, non functional, crappy looking piece of transparent plastic thingy no one would ever call a DVD case. I'm astonished that something this pricey would be packaged this way. All I can do is shake my head...
B0002OERI0|4.0|Let me just start out by being blunt by saying that this is the most mature and developed work that Greenday has ever put out, period. I must confess that I've never been much of a Greenday fan, for I could not look beyond their sophmoric lyrics and cheesy three-chord arrangments. <br />'American Idiot' is anything but sophmoric and cheesy. And while this is still very much a Greenday album, Mike Dirnt has since their last project in 2000 learned how to play the guitar, for example.  <br />Aside from the musical aspect, the guys take a new approach to their sound by following in the steps of bands that have gone before- punk bands such as  the Sex Pistols which focused more on politics than they did on partying.  <br />That being said, the lyrics are a bit deeper than projects of late- they've traded their \\"sometimes i give myself the creeps, sometimes my mind plays tricks on me\\" schtuff to a more mature approach on life by focusing on the state our country is in politically ('Jesus of Suburbia and Holiday). 'Zieg Heil to the president gasman- Bombs away is your punishment....Bang bang goes the broken glass and Kill all the fags that don't agree.' are some of the boldest, most beautiful lyrics these guys have written ever, I think.  <br />Their defintely on the right track; I am hoping that Greenday continue this upward spiral away from mainstream punk to continue exploring the more alternative and underground side of punk. <br />Kudos! <br />
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't know about the others, but I do think that Britney did a really good job on this album. It had some Kylie-Minogue/reggae influenced tracks. My favs are of course Me Against the Music, Outrageous, Showdown, Everytime, Toxic, (I Got That) Boom Boom, Touch of My Hand, and The Hook Up. I really like Britney's music, but I don't like her wild and crazy behavior. Hmm...I really don't know why I'm so into her. Maybe it's because she's fun and interesting.
B000000HHE|4.0|Like many reviews for this album i will also say the cliche' line \\"A breath of fresh air\\" because De La Soul were indeed a deep long full breath of fresh air. With this one compact disc De La Soul kickstarted an excellent Mcing career that has lasted over 15 years to this very day and are still producing and making excellent album. De La recorded this at the top of thier game and made a hip hop career out of posotivity and pride, and they deserve every thing they get:<br /><br />1.Intro-N/A<br /><br />2.The Magic Number-A+(2nd Best On Cd)<br /><br />3.Change In Speak-B+<br /><br />4.Cool Breeze On The Rocks-N/A<br /><br />5.Can U Keep A Secret-A<br /><br />6.Jenifa Taught Me-A<br /><br />7.Ghetto Thang-A<br /><br />8.Transmitting Live From Mars-N/A<br /><br />9.Eye Know-A+(3rd Best On Cd)<br /><br />10.Take It Off-N/A<br /><br />11.A Little Bit Of Soap-A<br /><br />12.Tread Water-A<br /><br />13.Potholes In My Lawn-A-<br /><br />14.Say No Go-B+<br /><br />15.Do As De La Does-N/A<br /><br />16.Plug Tunin'(Last Chance To Comprehend)-B<br /><br />17.De La Orgee-N/A<br /><br />18.Buddy-B+<br /><br />19.Description-B<br /><br />20.Me,Myself and I-A+(Best On Cd)<br /><br />21.This Is A Recording 4 Living In A Fulltime Era(L.I.F.E.)-A-<br /><br />22.I Can Do Anything-N/A<br /><br />23.D.A.I.S.Y.

B00003W8NM|5.0|One of my most favorite movies EVER!  This movie caught a lot of flak for its violence and some even declared it \\"fascist\\".  What a load of crap!  It's the most anti-fascist movie I can think of.  It shows you how people who are lost in this modern world (as many of us are) can be taken advantage of by a very charismatic person with an alterior motive.  The men who are attracted to the Fight Club are dulled by their mundane and de-masculinating modern lives, so the only way they can feel alive and like men is to beat the living crap out of eachother and commit boy-hood hijinx.  It becomes their support group, their way to make life bearable in our unbearably meaningless world.  Tyler Durden (Pitt) gives them meaning and the kind of macho comradery all men want, but he uses that to take advantage of them....to turn them into \\"Space Monkeys\\" (Watch the movie and it will all make perfect sense).    I like David Finchers work as a director, this is his best movie.  His dark style compliments the dark humor and mood of Fight Club VERY well.  I don't think any other major director could have done a better job.  (Watch out for the subliminal Tyler's in the first 20 minutes of the film, it's great.  Way to go Mr. Fincher!)    Brad Pitt IS Tyler Durden!  This movie made me come out of the closet as a Brad Pitt fan, he was just great in this movie.  Edward Norton was also well cast and did a great job, but Pitt made this movie shine.    Fight Club has fantasticly twisted dark humor that takes shot after shot at our culture.  If you like dark humor like me, you will love every moment if this movie.  Oh, and by dark humor I mean finding a terminally ill woman begging for one last sexual encounter before she dies funny... You can't get darker than that folks.  If you are easily offended DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.  (And if you are easily offended may I recomend you only watch Disney films.)    WARNING!: This is a total guy flik! Not many women will enjoy it!
B0000024JN|5.0|When it comes to early hip hop...the possibilities were'nt necessarilly endless. The rules basically were if you have some flow and a good dj you were in...oh yeah by the way, ya gotta be black. But Rick Rubin thought otherwise by signing these Jewish Manhattan MC's to his Def Jam label and made hip hop a household name in white suburban America. Not only did white kids love the Beastie Boys, but most hip hop lovers in general loved them. And judging by this album...i can see why:<br /><br />1.Rhymin & Stealin-A+<br /><br />2.The New Style-A-<br /><br />3.She's Crafty-A-<br /><br />4.Posse In Effect-B<br /><br />5.Slow Ride-B+<br /><br />6.Girls-B+<br /><br />7.Fight For Your Right-A+(3rd Best On CD)<br /><br />8.No Sleep Till Brooklyn-A+(Best On CD)<br /><br />9.Paul Revere-A+(2nd Best On CD)<br /><br />10.Hold It Now, Hit It-A<br /><br />11.Brass Monkey-A+<br /><br />12.Slow and Low-A<br /><br />13.Time To Get Ill-A
B00006WKY9|5.0|Ahh, i love this one! This classic Scorpions album has always been one of my absolute favorites!I feel that this masterpiece has to be one of the best hard rock albums that never got any credit and is extremely underrated. <br /> <br />The Scorpions fifth studio album is the darkhorse effort of their lofty back catalog of albums.Historically,this was the end of the first phase in the Scorps carrer in that it was their last outing with guitar wizard Ulrich Roth or better known as Uli Jon Roth.After this,Ulrich was gone for good and the band singed to Mercury records and started their string of commercial albums.This is the Scorpions at their artistic and experimental peak, never again would they delve into this kind of musical estacy displayed here.Uli Jon Roth must be heard to be belived,his guitar playing is absolute heavenly!I tell you, this guy could easily put Blackmore,Malmsteen,VanHalen or whoever to shame.The whole band on this album is exellent,Rudolf,Meine,Uli and Francis are firing on all cylinders.This is also the first album with Herman Rarebell on drums and he really adds that kick in the pant's to the rhythm section.The album is definatly one of the most dark,moody,experimental things this band has ever attempted. <br /> <br />STEAM ROCK FEVER 10/10 <br />A perfect song to kick off this album,has some great drumming and rhythm guitar which equals to one of their best songs. <br /> <br />WE'LL BURN THE SKY 10/11 <br />The best Scorpions song ever! clocking in at around 6 minutes,this song has a mix of beautiful melodies and skullcrushing power all displayed by top notch musicianship. <br /> <br />I'v GOT TO BE FREE 10/8 <br />A catchy song with some great rebellious lyrics. <br /> <br />RIOT OF YOUR TIME 10/8 <br />Acoustic guitar is used to great effect here. <br /> <br />SAILS OD CHARON 10/11 <br />Maybe the best song on the album.even though they took out the first 45 seconds of the song which was on the vinly,it's still lost non of it's power. imagine Jimi Hendrix. <br /> <br />YOUR LIGHT 10/10 <br />This one has a very moody begining part,overall a great song. <br /> <br />HE'S A WOMAN-SHE'S A MAN 10/10 <br />The funniest song lyricaly.This one is one of the heavist songs the Scorps have done. Many younger bands like Helloween have covered this one. <br /> <br />BORN TOO TOUCH YOUR FEELINGS 10/8 <br />This song is a ballad that is very emotional and is the proto-type for future Scorpion ballads like \\"Still Lovin You\\" or \\"When The Smoke is Going Down\\". <br /> <br />SUSPENDER LOVE 10/10 <br />Awesome! very funky drumming and muscular guitar playing. <br /> <br />POLAR NIGHTS-LIVE 10/12 <br />The best version of this song by far. The original was from Virgin Killer but this live version kills! Gotta love Uli's singing! <br /> <br />Many people think Virgin Killer is the best 70's era album but i don't think so at all. VK was great but i think this blows it out of the window completely!Taken By Force is just amazing to me! it's everything that i love about the Scorpions and hardrock/metal music;powerful,beautiful,emotional and just sublime.I definatly suggest you give it a try if you are interested in this kind of music.If you want to hear some of the most beautiful singing,here it is! Klause Meine has to be the greatest singer on the planet, he is taking his high-pitched melodic german-acented vocals to the absolute maximum and most sensual on this album.This is almost art put to music, i wish they would do more songs from this album and some of their other early stuff at their shows.Fortuantly,Uli Roth countiued to make some amazing music after he left starting with is solo album Earthquake, while the Scorpions adopted a crunchier heavy metal style with the addition of Mattiahs Jabbs and briefly brother Micheal Schenker.I love all era's of the Scorpions,they are my favorite band and it is interesting to see how they evolved over their 40 year carrer from their humble beginings in Hanover Germany.Their 72 debutLonesome Crow all the way to 2005's Unbreakable is really a remarkable run in musical evolution,let's be honest, how many band's have been around for 40 years and are still relevant today? My point exactly. <br /> <br />The Scorpions are musical genius.   <br /> <br />
B00006JSS8|1.0|The bottom line for me with this CD is that I don't want to put it on to listen to it.  There's far too much missing--\\"Isn't She Lovely\\" and \\"If You Really Love Me\\" for two--and quite a few songs that really don't belong on a \\"Collection\\" disc (I'd get rid of \\"Hey Love\\" and \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" to start with).  Stevie Wonder has always been a lot of fun to listen to, but this disc and its rather arbitrary arrangement and selection of tracks just doesn't cut it.  What a shame to have 21 tracks to work with and come up with these selections. . . . who gets paid for coming up with crap like this, anyway, and what are their qualifications?  I've always wondered. . . .
B000062YB1|5.0|1990's Seasons in the Abyss is Slayer's musical and artistic peak.It was the final album with lombardo as well(until now of couse) and is arguable a close to the traditional Slayer sound as they went for a more commercial approach after this. <br /> <br />This is with out a doubt slayers most solid effort, combinding the speed of R.I.B with the weighty melodic songwriting and mature lyrics of South of Heaven.You have a mixed bag of brutally fast and heavy slow songs on here which all contributes to this albums well-roundedness. \\"War Ensamble\\" \\"Blood Red\\" \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" \\"Hallowed Point\\" \\"Skeletons of Soceity\\" and the title track are the best songs here but even the lesser songs do an exellent job on this album. All four members are firing on all cylinders here, while this may not be the speed/satan/gore fest that Reign in Blood was, this is undoubtably better then that effort do to the qaulity of the songs, and don't worry, the song subjects are as macabre as ever with stuff dealing about gang warfare, a serial killer with a fetish for skin, hand-gun homicide, the Tienamen square incident and other lovely subjects.Slayer has simpley never been the same after this, so i don't consider it a loss if one were to end their Slayer colocetion after this album.With the release of God Hates Us All, pretty much all faith in this band has been flushed down the toilet and sent down to hell.It's sad that they don't do albums like this any more because it is their best by far.Just imagine if they countiued down this path insted of going Nu-Metal-core on us.This is essential Slayer though, i listened to this album all of the time and loved every minute of it.  <br /> <br />\\"Dead Skin Mask\\" is worth the price of this album alone, it is in my mind the best song Slayer ever wrote. if that isn't enough to entice you to buy it, i don't know what is.
B0002NRRAG|2.0|There is not doubt that this CD will be a commercial success. She sounds so nice. However, she is simply Billie Holiday. You are not listening to anything new. She will be nice to listen to live but will she ever become herself in time? If Peyroux happens to get out of Billie Holidays influence, then will anybody listen to her? Very nice but sad at the same time.
0143034901|5.0|For writing a very entertaining book that draws one into a labarynth of twists and turns starting from the first page...and dosnt let you go until you've finished the last page. I spent the week recalling a long list of memorable and dispicable characters by name, something I rarely have the patience for when I read a book. I have been to Barcelona and the book does it great justice.<br /><br />This is one of those books that you just don't want to end.
B0007OASII|5.0|They show some serious bravery in this work.They started it with a medium tempo song, full of ambient menace instead of the more speedy stuff of past openers of theirs.Also in the rest of the album the speed melodic metal trademark of Kamelot is mostly absent(but when it does appear is with the intensity of a razor-sharp knife of melodic intensity and ferocity: When The Lights Are Gone and Soul Society, for example)from this album, The Black Halo.Lyrically is not so much of a secuel to their Epica work but a deeper examination of the themes already introduced.It most be said that they perfected the mid-tempo songs in this cd, making them more fun than past efforts made on this style(for instance, a mid-tempo song like Carry On on Epica was clearly a non memorable track)examples of this are excellent tracks like This Pain and MoonLight.And although the music is not technical metal by any means, the vocal lines are the most challenging and complex that Kamelot have done yet. <br />So, with this daring and moving work Kamelot is closer to match Iron Maiden in sheer volume of masterpieces one after another(Maiden: from Killers to Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and Kamelot: from The Fourth Legacy to The Black Halo). <br />Do I need to say more?...Highly Recommended!!!!! <br />
0312997221|5.0|I was fool enough to think, that because this book was shorter than other Forsyth novels I've read, that the old man might be losing it. Boy, was I wrong. This little page-turner packs a wallop like a sawed-off shotgun, or a very small woman whose powers can subdue a man twice her size and leave him breathless.  Tom Clancy or Stephen King would need 3 times the space to pack that much firepower.  This eclipses \\"The Negotiator,\\" and is nearly up there with \\"Day of the Jackal,\\" and \\"Odessa File.\\"  What Sidney Sheldon did in the '70s, Forsyth continues doing even now--and better yet.
B0007OCG56|3.0|Spanglish, I was hoping, would be a great movie but instead it's just sweet. It has it funny parts, by leachman, and it touching parts too. All is in the film. What it lacks is it lags a little too long in some parts.
B000002J1O|5.0|Until recently, my knowledge of Genesis did not expand past Duke, so I never knew them for being anything but a trio. Though I do enjoy the quality of their music. I've never been a huge fan of 80s synthesizer pop, but I still enjoy The Invisible Touch, due to the way Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford actually make synth-pop intelligent and engaging. But anyway, my point is that for the longest time, I never knew there was this other side to Genesis that reared its head between 1967 and 1975, a side that established the band as masters of progressive rock, and would serve as an inspiration to numerous bands in the late 70s and 80s. <br /> <br />This was the first album I bought from the \\"Peter Gabriel era,\\" and at first it confused me. But now, after listening to it several times (as well as buying both 1971's Nursery Cryme and 1972's Foxtrot), I look upon it as an album worthy of standing alongside such progressive masterworks as Yes's Fragile, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and Rush's 2112. <br /> <br />Although there are moments of brilliance on both Nursery Cryme and Foxtrot, I feel that the two albums suffered from bad production. The musicianship of the band members is excellent, but the production is only sub-par, which ultimately means that the two albums are not as good as they could be. Selling England by the Pound solves this problem. The band finally found a competant producer in John Burns (and the fact that band members themselves co-produced probably also counts for something). The sound is crisp, and not a single track is over or underscored when it shouldn't be. The four epic pieces on this album transition better than epic songs written by the band in the past, making for a downright entertaining experience for the listener. And the fact that every member of the group is in top form helps, as well. <br /> <br />Dancing With the Moonlit Knight is a beautiful opening track, starting simply with Peter Gabriel's vocals. Right off the bat, we can see that Peter Gabriel has matured in his penchant for role-playing. He shifts from the \\"uniform\\" to the \\"queen\\" to the \\"paperboy\\" without sounding like he's fumbling, while the hauntingly bardic melody of Steve Hackett's guitar slowly fades up underneath it. As the tale continues, we hear Phil Collins's drums begin to fade up as well, and then suddenly, in a rush, we are overwhelmed by the mellotron of Tony Banks, the explosive percussion of Collins, and the sudden shift in Gabriel's vocals from soft and low to edgy and raucous. The song moves through several phases, first allowing Hackett to display his expertise, and then the sudden bursts on the keyboard from Banks. But the transitions in the song or neither ugly or noticable, as on earlier epic songs such as The Musical Box. Finally, the last two minutes of the song are like the musical equivalent of a good wine: it must be listened to with the volume up to capture all the subtleties. We have the fanciful melody being played on the keyboard (underscored by what I think might be a 12-string from Hackett), while Gabriel's flute rises and falls and we hear the occasional jingle of low-key cymbals from Collins. It's absolutely gorgeous. <br /> <br />Moving right along, we have the shorter I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe), one of the few Gabriel-era songs to make it onto 1999's compilation album, Turn It On Again. Honestly, I wish this was one Genesis song the radio played more. It's easy to listen to, and it also provides a wonderful gateway into the band's more progressive period. The tale that accompanies the song is easy to relate to, and is really just a colorful way of saying that ignorance is bliss. Here, we have Gabriel assuming the role of a simple lawnmower named Jacob, who is content with his job and his place in life and just wishes that all the supporting characters would leave him alone (\\"I know what I like and I like what I know\\"). Gabriel's switching from character to character is more sudden than in the last song, but he still holds his breath well enough, especially during the long-winded second verse. It's catchy, but it's also got a higher degree of musicianship than the band's later singles (especially during the last half). <br /> <br />Firth of Fifth is simply a masterpiece, and probably as close as the band ever comes to channeling Yes (in fact, Tony Banks on the piano reminds of Rick Wakeman's work on Fragile). Each musician is in excellent form: the grand, sweeping poetry of Gabriel's lyrics, the almost-classical tone to Banks's keyboards, the soft but striking notes of Rutherford's bass, the crispness of Hackett's guitar (not to mention the way he makes it twist and bend like a leaf caught in a windstorm), and some of the best drumming Collins has ever done in his life. And I love the way it starts and ends with that classical piano melody. <br /> <br />I often find myself comparing More Fool Me to the song For Absent Friends: a short acoustic number to provide a rest in-between the prog epics. But here, I would have to say that Phil Collins, in his lead vocals, attains a contemplative softness rarely heard in his career, and I love the way Peter Gabriel graciously assumes the role of backing vocalist, underscoring Phil perfectly. <br /> <br />Then we come to the last half of the album. The Battle of Epping Forest is just about everything you would expect from a progressive epic. But here, the band reaches new levels of achievement. I enjoy how unlike past epics, we are not immediately thrown into Peter Gabriel's vocals, but rather we start with a militaristic tune (Phil Collins rolls out like an army drummer boy, while Gabriel accompanies on the flute) that slowly fades in and then out. This sets the stage wonderfully for what's to come. This is one of those songs that demands a great deal of attention from the listener. From a musical standpoint, one could enjoy this while working or driving the car, but it's also ideal for sittingat home, where one can read the lyrics as the tale unfolds. First of all, the band achieves a level of cynical humor here. The lyrics are inspired by an actual news article, involving rival London gangs fighting over East-End protection rights. There is a certain irony here, especially in lines like \\"these Christian solders fight to protect the poor\\" (anyone who knows anything about protection rackets knows that store owners pay gangs to protect their stores from the gangs themselves) and \\"the shops that need aid are those that haven't paid,\\" as well as a tragic humor in the way the violence is intended to be civilized (\\"there's no guns in this gentlemen's bout\\"). Especially interesting is the way the band seems to divert right before the final battle into a side-story involving the church, and one of the gang leaders (Bob the Nob). Is the band speaking of the hypocrisy that's always been present within the leaders of the church, or is it trying to heighten the metaphor that this gang-war is a modern day crusade, the gangs themselves like Knights Templars? Ultimately, that's up to the listener to decide. For some reason, this side-story involving the church is listed as being the lyrics to After the Ordeal in the CD Booklet, when the song is really an instrumental. I've always looked upon After the Ordeal as an epilogue to the violent gangfight we've just been witness to (mopping up the \\"morning goo,\\" as it were). In fact, I can almost picture it as music that might accompany the ending credits to a film. Very appropriate. <br /> <br />The album wraps up with two songs that fade into one another, something not seen on the rest of the album. The Cinema Show is an interesting story of the Greek myth of Tiresius, perhaps in a modern setting. It's a bit less edgy than the rest of the album, especially with the synthesizer solos, but I enjoy how Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford manage to keep the hectic rhythm of the drum and bass tracks going for the final six or sevenminutes of the song. Then, we leave with Aisle of Plenty, which almost seems a reprisal to the lyrics of the first song. But here, the overdubbing of Gabriel's lyrics (as well as the key with which he sings the lines such as \\"see the deadly nightshade grow\\"), always gives me goosebumps, especially when accompanied by the synthesized choir and Banks's eletric piano. It's short, but I think it serves as a fitting end to the album. <br /> <br />Much as I admire the band's accomplishments under the direction of Phil Collins, I would have to say that Peter Gabriel's Genesis is, in the end, more engaging. The band members were at their musical peak in Gabriel's time, and I only wish that more people knew about early-70s Genesis. Anyone who wants to know should start with this album. It is a spectacular accomplishment in the field of progressive rock, and hopefully will give a whole new meaning to the Genesis most people know.
0802130208|5.0|At some point in his masterpiece \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", writer John Kennedy Toole quotes Macaulay who says that \\"a great writer is the friend and benefactor of his readers\\". Having that in mind, Toole is such a great writer that he should be the best friend of his readers. It is virtually impossible to write about this novel without talking about its writers sad destiny. Toole never saw his work published, and like Walker Percy says in the famous introduction it is a pitty that its creator is not alive to see the success of his writing.<br /><br />\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" has one of the most important and memorable characters of North American literature. Flat and flatulent Ignatius J. Reilly in an unforgettable creation. So are his companions --like his mother, Officer Mancuso, Darlene, Santa Bataglia and Jones, to name a few.<br /><br />This book is the kind love-or-hate novel -- there is no in between. Either the reader starts laughing from page one and love it, or he/she finds it bore from the beginning and put it down. Those who embark on Toole's journey will be only pleased to find more laughs until the end of the book.<br /><br />Toole has a special awareness for dialogues. Much of the narrative moves through its characters lips. There are, of course, descriptions, digressions and all devices used in literature, but as a matter of fact, it is the dialogue that keeps the narrative going. And if the writer didn't have a special talent for it, the book would be a mess. The conversations are sharp, funny and witty.<br /><br />On the other pole are Ignatius's text from a book he's been writing. His texts can be at the same time funny, weird and tender. If at one point we think his ideas are far-fetched, we can't deny there is much truth behind many things he says. And he was living in the early sixties. Probably Ignatius wouldn't survive to the end of century, to the vulgarization of culture etc.<br /><br />With \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" we laugh of our own intellectual misery. This was the best advice he could have given us. Ignatius is weird, but there is a little of him inside of everyone, and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Toole suffered from the same malady that he uses in his epigraph from a Jonathan Swift's essay that goes like every time a true genius appears, dunces are all in confederacy against him. The prove that this writer was a genius is that he never got his book published -- indeed, dunces were trying to sabotage him.our own intellectual misery.

B000007MVM|5.0|According to legend the grave stone of King Arthur bears these words \\"The Once and Future King\\". These words could apply to Syd Barrett.  <br />For driving force of the original Pink Floyd whose arrangements and playful lyrics caused a revolution in music (as seen in the watershed album \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"), had at least one more swan song in his album \\"The Madcap Laughs\\". <br /> The genius was famous for his love of the drug LSD and his witty lyrics. <br /> <br />As to those witty quirky lyrics I give for example this excerpt for the song Bike off of Piper at the Gates of Dawn. <br /> <br />\\"I have a mouse and he hasn't got a house <br />I don't know what I call him Jerold <br />he's getting rather old but he's a good mouse\\" <br /> <br /> After a while, by most accounts, the band considered their leader, because of his continued drug use to be a liability, and was ousted by them. <br />   From that time on Pink Floyd's albums changed in style to a form of artrock although time and again the specter of Barrett appears in their music (most notably in the albums \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"The Wall\\"). <br />   But that was not the last we would here of Syd Barrett and this album \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" leaves one wondering why he was really ousted from the band as the album crackles with brilliance. The witty lyrics are still there and in some cases more mature and developed. The songs on it are sung with great poignancy.  <br />   My favorite song of the album is \\"Dark Globe\\" which is filled with lyrics great surrealistic imagery and sung with a beautiful desperation. The repeated lines in it \\"wouldn't you miss me, wouldn't you miss me at all?\\"   are indeed somewhat mysterious. Not to be overly analytical but are these words directed to his fans or his former band? <br />   Although he is helped out by some of his former Pink Floyd band members on this album it excellence seems to beg the question again as to what the complete details were of Barrets departure from Floyd as is competence as a musician and lyricist are still quite evident. Was he really by that time out of his gourd or was he the victim of a palace coup? <br />   This album was followed by the less impressive but still excellent \\"Barrett\\" (otherwise known as \\"the bug album\\"). <br />   Barrett has a great cult following. There are rumors of him being fat and balding and spending most of his time sitting alone surrounded by his collection of guitars. But like the legend of Arthur I hope for his return someday inspite of that event becoming increasingly unlikely as the years wear on. <br />    An incredible album that should be in the collection of every fan of modern music.
0316096199|5.0|Lucky is a story about a young freshman in college, Alice Sebold. Based on a true story, the book begins with Alice's first year in college when she is horrificly raped and her life immediately changes. Then the book travels through Alice's life and how people and herself have to adapt and change while soaking in the reality of her being raped. While Alice presses charges on her rapist, she wins the trial and her rapist is sent to jail. This is When Alice's friend is raped in her room after all the convctions and Alice's life takes another turn for the worse. She loses her friends, and becomes lonely. She becomes addicted to heroin and drinking and stuggles through her daily life. When she reads a book quoting her after her rape, she decides to change her life and begin to accept reality.  <br /> <br />I thought this was an amazing book of courage and bravery. I enjoyed the book a lot and would recommend it to any teenage girl to read. It shows a huge deal of understanding and courage and gives young girls an insite on just what can happen to anyone. I think that all youngs girls should read this book. It makes you think about reality and teaches on taking things for granted.
B00025ETIW|5.0|this is an excellent album, even if it is over-played on MTV. this is one of the very few albums i know of where you can actually feel the singer's emotion in each song. definately get this album.
B00030590I|4.0|...I'm not sure if I liked it enough to watch it again.<br /><br />\\"Hero\\" is a gorgeous film.  There is no doubt of that.  As the professional reviewer says, it is \\"sumptuous\\", but \\"sumptuous\\" can be a code word for overkill.  As my friend once said of Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"A good movie but a little too much singing.\\"<br /><br />The same can be said for \\"Hero\\".  It is a good movie but there is a little too much dancing.<br /><br />The premise is intriguing.  China is seven kingdoms.  One kingdom is on the verge of conquering the other six to make one country.  The King of that kingdom is always in danger of being assassinated and one assassination attempt in particular was nearly successful.<br /><br />The assassins have allegedly been vanquished by a nameless hero, a lowly prefect, who has come to tell his story to the king.<br /><br />The presentation is simple even though the story is complex.  The actors are talented and charismatic.  The martial arts fighting sequences were beautifully staged and that is part of the problem that I had with \\"Hero\\".<br /><br />There were too many staged fighting sequences.  I realize that the story is being told in a narrative style that is similar to a fable, but the actors (Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, and notably, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) are excellent and I would have loved to see more of their story and their acting with respect to their sacrifice and a little less \\"suspended with wires\\" martial arts.<br /><br />But then again, maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Even with the criticism above, I did not feel like I wasted two hours or my money when the credits started to roll.  That is always a plus and why I gave it four stars.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I can recommend the film to buy for the casual movie fan.  I can recommend it as a rental or to borrow to give it a try.<br /><br />And if you like it enough to buy it, then buy it.
B0007O38F8|1.0|It's hard to have any respect for rap music these days, and artists like 50 cent when all the singers main topics in songs seem to be are: money, and hoes. Oh yeah, like thats original. There are so many artists out there working their asses off these days by doing something called, writing their own lyrics, playing their own instruments, taking singing lessons...and most important of all....there actually in the music industry for the MUSIC...NOT the money! Not to mention music videos. Of course there going to be filled with half naked chicks dancing around, because sex sells as they say. But yanno, some people are actually looking for something called \\"creativity\\" and \\"art\\" when it comes to videos and music, which I hardly see any of these days. They arent stupid sell outs like so many musicians. I mean, can you really see yourself saying, wow, this guy deserves a grammy, naked girls in videos, singing about pimps and hoes, my god what talent! And if you dont believe me, try looking at the other reviews. Is it really any surpise why people diss this artist and others? People need to hear A LOT more from music besides shallow, cheesy, trendy lyrics. Some of us actually think about things more than sex and money. So please, try listening to some music with some REAL human emotion in it for once.
0790729628|5.0|Much has been made of the DVD version of this film, and it does leave a lot to be desired.  No extras, lousy sound, transfer that looks only marginally better than the tape etc.  But, get over it.  Someday we'll get a nice one, and as of right now you can get this version for next to nothing, so you won't loose much of anything in the long run.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' is just about the ultimate example of the cult film.  Much maligned on release both critically and popularly, it now has a massive cult following and is seen in a much better light from a critical standpoint. (Much like the also brilliant and innovative `The Thing' of the same year.)  Why it took so long to be appreciated I can't say, particualrly since a large part of its genius lies in the groundbreaking visuals, which while extremely impressive today, should have been completely astounding initially.  But, there's more to it then that, as the film has intriguing ideas, mostly courtesy of Phil Dick, and an stunning, compelling climax followed by a moving a truly denoumont.  Unquestionably one of my 10 favorite movies.<br /><br />Loosely based on the novel `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, `Blade Runner' is the story of Rick Deckard, a blade runner, meaning a policeman whose duty is to `retire' replicants, who are organic, artificially engineered androids used for slave labor.  He's retired, but is forced back into duty as there is a new case which no one else but him can handle: 4 replicants escaped from the colonies and have returned to earth, seemingly to infiltrate the Tyrell corporation.  (the company responsible for their production)  While searching for them, Deckard finds some important discoveries regarding replicants: First, that they have a mere 4 year lifespan, which explains why they've returned, and second, that they now sometimes implant memories into them so that they function better.  Thus, they don't know if they're replicant, thus anyone *could* be one.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' is, of course, the seminal `tech-noir' film, cleanly combining an over-populated, over-industrialized, dystopian future with characters and conventions of the noir film and hard-boiled detective novel, complete with a synthesized, future-sleaze soundtrack.  Deckard is a classic noir protagonist, reminiscent of Spade or Marlow.  Not actively malevolent, but far from conventionally moral and distinctly alone.  He's not an incredibly sympathetic character, but for the purposes of the film he needn't, and really shouldn't be.  Some have complained about Ford's acting, but I think he's pefectly fine, as is everyone else in the film.  The real standout is, of course, Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicant group, a powerful, charismatic adonis of man.  This is one of those performances where it is really difficult to conceive of anyone doing it better then he does.  This is a film of complex morals, as pretty much everyone is at least somewhat sympathetic, and no one is obviously right.  Yes, the replicants kill, but they are, for all intents and purposes, human.  Certainly, few would condemn humans for fighting in order to escape enslavement, and we could at least somewhat sympathize with their killing simply in the hopes of gaining more life, especially considering they've only lived for a few years, and have been enslaved for most of that time.  But, the real humans are sympathetic too, as the replicants kill both the wicked and the innocent, and Deckard himself is clearly back against the wall, as he is flatly, if vaguely threatened when he initially refuses the assignment.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' was and is a miracle of traditional special effects and set design.  I am not inherently opposed to CG, but I think that you should ALWAYS use conventional effects whenever they can do it well.  And here, Scott and company have made a world as complete and real and alive as any you'll ever see.  Visually, `Blade Runner' set the standardfor the futuristic dystopia, with endless urban sprawl, impossibly large building and the continous neon glow and flashing lights, mysterious explosions and the perpuetual twilight and rain.  Some modern audienes may be less impressed as they've seen other stuff like this, but they shouldn't be, because this is original, and it's still the best.<br /><br />The visual power of the film goes beyond the design and into the direction.  This is a very slow-moving, but truly poetic film, with beautiful shot composition and long periods of time with no dialogue.  Make no mistake, this is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination.  It's an arty film, no doubt about it, and a somewhat complex one, but not selfconciously or needlessly so.<br /><br />Though I don't dare go into specifics, the final confrontation between  Deckard and Roy is fantastic.  It's a truly eerie, otherwordly experience, with some truly fantastic lighting and set-design.  And, like I said before, I think the ending is very powerful.  Nowadays, the<br /><br />Director's Cut is the only version of the film readily available, and while most people feel strongly one way or the other, I don't care that much.  Yeah, the DC is better, but the changes are sufficiently minimal that it doesn't matter too much.  Yeah, the tacked on happy ending of the TC was lame, but I didn't think it really hurt it that much, and I don't really care too much for the idea that Deckard may be a replicant.  I saw the TC first, and didn't mind the voice overs at all, but seeing the DC made me realize that it's better without it.  The voice- overs kinda take away from the atmosphere and sorta poetic feel of the film, I think.  Still, the film would probably be pretty confusing without them if you didn't really know anything about the movie.  But, if you can get it all together, it definitely works better without them.<br /><br />As I say a lot, you just have to see it.  If you don't like it that much the first time I strongly urge you to watch it again, as sometimes it takes a while to really take it all in and get into it.  I also recommend Dick's original novel.

B00006879E|5.0|A lot of people on here don't seem to understand what Maroon 5 is. They are not trying to be some hardcore rock band, they are a pop-rock band. I love this CD, all of the songs are different and have an interesting story to tell, unlike all the pop music today that seems to be all \\"Oh my I want you baby!\\" All of their songs are beautiful...most contain sexual innuendos, but it's all good. I could listen to this CD over and over again. If you are looking for some hardcore rock stuff this CD probably isn't for you, but if you are looking for a pop-rock lighthearted CD with lovely vocals and beautiful sounds of guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard I suggest you give it a shot. And by the way, for those who say that Maroon 5 doesn't know what rock is, uhm well I suggest you get your facts straight...

B00079HZUM|5.0|This was a fantastic and whimsical movie. Like other reviewers have pointed out, it's historical accuracy isn't exactly perfect. However, I'm not an expert on the late 1600's, are you? I doubt that, unless you are, you're like to be bothered by these inaccuracies. <br /> <br />Claire Danes gave a wonderful performance. I haven't seen her act so well since Les Miserables. I would have chosen another actor instead of Crudup, because the chemistry between the two seemed a little lacking. However, this might actually have added to the realism of the whole plot... (because of the sexual ambiguity of Crudup's character). The two seem a bit awkward together at times, but then again, I suppose they're supposed to! <br /> <br />I'm not going to summarize this movie. If you want to know that badly you should just watch it. I will say it has a GORGEOUS soundtrack, with a folky, warm feel. The costumes and scene decoration (as if I even need to say it) were spectacular. And the art direction and cinematography were added a real fairy-tale quality to the whole thing. Whimsical is the word that keeps popping to mind. Some of the scenes and ideas were quite silly. <br /> <br />Overall it's a MUCH better movie than say, Shakespeare in Love. First of all, not so cheesy. Second of all, a lot more bawdy. Just go watch it!

B0000E1ALR|5.0|This vast, sprawling collection of Springsteen's best work only reinforces his status as one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all-time, a peer of Dylan, Drake, Cohen, and company.  These pretentious one-star reviews bemoaning his politics miss the point entirely, ignoring his wonderful, poetic, and (mostly) apolitical music to instead focus on what he does when he's not writing or performing.  You're supposed to be writing a MUSIC review, not some irrational, right-wing political screed.  Go home and listen to some senseless \\"American\\" drivel like Toby Keith or Darryl Worley; those guys between them don't have as much talent as Springsteen does in his right thumb.
B000002JS8|5.0|As an album to go out on, this is a top work. <br />At least 4 of the songs appear on THE FAMILY  JEWELS collection. <br />Bon Scott produced great work with what he had, and the band gave the fans what they wanted. <br />The Remastered version is a brilliant work, and brings out clearly the edge Bon had in live form. The Remastered version also has a brilliant extra with the booklet, explaining the role Mutt Lange had with the band, and How  eddie Kramer come close to working with this band. <br />No-one with any sort of rock sensibility will fail to enjoy this album. Its a brilliant work, and another piece that plays well at high volume. <br />The difference in the CD version can be easily heard on a 5.1  system, and you can play it with audible quality increase on most sound systems. The guitars rip through, and produce the most amazing feel you can know in an ACDC  product. <br />ENJOY. <br />
B00000255F|5.0|I give this classic 1975 set the slight nod over \\"Born In The USA,\\" \\"The River,\\" and \\"Nebraska\\" as The Boss' finest hour.  The lush, vivid poetry of \\"Thunder Road\\" always gives me the shivers (but in a good way!), while the heroic, majestic chords of the title track are among rock music's most hair-raising, heart-stopping moments.  Oh, and don't forget the epic \\"Jungleland,\\" one of the best, yet more obscure, songs Springsteen wrote--it has a wonderful sax part, some of his most elaborate lyrics, and a swirling multi-part structure.  As for Springsteen's politics, which seemed to have inspired some of the ludicrous one-star reviews below: whatever.  Springsteen is an advocate of questioning and keeping a lacerated eye on one's government, not blindly obeying whatever its right-wing nutcases spew forth.  He's much more \\"American,\\" not to mention talented and articulate, than any of his opponents or detractors.
B00079018K|4.0|(I'm not going to tell them about Primal Scream... I'm not going to tell them about Primal Scream... I'm not going to tell them about Primal Scream...)<br /><br />This is a review about Primal Scream.<br /><br />I love Primal Scream. Even their crappy record with the Confederate flag on the front. [I know the Black Crowes. The Black Crowes are good (figurative) friends of mine. Primal Scream, you are no Black Crowes.]<br /><br />I really like the way the Scream have changed through the years, from jangly C86 stalwarts to Stooges wannabes, into their most influential stage as psychedelic dance enthusiasts, through the decline into Southern fried crap, and especially into their rebirth as aggro-agit-dub-dance dirtbags. I love that their new records sound like they were assembled by pissed off robots built by the guys from Kraftwerk in collaboration with the guys from the MC5, all directed by Kevin Shields (The last part of which is kinda true. \\"Shoot Speed Kill Light\\" from the US version of Exterminator is the closest thing we'll get to a new My Bloody Valentine song in my lifetime...). But then they \\"keep it real\\" live - dirty, scary, and messier than hell, real honest-to-God rock music.<br /><br />Now polish all the edges off that. Then make sure you write at least one (preferably three) radio-ready hits. Done? Good. Now, you'll need a name. Why don't you call the band... Kasabian?<br /><br />That sounds like a slam; it's not. I like this record a lot. It gets frequent comparisons to \\"baggy\\" bands, especially Happy Mondays, and I guess Tom Meighan's vocals can take on that wasted-poet sound perfected by Shaun Ryder. There is an occasional lysergically dance-y vibe to it (most explicitly on \\"L.S.F.\\"), but I don't really see it in any meaningful way. The original baggy movement was like a new version of the Summer of Love fueled by ecstasy and lazy rhythms. The original Summer of Love ended with gang violence (Hell's Angels security guys, at least) at Altamont. Similarly, baggy wound down at its spiritual home in Manchester as violence related to the booming drug trade exposed the seamy underbelly of those good times. Kasabian reflects more darkness in their druggy dance vibes, reflecting the times and changing the feel of the music. This is definitely not \\"baggy.\\" Liz here at three imaginary headquarters mentioned Kula Shaker, which seems a lot closer to the mark. They were late comers to the party - post-baggy if you will - trying to keep dance music and rock music connected. And there was always something a bit contrived about them, as it feels like is the case with Kasabian. In both cases, that doesn't stop me from enjoying the music one bit at all.<br /><br />By now you've heard the ubiquitous \\"Clubb Foot.\\" That cut is the album highlight by far. I've heard it 1,000 times and I won't mind hearing it 1,000 more. Genius pop song.<br /><br />Read the full review here: [...]ltamont.

0790749815|5.0|NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the ultimate Hitchcock film. <br /> <br />The cropdusting sequence foreshadows 1963's bird attacks. The Mount Rushmore sequence reminds one of having VERTIGO while dangling from the Statue of Liberty. Romance a la NOTORIOUS. The train settings. R.O.T. = Bruno. Kaplan = Froy.  <br /> <br />The performances are all remarkable. The cinematography is bright and engaging. Bernard Herrmann's score is stunning and masterfully conducted. One of the ten greatest films ever made.
