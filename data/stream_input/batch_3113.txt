B00EVW0SA0|5.0|White House Down was great!  As a Die Hard fan I completely loved this movie!  Lots of action, a few chuckle moments, and a happy ending, what is not to love?  Who cares if it is believable or not, frankly most movies are completely unbelievable, its why we love them.  Most of us watch moves or read books to escape our daily ho hum lives, why would we want to watch something that could really happen?  Love this movie, the acting is good, not great, but good.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Suspending my disbelief (I live and work in the DC area), I found the movie very entertaining and would recommend it to anyone.
B005HSL626|5.0|MY grandson loves it on my kindle fire. It's a good baby sitter and don't forget the free. I played with him and I enjoyed it too
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Loved this book!!! Beware it will break your heart!<br />Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse,a  WWII story that will touch you to the core.
B00CHS31DG|2.0|Only two stars due to me not using the app at all.  I didn't read the directions either, so there's that.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|As long as you are patient and wait for stuff to recharge you don't have to pay to play this fun time waster. My boyfriend and I are hooked
B0058P7KUA|4.0|This was a good game for my five year old to beat.  Although it was fun for me too. This is a filler sentence.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|She's just so inspirational and breathtaking! She the cure to my musical sickeness and it's like I can relate to her music in so many ways
0061906220|5.0|My granddaughter and I love reading and singing this book together!!  It is a great time for bonding with children while teaching them colors and coping skills!!  Love Pete!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It's an addictive game wish there was more animation though other than that it is an extremely addictive game indeed
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|I could barley listen to this album. Maybe 4, or 5 decent songs on here. Production was decent and some flares of slim shady showed up. He tries to do a fast flow when that characteristically isn't him and his timing is off. I thought he showed of been done after relapse.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't want this book to ever end, it was just that beautiful.  The narrator was smart and funny in an ironic sort of way (which, given her situation, was the only way to be) and I just loved her honesty and utter lack of pretense.  Her interactions with her boyfriend were riveting and I was glad that she was with a boy who was so right for her and who loved her so much.  I can't write anything more without giving out spoilers so I will just say that reading this book is time well spent.
030758836X|4.0|This is not literature that's going to win the Man Booker Prize or anything and that kind of surprised me given the fact that EVERYONE raves about this book and calls it one of the best reads of the year. Well, that being said, it is definitely worth a read even if you are just wanting to know what the big deal is about. Let me qualify this statement by saying my job is really boring and I get tons of days off-- I faked being sick to my boss so I could stay home and finish this book. There.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|Was very very disappointed in this purchase.  Was a gift to my 3 year old and I had never seen it, started watching with her and not even 15 minutes into movie, it stopped and skipped and had lots of scratches, wasn't even able to finish watching it, totally stalled or got stuck at one point, I had to shut off.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I loved this one but don't expect it to be as dramatic is book one or two. I only gasped out-loud once while reading this one
B000QCS8TW|5.0|loved it, if you are a fan of the show you must read the book. The book will make you fall in love with the series all over again.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Well, I liked this one as it went into detail about the characters I like, but I found the storytelling to be a little redundant since they are not actually progressing in this book and we are just learning about the same things but from different perspectives.
B00FN811SY|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle HDX. I thought it would work. I will have to about getting another type of tablet.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I think this was the best book out of the series. These books are so unpredictable which is a surprise given the genre. If you liked the first book then read this one.
075666733X|5.0|This book has been a great guide to the body while studying for Massage Therapy School - they way it is divided into each region of the body is wonderful...
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Love it!! Can't stop watching best show on TV. Love all the twists and turns and the storyline doesn't disappoint.
0307474259|5.0|A succinct explanation of how refined carbs in our diet contribute to obesity, heart disease, and all other Syndrome X maladies.  Less detailed than ‘Good Calories Bad Calories’, but equally informative. Excellent for anyone who doesn't need all the details that were given in his other book.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Math skill needed but fun game non the less. stregic. Hope they make a second version. Because it would sell great.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is great.  I would especially like to take note of the tremendous acting of the child actor who played Chunk.  Comic genius.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kept me up late at night reading so I could find out what happened to the characters.  A good read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good read, ending was not what I expected and especially the 'what ifs' in the very end. Makes you think about your own life and 'what if'.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|It started out slow.  I almost stopped reading it, but I kept on.  I'm glad I did because the last third of the book was totally worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun puzzle game that keeps me addicted at all times. Even when I'm sick on a level FOREVER! I definitely recommend this game to any and all puzzle lovers.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LEVI!!!!<br />I loved this book!<br />It has inspired me to write something of my own, even though I most definitely suck!<br />But I love this book! It's one of those books that makes you fall in love with one of the male characters.<br />I just want a Levi of my own!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game, too.  For some reason my brain had a bit of an adjustment from playing on my computer to translating it to my Kindle Fire.  That's just me because the game is the same.  There are options, themes, game play, and hints.  A card game.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A little piece of magic typical of Gaiman. It isn't a long story but it still manages to draw you in and wrap you up and make you just a little bit sad that is has to end.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Love her CD. She has continued to wow us fans into something unique with a different sound. Her album is a Kaleidoscope of ideas. Thats what I love about her, her creativity. Give her CD a chance. She will surprise us very soon.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|pearl jam can do no wrong!  well maybe except not tour all the time!  come back to boston pretty please.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I HATE The new version. I don't see why you couldn't have asked for a trial offer instead of just changing. Now I can't get to my friends I saved in a folder. Place my old version back!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever! Everyone loves it- even the patients in the hospital where I work play it-Download it today-You won!t be disappointed
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I knew not to expect the same sleepless nights as I had reading the Shining when I was a kid. But this book did give me some willies all the same. Stars withheld for some kind of cheesy stuff at the end, but still a good read overall. I'd still rather read an average book by Mr. King than a structurally better one by most others. I just love his voice.
B004INHTK4|4.0|The book highlights the difference between the western style of parenting with eastern's. being brought up in Asia, I could really relate to her perspective though i sometimes I felt the negative words used to scold lulu might be a little too much but I agree that kids need to be disciplined from young for their own good and that required a tough tiger mom to do it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The over all game is amazing, but it is just too hard to get the newer people I suggest to LOWER the prices!!!!!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was great it is never the same adventure with her books<br />I can't wait to read outside of the divergent series
B000W91RUG|3.0|I really love this show hence the reason why I purchased it however, buyer beware of which seller you purchase from for there are many options.  I purchased mine for $17 dollars with free shipping from the selection of \\"New\\" dvds and upon recieving the dvd I noticed the dvds were not new (no manufacturer shrink wrap), there was a puncture on the cover along with a crack corresponding to the puncture, and although the discs seem to have minimal scratches three episodes refuse to play which leads me oo believe there's possible damage to the memory itself.  I can live with these minor inconveniences but it was upsetting to have recieved something that was advertised as \\"New\\" when in fact it was previously opened and damaged.
B00873GRU4|5.0|oh what a dilemma, what a choice to make. brilliant, sad, and wonderfully written hypotheses of what may come for all our futures. realistic, grounded and likeable characters. can we ever learn to live in peace, without deadly rules and regulations to keep poeple under control - here's hoping!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's fun, I just hate the fact that after you lose all your lives it makes you wait 30 min until you are allowed to play again unless you pay for more lives OR get some from your FB friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|fantastic find!  thanks to other's reviews i read this book and got hooked really quickly. its been a long time since i have read a book through the night because i just couldn't put it down! fascinating moral and human issues.  I am a bit of a gamer so really enjoyed the game scenes; i could imagine being there and hope one day someone will invent just such an arena - of course where people dont actually get hurt though! brilliantly written. have purchased and read the whole series since!
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Once again Amos has released a CD full of beautiful music from the first to the last track!  I have never been disappointed with anything Amos has released.  He is an amazing artist!  I would recommend this CD to anyone even if they are not familiar with any of his work.  He has a song to suit any mood.  I love, love, love this CD!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome game, love it!!! It took awhile to download but it was so worth it. If u like fighting games get this one.
1781162646|5.0|I am a hardcore Stephen King fan.  While I don't think this is the best work he has done, it was still an enjoyable read.  I live very near to a couple of towns mentioned in the book and so I got a kick out of seeing them in print, particularly Maxton, NC which is really just a little hole in the wall town.  I would totally recommend this book to anyone!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this app. My phone got different mining once I got it. Timer will allow you to listen while doing singing else on the phone. Definitely worth every.penny.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Headlines try to tell us the opposite of what is so clearly factual in this book.  Our bodies are designed to run on healthy fats and protein.  Read it and turn back to what is natural.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love candy crush I just hate the buy new episode part. If no one wants to help me I have to pay for move on. I just wish you could just go and go......
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Following the life of an intelligent, singular woman of science was engaging and well written. The author did a lot of research but the story never felt stuffy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish there were more levels.there was only one that had me stuck, Bt I for thru it! Enjoyed and looking forward to more!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|It kept me intertained the entire movie.  I normally don't watch these type of movies, but I am glad that I watched this one.
B003L45JLW|5.0|Great quality of sound and I received it in great condition and in a timely matter.  If you love Tom, you need to hear this!!!
B008133MDK|4.0|A friend recommended that I watch this and I am happy that I took her advice.  I have always liked the Sherlock Holmes stories, but was disappointed in the movies that came out.  So,...I was not expecting much from this series.  I was surprised.  No, it is not based on the original stories and it is a ittle &#34;odd&#34;, but I found myself looking forward to the next episode.  These episodes are fast; you cannot wonder out of the room and expect to keep up with the story.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I enjoyed the book and I think it is a good start at a conversation that is long overdue about the dearth of women in leadership roles. I didn't find this to be an essential read, but I found Sheryl Sandberg to be intelligent, very likable and I agreed with almost everything she talked about in the book. My thoughts were that this woman has achieved great things, she has been wildly successful; but what she has accomplished is not within reach of most women. Because of this, her voice is somewhat superficial. Not because she doesn't make sense, but because (as she accurately points out); her opportunities in almost every example stem from privilege. That she has successfully capitalized on these opportunities was a little luck, and a whole lot of hard work, intelligence, temperament and determination. But self awareness of the privilege that is represented does not erase it's concerns. My other issue is that a significant part of the book stemmed around balancing work and home life, specifically parenting. While a large percentage of working women are mothers, there is also a sizable percentage of working women who are not mothers. They deserve more than an occasional mention. This statically packed tome, doesn't mention the stats of what used to be called \\"dual income no kids\\" or DINKS, nor does it go into detail about single women (other than a stereotype about how they plot their careers based upon a spouse they haven't met yet. I have no doubt that there are many women this, but examples of single women who don't think like this are absent). Ultimately, I applaud what Sandberg is doing and I have no reservations about recommending this book to my friends. No \\"aha\\" moments or keen insight, but a very good, short, and interesting read.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I've played a lot of these types of games over the years and I've come to realize that though they may seem like time-wasters, there is actually some strategy involved, and it is a great way to improve pattern recognition, quicken reflexes, and, frankly, for me, relax.  Combine your basic &quot;match 3&quot; with excellent HD graphics, a simple storyline, and a lot of different modes and options to vary play (tournament mode, free play, adventure, etc) and you have a really good game here.  It's not your basic &quot;bejeweled&quot; - there are goals for each level and various configurations, money to earn for power ups, and just more than I even cares to write about.  I was happy to pay to unlock the full game after the trial levels, and I am pretty stingy that way.  I haven't been disappointed yet. One of the best parts is that the symbols and game board configurations vary enough so that you don't see this game when you close your eyes at night! :-)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|When I found that Divergent was to be made a movie I picked up the book to see what all the fuss was about.  Instantly fell in love with the characters.  I loved the whole set up, Insurgent was good, not quite as gripping as Divergent but still it held my attention and captivated my imagination.  So I waited anxiously for Allegiant only to have my expectations dropped and shattered! At first I was enthralled, not what I expected but pleasantly surprised.  I was even brought to tears in the scene with Tris and Caleb when she decides to take his place.  But when it became clear she had truly killed Tris I was FURIOUS! How could she? I was beyond dismayed at what she did. After reading it I took to the blogs to see if I was the only one, what she had to say with what she had done and her reason was she had truly grown, finally understood what it meant to die therefore she was comfortable with allowing Tris to die.  I hope you read this Ms. Roth, there is a lot more to life than dying.  How about living? Tris had yet to learn to live and you never gave her that chance.  I as a writer understand sometimes the story takes you where you must but this? I am still flummoxed as to your decision.  I will NOT re-read any of these now, and I'm a woman who has read one book I have in my collection at least 10x's.  I will NOT go and watch the movies now because why bother? The beautiful story has no hope of a future.  I live in reality EVERY single day and I READ to escape reality so when a writer makes a decision of this magnitude I'll veto it any way imaginable.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Some levels are very difficult to move up with. Hard to make moves at times. Hard to earn bonus levels
1781162646|5.0|I haven't read all of Stephen King's books but I never read one I didn't like and Joyland is no exception.  This is a mystery set at an old fashioned amusement park with more ghosts than horror and a lot of suspense. If you borrow this book from the library it might be hiding on the paperback shelf.  After you read this book I would recommend [[ASIN:B000FC0P9E The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon: A Novel]] my favorite Stephen King book.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I finish books because I feel that I owe it to the author to get his/her complete message.  I had to quit half way through because I couldn't take any more do good, feel good confessional transparency.
B00DY76Z32|2.0|While the special effects were excellent the storyline was lacking.  I just couldn't feel any empathy for the characters even though the actors tried I'm sure.
006202406X|2.0|I LOVED the first book and even liked the second; they were great stories with good character development. But the third fell really flat. SPOILER...It felt a little forced and the characters just kind of....died, for no real apparent reason, unlike the first books. They just died and were forgotten. Four struggles with thinking he's broken, but you don't feel it. He quickly joins a rebellion, screws up, and Tris has a speedy struggle but, as expected, still loves him. Weak - yawn. Then Four goes back to Chicago to erase one of his parent's memories, but when he arrives he can't do it and instead gives his mom an ultimatum and she...just says yes. AND then his mom and dad meet for a truce and they all just so easily agree??? It's that easy!? Peace was so easily achieved with a simple and quick heart to heart? Lame! And yes, it sucked that Tris died and Four (and the rest of the readers) couldn't have his happen ending, but in the end, even if she lived, I would have still rated it a 2/3-star for all the other reasons. very disappointing. pretty dull. I had to read it just to finish out the trilogy, but felt pretty let down.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Love this movie! A winter favorite in our home, especially if you love trains like my son does. Fun for the whole family.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great series!  Great visuals and sounds!  Movie magic!<br /><br />Ironically, the first movie transferred to Blu-ray the best.  It's like seeing it for the first time.  My VHS copy can finally be retired.  The others weren't quite as crisp, but looked way better than a standard DVD transfer.  The extra discs included really cement this package as a great deal.  If you are really &#34;into&#34; movies and how they come to life, this is a perfect set for an Alien fan.  I've seen these movies dozens of times each and they never get old.  It's fun to get a peek behind the curtain and see how these movies were made.  There were two versions of each of the four movies, theatrical release and a director's cut.  Now, I need the Predator and Alien Vs Predator companion packs!
B000Q76K24|2.0|Well acted and interesting but veeerrrrrrrryyyyyyy slow.  Definitely needed to be a half hour shorter.  I guess Matt was supposed to have aged a lot but he really didn't look like it to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Bought this game for my 4 year old and she loves it, she plays mostly on the hard level, I feel its a great learning tool.....
0385537131|4.0|Not quite as good as \\"A Time To Kill,\\" but a nice sequel to that novel, with Jake Brigance and co. three years later dealing with another highly controversial trial. Also, if totally accurate, an interesting insight into legal proceedings as well as will and testament law. Thank you once again, Mr. Grisham, for an entertaining read.
0307120007|5.0|I used to love this book as a child and now that I've got a niece on the way I wanted her to have something special that I'd loved.  It looked, felt, and smelled just like I remembered.
1250030951|4.0|An excellent coming of age story, FANGIRL is exceptionally humorous, touching, and entertaining. This book has everything you could ever want in a story. Rowell perfectly shows the enthusiasm involved with fandoms, the awkardness involved when close friends (or sisters, in this case) start to drift apart, and the joy a few good friends can bring to your life. Cath is an utterly endearing protagonist - she's very introverted, smart, talented, and has a good heart. She's not quite like other YA heroines, and she really stands out in her own right. Regarding the writing style, I usually dislike contemporary novels written in 3rd person because I feel that POV is better suited to fantasy novels. But, Rowell proved me wrong by crafting an excellent contemporary 3rd person POV novel that does not lose any connection with the protagonist. The dialogue is sharp, realistic, and memorable. The characters differentiate themselves from one another with ease. The story, while slow to move, is engaging from the first page to the last. I was not sure what to expect from this story but I was not expecting this. FANGIRL made a fan out of me, and I'd highly recommend this story to anyone who is even the slightest bit curious about it.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Easy to relate to, especially you are naturally a bookish / writerly introvert like Cath. The characters are honest, and utterly imperfectly perfect (I especially adore Levi). The story is set in college, which is always refreshing. This book is being pushed as YA, but it's the perfect example of what the New Adult genre should be. Dialogue! Dialogue is what makes this story shine.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: The excerpts from Simon Snow stories / fandom, while interesting, do become a bit much to deal with.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Deer Hunter plays very acurate and playable. It has good controls. As far as the guns go it has 4 types. Pistols, rifles, assault rifles, and shotguns.Over all it is great for a free game.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This album is so much fun! Almost her best. Actually it is her best! It's so bold it's revolutionary!This album may change the sound of pop music forever. The nuances of her powerful vocal ability reflect strongly in each song. She still sounds like a screeching angry 18 year old, but in a good way. She is truly and artsy artist. Rebellion meets fine art innovation. People with open minds will get this album, it's above average, even above great pop classics like Madonna. The production is also done well, musically speaking, the textures are expansive/experimental/innovative. Some songs have a metal or dance techno edge to them. Not much sounds like it, very unique in nature. Closed minded fans of old may not get this album, a bit has changed, maybe indie intellectual listeners will \\"get\\" this album. Just don't expect the same and you're in for a good fun rockin' ride!<br /><br />A true artist grows and changes, if we as fans can't nurture that, nothing new will ever come about.<br /><br />True open hearted Long time fans will not be disappointed! If you love new artsy pop this is for you, just preview the songs and judge for yourself! Buy it now!<br /><br />Too bad the new lady gaga album will overshadow this album. Avril actually is more artsy than lady gaga's \\"art pop\\".Avril needs/deserves more attention/popularity.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I beat the first under ground their and I am waiting for some gold so that I can advance. I like it tho b/c it gives practice before hard competition.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Don't listen to all the 5 star review, they're written by people who work under gaga's record company<br /><br />This is more like Madongaga (Madonna and gaga mashed together) or what the album sounds like.The personality, the clothing, the presentation, the album covers: all that stuff of Lady Gaga is very artsy, strange, almost avante garde. But her music is still very much predictable/cliche mainstream made to sell pop that isn't very artsy, innovative or experimental. The masses need to demand more than crxx like this that sells like hot cakes.She still falls into the same category as Katy Perry, Pink, Avril Lavign, Madonna and more. The music is still made to sell to the most shallow music minded audience. Not that her music is bad it's somewhat fun but not the best. The presentation and album title is misleading. This music is made for shallow flamboyant people who don't listen to much music other than radio pop and don't know what real art is.<br /><br />The new album itself is still just decent, forgettable like her last album. It's ok, not great, a few fun catchy dance tunes and that's it. Nothing super exciting, just a ton of gimmicky promotion lots will buy into. This is definitely not fine art.<br /><br />People wanting real art pop should listen to Bjork, M.I.A., Santogold, Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd, The Knife, janelle Monae, Yeezus by Kanye West and more.
0307346617|5.0|i loooved this book before brad pitt made it fashionable.  very different to the movie, you will enjoy it much more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting make sure your not busy any time soon. It is very hard to quit once you start playing.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|I'm collecting the whole Marvel series, and Ghost Rider is a part. Wasn't expecting brilliant plot or acting, and the movie met thise expectations.  Excellent technical effects, though.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I believe this is the Album of the Millennium. Definitely Album of 2013. Listening to it is a journey itself. Promises Art and Pop. A must buy!!! Lady Gaga has started a new era with ARTPOP!!
B00AGE4Q5U|4.0|Even though the story line to a degree is predictable, the actors make it work. It's refreshing to see a movie that's carried by the storyline, dialogues, and actors without any help from CGI and special effects.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Ageless great Rogers and Hammerstein music - a real classic. Excellent recording quality, very favorable price. Great to listen to on the road.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is delishly disturbing on about a dozen levels. The entire cast is fabulous, especially Jessica Lange. While you know the preise is far fetched, it still comes off as believable.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Similarity of small size Chinese symbols is too difficult to distinguish. I suppose someone knowing Chinese  and its writing might have no problem . For that reason alone I found this application not suitable for me and have since deleted it .
B00F9A903O|3.0|It's a good game to pass the time and fun to play. Only complaints: when collecting the crops next to one's that aren't ready, I ended up tapping the pay with money when I didn't want to, it's hard to plant on the crops if there is one next to it that isn't ready to harvest, my last complaint is that I am unable to purchase the lot the next plot of land even though I have enough money, purchased the correct animal, and tree.<br />Besides that, I enjoy playing the game.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|Most people probably think of the cute animated Mowgli from Disney when they think of The Jungle Book, but the story of Mowgli is just one-half of the book. These stories are nothing like the Disney version. This is actually a collection of many stories and songs--14 in all including: \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", \\"Hunting--Song of the Seeonee Pack\\", \\"Kaa's Hunting\\", \\"Road Sonf of the Bandar Log\\", \\"The White Seal\\", \\"Lukannon\\", \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\", \\"Darsee's Chaunt\\", \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\", \\"Shiv and the Grasshopper\\", \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\", and \\"Parade Song of the Camp Animals\\".<br /><br />It's important to note that Kipling wrote these stories for an audience, his six-year old daughter who died quite young.  They were probably meant to be read aloud, and perhaps as a bedtime story.  I imagine they would be better read out loud and much more fun.  The story of Mowgli almost gets lost in a silent read.  For today's young people, it might be considered an adventure story, but adults will see the racism and imperialism present during the time of Britain's rule of India.<br /><br />My favorite story, by far, was \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\".  This was one of my favorite childhood television animated specials, a no-frills cartoon that came on once per year and captured the playful personality of the mongoose and the suffocating evil of the cobra perfectly.  Rikki is equally delightful in print and it almost makes me want to have a mongoose of my own.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a fantastic book. It's a long read, with a lot of details (some of which I didn't find necessary, but that's just the style of the author) - but you really get involved in the character's lives. I laughed, I cried, I felt for the characters.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|Good CD of Paul's but he has had many more that have been better. The copy came with thack2 being scratched but once you get past that, the CD flowss well.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|What a twist to the original story, nice to see but don't get to devoted. after all it's not the original
B006LSZECO|3.0|I waited for weeks to read this novel and found it very disappointing.  Felt the story was difficult to follow and often the writing through me off in following this story.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app is totally awesome.  Nothing to set up.  It automatically found my HP printer and wha la, I had a photo that knew it was to be printed on photo paper.  Since I don't have a word program, I can't share that response, but photos are top rate...great app.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really enjoy practicing a different language on my own pace. It gives a daily reminder to practice. I am doing Spanish and French languages at the same time. I enjoy learning new things. I like their different methods of practice. Either you translate English to other language or vice versa.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's an okay game. I finally downloaded it after so many people talked about it, but I'm not very impressed. Just another game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that you added candy crush to the kindle!!! Its the best thing ever!!<br />What a wonderful type of enjoyment to add to my reading!
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|The action and special effects were great but the acting did not met expectations. The &#34;scientists&#34; really blew the movie for me.
1452111014|5.0|OK,I bought this art book for my friend,she likes it,so I think this book is good.And the book's quality is pretty well
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|great movie, lots of heart, Matt is Perfection. It was alot of fun. It made me happy to have Netflix. A surprise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Love love love this game. I can't believe it took me this long to finally play. Did I mention that I love it
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The Good: Awesome Graphics. Great controls and feel.<br />The Bad: A bit redundant. Not many levels.<br />The Disgusting: Can not complete game without spending real money. Which in itself isn't terrible until you factor in that it would cost well north of $100 real dollars to buy in game weapons. Most of which you'd only use during one or two hunts.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Get over it, folks.  It's impossible to adequately express how unbelievably overhyped this 'artist' and album are.  Based on the media frenzy she creates, Gaga's appeal presumably lies so much in her shock value, but when you divorce yourself from her ludicrous and exhaustingly tiresome image, the lyrics here are thoroughly BORING and uninspired, with run of the mill sexual crudities and vulgar imagery that add up to absolutely nothing.  Asking if she wants to be seen naked, tossing in formulaic come-ons and interchanging the ideas of 'love' and 'sex' in such a catastrophically muddled way as if there's just plain no difference between the two, anyone who thinks there's any depth here needs to go back to Robert K. Merton.  The disjointed free association nonsense of the cut-and-paste opening track \\"Aura\\" is absolutely pathetic.  The title track finds her seemingly suggesting that her music (which she laughably and pretentiously refers to as \\"artpop\\") could mean \\"anything\\"--a more accurate assessment would be to say that it means NOTHING.<br /><br />With attention deficit disorder running so rampant these days, I'm amazed at how anyone could stand to actually listen to this seemingly ENDLESS album from start to finish, as it takes the idea of tepid monotony to an extreme, and you're hard-pressed to even remember what song you're listening to after a while.  Musically, Gaga has seemingly pounded it into the public's mind that her cacophonous, clattery sound is hyper-modern and totally on the cutting edge--people need to go back and listen to Giorgio Moroder's [[ASIN:B00D3CA782 From Here To Eternity]], which came out in freakin' 1977 people, and STILL sounds otherworldly today, not to mention that Moroder understood how to work up an arresting, hypnotizing atmosphere, and didn't have to beam in the proverbial kitchen sink and flagrantly stupid, in-your-face lyrics in a desperate and vain attempt to hold the listener's attention.<br /><br />I didn't pay anything for this album, nor have I ever been a fan of Gaga's, and admittedly, I really never planned to review this, but I AM a fan of pop music in general, and I happened to hear this record and felt that writing this review was important, as I had some things to get off my chest about the Gaga phenomenon.  To be perfectly honest and fair, I can't deny that Lady Gaga does have very considerable talent.  She's no less than credible on the piano, and she's clearly a trained vocalist with a tremendous ear for vocal layering--these abilities do provide some ammunition for apologist fans trying to defend Gaga against her army of detractors.  \\"Venus\\" puts her vocal layering talent on full display and provides an undeniably ear-catching moment on the album, but naturally, even this gets ruined with the cliched sleazeball lyrics.<br /><br />I'm not as up to date with the pop music happenings of 2013 as I'd like to be.  However, I feel like I've discovered records that run the gamut.  On the great/really good side there has been David Becvar's remarkably inspired [[ASIN:B00DJWABIC Obsolete]], Paul McCartney's better-than-expected [[ASIN:B00EUS9JF0 New [Deluxe Edition]]], and Johanna Warren's captivating [[ASIN:B00G7HJHZY Fates]].  On the average side we've gotten Elton John's par-for-the-course \\"The Diving Board\\" and Sheryl Crow's uneven \\"Feels Like Home\\".  Below average, there's been Laura Marling's tedious \\"Once I Was An Eagle\\".  With \\"ARTPOP\\", I found an album to add firmly into the \\"dreadful\\" category.  This is a royal disaster of an album that sounds about as calculated and factory-made as it can get, aiming squarely at her already massive fan-base, and cashing in big time.  In a somehow predictable twist, Lady Gaga commented fairly recently that she doesn't care about money--you know, I kind of wish she DID, because then maybe she would just wander off, enjoy her $100+ million, and I wouldn't be stuck hearing about her in the news all the time.<br /><br />I'm inclined to say the whole album is wasted talent, but then again, considering the mass hysteria and money the album is generating, I suppose it's doing what it sets out to do.  But I recommend avoiding this record at all costs--it's the kind of album where you can feel your brain cells dying as you listen to it, and the annoyance factor is through the roof.  \\"ARTPOP\\" is probably one of these records too that helps give America such a terrible reputation to foreign countries.  Why DOES Lady Gaga have so many fans?  I only WISH I could give a rational explanation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this story! This is my second time reading it and it's even better the second time! Such a sweet story
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This album hits on all cylinders with only 1 or two tracks that don't really do it for me personally.  If you only buy one FFDP album, make it this one, though you'd be missing out on The Wrong Side Of Heaven and American Capitalist which are both strong solid albums and a few epic tracks from War Is the Answer.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Fun and interesting mix of possible real scenarios should the end of the world be thrust upon us. Definitely would recommend to anyone who enjoys this subject matter.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I fount this be an amazing, emotional action packed book. I highly recommend it for anyone with above average intelligence.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I only intended to read catching fire again because the movie is coming out soon, but the books are so good I had to keep going!!! Love love love these books!

B003O86FMW|3.0|Much of this book referenced the first book. But as the heros began to figure things out, this book took on a life of its own.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is the sequel of &#34;The shining&#34;, and is Stephen King in his best shape. I could not drop it until the end.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|This book was really a good read.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was a little disappointed in the ending.  It was a wonderful journey through the life of one woman.  Since I've always thought it would be fun to live someone else's life for awhile, this was the next best thing.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|With this app I can access my Amazon Mp3 music content from anywhere. I like being able to take my music with me wherever I go. It is very convenient. I think anyone that enjoys music would enjoy this app.

B008YKGQR4|5.0|With this app I can access my Facebook account from almost anywhere if my Kinddle is within range of a Wi-Fi signal. It is very convenient. I think many Facebook users would enjoy this app.
0142403873|5.0|I'm a speech therapist and use books to stimulate language development. I have used this book with children from ages 3-8 and all have loved it! One of the teachers at a school I work at was amazed at how the children were still talking about it months later. Such a cute book and love how clever the main character is!
B00F0N7JUG|4.0|Pacific Rim is awesome!!!<br />Love the movie! But I wish the case could be a little better. A little disappointed with the material used.
B00FQ272ZI|2.0|Wow. Why bother to go through all of this trouble and not get the script done right? A note to screenwriters: KNOW YOUR MATERIAL.<br />From a technical standpoint, Redford does almost everything wrong and the writer appears to know little about sailing. Watch as Redford floods his boat for no reason so he can retrieve his sea anchor! Watch as the impact with the container has nothing to do with the loss of his boat. Watch as Redford tries to radio for help with a coastal VHF radio with 25 mile range. Watch as he tries to hoist a storm sail (And it is actually NOT a storm sail!) after the storm has come. Watch as Redford's boat is dismasted, and the rig is attached with only one halyard! The list of hilarious bad plot points had me shaking my head for two hours. But let's forget that for a moment and remember that the average viewer probably doesn't KNOW how dumb this is. Let's look at the character arc. There is none. Redford's performance is not so much subtle as it is a one note affair. He's slow and methodical in his efforts to survive from the start, moving like a 90 year old man and not someone in their 70s. His performance rarely conveys worry or a sense of urgency and by the end of the film the viewer might wonder if All DESERVED to be Lost if only we actually new what &#34;all&#34; was in the first place.<br />This is a thin, poorly written adventure film that labors under the weight of it's good intentions and finally sinks under them.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|I love this series! Creepy, sexy, weird, fun, spooky and definitely entertaining. The characters are definitely not ordinary. You never know what will happen next.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Good information.  Book explains the technical aspects and exposes the myths.  A good book both for reference and entertainment.  I recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|Dr Alexander has written a wonderful book about his life/near death experience.<br />I bought this when it first came out and have given several to grieving friends.<br /><br />It is a must read, has been on NYT top sellers for about a year
B0019IB0II|4.0|Interesting look into a person's brain, and the author is in an unusual position of being a scientist, and able to really document the deterioration and recovery after a major stroke.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush finally came for the Kindle. I was so excited and now it's finally here! It's like totally addictive and I play it whenever I have the chance. It is a great game and I recommend it for whoever loves a good, challenging, greatly addictive game. If you decide to get it, I wish you good luck!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|What is the point of words? Words in the dictionary are just boring. All you are doing is just staring at definitions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very nice game. Colourful and also involves thinking. Once I started playing, could not resist to play next levels...I have been playing for hours and enjoy a lot
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! THIS GROUP IS AMAZING AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is some quality stuff right here. Usually you would have to put quite a dent in your wallet to get what this does. The sync feature is surprisingly accurate. The equalizer isn't the best, but there are filters for that if you're going to get serious.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As an avid Stephen King reader I always wantes to know what happened to Danny. This book gave it to me. The good, the bad and the ugly. Loved the book. I had to force myself to slow down and enjoy the read. I could have read it in one setting if I didn't have a job and a family!
B008J8KBKY|1.0|First, I could not set up a User name and password. After that, I could play but the graphics are very sparse. This game is 3D by definition only. I can't rotate the block to look down from the top, or up from the bottom. Rotation is left to right and slightly up/down. As far as signing in, there is a flaw with that, but I also think developers are going too far with trying to get everyone to participate, which in most cases leads to tracking. In my opinion, games should be designed with the thought that the Internet connection is only to be used for the initial download, and game updates.
030758836X|1.0|starts out ok, drags on, then for half a second there is the long awaited twist which gets the reader quasi excited, then it goes DOWNHILL from there. I think the author's use of profane language throughout the second part is an attempt to change the pace  which fails miserably. The second part drags on as well, makes no sense, then the worst  is the ending. I have to admit I was disturbed by how the author ended the book. I think she either forgot the stove on and hurried to end the book to get back to her cooking , or she is a bit of a psychopath ( i am leaning toward the latter), I cannot believe this book has over 14K reviews on Amazon!!
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|My fiance and I spend most of our weekends, chasing the flat track motorcycle races. I have to say, Bruce Brown hit the nail on the head, with this movie... it is truly my favorite movie, of all time.<br />  The way he captures the personalities beneath the helmets, and the span of emotions within the racing world, can not be matched.<br />  If you are debating whether or not to invest in this film (even if you are not a fan of motorcycles), do yourself a favor... GET IT! You will NOT be sorry.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|:-(  This CD is NOTHING like her past ones.  Very disappointed.  Not sure if it will get better the more I listen to it or not.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Love it. It is complete which was what I was after, but the presentation of the book online was excellent.
0345803507|5.0|This is the second and I like the story about a young girl and the rich dark man. How she helps him grow and he helps her. The sex stuff is not as bad as they say, they are well......good.....not nasty, tastefull. I'm waiting for the next book from amazon. I hop to get a kindel Paperwhite for Christmas.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great story line for the sequel to The Shining.  Stephen King never ceases to amaze me!  Exceeded my expectations for the sequel to The Shining!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's the best book if you've seen the hunger games it's just like the movie<br />Not appropriate for little kids 1-7
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|gaga was in detroit last night, and she SUCKED, the show was a mess, She was a mess, the show as to start at 7;30, she left all her fans sitting till 9;15. This cd sucks and she did 30 min of all the song that stink on this cd, she said she thought this cd was great, but its not not, it was not untill 35 min in the show we got what we wanted, the show and her were a mess.

I want my 80 dollars back for a show that was to start at 7;30 and you didnt get on stage till 9;20 and it sucked. Hope you can live with yourself. As for and artist. You have nothing to give but greed. get it while you can, I wont buy your cds, or go see you live. YOU BLOW. pop art is a bust. Also, Blondie, who have been doing music for 40 years, with there new cd ghost of a download is so much better then your cd. Debbie harry is 68, and I had seen them 2 times in the last year, where soooo much better than you. With what your putting out as music, do you think you will still have fans in 40 years. Put out another cd like POp art and , I dont think you will be around. as it stand, I am not a fan after seeing you live in Detroit, what a mess of a show, I wont go see you live, and i wont buy your cd till I see or read reviews, Your no madonna, your no debbie harry, they are icons. I am not so sure you are. Please prove me wrong. The cd was a mess and your live show. If you want my money and for me to be a fan, you have to show me you are what you are. sorry. not a fan. sorry.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This app is a huge scam.<br /><br />If you lose your lives, you have to wait at least 30 minutes to play again, pay to play, or go on facebook to beg for lives.<br />It tells you what moves to make but sometimes it will not let you make those moves, so you lose a lot. If you are new at this you get very little playing time.  Also, the clock runs in the background even when you close it out which eats up battery life.<br />Just as sad - Amazon has buried the bad reviews at the end of the 7,000 reviews.<br />Free and fun it's NOT.  Dumped this app in a hurry.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|You must use Chrome in order to &#34;Chrome Cast&#34;& it only works w/few selected apps such as YouTube. Is simple and super easy to use!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|great time waster... I wish there were more weapons and levels but the graphics are pretty good and the game play is well done
B004QX07G4|3.0|I really like Ellen. I enjoy her show so thought i would get her book. It is probably me, but there is a limit to how long I can enjoy her humor. Smaller doses are better.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|just... terrible! Would give less than 1* if possible but i cant. dont waste your time on this flight sim
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|good music good times good band.  It's been a long time since I've bough a cd. At the time it was a good buy.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Enjoyed the movie tremendously! I always did and will always love Barbara Streisand! Felt a wee bit close to home.
0307341550|5.0|A very good book with an unusual protagonist. As an avid reader of the genre, I believe the awards it won are surely justified.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this  game  although right before 0.8.0 came out, ALL of my data was wiped out. So beware, otherwise id id give it 20000000 stars.
0156027321|5.0|I cannot say how much I loved this book. An adventure and lesson in life not to be easily forgotten.
0316219266|3.0|Brad Stone's background is as a reporter for print media and my reaction is that the book reflects his experience as such and the writing style for print media.  Topics are touched upon but not in any significant detail.  Maybe the subject wasn't just that fascinating.  I have always admired Amazon for trying new things but these initiatives are briefly dealt with.  I would have been interested in understanding the motivations, strategy etc behind the decisions.  All in all a fast breezy ready, however, I left wanting to learn more and felt somewhat cheated because I felt there was a lot undiscovered and untold.
B00FFJPIJE|5.0|A great technical resource for the serious brewer - home or professional. Provides tremendous insight in hop chemistry, and history as well as getting the most out of them.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Game runs very slowly on Kindle Fire and makes touch screen mistakes.  It frequently switches to the &#34;auto view off&#34; setting and highlights items that are not close to the area touched.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book has everything - humor, romance, intrigue (how will it end for Lou and Will?) and just good script.  For me, it is one of those books I couldn't put down and yet I didn't want to end.  It is one of those books that stays with me, deep down inside, pushing me to decide what I would have done and what I would have felt.  The Epilogue is amazing.  I felt it in my heart and soul.  I don't know what to read next that will even compare to Me Before You.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have been enjoying this game a lot and wish it could go on forever! I want more like this.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I love it. Reminds me of playing MW shooting the enemy with the Gunner. If you enjoy that get it.
0316204366|5.0|I think this is Gladwell's best book.  I thought the chapters on inverted curves and diminishing returns was really fascinating.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This season was pretty scary and had a lot of dark humor in it, but it also had too much going on that never really tied together. I would have liked it to be more focused on one, two, or even just three plot-lines!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Classic western tale with the best cast ever assembled.  A must have for any western fan or fan of great acting.  Starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Angelica Houston, Ricky Schroeder, Danny Glover, Diane Lane and many more.  Shut up and buy this movie.
B002ZG994U|5.0|An exciting and funny movie with an amazing cast. This is one of those movies that we enjoy watching over and over again.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|An outstanding cast.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and many more.  Based loosely on the true story of the L.A. bank heist.  A must have.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Really great album! Might have been better if there was MORE but hey it's two more songs than volume 1 (and priced accordingly.) I know everything ever is now available on youtube for free, but I really want PTX to do more songs so take my money! Money is what makes more songs happen.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Great read. Love hearing the history, and no-holds-barred here.<br />Quick read, and always amazing to learn of the razor-sharp focus unwaveringly pointed toward shaping the future as he saw it..
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app works Great on my Kindle Fire HD... THANK YOU!  I can't take pic on my phone, so I downloaded this app....and I am so happy with it :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Retread the shining to prepare for this. Loved it!  It moved along well and really bought life to Danny. Try it!
6305428387|4.0|Good movie! The one and only huge drawback was the volume of the dialogues.<br />Everything else was LOUD, except the dialogues. We cranked up the volume when they talked and scurried to tune it down when the soundtrack / sound effects come on. It's still a good movie but could have been more enjoyable without the hassles.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was looking for a new game and I found Candy Crush, I was so happy, I love this game, I play it on my IPhone all the time.  Thank you amazon for putting Candy Crush Saga on Kindle fire.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I really enjoyed the game. I just wish there was update with more to do. Please give us a new area or more to do. It is getting boring doing the same thing over and over and not getting further along. I have finished everything and can not get more awards with out new areas to search. Giving this a 3 or4 star for this reason.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and so addictive<br />I like all the different levels and puzzles.<br />If you don't already have this game you should get it
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|It's one of those movies where you'll love or hate<br />But go in with low expectations and lower how much you anticipate<br />this movie.  All in all, it was entertaining and fun<br />and I'd rent it again when all is said and done<br /><br />Heard a lot of good and bad things about this movie so went in with low expectations, and because of that, the movie was a lot better than I thought.  As for pure entertainment value it was good and the plot was interesting.  I thought this was a ton better than the 2nd movie
B00DCX08MW|3.0|A lot more than a lot of these others game's that's all  pay a lot more for a lot less<br />Thank you
143353083X|4.0|Good size and it gives you one thing<br />that online access that is precious as bling<br />The book is an alright site, not too big and not too small<br />But it sure it thick, not wide not tall<br /><br />Good sized Bible, and since it's the printed version, it'll give you access to the online version.
B005IEGUDY|3.0|Lacks explaining the transition period between centuries.  Fails to show who the Celts were in England.  Doesn't go into enough depth explaining the Saxon, then Norman life in England as they live amongst the current societies.  Lacks maps depicting the actual geography of the areas discussed.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|I read this book for a class, and it ended up being my favorite in the whole book. Although at times all the complicated science and business terms need looking up, it's the characters that really draw you in, especially poor Emiko, an artificial human who only wants to be safe among her own kind. Your heart will go out to her, along with Kanya, the Environment Ministry official whose loyalties are tested as she is asked to do the unthinkable. She and Emiko are the real stars of this novel.<br />I hope they make a movie out of this book someday. I'd love to see it.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I really like this author and I think his books just get better and better. Harry Hole is such an interesting character I can't wait for the next novel in the series.
B000021Y7X|5.0|If you haven't seen this, then you must. If you don't own it, then you must buy it. AMAZING, SO ENTERTAINING
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|I am normally a fan of Sanderson's work but this book didn't do it for me. Unfortunately the foreshadowing is too blatant and doesn't leave much to the imagination. Almost nothing that happened was a surprise. The plot was just so predictable and hinted upon way too much for my taste.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|Simply put, I loved this movie from start to finish. Finally Hollywood got a Superman movie right. I highly recommend this movie to any Superman fan.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Okay I didn't get to see this in the theaters and I'm completely kicking myself in the butt that I didn't. I did however pick up this Blu Ray/DVD/Digital Download set from WallyWorld and I was able to get the SteelBook edition. Very nice presentation I must say, but lets get to the film. It's beautiful...gut wrenching...up lifting...and by far the best Superman movie to date, EVER. Now before all the Chris Reeves fans start burning \\"S\\" into my lawn...I'm not saying the original Superman movie was bad...it wasn't it was a masterpiece for it's time (and yes I saw it in the movie theaters as a wide eyed 9 year old)...but being true to the character this one is better hands down. So no flying around the world backwards to go back in time...BTW...if thats the case why didn't he just keep doing that and go back before Lex ever got the nukes in the first place?? Anyway...on to the MAN OF STEEL...The acting is incredible....Russell Crowe as Jor-El was amazing and Costner as Pa Kent...there is a scene with a tornado and without giving anything away it literally brought tears to my eyes. Henry Cavill plays the part of Superman/Clark with such conviction it never seems corny or cartoonish...and he truly makes you care about him and his story. Amy Adams is brilliant as Lois and plays the part as a leading lady not the damsel in distress who is in the need of being saved every 5 minutes. Although she does get saved a couple of times, but she comes off more as Superman's partner not his Achilles Heel. Michael Shannon as Zod was perfect...he pulls off the part threatening not only the father but the son with charisma and evil that bleeds into the screen. I'm a comic book nut and have been since I was 5...I've seen every hit and miss Hollywood has put out. To me this is one of the top 3 comic book movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a pure genius when it comes to comic book movies because his Watchmen film is my #2 out of those top 3 films. I think Warner should hand over the DC Stable to Zack and just let him run wild, because you can tell he loves these characters as much as we do. He grew up with them and that affection he feels comes through every minute of this film. I've read the reviews and heard the complaints and I honestly feel these people couldn't be watching the same film. I even saw the review where some one states the Supes and Zod battle can never compare to Superman II....Really? No honestly...do you remember the scene where Superman throws a cellophane \\"S\\" off his chest? That's high drama? Even as a kid when I saw that..I screamed it was a cheat...show me one comic where he threw Easter Basket cellophane at anyone. It was borderline stupid and insulting even to kids the film was aimed at. This Zod battle defines both characters...and was very well done. The destruction of the city and the size and scope are felt on all levels. This was an epic battle where only one could stand...and even the city lay victim. If you are on the fence...rent it buy it but do yourself a favor and at least see it. You won't feel like you wasted your time....you will be surprised how engrossed you become and the 2:20 run time will fly by faster then a speeding bullet. You'll find yourself wanting to watch it again and looking forward to the next time we see this Superman appear again. Thanks for your time. Take Care ~ Jasee to Zack and just let him run wild, because you can tell he loves these characters as much as we do. He grew up with them and that affection he feels comes through every minute of this film. I've read the reviews and heard the complaints and I honestly feel these people couldn't be watching the same film. I even saw the review where some one states the Supes and Zod battle can never compare to Superman II....Really? No honestly...do you remember the scene where Superman throws a cellophane \\"S\\" off his chest? That's high drama? Even as a kid when I saw that..I screamed it was a cheat...show me one comic where he threw Easter Basket cellophane at anyone. It was borderline stupid and insulting even to kids the film was aimed at. This Zod battle defines both characters...and was very well done.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this game.  It feeds my competitive side because it gives me the ability to let friends know when I score higher than they did on certain levels.
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie , especially the ending . But I must admit that I got a lil teary eyed when Rue died :( It's an amazing movie , and I'd most definitely watch it again and recommend it !
B003719G40|5.0|Excellent book. If you are wondering how to demonstrate your love to others in a more effective way, you need to read this book.  The author explains what causes some people to feel more loved when we do things that we normally would not do, even though they may not be able to express what makes them feel loved.  READ THIS BOOK!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|A cute and fun game.  Love the song.  Only problem is it has some problems on the kindle otherwise would be four stars.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is very addictive. Once you start playing you may find it difficult to stop. There's always another game to play. If you like number problems you will love this.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great family movie! Sit down with the kids and grandma and grandpa and enjoy.<br /><br />Make sure you have plenty of popcorn!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|easy to use. good reinforcement. painless way to learn a language.  Makes you use the vocabulary over and over in a visual way
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This game takes about 5 minutes to load on my kindle fire, then closes and returns me to my home page. I am unable to play the game.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I sent this product back as it didn't provide enough gain. Went with a sony mic instead. You get what you pay for.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put it down; what a great read. I don't believe that the film adaptation can do justice to this imaginary work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It could be better if you didn't have to pay for more lives or wait on your friends to give you more lives.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Most wonderful book This is an incredible story of truth, daring, thrills, and best of all suspense. Wonderful read, could not stop.
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|this is brilliantly written and Catton`s description of 19th century New Zealand is fascinating and educational.Her interweaving of the characters` stories marvelously come together at the books` end.  But, it takes a great deal of patience to get there.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I have this on my phone, and it is wonderful.  One time after an update, it did not work properly. I just uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it was fine.  HOWEVER,  though Amazon says it will work on my Android device, it did not download on my Kindle fire.  I look forward to when that day comes.  Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First book is great, second one is ok, and third one stinks.  Stop at the first book, it's the best one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Still learning the game and not up to the challenge yet, but loving the graphics and creativity of the game!  I will figure this out yet.  Recommended!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It keeps my attention without becoming too frustrating.  The symbols are easy to differentiate, but the positioning is challenging.. I play it a lot.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game to play. Helps pass the time when having to wait at Dr or anytime you are just sitting around bored
006202406X|5.0|I had read the first 2 books, and then again when I knew this third was on its way.  I have seen people complaining that they didn't like the ending, but for me, the last quarter of the book is what made the difference between a great read, and a great masterpiece.<br /><br />The story simply had to take us where it did.  So, if you are into summer romance novels, this isn't for you.  If you want to read a MAGNIFICENT trilogy, read Divergent, Insegent AND READ ALLEGIANT.<br /><br />My guess is that these irst books came out fairly close to when The Hunger Games were published, and this trio got pushed to the side due to advertising hype. (not that I didn't/don't love the Hunger trilogy)<br /><br />Again, this book is not for those looking for happily ever after.  Happily ever after books hardly ever make the list of Great American Novels.  This book, along with the 2 preceding, SHOULD be considered among the Greats.<br /><br />Brava, Ms Roth.  You wrote the book the way it had to be written, and didn't cave on the ending.  Brava!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is addictive and can be fun, I get to playing this game and hate to  stop and that is the downside, when the &#34;lives&#34; run out and have to wait a period of time to play or buy more time...maybe they should sell a version that allows continuous play.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Was nice to get back into listening to the old sounds today, this is a must have for those who would like to follow the music of the Beatles, a must have.
1469235943|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and the story plot and the ending had an interesting twist.  At times the story focused too much on the main character and her sharing her knowledge about dogs.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|***THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW SO BE WARNED***<br /><br />When they first chose Daniel Craig as the next Bond, I just couldn't see it.  But then, Sean Connery is the quintessential Bond as far as I'm concerned so there was a tough act to follow for all that came after him.  While I will agree with some that this movie felt different, I disagree that it wasn't a Bond movie.  This is the computer age so it made sense MI6 relies on computers more than gadgets.  There were a few, though, but not nearly as many as Bond used to get.<br /><br />One thing that does confuse me a bit - Moneypenny.  This movie made it seem like Bond and Moneypenny just met when she's been there all along.  Which makes me wonder where on the timeline do these Daniel Craig versions fall, anyway? I guess you just have to take it all at face value and not read too much into anything if you really want to enjoy this movie as it stands.<br /><br />By itself, I enjoyed this as an action movie that just happened to involve James Bond.  Maybe it's not a traditional Bond movie but that didn't detract from it for me.  This is my first Daniel Craig Bond, though.  I've seen enough to want to see the first two now when I didn't really care before.<br /><br />I did think the ending was inventive - bypassing the modern gadgets for (ok, I'll say it) McGyver-like substitutes.  I was sad to see that this would be the last film with Dame Judy Dench as M.  I've always liked her but I guess we all have to move on.  I do like Ralph Fiennes as the new M, though.  It'll be interesting see what they come up with for the next movie.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I will remember this book for a long time. I've read many books related to the Holocaust ... This is one of the best. Although it's appropriate for all ages, I think having some historical background will make the story better.
B00006GO99|5.0|Come on, it's Monk (RIP) - classic jazz - received order in a timely manner, packaging was safe, and the music has it original sound.
0920668372|5.0|this was the first book my son ever sat through. he usually got bored with books within the first 4 pages! Not this book! My son still asks me to read it to him and he is almost 9!
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|He's back I like this album my favorite has to be Survival. Only 1 skit and it's ok. Good but not great....
B006PKV2QU|4.0|Cute story.  I read it to my two year old twin granddaughters. They listened to the story and giggled, but did not like the pictures.  Not colorful enough.  But very well written. Will keep reading it to the girls and plan to share it with friends for their kids.. CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS BOOK.
0385508417|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, as I am a hard-core Grisham fan, but it was just too light and not meaty enough for what I expect from this author. I usually like his thought provoking takes on the legal system, but maybe this was just a miss from me. I read it in one day though!
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great Movie that was just as awesome as the first one. My son and I really enjoyed this movie. It's great fun for everyone.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This is a top book for all James Bond readers. Ian Fleming is the ultimate character. This book has a great twist. Get ready to be thrilled!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Plays a lot better with updates.  Movement of soldiers very good, would like to see prone firing position.  Graphics are outstanding.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Always a delightful movie.  Michael Keaton was amazing and the supporting cast, provided a full range of entertainment the whole family enjoyed.
B00AAQVSDW|4.0|Solid album by new country group.  The music is &#34;driving music&#34;, gets your toes tapping.  I would recommend this to others.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent movie.  The plot was good and the action was pretty much non-stop. There were some minor moments when the plot strayed or slow, but that did not distract from the overall movie experience.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|What a powerful book! I am learning a great deal on positive thinking and it actually gives you the power to realize negative thoughts, push them out of the way and go after what you really want by putting your wants and needs out into the universe!
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Good Movie Great Actors Plot was well written as will as the sets for the movie.<br />It is a Keeper
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite musicals from my early childhood. The Blu-Ray is sufficiently superior, in every way, to the old DVD (that is now a Frisbee, basically) to warrant its purchase. And of course, this being a musical of the 1st order, the improved sound also is especially welcome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm totally addicted. It's especially fun when I play against my Facebook friends. Each level is new and refreshing. Never boring, often frustrating in a good way.
B00000IL26|5.0|Back in the mid-sixties, this was one of my first ventures in serious hard bop jazz.  Prior to this I had been enamored with piano and organ players such as Les McAnn, Jack McDuff and Jimmy Smith.  Somehow I heard a theme, on a TV add, (perhaps for some automobile?) It caught my ear many times, and I eventually found that it had been \\"borrowed\\" from the \\"Sidewinder\\" theme.  I quickly grabbed the album at a college bookstore, and my taste in music began to grow.  It's funny...I had another version of the \\"Sidewinder,\\" which was too hurried, and now this original seemed, for awhile, to drag just a bit.  Of course, this was the real thing, and a breezy, bluesy conversation.  What a joy?  The five cuts on this album are dynamite, and nothing slows these cats down.  My personal favorites are \\"Gary's Notebook\\" and \\"Boy, What A Night.\\"  \\"Notebook' is a beautiful piece in 3/4.  Lee's staccato infused solo is wonderful, and Joe is masterful on this one.  Barrie Harris has a reserved, restrained style which works perfectly with the rhythm section, and showcases the horns effectively.  \\"Boy, What a Night\\" gives everyone a chance to really open up.  Great stuff!  Cranshaw and Higgins are wonderful together, and keep the magic rolling throughout this terrific collection.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A grabbing read, just couldn't stop until finished reading. So sorry that there won't be more of this great saga.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. This is possibly one of the most fun Andorid games I've played, and I don't know why. There's just a good blend of everything. Music is great too. Awesome game.
B00ER23XNI|1.0|This review is NOT about the music itself, but of the quality of the vinyl pressing that it came on. I enjoy this album, however, this pressing is near unlistenable. The amount of distortion is horrendous. This is nearly all throughout the entire album and not just in the 'inner grooves'. One channel is louder than the other the entire time. This is not an issue of cartridge alignment, as I do not experience this with any other records. Nor is it an issue of static build-up or a dirty record. I cleaned this record multiple times and used an anti-static brush and an anti-static turntable mat and played this record through enough times to the point where all of the static that the record came with was dissipated.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking for a good vinyl press for this album, think twice before buying this. I've had very bad luck with mine in terms of sound quality. It's NOT warped at all. it's a beautiful, 180 gram black vinyl. However, the sound quality is abominable.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I would not have read this after reading the first one except that it was the choice of the book club I'm in.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Odd format wasn't much to my liking, though the story was well told. Could have been better with a more traditional technique rather than the diary entries.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With so many good books out there to read, I was disappointed my book club wanted to read this trilogy.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Finally, a book by someone who understands dogs...and likes them....and isn't swayed by swarmy researchers quoting expensive and worthless studies..no, this author actually lives with dogs (and other animals) and understands how wonderful they are and cites different examples of why we, humans, are so blessed as to have dogs in our lives...I really enjoyed this book...
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome , funny , and , cool.<br />It's awesome because you can do a two player mode.<br />It's funny because they think Sensei has swag.<br />And it's cool , well because it's just really EPIC!!!!!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I bought this to replace my wife's aging laptop -- turned out she never moved the machine, so why spend the extra for a hardened, compact computer? There was plenty of room to give her everything she needed. We configured her 'puter with no hard disk, but a solid state drive, and it is fast! Beautifully built box, clear instructions, and good help when I hit a little snag.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Watch out for levels 65, 98,125, &amp; 169 it will have u spending money on moves. I love the challenge!

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|pretty good game overall easy to play. it would be better if there was more then 5 energy. but very addicting
B009XI7RF6|1.0|Did not enjoy either did the kids. The controls were to hard to figure out.<br />Needs a walk through guide
B00E9A656K|5.0|This racing game has excellent graphics.  It's multiplayer makes it even better then it already is. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great multyplayer drag racing game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great way to go strait to my Yahoo mail and messenger. Works every time I open it and is always synced up!
B00DYVUBYM|5.0|This movie really has everything; there is good acting, music, and a story. Sofia Coppola always impresses me with her films and this is my favorite work from her. The Bling Ring starts with a collection of images similar to the teaser trailer; this really helps set the mood. Also, the story is told almost backwards, which also creates an interesting way to view the robbery sequences. Had Sofia Coppola decided to show the robberies without the arrest, the robberies would have only been glamorous; instead they are fun but you know, deep down inside, that something bad is going to happen. The whole movie is very light and funny, creating more of a parody of these teenagers. Although the film plays out like a parody, Emma Watson plays her role very seriously which makes her character, specifically, very realistic. There are scenes that are very silent and still; these scenes seem even slower because the robbery scenes are so fast. The point being, they are robbing houses for the thrill. I would suggest this movie to anyone but at the same time, if you do not like Sofia Coppola's other movies, you will also not like this one.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|Deleted this app after a few days of play. And I was totally bummed out :-( I grew up playing Sonic and was super excited to play this game. My problem with the game was the controls. I just couldn't play the game to the best of my ability with them. I will say it's a beautifully well done.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I have been waiting for ARTPOP since I knew it was coming out. I always get nervous when Lady Gaga releases a single, because I never really love the songs. Applause sounded a little generic but that is NOT what the CD is like. Lady Gaga touches upon many genres so every single song sticks out; no song sounds like another one. Here's a breakdown of each song:  1. Aura - (4.5/5) A really catchy, different song.  2. Venus - (5/5) Venus has a great chorus  3. G.U.Y - (4.5/5) It is a good song, but it is a little cheesy  4. Sexxx Dreams - (5/5) Probably my favorite song on the album  5. Jewels N' Drugs - (3.5/5) Probably my least favorite song. I'm sure it  will grow on me though.  6. Manicure - (4.5/5) Again, this is very different from normal pop music.  7. Do What U Want - (5/5) Incredibly catchy  8. ARTPOP - (5/5) Another one of my favorites. It sounds very trippy.  9. Swine - (4.5/5) A great song that encompasses several types of music.  10. Donatella - (4/5) I do like it but it sounds slightly normal.  11. Fashion! - (4/5) This is classic and it is definitely going to be used in a movie someday.  12. Mary Jane Holland - (5/5) This song sounds a lot like Bloody Mary, which is a really good thing.  13. Dope - (5/5) Another really good song. I love Lady Gaga's piano-based songs.  14. Gypsy - (4/5) Very catchy and fun.  15. Applause- (4/5)A little generic but good nonetheless.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Pretty nice was smooth yo . I loved the story and the action of the book in conclusion I could not let go.
0425263924|5.0|Read first 2 books, had to read the final book! Worth the read! Great unexpected twist. When are more coming out??
6305910340|5.0|Great story by great actors. Really brought home the idea of looking at the same thing and seeing it in different ways; be it a parent's view of their child, a friend's view of that same child, and the child's own view of himself and the place chess has in all their lives.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Adorable doll. My daughter LOVED it! She liked all the glitz and glam the doll offered. Plays with it all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun and addictive like everyone says, but it gets annoying when you run out of lives and either have to wait for more, ask FB friends for some, or (of course) buy some. All in all it's a fun little game that is a great time killer.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I had already bought the song \\"Guiding Light\\" last year and I was very impressed. When I bought and listened to the whole CD I couldn't believe my ears. EWF had made a brilliant album without the great vocals of Maurice White. Philip Bailey more than holds his own on this recording and the album has a little bit of many different genres which compliments EWF's style completely. Anyone who is a fan and doesn't have this needs to hurry up and get on the bandwagon.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|We had buffering issues from Amazon. A couple of times during the playback the movie had to buffer. We never saw the actual ending of the movie because it simply stopped.
0385537131|5.0|Another wonderful story!<br /><br />But it seems like there should be more  -<br />Now we want to know about Lettie's new house?<br />And how is Portia doing in law school?<br />And how do the Brigance's like their new/old house?<br />How are Jake's finances?<br />This story is still not finished!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hey, it is a great flick with totally high end FX! A total re-watcher when the mood strikes and best of all it was FREE with my Amazon Prime acct!
0385335989|5.0|The Outlander Series are at the top of my list of favorites. I've read them all twice so far and plan on reading them all again when Diana Gabaldon comes out with her newest Hearts Blood book in 2014. Ms. Gabaldon really knows how to write a page turner historical novel.

0312370849|5.0|Loved this story!  At first I was confused because there were 2 stories going on at the same time.  Once I figured that out, it was really good.  Finished it on a flight, and gave it to the lady next to me with high praise.
B00FZ9XGH0|2.0|The album is by far the weakest. If she wanted a change in pace, this is the wrong move. The music is strident, the lyrics are idiotic at times. How do you go from heartfelt &#34;meine welt&#34; to the breathtakingly moronic &#34;te quiero?&#34;.  Helene should be more selective if she wants to be taken seriously.
B00AC8ZA3M|3.0|Very good and entertaining, was new approach to the plot. Good on all levels, writing, direction, acting, location and special effects. I will recommend this as a good movie.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever.  I have been waiting to be able to steam this movie from Amazon or Vudu.  I give it 5 no matter what anyone says.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is the best way to pass time.plus you can choose what kind of game skit your having a bad day you canply winning hands if you want.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|My 7 year old pal loved this movie (and I liked it too). She says to give it 5*. It's a cute departure from the regular series.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Excellent music from excellent musicians.  Glad they keep coming out with music from their archives.  Thanks to Yoko, Ringo, Paul and Cynthia.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Percy Jackson is the son of a god, he is brave and daring, and he must save the world. Percy Jackson The Lightning Thief is an amazing novel, which mixes the Greek beliefs and Mythology with the modern world in an intense action packed book.<br /><br />Rick Riordan is a great writer who has the great ability to mix fantasy with facts and history. In this book, everything flows fantastically, he makes the Greek monsters and heroes seem believable, like they could actually be there. Well developed character range from the main person, Percy, to the Traitor, Luke, who you could always tell had a little bit of a dark side from the writing.<br /> One of my favorite things about this book is how much action there is. You're constantly on the edge of your seat at every turn. As the clock counts down to  the solstice when Percy must have the lightning bolt, Percy must give everything to find Zeus's lightning bolt. This is my favorite part of the book because of how action packed it is.<br /> What's the age limit for these books? I'd say there isn't much of one, I mean you have to be able to read decently, but its not very bloody so I'd say any age from 10 and up. Does Rick Riordan pack too much action and info into this book? Definitely not, there is plenty of that to go around, but I believe that this book has the perfect amount of action, history, and knowledge.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Exquisitely written in both a factual and fanciful sense. With an extreme attention to fact and detail, the author pulls everything into a full captivating circle that is Life of Pi. Though not for the weak hearted, nor for the weak minded. Every word being a different symbol the the number that is Pi.<br />Excuse me while I go back an  read it again~
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is absolutely the most important movie I have ever watched.  Every American needs to watch this and demand change.  It was extremely well-done and eye-opening.  We cannot keep our heads in the sand anymore about what is done to our food.  Pretty alarming.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|A lot of time wasted in the movie where absolutely nothing happens. The end is the best part and it only lasts a few seconds. Poorly written! It really had potential.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Excellent series for a tv show I plan on watching the rest ot the series when I get time. Amen
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sometimes I get a little weary of the southern slowness of Grisham books, but this one was perfect.  It was great to hear \\"the rest of the story\\" of Jake Brigance and the rest of the characters from 'A Time To Kill'.  The story itself was an intertwining of modern life and not so ancient history that kept me hooked.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|If you need a USB hub, it's a great size and charges my stuff fast. Don't know what more you could ask for.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|This is a good father/son movie. I enjoyed Will and Jaden Smith working together. As a young boy grows to be a man, he will rely on his father's guidance to help him navigate through the challenges of life.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played a lot of solitaire games on my kindle and this one is by far the best. Lots of game options and good graphics make this my go to for a quick round of solitaire.
B002OKGJUO|4.0|3.5 stars. it is a great classic. Yet, in todays modern high tech special affect world, it is outdated! So, if you are looking for real life action rent the modern version with Gary Oldman and Kianu Reeves.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Terrible movie . Story concept was creative but poor. Visual effects= thank god for computers. Idris Elba really strained to act the part.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|This is, quite literally, the worst movie I have ever seen. There was very little paranmormal activity or special effects. What a waste of two hours. I kept hoping it would start to pick up toward the end like the others did. Don't bother with this one.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game was OK but it did not last that long to get a good feel so I think it would be OK.  I would reccomend it seems to move very well and it had some good elements to it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Quite challenging with some good twists. You'll probably need a walkthrough (or infinite patience) at certain points. It's a little short, though.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Have no idea what this game is about Could not get anywhere checked all over and could not find anything that would help get out of the room and there are no directions I guess I am just not thinking right .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun in short bursts. But it is much too repetitive to play for long. And, as with most games by King, you only get 5 lives and then you have wait a while to get more (unless you want to buy more lives). I get that it's their way of making money on the game. But I, like most people, am not going to pay money to play a &#34;free&#34; game. So it just becomes annoying.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played I highly recommend this game for real steel fans! Real Steel World Robot Boxing FTW!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a full of adventure and suspense and a little romance. The writing flowed and the characters were well developed.

1853262390|4.0|I wonder when writing these reviews if &#34;classic&#34; authors like Virginia Woolf need new reviews, and I think the merit of writing this lies in keeping the reading of the material current to our time and culture. With that motivation, in a world where gender roles have shifted far from those of Woolf's time, and where even gender identity is mutable, this novel's subject seems perhaps more appropriate now than the early 20th century.<br /><br />That it is so artfully and modernly written makes it a pleasure. Its meticulously fiddly telling and conversational tone make it feel like a mockumentary fairy tale, skating figure eights across the line between silly and serious, and always magical.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Well it was a present for my cousin, she loved it so much and now im officially her best cousin ever. About the CD she made me hear it, and it not bad at all, it has that dancing and addicting beat.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was a HUGE disappointment. I haven't looked forward to a book in such a long time, and Veronica Roth completely dropped the ball. Don't bother!!!!
B00G0KY1UO|4.0|Got this for my Nexus 7. Fun game, takes a little practice to get used to the controls. Some glitches here and there, but nothing too bad.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome game fun for hours or until you run out of powercores but still very very fun game to play
B002436WFI|5.0|I am a recent convert to Terry Pratchett so have only read a few of he's books but have seen all three TV movies. I think this is the best of the Terry Pratchett TV movies and the one I recommend to friends as an introduction to Disc World.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Alma is one of the most engaging fictional heroines ever! What a fabulous role-model for all women--how to live, how to die. This book is a classic. I couldn’t put it down. I was not a great fan of Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love. With this book, she has entered my very small list of Must Read Authors.
B000EQ5HSK|5.0|Has been a great asset to my photo collection. The velveted inside of the hood really works to protect from dust and dirt! This is far beyond the plastic competitors.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I downloaded this when it was the free app of the day some months ago and continue to waste a great deal of time playing it.  Well executed and fun.
0694003611|5.0|A classic story for bedtime.  Easy to read and children love hearing this story over and over again.  Helps children get mentally prepared to sleep.  This book is a calm and soothing book.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|The movie is enjoyable enough, but has no understanding of the customs or manners of the time period in which it is set.  The title character is far too modern an interpretation and her manners (and voice) frequently made me cringe.  Needless to say, the movie is not at all a faithful adaptation of the novel but, if you are looking for a light romance and do not mind lack of historical integrity, then the movie does well enough.
0805047905|5.0|This is a durable hard board book that is great for young children to help in learning colors and animals written in a fun way so they learn without knowing it.
B00138CYD4|4.0|Loved reconnecting with the old classics primarily. A few of the newer pieces don't have a vocal style I like all that much, but I get past that because of the masterful guitar work. And maybe the vocals will sound better with familiarity.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|My emotions have run a full marathon in this series and especially with this book. I have always loved Alex. She is a great heroine. She was loyal to friends, family, God's and duty. She was wonderfully flawed and always fought for the weak and less fortunate. How could you not respect that?! Aiden was incredibly strong and loyal as well. He believed in Alex and in their love. He fought the status quo and followers his heart. Seth was a little more of a challenge. He was cocky, arrogant and insufferable. But I had a hard time buying him as totally bad. The dichotomy that is Seth shows strong and bright in this book. I love and hate him at the same time. The gods were just how you would expect, unpredictable.<br />The plot of this book was the final journey to bring peace to Olympus and mankind, at a great cost. I laughed and cried a lot. Some happy tears but a lot of sad ones. I did not see the ending coming. I was blown away and reeling from the outcome. I was satisfied and still tearing up at the end. Great finish to a great series.  It's a sad/ happy day. I hate saying goodbye to great characters.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was awesome it had adventure, comedy, love, and so much more!! It's great for all ages and kid friendly. I had a great time reading this book and I hope you do to, I think you should get it! I don't want to spoil it for u but........... the ending was full of surprises!

B0074D3CAQ|1.0|Very bland and hard to stay connected to want to read further. I kept waiting for something pivotal to happen and gave up.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson. She is amazing & so talent. I think this album really gave her the ability to move up to the next level. She's had my support from day one. No matter what she does she'll always have my support.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|First off, I really like the idea for Iron man 3! I was looking forward to this villain! Come on, its the freaking Mandarin!<br /><br />I was looking forward to the idea of mad/genius scientist againts Toney Stark ideas. Battle of conflicks. Mandarin I'm talking about also have 10 power rings! That could come from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and placed on each finger!<br /><br />No What we got is a some poor sho, from the streets, drunk and partying with many booze and women... Boring! Well, not the women part!<br /><br />Movie ok just by itself, but I don't know about you. But I'm tried of movies productions killing off villains and list is very long! Only villain that I can think of that got away to bring back chaos is Cobra Commander in the GI JOE movie! Go fig? Two, Movie productions making the villains very lane lane lane lane lane... Could I say more. But wait there been a few villains that, with rewrite was brought out even better... Thats another story...<br /><br />Still, this is Iron man don't care if its the 1st 2nd or 3rd, Robert Downey, Jr, plays Tony very good. I give cridet where credit is due! Keep up the good work. Just wish that the villians from all your movies in Iron man was not so lane. Even though the actors play their parts very well. It was the story line that failed.<br /><br />No the blame has to go to the writers! And moive prduction dirctors! For there lack of in sight. There a diffient between a good movie and a great.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor & Park is an intelligent story that helps younger readers think about their choices in life. The novel challenges kids to confront the stereotypes they have about race, ethnicity, the weirdos, and the different kids they hardly know. As an adult reader, I am reminded of just what life was like in the 80s. It places the music of that era in a way kids might see their own musical idols today. Eleanor & Park is about love, between them, between parents and their children. It's also about the bad, like bullies, poverty, and creepy pseudo stepfathers. This is a novel about real issues with real language the way kids talk and think. The language in parts can be raw, and some situations may make the readers uncomfortable. It's not gratuitous. It's done for a reason. It's done to tell a story about a girl trapped in a terrible family life who finds love.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I have a 1st gen kindle and at first it would not load saying not enough memory.  I 'm glad they got that figured out. this game is awesome!
B001H1OUUC|5.0|My wife introduced me to Ray Lamontagne and I thank her very much for it.  Songs like Empty, Barfly and Can I Stay are beautiful and haunting, with breathy vocals that are perfect for quiet nights.  Highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|And I've tried many. I'm one of those \\"have 10-15 pounds to lose\\" types which can be very hard to overcome that last set of pounds. (I've lost 9 so far.) Now, it's not solely due to this video.... I drastically changed my eating habits to higher protein / lower glycemic carbs only. Not low carb but only good carbs that don't spike blood sugar. This is actually what Jillian and many others suggest and I've seen it work in my own weight loss. (I got one of her cookbooks and one of the Biggest Loser cookbooks to help). I started this video about 2 1/2 weeks after I began to exercise every day with a variety of videos. But this hard workout really makes you feel like you are making best use of your time. If you are pressed for time, do this video! I have an elliptical and the way I feel at the end of this video doesn't compare! It's so much harder and a much more efficient use of my time exercising.<br /><br />I'm on day 11 / level 2 now. (No, I did not do them 11 days in a row like some think she tells us to do.) I did about 2 in a row, then 1 day of something else like Yoga, then repeat, then day off to fill out the week.  I had already lost some weight before I started this video, but have lost more since and I've seen a huge improvement in inches lost around abs / waist, which was my biggest problem area, since I started this and lowered my body fat percentage. And my endurance has really improved.  But I haven't lost much in my legs and think Level 1 wasn't quite hard enough on legs but level 2 feels like it does more with legs.<br /><br />I did level 1 all 10 days. I gradually increased the weight where I could, normally using 5 or 8. I wish I had started with 3 b/c I was WAY sore after the first workout. But after that one, I had no trouble continuing each day.  (Anyone else think the first cycle of strength on level 1 is the hardest of them all? Yikes! It was still way hard on my 10th day!)<br /><br />The abs are a little too easy on Level 1 but improve on Level2. So you may want to plan a little extra exercise on your own if that is a trouble area.<br /><br />Just know though this is not 20 minutes. Plan for 30. Each video is about 27 ish minutes. I think she doesn't calculate the warm up or cool down when she says give her 20 minutes a day. But it's 20 minutes of the hard core stuff. Consider this video if you want to work hard in a short amount of time.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br />I just have one day left of 30 day shred. It took me about 7 weeks to get through it. Ave. about 4x per week on the shred video and 2 days doing something else.<br /><br />When I finished the 10 days of level 1 it still felt hard to me. But after mostly finishing level 3 when I took a lighter day to do 1 after a hike made my legs sore, level 1 was easy. It showed me how much better shape I am in cycling through the program. I've never experienced big results like this before with any other video or program.<br /><br />From the 2nd week of Oct til now (mid Dec.) I've lost most of the weight I set out to lose and a lot of that is body fat.<br /><br />I just have one suggestion on Level 3. The hardest move is when she wants you in a plank with weights under your hands to lift. But with all of your body weight on one hand at a time, it hurts too much b/c weights are too hard even with neoprene covers. I tried the same move without weights and still felt like my arms were getting a great workout (because they take turns holding a lot of your body weight.)<br /><br />My legs got much more muscular after getting into Level 2-3 and abs workouts are much better than 1. I had mentioned 1 wasn't enough on the legs or abs. That gets fixed with 2-3. I was able to do an extremely difficult hike up a mountain at the 2/3rds part of this program. I could never have done it without having gotten in shape through this video first. I've lost over 3\\" around my waist/abs area. And 13 pounds total loss.
B007SGM084|5.0|A trilogy you will never want to end. You feel the characters and laugh and cry  in such a wonderful way. I stayed home from work just to finish the last pages.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The life on times of British Royalty is always interesting.  This movie tells the story of Britain's King during World War II, George VI (played by Colin Firth).  \\"Bertie\\" as the King was known to his family was a conscientious member of the Royal Family who had a terrible stutter.  His speeches were a trial for himself and those listening.<br /><br />This movie tells how Bertie controls his stammering with the help of his speech therapist.  The interplay between the low-born Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and the king is heartwarming and entertaining.<br /><br />This is an inspiring movie that has two interesting story-telling ways.<br /><br />First:  The story focuses on Bertie overcoming his speech impediment, not anything else.  During the lead-up to the climactic scene, the various functionaries in the British Empire, the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and others all support the plot tension that the King must make the most important speech of his career-Great Britain's declaration of war against Germany.  As the king approaches the microphone, he doesn't get any re-assurances from Churchill that the RAF will keep off German Bombers-the script is written with the focus on the fact that he must deliver a rousing speech.<br /><br />Second:  The reigning King/Dynasty in Britain seem to align with the poets and playwrights.  This script treats the coup of \\"The Establishment\\" and King George VI against his older brother King Edward VIII as a natural, by-the-right occurrence.  It is remarkable that the play Richard III treats the defeat of King Richard by Henry Tudor as the same sort of a thing.  The play Richard III is alluded to in this movie also.

0307352153|4.0|Driving home from work on a Friday a few years ago, I was exhausted and frustrated. Robin, my wife (and carpool companion in those days), quietly listened to me vent. She asked me what I wanted to do. I replied that I wanted to have six or eight people over for a dinner party. She laughed and explained that my response was the most tell-tale sign of my extraversion. When exhausted, I seek energy from interacting with others.<br /><br />I recently read Susan Cain's Quiet hoping to learn more about the internal life of introverts. I wanted to better understand the one-third to one-half of the students and adults I work with who are introverts. I wanted to better understand my wife; Robin and I are the opposite on every letter of the Meyers-Briggs spectrum. I learned so much more.<br /><br />Cain convincingly argues that our society idealizes extraversion and the results are not necessarily ideal. I was particularly intrigued by her description of a national shift from a \\"culture of character\\" to a \\"culture of personality.\\" Cain writes that we have moved away valuing inner virtue to favoring, instead, \\"outer charm.\\"<br /><br />While it is hard to question that we do live in a society that idealizes extraversion, I was initially skeptical about her claim that the result of the extroverted social norm is often less effective. I, like many others, believed in the power of group processes. I like to think that \\"we are better together.\\" Cain presents a wide range of research that shows how groups often get in their own way. I was particularly convinced by her argument against the open office plan. I have started to believe, as Cain writes, that \\"If you have talented, motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.\\"<br /><br />Part Two of Quiet looks at the biology, the nature rather than the nurture, of quiet people. Cain digs deeply into the writings of Elaine Aron, the author of The Highly Sensitive Child as well as the Orchid Hypothesis. While I did not find this part of the book as compelling, it might resonate more for an introvert or the parent of an introvert.<br /><br />The final chapters of Quiet offer advice for introverts and extroverts alike. Here are a few things that I am now trying to do or consider:<br />- Extroverts often get their way and it is not always the right way. Cain references a funny Harvard Business Review comic with a stock chart plummeting and the caption, \\"It's all because of Fradkin. He has terrible business sense, but great leadership skills, and everyone is following him down the road to ruin.\\"<br />- Solo work is important: one company has a no-talk Thursday. I find that I need chunks of time to simply get things done. Give yourself the time.<br />- Extroverts should listen to introverts in the face of high stress situations.<br />- Free trait theory teaches us that we can act out of character in the service of work we consider important; this is how Cain, an introvert, gets the energy to speak to a room of thousands.<br />- Introverts and extroverts like each other.  Their opposites work well together. Phew. Robin, there is a reason we work.<br />- Group work is best done in smaller groups pairs or trios that are structured.<br />- Carve out restorative niches. As an introvert, give yourself the time to rest as you live in an extroverted world. As an extrovert, be sensitive to the needs of others.  I also now see that Friday night dinner party at the end of a tough week as my restorative niche.<br />- With introverted children, let them be themselves and assure them that there is nothing wrong with them for being introverted.<br /><br />Introverts are never called superficial; when you break past the cover of an introvert, you find tremendous depth. Quiet is an introverted book. Once you get past the cover you will find tremendous depth and a lot to learn.  If you don't have time for the book, Cain's Ted Talk is a great place to start..

0385523394|2.0|Like many memoirs, this one is self-serving.  But what makes this one particularly odd is that Ms. Kerman - in spite what I suppose are efforts to be introspective - seems unable to see glaring inconsistencies within her own personal narrative.<br /><br />First, a two-sentence plot summary: as a young woman in her early 20s, Piper Kerman helped launder money as part of a drug-smuggling operation.  Years later she was charged with her crimes and sentenced to thirteen months in Danbury minimum security prison.<br /><br />This memoir largely focuses on her time in Danbury, and the biggest inconsistency - one that permeates the entire book - is her description of that time.  Upon numerous occasions throughout the book, she proclaims prison to be a dump, the C.O.s to be cruel, petty, piggish, and ineffectual, and many of her fellow-prisoners to be \\"wackos\\".  If one focused only on these general characterizations, one might imagine that Ms. Kerman was describing scenes straight out of the `Shawshank Redemption'.  But even as she is painting these broad strokes, Ms. Kerman relates details of her life that seem to contradict them.  For example, the prison itself is described as having dormitories instead of cells, regular visiting hours, places to work, a weight room and a track, reasonable food, and movie & popcorn nights.  In Danbury she makes friends with many of her fellow inmates - friends who give her supplies, provide camaraderie and shoulders to cry upon, and throw her birthday parties.  She also benefits from the kindness of many correctional officers - officers who give her opportunities to work outside; officers who let her make phone calls; officers who deliberately pair her with good bunkmates; officers who are willing to bend the rules a bit.  Thus, her sweeping, angry diatribes against \\"the system\\" and those who work within it simply do not square with the day-to-day reality that she herself describes.<br /><br />Now please don't misunderstand me.  I think prison would scare the living daylights out of me, and I think the loss of freedom and control would be very difficult to handle.  Prison is no cakewalk, and it sounds like Ms. Kerman *did* have to deal with several mean guards.  But so far as I can tell, Ms. Kerman was not physically abused during her stay in prison.  She was harassed verbally and sometimes arbitrarily - but frankly most kids in middle-school are subject to far worse treatment.  This suggests to me that it was not the conditions in the prison...nor her fellow-prisoners...nor even the C.O.s that made her so angry.  Rather, it was her *situation* that infuriated her - thus her anger seems completely misplaced most of the time.<br /><br />Throughout the book, one can't help but feel as though Ms. Kerman is just a pretend person - going from one façade to another.  In her youth, she became a lesbian for a spell.  But she is definitely not a lesbian because she later falls in love with (and eventually marries) a man.  It sounds like she dated girls for a while because it was the \\"edgy\\" thing to do.<br /><br />At one particularly-bizarre point during the book, Ms. Kerman has a revelation that - though she has often prided herself on her stoicism, she is not a stoic.  This is a laughable revelation: of course she's not a stoic - she's a ball of emotion!  She sheds tears about everything from her imprisonment, to the death of her grandmother, to the Red Sox winning the 2007 World Series.  She's enraged by petty prison rules, rude prisoners, and minor travails.  She's fearful of change and of getting caught committing minor infractions.  Literally one page after proudly stating that many of her friends were impressed with her stoic attitude about entering prison, she describes herself as being \\"weepy\\" for a month.  I find it hard to believe that that Ms. Kerman could have ever imagined herself a stoic...and if she did...why?<br /><br />The last, and most inexcusable disconnect has to do with Ms. Kerman's attitude about the crimes that put her in prison.  At two points during the book, Ms. Kerman seems to own up to her culpability.  At one point she seems to realize that her white-collar money laundering had real and profound consequences for those addicted to the drug she helped smuggle.  She admits to having been selfish and thoughtless.  At another point she owns that she has only herself to blame for her situation.  Having made this mea culpa, one might expect Ms. Kerman to stop viewing the criminal justice system as the enemy - and to start taking some personal responsibility for her crimes.<br /><br />Alas - it is not to be.  Near the end of the book she is called-upon to testify against a fellow-drug-smuggling-conspirator.  Rather than welcome this as an opportunity to help the society she has hurt, she does everything in her power to avoid having to testify, expressing her distaste for being a \\"rat,\\" and her angst at the thought of having to travel to Chicago to testify.  She becomes furious with the woman who \\"drew her into\\" the drug smuggling ring - whom she blames (to a large extent) for her situation.  Thus, it seems clear that Ms. Kerman has learned very little from her stay in prison.  She has paid lip-service where lip service was due; she's served her time, and now she'd like to go, thank you very much.<br /><br />This book brings up some interesting questions about the prison system and what its purpose should be.  I admit that I have not thought sufficiently about this hugely complex topic.  But what's weird is that Ms. Kerman doesn't seem to have thought much about it either.  She's clearly not a fan of the existing prison system, or minimum sentencing guidelines, or the fact that prison has a \\"punitive\\" quality to it.  But these objections - though caged within a high-minded narrative - can also be read as transparently self-centered:  she doesn't like minimum sentences, or the punitive nature of prison because - for thirteen months - they became herlife.  And, after all, she's a reformed white-collar criminal with no plans to sin again, and so this whole prison thing just an unnecessary waste of time, right?<br /><br />There's no question that our prison system does need reform.  As Ms. Kerman correctly states, we incarcerate a greater fraction of our population than any other country in the world, and many of these people are repeat offenders who - having once entered the system - go around and around through a revolving door.  And of course, many of these people come from disadvantaged backgrounds, which makes the whole thing completely unfair.  But the irony here is that - in my opinion - it's people like Ms. Kerman who most deserve their punishment.  Here's a white, well-educated woman with a well-off, loving family and a great support network - a woman with every advantage - who nonetheless became involved in an international drug smuggling ring.  Spare me the \\"she was young and dumb\\" excuse; everybody is young and dumb once, but most people don't commit felonies.  Society does (and should!) expect better from people in their early 20s.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I thought that the title \\"Orange is the New Black,\\" might refer to the fact that people of color are disproportionately represented in our prisons.  I imagined that the book might focus on the problems associated with our prison system - and perhaps suggest some solutions.  But no, as I learned from reading the book, the title refers to the fact that some of Ms. Kerman's friends dressed in orange for a photo shoot and published the picture in a newspaper in solidarity with their imprisoned compatriot.  At first I was disappointed by this revelation...but upon further reflection, I think it's fittingly pithy for this remarkably self-absorbed book.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I loved the book but I found it hard to enjoy the movie because they left some key parts from the book that was hard to look past. I normally like to look at books that become movies as two different things all together but they left all the boring parts from the book in but none of the more action parts like the soccer game.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very fun! I don't play farm games anymore, but fell in love with this one. I like that you can earn a fair amount of gems without having to buy them.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I didn't find anything original about this movie. The plot was boring and I found it hard to care or sympathize with the characters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved it! Kept me interested gonna need to buy the rest of it. Good storyline. Was not boring at all, so m e spots made me jump lol.
1451666179|5.0|I've been excited about this book ever since I started reading the Hyperbole and a Half blog a few years ago. This book contains about a dozen new stories as well as some old ones that are just as enjoyable to read again. If you read it in public, be prepared for people to give you strange looks as you struggle not to laugh out loud.
0763644765|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old, who is interested in potty training, but not quite ready yet. Also, it's a board book, which is great for him. He loves this book! The day it arrived, he had me read it over and over again, and then he was reading it to everyone else. He carried it around for weeks, and it's still among his favorite books (he fell asleep with it tonight). Even his big brother got into it.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I really enjoy this calculator it comes in use at all times and i like that i can jus pull it up and use it when i need to
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Awesome as usual. Hypocresia is another powerful song, an instant salsa classic. The two versions of Vivir Mi Vida will keep you moving.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I chose to read this book because of the recent release of the movie. I did also know it was a really well-known sci-fi novel though.<br /><br />My experience reading science fiction has been kinda weird. I have not cared for much of what I have read. I don't like Asimov and couldn't get into \\"Dune.\\" I disliked most of the stories in this sci-fi anthology I bought (my first attempt at reading sci-fi). I disliked Terry Brooks's \\"Star Wars Episode I\\" novelization (not cause of the writing so much as the fact that it was EXACTLY like the movie, which I've seen multiple times, meaning I always knew exactly what was going to happen). I did like this one volume of steampunk stories I read, though, and the \\"Doctor Who\\" novels and stories I've read. I also liked The Hunger Games trilogy, Delirium, and Divergent. And I liked this book too, to an extent.<br /><br />My main issue is the intensity of the book. It is not an easy read. The amount of violence is, I suppose, somewhat appropriate to military science fiction (though I wouldn't know, this being the first military sci-fi novel I've read). But after a while you kinda wish you could get a reprieve. Yeah, I get it, there's a war on - or about to be on - but poor Ender never seems to get a break. Just when he thinks he can rest, he can't. He gets pushed to his breaking point and beyond.<br /><br />In a way, though, he ends up like Katniss or Frodo - the experience of war changes Ender, makes him so he can never be truly happy ever again. And I guess, realistically, war does change you like that. But Katniss at least got to settle down and have a family (with Peeta ugh) and Frodo got to go to the West with the Elves and Bilbo and lay down his burdens at last. Ender doesn't really get that sort of happy ending. Which is too bad.<br /><br />The book is definitely engaging though, and well-written. Lots of good world and character-building. Good use of 3rd person omniscient POV for sure. Even Graff, who you very quickly learnto hate in this book, sort of gets redeemed in the end.<br /><br />Would certainly recommended giving it a try!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like the game but it crashes a lot and usually when I just got a bingo. I then loose all info and start over again only with less credits. I prefer bingo bash more!
B0073COMUW|4.0|The quality and value of the product meets my expectations.<br /> I was happy with the purchase.  Probably will buy more.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I thought it was a well done movie/documentary. I am not vegan (though eat that way) nor am I a dirt person, anti business/corporation or any other ideological but it makes me angry the way the food industry controls so much. It was nice to see the truth put out about how the food industry is manipulating our food and telling us it is healthy and good for us while our society is the most unhealthy it has ever been. These guys have Washington in their pockets even deeper than any oil/coal could dream of.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful insight into how fragile life really is.  I could not put it down.  Teenagers should have to read it to get more appreciation for a healthy life.
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|This would be a solid 5 stars, but there's a missing element--the audience. If you listen to the sound production on Live at Budokan, the crowd is mic'd and very present. This is a direct mix from the board, and while the mix is excellent, and the instrumentation up front, along with a great HD mastered audio, that extra element of the crowd's energy is absent from the mix.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not good at these reviews. I love these books. I devour them. I can see myself and my world in these characters. Isn't that what makes a great story?
B001CDL6YS|1.0|This relates directly to the vinyl pressing. Buyers beware. Side 4 repeats \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" even though it's labeled \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part II\\"<br /><br />I contacted Roadrunner directly, and they were very sympathetic, so much that they assured me it would be dealt with. They sent me a new vinyl copy in the mail and said it was a \\"promotional copy\\" and would not contain the problem.  Low and behold, the same outcome.<br /><br />This was an across the board manufacturing error. NO correct copies are out there.<br /><br />Someone else here posted something about a German pressing being correct, and perhaps that is possible, but Roadrunner said they didn't know anything about it.<br /><br />To their credit though, a really great customer service worker from Roadrunner apologized and sent me a few Dream Theater CDs to pass out to my friends.<br /><br />3 sides is at least better than no sides, if you're a fan of Systematic Chaos, but unfortunately this one on vinyl is not complete. Hopefully the people at Music On Vinyl will release an updated edition like other Dream Theater titles.
B00000ING2|5.0|Prompt delivery, the dvd was in good condition, now on to the film itself ...  This is a fantastic movie, one of the great Coen Bros. films that I think is often overlooked.  The cinematography is amazing as always (Roger Deakins).  The writing is perfect, there are moments in this movie where the dialogue seems like poetry.  My two favorite scenes:<br />1.  In the diner, when Robbins and Leigh first meet.  The two cabbies describing their interaction is fantastic.<br />2.  The design, production, marketing, introduction, fall and discovery of the hula-hoop.  In my opinion, this is one of the most amazing scenes in all of film.  Perfect, beautiful, hilarious, joyful, this scene alone is enough to carry the whole movie.  I don't have the words.<br />Please watch it, you won't regret it.
B000002KDO|5.0|THE BAND:<br />Ozzy Osbourne - Vocals<br />Tony Iommi - Guitar<br />Geezer Butler - Bass guitar<br />Bill Ward - Drums<br /><br />THE SOUND:<br />Good mixed.The down tuning of the guitars and bass brought about an even heavier sound than what was heard in earlier records. The heavy, down-tuned sound also helped take Sabbath's slow, sludgy sound a step further.<br />Distorted riffs, tortured solos, crushing bass, wailing vocals,there is plenty of everything any fan of the early Sabbath might want.<br /><br />THE TRACKS:<br /><br />Sweet Leaf: Classic opener,song structure with their slow, crushing grooves and faster middle parts,certainly ranks as a defining stoner metal song, making its references to marijuana use.Iommi recalls \\"We all played Sweet Leaf while stoned\\"<br /><br />After Forever: This has a riff that likely launched many a NWOBHM band.The lyrics philosophizes about death and the afterlife in an openly religious fashion that offered a blueprint for the career of Christian doom band Trouble<br /><br />Embryo: Is a 25 second instrument solo, placed just to fill<br /><br />Children of the Grave: Is driven by a galloping rhythm that would later pop up on a slew of IRON MAIDEN tunes, among many others.This song posits a stark choice between love and nuclear annihilation.One of Sabbath's BEST SONGS.<br /><br />Orchid: is a more complete instrumental,whit which balances, but does seem a bit shallow.<br /><br />Lord of this World: Begins with a lurching, stop-start riff that you'll be dying to hum along to. The voice of Ozzy sound amazing and the guitars make your ribcage vibrate.This is the sound that has become all but Sabbath's TRADEMARK.<br /><br />Solitude: Written by Bill Ward,is musically like a Jethro Tull or Moody Blues song with flutes and bells, but the depressive lyrics help it fit in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Into the Void: Which shortens the distances between the multiple sections of the band's previous epics.And there's the CORE of the album.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy setup.<br />Easy to use, beautiful picture quality and tone.<br />So far Netflix and Youtube work great, You just click the cast button and it immediately jumps to the tv.<br />Both my Android phone (HTC One ) and W8 laptop work great with it.<br />Using Chrome browser you can cast the whole tab to the TV, mirroring your device.<br />Totally worth it- I love it so far! It makes my phone and laptop interact with my TV.
0316219266|5.0|I loved this book.  And I loved the reviews.  Together they explain the man, the culture, and why the company is on its way from great to greater.  Nowhere but on Amazon could the founder be dissected and the author taken to task, while the participants debate the truth and the crowd buys the book.<br /><br />First the book.  It's a long series of mostly well-told anecdotes, capturing the biggest stories from Amazon's first two decades.  Despite the complaints from participants about the accuracy of the narrative (and even the fallacy of using narrative) there is a ring of truth to it.  The company is maniacally focused on the customer, driven by a founder who is wicked smart and sometimes witheringly dismissive.  The success is built on a foundation that includes many failures and Darwinian treatment of competitors.  Its combative culture is not every employee's cup of tea.<br /><br />Stone may have interviewed a few too many disgruntled \\"escapees\\" who are no longer with the company, and he seems overly sympathetic to the publishers who have been ground under, and acquisition targets who have been gobbled up.  But these are minor faults in a riveting and revealing story.<br /><br />If the book is a great read, the reviews are color commentary that adds depth and perspective.  MacKensie Bezos' out-of-the-gate one star review reveals a wife who knows best, and loves most the patriarch.  Shel Kaplan's thoughtful four-star essentially confirms the painful story of the company outgrowing his early programming contributions.  And Josh Weinstein's (best friend from high school) three star, corrects some of Stone's pejorative language, casting a very different and warmer light on the CEO's personality.  Topping it off, we have another one star from the PR department who feel deeply slighted that they weren't given an opportunity to fact check in advance.<br /><br />Altogether, a great package.  Read it all.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Exciting. Great story lines.  Engaging characters( even when they are unlike able).  An implausible situation (fake lawyer) is made to seem very plausible.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The unique craft of this author's style enhances a absolutely riveting story, so realistic you swear you know all of the characters.  Death as the narrator......unnerving and lovingly sweet all in the same breath!  Live on, Leisel, Papa, Mama, golden haired Rudy, and our memory of the terrible tragedy of man's capability to hurt and to heal!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great app to download! My only complaint is that I can't quit playing it!!!  Easy to use and I have had no problems with the app.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books on this series but the third one seemed to read much slower and I was not fond of the author killing off one of her main characters. I also had troubles differentiating between who was speaking. Tris and Four seemed too similar to me.
0894803123|5.0|How can you go wrong with recipes from Ben and Jerry?  The recipes I've tried so far are great, and the background info about the company and ice cream making are really interesting as well!
B0063GORYU|5.0|love, love this game! I hate spiders though and wish there was not a  spider on the cards I understand why it is there though.
0064440346|5.0|Owl at home is charming and calming.  bring a little peace to your bedtime stories, and if you love peas soup and buttered toast, you'll be right at home with Owl at Home.
0385743564|4.0|Read this because of a FB recommendation. Not my type of book - I prefer my superhero stories in moves / tv - but I really enjoyed it. Parts of the book reminded me of another superhero book I read last year - Stimulus by Joseph Gharagheer. Definitely something I would recommend and am going to start looking at some of Sanderson's other books.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|What a nice change from all those other hunting games out there. Glu Mobile has done it again. Fantastic graphics. So much fun.
1933865407|5.0|If you are a fan of Bruce Timm as I am, you MUST get this book! Having been a fan of Timm's style since he started on Batman the Animated Series, this book was a no-brainer for me.  Book is oversized, printed on good quality paper.  Very nice artwork!  This book, as my title and the cover pictured suggest, is all about Timm's take on the ladies.  From sexy superheroines, to sexy horror covers to a LOT of female nude studies, this book is all about Bruce Timm's style of the female form.  For me, it did not disappoint!  To all the Bruce Timm fans out there, do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever play that's about puzzles. I would tell my friends about this game.I gave this a 5

B0050KEVO6|5.0|It is so much fun. It is also addictive. You keep telling yourself &#34;just one more game&#34;!!!  Join in the fun!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|One of the best films I have seen in a long time! Tells a story that isn't off the wall. The reality  of a pilot's life, the pressures that come with it, and the role an alcohol, and drug addiction can play on one's life, and career choices. Teaches us humility, in the sense the consequences should not effect our choice to be honest and forth coming in any situation. Shows us we should accept the facts, and avoid pointing fingers at others, to save our own hide. The truth shall set you free, Denzel's Final and most important message in this film.... A man choosing to be free behind bars, rather being imprisoned by his guilt in the world. Awesome Film, do watch!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I didn't try the first installment of Angry Birds Star Wars as it would not work on my first gen. Kindle Fire. This has been great to play and have had no issues with playing it. My kids all love it and it is an excellent time waster. I can't wait to try the rest of the episodes.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Five stars for sure the best show ever! I'm so addicted to this show every episode keeps me so invovled
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|I enjoy playing it.  I have been able to figure it out.  I'm not good with computer games like Mario but I can do this. I feel proud<br />of myself. It's good.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|great movie - Denzel as usual in a highly moral movie where a man has to deal with his conscience.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy it.  I play it a lot.  Again, I don't usually play computer games but this game I'm good at.  I enjoy it. I can win.<br />I don't want it to end.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Spooky, spooky movie. Kept me interested and glued to the screen the whole time. Popcorn and someone to protect you...you'll be fine!! I hugged my German Shepherd through the spooky spots! :) Note: My husband was too scared and left us alone.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun, challenging! BEWARE very addictive!  Every level is solvable though you may wonder at times. My favorite game.
B00ARN0ZF0|5.0|Grab your popcorn and someone to watch with, cause this is a great spooky movie in a long line of great spooky movies. If you liked the first 3...you'll like this one, too! :)
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I'm a fan of the Superman films from 30 years ago and I loved 'Superman Returns' even though I thought the hero didn't get enough screen time to do his thing and Lois didn't come off like a truly seasoned journalist (but Kevin Spacey was THE Lex, way better than Hackman).  I was hoping for a strong sequel to 'SR', but instead got some guy in scale mail armor in a grim, grey, depressing Batman movie.  The beginning on Krypton was interesting, but it really went downhill from there-- Zod's face is like a plastic mask of caricatured anger with bad dentures that make him mushmouthed, they made Lois even more bland than in SR (and her interaction with Superman is very different than any other version I'm aware of), and I just didn't think Superman was an interesting character-- he was too human for my taste.  If this guy is so super, then why is it such a dilemma for him to figure out how to operate covertly?  I'm also seriously getting sick of this trend of 'color backlash' which now afflicts almost all superheroes on film, and I don't see why the Man of Steel would need what appears to be scale-mail armor.  I've reached my 'realism' threshold for this genre and I'm ready for it to be fantastical and fun again.  If I want real drama, there's plenty of it in real life.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first book Divergent was one of my favorites, the second Insurgent was mediocre, but Allegiant is horrible. A complete and total let down. I am very disappointed. Can we pretend it was never written?
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Very interesting, practical, lots of things to put into practice! Gets you motivated! I will be referring to the research she cites when I need to talk to people about behavior change. It is especially helpful in identifying the mind sets we fall into that sabotage behavior change, with great research findings to back her examples up. She is a fun writer, very conversational while giving the reader a lot of value.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Great kids movie, inspirational and teaches kids a great lesson for life. Highly recommend for any child, fun for parents too

0345529057|5.0|I'm a fan of the show and the books are great! Service from supplier was superb got the books on time in perfect condition and at a wonderful price I was searching for the set had it at walmart once and I didn't have the money came back the next week store looked at me crazy n said they never sold it when I was there with a friend telling him Id like this set for my birthday... After looking around for it at a reasonable price when I got a lovely email from amazon with my book set at a wonderful price and availability. I recommend buying the set from amazon it's so worth it!!!! I haven't gotten thru all the books yet but my brother has and if your a fan of Games like I am these books are so riveting full of drama tragedy suspense and gore!!!! I absolutely love it!!! Good reading and shopping y'all!!

B00EVW04PE|5.0|Highly recommended movie. Very nice and very lovely i like it very much . I will give it five star.one of the best movies in 2013
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|Loved the movie.  I'd love to see the additional hours of bonus features but I don't want to go the UltraViolet route with the Blue Ray.  iTunes only talks about 30 minutes of background on Superman.  Does this download include the bonus features on the Blue Ray physical version?
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|not everyone has facebook. this game useless without. I refuse to have facebook and I think the world needs to realize NOT. everyone has or wants fb and apps need to stop directing that way.<br />good thing this was free to only be able to get to level 35. not worth paying for.
B008JFUS0U|4.0|I thought Thor 2 the Dark World was really good. I think its very sad that Kenneth Branagh didn't return to direct or Patrick Doyle to compose. I think it would been an amazing series of films if they would of stayed on board. I do believe Alan Taylor did a good job of letting people know he wasn't going to take a dump on the world that Kenneth B. established. I like the direction he went but it was at the same time what has been hurting Marvel films. I think with their continued overuse of comedy it is truly hurting their films. I mean you get a touching or sad moment or a great fight and than a pointless humor scene for no reason. I think they really need to lose all the humor or they will begin to lose the hardcore comic readers. I truly hope they get rid of the over use of comedy in these films it truly is getting old.<br /><br />Script-I give the script a C because of the over use of comedy and how the villain died *Spoiler Alert*(really a ship kills a guy that was all powerful and some dumb rods that make things disappear... OK! lmao) but the action sequences were great.<br /><br />Actors-I thought every actor that they brought in did a great job. I think the only part that kinda bothered me was Joshua Dallas no longer being Fandral. The new actor does look the part though and doesnt do too bad of a job.<br /><br />Musical Score-The musical score was absolutely awful. I give it an F. It was by far nothing but blaring nonsense that had no emotion that Patrick Doyle's previous theme had<br /><br />Action-I give the action an A+. I think the action really saved this film for me and I think they are some of the very best I have ever seen. They aren't a super A+ like Man of Steel had but they were still great. Man of Steel had in my opinion some of the greatest fight scenes of all time.<br /><br />Story Locations-I think Asgard looked great as I remember from that great Kenneth B film and I loved seeing other realms like the Dark Elves world and hinting at Surtur'sfiery realm!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever is the final book in the fever series. In the final book the characters are almost ready to get what they have all been hunting throughout the series. Also the main characters have fallen in love and also that they are both now hard to kill.
0061673730|5.0|After having this book recommended to me a few times and reading references to it more than a few, I finally got around to reading this book.  The author's binding connection to actual experiences and philosophy become not only intriguing but practical, dare I say- something that unfortunately is not often associated with philosophy.<br />Throughout this book, there are many references to the Greek play Phaedrus.<br />All too often. Philosophy is supposed to be left to the self- proclaimed, so- called intellects.  This book is a great read all the way through and it is all too sad regarding the tragic murder of the author's son.<br />This is a must read book.

B004D20JP2|1.0|Scary movie for children. Dark and definitely not for little ones.  My kids were covering their eyes within 5 minutes, when an older man in the movie began to hurt a little boy Peter. Terrible!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Great movie!  I enjoy watching movies with Tom Cruise, I think he is a great actor that is under appreciated.  I recommend this movie to anyone.

B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Some of the screens were quite a challenge. The difficulty increases with the<br />Size of the grid.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Great watch at a great price. Keeps good time. It is  just like the watch I had back in the 70'S.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|To paraphrase Louis Pasteur: \\"...chance favors the prepared mind.\\"  While no doubt more scholarly than my depth, it is clear to me that this well-written and compelling book is colored by the author's rejection of Christianity.  It seems Dr Aslan found what he was looking for and made an interesting book of it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best because of all the different things you can do. It's also the top rated game in the world. At lest 18,734,294 people play on it every day. Minecraft will not be forgotten because all the different updates add a lot of new features. Like this<br />update that is coming out 0.8.0 . That update will add rails, shifting, running, and lots more.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I absolutely love this app! since I am not a morning person I depend on my alarm clock and this alarm has proven to work every time and it keeps me on time...Love it!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Schlosser paints a frightening picture of the history of the safekeeping and safeguarding of the most destructive devices ever built by Man.  Built around the narrative of an accidental explosion of a Minuteman II missile silo in Damascus, Arkansas, he examines the policies, programs, and politics of America's stewardship of its nuclear arsenal. Always interesting, and often disturbing, this book will open your eyes to a world that few are privy to.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Lady Gaga is one of those artists who has a strong  sense of melody, timing and  understands a hook and a  groove.  i ain't even gonna lie \\"Do what u want with my body\\"  her and the King of R&B  R.Kelly is the business and truth is that is the best media and parinoid  late era cut from the King of Pop Michael Jackson we never got.  its the kind of song which Gaga needs more along with the title track.  when she isn't trying so hard with cramming every hook and groove and over doing  the Production when she does a less is more approach then she is a unbeatable act. if the gimmicks don't  override her talent then i think she has a chance to go down as a important artist in time,however at times she tries a bit too much and it brings down alot of promise. now this album is better than the last album and i think with less pressure and just allowing her creatiivty shine she  will alright as a artist and this album has alot of promise just as long as she doesn't step over her own shoes.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This movie is perfectly cast with A list actors and is much more textured and nuanced than the first Superman movie.  Don't get me wrong... I actually loved the first movie and thought it was well done but this new movie successfully has carved out it's own niche.  The first go at Superman had a lot of humor in it but this film takes a much more dramatic approach.  The special effects were dazzling with the final battle scene between Zod's forces and Superman seems so realistic.<br /><br />I highly recommend you watching this movie and if you buy films worthy of adding to your film collection then hurry to your store and buy it!
B00F91H666|2.0|This was more of an action movie than a thriller.  I thought it was very predictable and boring.  I fell asleep before it was over.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This is a story about prejudice, and racial hatred.  A very sad era of our history, but knowing the way negroes were treated in our country is deplorable, however, true.  America is supposed to be a free county, where everyone should be treated equal, regardless of color or race or nationality.  We are, after all, human beings who suffer, love, and experience every emotion imaginable.  We all feel pain in one way or another.  There was a saying I heard many years ago, which is very true.  &#34; There is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us, that it ill behooves any of us to talk about the rest of us.&#34;
B000QVDKS2|4.0|Music is, obviously, a matter of taste.  I came to this recording based on a brief review in The Absolute Sound, and I knew very little about the sound of Dire Straits.  Musically it makes a great first impression, even though I listen primarily to classical and jazz, and there's very little in the classic rock genre that ever floated my boat.  However, much of the attention given this recording is due to its fine engineering.  On that I can attest it is worthy of being in any audiophile's collection for the tickling of your audio system (and of your ears).

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|As a bit of a Civil War history buff (especially Gettysburg), I looked forward to seeing this movie in the theatre and it didn't disappoint.  Liked it so much, I bought this set so I could watch it again whenever I wanted.  Extremely well-done production and Daniel Day-Lewis is awesome as President Lincoln.  Highly recommend ... very easy to get completely wrapped up in the story, despite knowing the obvious outcomes.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A different perspective of what is truly happening on the other side of the world.  Makes you wonder about the power of the world leaders or so called leaders.  Makes you stop and think in different terms.  Makes me thankful I was born in America.  I can't imagine not being educated and able to speak out on different subjects.  How sad for their country.  How sad for the women over there. This book should be a must read for all schools in the U.S.A. so that we are not in our little comfort cocoon.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|There was a lot of great action and drama. The only drawback was a full frontal nude scene at the very start of the movie. Otherwise, it would be great for young teens to watch so they can see the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse.
140006922X|5.0|This book by Reza Aslan flitters around a lot, but is an unqualified eye-opener. It's the gospel Jesus versus the historical Jesus. Who is right and who is wrong is up to each reader to decide. Mr. Aslan has certainly done plenty of research, but he has the undertone of a former Muslim about him. I say this only so the reader can take what Aslan says with a grain of salt. He is obviously schooled in both religions, but seems to prefer the historical Jesus as the true son of God. With the gospels written many years after Jesus's death, does anybody really know the truth? The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were written well after Jesus's death. The events of Jesus's life are hazy at best since Mark and Luke (some say he was) were not eyewitnesses to Jesus's life. The gospel of Matthew is by an anonymous author, and the gospel of John is authored by `the disciple whom Jesus loved', but is not named. Aslan states that his research took two decades, and he supplies about sixty pages of notes at the end of the book. I guess one can't ask for more. But for me, some of his revelations are truly stunning. Why was this Christ so different from all the other messiahs that traveled through Jerusalem during Jesus's time preaching repentance and damnation? They were also convicted of sedition (rebellious acts against the Roman Empire) and crucified, or beheaded. Why were they not the true Christ? Especially, John the Baptist .<br /><br />According to Aslan, Christ didn't leave Nazareth till he was about thirty years old. On page 88, (to paraphrase Aslan) he says, \\"Before his encounter with John (the Baptist), Jesus was an unknown peasant and day laborer toiling away in Galilee.\\" If Jesus was the main man, why did he come to the Jordan River to be baptized by John? Yet the gospels try to make the reader feel that John the Baptist was inferior to Jesus. In fact, After John was seized and put to death by Roman Tetrarch (governor of the region) Antipas, only then did Jesus's first disciples, Andrew and Philip, leave John the Baptist and follow Jesus on his quest to cleanse the souls of mankind. This is some strong information. Aslan also states that Jesus was born in Nazareth, and not Bethlehem. Jesus had brothers, most notably, James, who took over the leadership of the Catholic Church after Jesus's death. Also stunning is that Jesus, because of his peasant status, could not read or write any language. This is not me talking. This book is very thought provoking and obviously highly controversial.<br /><br />Another fact that is historically disputed is the disposition of Pontius Pilate, the fifth governor Rome, sent to oversee Judea. The gospels present Pilate as a weak-willed governor who didn't want to kill Jesus until the Jews demanded that Jesus should be put to death. The Jews were not pleased when Jesus entered Jerusalem riding a donkey with a mob of people shouting, \\"Hosanna!\\" Aslan says in his book, \\"The message conveyed to the city's inhabitants is unmistakable: the long awaited messiah-the true King of the Jews-has come to free Israel from its bondage.\\" Aslan says history shows Pontius Pilate to be a very violent man who hated and killed Jews at will. Wow, that's not the Pilate I saw back in the 1970s, when I went to the marvelous play, 'Jesus Christ Superstar: A Rock Opera' . Pilate with the help of the Jewish High Priest, Joseph Caiaphas, had no hesitation in sentencing Jesus to death.<br /><br />One fact that is consistent both historically and gospel-wise is Jesus's ability to heal. On page 105, Aslan says, \\"For while debates raged within the early church over who Jesus was-a rabbi? the messiah? God incarnate? -there was never any debate, either among his followers or his detractors, about his role as an exorcist and miracle worker.\\" Okay, both sides finally agree. This was a time when there were many magicians charging money to perform similar feats, but Jesus never imposed a fee. As Jesus approached Jerusalem in 30 c.e. (common era) \\"...it is not just Jesus's miraculous actions that they fear; it is the simple yet incredibly dangerous message conveyed through them: the Kingdom of God is at hand.\\" On page 126, Aslan says, \\"No wonder, then, that at the end of his life, when he stood beaten and bruised before Pontius Pilate to answer the charges made against him, Jesus was asked but a single question...\\"Are you the King of the Jews?\\"<br /><br />Was Jesus's last words on the cross (gospel of Mark), \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" And did the resurrection really happen three days later? Who is James the Just? Did Jesus really say, \\"I say to you that you shall be called Peter, and upon this rock I shall build my church.\\"  I've only touched on a few of the enlightening discoveries this reviewer learned from reading Aslan's book about the historical Jesus. I have the feeling that Jesus was more of a man, than the Son of God. In fact, according to Aslan's research, Jesus rebuffed the messianic titles given to him and preferred the title, \\"The Son of Man.\\" In my opinion, Aslan did a remarkable job putting this non-fiction work together. I felt somber when Jesus's three year old ministry came to an end. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples (also called apostles), let the Jewish hierarchy know where Jesus was hiding after 'The Last Supper'. Aslan states, \\"He is praying when they come for him...\\" This is a sad and provocative book. I highly recommend this book by Reza Aslan.e.

B008JFUR10|5.0|Giant mechas versus colossal extradimensional monsters - what's not to love? Okay, so maybe the concept sounds a bit campy, and certainly could have come off that way if handled the same way as a Syfy movie of the week. But Pacific Rim delivers pure cinematic fun.  The special effects were amazing and certainly one of the great attractions of this movie. The design of both the giant mechas, the Jaegers, and the monsters, the Kaijus, was spectacular with great attention to detail. The look and movement of both seemed realistic for machines and creatures of their size.<br /><br />I thought the acting was solid all the way around, with lots of interesting characters thrown into the mix. The need to have 2 pilots controlling a mecha, while a bit of a contrivance, does help lend itself to more character interaction and emotional interplay. These aren't just soldiers fighting together on a battlefield (which itself is a strong bond) - these are warriors who have their very minds linked in order to seamlessly control a 200 foot tall death machine.<br /><br />Now granted you can't too tangled up in logic if you are going to enjoy this movie. For instance, the Kaijus always emerge from the exact same spot in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so why not just have bombers on station ready to nuke the suckers as soon as they come through the portal while they are safely out in the middle of nowhere - well because then you wouldn't be able to make an awesome movie about giant robots fighting alien monsters. Also, the leaders of the world decide that instead of continuing to build more Jaegars, they should instead invest all their energy into building giant walls around civilization. Ignoring the fact that it takes your typical city traffic authority 5 years and 20 million dollars to fix a 5 mile stretch of road, why would anyone think a wall would be a better defense than giant robots. Clearly those in power didn't take the coolness factor into their calculations. Giant mechas always beat giant walls. Remember that if you ever find yourself on a city planning council.<br /><br />So as long as you can leave the critical analysis at the theater door (or save it for the internet chat rooms afterwards), and you are someone who enjoys an action movie full of epic monster battles, you are sure to enjoy Pacific Rim.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|It's not so great. I bought three books in the series to see how it ended but when I realized there were nine books and continuing I gave up. I can't endure that!! What a waste.

B003V1WUKS|5.0|captures the dark, hidden corners of the mind that most people would rather not face. instead of sweeping facts of life under the table, reality in put in plain view. in a world as abundant as america it is shocking to read about the conflict that arises out of being a teenager or young adult. the stories tell of the restrictions and set backs that confronts the protagonists and how they deal with the situations they find themselves in. it tells of traumas experienced at a young age with no adults around to caution, console or supervise. in that way it tells tales that have universal appeal. every country has a world of shadows that is scary to explore. everyone will be able to relate and if not, then the book serves as a warning of what is really out there for the majority who dont lead sheltered lives.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, intelligent and fascinating stories. Yeah, there's the usual protagonist pair that never seems to fail, there's the usual annoying characters that seem to keep trying to make the protagonist's lives miserable, but never succeed. Seems predictable, but there's enough new content for non-law professionals to keep them at the edge of their seats.

B003NRYMZQ|3.0|Season 1... I liked it and it was okay.  I'm liking season 2 much, much more because the cast seems more cohesive and the story lines aren't just about who's sleeping with who and Jack shooting people/aliens.  Season 1 was definitely a building season both for the cast and writers.  I highly suggest moving on to season 2 if you're having a hard time getting into season 1.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Blackmore is one of the most original soloist of the &#34;rock generation&#34;era guitarists (e.g. 1960's through early '80's) Classically  trained, his playing seamlessly moves from minor to major scale modalities, and the tones he produces from his Stratocaster and 100-watt Marshall amps are incredibly emotive and sensual. Although equally talented with acoustic and electric instruments, I remember hearing the very first  Deep Purple album (titled appropriatelly Shades of DEEP PURPLE), which included several great covers (Hush, Kentucky Woman, Help) and just being totally blown away!  Blackmore's guitar sounds like a 100-lb violin. He is simply an extraordinary musician,and just keeps bringing it with each new release<br /><br />Rickey Lee Collins
B00BESM14U|2.0|I was prepared to give this movie 4 stars until the part about putting Mary Elizabeth down; along with her lifestyle and Vegans along with her.  \\"It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us has cancer so that I don't have to break up with her\\" WTF really? could have been a nice movie if the Vegan bashing was left out.  I can only imagine some selfish, weak, meat eating dudes had to throw that in (was it part of the book?) bc of some cowardice they can't overcome to become Vegan themselves.  What the movie does such a good job at portraying homosexuality in a positive light, they take it all back with the Vegan bashing.  Totally ruined the movie.\<br /><br />  Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie; though I never understood just what the perks of being a wallflower were....

B000F0UUIM|5.0|Discovered by film enthusiastists and the filmmakers of the 3rd wave (Scorcese, Penn, et al) this has been declared the greatest Western. I don't agree that it's the best John Ford Western, however (any one of his Calvary trilogy can match it and for epic journey, Stagecoach is the one), but for sheer cinema muscle and a star turn by John Wayne it's a very modern treatment of the fires of conflict that blazed in the Old West, including racism, rage, and an all consuming vengeance.<br />Filmed in full color in and around Ford's favorite location, Monument Valley and inspired by a real life incident in Texas in the early 1800s, it follows a small posse led by Wayne in a decade long search for a kidnapped white girl by a Comanche band. It's reputation as the best stems from John Wayne's heroic obsessive journey but less than heroic bloodlust, a deconstruction of the role we are used to seeing him perform, and for that he is spot on.  In this more modern view, the Great American Cowboy is stripped of his more romantic notions of prior decades and whether he is right or wrong is revealed to be more complex. Leave it to John Ford to turn the stereotype on its ear for he was one of the few who explored it early on in some of his other Westerns as well (See Henry Fonda in Fort Apache). Though Ford did help write the book on the game saving calvary charge, his relations between white frontiersmen and native Indians are seen both in black & white and as often in gray.<br />Film fans will love all the extras and the deluxe set can be found at extremely affordable prices for this magnificent treatment.
0930073193|5.0|I want to believe that every economist - regardless of where he stands in the spectrum of economic (and political) beliefs - considers the typhoon Haiyan in Phillipines a disaster. After all, thousands of people have lost their lives. It is never a good thing. But once we put this aside (which is not easy to do) and look at what it means for the country (as a whole) economically, the unity disappears.<br /><br />According to the prevalent economic wisdom today, the typhoon Haiyan, having caused a lot of DESTRUCTION, should nonetheless be considered a BLESSING. It will set \\"miracles of production\\" in motion, leading to economic growth.<br /><br />But is it really so?<br /><br />Of course not. How could it possibly be? It makes no sense. To explain it economically, we have to discern need from demand. Yes, there will be a need to rebuild the houses, the roads, the schools, the airports and everything else that was leveled to the ground. But NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY A DEMAND! A real demand requires corresponding PURCHASING POWER - the accumulated savings and capital!<br /><br />Now,<br /><br />If there is a purchasing power, what a destruction like this mainly does is that it diverts the economic activity from place A to place B. It changes the structure of an economy, the balance of industries. If there is no purchasing power, the country can either borrow the funds or print new money. Both options are costly though. The former means the sacrifice tomorrow to repay the debt. The latter, well, besides being immoral, is not even a (real) solution!<br /><br />The \\"BLESSINGS OF DESTRUCTION\\" is only ONE OF THE MANY ECONOMIC FALLACIES that Henry Hazlitt refutes in his book 'Economics in one lesson.' He does so in a clear and simple way. Though first written 67 years ago, it is as timely today as it can get.<br /><br />The \\"general lesson\\" you are expected to learn is this: Given a policy, you need to look at the long-term effects (not only immediate ones), indirect consequences (not only direct ones), and the impact of the policy on all groups of people (not only one of them).<br /><br />If you became interested in the \\"AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS\\" - the alternative to the Keynesian economics of the 20th century, the alternative to fiat paper money system and ever-growing government, the alternative to the crony capitalism in which profits are privatized and losses are socialized, the alternative whose voice has been suppressed by the \\"Holy Trinity\\" (Government, Universities, Wall Street) - this book is not only A MUST READ, but also a good place to start.ces (not only direct ones), and the impact of the policy on all groups of people (not only one of them).<br /><br />If you became interested in the \\"AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS\\" - the alternative to the Keynesian economics of the 20th century, the alternative to fiat paper money system and ever-growing government, the alternative to the crony capitalism in which profits are privatized and losses are socialized, the alternative whose voice has been suppressed by the \\"Holy Trinity\\" (Government, Universities, Wall Street) - this book is not only A MUST READ, but also a good place to start.
B00F031WB8|5.0|For a brand new 2 hour documentary the low price is on the mark. This film does Hendrix' career justice by including a wealth of studio material, photographs, and many sight and sound examples of live performances.<br /><br />As Jimi's first manager (ex-Animal Chas Chandler, one of its better interviewees) states convincingly, Hendrix was not a tragic figure and his warm and fun loving but shy personality is evident throughout the film.  His early death is tragic to be certain, but his short life's work is infinitely brilliant.  The film is heavy on the 4 compressed years of his recording career and manages to include interviews with those who knew him best during this period. Kudos to the film's compilers for drawing on the important recollections of the now deceased Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, and Chas Chandler.  Wouldn't be complete without the views from his bandmates and they are in ample supply here.<br /><br />Not only is his virtuoso playing in evidence, it is also emphasized that Hendrix was not only a brilliant guitar stylist but a composer and sound shaper of the highest order.  His collaborations with sympathetic engineer Eddie Kramer were magnificent sonic statements and a strong argument is made, in spite of false notions that Hendrix was spent, that if not for his manic touring schedule and money woes and, finally, his death there would not have been many more amazing efforts by the two of them.<br /><br />I remembered thinking that when he died that he had \\"probably peaked anyway\\", which was a callous way for a 19 year old to rationalize his loss, the end of such an immense talent who had contributed so much to the musical landscape of my youth.  I could not have been more wrong, it is painfully obvious from this film that Hendrix was going strong and the music was still pouring from him. Had he transitioned to managing his finances and lifestyle even nominally, this film (in statements by Kramer and others) leaves no doubt his recording output would have continued and reached new heights.  One of the better rock n' roll documentaries for its highlighting of its subject's music.

B00GBCMW9S|3.0|While his rapping is better than ever, these songs just don't stick with you like his older stuff. They just don't flow, they aren't memorable... Outside of the single Bezerk, none of the songs have a sing a long type chorus... Really a bummer since his verses are better than ever but his chorus's just feel flat for me and the tracks he chose were disjunct. Doesn't feel very thought out.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I think we take the most important people in our lives for granted sometimes.  Harold and Maureen were able to rekindle their relationship and realize what is truly important in life.  Yes, we can't go back and change difficult experiences, but we can move forward together.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book because it's inspirational to the teens who don't really know where they belong and that life is what you make it. To always do what you believe in even when no one else does cause at the end of the day, it's just you and the truth. Two things no one can change, because they are what they are. I recommend this to anyone who struggles to be who they are.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|Found myself transported by this account of a boy, Theo, whose perceptions of life and art are distorted, but also expanded and intensified by the traumatic loss of his beloved mother, followed by neglect in his adolescence and years of drug use and alienation into adulthood. Theo commits serious crimes but it becomes very hard to say at some point if these are wrong, if they create more harm than good, if they outweigh his impulse towards nonjudgmental friendship, caring and love, and if--even though Theo feels persistently, deeply guilty--he is guilty in a moral sense. A gripping mystery, interesting characters and relationships, compelling philosophical questions, and beautiful, sensual descriptions. This book explored things that are hard to talk about--the feeling of timelessness, severe painful beauty and specialness that are the strange compensation for trauma, depression and marginalization; the alternative ethics that may accompany unspeakable experiences and the perceptions that they yield; and, most impressively, the way that art can draw us into that timeless, sweet yet painful liminal space between the sacred and profane. I couldn't stop reading the book, read it too quickly even though it's long, and miss it now that I'm done.

0525478817|4.0|The Fault in our Stars will teach you how to appreciate the faults and lack of faults in yourself. John Green, well-known youtuber, captures the reality of cancer patients (not stars) in an eloquently yet moderately explicit plot. You will definitely not not like this book because who doesn't love an educative book that has a riveting plot style with out-of-this-world vocabulary? Personally, this book has shown me the value of appreciation and enjoyment because life is essentially the shortest long thing we have. Life always feels short, but it is the longest thing we have. And this book has urged me to enjoy this \\"short\\" time we have, because it can be over in a heartbeat. Overall, if you're looking for an entertaining, deep, and educative book, The Fault in Our Stars will not disappoint.<br /><br />By the way, the title of this review and its rating are related. I rated this book 4 stars, and not 5, because I felt like Green could have utilized more plots with the number of pages he used. That may mean nothing to you, and that's because it doesn't. The book is, nonetheless, spotless. I'm just saying it could have been better.

0143113100|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Doodle writes about the fascinating brain, which affects every single one of us (like it or not!) in a way that is easy for a layperson to understand and enjoy. He makes it very clear how our brains are dynamic structures, at every age. Years ago most of us were taught the opposite and therefore believed we were stuck with our patterns of thought and behavior. Now we understand more about recovering from a stroke or brain injury as well as modifying ingrained habits and patterns of thinking. This book gave me hope, and some sense of empowerment over my aging brain! Pair this read with &#34;Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain&#34;<br />by John J. Ratey, Eric Hagerman (With)

B008JFUS0U|4.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that I was quite fond of the original \\"Thor\\" from 2011.  Like that movie, the scenes created here for the various non-Earth worlds have some spectacular CGI effects.  And like that movie, the most interesting events are on Earth.  This story picks up after \\"The Avengers\\" but makes references back to Asgard, Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) home planet.<br /><br />Thousands of years earlier, Thor's granddaddy defeated an evil empire (Dark Elves) that was built on destruction of all the planets, er... realms.  The Elves leader at the time, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and a few of his top lieutenants, survived but were put in a state of deep sleep.<br /><br />A key ingredient to creating undefeatable power is a wispy red vapor known as the Aether.  Skip ahead a few millennial back to planet Earth.  Thor's human girlfriend, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) hasn't seen the hunky dude for 2 years as he's trying to bring and everlasting peace to the 9 realms.  Jane and her sidekicks Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Ian (Jonathan Howard) get a tip on an unusual phenomenon at an abandon warehouse.  It turns out, it's the Aether.  How coincidental.<br /><br />So as Thor is bringing a lasting peace, Jane unleashes the Aether which sends a signal of sort to the sleeping Malekith and here we go again.  It's hard enough to keep up with all the various realms, characters and places as it is, so I don't usually get too critical of plot disconnects.  Still I couldn't understand how the father of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) could wipe out the Dark Elves thousands of years earlier, yet when revived, the small group, even without the Aether, seemed to be able to kick Asgardian ass.  Wouldn't Asgard have developed better weapons and defenses during all those centuries?<br /><br />Ultimately the film looks great.  Hemsworth and Portman have a nice chemistry between them even if they never really hook up beyond a few smooches.  Hopkins' Odin is appropriately regal with his gold eye patch and neatly trimmed white beard.  Rene Russo as Thor's mom, Frigga gets a couple nice scenes including cool sword fighting.  Ultimately, the best thing here is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the bad-boy adopted brother of Thor.  Sentence to life in prison, Loki is released by Thor on the promise that he would help fight Malekith.  He's fun to watch and gets some good lines.  \\"The Dark World\\" is fine entertainment almost up to the measure of the original.  For some viewers it will seem like more of the same, for others that's exactly what they want.ooches.  Hopkins' Odin is appropriately regal with his gold eye patch and neatly trimmed white beard.

B00G32OER4|5.0|Great movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Super cast and over well written movie, I highly recommend it.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|For me this was a scary book. I kept wanting to stop reading it as the reality described seems so close to the world we live in. \\"Privacy is theft\\" says the main character, Mae Holland, as she agrees to wear a camera that would bring every minute of her life online, for the whole world to see and, more importantly, to comment on.<br />Big Brother is nothing compared to what the Circle (a global company reaching to all layers of economy) wants for our future: total disclosure, total community and communion, no intimacy, no government, in the end...total control.<br />And the really sad part is the characters are willing participants in creating this world of utter tyranny, fooling themselves they can create the perfect world (leaving out uncertainties, mystery, solitude and replacing them with large quantities of raw data, surveys and virtual shallow interaction).
B0002TT0NW|4.0|What else need be said. Speaking only to the mature set: you can watch this one with almost the same pleasure as the younger and older sets. It is a fine family movie, colorful, action-filled, and generally interesting. Not up to the two previous one but still good vireing.
B000001EG6|5.0|Believe it or not, in the early 70's singer-songwriter era Elton John was being compared to the likes of James Taylor by music critics. Paul Buckmasters' ornate arrangements enhance this recording.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I started this book with the expectation that it would be Malala's story, but the first half was mostly about her family history and Pakistan's history with the Taliban. I got bogged down with the details but once into the second half of the book I realized that a history made sense to understand more of what happened to her and what she was fighting for. Malala is a very bright young lady and I wish her a life of health and hopefully she will someday realize her dream of education for everyone in the world.<br />After reading an article in the paper last week regarding the killing of the head of the Taliban by drone and the one replacing him was the one that gave the order to kill her, it will be a story that will continue. Malala, stay safe!

1609611543|5.0|This book sure opened my eyes to what is wrong with the American diet! I always suspected there was more to the obesity problem than just eating to much, and this book proves it. My wife and I have both been eating wheat free for about four months and it has made a substantial difference. I have had blood sugar dips (similar to hypoglycemia) most of my life. Since I began eating wheat free, I have not experienced a single occurance. I have also lost about 12 pounds. My wife's health has also improved considereably. She was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome about 6 years ago, and has had trouble keeping the weight off due to the medications she has to take. Since she began to eat wheat free she has lost about 18 pounds and coughs less as well . She says she also notices less muscle and joint ache. I have used some of the recipes in the book and found others online. I plan to order the Wheat Free Cookbook soon. Thanks for a life changing book.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|If nothing else a Lady Gaga release must contain 3 things: 1. Hype. 2. Musical Hooks and 3. a indulgence to become an spectacle of an arrival. In these three things ARTPOP succeeds brilliantly. As far as it being successful as a marriage of Art and Pop as it was hyped, or even just a solid pop album by itself, it doesn't quite reach those same stratospheric heights she hit with her previous album, the masterpiece Born This Way. But it does stand on its own as a good if not great set of songs, with a full show of ups and downs.<br /><br />This is not Born This Way II, either in sound or theme. Whereas the last album centered on identity, freedom and everything overreaching but world peace itself, this album is much more \\"sex drugs and rock and roll,\\" without the rock and roll, as this is an EDM dance album compared with \\"Born's\\" retro-yet-modern 80's and 90's rock glitz. It still works but it may be a generational opinion issue. I'm not as prone to get out and dance as I am to revel in a more retro rock sound. Kids today...;)<br /><br />As it is, the album has some highlights even unto itself. First single and album closer \\"Applause\\", which is more jarring than digestible at first, after repeated listenings will have your inner dancer making the moves to the limelight for you before you're even aware of it. It does a better job of this than some of the less accessible tracks, though they will ultimately win you over. Those included are the EDM break heavy \\"Swine,\\" (which is actually my second favorite song off the album), and Gaga-written and produced \\"Venus,\\" which at least attempts a bit of soothing in between its own electronica. Meanwhile other songs that fall for better or worse into the same category of \\"good cuts\\" but not yet album highlights such as \\"MANiCURE\\", \\"G.U.Y.\\", \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" and \\"Aura\\" further the dance storm. Yet they all have those hooks that Gaga undeniably knows how to weave into (almost, more on that) every song she's birthed.<br /><br />Additionally the title track, \\"Dope\\", and \\"Do What U Want\\" have been given a smoother hand and as such also enjoy being highlights. Indeed \\"Dope\\" employs nothing but Gaga and a piano and some minimal production.  But perhaps the albums best moment (and not surprisingly the one that sounds most like a lost \\"Born\\" cut) is Gypsy, which is the closest to an arena \\"hands in the hair\\" moment as you'll find here. Plenty of musical hooks in this group as well.<br /><br />If only the album had been kept at these 11 songs. But sadly it was not. Fashion! Donatella and Mary Jane Holland are songs that like much of the album contain a fury of electronica, but something just seems sadly lacking and one gets lost between all three of them. Unfortunately they are also back to back to back as well, which does not help to distinguish them from one another or even from what one would hear after the 2:30 last call after a drunken club night. Trust me I've been there, and the songs just aren't memorable. Even worse is her foray into rap with \\"Jewels & Drugs,\\" which, there is no kind way to say, is a mess of a song that does not belong here at all. Even the F-D-MJH mess is at least in the same vein of music and may have even had a couple of hooks somewhere in the 12 minute cacophony. \\"J&D\\" is just a bad, bad song, with no hooks for its saving grace at all.<br /><br />So art? No. Just music. I'm not even entirely sure it's POP music as opposed to a EDM album with a handful of pop songs.  Not entirely bad music but not the supernova event that it was hyped to be. Not that one should really have ever thought it would be anyways.<br /><br />Prime 5 Cuts: Gypsy, Applause, Swine, ARTPOP, Do What U Want

B002LVVCQM|4.0|The way you see The Greatest Show on Earth when you set it down may depend greatly upon the way you see it when you pick it up. As I'm sure most are aware, Dawkins doesn't do \\"fair and balanced,\\" and it's this polemical quality that both gives the book its punch and prevents me from giving it five stars. Just like you would expect given the title, The Greatest Show on Earth will sweep you off your feet and send you far and wide to see the machinery of life in action, from the fantastically simple yet counter-intuitive development of embryos to the distribution of similar species across the globe in places you might not expect. If you're already convinced that evolution is, in fact, the greatest show on earth, you'll almost certainly enjoy taking this trip. But if you are a creationist, it may seem more like kidnapping than spontaneous sightseeing.<br /><br /> The highlights of The Greatest Show on Earth are its chapters on the two subjects I mentioned beforehand--embroylogy and biogeography. In my younger days when I was not sufficiently educated about evolution, embryology was a field that was disproportionately slandered and misrepresented to me. As far as I knew, embryology never went past Haeckel faking his pictures and modern-day biologists desperately clinging to similarities between embryos of different species in an attempt to confirm their biases. Little did I know that the truth was so much more beautiful. Biogeography--the placement of species around the globe--is evolutionary theory's secret weapon, lost in the din of battles over the fossil record and those darned embryos but quite possibly the most compelling evidence one can bring to a non-biologist or a non-geologist. Dawkins handles both of these topics with flair and authority.<br /><br /> As mentioned before, the main downside of this book is that it might alienate those who need to hear it the most. Dawkins repeatedly compares creationists to Holocaust deniers, and rubs it in by straight-up calling them \\"history deniers\\" over and over again. I really have to admit that this is actually a very good comparison, and I wouldn't be that surprised if someone took stock of the historical and scientific professions and found that there were more legitimate historians who deny the Holocaust than there are legitimate scientists who deny evolution. But for crying out loud, why would someone use this comparison in a book that is (I assume) targeted at people who do not agree with them?<br /><br /> It's a rather serious offense for a book to fail in its primary purpose, so I must hold back my rating slightly, but fortunately Dawkins makes up for some of this defect with sheer verve. It starts off simple enough, with examples of artificial selection of canines, and then builds and builds until a complete defense of evolution has been presented from the ground up. For all its communication issues, The Greatest Show on Earth delivers some of the most compelling evidence that evolution lives up to the title Dawkins has bestowed upon it with this book.<br /><br /> One final word: you're probably better off getting a print edition if you have an older Kindle. I read the Kindle version and had to make do with grainy black-and-white photos. There are plenty of visual aids in this book that are best seen on a page or a least a higher-quality screen.

B00BW0QC8G|4.0|I really want to love this bag--the fabric seems super-durable, I love the wealth of pockets, and the padding is nice and dense. But for an average-sized girl (or a shorter guy with narrow shoulders), the fit gets uncomfortable over a while. The lumber support is placed at the lowest point, so I have to have the bag tightened as high as it will go. This wouldn't be a problem, except the fabric holding the two straps together at the top (where they come together in a \\"U\\" and attach to the bag) holds the straps too far apart for my shoulders and rubs at the back of my neck. I wish they had shorter versions for girls, but girl backpacks usually aren't utilitarian enough (padding, compartments) and come in garish colors.<br /><br />I don't want to dock more stars, because it's a great product otherwise.<br />+The bottom padding in the laptop compartment seems sufficient, although I keep my laptop in a sleeve before putting it in the backpack anyway<br />+I love the lumbar storage, as this is the handiest place to keep your phone so you can feel it buzz when you're on the go in a noisy area<br />+Zippered compartments in the main storage areas are great for smaller items that like to tumble around<br />+Zippers only come down midway; laptop compartment only opens enough to accommodate a very fat laptop. I absolutely hate it when zippers go all the way down, so a heavy book can push the front flap open and everything falls out (issue with my last pack :/).<br />+Very durable material. The trade-off is that it doesn't have much give. Also gives it a very structured shape, but again that trade-off is that since it's a tall but relatively narrow rectangle, it's prone to tipping forward when sitting down (or tumbling off the front seat when the stupid driver in front of you causes you to brake suddenly).<br />+Diversity of pockets (placement, number, size, shape, etc) is great for those of us who are control freaks about where every last thing should go<br /><br />-Straps could have more padding, and get rid of the middle fabric at the very top.<br />-Since the bag is so tall, many of the compartments are bottomless pits. Even the pocket for an mp3 player is super deep (and I know my Zune is one of the biggest mp3 players on the market).<br /><br />I also wanted to give props to CaseLogic for putting together super detailed videos that show almost every aspect of their backpacks.<br /><br />Update: been using this for three months now. It's holding up very well; shoulder straps are still annoying but I just have to keep adjusting them. I ordered an Adidas backpack to see if I should replace the Caselogic, since I used to have one of Adidas' backpacks with the Load-Spring straps (those are the comfiest things ever!) However, after loading up the new backpack, it's pretty clear that I won't be able to stand not having all of the pockets the Caselogic has. If they put the Load-Spring straps on this Caselogic, it'd be 5 stars easy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is truly the best way to spend a few hours. Once you start playing you won't want to quit. There is a problem with it though. If you aren't on Facebook you will only get to a certain level and then you will have to pay to go any further. However; it is still fun.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|It's a very nice app. I got it as the &#34;free app of the day&#34;. I was never very good at physics, but this was fun to play with, building rocket ships and such. It is rather time consuming when learning all the controls and how things work. But I'm sure once you get the hang of it, it is even more fun.<br />It's a great app if you like creating rocket ships and seeing how far they go, sending then into orbit, etc.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I know this is more expensive than what you find in the store but I was so sick of replacing my utensils so often because their edges were melting. I love using these they're the perfect amount of give and take ( bend and stiffness ) I never thought I would need the elevate feature but it is nice ( my spoon almost never gets used anymore ) I have had them for 3 months which isn't terribly long but they look brand new and help me with all my cooking needs.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|After one hour of being bored to death the movie came to life so the last 35 minutes were good but not the best that's why I only gave it three stars.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Going into this book, I wasn't really sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.  The follow-up with little Danny Torrance (now not so little) with other craziness built in -- and done well -- was great.  I had no idea Mr. King was even working on this (shame on me) and it certainly took me back to &#34;The Shining&#34; and served as a reminder of the book itself (not the movie -- which frankly, did nothing for this constant reader) needs to revisited asap!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This is a somewhat typical, but generally entertaining free floor escape game. The app currently consists of nine different levels (according to the app store, more levels are planned), and you must figure out how to access the elevator on each floor to get from one floor to another. The puzzles get more intricate the further into the game you go, however, for the most part, they all consist of finding the correct codes to unlock key area in the puzzle. There are relatively few items you can pick up and manipulate in the game, and the use for each item is usually fairly obvious. Playing the game straight through will take about an hour for most people.<br /><br />The game has a couple of drawbacks. You can't save the game in the middle of a floor... exit and you start the floor all over again. As usual, the game contains a fair number of ads, but once you start playing a floor, they aren't obtrusive. Plus, there are no hints or clues available. Still, fans of this genre should be able to figure the various puzzles out fairly quickly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome because you just have the temptation to keep on getting to the next level. This game is addicting to play because you just want to get to the next level and the end of the game. It is so exciting because you won't know what happens next.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Its a great game for all ages but has some loading issues. The kids love this game and I do too.
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|Difficult to see on smaller devices like kindle which is the main thing I use for games when I'm not reading of course!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best games I've ever played. Totally entertaining.  I don't have anything negative to say about this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I totaly recomend it. It's like you aktualy have a horse but on a tablet. But you only have 3 gems at the start so just don't waste them so quickly! But I do recomend if you want this game and/or you love animals.
B005LAIH2C|1.0|I knew his wasn't going to be a great movie, but it was much worse than I thought. I expected Hansel & Gretel to be an actioner comparable to Van Helsing or Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, but those look like masterpieces (they aren't) next to this stinker. This really isn't the showcase for Jeremy Renner which I'm sure he'd hoped it would be. The story starts like the classic fairy tale, but after they escape, Hansel and Gretel begin a career stalking and killing witches. There's a central story thread about trying to learn the true fate of their parents, who dissappeared the night they where rushed from their home by their father and ended up wandering into the witch's candy house. The whole thing is rather convoluted and not very memorable. Much of the time in the action scenes, it's much too dark to see what is going on. They didn't even try to establish accents for these supposedly European characters or make any effort to forgo modern attitudes for the leads. There's a character who is not what she appears to be, but I guessed her secret very quickly.  And somebody must have thought they were being terribly clever by casting Famke Janson, who is a very beautiful woman, as the lead witch. Fortunately, you do get to see her without the witch makeup part of the time. I've already wasted way too much of my life on this film, so I'll wrap this up by advising you to skip it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I have become a real &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; junkie.  I love the stories and characters.  It is real good mind candy.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Amazing read. Inspiring, informing beautiful story telling. Deeply researched with so much history and culture I finished this book and had a brand new outlook on life
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book is really good. I look forward to the rest of the series. John Grisham has did it again!
B00CIS1OKW|2.0|I did not care for this movie. The effects were mediocre and the plot was worse. The story had potential, but this is not a movie I will be watching again.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|The Ultimate Bourne Collection It´s Ok. The Box and the Blu-ray are very good!!! Thank you very much. I´ liked.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Fantastic book. If you liked the movie, you will like the book as well. The style, written in first petition from an unnamed protagonist, is different from most other books I've read, it really pulls you into the story.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|American Horror Story: Asylum are complete, the box and the blu-ray are excellent. Liked, are very good. Thank you very much.
1583334386|5.0|The first few chapters were enough to make a positive, lasting impact. I'll return to this book again and again.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I love the songs and the singer. But I have to listen on my bose radio because I do not have cloud on my samsung tablet and can not play it on there.
B00F031XPS|3.0|I'm a longtime JH fan and have a large collection of his music.  This documentary was alright, nothing really stood out.  Solid footage of him jamming.  I was hoping for more information surrounding his death and all the legal mess afterwards.  All of a sudden it just ended, left me wanting more.  Better stuff is out there for sure.  I really thought West Coast Seattle Boy was much better.  Jimi was like a great fire that burned out way to soon.  He was way ahead of his time and his death was tragic.  I can only imagine the music he would have given the world had he lived.  I kind of think he would have made his way to Memphis to play the Blues, that was his love.  Enjoy what he gave us, he was a master.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|BEST one yet Big Fish. Wish the sequel was here now. These guys out did themselves this time story line was great. The ending did not leave me hanging or disappointed.
055357342X|5.0|As the HBO show gains popularity the book series has come to the attention of many fantasy and non-fantasy readers alike.  A Storm of Swords is the third installment of what is to be a seven part series called A Song of Ice and Fire.  For the most part, the HBO series has followed each book fairly well and has made a season out of each book.  This time around, however, the HBO series falls perilously short by a couple hundred pages.  So, for those of you who do not want to know what will occur before the series, I advise you to read only just over half of the book or not at all if you don't think you can stop yourself.  Because, as you can imagine, the plot thickens.<br /><br />War rages in Westeros and several kings vie to make themselves known, loved, and feared to gain or keep the Iron Throne.  The deception of the Lannisters spreads like wildfire and the threat of the wildlings and the Others beyond the Wall becomes increasingly interesting.  Although Martin very often only describes battles after the fact, he delves into them a bit more in this book.  Deaths occur and those that survive become more and more interesting to replace those that are lost.  While Westeros is in turmoil, Daenerys continues on her mission with her dragons to attain the power and necessary means to return to Westeros.<br /><br />It's a long haul, as are the other books in the series, but the incredible fullness of the work is akin to just how full and alive this world is for Martin and for his readers.  No characters are overlooked and no places are shirked from mention.  This world's history is as alive and as complicated as reality and, therefore, can be long winded.  However, the skill in which Martin weaves his tale keeps the reader engaged.<br /><br />Another great read, and worth the space on anyone's shelf.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I failed to find Clash Of Clans, but this is a great replacement on the app store.<br />A very addicting game.<br />I enjoy the in-game timing, such as building, as it isn't too fast to fly through the game, but can be left and completed on returning a while later.<br />It has a satisfying development and achievement reward as you upgrade and complete goals.<br /><br />Overall, this game is 'top quality' and one of the best free games on the Amazon appstore. I haven't found any major cons either.
B00F8LPH90|3.0|The app is okay but there are glitches. I don't like the lack of weapons upgrades and they seem to add little to efficiency once you purchase to the max .
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think this book was great I can't wait to read the next book l hope that the next book is good
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Plot is dragging so far. Main develeoped characters have been &#34;killed off&#34; or kicked out of the group. I hope it picks up soon but so far it gets 3 from me. Still gonna be watching though.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|There are many other notetaking for the Cloud, but I may not ever find out about them.  The truth is that Evernote got so much right in their design that I have dozens of notes and dozens of folders and it's become a part of my daily workflow.  When I need to remember something, I know it's on my desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone any time I need it.<br /><br />I've showed Evernote to several people and the initial response is, &#34;Well, is that all it does?&#34;  You have to try it out and then you'll be sold on its usefulness and wonder why you didn't use it sooner.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|This is a new concept and worth watching. I found myself fast forwarding 2/3 of the way through because it started dragging but Im impatient when it comes to that. The movie picks back up and has a nice ending. A great movie for a rainy day.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Not to be missed. Fills in some background about Harry that any regular reader of these excellent books will appreciate.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters really came to life in this well written novel.  This was the first book that I read by Liane Moriarty. I love the way she makes her story so real.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Nothing new to say but just wanted to add my voice to say I loved it.  I so agree with the reviewer who said it was Sheldon of Big Bang Theory.  I broke my rule of never paying for than $3.99 for a Kindle book by buying it, and read it in one night.  Totally worth it!
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|It didn't work and I have lots of storage on my kindle and it said it was downloading then it just froze for like 12 min
B00371XIJE|5.0|This story is so touching. So beautiful, yet so depressing. I cried badly near the end. Perhaps wishing that there's someone as loyal as hachi in my life as well :(. Don't watch it if you don't want to cry. But if you do and have feelings, go ahead because it will touch your heart, your soul and your deep emotions that are hidden inside of you. I had a dog before and was loyal too. 2nd time watching this movie after years. Still the best drama interesting true story ever.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game to fill in your spare time.  Only just started the game but it keeps you interested with all the different stages
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Its almost impossible to advance in the game without paying ransom to buy the cheats needed to progress.  I would rather pay to own the game than have to pay for the &quot;privilege&quot; to play it.
B005IT0V8O|1.0|I found the sentences were all jumbled up on my Kindle for PC. I am not sure what caused the jumble. Other reviewers found a similar jumble. But some found the book OK. I am not sure what is happening, but you should be cautious. Although, considering the price, you have nothing to lose. I will try the 99 cent version.
0767020308|4.0|This adaptation is much more faithful to the book than the one with Romola Garai, and the casting is better than the one with Gwyneth Paltrow.  I had to watch if a few times to really appreciate it, and the scenes where Emma imagines Harriet's future took a while to grow on me.  I tend to be irritated by casting that doesn't fit the descriptions of characters in books, so that can really affect how well I like a movie on the first viewing.<br /><br />From watching previous movies of Emma, I had it in my head for her to be blonde [I think I saw clips of the Paltrow version before ever actually reading the book], but apparently apart from saying she has hazel eyes, Austen never gave much of a physical description of the character.  The casting of the Westons is perfect, and most of the other supporting characters as well, though I have trouble with Hepton as the silly Mr. Woodhouse, after he played such a stern Sir Thomas Bertram in the old BBC \\"Mansfield Park.\\"<br /><br />The casting of Toni Collette as Harriet in the Paltrow \\"Emma\\" absolutely ruined the movie for me, but Harriet in this one is pretty well portrayed.  Emma and Harriet should probably look a bit younger than they do, but still, it works for me.<br /><br />The ending they contrived for this movie is lovely - a big harvest gathering at Donwell Abbey.  Austen tends to end her stories with a lot of rambling observations and events, but not so much ending \\"scenes.\\"  This leaves movie makers with having to come up with something to wrap up the story, and this one is wonderful.<br /><br />Though I still like the old BBC version of this story best, since it's much longer and is more inclusive of the material from the book, this is my next favorite.  If you just find it so-so on the first viewing, give it another shot.  It really is quite well done.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|Not much useful information in this app.  Confusing when setting up and the directions are non-existent.  Prefer Weather Channel app.

B00992CF6W|1.0|People have rated Minecraft PE at 1 star just because they didn't get an update. You need to be PATIENT for the updates!! The programmers have to rewrite the Minecraft PE code to match the Kindle's code. Its way different from the iOS code.<br /><br />The only reason Apple gets the update first is because they pay<br />A LOT more than Amazon does to get the update first.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|And a very, witty, clever, enjoyable pack of lies at that. Read and you'll know Locke's genius, triumphs, sorrows, loves, and rage. You'll be better for it.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Just like the previous two books in the Mistborn series this book is absolutely amazing. From the story twists to the realizations that everything you thought you knew was wrong, the book kept me hooked from front to back. Pick this book up now, you won't regret it.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|This is another app that I put on my phone for my granddaughter.  She really likes to play on it.  She also uses her imagination.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|What a fantastically written novel. To think of how life's twists and turns ultimately affect who you become is so intriguing. Highly recommended read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it needs to b free please I have no money please monjang I beg u XD purrty please he he he he
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game is fun and fast paced and exciting. The gun layout is a little boring though and there is a lot of blood when you kill the animal not to mention that you can't get anywhere without glu credits which you have to buy with real money.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book.  The &#34;secret&#34; was certainly not what I expected.  The ending of the book put everything into perspective and made the realize just how much lives can be changed by life's events.  This was the first book I read by this author, but II will definitely read more of Liane Moriarty's novels.
0240815807|5.0|I am generally not given to raving about something unless I considering it deserving. This book gets the \\"Most Valuable Book\\" award! Hands down the most informative book on home recording I have ever read. Mixes went from 'eh,close' to spot ON! I can't say enough good things about Mike Senior and the wealth of knowledge he imparts here. Thank you, Mike. VERY much.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Amazing Movie!!!<br />Very good movie! enjoyed every minute of it! I would recommend this movie for everyone! Jennifer was outstanding in the movie!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Well it's entertaining thats for sure, it is a good movie , action that is. The story line is a bit dull, i did enjoy but wouldn't buy the dvd. Over all was good, enjoyed, entertained, need i say more, no.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I love this movie, I love independent films anyway.  Love the lead singer of Gorgel Bordello Ukrainian gypsy band that played the lead in this movie.  I also love Elijah Wood in this.  Very good screen play , story, etc.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Bought this ALBUM when it came out new in 1967 or so. Saw them play much of it live, in Detroit. Fantastic group of musicians. Love them. Rest in Peace, Carl Wilson.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This is another great book in a great series. It has an awsome world and magic system, great characters and more action than you can shalke a stick at.
B00701QV0A|4.0|Bought this album when it first came out in the 80's???  Great stuff!  Love the Eye in the Sky stuff.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|If you like fantasy novels you need to read this entire series. The book is great and has everything you could want, well-developed world, unique magic system and characters you care about.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Mostly held my attention but seemed hurried at times. Overall good, though.  Wish he had developed Valentine and Peter characters with more detail.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a great book, if a bit long. The characters are interesting and the world is intriguing. The only down point is the constant switching between characters. just as you really hit your stride with one part the author switches to the other thread.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Reading the last book in this series was akin to buying all the yummy ingredients to baking a cake,  placing it in tho oven, waiting impatiently for the oven timer to go off with a ding ! ....only for the cake to come out of the oven completely deflated. That's how I felt when I read this book.<br /><br />I got hooked on the first of this series, Divergent, with the concept of the factions and excellent character development of Tris and Four.  I felt they were multi dimensional and not your typical badass YA heroine and hero. I was shocked at who the author decided to kill off in the first book but took it stride due to the journey that I anticipated Tris would need to travel.<br /><br />Well, after reading this last of the series, the word I would choose would be: betrayed. I did not care for the choice to alternate voices between Tris and Four so quickly from one chapter to the next...I did not like the Big a Brother twist nor the focus on the GP vs. GD after all the time invested in the Factions and Factionless.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, read the book for closure. Read the book since you've waited so long from the initial book,Divergent. But start the book knowing you  may just walk away feeling like the air was let out of a balloon...
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|AMAZING ALBUM. I cannot stop listening to this album! They're all single worthy She needs to at least release 5 from this album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will have you crying and laughing at the same time. I thought this was one of the best stories I have ever read.<br />I cannot wait to share this with my daughter. I would recommend this book to everyone!!
0525478817|5.0|It was a true love story cute but sad but it was worth the tears this book took it was one of the best books I have ever read!!!
B000T5O48U|5.0|Cujo is one of the movies that established Stephen King's name not only as a writer, but as a force in Hollywood as well. Cujo is a classic 80's-style horror movie about a grimly realistic scenario. Up to that point, the King brand was known mainly for Carrie, Salem's Lot, and The Shining, stories about special powers and evil, paranormal creatures. In Cujo, we get a story about two people trapped in a car with a huge, vicious, rabid dog outside and no way to get help. The movie does a perfect job of making the viewer feel the claustrophobic terror that Donna and her young son Tad experience while trapped in mechanic Joe Camber's driveway in a broken-down car out in the middle of nowhere. Camber's been killed by the dog, mail service has been put on hold since Camber was supposed to have gone out of town, Donna's husband is on a business trip, and the one cop who comes to check if she's there gets killed by the dog. Donna and Tad slowly dehydrate from the lack of water and sweltering temperature, and the dog just won't give up on its goal of having them both for dinner. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro deliver amazing performances as the lead characters, making the terrible situation much more believable with their portrayal of terror and hopeless frustration. The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD has some great documentaries about the making of the movie, including how they got the dogs (yes, plural) to do all of the attacking, which offers some insight into the &#34;movie magic&#34; behind those terrifying scenes. Overall, Cujo is one of the strongest adaptations of Stephen King's work and one of my favorite movies based on his writing.
1423113462|5.0|If you loved the series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, you will love this book, which kicks off the next series.  Weaves both Greek and Roman mythology into the modern day in Riordan's humorous style.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The characters in this book are quite memorable.  I would have liked to have read about the rest of the girl's story, before she died.
B002QP145C|5.0|This is Finland's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\". The perfect mixture of storytelling and battle scenes. The characters can be related to no matter what language the speak or what country they are from.
0345803485|5.0|Ugh!  I have an advanced degree in English Literature, as well as a J.D.  and I cannot believe I allowed myself to read this trash. Well aware of the hype surrounding the Fifty Shades phenomenon, I had no intention to succumb to the \\"mommy porn\\" craze.  However, one crisp autumn day, I found myself searching for an easy under-the-cashmere-blanket-with-a-glass-of-red-wine novel et voila! I bought Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One.<br /><br />Full disclosure:  This is horrible, lazy writing. If you you have an respect for the English language, whatsoever, you will notice all sorts of hideous mistakes.  There is also an insane amount of cliché and bathos.<br /><br />That said, I couldn't put it down. It is as addicting as cheesy puffs or Doritos and I (shamefully) will be purchasing Book Two.
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|We purchased this mic to record live piano performance with Nikon D5100 Camera.  For a $200 plus &#34;professional grade&#34; mic, we would expect very good sound recording quality. however, I  can not tell much difference in sound quality compared with recordings taken with camera's build in mic. Still a good mic, Just don't think it worth the high price tag.
B0030DIP7O|5.0|I love these &#34;Original Album Classics&#34; releases.<br /><br />I haven't listened to any Scorpions in a long time. These 3 early records are a document of the sound that would be the foundation for the commercially huge later releases.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set. It's a great price, and the original mastering that is normally found on these collections is fantastic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game that I can't stop playing! I thought it would be like temple run so it might be boring but it's fun.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|The extended and additional scenes improve the movie and the appendices are entertaining. I am disappointed by the package (it looks boring and cheap next to the LoTR extended editions) and there is only one commentary (unlike the four for each of the LoTR extended editions).<br /><br />A much better purchase than the regular edition, but a letdown when placed side-by-side with the previous trilogy's extended editions.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's my first DVD with Jillian Michaels. It's very challenging and shapes up your body. After each exercice I really feel that my entire body works hard. I did not use to exercice so at first I was very very sore. This DVD is very effective and after 1 month I feel that my body has shaped up. Only after 3 weeks I started the level 2 and it was very challenging. I believe level one is still challenging whenever I want to switch back to it. Not yet up to level 3. But the results are so motivating and it feels so good at the end of each workout that although it is challenging I keep doing it every day. Really worth a try.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I've read other Lehane books and never have been blown away. Shutter Island, on the other hand, seems flawless. The dialogue between characters is believable and witty. The plotting is not exactly break-necked pace, but it does seem perfectly paced for the overall feel of the novel. The greatest attribute of the book, however, is its mood. Every word contributes to it. While the language is sometimes harsh, it also serves to preserve the mood. I loved this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for all ages. Teaches how to take care of your horse. My niece and I love to play together. She is 4 and I am 40. We have lots of fun.

B00FFRAKRG|5.0|I'm a huge KoRn fan. I have been a huge fan since '98. They completely changed the way I view life. It's been fun to see Jon become a happier person through their songs. Korn has kind of morphed its sound to something different. Sometimes change is good. I will say, though, that you can definitely tell that Head's back. Amazing guitarist!<br /><br />Some of my favorite tracks are #1, #2, #3, #4, & #9.

B004U7JYXS|5.0|The film is really easy to load in to the camera and it's pretty quick to develop. The pictures aren't as small as I thought they would be. They're the size of a credit card which is pretty decent for such a small camera. I bought the camera and film for a guest book and it's perfect. They're just fun, instant pictures. If you want really, super high quality photos, I don't know if this is exactly the film for you. If you're just looking for fun film, this is it! The pricing isn't' too bad either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game.  It isn't too hard you just have to pay attention.<br />I use these games to. unwind after working all day.  Oh yeah the price<br />is right!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|These movies encapsulate what Pixar is all about.  I believe that every movie in this series is better than the last.  A must-own for lovers of Disney and great animated films!
B008J8KBKY|2.0|the game seems interesting at first. Then I found it very confusing and I just didn't enjoy it I'm not big into playing games on the phone so I don't want to say it's the game that's why I said maybe it's me.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This is my favorite of the TNG movies.  I really enjoyed the time travel elements, plus, the Borg are a great set of enemies for the Enterprise crew.
B00G4NUQYM|4.0|This is a great game for cross word puzzle lovers.. of which I am one.  I enjoy playing this game with my kids too... it helps with their vocabulary  ans spelling.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My son loves this movie watches it over and over and over I have it down loaded on all my devices
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Great coming of age story with poignant, sincere performances. Matthew McConaughey redeems himself in his performance in this film, after his starring role in the horrendously bad Killer Joe. I've never thought that much of him as an actor, but he is great in this movie. Jeff Nichols has produced another winner, like his previous Take Shelter and other fine films. The child actors are also excellent. Highly recommended for family viewing, for kids 12 and older.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Awesome love the show and the actors fit the roles perfect story line is fantastic but please bring Bonnie back
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Every character and situation was so full of rollicking fun that it made me burst out laughing. I recommend it.
B00EJX2YGM|2.0|It's frustrating pulling the disc's out of the box.  They scratch very easily.  Just got them yesterday and 2 disc's are already scratched. Wish it was a hard dvd case.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Not one of her best books :(  I have read all her books and this was by far the most boring
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game. I spend hours trying to beat my own times. I have tried other Mahjong games and was disappointed with them compared to this one.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is such a wonderful book.  The author develops the characters so much you fell like you really know them.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The book is fantastic. Even though I didn't read the first books the story was easy to understand. I recommend it
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love dungeon hunter 3, but 4 is a whole new world of cool. It has a much better story, graphics, skills, characters, imagery, and its free! Fantastic game I know you will,love it as I do. I'm impressed and addicted and I've only played for 2 days.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game!!! The graphics are good and I like how there are robots from the movie. Greatly unexpected for a game that is free.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Was in bed with a terrible cold and found this app.  Took my mind away from my \\"ills\\" and helped a miserable time go by.
B009B4XSKK|5.0|Awesome music, great beat and has haunting melodies.  Love it. Recommend all Placebo fans purchase this album. Perfect gift too.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|Ok, first off I did like this game, could have been better.  I liked the three dimensional aspect of the game. It was pretty cool and its free so you won't lose anything if you don't like it, you can just uninstall it!!<br /><br />Secondly, just because a game is too hard for you to do, doesn't mean you should diss it because of that. Its not the game's fault, nor the creators.<br /><br />And Thirdly, you do not rate a game by the fact of if it has ads or not, you could comment about it, but that shouldn't be the basis of your whole review.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Hot Hot Hot.  this album rocks, Rihanna lays it all out and holds nothing back. Fantastic beat and my Daughter loves it. Great for working out to.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this classic.  I have read it multiple times, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read classic literature.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is probably the 15th best game i played besides the dark knight.<br /><br />This game is from the same maker as the dark knight.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This cd is pure gold! I am so happy I pre-ordered it-its her sound, made better. And \\"Bad Girl\\" I believe is a huge jump, and she did it well! Never have I heard something like that out of a mainstream artist.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with books one and two, Mockingjay (the final book of The Hunger Games trilogy) did not disappoint. The story picks up where book two ended. Katniss being sheltered in District 13, her actions inspiring the other districts' struggle for freedom and their uniting to launch the rebel attack on the Capitol.  Suzanne Collins is a talented writer/story-teller. Her books quickly suck you in and keep you reading to find out what is going to happen next.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I had this game on my phone, glad to hear that there is a kindle version and its free. Can't wait for the updates.
0152023984|5.0|This English translation of the book is amazing.  I think that out of all the translations out there this is the one that &#34;read/felt&#34; the closest to the original French version.
B002CMQS1O|5.0|No matter how many times i watch it, spinal tap still cracks me up.  Such a fine line between stupid and clever.
1400049628|4.0|Although I haven't finished reading this book I find how it takes itself seriously (in mockery of course) pretty entertaining.
B00GLMQREE|4.0|I missed this episode when it aired on TV, so I came to Amazon Prime to recap.  Well, it was fantastic.  I'm so glad I was able to stream it and see the entire episode sans commercials or other interruptions.  This is a great benefit.  This episode had a lot of emotional twists and turns.  For a moment, I was afraid that the writers would really let Glen die or have the prison compound completely overrun by walkers.  Herschel is going through inner turmoil that I'm sure many viewers could relate to and the relationship adjustments between Carl and Rick are almost palpable.  Actually, it is the relationships that keep this story line interesting as well as the individual characters.  I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to see the interaction between Rick and Daryl about the reason for Carol's disappearance.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Showed this to an inner-city high school French class I was subbing for and they absolutely loved it! Awesome characters...
B005EGXTEE|4.0|There is no doubt that The Hunger Games is a well-written book. It has strong characters and an inventive storyline which is told at a hectic pace. The book is, at times, brutal in its portrayal of a world gone mad where teenagers fight to the death in hope of bringing their home regions some prosperity. Although I did enjoy reading this book, I couldn't help but be angered by this sick world (but maybe that's the whole idea).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I continue to read every book King writes, but Doctor Sleep clearly ranks with some of the best. I enjoyed much of 11/22/63, but found it a little long and felt that King wrote himself into a corner to come up with an ending. Doctor Sleep doesn't suffer from this! As his first true sequel, he re-introduces Danny Torrance from The Shining, showing how one of his characters had to deal with the results of the horrors depicted in the earlier novel.<br /><br />I don't want to see him bring back other characters from prior novels, but I am definitely glad he did this time!
B003UYUP6M|5.0|As Google marches on towards its ultimate goal of world domination, it's interesting to find out how it all began. The book is very well written and manages to present sometimes complex information in a enjoyably readable fashion. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the world of Google and how they keep their mighty data machine going (and how they make their squillions).
1594484805|4.0|Daniel Pink researched what motivates people.  His findings are that people must be paid well and be able to take care of their needs and their family's needs, yet after that, money is not a big motivator and can actually be a detractor.<br /><br />Pink demonstrates that the keys are:<br />* Intrinsic Motivation (discussed the book \\"Flow\\" frequently)<br />* Ability to be creative in aspects of work<br />* Long-term thinking vs. Short-term thinking<br />* Not setting performance goals (setting goals means people set easier, attainable goals)<br /><br />It is an easy read; the reason for not 5 stars is that the book could use more substance and more how to implement in the workplace or even in one's own life.  Maybe that's the next step.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like playing this game.  I have it on my smart phone.  I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire so I could have more fun playing but I can't seem to log on to Facebook from my Kindle to ask friends for help or any thing.  I've  tried  twice  to download this game but without success.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I can't give a full review because I couldn't commit to playing more than 15 minutes of this game.<br /><br />I enjoy classic horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil and was hoping for something in the same<br />style as that.<br /><br />The game plays extremely slow with very bland graphics. There is sroad with very pixelated textures and little else. The combination of this give you a limbo feeling, but not in the way you would like it to.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Absolutely Awesome ! This album is full of all the Classic Stryper Spirit! Buy it now you will not be disappointed with a single track!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|My adult daughter loves this movie, I, an adult male, liked it.  It's probably a bit more of a chic flick; however, I thought it was a great storyline as to how &#34;Cinderella&#34; could have emanated from a true story.  I think just about anybody would enjoy this movie, but definitely women a bit more than men...but remember I do like it too.  The performance by Angelica Huston as the wicked step-mother is worth the purchase price as she absolutely steals the show at the ending!  Priceless performance!
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is probably one of the best speed app that is actually fun!!! So amusing for teens and adults!
B007HO392S|5.0|Great country western album.  I loved every track and Carrie Underwood is definitely one of the best.  My wife and I often wonder why she doesn't win more awards, because we absolutely love her music.  I think you'll like this one too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this before he was tragically killed - what an American!!  I'm not really into the Army shoot 'em up kind 'thing', but this guy is (was) impressive.  Jesse Ventura should be VERY ashamed for suing his widow!!!
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|I admit it, I'm a fan of the G. I. Joe movies and have them both.  My grandkids and I watch them all the time...along with the Transformers, of course!  (Please come back Megan Fox!)  Oh, sorry, back to &#34;G.I. Joe: Retaliation,&#34; I thought it was a pretty darn good flick and my grandchildren all agree!  I'm even wearing the free, personalized dogtags!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|It totally escapes me why some authors seem inclined to use words that are unknown to 95 percent of the general public. We acknowledge your education and expertise when we purchase your tomes. The least you could do is make the READING more enjoyable and less frustrating. The story while enjoyable in parts was far fetched and ridiculous in 25 percent of the book/tome. I am not likely to purchase another written by these two.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a whole different perspective on the traditional zombie story. I'll go see the movie now.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautiful and magical. I couldn't put this book down. I found myself wondering how Leisel was during my work day when I couldn't read. I actually grew to love the characters and truly care about their story lines. The writing was lovely and perfectly worded for all the situations introduced in the book. I highly recommend this book!
B001JIFYSA|3.0|I had heard some great things about this being a &#34;must see&#34; movie. So, i was happy to rent it.  I don't know. I thought is was okay. Not must see just okay.  It sweetly contracted with charming British humor. I love Hugh so give it a go.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Story about an alcoholic flight captain who saves a broken plan from the total crash due to his flight skills. But there is still the alcohol in his blood, in his past and in his future!?
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Who couldn't love a young adult using her talents for good. Young girl has a gift of detective work … interesting storyline. I wish the show hadn't been canceled.  Love it. I'm a Marshmallow!  :D
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|Love this song and the artist!<br />What's to say, Ellie has great voice. Saw her on the Queen Latifah Show and had to have this song.
B001G50QCK|5.0|What not to love Superman in training and pre-Justice League. If you love super heroes and haven't seen Smallville, what are you waiting for?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing on my cell phone and now I can play on my Kindle Fire. I have been waiting a long time for this app.
B004SKQAJI|4.0|The original version is a much better show, in my opinion.  But since I like him and his dancing, it's a keeper.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|this is so far out there  but it makes you think about the possibilities!!  I don't believe this is real at all, except from a book.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|The levels of depth is captivating,not only is the story unfolding but the characters show their feelings as they speak.when a comment is made the writer tells of the self satisfaction or the other emotions felt by that comment.<br />This brings the emotions of the characters alive. A very clever novel beautifully written . Please excuse the lack of elegant discourse in this evaluation 3 glasses of whine can do that.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I like it very much. It was exactly what I needed at the time I downloaded it on last weekend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Legally addicted.  Bright, flashy, fast moving, challenging.  Great game for those who like puzzles.  Once you start playing, hard to stop.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Fun addicting game.  Enjoyed by all.  Fun for little kids too.  Good game.  Only problem too many pop up ads.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Enjoyed this movie with my granddaughters without fearing any types of sexual overtones.  Too many of todays &#34;kids&#34; shows have sexual content that most children may not understand but, it is still present.  Shame on Hollywood.  Disney productions aren't what they were when I was a kid.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series. You fall in love with the characters as they journey through trying times. Highly recommended for British drama lovers.
0399157573|5.0|I appreciate the detail and accuracy of the Scarpetta novels. I am only a few chapters in now and I can't put it down! So glad Scarpetta decided to keep sock!!
B00321GTJU|5.0|This is a good series.  I have not seen the whole series because it cost $1.99 per episode.  But, is a good entertaining series.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First book was an excellent read. Catching Fire was good but,left me thinking...been there done that. Felt I had to read Mocking Jay to complete the story. Again, it was repetitive, and I was glad when it ended.
0446615641|5.0|Bought this series from Baldacci after reading one while I was on deployment. I was hooked and wanted to read the other books in Camel Club so thanks to Amazon I ordered all of them used for a great price. They came in good condition.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Spent way too much time reading inane dialogue.  I understand the authors point but it could have been done in 100 pages.
0446615625|4.0|Bought this series from Baldacci after reading one while I was on deployment. I was hooked and wanted to read the other books in Camel Club so thanks to Amazon I ordered all of them used for a great price. They came in good condition.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I like Blake Shelton and this CD doesn't disappoint.  It's a good mix of upbeat and slower songs.  Just all around good listening
B0085RZGYU|4.0|Bought this series from Baldacci after reading one while I was on deployment. I was hooked and wanted to read the other books in Camel Club so thanks to Amazon I ordered all of them used for a great price. They came in good condition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I know this game is for kids, but my husband and I love this game! It is so much fun and slightly frustrating!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The movie is okay, personally. But my fiance loves it and didn't own it at the time. So I ordered it as a stocking stuffer. Happy (soon to be wife) happy life.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Great upbeat songs and music!  Some Nights caught my attention with its catchy beat, liked the words when I took the time to listen to them, bought the CD and enjoyed the rest of the music!
1451666179|3.0|Perhaps it is because of the blogger's year-long absence due to depression, but I read all of these stories with a new lens and found them to be rather sad and more like cries for help. Self-deprecating humor can be hilarious when coming from a healthy person who doesn't take themselves too seriously, but nearly all of her new material just seemed rather dark. I love the old stuff (the majority of the book's contents can already be found on her blog) and I really hope she gets the help she seeks. While I do want to support bloggers like her, I'd recommend just reading the blog and then buying some merchandise to support her and skip the book.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I bought a motherboard that used a 30mm fan to cool the chip set but came with a mount for a 40mm.  After changing out some of the case fans for Noctua quiet fans I could still hear the little 30 mm fan screaming at me; so I bought this one and the silence is wonderful
1449437524|4.0|Short but sweet and every dog lover will relate to it. We have two golden retrievers and what the author writes is spot on hilarious. Maybe not worth it unless you are seriously dog obsessed but makes a great gift for dog lovers. We bought it for our pet sitter.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Love,  love,  LOVE Eminem and love his Slim Shady persona.  This cd is great and he did NOT disappoint with this new album.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Florida Georgia Line's album is just full of good fun country music. Hit after hit, Cruise, Shine, and more ...
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have been praying and following my Divine guidance which let me to this book.  It is a wonderful inspiration and confirmation to the guidance that I received in my life so far.  This is that happiest I have ever been looking forward to the rest of my life!!!!
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|L.P. JulYThis APP needs some work. It could be more user friendly. It also frustratingly bounces in and out so you have to start your search all over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It has a lot of variety while advancing through the levels. Yes, some of them are really hard. I suggest checking out crushingcandies.com for some walkthroughs and hints on how to get through the level. It's a lot of fun. I definitely recommend getting it. :)
B0060D0XE4|4.0|Kind of campy; the adult actors were having a ball, the younger actors were pretty good. Wish they made a sequel!
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|It is a story that had to be told and should be read by everyone including the Taliban.  It displays such courage in such a young person and incredible compassion for her family.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|it a really good game. i would highly recomend it to any one who has played any online trade card game.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Of course who doesn't like Zynga games . But for now I give 3 *** Would like time to sell items to Myah without the market changing.. Would like to ship more than 10 ... need more ways to make coins to buy the things needed to finish quests I too..

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Wonderful game<br />Could not have asked for a better mystery hidden object adventure game. I was very satisfied overall with this.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love walking dead, pays respect to the Romero films and stays true to the genre. The cast is outstanding and the same for the writers.  Always suspenseful and interesting.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is so relaxing! Only problem I have with it is that it stops running all the time. But it does relax you.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This book is a failure on so many interesting levels.<br /><br />First, Donna Tartt spent over a decade writing this book.  I did the math, and that breaks down to something like a single paragraph per week.  My problem with this is that ANYONE given eleven years should be able to write a novel of substance.  Because of the rarity of her output, this novel is being heralded as an important work and a big contribution to the literary world.  I'm not sure why, however, her inability to write faster or more often somehow automatically makes the quality of that output better.  So many terrific and brilliant writers working today produce a novel once a year; she, however, needs over a DECADE.  Which leads me to my next criticism.<br /><br />One would think that with eleven years of reclusive struggle, the final work would be hugely imaginative.  Incredibly, however, this book, written by an art history major, is all about art, art history, paintings, forgeries, and even concludes with a numbing thesis on the purpose of art itself.  The experience, quite frankly, is like watching her masturbate in public.<br /><br />As to the book itself: there is no plot.  I for one don't necessarily need a plot per se, but the book goes out of its way to shape itself as a plot-oriented novel, and then all the plot points and threads and character issues are left completely and totally unresolved.  Theo's crappy fiance, Pippa, Lucious Reeve, they all just STOP.  Since people keep comparing Tartt to Dickens--an astounding comparison given that Dickens was the closure master--I would liken the experience to reading Dickens' unfinished Edwin Drood.  He at least had a legitimate excuse for not finishing: he died.  Her characters, however, just STOP once the problem of the painting is resolved.  And this, finally, leads me to the biggest problem of the whole book:<br /><br />WHY DIDN'T THE KID JUST RETURN THE DAMN PAINTING?  The whole books hinges on his keeping the painting; once that plot point becomes impossible to fathom, the book begins to feel like a waste of time.  For no reason I could discern, Theo tortures himself with the prospect of being caught and labelled as an art thief, but at ANY TIME he could have returned the painting, anonymously, and yet he doesn't.  His decision not to strains all credulity; an amusement park of dinosaurs resurrected from the DNA of the blood contained in a petrified mosquito is more believable.  What's more, I just didn't care that he had the damn thing.  His ridiculous decision to risk his life to retrieve the thing also turns the novel into a preposterous and poorly written airport thriller without the thrills.  And once the painting takes center stage, the book, as others have pointed out, becomes plain boring.<br /><br />Much has been made of the author's detail in her prose.  And, indeed, the characters and details she creates do seem to be carved with tiny tools at a deeply minute and microscopic level.  However, detail aside, I was surprised at how little poetry the prose had.  It was workmanlike and the verbs were used correctly, but out of 800 pages, I can count on one hand the number of times I read something that resonated or sung.<br /><br />This is not the worst book ever written, obviously.  The portion of the novel which occurs in Las Vegas is hugely engaging.  Following Theo to the tract-home wasteland of his life with his horrible dad was enthralling and certainly kept me guessing.  However, even then that portion only reminded me of Russell Banks' Rule of The Bone, a far superior work of fiction about a teenage boy and his travails.<br /><br />I truly don't get the hype, and I think the hype is offensive to more talented writers whose biggest sin is producing multiple novels before three full Olympic games have come and gone.oint becomes impossible to fathom, the book begins to feel like a waste of time.

0987300911|5.0|First i started without this book, but later by using this book my score going more better in practice exam, My advice is you can use this book as strong guide to target your IELTS Band in short time.<br />For Non-English people whom having good level in English they can use the same with some addtional practice exams...<br />all the best for all
0316055433|3.0|This book was way to long for the story being told. Too much detail being put into unimportant aspects of the book, like the debauchery in Vegas. How could he stoop so low to tarnish all the goodness and grace his mother taught him? I just read &#34;The Shoemaker's Wife&#34;, it is an excellent book and thoroughly enjoyable. Do not think I will read Ms Tartt again.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Very good book. Researched and interesting pieces of our history that isn.t in other books. Totally enjoyed it. Loved the way it covered many subjects.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. I habe watched it more than 5 times since getting it and havd referred it to all.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Don't use it much as the Kindle cannot change the direction of the lense, which in of itself, makes this software highly unusable. Additionally, the Kindle has it's own camera setup, which those inadequate, does okay for spur of the moment shots. That is if you can turn the Kindle and hold it, and capture the subject, while trying to center the subject, without looking at the screen. Good luck with that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Because the Coldplay song 'Atlas' touched me, I got interested in reading the sample. I couldn't put the book down after that!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I really enjoyed this game till they updated yesterday! Now it's more complicated and certain areas, like the shop and your power up menus, are less detailed. They are now large and unrefined. I feel like an adult trying to use the fat crayons design for a two year old. Though, I find the underwater idea interesting, it is still unnecessary!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it is available on my Kindle....it's addicting and fun at the same time!!!  The graphics are fantastic.  Highly recommend this game!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is amazing. It still haunts me. I think the author took us into a life and a world we would never understand until now.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|This is one of the few games that I have actually finished.  It is fun and challenging, but not too difficult for casual play.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|Five stars but only for those who  enjoy videos of the Rolling Stones from the 1970's.  This includes live performances of  many of the Stones most memorable songs.  Lots of close views of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and others.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Morgenstern's ability to tell a story is quite unique.  Her ability to hold the reader at the edge of uncertainty is amazing.  I look forward to reading many more of her books.  Hopefully she will not make us wait too terribly long.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Our seventh graders are reading it in English for the Holocaust unit and our eighth graders in the original German (&#34;Die Bücherdiebin&#34;) and are excited about it.  Great story with a poignant ending.  Rilke Schule, Anchorage, AK
B0063IH60K|3.0|It plays ok for awhile and then it stops.  I have to delete it and download it again.  I've had to do this at least 5 times in the past month.
0345803485|1.0|This was one of the worst writings I have ever read! I am sorry to have wasted my $3 dollars and my valuable time to read this book (it was too bad I couldn't finish!). It's like a young horny teenager is describing her dreamy magical relationship with an imaginary character to her teenage friend! I am sorry the movie is coming out, more people will be exposed to a garbage story with absolutely no content at all. Don't read this book.
B009NX1YT6|2.0|Thank goodness I'm not a high school student.  I don't remember anything like this.  Maybe because I didn't live in Hollywood.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this for anyone over 30.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. Best album in a long time. I waited so long for this flawless album. Hopefully I don't have to two years for the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very fun and the iPhone has it so it is good that they put it on the kindle GET IT ITS VERY VERY FU N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the series.  I really enjoyed the fact that there was more to it than just sex in crazy ways and places.  There was some drama and mystery.  I really loved the fact that the books were bundled together.  That way I could just start the next one immediately.  Highly recommend the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the game you always go to for some fun!  Sometimes I think I'll go crazy trying to get past some levels, but always go back for more!  It's so fun and  addictive!!!
B007KYQIEQ|3.0|I feel the story line is great the movie is good. Meg Ryan as much as I love her in so many of her films somehow in this movie she didn't put her full potential. Hugh Jackman considering his role he played in the movie he did extremely well.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Unexpectedly really enjoyed this adventure / whodunit movie.  Perhaps had we had higher expectations my rating might have been lower.  But, not much if any.  Easy to see why this movie was listed in the Classics genre.  Steve Mcqueen's character was smooth and cool.  One could guess some of the plot as it developed, but not all of it.<br /><br />Good escape and entertaining.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I am not one for reading ahead but the book took way too long in grasping my attention.  Even with knowing what the secret was, there seemed to be more than just the husband who had a secret...everyone did-or does. A real look at general discontent with life and how we keep our own secrets.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use, does exactly what you want it to do (except I can't find out how to delete books from my Kindle library). This device is great on an Android and an iPad too!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|A very thoughtful rendition of his last months. It shows how dedicated he was to make a better America. You have to be in the mood for reflection. The sad part, so many great actors look so old, yet can still give a good performance.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is a great CD. It is very relaxing and entertaining to listen to. Lindsey is very talented. I recommend it.
0307001466|2.0|Ruth Krauss, I Can Fly (Golden Press, 1951)<br /><br />The printing of this we have is from 1992, from a series of re-releases commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Golden Books. They chose a bunch of the ones they consider classics to bring back out. What parameters they used other than age, I do not know. One of the things about the older Golden Books that attracts me these days is that, in general, the language in them would today be aimed at first readers rather than the pre-lit crowd; it's not as aggressively simplistic. Here's the exception to the rule; this could just as easily have been written in 2011 as 1951, for all the linguistic reaching it's asking your kid to do. I wasn't all that fond of it, though as usual with Golden the illustrations are homey and comforting. More importantly, though, Davey didn't want much to do with it after the first few pages and, as I have often said, these days he is the final arbiter where pre-lit is concerned at Goat Central; not sure how much play this one's going to get at book tome from here on out. **
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Least satisfying of the two White-House-Under-Seige movies that came out within weeks of each other. Even Jamie Foxx cannot save this one. A surprising amount of talking is involved, and our heroes spend a considerable portion of the film hiding atop an elevator, chatting, where they go unnoticed by bad guys who've apparently never seen Die Hard or a dozen other movies where the good guys use elevators and air shafts to creep around. It never really gets fun and the special effects are a little weak, not the sort of thing I expect from Roland Emmerich. The villains are right wing ex-soldiers, disillusioned Secret Service agents, and ambitious politicians, as opposed to \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\", where the villains are Korean terrorists, disillusioned Secret Service agents, and ambitious politicians. As usual, you can spot the chief villain of \\"White House Down\\" right out of the gate. I won't say who or how, but you can check off the usual boxes, including most innocuous and seemingly nicest person. If you are surprised by the revelation of this person as the villain at the end, I think you aren't watching enough movies. Avoid this and watch \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\", which at least has the good grace to earn it's R rating with non-stop action and a gritty, ruthless hero.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So far it is really leaving me wanting more, once you start reading it, you can't stop. Really recommend it
B000VZYPB4|4.0|You quickly learn to laugh out loud. The Characters are smart, but down to earth. You soon learn to love them all.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game ! It is so cool. you get to fight dragons and warlords and stuff and giant spiders
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Started playing this while on a family trip and couldn't stop. My family had to stage an intervention to get me out of a game induced coma.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books.  I think if Veronica Roth wasn't trying so hard to up J.K.Rowlings she would have done a better job.  It seemed like she took a sharp turn when it wasn't necessary just to \\"shake things up\\".  Shock value isn't always the best way to make waves!!
B008JFUS0U|5.0|Thor the Dark World was fun. Honestly, I don't expect deep themes and heavy drama from my Super-Hero movies so I'm rarely disappointed. As much as I loved Thor (the original) I love this one MUCH more. The characters have already been introduced to audiences, so in this round they undergo the development that was lacking in the first.<br /><br />Thor is no longer the bombastic, arrogant juvenile that he was in his first film. His first priority is to restore peace to the nine realms, as it should be. He's heir to the throne of Asgard, after all. But he's distracted by thoughts of Jane Foster, the woman he didn't get to see the last time he was on Earth. ;) He checks in on her by asking Heimdal (who can see almost everything in the nine realms) how she's doing.<br /><br />Loki is angry, lonely, sad, an explosive... and that's just while he's in prison. After the events of The Avengers, he's been locked up, isolated from the only person he loves: his mother, Frigga. In desperation, he even conjures an illusion of her simply to have someone to talk to. When Thor finally comes to him for help (another desperate act) all he can promise is his rage and desire for revenge as assurance that he won't betray Thor yet again.<br /><br />We don't get enough of Jane in Thor and The Dark World to see how much she might have grown over the past two-and-a-half years, but she's an honest person, intelligent, and strong-willed. I have no problem believing that Thor would fall for her. I was satisfied with the 'ship in this sequel, wishing for more, but knowing a PG-13 comic-based movie wouldn't be able to deliver. The second tag scene (yes, there are TWO, just like after The Avengers) sated my shipper's desires.<br /><br />I think the most delightful part of the film was Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. You'll have to see the film to understand.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a fun ride with real peril and several laughs. I can't wait to see it again... and again... then buy it on BluRay. =D
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is awesome because there are tanks and guns and more!!! I like this game because when I have nothing to do I play this game! I would rate this game 5 stars. I would like to thank Gameloft for making such an awesome game.I will tell about this game to my friends . I recommend this game because if a child is learning about war I recommend this game to play it.
147674355X|5.0|This book was really good. I really enjoy Colleen Hoover's books. Great buy and easy read. I read it in 1 day.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, mild challenges so I can relax and play.  Can also play it with the grandkids.  Don't like all the ways you could spend money though.
1476747016|4.0|I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley(dot)com.  I have read a lot of the Pusheen web comics and enjoyed them, so I was excited to give this book a read.  It is an okay book, that is more cutesy than funny.<br /><br />Pusheen reminds of Hello Kitty with a more typical cattitude.  This book is broken into different sections: an intro to Pusheen, what you need to know about cats, how to live, intro to Stormy (Pusheen's younger sibling), and A Year in the Life of Pusheen.<br /><br />This would make a cute little coffee table book...especially for someone who's a fan of the Pusheen blog/webcomic.<br /><br />There is not a ton of content here.  I got this for review and breezed through it in maybe 20 minutes.  Some of the cartoons will be funny to cat lovers.  Some of it is just kind of cutesy.<br /><br />An effort is made to stick with theme of each section of the book.  It was okay.  I appreciate that they tried to give this book a purpose and organization for the cartoons.  However, I think it would have been a better book if they would have just had the cartoons in there and not force them to a chapter theme.<br /><br />I really feel like this could have been a bit more clever and funny.  I have seen other Pusheen comics that really make me laugh and there wasn't a ton of those in this book.<br /><br />Overall this was a cute book but nothing fantastic.  It's one of those books you can lay on the coffee table and someone can pick it up and page through the whole things in 15 minutes and go \\"Oh, that was kind of cute\\" and then it will be forgotten.  I guess if you are a huge Pusheen fan or cat fan go to the bookstore and give it a look through.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|A lot of content is not supported on this technology<br />Hulu videos  and youtube videos are choppy. They run smooth on my laptop but it hangs up on the TV all the time.  Audio is fine but video sucks. Terrible to watch. So disappointed- what a waste of 35 bucks It's useless.
030758836X|1.0|Hated this book.  Didn't like or care about either character at the end.<br /><br />Also pg. 425, in the police interview she says she was in the \\"trunk\\" of the car and yet she knew that Desi stopped the car at Hannibal to throw her purse out.  How did she know that when she was tied up in the trunk?<br /><br />That and a lot more besides made me very mad I wasted time on this book.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|This movie was just awful.  If  you want to see how it should have been done, watch the original &#34;Die Hard&#34; again.  Channing Tatum is no Bruce Willis and the girl who plays his daughter I couldn't stand.  Spoiler - the scene at the end where she is out on the White House lawn with a flag waving off the bombers was laughable.  Don't pay to watch this movie.  Wait until you see if for free if you just have to see it.
1400067820|5.0|Better than Fooled By Randomness, this is a great way to look at the water hazards of your career steeplechase.
1594202273|5.0|A truly incredible piece of non-fiction.  Few non-fiction books that I have read have been able to so elegantly blend a detailed, unique, and interesting story with a broad and thorough understanding of the historical context leading up to and surrounding it.  This is not just a broad history of the command and control of nuclear weapons, nor is it just a story about &#34;the Damascus Accident&#34;, but rather it is a unique and perfect combination of the two.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and makes you use your head.  You basically draw a line to connect similarly colored dots, but you are not allowed to cross lines.  My 8-year-old blows me away at this game all the time.  I had played this game prior to purchasing it for the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it which s why I purchased it for myself.  It's definitely a puzzle game that makes you think spatially.  You should give it a try.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|I was disappointed that Season 3 is not with CC, because I am hearing impaired.  Otherwise I am comparing it to Downton Abbey and up against this is does not come close to be upper successful
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Great movie - great sequel to the original.  A good family movie that the grown-ups will enjoy as much as the kiddies, tweens, and teens.  Be advised; \\"Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang\\" is the same movie as \\"Nanny McPhee Returns.\\" There are only two that I know of.  I'm watching for the 3rd one!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it is awesome.I love how we can chat with people and meet new people<br /> The dragons are so cute and cuddle and I like to see all the dragons
B003G4W49C|3.0|I don't want to have to write 20 words when I thought I thought it was good and that is all I have to say
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|excellent film really held my attention. don't need any more words for description so this is absolutely ridiculous to require this many words
B0061S0A64|5.0|I love this game.  You have a series of &#34;Generators which produce either drum or synth sounds.  You then position nodes around your generators to create music.  Placement of your node determines whether it connects to a single, or multiple generators.  You can set note length (1/8, 1/4, 1/2 notes) as well as set overall song tempo.  You can choose the note waveform and add effects like Echo, Attack, Decay and Release.  The background of the &#34;playing field&#34; also acts as a keyboard to strum/tap on once you have your generators and nodes in place.<br /><br />This game is tons of fun and I would recommend it to everyone who loves playing around with music.<br /><br />I wonder what kinds of changes will come with a new release.  Sounds?  More note manipulation?  I can't wait.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|OHMYGAWD!  I couldn't tear myself away from watching all three seasons with CC (I am hearing impaired).  Hope the 4th season comes in soon with prime and is also in CC.  Thank You and Kudos to Amazon for this video selection.  Needless to say Fanfreakingtastic.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It starts out pretty easy, then gets very hard. I have been stuck for a week on the same level.  I am glad they impose a limit on how long I can play.  It is a good thing it's such a fun game!!!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Funny, heartwarming, and based on a true story.  I love movies like this because I learn a few new things about history while being entertained at the same time.  Phenomenal acting, an interesting plot, and a glimpse into the pre-WWII days make this a worthwhile investment of your time.  Enjoy!
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I was born into a solid Republican family the year FDR was elected.<br />Everyone was decent enough folks who all hated FDR.<br />As a kid I had a job setting pins in a bowling alley - my first paycheck<br />was $2.40 with a 24 cent deduction (a movie: 25c) I ask mom about<br />it - she said, &#34;thats the Roosevelt tax - you'll never see a dime of it!&#34;<br /><br />This book gave a clear picture of the ungodly decisions facing our<br />country - and president.  Yes, he was indecisive as hell; yes he toadied<br />to the southern racist Democrats;  yes he should have taken us to war<br /> in Eurpoe in '37…….<br /><br />This book also notes the far out mood of ISOLATION which was sweeping<br />the country because of the way WW1 was settled - without a surrender by Germany.<br />FDR's biggest  critic was the great American aviator hero, Charles Lindbergh.<br />Lindbergh was a womanizer who buddied around with Adolph Hitler.<br /><br />This  isolation mood swept the country and divided us.  And it was not along party lines.<br />It was a mix of both.  Wendel Willkie, the '40 GOP  nominee had been a lifelong<br />Democrat and progressive.  He ran as a Republican.
0312965788|5.0|If you love books about animals and the people who spend their life caring for them, then you'll love this book.  It's an enjoyable read!

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Loved every minute of this book.  Great experiments to prove to yourself that we really do create our own reality.
1476729085|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It is lighthearted, but insightful and may appeal especially to those, who like the British Tv series Doc Martin.
B004SRNH10|4.0|Good app.  Everyone needs this on their devices.  It works great.  I would recommend it for everyone.  Its free . Get it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|In true Down Abbey form, it follows history and tells a wonderful story of one family's trials and tribulations, including the lives of their extended family, their faithful servants. I have the 3rd season to watch, and I need to make time to do it. The acting and casting are superb. The house beautiful and richly furnished. All aspects are a win!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|a most engaging tale of time travel, sea faring, pirates, kidnappings, medical intrigue and enduring marital love.  excellent read from a beloved author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Very hard to put down. I read the entire series. The first book and last book are the best.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|Enjoyed better other Hemingway books. Too much dialogue and drunken garbage, plus, that Brett was a royal bitch, can't see what the fuss was about.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This is the latest in the Vorkosigan Saga.  It has humor, surprises, wonderful characters, an engaging story.  If you've read any of Ms. Bujold's other books, you won't be disappointed in this one!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love angry birds.  And I love it when there is no adds.  I wish they would put other angry birds on the special apps of the day.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was a nice escape. At times a little hard to follow, but that's me. Going to see the movie to compare and contrast.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Great Mule CD.  Definitely has some of the best and most exciting Warren Haynes studio guitar solos ever.  Captured and Bring on the Music are instant classics.  I am no audiophile, but the recording quality feels like it could be better.  I don't know how to explain it other than to compare it to something that I think sounds good like &#34;Hittin' the Note&#34;.  That seems so much cleaner.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have been having a lot of problems in the last few months with car chargers and my various mobile devices.  I have been using an ipod touch, a Galaxy Nexus, a Galaxy S4, and a Galaxy tab--along with a Galaxy S3 and an iphone at various times.  I was having a real problem getting devices to consistently charge in the car--especially the Android devices that I would use as a GPS.<br /><br />The charger would not charge or keep up with the battery usage.  I would plug my phone in at the beginning of my trip, and after a couple of hours using it as a GPS I would discover my phone battery went down drastically--as if it did not charge at all.<br /><br />I then proceeded to try various different car chargers I have used in the past, with mixed results.  One day it would work, another day it would fail.  I also bought a bunch of new branded ones that claim to output a total of 3 or 4A output, but in practice they would not charge when I plugged two devices in at the same time (Android phone and ipod touch).<br /><br />I was ready to give up, when I came across this Anker product.  Based on other user reviews, I thought I would give it one last try.  To my great relief, this one actually does charge my devices--as promised.  Thank you!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|This album is simply amazing!  I was never a big creed fan, so I never really took to Alter Bridge at first, but got into them when ABIII came out.  Of course, I loved it and quickly gave a listen to Blackbird and was amazed at the creative genius. This album really exceeds my expectations. I would expect Mark Tremonti and Myles Kennedy to continue to contribute wonderful guitar work and vocals on future albums as well.  I wonder if we will have to wait another three years for a new album?  If so, it's a long wait, but I am sure they will make it worth it.<br /><br />  There are no bad songs on this album.  Perhaps a couple are not quite as mind blowing as others, but I give this album a solid five star.  Even then, I consider it better than many of the other albums I would have rated five stars.  According to the ratings this album is getting, nearly everybody loves it.  If you are an Alter Bridge fan already, you definitely need to get this.  If you like heavy but moving rock, or even melodic metal, and, in general, have an appreciation for good no nonsense music, you need to get this album.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This was a rewarding movie with good acting, compelling characters both large and small, and excellent story-telling. It's a little gem.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love mahjong.  This came will entertain you for hours.  Great to keep the kids busy while you shop or on trips.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, it was my first experience with Eggers, and I would highly recommend. It's very easy to digest and understand, and never gets boring.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I've gotta say that Star Traders has been worth the $3 it cost, as the fifty or so hours that I've logged have been entirely fun. My only problem is that it should probably be put under the strategy category, rather than RPG.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This alarm clock is great. It wakes me up in the morning. I just don't like all the adds. I'll most Lilly update it soon.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Fab, of course, but why not include the songs 'A Picture of You' and 'Dream Baby' recorded for the BBC? I don't want to believe it's because they feature Pete instead of Ringo, but...... And I can't seem to find an explanation for those dagger footnote markers next to the titles of some songs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It holds your interest until you loose your life lines. I only wish I did not have to wait so long to regain my life back.
0307454568|1.0|Too many characters and too many subplots. Needed more focus on main characters rather than those in the shadows. Dissapointing end to a series I was prepared to love.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster was messy and frustrating but it sucked me in.  Abby and Travis's relationship was horribly unhealthy and nothing anyone should ever want for themselves in the real world.  If it was the real world, America would have  been begging Abby to break it off and get herself a restraining order and Shep would have been pushing Travis to find a girl who didn't torture him by constantly messing with his head.  But it wasn't the real world.  It was fiction and in fiction, the passion and drama of scary, messy and unhealthy isn't a recipe for disaster.  It's a recipe for true and undying love with a happy ending. This is why I found myself routing for them and enjoying their drama filled, rollercoaster of a romance.  And it is also why I have every intention of reading Walking Disaster as well.
B00G2SIW7M|2.0|I no longer have the visceral hatred of disco that I had in the 70's, but it is far from my favorite genre. Sadly, listening to the 7:32 title track of this album took me straight back to the days of Donna Summer and polyester leisure suits.<br /><br />None of the other tracks annoy me as much as the first, but they neither do they stand out.<br /><br />I love Arcade Fire's earlier albums, \\"Funeral\\" and \\"Neon Bible\\".  The songs on those albums are creative, catchy, and fresh.  Not so on this album.  For me, \\"Reflektor\\" is a huge let down.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Love this app! You can draw or do effects on your pictures which I love! Ignore the lower scores. And BUY THE APP ALREADY!!!!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Great book, story line developed well and kept me coming back to continue reading. This is the first book I've read cover to cover in well over a decade!<br /><br />Love the kindle format allowing me to constantly read on the go, however there were a few formatting problems with the book that showed up a lot in the internal emails, not sureif that's a kindle formatting thing or actual problem with the book typesetting<br /><br />Also noticed a couple of grammatical or proofing errors in the book, one in particular that stood out was about trending on twitter which repeated twice and was a bit confusing.<br /><br />Overall well written book that I highly recommend reading for anyone in an internal IT department.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|because the product did not help solve my problem with my kindle. My kindle was incapable of holding a charge; so the product was not what I needed to correct my kindle problem.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Great game.  Fun to play.  My only issue is that when I go to quit it does not close cleanly; it goes to a &quot;force close.&quot;  It would receive a 5 star rating from me if it weren't for that issue.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I played it on my friend's kindle. It is a pretty good game to pass the time. The graphics is clear. It is nice on the kindle fire hd or other android devices.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|First of all let me just state that I have always admired the character of Superman. Christopher Reeves brilliantly portrayed Superman. On a similar token Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are all accomplished actors and actresses in their own right, and they helped to breathe new life into the mythos of Superman. I honestly do not care what critics have written about this film. I believe Nolan did a great job showing the audience the humanity of Superman and why he would sacrifice anything to save earth, no matter how much pain it caused him. On another note I felt that the action in Man of Steel was absolutely intense. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will continue on to recommend it.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|Kevin Costner does a magnificent job portraying the infamous Wyatt Earp! This superb cast delivers a powerful and touching performance! A \\"must-see\\" for western lovers!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Full disclaimer: I have never read any of the Dredd comic books, so if you haven't either, this review might speak to you.<br /><br />The only good way for me to start explaining my like for this movie is to compare it to the first Dredd movie. And but the way, you can breathe easy because the older Dredd movie is in no way related to this one, except for the titular character. Out of the two, I like this movie much more because it seems to mix characters, action, and plot better than the old one. To me, the old Dredd movie seemed, as many adaptations do (see The Shinning), to be overly focused on the big name actors in the film rather than conveying the source to a new medium and new audience.<br /><br />The tone is perfect; it's unabashedly violent and dark, and I enjoyed every second of it. The look and feel fit the description of Mega City One that the movie is trying to sell. Tension can be built without being either too soft or overly dramatic.<br /><br />The plot is interesting enough to keep your attention but not convoluted. There is no obnoxious cliffhanger in a transparent bid for a sequel tie-in, but on the other hand, they could easily make another movie if they saw fit to do so.<br /><br />Dredd never takes his helmet off, and he feels an appropriate distance away from us for the character. He's too cold and by the book for you to get close to, but then again, Dredd very much feels like a character you're not supposed to be close to. He's an outsider, and his distance tells you that this exclusion is part of his sacrifice for putting duty before everything else in his life. At the same time, he also bends the rules just enough for you to have no doubts about his humanity. We're meant to feel some sympathy or empathy for him, even if we're not allowed to get too close, and the simple yet compelling performance of Karl Urban gives us that too. It's a Dredd 'sweet-spot' if you will.

B0040T7CFS|5.0|A very good collection for the price.  I have gone through about 50% of the discs so far and have found that the recording quality is generally clear and crisp.  I have certain preferences when it comes to the cantatas, passions, oratorios, and the Mass but to have everything in one collection is convenient beyond words.  Each disc comes out to be less than $1 per which is amazing.  I've spent upwards of $50 for the 2 Passions and the Mass by J.E. Gardner.  The DVD bonus discs of the passions and .PDFs of the complete works round out this superb collection.  Highly recommended.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Completely in love with this season so suspenseful! I can't wait for Sundays show what is the mayor going to do!? Is Carol coming back?
B0058YPL66|5.0|For me this series started off in a conventional way, and I didn't think I would like it, but I soon saw that it was very inventive it its reinvention of well known stories - constantly engaging for me.  Some fantastic performances, and I love the costumes.  Some repetitive story lines in the middle, but worth it in the end.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|When i listened to Born This Way the first time, I felt more amazed and floored with the few, fun songs after being disappointed with the first single. It was a very good album, but it also had some disposable fillers like Born This Way, Americano, You and I, Fashion of His Love, and The Queen. With ARTPOP, I was less impressed, honestly the only songs i really like are Mary Jane Holland....her best track that feels like a leftover from Born This Way, G.U.Y. which feels like LoveGame 2.0, Do you What You Want...a fine collaboration with R. Kelly, Artpop...perhaps a lost Missing Persons track, Venus...a David Bowie influenced track, and maybe Fashion!...a much improvised version of Fashion of His Love.  The rest just didn't slayed me like the songs on Born This Way and The Fame even though some songs did felt like a mixture of those albums.  I feel like the fillers on Born This Way even outshine the fillers on ARTPOP. Jewels N Drugs sounds like a weaker version of Starstruck and Paper Gangsta. It sounds overproduced and had too many things going on. Her vocals just didn't blend well with the beats. I was completely bored outta of my mind with Gypsy and Dope and their weak lyrics. They are nowhere near amazing as Brown Eyes. Swine just feels super duper generic with mindless EDM beats. No hook whatsoever.<br /><br />Some people had issues with her vocals sounding like she's straining and the weak lyrics in some songs, but my main problem with this album is the production. Many of the songs just didn't feel that catchy and mind-blowing like her previous albums. There are just no sparks, no hooks, nothing. It just feels there. I feel that after The Fame Monster, the quality in her music had declined with ARTPOP being her weakest album yet.  Spewing out more pop but less art. During the Fame era, I thought she was the coolest chic around. The Fame and The Fame Monster were definitely her BEST work by far! No pretentions, not too preachy, and overproduced. They were just simple albums that focused mainly on the music rather than her forced creativity. I don't think she will be able to top those albums. Those were her true gems, IMO. The production on those albums just felt more consistent that it doesn't make you want to skip that much. I've been listening to The Fame alot lately and it still sounds amazingly fresh and addicting just as it did 5 years ago. That era did felt somewhat special to me. Those synthesizer sounds.  Now, I'm not saying ARTPOP is a terrible album. Some songs are good, but I just wish there was more consistency in the production of the songs overall which I felt brings the album down. It doesn't matter to me whether she decides to evolve from or regress to The Fame, there has to be some cohesiveness and consistency involved.  Here is how I rank the songs.<br /><br />GOOD:<br /><br />Mary Jane Holland<br />Venus<br />Sexx Dreams<br />Do What You Want<br />Applause<br /><br />AVERAGE:<br />Artpop<br />G.U.Y<br />Fashion!<br />Manicure<br />Aura<br />Jewels 'n' Drugs<br /><br />BAD/WEAK:<br />Donnatella<br />Gypsy<br />Dope<br />Swinelbums that focused mainly on the music rather than her forced creativity.

B008J5G1GA|5.0|My first pair of Keen Newport sandals lasted 9 years!  I used them for kayaking, fly fishing, hiking, and everyday footwear in warm weather.  They finally got so worn on the soles that they needed to be replaced.  They are comfortable. versatile, and good looking.  They are not cheap, but in this case, you do get what you pay for.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Worked great for about a week then closes down seconds after opening updated and lost all my downloads it's a waste of time don't bother
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was a fun thriller and I had a hard time putting it down.  It was an easy read with some fun twists.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I Found the switching of voices between tris and Tobias confusing. Not happy with ending. First two books were much better.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is one of those rare novels that you can't describe-you just have to believe the reviews and dig in.  It is so heartwarming an poignant yet so poweful the way the author sets up the storyline that I couldn't put the book down.  You don't have to be an art lover to appreciate the story-you will love it nonetheless!  I haven't read a book like in a great while.  Donna Tartt really outdid herself with this one.  Do not miss it!
B001C1066E|5.0|Are you a Naruto fan, or do you just love frog coin purses?  Well either way this is one great little coin purse.  I bough this one for my wife, who just loves Naruto and also loves &#34;Gamachan&#34;, so I found this item here and bought it.  It is a pretty good likeness to the anime version.  &#34;Gamachan&#34; does a good job of holding quite a few coins in his stomach.  Make sure he's well fed with coins, and he will do a good job of keeping them safe and all in one place.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is  so awesome with the new updates its cool because you can go on servers and stuff like that and it just fun
B00E8B1358|1.0|The story, the action sequences, the acting were beyond horrible.  I'm ashamed to have wasted almost two hours of my life enduring Hasbro violating my childhood memories.
6305508550|4.0|Great movie that can be watched again and again. It was filmed in my hometown, so it brings back fond memories.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|First of all its free to download so that's a definite plus point. The graphics are good and it's easy to play. On the down side, there are way too much \\" in game purchasing\\". I don't bother with all that, if I'm out of energy then I don't play it. Simple. But I can see some people getting caught up with buying energy and tools ext. Other than that a good game.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I'm still reading it and re-reading some parts of it.  I really like the positive aspects and the &#34;easy to understand&#34;  experiments to create for myself.  I am a huge fan of the Abraham teachings and this follows along with it in many ways.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen.  The acting is superb, and the scenery is gorgeous.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Exciting movie! Great entertainment on our flight. Brad Pitt rarely disappoints in any of his films.<br />A bit more fast paced than Walking Dead.
030758836X|3.0|While Ms. Flynn is a very talented writer, I grew tired of this story.  There were no heroes, and I like heroes and a satisfying bad guy/girl gets caught/punished ending.  Yes, it was very creative... but ultimately dreary and kind  of depressing.  I was glad when it was over.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|I ordered these for my 4-year-old to help with fine motor skills.  Realistically, I think she still enjoys her duplos more, but I'm sure she will grow into these.  The container will be great for holding additional lego collections.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love to read Nicholas Sparks books.  This book, although I figured out what was going to happen before the end, was enjoyable.
0312427999|5.0|A page-turner.  Thoroughly researched.  Forty years of world history and economics explained in simple terms.  An excellent expose of the free market myths.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So nice to go directly to my e-mail. It is fast and accurate. Very relaxing to just go to when I want.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|Antivirus programs show this as intensive adware. The second you boot your tablet or phone this application powers up as well.
B003G4W49C|1.0|In a word, dull. The book drags on and on - lost interest not even half way through. Strange at best.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|it never opens just indicates that it has 'stopped' whatever that means don't bother with it just read in regular format
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great product. Works as described. Was very satisfied with the performance and quality of the product in whole. I recommend this product to buy
B00006RAKP|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she had been wanting this Elton John - Greatest Hits for a long time.  She thorouly loves and enjoys this cd set.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|I can honestly say ARTPOP is unlike anything I ever heard before. It pushes the envelope and it's somewhat strange but I like that. I was pleasantly surprised with \\"Do What You Want\\" and \\"Jewels N' Drugs\\" it's a cool urban twist in the album and GaGa shows she can hang with the thugs, lol. I also liked the fact that she let her guard down with \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Dope\\" showing vulnerability. All in all ARTPOP is a party album that gets you on your feet and makes you dance all by yourself.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Sure it skips through time a little bit and could afford to be another 100 pages richer. But I'm not complaining. Scalzi can write with flair, create moving characters with real feelings and set it all against the bizarre vastness of deep space.<br /><br />That is skill.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is challenging without being off-putting. I find it to be strangely addicting, but I do not like having to wait for new lives of being proportioned to buy one.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|I love the Lord of the Ring but the extended edition; was a little excesive. Yes; it improved somewhat the theatrical version; but make it too long to watch again; and the second time was really boring.<br />I saw The Hobbit Extended version (which is only a few minutes longer than the theatrical) and I can only say that if you expend money on the theatrical; avoid expending in this version.<br /><br />The beginning has been changed; adding a character (the Elf King) that will appear in the second part and explaining (very unclear ) about the end of relation between Elves and Dwarves.  Aside from that an trying to establish a relation with the Lord of the Rings (not contained in the book) it is basically the same movie. In fact it seems Jackson is try to do changes to the original script and is asking as to pay in order to avoid the surprise in the next.<br /><br />Do not be fooled. It is Ok; but far from necessary and it does not have the same effort of the other extended saga.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was playing a similar game that I found in the app store and loved it.  I guess a week or two ago I was going thru the app store again and low and behold candy crush was finally available!! I'm addicted , good thing is I had some practice from the other game lol! Thanks for making candy crush available!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a DIY fanatic and love doing crafts and cooking. There is alot of fun an silly things also. Love sharing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I wanted to be able to stream through Netflix and this does just that.  I have had a few instances where the device just was not synching with everything and it required unplugging the Chromecast from my TV and resetting my router.  When it is up and running, it is terrific.  I'd say I've had issues with seeing the Chromecast device on Netflix on my phone about 20% of its use.  Most of this was to watch the entire series of Breaking Bad.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have a range of interests, one of them is gaming and this mouse holds up very well.  Love the placement of the buttons, the quality of the material and the ability to change the mouse color.  Too bad you cant change the color of the wheel--but who am i kidding, fantastic mouse.  Take that Microsoft and Logitech.  Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit!<br /><br />:)<br />-MM
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|the game is fun, just the fact that there are a few glitches is the only reason I wont rate it for 5 stars.
B003T0G9Y4|5.0|All i can say these books get better and better and they are still<br />as funny as the first one i am sorry she hasnt written any more<br />would love to know what happens to luke and becky
B006LSZECO|3.0|After spending my time reading this book and loving it all the way through I was sooooo disappointed by the ending!!!!  Really????? the author couldn't come up with something better than that??  I was going to read another book by this author, but I don't think so now.  This is the first time I've ever reviewed a book.....that's how bad the ending was.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|New animated characters in the sequel are just meh, with a couple of exceptions. None of them make you laugh at their ingenuity.  Plot is predictable and fails to provide an emotional jolt like other Pixar movies. On balance, let your kids watch it, but skip it yourself. It's the worst Pixar movie so far.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.<br /> I love how there is no commercials and the quality is super, both my hubby and I enjoy it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|It is an amazing story that I love sharing with my granddaughter.  It has opened her 9 year old eyes to what someone will endure to get educated and how lucky she is to have it.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Eat, Pray, Read: The Signature of All Things is a zoetic novel with the salty taste of tomorrow morning.<br /><br />A fictitious tale set in Victorian times about a woman who entered the male-dominated scientific community via Botany. This moss-based novel, set in London, America, Tahiti and the Netherlands was a delight to read but I am wondering if Elizabeth Gilbert is COMMITTED to sequelizing this one as the climax ties up every loose end in the 512 pages.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|A truly, Unexpeceted Journey. I had been a fan of Lord of the Rings and could not wait to see Peter Jackson come back to middle earth, and this time its even better. First and foremost the theatrical edition is fine, great, but the extended edition is better simply put, there is more middle earth. And the more the better. Jackson is truly obsessed with something wonderful, he has dedicated his life to the work of Tolkein and it shows. I cannot wait for Smaug I look forward to each installment and its extended edition.
B00422LESO|4.0|It was entertaining and I enjoyed it. The writing was OK. It certainly didn't compare to actual 17th or 18th century English novels. I wish it would have ended in a more interteresting and less cheesy way.
0811876373|5.0|This is a Great book with alot of great ideas and photographs.  Although making the cake pops is harder than it looks!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|W  is for Wasted is another great book by Sue Grafton.  Her books hold my interest and I read them very quickly. I eager await her next book.
B00D0N5CSO|4.0|Characters well done, plotting skilled, and hard to put down.  The author has delivered, in this earlier tale, what made his style so addictive
B0061S073A|5.0|my 3 year old loves this and can navigate the apps on her own.<br />the kids place video player is also great to add nursery rhymes and educational videos.
B0063FGFK0|4.0|Affleck really shows the doubters he can not only act well but he can direct, really well. In my opinion this is Ben's comeback, The Town. And by saying that he really did have a hit and miss career until now (long as he is behind the camera). I highly recommend this film to anyone no matter if they are a fan of Affleck or not, or if they are a fan of Heist films or not, because this film is truly remarkable. A must watch!!!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Not bad; some good stuff here.  At times sounds cluttered; 8 songs too long.<br /><br />Aura:  :35 was a transition, determined to be fascinating and Middle Eastern, but it turned out to be the theme song to the circus, with a few notes changed.  Hard to take the song seriously after that.  It did try to be a political commentary, but someone either got scared or realized that the song wasn't really all that good.<br /><br />Venus:  I think this is probably the best song on the album.  The chorus is just wonderful; infectious and fun to sing.  I think if it were remixed to repeat more often, at the expense of some of the interplanetary exploration, it would be a #1.  The chorus harmonies required she push herself, and she rose to the occasion.  Not many people could sing the harmony.  The two voices she used for her \\"famous parts\\" was nicely done; neither, isolated, would get the point across.  However, it could never really play on radio, or in a movie, or on a soundtrack, or in a club.<br /><br />G.U.Y.:  I had more hopes for this; once I found out it stood for Girl Under You, I thought she might explore some really fun feminist concepts and turn them on their head.  But alas, she did not make the man the girl under her.  How cool would that have been!<br /><br />Sexxx Dreams:  Her voice vacillates between sex kitten Bardot and a strong Bette Davis Eyes.  Kinda tired and sleepy; sex but not sexy.<br /><br />MANiCURE:  Cute concept.  The tempo and the hooks are good stuff.  Beautiful showcase of her vocals.  However:  \\"Put your hands all over my body [parts]\\" will make some people unhappy.  At times I felt like singing \\"Oh Mickey, you're so fine...\\"<br /><br />Du What U Want:  Deliciously 80s.  I felt transported into the movie Mannequin; this would have been the perfect soundtrack for it.  Better without R Kelly; Christina nails it.<br /><br />Artpop:  Hard to believe this throw-away is the title track.<br /><br />Swine:  Is this really who I think it's about?<br /><br />Donatella:  The real-life Donatella stands for so much and represents even more.  What prime material, what a great opportunity for pop music and art to synthesize and to result in a really powerful (and maybe even empowering) statement.  It didn't.  And was vaguely insulting to The Community.<br /><br />Gypsy:  Edge of Glory and Born This Way, continued.  Her standard anthem.  Which will be fine when she becomes unsellable and has to release all the old songs over and over in themed collections, ie, GAGA BALLADS.<br /><br />Applause:  Too self-absorbed to be anything but a one hit wonder.<br /><br />Fashion!  Failure!<br /><br />Mary Jane Holland:  How edgy to sing about things that are becoming legal.  Should appeal to repressed teenagers.<br /><br />Dope:  I guess this is for people who needed to purge hazy memories of the 60s, or to be inspired by them.<br /><br />Jewels:  Wow, so much street cred./><br />Donatella:  The real-life Donatella stands for so much and represents even more.

B008OOYALE|4.0|I love the game but I hate that I couldn't take my game in progress, that I had spent a lot of time building up, from my Kindle Fire HD to my Kindle Fire HDX!! I had to start all over again as if I had never played the game!!! I am so disappointed about that!! It is the same with Farm Story and Pet Shop Story, all the games developed by the same company. :( People with iPhones have the same problem when changing devices.<br /><br /> It's nothing wrong with the Kindle Fire HDX. It's something the game developers have to change and should warn you about before you start playing the game and get hooked on it!!!<br /><br />You don't lose the games that can be connected to social media such as Facebook. They are saved.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|yes there is Kodachrome,  Hazy shade of winter, Mother and child, slip sliding away, and Bridge over troubled water but this album is by far his best work all on one CD. Cutting edge for the time. Little heard of outside of ubercool crowd of elitist music lovers. (I am wearing a black turtleneck dickie under a white V-neck sweater with gold chain on the outside as I write this).<br /><br />Woah Rocco, don't get all up in my grill, I wasn't making for of you or your yellow license plate.
0553582011|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a fine writer.  I had read the four previous books in this series and looked forward to the paper-back release of the fifth.  Even though the series may be classified as fantasy, Martin's character development is much more in-depth than that of most fantasies I've read.  And the story is a real page-turner.  The plot twists are believable, sometimes unexpected and always fascinating.  Anyone who loves medieval - period history will be hooked. I hope Martin finishes the sixth book soon because I never want to leave this world.

B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge of the Orgasm is a poetic masterpiece. I was not expecting these poems from the &#34;in your face&#34; bluntness of the title. Here i thought that I was going to be thrust into a testosterone fueled, egomaniacal rant that was mislabeled as a book of Poetry. I am not ashamed to admit i was wrong. Revenge of the Orgasm woos,seduces, satisfies, and cuddles with you afterwards. Wow!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A very fast paced game with plenty of bingo chances!! LOVE the ease of playing the different bingo games and collecting bingos!!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|It held my interest all the way. Almost as good as the original. I am not sure I care for all of the characters.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|This is an excellent album! I bought this as a follow-up to &#34;A Dramatic Turn of Events,&#34; my first Dream Theater exposure. As I said in the review of that album, I can't believe, being a progressive rock enthusiast, how I missed these guys for so many years. The talent and musicianship of this group is incredible! If I had bought both of these albums on cassette, they would be a tangled pile of tape by now. That's how much I have listened to both of them!!! I'm already chomping at the bit for their next release!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't play games that I have to use my money to buy extra &#34; iives&#34;  Anything electronic can be controlled, and it is funny that my goal is 40,000 and I put on , one time, 85,000 and still had to buy lives.  I know now, why Amazon wouldn't take your game and you had to go to King . com.
B009CVRQLY|2.0|There are a few good songs but for the most part too much experimenting with styles, her vocals, and so on.  She is trying too hard on songs to sound like something she's not and it doesn't work.  The single is \\"okay\\" but it's not going to be a massive hit.  I like Water and a Flame, Breakaway, At Seventeen, and Unfinished Songs.  Four songs, that's about it for me.  The rest of the songs she just tries too hard to be different or experiment with different sounds, affects, vocal style, or background vocals.  But the REAL reason I knew I didn't like this album two nights after I got it was because I went and listened to ALL of her other CDs.  In particular I'm talking about The Color Of My Love in 1993 through One Heart in 2003.  I once thought One Heart wasn't necessarily the best but listening to it in comparison with Love Me Back To Life it BLOWS it away!  There are a few weaker songs but overall the greatness is still there on her last bigger selling album. But the other studio albums in that time range are all spectacular.  I played them all in one sitting.  It's hard to understand how an artist can come up with such great music for a long streak like that, than hit a slump and cannot do it any longer.  I believe her voice is still good enough.  She is just lacking the songs, songwriters, or producers to make another great studio album.  Here's hoping for a better comeback in the future!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is getting closer to getting to Virginia but is diverted when he hitches a ride. It's hard to tell the good guys, bad guys and the innocent apart. That's what makes the book so intriguing. Another Jack Reacher hit!

B003XYERRM|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman's painstaking research is only outdone by her storytelling.  This book will make you rethink the story of Richard III as the &#34;wicked uncle&#34; of history.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Beautifully written. I couldn't put the book down. A love story everyone must read in their lifetime. Love this author's books!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Spectacular film following the best tradition of the series Star Trek. JJ Abrams manages to breathe new life into the characters so beloved by fans.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|It was nice to go back.....to the end of Reacher's army career and his see how he left the army. A mass murderer is around a special ops base. Reacher is sent to represent a clandestine army presence. As usual, there are suspects that result in a surprise ending. It was fun to read.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent The best of the best, this is the best show in TV ever is the equivalent of watching a movie on every episode
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|At first I thought it was cheeky having just different version of the same  song but it grows on you.
B00BOTCKCW|3.0|Rather slow moving and definitely lacks the excitement and sparkle of Downtown Abbey to which it has been compared. However if you are a fan of British family traditions and customs ( of which I am one ) then this would be another cup of tea for you!!!

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Incredible idea! Understandable enough for a teen reader, but complex & interesting enough for adults of all ages! I've already recommended it to 3 other people!
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE WITH A LOT OF ACTION GREAT QUALITY I WISH I DID NOT HAVE TO PUT SO MUCH INFORMATION FOR A MOVIE I LIKED.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|It's a shame I can'g give the book another half star - it's worth it.  But I never give books five stars.  Delightfully funny, and can be read in one gulp as a guilty pleasure on a Saturday afternoon.  And interesting that the author of what is essentially a light romance is a man.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was my second viewing of Downton which I shared with an Air BnB guest who was here for the month.  She is German and had not seen the series.  We watched the whole thing, an episode or two per day and we both loved it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Late to the party on this series but now I am completely hooked.  I think the next couple seasons will only get better.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|It's a cool game I'm Prolly the most  critical of all  course when it comes to thor &quot; wolverine or punisher I better be dam good .&quot;or its just a n insult!&quot;
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Actually its between OK, and I didn't like it kind of movie.  Expected better, but this version just didn't cut it for me, and I'm a pretty good fan of Superman movies. The Director, and Writer of this version really messed it up with this mindless violence/destruction that centered mostly on one city that made this movie not very enjoyable.  It was way too much destruction that took up much of the movie.  Also the break up of the scenes starting with the man of steel as an adult than to childhood, and than back again, almost caused me to just turn it off.  So, so at best, and I'm being generous.  See it for yourself, but if you are smart, don't waste the money until its really cheap, or your date turned you down on a Friday night, and wanted something to make matters worse.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I just finished this excellent book.  It is a masterpiece.  That being said, it is NOT for the lazy reader....used to a Grisham or Burke novel(both of whom I love btw) I read 3-4 hours a day, and have a Literature degree....and sometimes I grew a bit frustrated by the lengthy descriptions and characters.  BUT this is a tiny price to pay for the powerful  questions raised and pondered over here.  I would advise people to read it all the way to the end.  That is where the magic all comes together.  Very few books reach this level of intensity.  It is a somewhat grueling read, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy.....but this book is on that very high level of writing.<br />  The negative criticisms I've read here on Amazon are unfounded, although I understand people's frustration in reading this book. Frustrating perhaps because it is so deep and demands a lot from the reader.  But \\"The GoldFinch\\" is well-worth your time and effort!  It is not a \\"beach book\\" like most best-sellers.....but perfect for these long nights of Winter.  Like the classics of old, this book requires an open and sharp mind to appreciate.  I cannot recall reading a novel this good.....for it transcends our black and white---red and blue---good and bad mentality that has poisoned our minds in this age of the net.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Great game but still having issues connecting to Facebook to get more neighbors. Highly addictive with many challenges. I like the fact that you can help your friends with almost anything.  Try it out.<br /><br />Please be my neighbor and like my farm.  ID - FATSAUN
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Please note: *Spoilers* are needed to accurately review this movie. The biggest issue with this movie is that, at heart, it is not a Superman movie. It's a passable action film, though bloated in length (Mr. Snyder badly needs a film editor) and rife with plot holes. The solution to every problem is punch stuff, punch bigger stuff, punch the biggest stuff and then if there are any survivors left drop a building on them.    This doesn't make it a bad -action- film. It does however make it a bad SUPERMAN film. Superman is larger then any actor or portrayal of him. He is an ideal. A hero rivaled perhaps only by Captain America in his view of good and evil and part of this is that the good guy must NEVER sink to the level of the bad. Superman is not grey. Batman has grey areas. Wolverine has grey. Superman does not. He does not allow others to come to death because of his inaction no matter the consequences to himself because that is what a -true- hero does. He does not take life because that is the action of a villain. Even Batman wasn't compelled to take the Joker's life in the greatest superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight) but here in the first film in which Zack Snyder helms the greatest superhero our culture has produced Superman snaps a neck, takes the villain's life and also invalidates this completely as a Superman movie. This is not Superman. This movie is 'Alien Punch-Man undergoes pathos and wrecks s***.'    The best Superman movie made this year? It's called Thor 2, and is a much better watch.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Well this may be one of the few reviews you will read from a man concerning this video.  I grew up in a household full of girls and I was the only boy.  Needless to say, I never got to watch anything close to resembling a football game until I left the house.  One of the favorites of my sisters was this movie 'The Sound of Music'.  Every song, every phrase... memorized.  Not by choice, but through the repetition of my sisters constant viewing.<br /><br />I swore I would never watch this movie again once I was out of my parents house.  BUT, guess what.  I find myself a father and living in a household full of girls.  And of course every dad wants their little kids to be happy.  I remembered how much my little sisters loved and lived this movie when we were little.  So I decided to get this movie (I know I know I cannot believe it either) and of course my kids loved it.  The run around and sing the songs.<br /><br />Long story short:  This movie is a timeless classic.  Kids love the singing and the story line.  It really does look nice in Blu-ray as well.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Three clusters of characters whose lives are deftly woven together through a series of events that makes their lives  eventually intersect within a short period of time. Author's writing keeps you interested and the ending is unexpected. Nice, easy read for a long weekend or over the course of a week.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|Lots of goofy stuff, but entertaining never the less.  If you like action, this is it.  If you like technology this is it as well.  If you like love scenes, than NOPE.  Like Sex, Nope as well.  Want a great plot.  Won't find it here, but its still watchable in my book.  Good guys against bad guys from Outer Space.  Wait a bit for the price to come down if not in a hurry.
B00E5N8DGG|1.0|I don't know what the rest of these 5 star reviews are listening to and watching. But my Blu-Ray BLOWS in most every respect. These guys look old and tired. The playing is off key, sloppy and just lacks any kind of enthusiasm. Elliot's voice is gone. And seriously. You're in you 60's now. Leave your shirts on. But what absolutely ruined this thing to no end is the audio quality. Absolutely over blown to the nth degree low end thump. Really. Could NOT tone down the low end on my system enough to make it even remotely bearable. If you have a good system and are expecting decent sound you won't find it here. This has to be amongst the worst audio production that I have heard in fairly large and growing concert Blu Ray collection. Didn't even make it through one listen. It's just not worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging. I loved all the colors and as the levels increase it continues to get more and more tough to beat.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was very upfront with the type of story it was, but with plenty to twists and turns to keep you turning the page.  There was enough mystery through out the story so you didn't get too lost in the war strategies.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Great album!  As simple as that, if you like Arcade Fire, you will LOVE this album.  It is a different style than their other music (it's more dance-y), but it is great to hear a different side of their talent,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was riveting from the first page.  The horrors of war were shouting out at the reader. The characters were painfully real. I couldn't put it down!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Subway surfers is nice but has grows.When I play it crashes so I can't move witch I.Lose to the game .They do this because they don't want you to win
B00DY76Z32|4.0|Critics and I often disagree on the relative merit of films, and I think it may be because they watch to see what's wrong while I watch to enjoy.  I don't have a discerning eye, so I can't disagree with most of the critics' complaints about acting and scripting, but I thoroughly enjoyed R.I.P.D.  I liked Ryan Reynolds as straight man to Jeff Bridges, and Mary-Louise Parker was, as usual, absolutely perfect.  But Bridges was the center of the film, and he was great.  This only adds to his long string of sterling performances since his depiction of The Dude, and I can't wait for his next one.
B005PK56TA|1.0|The whole show seemed to be about sex.  It didn't really have anything to do with horror...I can't see watching any other shows in this series. I mean how is she pregnant again that fast, and is it her husband, or the freak in the plastic outfit that she obviously wasn't/didn't enjoy...it was all to dumb for me
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie is cheesy but I love it.  It's campy adventure/science fiction and the guys are cute.  What more do you need?
B00008OE4W|5.0|The movie was wonderful.  A great blend of action, suspense, and comedy.  The cast is very diverse and each one works well together.  There were some very funny moments and what a great surprise it was to see James Earl Jones show up at the end.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. Enough of a challenge to keep you playing,yet easy enough that you can figure out the puzzles. This is a fun game.
B008W31IFS|4.0|I got this book from hr library and am in the middle. I have a question for anyone who has read it. The jury is not supposed to know there was a previous trial. Bosch reads Kloster's testimony into the record but ther is a statement, presumably from the first trial to the effect, &#34;tell the jury.&#34; did the author make a mistake? Shouldn't he have redacted &#34;the jury&#34;
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This was not a bad game....but in retrospect it really did not hold my attention long. I had fun with it for maybe a week, and then I found that I moved along to other games. I would recommend it to anyone with some time to kill at airports.
B00CQ5R18G|5.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns of this great read from Patricia Cornwell. She almost always manages to engage me completely to the point that I'm still reading in the wee, small hours of the morning. the convoluted plot, familiar characters with all their flaws and creepily evil anti heroes just keep me coming back for more!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is such an upbeat and fun movie and the soundtrack carries that feeling too.  Sing along temptation is just too much and you've really gotta belt it out.  This makes me smile every time I hear it.  If you liked the movie you'll love the soundtrack!
B0000669JL|5.0|I am a fan of Reggae musice and Bob Marley. I can listen to this CD over and over and over again.
1609611543|3.0|It's OK... don't order this book and the cookbook too, unless you really want to get into this subject. After reading, I confess I am skeptical of the information given. I'm 72 and not that unhealthy and I love bread, especially the crusty chewy stuff. The jury is still out in my mind...
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I am really late to this show but after seeing it on USA, I love it!  Every show is absolutely hilarious.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Can play on computer or kindle. If I get stuck on kindle I go to the computer. It is a lot slower on the computer but, sometimes, it is easier to beat certain levels.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game is addictive,  and haven 't put it down yet. awesome!<br />I love the cool graphics and items we have to find that makes it really challenging.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|its a good game but there's a update and incantation seem to get it yet mabye I have to wait but still good game.
B000URWYTS|5.0|An experience and adventure. This is book that transcends time and space. One is suddenly there, loving this wonderful woman , and the man she loved, and became one with. Fame of them we can read, but the ecstasy and agony was theirs. And can not be truly comprehended.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This book kept my attention. A great collection of short stories woven together by Bryson in an appealing, humorous way. Very entertaining.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|I found this box set at Big Lots for about $5. It is a really nice set.  It has introduced me to Ultimate Edition sets and gotten me to read the series of books. I look forward to collecting the years.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This wonderful book will open your mind and your heart to other possibilities!  It is a very worthwhile read.  I loved it.
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|This game is hard for me to understand DO not used stand this game I guess I will have a child show me how to it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Besides THE SANTA CLAUS, this is the best Christmas movie of all time - for people of ALL ages. This could make the Grinch love Christmas!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun, fun,  fun!  I played my grandson's phone with this game...had to have it on my Kindle!  I am glad he showed me how to play!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I love the story of the young boy at the age of trying to figure out what love is.  He is sensitive and caring and also adventurous. I like the freedom he and his friend have to explore & express themselves. I love the expansive feeling of the river scenes.  Matthew McConaughey did a good job of playing what seems at first to be a shady character and then you find out that he was just a victim of loving the wrong person - but what model did he ever have? No parents... etc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I originally read this when it was first published.  That being said, this books has caused great division: Either you love it or hate it.  I happen to be the former.  Great writing and extremely engaging.  This book sets the bar for consuming storytelling.
1781162646|5.0|I really love pulp type books and this was great. Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. This story is so good and the quips about modern society so pointed.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I am still learning that game.it hard for me to get this but I keep on playing playing it must be because of my age 64'
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I go on this app and try to watch a video it says youtube has stopped please fix the app that will make my day
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Saw this at the movie theater and wanted our own copy & one for our grandchildren.  It is a historical, true story of a winning horse, his personality and his owner's dedication.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game i feel as if this is an mind and brain teaser. Its a fun and entertaining game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive. It would be better if it wasn't constantly trying to either get me to pay for new lives or advertise to my friends on Facebook. Other than that this is a good game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come to the kindle since it came out. I an so gals it is finally here! I play it all the time now. Be careful it is addicting! I can't put it down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it I can not get enough of this It was hard at first, but once I got it  I got it
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|We all loved Monsters, Inc. Monsters University has proven to be a winner as well. Myself, along with my Grandson LOVE the movie. Great Family entertainment.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I really liked Born This Way, Fame, and the Fame Monster (which was almost perfect by pop standards), but this CD sounds more like a B-sides collection than a new Lady Gaga CD...I was worried after I heard the first single, Applause, and rightly so.  Most of the songs lack even a basic melodic hook or good lyrics. If you are thinking about getting this CD think twice...perhaps stream it before you buy...I have loved 99% of what she has released in the past but 8 of the 15 tracks on this CD are garbage.
B00E9A656K|4.0|this game is awesome. the 2 problems I have is that you have to wait for gas. and you have to wait for the upgrades to get installed. otherwise its a great game and you should dealt buy it.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Excellent front to back!  Pearl Jam nailed it as usual!  The only complaints I have is that Sleeping By Myself is a repeated track from both Eddie Vedders Ukulele Songs and the soundtrack to the Descendants and the album is short like Backspacer was.  Otherwise it is a must buy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to have Candy Crush on my Kindle:) I have been waiting for this!!!! Way to go Kindle, keep the customers happy:)
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have always loved Emmylou Harris and this collection of her music is as wonderful as every one that preceeded it!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Feels like there could of been more behind it. Maybe a better explanation to it than what was told. Slow to the point.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good movie very entertaining.  Will watch it again. Denzel does agood job. The stream was very good quality and I had no problems at all.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Best TD game out there soooo worth it!! I would recommend it to anyone looking to have fun and just pass time this gAme is my escape from the world:)
B00B7FXYJG|1.0|The review title should be a hint<br /><br />Seriously - anyone who is an adult would barf at seeing animation - hell, I don't keep up with the tinseltown crap and I thought I'd missed one.<br /><br />Nope, they got one over on me....I don't mind them exploiting the franchise, but can I get my four bucks back?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A wonderful weaving of intertwined stories reflecting love, loss, sacrifice, life's expectations vs. realities, brave souls who fought against evil and suffocating boundaries contrasted with those who walked paths of expectation silently. The rise and fall of these character's encounters and the reflections of how their perspectives were shaped through the lens of circumstances was emotionally moving.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so incredibly addictive. It's fun but can be hard too when you keep crashing! Once you've tried it you can't stop
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great for quickly checking the radar and forecast. I use it every morning and evening. It is really easy to use.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Another great book discovered by virtue of Geeks Guide to the Galaxy. Plenty of action, irreverent humor, and twisty schemes. So much fun I bought the next one.
B004478AS4|3.0|An interesting story that shows how changes in politics can destroy old revered customs and destroy a culture, leaving a man to live in despair.
B003CH9PTU|3.0|Started the series from the beginning on the recommendation of my daughter. At first it was intriguing. Now, in the fifth season, we just want to get it over with. We don't find we actually like any of the characters. The sleazy lawyer seems to be the nicest guy in the lot. The plot seems always to be what terrible thing will happen next.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Love the game.  As said in other reviews the controls could be a little more intuitive, but nothing at fault in graphics or story (it is Final Fantasy, after all).
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a great game u can upgrade your vehicle and get brand new vehicles.its awesome!!!!!!!!!! get the game now its free
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|fun and addicting but had a few problems like I said. It was really fun for the first week or so but it had some problems on the kindle. It wouldn't let get back on it and was causing some problems for my kindle. I uninstalled it I woundnt recomend this app.
B001NLKZUA|2.0|I decided to give the second book a chance after a so-so feeling when I finished the first.  This one left me even more disappointed.  The storyline was not believe able.  Circumstances seemed to magically fall into place so the characters could progress in the plot line.  There are far better YA fantasy novel out there for kids to read.
B00DTMCSO2|2.0|This game is really cool and well,graphics. The first plane you get hardly moves in the air although it's still fun. The only way to go fast is to tilt down. It is very easy to control and sometimes will land well. I and if you have a kindle it sucks because in a corner there is a naked lady :( :( :( :( :(  I wish they would take that out!!!!!!!!! It's good for little children to fly though.<br /><br />  GOOD MORNING!!!!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is a good game.  Well thought out, and I can let the kids play it too.  No half clothed people trying to sell you on cars you already like.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game on my Kindle Fire.  It is fun and very addictive. I look forward to playing each day! Just wish I could play it longer. I use the daily rewards but wish we could get more without having to buy as I am not interested in spending $ on any.  Love the option of playing slots or bingo..Never boring!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this book!!  I went back and re-read The Shining prior to reading the new book, and I think that was helpful because then everything that had happened to Jack as a boy was fresh in my head.  Stephen King definitely did NOT disappoint in this sequel!
0316322407|4.0|loved it she is a great writer and author she makes you feel as tho you are right there with all the feelings and anger and fear she suffered
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I Love this game! Great on my Kindle Fire HD! Need friends tho so add me if you wish to.
B005ES131S|5.0|They are so comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities. I'm going to Costa Rica soon and hopefully these shoes are gonna give me a great time there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Re-reading before the movie comes out....just know everything gets turnt up to 11. Love this damn series ! ! !
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This book was very helpful in breaking through my blocks. The author has a unique take on resistance and our self sabotaging tendencies. I recommend reading this book to anyone who is struggling with their creativity and moving forward with their life dreams.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  i liked the other two but somehow stayed a little on the fence when it came to declaring any sort of fandom.  but this final volume sold me.  my only issue is the sudden change to a two-character perspective.  it took me a while to get into reading the Tobias chapters as Tobias but it ends up working, mostly.  over all, I think this is more interesting series than most of its caliber.
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|I'm writing again to revise my review. As advised, I continued reading in this book and finally came to some recipes, a couple of which might be useful.  But I think that while a lot of what he says is very good, some of it goes overboard.  I will definitely make some changes in my diet, but will not try to follow it 100%.  Sorry I jumped the gun in my first review.<br /><br />I watched a video about this book, Grain Brain, then purchased the book from Amazon, thinking it would give specific details about how to eat to eliminate all the terrible foods in our diets today and how to eat to add the right foods.  I found it to be just a bunch of history and statistics about how we got in the condition we are in that leads to Alzheimer's and diabetes.  But nothing about an alternative to what we've become accustomed to eating.<br /><br />To say I was disappointed was putting it mildly.  Why couldn't Author Permutter have given us a list of should eat and shouldn't eat items?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is fun and highly addictive! Once you start playing.you don't want to quit. Super fun game! It is a worth while download.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|LOVED IT!  A fantastic read for anyone at least remotely interested in a possible evolution into virtual reality.  I could not put the book down.  I really hope this awesome new author at least has an interest in creating a few more books into this universe.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Like the game but as you go through the levels they obviously get harder. The only problem is they are impossible to complete unless you are willing to buy extra lives.
B000069KGM|5.0|Nice to be the 200th reviewer of this double album. I am now getting into Chicago with a vengence. So far I have the first two (double albums), Chicago 8 and Chicago 18 in addition to two compilations. In my opinion this is one of the all time great debuts of time. Perfect music, sort of like hearing Santana for the first time. This is a classic!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Since I ordered this app I have not had any problems with it. . . Have had pop ups come up but I exit out of them without clicking onto them for more info and go to my home page then click back onto my Solitaire app to play. . . Easy as that! I love playing solitaire and I am not afraid to say that! (Although my 12 year old thinks I am a dork for liking it so much! Lol!)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was incredible. The range of emotions it brings. It really makes you think. I can only hope they make a movie of it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Was doing fine with the first version then was prompted to update so I did. Now Facebook won't even open. Keeps taking me back to the Kindle store. Please fix!
B00CJGP116|5.0|VIVIR MI VIDA!!!  the anthem to my every day!  I expected a few more songs on the album...maybe because I never want it to end...but each song is great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! Even the bad grammar!! Worth reading, especially the last few chapters. Highly recommend this to all romantics! !
B00023BLXK|5.0|This movie is about trust, regrets or lack there of, learning about other cultures, and the Cuban revolution. Plus also Javier is a studly Cuban man.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love candy crush have hard time putting it down ifriends .td me about it but it took me a long time to get it on my new phone now glad I did
B00G32OER4|5.0|Very scary and creepy without being bloody!  Very well acted and believable!  The way a good classic horror story should be!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is very well written and acted. I love the way the characters are so well developed. I can't seem to get enough of it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really loved how all the different storylines came together at the end.  Our book club read it and it made for very thought provoking discussion.... &#34;What would you do with the letter and would you tell anyone?&#34;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So I bought this book for my son to read for his English class. The book was long and so to motivate him, I told him I would read it with him. I wasn't too excited about it, but I wanted to help him. Well, I'm an old foggie, but I was pleasantly surprised with the book. The book was intriguing, sad, funny - it had a way of paining the scenery and the events in such a way that I could imagine them in my head. I definitely recommend the book - old or young.
B00DCX08MW|3.0|I love this game and its very fun and realistic. However, their is more historical missions and air planes that can be included. I would also like more available aircraft in the free version; compared to some of you're other games, this is very limited which surprises me. But overall I give this 3 stars for the realistic scenery, aircraft and missions and hope for more improvements!
B008XK69S6|5.0|I have tried them all and n7 beats them all hands down. What you get for free in n7 you have to pay for over and over again in many other applications. The sounds are fantastic and easily adjusted with a superbly responsive equalizer. I recommend this to anyone that truly enjoys clean notes and crisp sound. Throw everything else away, because it's only taking up space.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is completely addicting!  I play and compete with my friends to try and beat them to the next level!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Good way to spend time with friends on break time or lunch if you have no place to go and some time to kill.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|If you love the Little Mermaid this is a good addition to your disney movies especially to see them in High quality.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Although this is a work of fiction it reads like fact.  I had a hard time putting this book down and read it in a day.  It questions if the right to love and receiving love supersedes marriage vows to gain happiness.  To follow the lives of Wright and Mamah is absolutely fascinating, but again, it is difficult to believe this is a work of fiction.  Horan captures what we hear about Frank Lloyd Wright as a person and a great architect and portrays Mamah as the kind of woman of strength she would have had to have to survive an affair with a strong genius like Wright during the turn of the 20th century.  She also managed to be a woman in her own right.
B009C7JS14|3.0|So far I haven't been able to get a map of the radar..  I see this as a big part of the weather picture.  Perhaps its tere and I haven't found it.  If I am able to get that its great otherwise its mediocre.RH
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Freaking Love this album! It is terribly catchy from start to end. None of the other songs are better than &#34;Ms. Jackson&#34; but they are all still very good. I bought this whole album half expecting to be a little disappointed (&#34;Ms. Jackson&#34; was so good though I figured Panic had earned my purchase). I am so not disappointed and, am so glad I went for the full release.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Interactive and very well done love graphics and story line . Especially love that I can involve my Facebook friends as well!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Comes in plastic wrap and is exactly what i ordered for much cheaper than most stores!  Cant wait to give this as a gift.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It is an amazing book! I cant put it down. I will recommend it to other people! I love it!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use the fire out of it.  If I had more smarts (computer literate)it would really be wonderful.  It is always right there available and easy to use for me.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|This album is addictive. I've been a fan since &#34;Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not&#34;, and I've purchased all their albums from then to now. Can't say I loved &#34;Suck it and See&#34; but &#34;Humbug&#34; and &#34;Favourite Worst Nightmare&#34; were almost as great as &#34;Whatever People Say ...&#34;.<br />This album has me reeling! I can not stop listening to it, and I bought it during it's release week. If you have enjoyed any past Arctic Monkeys I am convinced you will enjoy this album. It has exceeded my expectations.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|By the end I really enjoyed this book. It lost direction at times, so I can't say it's perfect, but Green 's books are more about his characters than anything else, anyway, so I can forgive him for occasionally losing direction.
B003B02O0A|2.0|His first novel, which became popular after he did years later (and was a decent movie), but poorly written and construted - a novice effort. I read it recently prior to seeing the Broadway play based on it - the play included aspects not in book or movie - with Grisham's consent - but was inferior stage work.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If you like Team Fortress, then get this game. It's basically just like that, but for mobile. I recommend it, and the best part is that it is free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO PUT THIS GAME DOWN &amp; I SPENT HOURS ON IT. I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING THIS ON MY DOWN TIME AT HOME!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have never experienced anything like this.  I cannot put it down.  Engaging. Challenging and fun. Don't let it get to you. There is a victory. I'm st level 26 after 5 days
