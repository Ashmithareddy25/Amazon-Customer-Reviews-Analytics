0061245097|1.0|I got this book from my sister. I didn't know it was a follow-up so I am reviewing it based on this alone. The main character, Cat, is a bitch. I don't like her and therefore, don't really care what happens to her. She just treats people like s***. Besides her character. The plot itself is fast and hard to follow. I'd like to see more description; I find myself reading the same page over and over just to \\"get it\\". I haven't decided whether I am going to finish it or give it back to my sister. I'm glad I didn't spend money on this disappointing read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Even after plenty of miles on him.... and a lot less hair, Bruce Willis keeps his comedy going.  Watched this a bunch of times and still like it.  Highly recommended.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I love reading these books. The world created is wonderful and and the characters so real, that you really care about them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game my little sister plays it even my mom and grandma play its a must have game
B00124PXW8|5.0|Great acting. Great story. Great suspense. Minimal gore. Intense scenes. Great characterizations. Haunting music. Beautiful cinematography. Glimpse back at the 70's. Great movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Loved playing this game until the latest &quot;upgrade&quot;.  Now the pieces are slow to react and gets frustrating to play and the finished puzzle no longer fits the screen. Sometimes it's best to leave a good thing alone.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|i love this movie! so classy and sweet. plus keanu and sandra are so good together! its a good slow one! if you want a faster one, watch speed. ;)
B008CP6RWU|5.0|If you have not played at least two of this, it's more than worth the money, great indie games, and good extras.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great for passing time with my son. Great for traveling to keep him occupied in the back seat and taught him a little about suspension and traction.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's entertaining for the entire family to watch or even as a date movie. It's just the typical superhero mash up save the day movie. Pretty good, I would watch it again.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I used to play this game all the time on coolmath.com when I finished my school work so when I saw this app I just had to get it!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Found the movie fun and entertaining.  Had great action and some funny moments as well.  Would recommend.  Always like Iron man.
B000ANVPPQ|3.0|While a few westerns don't have enough comic relief, this one has too much.  I suppose audiences were easier to please in 1963.  But I found little struggle of evil/good, cowardice/bravery, deception/honesty, brutality/mercy that I was so hoping for.  John Wayne did what he could and the women are all extremely cute, but the movie as a whole seems hokey, cheesy, and dated.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I registered an account with this app, but it won't verify so I can't use it to get more bible translations
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I enjoyed it, great cinematics, plot was interesting.... Amazon wants more info than that so I'm typing this to fill in the word requirement
B00CCEHR80|4.0|Four stars only because IT Is not as big as volume One was.<br />But when you like JG as I do, you can't rate less than xxxx
1401937268|5.0|I like that you can use deck as two separate decks or as a single deck. great for advanced oracle card readers.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Geat and entertaing book with short stories about the Z war from ery different perspectives and amazing insight into the World wide conscuences and impact of an extinction level event.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Love this movie more each time I see it.  It is so action packed AND hilarious!! Also helps that it has a great cast of actors.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a great book. It doesn't provide a significant amount of new information but it does provide a very good narrative.<br /><br />Also while the author claims to be a Muslim, in his Reddit AMA he pretty much makes it clear he is a believer in religious universalism. By that I mean he believes all religions are ultimately serving the same purpose and worshiping the same God.<br /><br />For the interested Christian readers, he doesn't actually refute the resurrection but instead says that it was this teaching by his followers in particular that allowed Jesus to gain traction over other 'false' Messiahs that were executed in the same time frame. As to whether it actually happened or not, he says that is a matter of faith and not a historical event.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was a very good adaptation of the book.  Very few minor changes from the book to the silver screen.  I really liked the character that they picked for Katniss and the supporting cast was good as well.  The Capitol was portrayed really well which I thought might be an issue for the movie.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|i watched it when i was younger and now my kids enjoy it.  My son will watch it again and again!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love this game. It's great for brain training and its so much fun. I would recommend this game for everyone young and old.
B000026C3T|5.0|This remastered mix of Led Zepplin songs is one of my favorite all time CD's. The sound is great and the selection of songs terrific. Love to play it loud in the car!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|a touch of real class! vintage jazz this album is a must for all jazz lovers. Tremendous musical accompaniment with George Benson at his vocal best.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey, Pride & Prejudice, Forsyte Saga, Anne of Green Gables, you will enjoy this as well. You will probably recognize some of the actors as well. Good story line, interesting characters.
B00000IMTE|2.0|gift for uncle. not my kind of music
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use App and very helpful...it's like having a filing cabinet online. It's easy to share your favorite pins with friends also.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I came searching for a good novel that would be comparable to Vince Flynn.  Daniel Silva had some good reviews and extensive writing history so I decided to try it out.  Daniel's writing style is different than I am used too and that is most of why I listed this as 4 stars.  I would give 5 stars if I planned on reading it again.  I love the main character in the book.  I am currently reading the novel after this one, but I liked The Kill Artist Better
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I was waiting to hear an older voice, cracking at high notes and loosing some feeling. I expected to hear a slower, mellower guitar. Boy was I wrong. His voice is at the top of the game and his licks are superb. He rocks it from beginning to end on both CD's. This set of recordings are just fabulous. You must buy this set, you will love them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game - sooo addicting. My daughter started to play this game and i loved it so much i downloaded it on my kindle as well.
B001EBV0NU|1.0|I dodmt get to view this instant video said my phone was not compatible .

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the entire book and can't wait to finish the trilogy this is definitely a book I will read again and again and again. I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy's collaboration with these fine artists is some of the best all-around blues ever created to date!  Happy belated birthday Buddy!
193413712X|5.0|Creative juggernaut!  It's a novella...sort of...the cadence and the word choice created a feeling, for me, of being inside a dying man's end-of-life thoughts.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it in a single day.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|This may come as a shock to many today who are woefully enamored with todays culture and who think that just because a movie is \\"new\\" it is better than anything before it, but the \\"Batman\\" of 1989 with Keaton and Nicholson is MUCH better than this joke. Ledger did a good albeit OVERLY frightening job as the Joker but Nicholson SMOKES him in acting the part AND staying true to the COMIC BOOK origins of the Joker! Mr. Bale made Bruce Wayne seem like a total A-HOLE who I couldn't even root for. And the ridiculous \\"voice\\" when he was in Batman mode...silly. I am sure I hear the chuckles of the pompous, self-assured detractors of my point of view now, but allow me to state one more simple fact. This character came from a comic book. These things that apparently only twenty-something, career minded nerds or wealthy middle aged men can afford to buy were, in my day, MADE FOR KIDS!!! In, say...1973 I could go to any five and dime, buy a Batman comic for 20 CENTS and go home and read it!! Was it sometimes \\"cheesy\\"? Yes. Campy? Yes. It was geared for an 11 year old boy!! I would not allow my 11 yr old to see this because it is much too disturbing and \\"adult\\". Once again I remind you Batman is a COMIC BOOK character. So, lemmings of todays society, keep telling yourself how great this movie is. I am sure another lemming will believe you. P.S. The old blue and gray Batman costume is so much more cool than the black! And practically anything from pre-1990 is infinitely better(music, movies, comics, clothing, PEOPLE) than anything going today!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Just as Lost got weaker in later seasons, so does The Walking Dead.  The loss of some of the original characters (and the dynamics they brought to the story) is not compensated by the addition of some new ones (mainly The Governor), although Michon is a refreshing new character. The conflict with the Govenor drags on too long and brings this season down a little.  I hope season 4 gets better.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I enjoyed it because it seems to run parallel to Downton Abbey only from the servants lives.  It just shows that no matter your station in life you either do the right thing in life or you don't.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|My hard playing three year loves her unicorn and other Schleich animals. They are virtually unbreakable, although the paint will wear off in some areas. The attention to detail is amazing and this unicorn is beautiful.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this app.  But have one beef! Since last update app. stops. Then when you open<br />it again you lose everything you have done . What's up with that.  Please fix. I have purchased several puzzles and would to work them without starting over each time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an addicting game. The kids and grand kids love it. Cute graphics. Some runs are a little tough for someone not very co-ordinated.
B0097K21YW|2.0|As other reviews have mentioned, this is a fairly standard \\"get 3 stars\\" action-puzzle game.  You try to destroy the buildings on the level with your fireballs for points.<br /><br />I got it as a FAOTD, and it's ok.  My issue is that I put it on my son's tablet and he couldn't play because it requires an open wifi connection.  Our kids don't play any games online and so their tablets have the wifi disabled unless it's needed for something like downloading apps.  There is no chance I'm going to leave the wifi on just so they can play this game.  Also - why?  Why is a constant wifi connection needed?  No explanation is given, and it seems unnecessary and silly for a simple game like this.<br /><br />So, it was deleted.  Too bad.  My son enjoyed it, but there are plenty of apps out there that DON'T have such requirements, so he can play those.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|this is a fun game if you like thinking games. Some of the designs make you think. I like it.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a fun, action packed movie and a new twist on the old fairy tale.  I enjoyed it because I like action adventure with a little comedy added in for good measure and 2 hours of Jeremy Renner helped as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lot's of excitement in this season. I won't spoil the story for anyone, so I'll leave it at this. Picture quality was great, the show is great. And where else can a person learn about the inner workings of British life and still have fun?
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks books and this one was no exception. I will say that this was not one of my favorite of his but it was still good and enjoyable.
B009H442DG|5.0|This is a Great CD,Didn't think I would like it but I do..Of coarse I like the both of them and It was nice to hear the both of them...
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie is just one of the best action ones I have seen in a while!  Highly recommended to all!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|How this every became such a success is beyond me. The sex scenes are mildly titillating, the prose absolutely dire
B000YXMMAO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Radiohead albums so I decided to get it on vinyl.  This album sounds amazing on a record player and was pressed well.  I've bought other newer albums that were just not pressed correctly and the sound was not right (wrong speed or the speed is in waves).  Definitely a must have if you are into vinyls and Radiohead as it has become one of my most listened to records.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I enjoy it every time I watch it. Very interesting characters, good plot development, great accents! I quite enjoy it.
B000E6GCJS|2.0|Maybe my case is special or they have fixed it by now but the vinyl I received was not pressed well.  The sound is not consistent and kind of &#34;wobbles&#34; (slightly speeds up and slows down when playing, not noticeable if you are not really listening but is obvious if you are not distracted).  I was very excited as this was one of the first vinyls I bought from a current band, but when I played it i noticed the sound was not what it should be.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Too crass for my taste. Too much teenage sex, it just was kind of degrading and gross for the female lead.
B000002L5I|5.0|In 1999 just after transferring to a new location, a co-worker told me about Kenny Wayne Shepherd and from then until now I have been a fan.  I have sometimes wondered why he did not breakout nationally or globally way back when, but as we all know...it is never too late.
1609611543|5.0|Very informative and surprising given the emphasis on how good wheat is for you from so many health authorities. I have been off gluten and grains for 2 years and have noticed a lot of improvements in myself.
1616614609|5.0|My wife and I are regular board gamers. We usually play with friends in a group of 4-6.  When alone, we usually settle for a game of scrabble or trivia as most other 2 player games get tedious after a while. We have played Netrunner for a couple of weeks now and absolutely love it. After going through the steep learning curve, we are able to get through a game within an hour. We still get stuck in the details of the rules once in a while and end up making our own resolutions if none of the online faqs address them.<br /><br />We haven't done much deckbuilding yet as the base groupings have kept us entertained well till now. The artwork is gorgeous and card quality is great. We ended up getting a few extra zipper bags to separate out the cards. Looking forward to deckbuilding and upcoming expansions.<br /><br />It's a shame we are not able to play it with our bigger gaming group, but a great addition to our collection for just the two of us.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's fun and addictive can't stop myself from playing got the tablet for the wife she yells at me for playing it more then she does
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Game Is Kool but haven't beaten the first one yet lol So hopely I beat it soon ts Nice
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game was awesome!  I played through all of the levels in the first day.  I wish there were more.  You really have to look ahead in moves to solve a lot of these.  I WANT MORE! :-)
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|some of these disks skip.... and the picture distorts sometimes. I haven't found a thumbprint or a scratch so there must just be something wrong with some of the disks. Other than that I am absolutely mad about this series, and have gotten some friends hooked on it to :) The boxes are in good condition. But I would like to trade out the bad disks.. :/
B003ZSJ212|5.0|First off, I'm genuinely a fan of all 3 prequels, in fact, Revenge of The Sith is my favorite in the whole series. I also have no problem with any of the Special Edition changes, except for Greedo Shot First. As for the set itself, obviously, the picture and sound are absolutely superb. You are missing out if you watch Star Wars in any other way. The extras are almost worth the money by themselves, this has just about any information on Star Wars you can possibly want; effects documentaries, prop and concept art galleries, one of which actually has the entire animated segment from The Star Wars Holiday Special, there's, of course, also many deleted scenes, and interviews, which are always welcome. My personal favorite extra is a compilation of different Star Wars parodies and spoofs ranging from Clerks, to SNL, and Robot Chicken.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|It is the next best thing from seeing Phantom of the Opera live. I was afraid at first that the camera would be static, but it offers a variety of views that make the preformance very enjoyable.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Just love this final book of sukie and her friends. The author really delivered. I  am so grateful  it was not like other authors that have bland finalities. Just a great read
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best puzzle game by far! I can't wait until the sequel in the fall 2013. The bar is pretty high, i hope they can deliver.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I had little issues with first loading but. now working great great game for anyone who liked the movies .
B00992CF6W|2.0|I bought this game expecting something comperable to minecraft on the computer and I was incredibly dissapointed. I'll grant that some of it runs smoothly but for the most part it is awefull. The worlds are tiny, there are lots of bugs, and simply moving around needs work. All of these problems are fixable and perhapse in some later update it will all be better, but until then I have to say IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO ENJOY EVEN HALF AS MUCH AS THE ORIGINAL MINECRAFT DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR SEVEN BUCKS!!
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I was first introduced to this book as a homework reading by a Tuck business school professors who is specialized on marketing.  This book really inspires a happiness journey for me intellectually and in real life.  Tony first uses his his own Zappos story to demonstrate how he and his team formed and implemented these happiness principals and culture in their business.  Then he leads readers to some basic principals on Positive Psychology, and inspires the reader for further exploring in the positive psychology field.  In today's business environment, this reading is helpful for any business that focuses on customer service.  Also recommend other positive psychology reading, such as the one by Professor Tal Ben-Sharhar.  His popular Positive Psychology course at Harward is also available as a public open online course.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|The strange title almost put me off, but I am glad I did buy it. It is an excellent story and full of black humour. The Gordonston ladies meet every afternoon in the park, where their dogs play together. The ladies sit at a table, sipping their cocktails discreetly hidden in plastic cups, and discussing the latest antics of their neighbours. All very innocent or so it seems on the surface, but everyone has their own secrets, including murder. Many twists and turns keep you guessing right to the end. I do feel that the book could have stood another editing to remove some of the repetitious wording, but overall it didn't spoil the story; it was still a good read.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great mystery that leaves you curious til the end. I only gave 4 stars because after reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn I was expecting to be blown away again. Still a great read, just didn't live up to Flynn's newest novel.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Reprise, Allan Douglas, AuthenticHendrix, Sony, have been issuing posthumous recordings for 43 years now.  As a Hendrix fan since '67, and having seen him live, I have a few opinions.  This release shows where Hendrix was attempting to get to after the Experience broke up.  Financial pressures from managers, record companies, & Jimi's own expenditures for Electric Lady forced him to reverse course on several occasions to gather more cash during the final year of his life.  Band of Gypsys is a fun recording but it wouldn't have happened without the lawsuit won by Capital Records. The last tour was demanding and also not the direction that Jimi was wanting to pursue.  Trying to record between gigs, but tired, worn out, depressed - and we know the rest of the story.  This recording shows much more than: Cry of Love, Rainbow Bridge, First Rays, Voodoo Soup, etc..., the streams of music that Jimi was trying to pull from to create a new whole cloth.  Some of the cuts are not going to appeal to fans wanting more Experience/Gypsys music.  But many of the cuts are like having a decently recorded live recording from this period - much more than all those bootleg Dagger releases.  If you are a fan of the Band of Gypsys you will enjoy listening to Hendrix, Buddy, & Billy, getting it together.  The only cut that doesn't belong is the Lonnie Youngblood track. But it's enjoyable on it's own - so not a big deal.  Also, there are good liner notes on each track instead of the now nauseating retreading of Hendrix history from 66-1970. The mixing by Kramer has lot of air in it which allows the instruments to come thru cleanly and there doesn't appear to be any over-compensating bass.  The vocals are also clear which makes it fun to listen to Jimi sing his lyrics.  This recording, more than any other since Jimi's death, makes me sad & melancholy for what might have been.
031237674X|5.0|I found this book well-written and interesting. For those who are already true believers in reincarnation, it will provide support. For those who are skeptical, there are cases that are hard to explain away. The author does offer a variety of explanations that might be possible: families colluding to fool the researchers, or self-deception. However, the book's view is clearly that there is something going on in many cases, across multiple cultures, that suggests at least the possibility of memories of past lives. The research reminds me of accounts of near death experiences. There hasn't been any definitive proof either in research on near death experiences  or here,  but there is evidence that is suggestive of something going on that we can't easily explain. When a child is born who can remember how to speak another language from a past life that the parents/friends/relatives don't speak,  then all bets are off.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has done more for the private-eye genre with this new novel than any other contemporary writer in the field!
0792838068|5.0|The 1st time I ever saw this movie (in theaters) I was blown away. The acting was by far the best Nic Cage has ever done imo. He deserved an Oscar for this movie. And Elizabeth Shue should have gotten an Emmy or something for her role as well.<br />It DEF makes you think twice about abusing alcohol or drugs if your life is in the crapper.  Turn to Jesus. He works miracles.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|No special permissions and an awesome pixel puzzle, what else can one ask for? Just more upgrades/achievements forever! Two thumbs up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love Downton Abbey and are hanging on, eager to watch each unfolding episode.  Can't wait for Season 4 to start soon!
0740748475|5.0|all the calvin & hobbes comic strips put togheter in these amazing volumes. First thing youll notice is that this thing is HEAVY!  its definetely worth the money.
140006922X|1.0|The Author was caught in an interview being deceptive about his \\"academic\\" background to begin with and reading the work certainly shows that attempted defaming the historic Jesus as well as the biblical faith was at least one of his agendas. This is not a serious work, although the author expressing his opinion is certainly acceptable.<br /><br />Save your money and time if you are truly interested in factual research concerning the topic matter.<br /><br />I did not even pass my copy on to another I was so disappointed..<br /><br />Yet, stay encouraged there are many great text that are factual to be had and Amazon is the place to both find as well as purchase them.<br /><br />----After very quick comments and attacks from some as well as a \\"PROVE IT\\" concerning the author from the same I am adding the following to help verify any further questions...<br /><br />Reza Aslan Misrepresents His Scholarly Credentials - Fact<br />Aslan does have four degrees, as Joe Carter has noted: a 1995 B.A. in religion from Santa Clara University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa and wrote his senior thesis on \\"The Messianic Secret in the Gospel of Mark\\"; a 1999 Master of Theological Studies from Harvard; a 2002 Master of Fine Arts in Fiction from the University of Iowa; and a 2009 Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br /><br />None of these degrees is in history, so Aslan's repeated claims that he has \\"a Ph.D. in the history of religions\\" and that he is \\"a historian\\" are false.  Nor is \\"professor of religions\\" what he does \\"for a living.\\" He is an associate professor in the Creative Writing program at the University of California, Riverside, where his terminal MFA in fiction from Iowa is his relevant academic credential. It appears he has taught some courses on Islam in the past, and he may do so now, moonlighting from his creative writing duties at Riverside. Aslan has been a busy popular writer, and he is certainly a tireless self-promoter, but he isnowhere known in the academic world as a scholar of the history of religion. And a scholarly historian of early Christianity? Nope.<br /><br />What about that Ph.D.? As already noted, it was in sociology. What about his dissertation? i It is a 140-page work titled \\"Global Jihadism as a Transnational Social Movement: A Theoretical Framework.\\" If Aslan's Ph.D. is the basis of a claim to scholarly credentials, he could plausibly claim to be an expert on social movements in twentieth-century Islam. He cannot plausibly claim, as he did to Lauren Green, that he is a \\"historian,\\" or is a \\"professor of religions\\" \\"for a living.\\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Again, this is not a truthful Author, differently not an \\"historian\\", and not a book for the serious minded.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing best strategy game I ever played the graphics are good and I hope there's another one
B009AMAJVO|4.0|Great movie with some wonderful twists. You get action, emotional involvement, complete character development. All of this with an excellent storyline. Cue it up and crank the volume, Farrell's brogue can be a low growl and difficult to understand at times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because  it really challenges your thinking and it makes you see things in deferment ways. It also makes you use you brain and try and figure our how things fit together. Even though this game uses your mental abilities I think it is a fun game to play to try and relax.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun. I love the minions in the movie, and when I heard there was a game about them I got so excited. In this game you help one minion become the minion of the year. You have to dodge obstacles and defeat enemies. This is a must get game.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Today is my birthday ok well tell me happy birthday ok hAppy birthday you have a birthday party when is  ah tom a pool party I can not come because I cannot be in water for long you can have it in Harry's water park I have to ask will what you waiting fir they said that  they have it Tom I can come yeah
B002VPE1X4|5.0|Plenty of room to store the digital camera and battery separately! Besides the main camera compartment, there is a front pocket, which can be used to store the battery when not in use and extra memory cards if needed. Also a slimmer compartment behind the main camera compartment, which could be used to hold a thin camera manual or just the strap of the digital camera. The case has a strap and also an opening to attach to a belt. Provides basic protection to the digital camera from short drops and dust.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Intriguing and well played out. Julianna is at her best. Hopefully, this show will last a long time. Bravo! Encore!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Wouldn't be that bad if it didn't have to buffer every two seconds.<br />I can't even watch anything without having it to stop.<br />This app ain't that great, sorry.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this story. It was a quick read I couldn't put down. Would of liked to know what happened to Wendy. King did not disappoint this constant reader.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Most people watch movies because of the actors in them or it's a series.  So I watched this one for both reasons. So the bottom line it was ok, just ok.  Not worth buying and watching over and over again, but a one time rental worth it.  I give it the 3 stars for the action and comedy, well not the intended comedy I think but a couple of parts that made me laugh.  It's a movie not a long term relationship, so go watch it with the kids.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|a gothic tale of what terrible things can happen to a young boy in a dysfunctional world. and how do those experiences affect his entire life. some of these events seem over drawn to the point that i couldn't believe it was more than a terrible fairy tale.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Had never played this game before and love it!! You really have to concentrate and the solutions do not come easily.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|This movie was a disappointment.  If you have time on your hands, you may find parts of the movie worthwhile.  Includes dysfuntion of a fifties family.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is a great time-killer. I love getting the little tokens to play the slot game! It's really fun:-) I definitely recommend this app to anyone who enjoys.. well... FUN! 5 stars!!! :-):-)
B006Z7XNVK|1.0|The acting was good, but acting alone without a good plot can't make a good movie.  Don't waste your time and money on this movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really like this app because you can use it whenever your bored and its a fun and challenging game
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I found the game rather boring.  I have already deleted it from my kindle.  Make it more interesting and I May try it again.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I wanted a way to print from my kindle to the wireless laser printer on our home network.  This app does the trick nicely.  It was easy to use and I was up and printing nearly instantly once it was installed.
0307951529|5.0|Chris, I know you are reading this - and I just want to say, you're awesome!<br /><br />Anyway - the book is good.  It's certainly given me more information about how to tackle the launch of my business.  Go buy the book - if you take one positive idea that you didn't have before you bought the book, it would have been worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I'm glad it didn't cost anything.  I haven't played the game but once since it has you purchase add-ins and I haven't had time to figure that out and stop it.  Don't want to buy additional anythings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Interesting levels, great graphics, challenging, and a lotnof fun to play.  Just don't regally like hownsome of thenmissions require you to invite or beat friends.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I looked at a few piano apps. I picked this one because there was no delay when playing on my kindle fire hd, and it allows you to play chords. I didn't think I would use the built-in songs, but they are really fun. And the keyboard looks great!
B005LAII44|5.0|THE STORY IS GREAT. YOU LAUGH AND GET MADE AT THE SAME TIME. ACTION IS OFF THE NOOK. YOU WILL ENJOY EVERY MINUTE. ENJOY
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Ideal basic calculator - my fat fingers love the big keys. If you use your kindle fire for anything besides books, this is a must-have.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have found this app to be very useful for the Fire. It will wake you up. It does what it says it will do. Best of all, it's free!
B00D41AJ7G|2.0|I went through the first 38 puzzles very quickly. 39 to44 were the only levels I found to be challenging. Even those levels went fairly quickly because the solution is similar on each level. Thank goodness this was free.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I feel a little behind the times as this book has been out for some time and tons of other people have already raved about it.  But I'm still glad I got to it and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />This was a perfect book for me because, as much as I love books, I also adore technology and gadgets and the internet and my eReader.  In this book you get both and I liked that it was a nice, complementary blend, not books vs. technology.  That being said, I think this book will eventually be really dated, so I'd encourage you to read it sooner rather than later.<br /><br />As for the characters, I really liked everyone in the book.  I don't think they were that well drawn because it's not really a character-driven book.  Of course Mr. Penumbra was awesome and even though I felt I didn't learn that much about him, he really grew on me and just seeing his name mentioned or having him appear for a few minutes in a scene made me smile.<br /><br />The mystery at the center of the book wasn't as epic as I'd expected but all the other elements were so perfect that it didn't even matter.  I loved how fake books were incorporated and there was a literary puzzle involved.  I actually wanted to find those books and read them but then realized they didn't really exist.<br /><br />So if you love books as well as technology and are intrigued by the idea of a 24-hour bookstore as well as literary mysteries and secret societies, this book will be perfect for you!
B00CATSONE|5.0|i really didnt know a lot about nikola tesla before reading this book.  i knew his name but not what he did.  everyone knows thomas edison because of his original ideas and his enormous influence.  i wonder how much more advanced in technology we would be if edison would have partnered with tesla instead of screwing him over.  tesla didnt care about the money from a patent just the improvement to humanity.  this is why my title is nice guys finish last.  tesla ended up alone and penniless but he never gave up on his dreams.  this was a very well written book and a quick read.  i recommend this book for all would-be-geniuses.
B00452VF4O|5.0|Narrating the life and love of Simon de Montfort, this second part of the Welsh Prince trilogy truelly moved me to tears. Its the best one of the three, it's a well balanced story: historically acurate and beautifully told.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this app!! the only thing is I'm stuck on level 29...can anyone help me??????? I also love how cute some of the balls you have to make are
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much but not an easy read. Difficult at times to follow characters and understand why<br />they were included.<br />Not as fluid as Hossein's early books.
0785153942|4.0|After seeing the movie in IMAX 3D, I was completely blown away.  I had to find out more about the back story on the characters, creatures, and, of course, the Jaegers.  The graphic novel, Tales From Year Zero, is a great start.  Way too short, however.<br /><br />Would be 5 stars if more Kaiju and Jaegers.<br /><br />Raleigh and Yancy back story is kind of weak.<br /><br />Worth the price of ~ 14 bucks.  Check it out!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wish there more of these kind of shows on tv.<br />Superb acting, story of  realistic events in british history
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Of course the music is great without a doubt. What made it even better is the price that I was able to buy it for.  Prompt service and a definite way to purchase your favorite tunes. This will be the way that I buy music from here on out for sure.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|One the best CDs I have erer bought. Can not stop listening to it. I love every song on the playlist.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I love this tripod I just love it now I can't take video wile twerking and the camera will not shake
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|totally biased book.... written by a Christian hating Muslim, and Muslims do not believe Jesus is the Son of God...... can't believe anyone is giving this jerk any attention
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I am enjoying the game. They try to get money early in the game. But it is fun. I play it daily
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I have watch over 4 times. This is powerful  and true I have recommend to others. Who have enjoy it to.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've grown to love Gideon and Eva as much as I loved Ana and Christian in FSoG. The storyline just gets better and better. Ms. Day is a fantastic writer. The emotion she expresses in her writing puts you in the story, makes you a part of the story. I can't wait for the next installment.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Surprisingly, better than expected quality!  The mUSB cable/connector was incredibly solid (doesn't wiggle like some other flimsy chargers).  Charges up my phone (Galaxy S3 Verizon) very fast- notably faster than my previous charger (the popular Motorola charger from amazon).
0465011055|5.0|There is no question that this book should be read by every adult. Sonetimes we take for granted our freedoms and need to be aware how quickly they can be taken away. This is a personal account of a person who survived terrible odds and lived to share them with us.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|everything I wanted. feeling good and the two end are excellent to use.  I use it on my kindle and other electronics.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|After all th  hype from the reviews, and I checked quite a few reviews, the controls were a little tricky to use. That's why I gave it 3 stars. I played the road, on easy during the day beat it the second time. It was fun but I didn't like that the slender man teleported around. Would be more creepy at night, in the dark, alone. I would like to see a few more maps though.
B005DJREJS|1.0|No values what so ever in this sitcom. I watched 10 minutes of this and turned it off right away. Shows like this promote all the wrong ideas into our teens minds.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|All you have  to do is move left and right avoiding zombies and the starting perks are awesome. I suggest that you don't use the head start perk until later missions. But my question is.... is there a point that you get to the tower?
0307887448|5.0|I am not a fan of fantasy or science fiction but this book is so well done it was hard to put down.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This game is lots of fun. It does need more levels. Only 44 levels..... I was done in under 2 hours.
0143120530|4.0|Very interesting story about the memory championships and how people are able to remember long lists of random things.  I found myself even using a few of the techniques occasionally.
B00BRR66SA|2.0|Only liked the mirror song and suit and tie. I was expecting the whole album to be of similar caliber, however, I was disappointed.
B00DU73T08|3.0|I enjoyed this movie for the most part, but just like the Twilight series it was very light on plot depth. There's no real explanation of how the aliens got a foothold on Earth given the complex technological set up they have and how the symbiotes enter humans.  It was hard to understand how they could have all their technology with them as well given they basically travel in tiny silver pods between worlds..<br /><br />Of course every one of the main characters is gorgeous.  And the bad guys are converted in the end.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is awesome I love it I have it on my iPod it is very addicting get it now!!
1451695195|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating 'what more is there to life'. Good reading from front to back.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Works like a charm, great deal. Inside of case gets those little balls that clothes can get after drying em, but I don't care, as Its either closed, or I'm looking at the screen. Good case for a good price.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Fun premise, over the top action, and Malkovich is beyond amazing in his supporting role- it is worth the watch just for him.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Makes me a better Christian,  gives me peace of mind,  humbles me, gives me patience,  knowing the reward at the end, being with God, and my Family who are christians.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was a breeze. I took the Chromecast out of the box with the included USB cable, plugged it into the side HDMI port on my TV, plugged the USB into the port right next to it. A few moments later I had downloaded the Chromecast app from the Google play store, it had me select the wireless network to use and then I was good to go.<br /><br />I've tried all of the available apps that work with Chromecast thus far (Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Music & Movies), and they all work without a hitch. You just click the little icon in the upper right of each app, it connects and either waits for you to select something, or starts playing what you already have selected. I was especially excited that my 6k+ songs stored in Google Music stream perfectly as well.<br /><br />The part that made me most excited about all this is you don't need to start or stop apps like you have to with most SmartTVs, you just hop on a phone or tablet, select what you want, and off you go watching/listening to stuff on your TV. Even better is it will actually turn your TV on for you if you have HDMI CEC enabled which is quite handy.<br /><br />Having used the Chromecast for the past couple of days, I can say this was one of the best purchases I've made in a while and I would recommend this to anyone who extensively uses Google services especially, as it will not disappoint.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love this movie a lot!!!  I am glad I ordered this for my personal collection.  It's worth the money.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Light read with some strong moments. Vivid imagery and delightful characters. I would recommend this book as a quick escape.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Very Challenging, Very Fun. A must download game for those who like crosswords, sudoku, and other challenging thinking type games.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This volume is as good as its predecessors.  Martin has so far surpassed Jordan in current Epic fantasy, though like Jordan, he may pass the ideal point for a conclusion.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|great game good graphics but they want that you pay for all, they have to change the cost of the coins
B004HO6I4M|2.0|This copy I purchased skips sometimes. The movie is great...my daughter loves it. Just skips and gets a bit annoying.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|its great and very helpful i was waitting for this app a lot of time ago and this is exactly what we need
1451683405|1.0|sam harris has done some excellent work in the past ,most notably end of faith.The more he writes however the more he seems to become less interesting.End of faith is a master stroke.a work told brilliantly about a subject most dont dare to tread.His following works, letters to s christain nation and moral landscape make good points but are inferior to end of faith.With his latest work free will he struggles mightily to make a point not worth making or which he(and we) is incapable of making.It is mental masturbation at best and a vanity work.Love sam harris but you can skip this one.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter spends hours on this app and she loves it!  The cost for the full version is a little steep but the free version does the trick for a couple hours.
0792844890|5.0|This movie is a humor classic. Need I say more? Good condition, no problems with the product. Such a great movie for a great price!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the other by same author!!!!! Very good and entertaining, it's a very quick read.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Man I love Blu-Ray! Maybe I'm still so new to the whole scene but the sound and video quality on this is amazing. No problems with the product's condition or quality. Works great. Only minor downfall was that no sleeve was included with the BRD. Not a major deal at all. My kids would probably destroy it anyway.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Great game really gives you a challenge, need to have really sharp eyes to spot or reduce what you need to find.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl is a remarkable literary achievement.<br />It draws you into the intricacies of what constitutes a troubled marriage, but in compiling a delicious ‘he said-she said’ Flynn has also brought to relief the pop idiosyncrasies that make her fiction and America such a delight. The reference to the economic bust, the ham-fisted move from New York City to Missouri, the hunky small-town hubby versus the urbane bitch, dysfunctional families on both ends – all merge to create a page-turner that will have you up until dawn.<br />Without spoiling it for readers, if you haven’t read Gillian Flynn this is the book you ought to pick up first. And yes, I’ve downloaded Dark Places on my Kindle too and that’s equally engrossing.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this but it was really cheesy, and awful.  They should have done a much better job, in honor of the original movie.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|After the in app purchase the download videos feature don't work, I don't see a way to recover the coins for my purchase.<br /><br />Besides that huge fail, the interface is fairly good and sadly the app is buggy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|People may say it is bad but it's wee perfect if you like tasks and games and need a place to play<br />Love nine year old tiffany
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If anyone's a fan of the movie (and Temple Run) they would love this game. Lots of fun but very addicting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I started reading Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, for a few reasons. Some friends like it, Card's statements about political issues were in the news, so on. I picked it up, and read it. It was very thought-provoking and entertaining, to say the least.<br /><br />As the book starts, it is late in the 21st century, and the planet earth has already been the victim of two invasions by the Formics, an insect like alien creature. The Formics, derogatorily called the \\"buggers\\" by the people of earth, are feared and there is a constant lookout for the next invasion that many believe to be inevitable. In this environment, the best and brightest children are recruited to go to \\"battle school\\" and then further education, where they will learn how to command fleets and personnel in any future war against the buggers.<br /><br />This environment as well is rife with some dystopian themes such as a very soft, yet entirely too efficient, suppression of religion and population controls. There is, of course, the horror of child soldiers and psychological abuse, which we'll discuss in a moment. Into this setting, we have Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, a young boy who is called a \\"Third\\" for being a rare child beyond the two per family limit normally enforced. He is sent to school to learn to fight the buggers.<br /><br />It was weird to see this little boy used up like a wrung-out rag by the government, and to consider whether this was justified or not. The narrative, and the characters themselves, seem to wrestle with this as well. At heart, Ender was just a pawn in the machinations of those who feared they had to commit genocide to save humanity.<br /><br />Of course, that is where the interesting part comes in. The sympathetic truths that were eventually revealed by Ender were not known at this point in the story, and yet the military leadership who were convinced that they were doing the right thing still had doubts. One of the main points of this series is that war is not fun or pretty. It's messy and ruthless.<br /><br />I have criticized certain characters or people who have what I consider warped views of martial matters, and that made our protagonist all the more disturbing, in a way. Ender was, arguably, the moral ideal of a military commander. Yet he could be, and was, ruthless and efficient in the art of warfare. The empathy and imagination that made him so morally upright, also made him, in the right settings, a coldly precise military commander. Of course, part of the reason this is has to due with the reveal at the end of the novel, so we'll leave that alone.<br /><br />To say that Card paints a very depressing picture of humanity is an understatement. But this wasn't some \\"humans are the real monsters\\" trope either. When I finished the book, I wondered if the Formics weren't the good guys and the military leadership who so hurt Ender and other children, the bad guys. It is something to mull over, as I'm sure those who have finished the book will so do.<br /><br />As for the military training and such aspects, it was fairly realistic, within the confines of the fictional and dystopian settings. Though there were no NCO's (Non-Commissioned Officers) per se listed, the concept of them was very much in play. The \\"toon\\" leaders and sub-leaders with autonomy enough to work within Ender's command were an example of how real-life NCO's work in battle within their units. Of course, there are some plot points that would never fly in real life, and the reader will quickly guess which ones.<br /><br />War is hell, the old phrase goes, but sometimes it is necessary. The real struggle, besides, and perhaps more than, the battle, is the struggle to not lose one's morality, one's humanity, in the fight. Often ruthless decisions are required, so how can one fight like a heartless killer, yet not truly be heartless? Not truly lose their souls? That is a quandary that Ender's Game presents, but doesn't answer. We, the reader, must answer that questionfor ourselves.for ourselves.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Enjoyed this very much. While it may be only fiction, It may certainly be a little too realistic for my tastes.
B005LAII4E|2.0|I was expecting there are more new characters from both G.I.Joe and Cobra in the sequel but instead they got rid of Destro and Duke so fast. And that leave \\"The Rock\\" almost running the whole movie. What the heck?? I know he is very popular and you can see him in almost every movie, but it is just way too much, getting sick of it. Very disappointed. Anyway, I love the first one better.
0553801473|5.0|I wish the paper back was already out but it isn't.  My wife finished book for so we had to buy book 5 hard cover.<br /><br />Daenerys will make you want to ripe out your hair.  Maybe that is just great writing.  She acts how you would expect a young person to act.  Zero logic and all emotion.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I'm quite pleased with it; it has just about everything you can want from a Sudoku app and then some (i.e. some pretty interesting puzzles I hadn't seen before).  The apps well designed, and I have yet to experience any hiccups or issues.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Have used a few different Divers watches but they're either Seiko automatics or quartz. This is my first solar watch and I really like it. The size is just perfect. No need for batteries!
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|&#34;Speak to&#34;  me song is my favorite, but other songs I love too. They have not changed, still the same good music and Marie still  singing very good.<br />I hope that we will hear from Roxette soon with more new music. This music gives me more strength and keeps me optimistic.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is a genre I do not typically read, so perhaps I did not love the book for this reason.  It is compelling in that you what to keep reading, but I thought the story lacked character development and depth.  I would have enjoyed reading a more robust novel.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|I was wondering what happened after so many years..  But Roxette is back and still very good, excellent! I hope  Roxette will produce more music in future!
B0091REZMW|4.0|An engaging game with many ways to play. None of the same old repetative play. Graphics are detailed which enhance game play. My only downside is you have to have friends.I don't know anyone who plays this game.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Pretty cool game that actually requires some thought and reasoning. Some puzzles were difficult to do if you aren't using a stylus.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|From the sight of the first Kaiju (monster) I was hooked, all I can say is it must be seen at least once on the big screen to get what I'm saying ,its not full of that romantic mess, like ALL movies today but it has appropriate emotion for this type of movie, action NON STOP! I'm going again and I never waste money in a theater that's all I can say!
B003DNH6DK|1.0|The movie is great (4 stars) but I had to rent from iTunes so I could watch it in HD. It makes no sense that I can't watch HD movie from my MacBook Air with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />So, at the end I paid 2 rents (Amazon Prime and iTunes) to watch 1 movie. As you can probably see, I am very unhappy with Amazon Prime.
B000B589JI|5.0|I needed a smaller canister to carry Zippo fuel since I have limited space in my kit.  This is perfect and provides me with a refill for my eternal match and my hand warmer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this for my 6 year old that loves horses and we have BOTH been having a lot of fun playing this family oriented game.  The gameplay is intuitive, educational, and fun!
1439156816|5.0|Great Book to read about Stephen King's life. Well written and inspirational. In the back he has books that he has read and recommends.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Let's face it, you can't go wrong with a Spielberg film.  This is no exception.  Excellent, unique story angle and very good casting help bring this story forward at an exciting clip.  I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The novel started out okay but quickly became a frustrating read.  The story could have been summed up 1/2 way thru instead it lingered on.  Way too much drama!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun and if you like/love challenging and tricky games you will,love this game some people might think its like 100 floors but it's not !
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Having used Evernote for years now, I can't say I've ever been disappointed by this product. It does exactly what it says. I have spent years as a Microsoft Access power user, designing and building databases to track all kinds of information. Yet I am still finding new ways to use Evernote to do most everything, from building research collections to clipping photos for later publication to writing fiction to building project to-do lists.<br /><br />With the extensions and browser add-ons, adding data to Evernote is only a click or two. Save the entire page you're reading, or just an image, or whatever you select. I have a premium membership, and I can use images to store several key books that are prime sources for my work. Using text recognition, Evernote includes the book hits in my search results.<br /><br />Using tags has simplified a great deal of work, as well, because it makes it very easy to place the notes you capture to the topics that they apply to. One other key point: Being able to access my notes from any Internet browser is something I could only dream of doing with MS Access. Using it on a Kindle Fire is just one more reason to love Evernote.<br /><br />If I was forced to pick only one software to use for the rest of my life (besides a web browser), it wouldn't be MS Office, or Adobe Photoshop, or anything else. It would be Evernote. It's just that useful!
B0058VW36U|1.0|this app failed to download on my kindle fire and all I had in my wallet was fives so I went through a lot of trouble to get a dollar to give to my mom from the app. so I tried to download it. and it said &quot; cut the rope failed to download&quot;. don't get this app on ur kindle fire u will not get your dollar back

B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a very good app, for the people who have the 0.6.0 or older updates what you have to do is 1. Go to updates and update it 2. Remove from device and then download it back or 3. I'm not sure but maybe if you turn off the kindle and then turn it on it MIGHT update<br /><br />What I don't get is why can't I use the realms?<br /><br />PEWDIEPIE ROCKS
B000PFU7OO|3.0|Loved the movie.  Love some of the music. Wish it had had a more satisfying ending.  Kind of sad finish.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|1. You cannot compare kid's movies- plain and simple (unless the movie is part of a series).<br />2. The characters are diverse, there is great cast and as an adult it's always fun to name the voices and hear an actor/ actress go beyong the screen.<br />3. What a wonderful and heartfelt moral, it's just disappointing that this movie isn't as popular as other kid's movies.
B00785P2QC|5.0|So fun! Addicting for sure, once you start you can't stop. I can play for hours long and you don't get bored! Highly recommend
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I really love sci-fi movies and this was a home run kid friendly, alien, sci-fi family movie!<br />The characters were relatable, the plot moved along nicely, it definitely had some good laughs and I would recommond for movie night.<br /><br />...I loved this move so much that I named my dog after Stitch. It turned out to be so fitting since my dog is a total sweetheart but also a complete captain destroyer clutz! This movie and my dog will always be near and dear to my heart for that very reason.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|If you love Phill Collins then this is the download for you.All of his best songs are here and for a great price. Worth a whole lot more.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I will start off by saying that this movie plot was nothing I expected based on the trailers. Because of this, it kind of ruined my expectations of the movie, until I watched it a couple more times. WARNING: do not watch this movie until you have emotionally prepared yourself for some crying, choking up and possible personal reflection of your own relationships/ family dynamics.<br /><br />Moving on. I used to live in Europe and hearing the accents in a kid's movie was fantastic! What a great cast as well! (I immidiately recognized Kelly Macdonald's voice from Boardwalk Empire and fell in love). Overall, the movie was great, a little bit sad for a family movie but defenitely one I wish came out when I was a little girl. Never the less, I am old and this was definetly a bonding movie for my mom and I.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is ok if you want to here every aspect of a person's life. A lot of things mentioned on Facebook should probably left unsaid
1594487154|5.0|This is a great book.  Should be read by everyone who manages or owns a business, and should be required reading for all sales personnel.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I have been stuck on Level 29 for weeks. Also I can't load it on my Kindle fire Please make it a little easier to find all the jellies. I have gotten as high as 130,000 pts and still didn't get past the level.
B003JQLHY0|5.0|My primary watch is a Rolex Submariner. I love it but it isn't appropriate for all situations. I love automatic, mechanical watches so for 1/40th the price of my Rollie I gave this one a shot and I have to say, Seiko makes a fine time piece. I'll be tracking it over the next few days for accuracy. It's a great looking watch. The rubber band is sporty and I like that it lays flat unlike my G-Shock.  If you want an automatic, mechanical dive watch for less than $250 this is the one for you.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The twitter app work great on all my devices.<br />I can say honestly I would recommend this app to anyone that uses Twitter.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies from my youth. The story follows the book reasonable close. What child won't want to have this adventure - pirates, Indians - being able to fly - this movie has it all!<br /><br />The picture is VERY good - probably as good, if not better, than when it was first shown in the theaters. I've owned this on tape, DVD and now blu-ray.<br /><br />The night scenes over London remind me of the ride in Disney World - quite simply they are beautiful.<br /><br />Some of the songs, notably 'You Can Fly', fits the story almost like they were written when the book was!<br /><br />This is a movie for the ages. Certainly this is a movie all childern (and those young at heart) should see several times in their life. The lessions it has are timeless as well.<br /><br />The movie came quickly and in perfect shape - all at a unbeatable price.<br /><br />I would rate this a very strong 9.0 to 9.25 out of 10.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is a fun read almost all the way through.  I saw where the ending was supposed to go, but I don't feel the author was completely successful: I didn't buy the motivations.  However, given how fun the first 85% is, having the final 15% of it  as &#34;just fine,&#34; still makes it worth a read - - and a good one at that.
B005USZML4|3.0|I expected the usual Grisham type of lawyer story. Instead, it was about a young boy. Not too bad, just juvenile.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Another great book from George R.R. Martin! I again didn't make it through the book before the show started(about mid way through the book, again). The show didn't follow quite as closely this time but the book was way better in my opinion. If you enjoyed the first book this is almost an insta-buy! If you didn't read the first book, do so then pick this one up too.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|When I started the Kitchen House (it had been recommended highly by a friend) I couldn't see what the fuss was about. I found it confusing with all the different characters. But, after I got further into it (after Lavinia grew up) I really got into it. I haven't finished it, but look forward to see what will happen next.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great start to what hopes to be an amazing book series. I started the book before watching the show on HBO but mid way thought the book the show started and I could not resist the temptation to watch the show before finishing the book. If you too enjoy the show but haven't read the book, get the book. The show is almost verbatim  from the book, but of course the book adds more and let's your imagination make up the world with in!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|Same as above. Disappointing. Juvenile. Ungrishamlike. I expect Grisham to give me exciting lawyer stories. I will not read the third part.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I've owned this for 8 months, and up until a few days ago, I'd have recommended this amp to anyone.  As far as how it amplifies and the sound quality is puts out, it is really amazing.  However today it died on me.  I can't get to turn on or respond.  The red light comes on when I plug it in to charge, but it won't turn on.  I've left it plugged in to charge for over a day and still nothing.  It's a lot of money to shell out for an electronic that dies in eight months.  You've been warned, buy at your own risk.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Ended up getting this because I was not fond of WeatherBug.  This program is &#34;okay.&#34;  It close to what the actual weather ends up being but isn't as spot on as...say...the local weather station.  But it works...
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book is overwhelming in it's portrayal of war torn Afghanistan and the effects on it's people.  The plight of women is so brutally told.

B00DULWFZE|5.0|Been a BSB fan since they exploded on the the music scene 20 years ago and have missed their signature sound in recent years. The boys return with a solid A+ effort. I won't break it all down, there's a few good reviews that have done so perfectly. Love their more mature & acoustic sound, and the wide variety of styles they have chosen for this CD. Glad Kevin is back, just wasn't the same without him. BSB still got it, their harmonies are second to none in the boy band genre. Great comeback album, my favorites are the new single In A World Like This & Breathe.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app and easy to use.  you can read your kindle on the beach and easily deck the weather to plan the next days activities while on vacation.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Super easy to use, especially to store my photography sessions. Having access made it easy to show my clients their photos without making them wait for the actual disc
B005PK57IK|5.0|The characters are so well portrayed, and while every episode is about a new court case, the ongoing story lines are still strongly in play.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was good, Written well and very interesting. I was hooked after just a few pages. Sort of reminded me of a James Patterson novel.

B0041KKYGU|5.0|I loved this movie and it arrived quickly. Not only was it a great price for such an hilarious film but the shipping was cheap as well.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It was okay, becuase I like Denzel; however, it wasn't a great movie. Glad I didn't pay the expensive charges to go to the movies to see it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is sooooo fun!!!!  this game is temple run and subway surf combined!! I bought this game recently and i live it!!!
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|No doubt that Anthony Ryan is going to have a long and recognised career as an author in this genre of fantasy fiction!<br />From the very beginning I could not put the book down - imagine my dismay to see that the sequel is not out for a while, I think I may re-read this novel before then :)<br />A whole world with many fascinating characters and storylines - especially that of the main character and his journey. What is yet to come from this author will be eagerly awaited by myself!
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|There are enough reviews of the movie itself, and I'm not going to rehash them. Suffice it to say, it's a classic mid-1980s goofball comedy, with some definite sci-fi cred.<br /><br />This version, the Blu-ray Mastered in 4K disc, is really quite nice. The one key thing that I noticed (and that I love) is that they left the film grain intact. Many people will find this objectionable, as they'll feel it's a defect or a poor-quality transfer. But it's not. It's great because they have recreated the way the film looked when it was presented theatrically. There is something particular to the film stock used in the 1980s that gave a lot of films a certain look and feel. That is maintained here, and it is the way the filmmakers wanted it to look at the time of its creation. Remastering is one thing, but &#34;recreating&#34; is another thing entirely.<br /><br />Also, the sound, while not 100% awesome, is quite good. In particular, for the first time I was able to clearly and powerfully hear the dog/demon in the refrigerator say &#34;Zuul.&#34; I've seen the movie a dozen times and it never resonated as clearly.<br /><br />I can't speak about the Ultra Violet digital version that usually comes with this disc. I bought a pre-owned copy form Amazon Warehouse and the digital copy had already been downloaded (as I expected).
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I am not a reader of zombie fiction. Despite loving fantasy/ sci-fi from an early age and reading it I never really got the whole zombie craze. This was my first foray into the genre and I loved it!<br /><br />Reading as a historical account I absolutely loved the differing viewpoints that provided a rich and engaging world for the reader. As a history nut I loved that this is the route that the author chose to take rather than a 'live action' version. This multi-person viewpoint style provided the audience with not just one hero but several and a lot of sympathetic not so good guys!!!!<br /><br />I didn't find the information over the top or too in-depth rather I found myself gradually taking on the points being made while enjoying the fantastic writing painting such vivid landscapes. From soldiers to policymakers, ordinary everyday folk to scientists at the heart of the outbreak I think that there is a voice for everyone in this novel which makes it soo accessible, even to those not too familiar with zombies!!<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
B00821OX98|4.0|only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the CGI isn't up to my high standards. I've heard it gets a lot better in the newer seasons. I think the show is great.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I have to say I was put onto this series because I was looking for a strong central female character and thankfully I was not disappointed. At first I did think that this was going to be another run of the mill post-apocalyptic novel with no major twists but I was most definitely surprised!<br /><br />The characters are all fascinating and the writing itself flows seamlessly between viewpoints. It actually took me back to a novel I read when I was at school - 'Z for Zacharia' which I loved. This novel is not my normal fare but I would highly recommend it to anyone!<br /><br />A fabulous read
0060594896|5.0|Truthfully, I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for the Success Principles. I was given the book as an award 6 years ago. I read it an applied as many principles I could. Because I took action, my life is much better. I have a better relationship with my family, I make more money, I have no debt and I have a much happier life! I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy today!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter asked me to try this. We both love horses so we have tried several games. This is by far the best one we've tried. Very happy with it. Thank you. Keep up the good work.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This story compels you to continue reading being drawn into the life of this woman.  It starts with a court transcript.  The story moves smoothly from 2003 to 2007.  It is one of those books that is hard to put down.  Enjoy

B00E8UKY3Q|2.0|The success of Peyo's late 1950s Belgian comic book strip, adopted in English as The Smurfs, spawned a successful 1980s animated series - a television show that ran for nearly ten years and is still broadcast as reruns today.  Due to the popularity of the animated series, which many consider to be one of the greatest animated shows of all-time, several movies, music albums, video games, and other countless forms of memorabilia were created, all eventually leading to the 2011 live action feature film.  While the film, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Hank Azaria, Jayma Mays, and Sofia Vergara, was utterly discouraging and painfully awful to sit through, the film still went on to gross more than $560 million.  Naturally, Sony Pictures Animation could not ignore the hefty payday, quickly giving the green light for a sequel, and setting a release date two years later.  Well, two years have passed, and the Smurfs are back in The Smurfs 2.<br /><br />Raja Gosnell (The Smurfs, Home Alone 3) returns to direct the sequel, which once again stars Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, and Jamya Mays as Grace.  Since the conclusion of the first film, Gargamel has been using his remaining power as a magic act - earning himself fame and fortune.  However, he still has it out for the Smurfs and concocts a plan to kidnap Smurfette (Katy Perry) on her birthday in hopes of extracting the formula from her to make his evil \\"naughties,\\" Vexy (Christina Ricci) and Hackus (J.B. Smoove), into Smurfs.  Naturally, this would allow Gargamel to create an army of his own Smurfs - of which he would then steal their essence and use the endless power to rule the world.  It's up to Papa Smurf (Jonathan Winters) and a handful of other Smurfs, along with the help of Patrick, Jamya, and Patrick's stepfather, Victor (Brendan Gleeson), to stop Gargamel before he is able to extract the formula.  The voices of Alan Cumming, Anton Yelchin, George Lopez, and Frank Welker also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />For those wondering if the sequel is just as painful to sit through as the original:  the answer is yes.  However, everyone needs to keep in mind that this film is not intended for the enjoyment of adults.  The film's target audience is kids between the ages of four and ten years old.  After ten years old, the odds of your children calling this film \\"lame\\" dramatically increases.  Still, the sequel does offer much more comedy than its predecessor, mainly from Hank Azaria's role as the eccentric wizard, Gargamel, and his evil cat, Azrael (voiced by Frank Welker).  Oddly enough, there's something funny about Gargamel getting hit by a bus and having a talking cat ask him if he's dead.  Regardless, their brief cracks and gags are isolated and scattered throughout the flick, adding a touch of enjoyment at timely moments, even though you'll have already lost all hope of enjoyment when they unexpectedly put a smile on your face.  Even though there are brief shades of light with the use of humor, this nearly hour and a half film will still conspicuously feel like three.<br /><br />Much like the first film, the sequel's cast is much too talented to be used in such a lackluster setting.  Both Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays, two intensely popular TV personalities, waste their craft on roles that relatively no one will appreciate.  The same can be said for the numerous voice actors used in the film, including Alan Cumming and Anton Yelchin.  And, for reasons beyond comprehension, the film uses several other high profile Hollywood personalities, such as Jeff Foxworthy, Mario Lopez, Jimmy Kimmel, and Shaquille O'Neal, in brief voice cameos as many of the Smurf voices.<br /><br />Speaking of voice roles, there's something immensely annoying about Katy Perry's role in the film.  It's not as though she does a poor job in the role as Smurfette per say, but this is just another occasion where one of the many voice actresses out there should have been cast in the role of Smurfette instead of a recording artist.  Not only do many of these \\"musicians\\" have to be successful at making their head-pounding drivel, but they also have to cross over into acting to steal a job that would have easily been better suited for someone with more experience...or talent.  Seriously, it's not as if a six year old is really going to care that Katy Perry is voicing one of the Smurfs.  Sadly, this is common practice for the majority of the animated features being released these days.<br /><br />Overall, it's hard to pick on a film that adults are not meant to enjoy.  The Smurfs are beloved childhood characters and to be honest, it's nice to see they're still popular today.  For many of us, The Smurfs were something we grew up watching, so there's something nostalgic about another generation also having the opportunity to enjoy these tiny, blue characters.  Most young children should get a kick out of this film, especially if the first film's DVD is sitting on your shelf and has gotten plenty of use.  No, this won't be an ideal trip to the movie theater for parents, and the overuse of the word \\"Smurf\\" will most likely annoy you, but the odds are you'll kids will appreciate that you sat through this generic family adventure.  Think of this film as being courteous enough to provide you with several opportunities to get popcorn refills.  In any event, it would appear The Smurfs are destined for another hefty payday with this sequel - and yet another sequel in the summer of 2015.<br /><br />On a side note, this was the final role for the late Jonathan Winters, who was the voice of Papa Smurf in both live action films, as well as Grandpa Smurf for three years of the animated series.  He was a beloved comedian that made millions laugh, and inspired the work of some of Hollywood's A-list comedians, including Robin Williams and Bill Cosby.<br /><br />GRADE:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comhe role of Smurfette instead of a recording artist.

B0049VZ222|5.0|The Walking Dead surprised me by focusing not only on the zombies, but the human survivors as well.  This show is amazing and so very addictive.  Hats off to AMC for producing such an incredible series.  Can't wait for Season 4!

B00445RHKI|5.0|In my opinion, Modern Family is one of the best written, acted and directed TV shows in a very long time.  It contains that rare combination of very smart, creative writers and talented actors (across the board) who mesh very well together.<br /><br />With a few rare exceptions, I enjoy almost every episode and laugh out loud quite often.  That is the sign of a great show.  Season 2 is fantastic.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Machine Gun preacher is a great eye opening movie. It's amazing how many people know nothing about the evil that takes place in parts africa (specifically Nigeria and Sudan). This movie shows how the lord can take a sinner and transform him into a servant that helps others and is willing to give up everthing in service.<br /><br />For those who judge fighting fire with fire to protect children, I would ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourself what you would do to protect your child. What have you done to help the children in Africa? This man sold his business and left his family to put himself in harms way for the sake of helping children everyone else seems to have forgot about.

Season 3 shows a few more weak areas.  The show, overall, is still highly entertaining, but I can tell things are not as \\"fresh\\" as before and they seem to be struggling to come up with new material.<br /><br />Season 3 is still very good, but Seasons 1 and 2 set a very high bar for TV comedy.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Such a great story! I couldn't put it down!! I doubt the movie will be as good at the book. It never is...
B0045XKJBI|4.0|I bought this move after reading this music guide (I had heard there was alot of good indie music in here).  [[ASIN:B00BWHJEQ6 Twilight: Eclipse Soundtrack List (Twilight Music Guide Books)]] I was surprised to find that the movie was actually good.  It had a decent plot and well-developed characters.  I don't know why everyone hates on these movies so much.  I'm going to watch the other ones now to get the rest of the story.

B00ADZCDKM|5.0|I didn't think I would like this as much I did. His vocals are original, though it's a cross between a little David Bowie and a lot Jim Carroll. He plays a terrific piano as well. As a song writer he is precise and profound. He is worth checking out. Try his EP first, and go from there.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for kids and adults who love funny and mischief in games like this and everyone I MEAN EVERYONE should download this hilarious game

0553804367|5.0|This book not only explains the physical realm (without formulas, but with plenty of theory), but it also gives a history of our understanding of the universe. Its a great primer for someone starting out in Phsyics and I recommend it to anyone who is intrested in science in general. The new reprint is easier to read than the original. The book is very small about 150 pages in all and it's an easy read with great illustrations for the major concepts. Read it with a friend. Or assign chapters to high school students.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Easily one of the nicest looking games I have played. Game play is fantastic. This game keeps me busy for hours.

1594746036|2.0|***Warning: probable spoilers ahead***<br /><br />This book was a huge \\"almost\\" for me. The first half was really interesting and different, plot-wise, and it was a lot of what I expected, given the title, cover art, description, etc. But once we switched to the actual \\"home\\" for the \\"peculiar children,\\" the book went downhill fast. From that moment on, it became ridiculously cliché and stereotypical. I hope I'm not too negative in this review, but it's what stood out to me as I read it.<br /><br />The prologue was really interesting and from the tone and inferences, I expected it to be a creepy/supernatural-type of book. However, once the actual story got going, I remember consciously thinking \\"Oh...THAT'S the secret?\\" Huge disappointment.<br /><br />I was also irritated to find out that Jacob was really snarky and had a pretty bad attitude in general (he actually tries to get fired from his family business job by being a huge pill at work). I wasn't a bit surprised to find out that he didn't have any friends; as other reviewers have said, he made himself so unpleasant, I don't know who would want to be around him. I also felt like every few pages the author tried as hard as he could to use the word \\"shit\\" and its derivatives as many times as possible in a given paragraph or page. I'm not a prude when it comes to swearing; I actually think it can add just the right amount of \\"umph\\" when tastefully executed, but that was the problem here: it wasn't tastefully done at all. Even my friends who did swear more than others at age 16 didn't swear like Sailor Jacob. There also seemed to be an abnormally high number of sexual references for a juvenile novel. I wouldn't want my kids reading and learning some of the phrases that Jacob throws around.<br /><br />The pictures, on the other hand, were really cool and the switch from text to picture worked well in the first half when the mystery was still...well, a mystery. Also, as I said before, the story is actually intriguinguntil Jacob arrives on the other side of the \\"time loop\\" and starts spending time at the peculiar home. I was very much reminded of the \\"Charlie Bone\\" books from this point on. The author tried to create too many characters and the end result was that they are shallow and one-sided. They are actually more no-sided, really, because I honestly could not tell one child from another and by the time they were all working together as a group in the last 40 pages or so, I was no longer interested in what happened to any of them. There was no point to creating so many kids in the group because they were completely indistinguishable from each other. I couldn't even remember which power went with which name, much less what their supposed personalities were. I think if the author had picked two or three of the children and really tried to bring out their voices, it would have been much more effective.<br /><br />That said, Jacob and Emma were the most interesting characters in this little \\"almost\\" novel, despite my personal aversion to Jacob's attitude and personality. They were at least some of the few characters with more than one dimension to them. I do have to admit, though, that the romance aspect didn't work for me. Emma starts out nearly sticking Jacob through with a knife and has spent decades missing and loving Jacob's grandfather, and then within 24 hours, they are friends and love interests? Come on, don't insult me as a reader.<br /><br />The plot itself also seemed to be almost ad-libbed in the second half, as if the author said to himself \\"Ok, I've got this all set up....but where is it going to go...? Oh what the heck...time travel!\\"<br /><br />A few little things: the monster was defeated WAY too easily (another \\"Oh....that's it?\\" moment); the fact that the grandfather's feared \\"monsters\\" turned out to be real monsters was lame and made me wonder why WWII was a necessary plot device at all; I don't remember learning why the people at the peculiar home don't start every day over with no memory of the previous day like their fellow villagers do; in the second half, the pictures felt superfluous.<br /><br />This book's biggest vice? It's a first-of-a-series book. This is totally subjective and personal, but aren't all reviews? I really have a distaste for fantasy book series these days. I feel that many authors drag on plots and weak characters in order to produce 4, 5, or 6 books that will sell. I was honestly willing to swallow everything Ransom Riggs was feeding me as a reader until I realized that the book wasn't going to be resolved in any fewer than 2 sequels. That was the moment when the entire book felt cheap to me and the second half of the book suddenly felt cliché.<br /><br />However, there are two things that I think contributed to my unfortunate reading experience. First, I am probably not the target audience. I'm a 22-year-old college student (and an English major to boot), not a junior high schooler, and I think this book may have been geared toward that age group. So if you're over 20, I'd look for a great standalone book and pass this one over. Or at the very least, get it from the library.<br /><br />The second, I personally think this book was mis-advertised. All the descriptions I read from publishers made it sound on the gothic and creepy side, not another series with kids with special powers who will end up saving the world for ignorant non-magical/non-peculiar/non-endowed/non-whateveryourparticularseriescallsit humans. That is ultimately what left me with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. If the book had been properly represented, I wouldn't have read it.

145211207X|5.0|With each Disney/Pixar movie that has come out, I have purchased the &#34;Art of&#34; book because I enjoy looking at the creative ideas that go into making one of these fantastic films.<br /><br />From storyboards, to concept sketches, to nearly final digital renderings, each book shows all the main characters as well as some of the minor ones. We also get to look at all the background scenes where the characters are, be it a college full of monsters or a small town inhabited by automobiles.<br /><br />And this &#34;Art of&#34; book is no different. I really loved looking at each page and reading the animator's thoughts about each character. Especially how they drew inspiration from the stars who voiced each character. My favorite in this book is the evolution of Dean Hardscrabble.<br /><br />If you are a fan of animation and the creative process, then this book is for you.

B00D97QU3C|4.0|This 1980s Heavy Metal band from Long Island, New York, Twisted Sister, featured lead vocalist Dee Snider, guitarists Jay Jay French and Eddie \\"Fingers\\" Ojeda, bassist Mark \\"The Animal\\" Mendosa, and drummer A.J. Pero. Each also provided backing vocals. In 1987, Pero was replaced by Joey Franco, the same year the band dissolved.<br /><br />Stay Hungry (Atlantic A1 80156) was their third album. Released on May 10, 1984, it produced two of their three hit singles, We're Not Gonna Take It, a # 21 Billboards Pop Hot 100 in August 1984 on Atlantic 89641 b/w You Can't Stop Rock `N' Roll, and the # 68 Hot 100 I Wanna Rock in October on Atlantic 89617 b/w The Kids Are Back. Neither B-side was in the album.<br /><br />Their only other hit single came in December 1985 when Leader Of The Pack finished at # 53 Hot 100 on Atlantic 89478 b/w a re-release of I Wanna Rock. The album, however, with some three million copies sold, earned multiple-platinum awards. It was also in 1985 that they made a cameo in the movie Pee Wee's Big Adventure performing Burn In Hell. In 2004 they re-grouped to re-record the tracks from this album and it was released in October by Spitfire, with bonus tracks, as Still Hungry (available at Amazon).<br /><br />Five years later, to mark the 25th Anniversary of Stay Hungry, Rhino released a 2-CD set (also available at Amazon) with the first disc containing remasters of the original cuts, while the second disc gives you 15 previously unreleased tracks containing alternate versions of the originals along with a new selection specifically recorded for this release. An additional bonus for both fans and those independent record stores that the band held in high esteem was a DVD showing their 1984 Stay Hungry Live concert, originally broadcast on MTV and previously unavailable on DVD. The only thing was, that was made available for one day only - June 30, 2009 - and only through remaining independent record shops.

Yes, the film takes a lot of Hollywood screen story telling in order to produce a viable, and I might add entertaining story line.  I think that this film is about the human side of this time period, whether historically correct or not.  In order to make this historical event entertaing, this liberty is granted.  I have studied the written history of the Northeast durin this period and I might add that it seems to be a very dry gathering and presentation of facts.  I could still verily identify with this film, as I'm sure many of you will.  A STORNG HUMAN FORCE CAN BE BOTH GOOD AND BAD!  NJMJr!

193700788X|1.0|12 reads straight, yes the last 2 were not as good as the book showdown of Bad Witches on 'V'. Which was great and better than Ball's goofed up version, which was like supernanny meets medium meets True Blood. The character they burnt was foxy and had the feeling of power not Marnie. The Russell Edginton Debacle is a 1 book read with a bloody get together of the Mississippi Vamps outnumbering the Viking, Sookie, and Bill taking on the whole Miss. Vamp squad. The show and the books are so much different and while I have like aspects of the show the books were always better at portraying the inner monologue of Sam, Bill, Eric, and Alcide. The casting was decent and it started well, but if you had read the books you know Edgington's true Story, and Eric Northman the would be king who is constantly in command in any situation, turns into a whining brooding, sour character that is honestly painful to see. Do you see a guy named Felipe Del Castro taking on the 1'000 year old viking with Pam, Bill, Sookie, Mustapha, Alcide and other Supes at his back. Even the Amnesiac Northman would have hung him from the world tree and stuck a spear in his side to praise Odin. This book had a distinctive line in which Sookie is making a DiGoirmo's pizza and actually whoever wrote this wrote , about the boxes, \\"you know how darn difficult they are to get in the trash bag. I'm thinking that whoever wrote this made a Pizza previous to that line because it is not relevant and mundane as can be. So we have sobbing Northman a King in his world unbeatable giving up, as does the entire cast. The third person angle referred to in many of these posts is very disturbing because no one cares, You do not change to 3rd person story telling on the final and 13 book. Eric's maker on the show was better but the books were fantastic I read 2 in 2 days once I was hooked and this sad excuse for a conclusion is terrible for characters we have all come to care for, the fates of the characters played out and one man suggested in an earlier review that he though a ghost writer may have been involved I agree and it was likely a first time writer because this book does not belong in this epic mythology. If Charlaine Harris wrote it she was either pissed at HBO for completely changing the story after book 3, some was an improvement Mrs Harris and I would have rather seen Bon Tomps, LA burned to the ground in an epic battle that this sad sappy pile of crap. If you wrote this yourself you intentionally went out on the lowest possible note. Northman , Sookie, and the crew have handled dangers far worse this is a mopy sob fest. It should be titled Everyone gives up and lead mediocre lives, and don't fight for their passions anymore. A Sookie Stackhouse southern Vampire $%^& sandwich is what dedicated readers dot, I sincerely hope this was not your work your trusted an Arrow through the whole series with this last book while I highly recommend the first 12. This was an entire mythology swept off the porch and every character goes totally against their nature's established in the previous 12 books (still highly recommended) by me this last one should be good to build forts for kids and will be in he Bargain Bin Section. Loose ends fly like ribbons in this trail of idiocy every established plot was demolished, every player gives up, and so, so many loose ends one could braid the strands and it would stretch miles. Sad really. Laurrell K. Hamilton wrote a great series too then it was all about sex and little story, that why the first 8 or so books were popular to both genders but I have never seen a male pick up Narcissus in Chains, or Incubus Dreams, another great supernatural tale that ran strong through 7-8 books then just became smut. It was great as were the first 12 books you wrote in this seines sadly it ended as a boring book that most give 1 star to. I loved the books until this one Mediocre chores detailed greatly everything about the mythos reversed of burned in effigy, Iam sorry to say this if you are ailing or indoor health but the legends you created deserved fates far better a war, an ace up the sleeve. No just p*ss poor writing from a legend. It saddened me to read this when I read through the others like tomorrow may not get here so I better read them all and to end like this is a travesty.

B008ER9QKG|3.0|Where to start? I saw all four of these at the cinema, dragging some classical music-inclined friends of mine each time, and each time, at least one of those friends was asleep by the second act. It's not Wagner's fault (totally)--it's the Machine. It physically prevents people from coming close to one another, so singers are, more often than not, left staring out into empty space. This kills the drama. Added to this problem is that some cast members can sing, but not act (Blythe, Kaufmann) and some can act, but not sing (Terfel, Voigt). This is a shame, because I'm a huge fan of Blythe and Terfel ordinarily, but Blythe didn't have much to work with (she got rolled on and off stage in Walkure, which is practical given the set but not very exciting) and Terfel's voice, while solid, is not a \\"true\\" bass voice--I found myself wishing that Alberich (Eric Owens) was singing his part instead.<br /><br />Things do improve with \\"Siegfried.\\" Jay Hunter Morris is quite a find: a kindly tenor who isn't afraid of the part and approaches it with gusto and sympathy. His voice can go thin on the high notes, but I can't name a Siegfried in the last twenty years where that isn't the case. He's an up-and-comer, as is, I think, Eva-Maria Westbroek, the Dutch soprano. \\"Die Walkure\\" was taped when she was ill, but her peculiar charisma and ringing high notes got my attention regardless. Unlike Voigt, she's not a shrieker, and like Morris, she seems to like her part.<br /><br />All this is just to say that the casting is uneven and disappointing, as is the acting, though the latter is vastly improved over the Met's previous set from the '90s. The staging is also uneven--there are some highly effective images (sadly, the burning of Valhalla isn't a standout), but there's also a ton of upstaging kitsch. It seems like every time a character is about to reveal something important or discover something important about themselves, the stage moves. It's distracting, irritating, and LOUD. Not ideal for opera.<br /><br />Other musical values (the orchestra and conductors, particularly Fabio Luisi!) are outstanding. The Met orchestra is world-class and Luisi brings a freshness to the score that is sorely missing from the Met's earlier set. He lets the music be heavy when it needs to, but the energy he pulls out of the music is very fun. If this set were released CD-only, I might recommend it based on Luisi's contribution, particularly the \\"Siegfried.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, this is probably the most solid traditional DVD production of the Ring that's available through normal channels, and it's not terribly good. It's not horrible, either, but my advice is to stick with the Boulez/Chereau set (an oldie but a goodie) or, if you must have your Wagner slow, Barenboim's Bayreuth set. This one's lackluster all around, so unless you really love one of the performers or are some kind of a completist collector, I'd say give this a pass.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I like novels that are set in dystopian worlds and this one definitely qualifies. The whole Wiggin family, especially Ender, are very engaging characters. Card does a great job of presenting morally ambiguous situations without being preachy, so the reader can think on their own without being fed to much of a &#34;line&#34;.<br /><br />Ender's Game is great reading for people who enjoy SciFi, the military, childhood (not tween!!) angst or loved The Hunger Games.  My only compliant about this book was I always want to know more about the world Ender lives in-- why did it end up this way, what is the backstory, how did decision-making get put into military hands? Similar to the dystopian worlds created by Margaret Atwood in the Handmaid's Tale, you never really get to know, you can only imagine. Both ways have their merits  I suppose.<br /><br />I'm currently on the 3rd book in this series, and I have to say they keep getting better. Give it a try!

I wasn't crazy about Perfect Symmetry and honestly I like their live stuff best as I got a copy of a live recording from Hull on Tom's return from rehab and that is just a wonderful recording that contains about 20 songs.<br /><br />But Strangeland seems deeply personal and the lyrics appear to have deep meaning even if that meaning may be somewhat hidden. And Tom just milks the words as on \\"Sea Fog\\". The guy has such great voice and this really stands out on \\"You Are Young\\", \\"Watch How You Go\\" and especially \\"Neon River\\" which is my favorite track on the album. Tim does his usual brilliant job on the keys, so creative and thoughtful in his playing. I hear little stabs that just speak to me. The other tunes are all quite serviceable even if some don't stand out on first listen. This is one of those discs that just stays in my changer. Someday it will come out but no time soon.<br /><br />Have not heard the bonus tracks in their entirety and it is interesting that the title track is one of them but I like the way this disc was laid out regardless. Clearly some thought went into this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game challenges you but is stimulating. I have found fun to figure out. Can't wait to get the updated version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Quick to learn and great fun! lots of challenges to achieve and the coins keep racking up.  Different runs each time using similiar elements. We love it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the more better solitaire apps out there for the Android platform.  You can play solitaire.  That's what it does.

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|&#34;Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do me a service in return. Until that day, consider this justice a gift from my wife, your daughter’s godmother.&#34;  Great story!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I love the weather. I watch it all the time. Now it's on my kindle too. I can get the Afghanistan weather where my son's at also.
B007K7K3TO|5.0|If you love Iron Maiden then this is a pretty good CD.  It is from their Final Frontier Tour so there are some of their more newer songs.  It still rocks, though!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Fast paced action. Always a treat to read Baldacci! Just when you think you have it figured out here comes the twist!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I watched this.  I enjoyed it.  That really shouldn't have much impact on your impressions, but if you're on the fence, I say check it out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Duh get to continue reading while at work all the books I can't put down.  I like the new enhancements
B005LAII4E|4.0|Critics fail again. This was actually a pretty good movie. Remember, it's a GI Joe film, it's not supposed to be realistic. For starters, the film is just more of a professional product. The rampant use of CGI was tossed, and as a result the action scenes have been vastly improved. Marlon Wayans is also gone, which is a huge plus for the tone of the film. It's just a far better movie than the first one. It definitely is worthy of the title GI Joe. I realize that because of bad critic reviews and wannabe film critics, a lot of people won't give this a chance. Just watch it and trust me, it was very good. I enjoyed the film and the writing very much. If you come into this film expecting the next Private Ryan or Batman, then perhaps you need to start learning how to enjoy movies again.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|If you are a geek like me that enjoys tromping the computer with your vast knowledge of rogue chess moves then you will enjoy this free game.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|This movie was decent but by no means exceptional. The plot was run of the mill, no twists or surprises. The highlight was admiring D.Johnson's phenomenal body. Aside from that, the plot was really unrealistic. There was more of a plot in \\"Tooth Fairy.\\"
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Its fun but I wish you did not have to start over at the beginning when you run out of time .Fix it so you start at last level completed ,you would get five starts out of me then.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Packed with plenty of plot twist and definitely an enjoyable read. I'd read it again if offered the option to read it again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather channel is my go to site for home, family and travel weather. I love how precise and accurate it is. The app is a great extension of that and I never have any problems.
0316153826|4.0|enjoyed reading it. i can say buy it youll like it too. it make a good read and it good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game didn't make sense at fort but then I continued to play and it turned out to be so much fun!!!!
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Great movie! My only complaint is that the Wicked Witch is too \\"pretty\\". It was obvious you were looking at M.K.
B00006I53S|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this lens. It's a great all-around zoom. I've taken it on vacation and didn't regret leaving the other lenses I have at home. Even in a professional setting doing portraiture I find myself leaning on this workhorse. Highly recommended.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was captivated by the characters in this story.  The resolution of the mystery took me by surprise. Nicely woven tapestry of past and present.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|This game takes up way to much space I tried deleting all my games for it and it still didn't work
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It was ok.  I've seen better, I've seen worse.  It was fairly predictable though, but again, not really a surprise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I will never stop playing. If did not get this game I would just die.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This was a good movie according to my husband.  I didn't watch it, I fell asleep.  I was bored, so I can't really judge it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love it but I'm very upset that your killing off Mathew. He a vital character for the Abby. I'm looking forward to seeing how the new farming method works for the Abby. Love to see how they lived back then.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Good story line, a little sappy, but over all a must see and you will get points with da wife....
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. But survival craft is Way better then this. I recommend this app, but I recommend survivel craft way more then I do to this app.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Very good movie, and some good acting, a must see, Arnold still has it. good plot, good action, great movie.
140006922X|1.0|If the author would debate a reputable historian on his subject matter, his theories would go up in flames.  The facts do not support his opinions any more than they support Dan Brown's fictional writings.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|better then skinning the cat, ok over all, a little slow in some spots, but still should watch it on Netflix.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I've never left a review before but felt this deserved one. It is so well written and moves along quickly. Yes, the topics are difficult and disbursing but she handles them well. The climax completely undid me, which is what a great novel can do. Such talent! Not the book for a light easy read but one with guts. I applaud Rowling for stepping so faraway from Harry (even though I adored them). Bravo!
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Worth seeing but it was nothing great, bruce is always good, the rock to. Glad I did not pay to see in theater
B007MDB71O|5.0|Excellent Movie! I keep hearing about how it didn't gross a great deal of money while in the theaters, however I'll place blame where blame is due which is on the advertisement. Disney did a horrible job advertising this movie. The trailers that were released gave absolutely no hint to the actual storyline, which in my opinion was the movie's biggest issue. However, this movies has one of the freshest plots ever developed and is loaded with cool action sequences and great characters. A must see unless you are the type to find fault in travel to Mars because it's not very realistic. Yeah Right! Grab your popcorn, sit down, and enjoy one of the best movies of all times.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have enjoyed the last 3 books, I think the only  3 books, by Khaled Hosseini!  There are all very interesting and have a great story line.  He writes a beautiful book.  Learned a lot about places and people I knew very little or nothing about.  This third one is my favorite so far; hope he keeps writing!!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Nice to have a game that makes you stop and think.  It's a pleasant change from all of the timed twitch-fests out there.  I play games to relax, not to compete against a timer or a scoreboard.  It's also nice not to HAVE to rush-rush-rush then wait 1-48 hours like all of those bakery/farm/restaurant/zoo simulators.<br /><br />The 44 levels in this game went faster than I expected, so here's to hoping that any app updates will include extra levels.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this to app it keeps me from pulling hair out when I'm waiting for my son to get out of practice.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I had loaded a few flashlight apps to my Kindle fire, I like this one the best so far because you can choose what color you want it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I got suspicious at the end of Part 1 - Skipped to the last 10 pages -<br />Didn't bother with the rest. Grateful for my library & e-book lending. Might have felt obligated to read the whole thing if money had been spent.
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I really like this bike mirror.  It is so much better than others I have owned.  Small, but offers a good view of the road behind you.  Easy to attach to bike.  And most importantly, doesn't require constant repositioning every time you hit a bump!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because it is made of several different games. I play it a lot on long road trips.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This is a very well done movie.  I wish more movies like this were being made today.  Great story, great acting, well done costumes and sets.  This is what movie making should be all about.  There are no zombies, no special effects, no noise.  It's a well done drama about Mary Surratt, her atty, and a military tribunal.  I get Sec. Stanton's point of view.  Put yourself in his position in 1865.  However, it is very possible that a woman (Mary Surratt, the conspirator) was put to death w/o evidence.  I do not know enough about all of the factual matter which led to her death.  Wright did a great job (very believable) of portraying Mary Surratt and her reluctant atty (McAvoy) was also outstanding.  Congratulations to everyone who was involved in making this movie.  Good work.
0385537670|1.0|Oh, if only we were allowed to rate a book with zero stars or even a minus star.  Wow.  I forced myself (no pun intended) to finish this book because I kept wondering what all the fuss was about.  I certainly will NOT be reading books 2 and 3.  The writing was beyond atrocious, formulaic and pathetic, really.  There was no story line at all: they met, they had sex, she went on holiday, more sex, she leaves.  End of story.<br />I shudder to think that this is a best seller.  What happened to critical thinking - did people really enjoy this or were they just jumping on the bandwagon?
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This games is hands Down the best slenderman game I've played. Can't wait for chapter 2 to come out. Yeah!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I started this game I was already having fun and my son was already having fun to.<br />Just super fun.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Better than any of the original Planet of the Apes movies. Has more heart and deeper relationships. &#34;Malfoy&#34; gets his just dues (and proves he has a bit of range). Not really a sequel---maybe a &#34;reimagining&#34; of Conquest from the original series.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Finally I can plug it in where its easy access to use, while still needing to charge it. The short able it comes with, they forget to mention it doesn't charge very fast. Started trying to charge my Kindle the first time OEM cable took forever! I went back to Amazon and had to purchase the  Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging. More money again. But now, with both of these together, it charges quickly!
0811870413|5.0|The author is extremely knowledgeable. This is the guy who taught Michael Pollan how to bake bread when he researched his book &#34;Cooked&#34;. I had to read the basic bread recipe (very long and involved) numerous times to get myself ready to bake, but my first loaf was a winner. I've lent out the book to a friend, so I haven't been able to push beyond the basics. But making bread that is leavened with the wild yeasts in my kitchen and on my hands is most gratifying.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Beautifully written, honest, and extensive biography of Jobs. How he interacted with all the prominent tech people in the late 2000's is quite illuminating. He was a brilliant and undesireable character. I strongly recommend this book
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season really tests your limits on how far you will root for your protagonist.  Dexter's choices start to take a toll on those around him.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for the next book. I love the way Gideon protects his love. I like to find out who is protecting Gideon...I don't want to spoil it for others, but whoever read this book would know what I am talking about. Great book. Thank you Sylvia Day.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful story!  Highly recommend!  Could not put it down.  Really made me think and gave me a new perspective! Live, Love, and Laugh often!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|i cant wait to read the next one!!! i love the mortal instruments series so much!!! Cassandra Clare is AMAZING!!!!! this book left me with many jaw drops and laughs and tears. 5/5 stars. i definitely recommend this book!!!
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|This app is pretty good. Directions are reasonably accurate. There are not a lot of people in my area using it yet so I don't get many reports and it seems a little girly that is why only 4 stars. Overall I would recommend it.
0062020897|3.0|I  like KEN FOLLETT,S BOOKS,but wasn,t crazy over this one.  It just didn,t grab my attention.His other books are much better.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book is pure blasphemy. It is written by a man who has lied about both his education and his job. He does not have ANY kind of history degree...let alone a degree in religious history. His PhD is in Sociology.<br /><br />The author has an extreme anti-Christian bias and his work is anything but scholarly. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play can be a challenge. Hope there is more levels soon. Is a very addicting game to play.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This is definitely a classic movie.  One of my favorites to watch any time.  You're gonna need a bigger boat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little Niece just loves to play  this game and loves taking care of her new pet Beauty. It's wonderful
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Same as installer, brilliant app instal this app and another and you have a flash player for kindle fire hd
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Definitely great for the kids. Cute dragons, and bright and colorful.  A few to many graphics for adults in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing! cant believe its free. no glitches; just fun!!! I totally recommend this to everyone. have fun!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like this app very nice. It gets your brain thinking while having that fun factor also. I would recommend this app to my friends.
B002OMZTSK|4.0|Would reccomend. Enjoyed the book. would like to read more from this author. Story keep me interested in reading it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't know how they are going to make a movie about it with only a R rating.  The storyline is easy to follow and there are not so many characters to keep track of.  Entertaining, yet a bit monotonous with the provocative scenes  I will be reading the second one.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I was hooked the very first word Rick Riordan is amazing I could not put down the book when I had to got to bed.  I was not disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy bingo and so did enjoy playing.  However, I found myself shut out of some places in the midst of a game...don't know why.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|The stop-motion is great, and these have wonderful humor for both children and adults. I actually enjoy watching it with the kiddo, which I definitely cannot say for most kids shows.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I found this game difficult...but that is just my problem.  This just isn't my kind of entertainment.  However, I did enjoy playing it wiih my grandson.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was not the same as his other books (that I love so much), but it was still, in my opinion, a great read. Not only does he captivate you with the first few pages of the book, but he holds you in by constantly expecting those first characters to be re-introduced. Instead of taking you on a journey through a set of main characters, Khaled introduces several characters through the course of the book, and never links everyone as you assume he might in the end. Khaled' s style of writing is so enjoyable and detailed that it takes you to a place - whatever place the characters are - and you become so involved in it that you forget the other characters of other chapters! I recommend this book as I do with his other two, and anticipate his next!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It's my favorite at present.  It is really enjoyable and easy to play.  I don't quite understand the scoring or the graphics...may be just my problelm.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am mainly a movie goer instead of reading books.  I can honestly say I am under qualified to leave a review but to me, this book was amazing.  I decided to purchase and read Enders Game when I saw the preview in the Movie Theater.  I purchased the book on Monday and finished it on Thursday.  I could not put the book down as I actually felt I was right next to Ender during his experiences.  I am really excited to see the movie in November.<br />As an individual who normally does not read books, I already started on Book #2 and will continue to read the who series.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I like it alot.  Would enjoy some himts occasionally.  On  some of the floors I was suspended for days because I couldn't find my way out.
159562015X|5.0|Why didn't anyone tell me I have to buy a new one in order to use the key code for my assignment! The author only lets the key code get used once, so I was unable to complete my course assignment! Here is a tip, buy it new IF YOU NEED IT FOR THAT UOP course! Shame on the author for not allowing it to be used again...this is supposed to be a &#34;self-introspection&#34; help book and half of the battle for self-introspection is buying the book to move forward and improve! There ought to be some benefit to that!
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Great movie with a LOT OF ACTION and great car. I've watched it several times and still love the action!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|great game it is like<br /><br />minecraft but more mobs and animals. Only downside is there is no multi player.<br />Sometimes world's that people make having inappropriate names, but just ignore it.
B008C20TDG|5.0|the section on hormones is great.. I've read a lot of paleo books, you can get a bunch of science here, but you can also just read it for good info without getting to technical.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Friends were talking about this author's new book and I had not heard of him.  They said go ahead and get Ocean to start.  I am so glad I did!  I loved the story and the writing.  I will definitely be reading more of his books.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of &#34;2nd-of-3&#34; books, but this was incredible. I am captivated by Larsson's complex character development.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I absolutely love the TV series so I thought I would give the books a try.  I am so glad I did!  As good as the show is, the books are even better!  More complex, more developed, not needing to wrap up in an hour.  I just need to wait to read more until the show is done for the season...a few changes too confusing to do both at the same time.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Lots of insights into the food business.  I could hardly put it down.<br />If youj like food you will enjoy this book.
B005L38QK2|2.0|As a female gamer, I found the mouse to be large and cumbersome. Although it says compatible with Mac I did have some issue with the right side buttons, but I was also using it for WoW not Diablo3 which could be part of the problem. I just went back to my regular mouse that is smaller and more comfortable. Wish I saved the packaging so I could of returned it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I really liked this game. Yes, it can be difficult, but it is beautifully done and stays interesting. I really enjoyed it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|They have not made movies like this since the 90's, it was so good it was almost bad and just the right kind of cheesy - a perfect couch-bound evening awaits you!<br /><br />PS Using cinematography and live actors instead of CGI to create dramatic effects?  Yes, please.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|We enjoyed this movie in the theater and now can enjoy it at home.  Lots of fun and great entertainment.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|R.I.P. Andy Whitfield- the best Spartacus ever!!! I have seen the season many times and just love it. No regrets.
B0090SI582|3.0|As it turned out, The Wolverine was much better than I expected it to be, and I actually enjoyed most of it. It has its issues, but, at least, they weren't really bad story-telling issues. The story, amazingly enough, was pretty solid and managed to not go off the cliff that the origin movie did. Of course, the story is only \\"pretty solid\\" if you look at it within the context of the X-Men movies. This movie has nothing to do with the comics other than that they pull some familiar characters from the Wolverine mythos to use in the movie. If you were hoping for anything resembling an adaptation of the Frank Miller/Chris Claremont Wolverine mini-series from the early '80s, you're not going to find that here. Okay, you'll get something vaguely resembling it. Very vaguely. He does fight some Hand ninjas. Except their not called that. So we're back to that \\"vaguely\\" again.<br /><br />The thing to know about The Wolverine is that it's not about what it's about it. Within the context of the X-Men movies, the story is here to bridge the gap between X-Men: The Last Stand and the forthcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past and deal with the ramifications of how Last Stand ended. Basically, it's to get Logan to let go of the death of Jean and his part in it. With that goal in mind, The Wolverine actually accomplished its purpose and in a way that made sense. The micro-plot of just this one movie wasn't too bad either, even if it did have more than its share of \\"what the heck?\\" moments.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />The biggest issue with the movie is the sleight-of-hand they play with Logan's healing power. The dying old guy wants Logan's ability, and the best the writers could come up with is that the old dude is going to \\"steal\\" it. Not duplicate it, steal it. Which sounds like they're going to do some kind of thing like when Rogue absorbs other mutants' powers, but, no, the old guy is just going to drill into Logan's bone marrow and transfer the power to himself, which doesn't make any sense, but I'll give it a pass on the handwavium principle. Except that they also \\"suppress\\" his healing power using a little \\"Matrix\\" bug that gets on Wolvie's heart, and they don't explain that, either, especially after making it seem as if this is some other mutant thing before we find out it's a device. Really, you can only get a pass on one of these things in the movie. The deal with the tiny robot is that they want Wolverine to rip his own heart out to get rid of the thing, so I can see that they're going for the \\"cool factor\\" with that, but, then, they don't show it, so they lose out on that, anyway. And it leaves all kinds of questions: does the little robot bug suppress all mutant abilities or just Logan's? Or just Logan's healing factor? It's hard to tell, because he really doesn't use any of his heightened senses in the movie at all, so we don't know if he still has those or not. Of course, there's also the argument that Logan's healing power should have just expelled the little robot bug to begin with, but the movie Wolverine isn't quite as powerful as the comic book Wolverine.<br /><br />And neither is adamantium, evidently, because we again have a \\"bullet piercing adamantium\\" situation in that the old guy cuts off Wolverine's claws to get at his bone marrow. It's slightly more believable than the bullet being fired into Logan's head but not by much.<br /><br />At any rate, those things are just issues with story points not the story itself, and we have to deal with those all the time. Like people surviving explosions by jumping into water or standing behind a wall or whatever. So, whereas there are some... stupid? silly? okay, stupid... things within the story, the plot of The Wolverine holds up both on the level of there being a villain intent upon stealing Logan's healing powers and as a vehicle for Logan to get over have killed Jean.<br /><br />Having said all of that, The Wolverine is not a movie you have to see in the theater. It's not like Pacific Rim or Man of Steel (although I think it's a better movie than both of those) that really need to be seen on the big screen to get the full effect of the scope of the action. You can just as easily wait for the DVD for this one, and, honestly, I doubt there's anything necessary in this movie for the overall X-Men story line. If you like Wolverine, it's probably worth seeing it, but you're not going to feel like you missed anything if you give this one a pass on the way to Days of Future Past.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I'm sorry but this game is great.  I am confounded by anyone who gives it low ratings.  Thanks to the dev , please add more levels.  I will look into your apps from here on. :-)
B008RTE066|1.0|do not like it, almost any song. Do not buy it. Beatles have bettter products, do not waste your money.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|If you really want to appreciate this movie, you need to watch the firefly series as well.  Most of the cast is in Buffy the Vampire at one point or another.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Its been a long time since Joe madee a good CD, this is a good CD, kinda brings back the good old days.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love it. Get it it is worth it. It was fun and entertaining for the whole family. Must have game fun twists.
B000002UAO|5.0|How can you not admire the Beatles, I had them all but lost this one, so my collection is back.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|If there was an option for a minus star then that's what I would give this book.  It doesn't even deserve a half a star.  We chose this book at book club because of the big hype around it as to what a fantastic thriller it was.  Whoever decided that this book was a thriller needs to look up the definition of thriller.  I was utterly disappointed. As were the rest of book club.  What a load of tripe.  This book doesn't deserve to be published!  The editor and publisher need to find a different occupation because they clearly don't know a good book from a bad one!!!
B003UYUP58|4.0|Good summary of history of cancer - yes it's older than the world's oldest profession.  Not easy to fix but we've come a long, long way in our remedies.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|For the most part, its an interesting story of one woman's odyssey through the American legal system. Though without giving away any spoilers its CLEARLY evident why the folks at Netflix felt the need to embellish this novel so heavily for their television series based on this book. (And i do mean VERY HEAVILY) In fact, the only connection to this book and the series is Piper herself. However, be advised that in comparison to other authors penned prison experiences OITNB is a sugar-coated, Gilmore Girls type lament ranging from federally imposed mandatory minimum sentencing to cellblock microwave recipes. This book will no doubt be at the top of many book club lists and a favorite of country club, elitist and academic activists everywhere.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Works well. Holds my big 6-cell in place. Have removed and replaced light many times with no problems. I have read that some have experienced cracking and breaking, I would suggest that you pull it straight out and put it back in straight. I think maybe problems happen when you don't. I like it, good job.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like it a lot. The music and sound effects are great.  Wonderful graphics and is was FREE. Way to go gameloft.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not being one for English history, I have shocked myself by becoming addicted to this series.  The costumes, characters and story have proved irresistible  and I have become a fan.  The third season was especially engaging and the story quite shocking.  I highly recommend it...give it a chance.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie, there is no doubt about that.  However, Amazon needs to work on their streaming video, it kept pausing and it would take a few minutes each time to restart.  Very Annoying!
B007WFR0QS|1.0|only liked one song on the cd.  songs boring and bland . did a good deed and passed it forward to local goodwill
B008M721MS|5.0|Only option on Fire HD.. very nice.. picture quality not  awesome... but has been quiet responsive to use.<br />* *
B00DU73T08|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie.  The whole time while reading the book, I kept thinking they should make a movie about it.  I wanted to see how the characters would be portrayed, what they would look like, and mostly what the cave would look like.  I found the movie very true to the book, which I sometimes like and hope for, but got some great imagery now to go with my memories of the book.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Good:<br />I use it primarily for side loading android apps.<br />So for side loading, its an excellent app. . .

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Before the Chromecast was announced, I was thinking about getting the Roku 3. The total cost with the HDMI cable and TV mount was keeping me from making the purchase. In total it would've been over $120 for the additional items. Good thing I waited, because this give me everything I wanted to stream Netflix for only $35. It's out of sight and simple to use. Searching for movies couldn't be easier and I no longer have to use my Xbox and pay for Xbox Live to access Netflix or YouTube.<br /><br />It's the best tech purchase I've made all year.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool game had a lot of fun with it would highly recommended this game will continue to play as much as I can
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The watch has a good weight and size to it. I have somewhat smaller wrists, so anything over 40mm starts to look kinda stupid. The green looks really good, though I think the black one might look a bit more 'professional' or 'dressy'.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is it runs about 15 seconds fast each day - but that's to be expected with a mechanical watch. It can be adjusted, and I haven't tried to adjust it yet, so it can probably be brought under 10 seconds off a day.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My kids loved it! The musical songs are great to sing as  a whole family.<br /><br />We rented for 24 hrs on Amazon and it was not enough taking the length of the movie.  I wish Amazon would rent it for 3 days instead for $2.99.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is a very good game and I found nothing bad or wrong in its recommend that whoever is reading this buys the game and plays it.<br /><br />It is a very good game and I found nothing bad or wrong in it. I recommend that whoever is reading this buys the game and plays it.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Expected it to be another shallow 'shoot em up' (which I do like), but the movie had surprising depth in the development of their characters.  I would recommend it.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down. The dad and the son are really the main characters, but the mother really intrigued me, even though she is not as central of a character.
0141345659|5.0|The book got to my house so quickly. I actually just finished the book recently. I've never read anything so amazing. It makes you cry , think, and laugh all at the same time. Definitely buying another book from this author!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Completely not what I thought it was going to be but very good. Would have liked a little more background on how it all started.

B00E66QPCG|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a newbie when it comes to day trading but I don't claim to know everything there is to know either. There are a lot of things that I didn't understand and, because of that, I am sure that I am not making as much money as I could be. Now, after reading The Simple Strategy, I feel more confident in my trading abilities than ever before. It's almost as if a light bulb was turned on over my head as I was reading along. The way the author explained certain aspects of trading, especially the intraday trades, was almost as if he was sitting down with me and showing me step-by-step what do to and why I should do it. I think that is the best way to explain something to someone rather than just telling them to do something without that all-important explanation. This book is very well written and worth far more than the asking price. I have read it through many times now and each time, I find something new to focus my attention on and see if I can use that to make my trading abilities better. Whether you have been trading for a while now or are just getting started, this book will help you immensely.
0515153656|1.0|I'll toss a brief one-star review into the pot.<br /><br />This book is so fantastically bad, so poorly written, so monumentally implausible in every detail both large and small, that it makes me question the very working of the average human mind when I see that it has ten times as many five-star reviews as one-star reviews.<br /><br />I think there must be a common class of reader who simply lacks the part of the brain that asks questions like \\"does this make sense?\\" or \\"is that how somebody would act in this situation?\\" or \\"is that remotely plausible?\\". Instead they just read the pages and enjoy little jolts of amusement and thrills of excitement as random violent events transpire.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the series of Downton Abbey-my sister kept telling me that I would love it and I resisted-she finally convinced me and I started watching it and now I am hooked. I mean I keep watching the same episodes over and over.
140006922X|5.0|This is a fascinating book with a historical perspective on Jesus the man. It's unfortunate that such a well-written well-researched book by a religious scholar is being attacked by some with pre-conceived biased notions of the authors motivations. It's just a book by an academic.
B00008GKEG|5.0|recommended<br /> the beatles anthology so far so good better than other records i had buy and for a cheap price
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Written by a historian who studied the history of the times: rich in eye-opening details.<br /><br />It's a good book because the author has taken actual historical writings and evidence, and used them to present Jesus the man.<br /><br />Whereas many supporters of Christianity, instead, take the theology of Christianity, and use their theology to mine history for whatever data may fit into their beliefs, and discard other facts.  Using that thought process, actual history is ignored and often buried for centuries.<br /><br />After reading this book, I have tremendous respect for the cause and the personal courage of the man, Jesus, and a lot of sympathy for his under-estimating the strength of Rome and the wealthy priestly class at the Temple.  I admire Jesus's causes of fair treatment of the poor and dispossessed, for justice in governing, and for being against corruption.<br /><br />It's important to read this book, and then read the New Testament.  &#34;Zealot&#34; will add to your understanding of the New Testament.<br /><br />By using factual data as a base, the author:<br /><br />--Explains Jesus's remark in Matthew 10:34:  &#34;Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth.  I have not come to bring peace, but the sword.&#34;  Explains why Jesus preached that the meek would inherit the earth, and the currently wealthy would become poor.  Jesus was an activist and a revolutionary, who intended to create a new kingdom on earth, in Jerusalem.<br /><br />--The book tells of the long history of revolutionary activists in Galilee who were caught and killed by Rome.  Jesus was one of those activists.  The Galilee of his childhood, with its small farmers, had been changed by the demand for day laborers to build a nearby city, and by taxation.  Jesus wished to overthrow the wealthy class of priests in the Temple of Jerusalem, and create a new kingdom, on earth, in Jerusalem, with himself as king.<br /><br />--Tells of how James the Just, Jesus's brother, continued with the Jesus movement, still adhering to the Jewish faith, but with an emphasis on helping the poor and redistribution of wealth.  How this message spread to Greek-speaking people outside Jerusalem and to Rome.<br /><br />--How Paul added his own egoistic imaginings to Jesus's message.  How Paul was called to Jerusalem by James the Just, and told to stop changing the new religion.  How the new congregations outside of Israel heeded Peter's and James's warnings to not listen to Paul.<br /><br />--Tells how the destruction of Jerusalem and all of its people in the year 70 ended the actual Jesus movement, as it was created by Jesus.  With the &#34;mother church&#34; and its leaders destroyed, Paul's imaginings were then free to spread without opposition by the actual movement Jesus began, and without regard to reality.  The book explains how the Jesus the Jewish rebel of history was thus cast aside.<br /><br />--Explains who wrote the New Testament, and why, and when.  How just a few letters of Peter and James the Just were included, yet a great many of Paul's letters were included among the writings chosen centuries after Jesus's death to become today's New Testament.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|If you are purchasing the Playfully Delicious Kitchen, I highly recommend purchasing this starter set as well.  The kitchen has spots on the shelf to hang the utensils and stand the plates and shakers and the pots fit perfectly on the stove top.  It matches the kitchen, and truthfully, should just be included with the kitchen.  The kitchen looks pretty empty without the pieces on it.  If you don't have the kitchen, the set is still nice, but there are probably others that are just as good.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Not the great novel, but certainly one that pulls you in and holds the reader till the end. Story line others can tell, I just let you know how I related...........the answer is; I did!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This is an interesting game that has good art work, deep strategy, and even has a challenging single player mode. I do have a few issues with it though. That being the high cost of new cards and the fact that you have to have a internet connection at all times, even win playing the single player campaign. Though that's more a case of horrible spotty internet were I live than a game problem. All in all its still a great game.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|I've read so many reviews to which cover would be best for my new Kindle Fire HD and this one (now through having one) is the best. Previously I've bought Marware MicroShell Folio Lightweight Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;, which was a mistake and returned it. And then I really started to shop around and read everyone's reviews. I took my chances with this one and I have no complaints. It is leather with solid craftsmanship. Love the rotation! I found it truly helpful to have it vertical when reading a book while eating lunch or when using the cookbook. And then having it horizontal, when watching movie, etc. The hand strap is convenient but I discover I like to read it on the stand now. When the case is closed (it is best to use the elastic band to keep it shut) it will keep the Kindle sleep. Think $30 was worth it to protect my $200 Kindle Fire.
B0090SI56Y|5.0|I caught this over the weekend because it just looked so bad ass since they released the first trailer many months before. Maybe I'm the minority here but I'm a big fan of all the X-Men films & really enjoyed the first Wolverine movie too despite it's mixed reviews. Hugh Jackman owns this role & Mangold & company have done a stellar job on this movie. From start to finish this film is enthralling & unlike Warner Brother's recent summer blockbuster, Man of Steel, The Wolverine doesn't contain any plot holes. Not surprisingly, The Silver Samurai character is altered in the movie but it's explained & makes sense for the story they're telling & this was also the best of the X-Men films since X-Men 2. While it's suspenseful & action packed throughout it wisely doesn't subtract it's high quality storytelling & character substance whatsoever. Like Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Wolverine definitely tackles the stereotypical superhero areas with maturity & sophistication, & thus capturing all of the best elements & grounded aesthetics to stand apart from the rest of the superhero film genre.
B007SGM084|3.0|If the quality of writing matters then these books will disappoint. If it's just a story you care to read then these books will intrigue. I wish E. L. James cared as much about basic writing as she did her basic recipe for a chapter. Annoying.
B0089LOG02|4.0|the book was hard to get started but did better as the story progressed. The multiple story lines were also difficult to follow at the beginning.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|So when I received this Microphone, it was amazing! Then i left it on all night and after reading reviews I had a whole box off 10 batteries ready to go.  The next day we recorded a session and after putting all the video together my lav mic only worked for the 1st 10 minutes, and it was horrible scratchy low volume sound at that!<br /><br />So I tried it in different cameras and computers trying to convince myself the sound was ok, it does sound better on some devices vs others. Tried new batteries.. etc<br /><br />I feel stupid for ordering another mic because i was past the 30 day return limit, but I went ahead and ordered a new one. And it sounds perfect with the battery that came with it! I put the new Mic battery in the Mic that was having noise low sound issues,  perfect again!<br /><br />So a long story short is that they advertise on the page that it takes 2 types of batteries. (CR2 and LR44) The LR44 came with the unit, the CR2 most likely would not fit. Aren't all button batteries the same?  No, I figured out the hard way they are not the same. I purchased a 10 pack of Philips LR44. I have 10 batteries that do not power this unit in a sufficient manner.<br /><br />So make sure you try changing the battery manufacturer before throwing this thing out or returning it.<br /><br />I saw someone comment that they use Duracell D357 (Energizer 357, Maxwell SR44W) it is 1.55 V and 165 mAh  I wonder if the extra 'umph' helps it or hurts it.<br /><br />The correct battery for this Mic is a Duracell LR44 (Energizer A76, Maxwell LR44) it is 1.5 V and 60 mAh and as I have proved some of them wont work, like the Philips brand LR44.(unless i just happened to get a bad batch of 10 old batteries from Amazon)
B000K3HTRY|4.0|Doesn't paint a complete picture for Dom/Sub relationships but it was a good start to understanding it.  Humorous and entertaining...brilliant acting by Maggie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very interesting read. At the beginning of the story, I didn't really much care for Nick or for Amy. They seemed like people who I definitely wouldn't get along with, but that didn't make me want to put this book down. I was sucked in from the beginning and then, boy there was the TWIST in the storyline and I was like an addict. I had to see what was going to happen next. How was this story going to end? I was up late at night reading just so I could get that much closer to seeing what would happen. I couldn't believe how crazy Amy was! She was a freaking psycho! I definitely couldn't see how anyone could stand her. But I guess, Nick and Amy were basically meant for each other. By the end of the book, I was almost literally exhausted from the crazy ride. I've never read anything quite like this book and I'd definitely want to read more from this author in the future.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to know what the heck I'm babbling about and wants to see what all the fuss is over this crazy thriller of a book.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is watch feels substantial.  It is not a flighty vanity watch with an electric movement.  This watch has everything I could hope for in a military style watch.  Price is great, accurate time keeping.  Easy to read.  While is not my old stainless steel bubbleback, it is exactly as advertised.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love period pieces like this.  It made me very happy to see Brendan Coyle in it, but other actors were wonderful too.  I loved Queenie &#34;sitting with her bees.&#34;  Also enjoyed Queenie and Twister singing together in the episode when he thought he saw his sister.  All good.<br />The two sisters, Pearl and Ruby, are hilarious.  Dorcas Lane and Laura are just beautiful.  I enjoyed the whole season.
1591845831|3.0|I am confused who this book was written for. Having picked it up, I assumed it was for people who were already in the marketing field and had at least a relatively small baseline of knowledge. At times, this assumption seemed validated by the way the author would talk, rarely going into unnecessary detail to further his points.<br /><br />With that being said, two-thirds of this book was a reiteration of basic consumer behavior, a subject that folks in my niche are well-versed in. I did enjoy it, as the college course Consumer Behavior was the very class where I was &#34;enchanted&#34; into the field.<br /><br />I was hoping to close the book in careful contemplation about how I could use new insights to better serve my clients, but unfortunately I must move on to other books and articles.<br /><br />Guy wrote this book like a series of succinct blogs, which I appreciate because it makes it easy to read in multiple segments through my busy day without getting lost. He writes from his experience, which in some cases is highly interesting and valid, and in other cases I disagree with his assertions. If there it's one thing I want to emphasize, it is that his experience is anecdotal; what works for him and his clients might not necessarily work for you. Take, for instance, a restaurant chain. Though it may be localized, it is still a chain and people will have a more difficult time personifying it than they would a sole cupcake shop. The chances are if this chain limits their SMM promotions to 5%, people's BS detectors will go off.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who dip their toes in marketing but don't specialize in it. I think it could be a handy guide and a great conversation starter; I just was expecting something geared towards my market a bit more. If you read the negative reviews for this book, I think you will find that a lot of us expected a higher level of insight.

1401923127|5.0|Having recently listened to Bruce Lipton speak at the annual IONS (Institute of Noetic Sciences) conference I was excited to read this book. Bruce has a knack for taking the information obtained from his scientific background in Biology and making in understandable to someone who has no education in the field of biology. The format Bruce uses, as well as his style, are very \\"user friendly\\" and this made for an enjoyable read.<br /><br />As for the material itself, I found that I learned a great deal about the field of Epigenetics and it is refreshing to hear another voice disagreeing with, in my biased opinion, the deterministic views coming from the choir of the majority. Certainly I am no expert in the field of genetics; however, anytime I hear that scientists have found \\"the answer\\" I shudder. The fact that DNA sequencing was supposed to be the holy grail of all things living is no different than when the world was flat and at the center of the universe. I do not dispute the fact that DNA research and the field of genetics is important, but when part of that conclusion says that Mother Nature decided to make 96% of that DNA useless (junk DNA) I tend to believe that there is more to the situation than what we are perceiving or what we have the ability to measure. Perhaps the beleifs of genetic determinism are incomplete, perhaps we need better tools, and perhaps the final word on DNA has yet to be written; however, one thing is certain, the fact is that we don't know everything there is to know and we will only expand our awareness by being open to new ideas.<br /><br />Science is about discovery and a desire to get to truth, yet it seems that many \\"so-called\\" scientists are no different than the religious zealots that burned people at the stake 500 years ago. Anyone remember Giordano Bruno?  So, what does this have to do with the \\"Biology of Belief\\"? Well, in this book Bruce goes against the deterministic view and says that it is not only genetics that shape our inner world, it is the environment as well. This book is one of self-empowerment because it says that you aren't just a machine following orders that came from pond scum 700 million years ago.  You have the ability to transform your outer world and INNER world.  Certainly empowered people are healthier and harder to control then their unaware counterparts and they use less pharmaceutical interventions. Hmmm, so by being aware of our power we take money out of the pharma's pockets, who are the ones providing so much of the funding to the scientific quacks. No wonder the mainstream scientists resist work such as this, it's their pocket book stupid (you need to read the book to get the gist of that last statement). In the end, ironically perhaps, the quasi-scientists of today will go the way of their ancestors and go extinct because they refuse to look at the facts, to adapt to the environment and view new ideas with curiosity rather than dogma. Perhaps the title of Bruce's next book could be something like, \\"Did dinosaurs wear lab coats?\\"inner world, it is the environment as well.

1878424319|5.0|The Ten Commandments, the Tao, the \\"Golden Rule\\", and also the \\"Four Agreements: what do they all have in common? Well, I'm sure there are many things; however, I want to focus on something that resonates with me.  It seems to me, and I am admittedly biased, that so many of life's great lessons are actually quite simple in their instruction, yet not always so simple in their application. Don Miguel's book, \\"The Four Agreements\\" outlines one major idea/agreement, \\"Be impeccable with your word\\" that is supported by three other \\"agreements\\": \\"Don't make assumptions\\", \\"Don't take anything personally\\", and \\"Always do your best.\\"<br /><br />The author feels, as do I, that when a person implements these agreements consistently into their life then the quality of life will improve; however, as is so often the case, some of us are quick to agree with an idea, we say we \\"Know that already\\" and then we go back to our old ways. As with any great wisdom, applying the idea consistently into our relationships with others, and with life in general, is the true challenge. If things aren't working for us, then perhaps we need to alter our perceptions and establish new \\"agreements\\" that better serve us and humanity. Although I enjoyed this book and the message it shares, I am a long way from consistently heeding the words it contains. Bottom line: if everything in your life is working, then you don't need this book. If, like most of us though, you are looking to find ways to make improvements, then this book is one more tool to help you do so.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love this album! It is extremely different from their older stuff which makes sense cause they aren't teenagers anymore. People keep hating because it sounds different but I think the songs are really sweet and the music itself is a lot different so if you are hoping for the old stuff you would be disappointed but if you listen to it without thinking it is the backstreet boys you will really love it.

Must try for horse lovers.<br />Update: not 10 minutes after writing my first review my kindle fire HD froze while playing this game.  I am not sure if it is related but I am suspicious.<br />Second update: after staying away from this app I have had no more issues with my kindle.  It's a great app, I just wish I could play it!

B00BLF9FOK|2.0|Man, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting old! And believe it or not it shows! A lot.  I don't know why I liked this movie so much, I really don't. This movie warrants a 2 and a half star rating yet I switched it to 3 and a half star review. I just liked this movie for no reason. It kept my attention span. Arnold, who is now I believe 60, and when he filmed this at 58, seems to be taking serious damage at every step he takes. Sadly, it might be time for this old man to hang in the towel soon. This film isn't that great, this movie isn't even good, it's bad, and really lame, and laughable but for some reason I liked it. Not because of Arnold, Arnold, hangs on to this film like a dirty towel basically. Well anyways let's get on with this review, let's start with the negatives. The negatives include the cast, plot, Arnold Schwarzenegger, action, music, character development, the acting, and screen time. O.K didn't I tell you that there's a lot to hate? Yes, I know this is going to cause a small controversy from my fans. Well anyways most of this cast are just very poorly chosen.  While I love Arnold, I really think he should have been recast with someone like maybe Bruce Willis. Yes, I know I critically bombed Bruce, for Looper, but he wasn't right for that rule, I think he would have been perfect for this one though. And then we have Ms. Genesis Rodriguez, who was poorly cast, as well as comedian, Luis Guzman. For starters Luis just doesn't look serious enough to be a deputy. Well I can kinda see it but he doesn't seem right. And as for Genesis, how convincing can she seems as a cop? Not too much.  This movie's plot is very weak, and a bit loose. This movie falls threw a couple plot holes. Such as having too villains and neither really having any reason to do anything. I mean the plot is a group of people must defend their small town from a lot of invading bad guys. Wow, plots now a days are getting really thin. How far this go / a guy can tries to get to Mexico and withthe help of a dozen dudes with guns and his 100 mile per hour car a lover hostage he can do it! This is nothing we haven't seen another hundred times before. Arnold, Arnold, Arnold.  Dude I think I have said enough about you, so let's move on. The action is very minimal, for a film that has little else to do then for explosions and action. The plot has nothing to do, it's so bored. I think they should have added more action, for the actors to do. Everybody just looks lazy in this film. The action is poor even when it happens, it's not well done and the action is 5 minutes in between each other. The music in this movie is very minimal, and not very well chosen. The music adds little to the action, and makes everything happening less exciting in my opinion. Man, why couldn't they pick up some of the soundtrack to Fast Five, and Rango and mash it up and turn it into \\"The Last Stand Soundtrack\\". Now that would be music to remember. But here we have a bunch of UN admirable music to add. Man one of the worst things with this movie is its character development. I mean i really just don't get any of the characters. I mean we have Johnny Knoxville as Lewis, and I really don't get who he is. All I know is that he has a museum and has a relic gun which he has named. I mean what? And also we have Frank Martinez, the villain who I really don't understand at all. Why, the heck is he in prison to begin with?  I don't really get it.  This film gives little screen time to the people involved including Johnny Knoxville's Lewis who we see only  for about 20 minutes altogether, which gives us no time to  develop his character as I have already talked about. Also they should have shortened, Peter Stormare's character, to add more time for the main villain to develop some more.  And shorten Forest Whitaker's character so that we can have more time for Sheriff Ray Owens, played by Arnold, to develop. Now onto the positives with this film including,  Rodrigo Santoro, ending, visuals, car stunts,  and just that I liked it. Rodrigo, was excellent as this film's villain, even though he was given a very small time on camera he was excellent in all of it. He really can act like a villain. He scared the heck out of me, he did. He was very devilish.  The ending was an epic car race between Arnold and Rodrigo's character; I felt that Rodrigo really had a chance of getting away until Arnold's Sheriff showed up at the bridge. The race and battle at the bridge were really suspenseful. I thought Arnold was going to kill him and the same for Rodrigo.  The visuals were spot on as well. Even though there wasn't much visuals needed, when the car crashed into the polish vehicles it looked really good!!! The car stunts were epic, when Rodrigo's character crashed into the police car and flipped it over that was really cool.  Believe it or not I just liked this movie. I know it doesn't justify why I would rate this 3 and a half stars, what with all the negatives with this movie. I just liked it and that's that.  Everything I said is kinda miner for me. All in All, this is a pretty big disappointment, but I liked it anyways. Arnold is getting way to old and it dragged this movie down a lot maybe he should go back to politics or better yet - retire.

B005TYHUSM|5.0|The Jack Reacher character is likely the most interesting hero of any mystery I have ever read.  I love the books starring him, and can't put them down once I've started.  I have only 2 or 3 Reacher novels yet to read, and am saddened by that inevitable day when I will have read them all.  I may just have to reread them all again, they're that good!
B008JFUQ16|4.0|The minions are back for the 2nd time! I remember seeing Despicable Me in theaters, back in July 2010. That was a long time ago. I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the film when I first watched the trailers, cause I felt that they were gonna over use the minions and spend less time on the human characters, including Gru.  They didn't which surprised me but I was happy that they didn't over use them.  The minions.  I love em, they cranked out a few of the jokes, and while the jokes don't come out as many as you would wish this film still gives out a few decent  jokes.  I've only seen 3 animated films of this year out of 5 that have been released, and this is by far my favorite.  Also I tip my hat off to the trailer creators who  gave us minions, and no story, which  helped keep what would happen in the movie a  mystery, even though  I was angry at not seeing any footage from the film till March 2013, I was still happy.  Let's start with what's wrong with this film which includes the jokes, plot, and villain.  The jokes as I explained earlier don't come flying out and we only get a few at a time, which is but a miner issue to note. I still found the film funny in the most parts.  The plot has got to be the weak spot in the film.  The plots simple, too simple to follow. I get that this is a children's movie but please why not make it a little trickier to follow, because I started to get bored by the overly simple plot that barely grabbed my father's attention who attended the movies with me.  The major issue is the villain.  The voice acting for the villain is excellent and the character himself, it's just they didn't make him a very good villain.  I have to say this is a weaker villain than from the previous movie, believe it or not.  If they showed more of his scary and macho ness, he would make for a less tamed villain, but he's not and it really makes his character kiddie appropriate. It's really disappointing because he seems pretty cool with the sharkand the grenade but not after that short 5 minutes. Well after that short bad moments let's get on with the many good things with this film, which includes the  voice cast, animation, characters, minions, music, script,  switch of voice actors.  The voice cast is excellent! Steve Carrel truly knows what he's doing as Gru, and his voice acting is excellent! Kristen Wiig who was excellent in the first film as Mrs. Hattie, is back and bubbly as Lucy Wilde. She was excellent. Ken Jeung and Russell Brand are excellent too.  The big additions to the cast include Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, whose voice is  very convincing and excellent and finally the best of the newbie's and the second best of the cast behind Steve Carrel, is Benjamin Bratt as the  incredibly tame villain, Eduardo/El Macho.  Originally Al Pacino was cast as the voice of the character and had recorded all of his lines and animation for the character was already complete too, he stepped out because of creative differences on how the character should go.  I was upset at first due to being a fan of Pacino, and I still am, but I have got to say congratulations to Benjamin who was able to easily voice the character and his hard work as he had a week or two I believe too record his lines because the movie was going to be released in two months. Bratt did an excellent job as the character and I couldn't think of anyone who could have done it any better.  Top notch voice work from him.  The animation is excellent!  I loved the  animation done on the mall and characters; while cartoony it's excellent and sharp.  A beautifully film to watch, while he Monsters University film I felt had better animation this comes close to it! And better yet they used less money to create the excellent animation costing the most amount of money Illumination has ever spent on making an animated film which is 76-79 million that's not bad.  The characters are great! Lucy Wilde is funny and yet annoying at times a heartwarming character that I truly enjoyed watching. Floyd Eaggleson is also funny. The little wig making Chinese man is besides excellently voiced, is excellently funny and while his role is small, he is still one of my favorites.  I've already talked about the minions, but I think another word or too will do it. I think the minions are perfect; they are funny and my favorites.  The music is while not as memorable as the first films soundtrack is still excellent! You have to love the \\"Despicable Me\\" song.  I loved it! I was fairly disappointed that this film didn't include the song from the trailers, which played while Lucy kidnapped Gru.  But oh well you know, it's just to catch people attention.  The script includes loads of excellent dialogue that we get from El Macho and others.  A few clever one liners and things like that, some dialogue that mimics other things and stuff.  Now I already talked about this but I have decided that all of Benjamin Bratt's hard work deserves more recognizing and praise as he truly was excellent.  He worked hard to match the mouth movements for the animated character and matched it perfectly! An excellent cast member.  All an All Despicable Me 2, is not better than the first film and is more tame, and less enjoyable for adult audiences then the first film but still manages to  contain the magic with an excellent voice cast,  excellent colorful characters and those  loveably funny minions. B+<br />P.S we will see in December 2014 a spin off featuring the Minions solely. I'm not interested but we'll see. Are too many minions, too much? We'll know in December 2014.  Expect another Despicable Me movie because of the excellent  box office performance as well.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I bought this book simply because the title of the book amused and intrigued me.<br /><br />This book is laugh out loud funny at more than a few spots. It was so outrageously improbable that it is fun reading from the beginning to the end.  You cheer for Allan when he succeeds against all odds in the crazy predicaments he gets himself into.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for light, fun reading.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I read Beautiful Creatures, as a book, back in September 2012. I found it intriguing, and fine, not great, but fine all the same. And I was very excited to see this film. I was even planning on seeing it open night but my plans changed, and I didn't see it till it came to Netflix, and traveled its way to my mailbox this June night. After previously viewing \\"The Host\\" and \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2\\" I was a little worried, watching this film, that it would turn into one of those films, which I definitely didn't want. After viewing the trailer back in September, I found myself irritated by the southern accents, which actually, when you watch the movie aren't that bad. Compared to the likes of Tom Hank's in \\"The Terminal\\" anyway. This film will do some harm to the book though. So I warn the book readers, who read the book to NOT view this film. It  trails, deeply away from its source material, which made me mad of course. Well anyway, let's start with the dark, which include the character development, differences from the book, rushes the plot, and chemistry between the leads, flashback sequences, awkward moments, and the climax. This film feeds us little character development from anyone besides the two leads Ethan, and Lena. I mean I would have liked to see more screen-time for the character of Link (played by the excellent, Thomas Man) to develop.  As well as the beautifully, sexy Ridley, to develop. Also Macon, Emily (whose story sadly was never concluded), Amma, and Aunt Del, and Larkin. All those excellent, book characters came to the screen almost disappeared, really.  Plenty of the book characters never even made it to the screen, being axed from the book.  These excellent characters were given way less screen time then they needed and deserved. It's disappointing. As I have talked about before the film was almost completely different from the book. For starters half of the characters never made it to the film, Larkin, instead of being a dark caster, is a light caster,  Ethan's dad appears not once in the film, Amma, is the librarian, Macon, is not an Incubus, he is but a caster. Plus, half of the humanity from the book and love scenes that show Lena and Ethan, together falling in love are absent. And the ending is almost completely redone.  It's a big disappointment.  This film rushes its plot along as if it had been running late for a very important date.  Instead of having Lena, and Ethan, slowly falling in love, they are rushed and fall for each other in days, it takes time, and it lost its cute romantic story, by rushing the love. I hated the flashback scenes, it just looked fake, something you see in a b rated documentary on the History channel. Ugg. This film includes a few un-necessary scenes. While I found the scene where Emma Thompson's character brings Alden's character brownies a powerfully acted scene, and creepy, I didn't find it necessary. The climax, oh the climax. The film, suggest threw out, that the choosing ceremony, for weather you'll be light or dark, seems to be a very edge of your seat  scary thing, but what happens isn't what you had been waiting for threw out the film, or what the trailers suggest.  I thought of Ridley's character, a complete badass, looking for a fight, but what we see at the end is a cowering mouse that runs away at the first sign of Lena, getting  claimed. What the f***. Wow, like that's what I was waiting to see. And the evil Sarafine seems to promise, that she isn't going down without a completely epic battle, to the death, with magic, like in Harry Potter you know? Well what we see is a little talk of what love is, pain of course, Sarafine says. Then she gets taken out of Emma Thompson's body and disappears.  Completely disappointed with that.  I would have, liked to see Ridley get her butt beat by Lena, then watch a 5 minute battle with Sarafine, before she dies. Well anyways onto the lighter side of the story... The light stuff include, the costumes, cast, acting, chemistry, sets, opening, special effects, and the music.  The costumes. Oh the costumes are beautiful.  They are well detailed, and very much pretty to look at. I love Ridley's costumes the most. They are sexy to look at and make you just wanna look at em, and pause the movie. Aunt Del's costumes are also festinating.  The cast is spot on. Young, and beautiful rising stars, Alice Englert, and Alden Ehrenreich are great as Lena and Ethan. Just how I pictured them looking. Viola Davis makes the perfect Amma. And Thomas Mann the best Link. The real other star studders and the third and fourth best cast (besides the leads) have got to be Emmy Rossum and Jeremy Irons. Emmy Rossum looks beautiful, and stunning as Ridley. And Jeremy makes the creepiest, shut in version of Macon possible. And of course Emma Thompson, Margo Martindale, and Zoey Deutch, are excellent too. The acting is good, not great but good. Emma Thompson has got to be the best out of the lot, on the acting part. She makes her evil character scary and creepy as well as a funny villain.  She was probably the most into her role. Emmy Rossum also seemed to be having funny as the showy beautiful villain. She had style, and stole the screen. Alice Englert, and Alden Ehrenreich are excellent as the leads. They can pull of good chemistry with each other, and deepen their characters.  The chemistry in this film is great as Alice and Alden, share greatly realistic looking attraction to each other. The settings were neat, and while they might be considered a rip off of Twilights location's I just don't think that way. The locations are beautiful. I love em. The opening is good, it's introducing Ethan's narrative, and he, himself. It starts fleshing out his opinions. It started out slowly well the first five minutes. It was good. Just him. It works well. The special effects I hear were mostly practical. And they were pretty neat too. Like when Lena and Ethan were in the theater and the smoke started pouring in, and the screen turned into a battlefield and no one but Ethan and Lena can see it, well it's pretty cool.  Plus, when the glass shattered in the classroom, which was pretty cool to watch. And knowing that the glass sequence was real made it neat to watch even more.  The music in this film is great. I loved the trailers song as well as a few others that were pretty nice to listen too. Well all an all Beautiful Creatures, isn't beautiful. It's one of the better films of the year and definitely better than Twilight and The Host, it's still cheesy, and could have been made better. Also I can think of at least a whole better movie, I think I shoulda directed this, thoughts? C+
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I think the show is very entertaining, and the book just added to the fun.  I was pleasantly surprised that the book wasn't just a gimmick. The plot and characters were well thought out, retaining the quirky nature of the personalities on from the show. I found it enjoyable to read.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I would prefer it be longer!
B005LAII8A|3.0|This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film.  For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved  killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include  Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table.  Whenever he's onscreen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted.  The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable.  This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the \\"kid blue\\" getting his knuckles cracked scene.  Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him.  The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well.  The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip.  The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small.  Every character was proven to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to.  All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was not what I expected and that is fine, but it does not resemble in any way other persons experiences.  There was a &#34;rebuttal&#34; written by a Christian minister and I'd recommend reading both to get a better perspective.  I guess we will not really know what heaven is like until we get there...and, hopefully, can stay.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|\\"Today we are canceling the apocalypse\\".  One of the many one liners this film had. I enjoyed this, and I knew I would.  The trailers showcased robots fighting monsters and b then three films came to mind. Godzilla, Real Steel, and Transformers. And it does actually resemble all of those. I read a few reviews for the film and was sold, as they were all mostly positive reviews so I went and saw this. I mostly enjoyed this for all its worth but I still had issues which I'll share with you know; the problems were the plot, character development, and Ron Pearlman.  The main issue with this film is the plot. The plot is nothing really. Just a mix bag of fights, and talking about fighting.  No plot. It irritated me, because I just didn't get it. I didn't get the plot at all. Theirs monsters all over the world and now only for robot things to fight them somehow. There's a scientist who goes inside a monsters brain and  then has to hide as they search for him, the monsters that is, and bla bla bla,  Ron Pearlman cameo, bla bla, Robot vs. Monster fight again, bla bla the end. Yep that's the entire plot.  No, plot at all only fights. It's pretty sad and well uh.  The character development is very poor as well. Charlie Day's character is as far as we know a scientist, who likes the monsters, and Idris Elba was a monster fighting robot operator but stopped after getting a never ending nose bleed, and Ron Pearlman is a black market  monster parts guy?  Plus we get a lead actor who all we know is that he lost his basically twin brother in a fight with the monsters. How did he get drafted into the monster fighting robot men guys group? How? Did he have a love interest?  We don't know anything. My final issues are with Ron Pearlman.  Ron Pearlman who I think was excellent as Hellboy in Hellboy 1 and 2, but this time he just feels un-necessary in the film and very much annoying.  Ron Pearlman's character didn't need to be in this film, and neither did Ron Pearlman. Ron's acting is horrible, and I hated everything about his character, I hated his screen time with Charlie Day who I did enjoy. I hated his character all together. The good things with this film include the acting, cast, animation, visual effects, music, lighting, attention to details, and entertainment value.  The acting is just fine for me. This might be considered debatable, as I have heard that's some people found the acting  average, as did my father who attended the screening with me thought.\\"The Chinese girl's acting was terrible\\" my father said, which I don't agree with, because he acting for me was excellent scents she was foreign, and I was able to understand her English, which is good.  Her acting was good and so was Charlie Hunnam, whose acting has been poorly received but I found it great.  The major cast members include Charlie Day and Idris Elba. I love Charlie Day. I always have loved his acting. It's excellent. This film is serious most of the time so Charlie provides us with the comical relief we need. His voice work in Monsters University earned him praise from me and his acting in this is earning him praise from me.  He's one of my current favorite actors, for his acting ability. He could play a realistic version of a scientist as well surprisingly.  Idris Elba is also a powerful cast member. I viewed him in June 2012's \\"Prometheus\\" and loved his realistic portrayed of a captain of a group. Idris Elba was excellent as the lead of a resistance against the monsters. He's an excellent actor and portrays the character realistically.  The animation for the robots and  monsters are excellently done. It's all beautifully  rendered and very sharp and realistic to the point I just loved it. The water was rendered beautifully realistically and everything was just perfect animation wise. The visuals are the same word as animation and it was perfectly done. The music was engaging and very fit in the scenes they were in.  The fight sequences with the monsters and the robots had perfect musical scores. They were engaging and original, and very load too.  Now another controversial  thing with this film is the lighting, which people found poor and too dark to see the fights and that. I have to disagree. I saw the fights excellently with the street of china filled with glowing colors and the monsters mouths filled with blue lighting. It's impossible not to see what's going on, because everything that's happening is filled with lights.  It was beautiful. This film has loads of details in the film. The animators and staff detailed everything from the water to the teeth of the monsters and the hands of the robots.  Everything is well detailed and just so realistic to look at its amazing.  This film is very much entertaining to watch.  The fights are well staged and exciting till the end of each one, the lights are colorful and entertaining to look at, and the leads keep your attention from start to finish. You could spend ten minutes just looking at a scene featuring the robots, it's just so cool and amazing to look at, and so dang realistic looking.  This is the film for fan boys and  young teens and boys.  Now as for the entertainment values for women I have none. Women and girls will most likely not enjoy watching this film, but men and teenage boys will. This is like what every boy dreams of. It's got everything to entertain the minds of kids for 2 hours.  This is the movie to  let the kids watch for 2 hours while you have some down time to yourself, it will keep their attention I will say that.  All an All this is a film with no plot at all but is so entertaining and fun and cool to look at that you really don't care all you want is more fights, cause of the excellent visuals.  B
B002ZG983M|5.0|Subject line sums it up. Don't want to give away ANYTHING because it's so good. Worth the investment even if you have never seen it.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|Beastly. Wow, I never that would be a movie title. Wow. But the title my dear readers, is not the problem with this film. Nope, we have actually worse things to tell about this film than its title. Well this film has issues, but anyways let's just get to the bad things with this film; they include the cast, acting, script, plot, and ending. This movie fails to cast a group of actors that actually want to be in this. I mean you go and look at Mary Kate - Olson and she looks like she would just love to get shot in the head rather than put on  the costume's and wigs and be all witchy. I swear I can think of at least 10 other actress's that would have been way better and more excited in the rule then her.  Alex Pettyfier is not a bad actor. It's just that while he's good in the role, he and Vanessa Morgan share no chemistry. Its way unrealistic. Zac Efron, however CAN share chemistry with Vanessa and make it believable. Alex, even though he's probably the best cast out of the lot, could have been replaced. It might have saved Vanessa, from suffering with poor acting.  The script is very mediocre, and cheesy. I find all the lines un-inspired and repeated threw out the film. It's like the writers couldn't find anything for the actors to do except call Alex \\"ugly\\", and for him to say \\"she will never love me\\", and \\"I'm so hot, and I'm so ugly\\" it's like shut up we get it.  None of it really works. It's all bland, bland, and bland.  And product advertisement, product advertisement. That goes with the plot to. It's so UN - original.  Okay, so I get it your trying to rip- off of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" okay- okay. Now what's new here? Where does this story go? I mean I feel like I'm watching a darker version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. So what do we have, that's new. Okay so we have a guy, a handsome guy, who knows he's handsome. Who  pisses off a witch girl, and gets turned into a monster. And so he needs a girl to turn him back by falling in love with him, and bla bla bla. What's original about that? That's Beauty and the Beast, but with a less attractive title. The ending was so ugg. It was unsurprising let's say that. Alex ends up saying a very cheesy line from the cheesy script, the two falls for each other they hug, kiss. The end. Oh and the dad ends up getting the same  thing his son got. Wow, I was so surprised by that very quick ending. Poor. Now onto the good things with this film which include, the make - up, opening, Alex Pettyfier, jokes, music. Okay so probably the highlight of the film is indeed the make - up. It is very well detailed, and very good eye candy. When I look at Alex's face after he turned into a ugly beastly character, he looked so neat. And while he looked d like a freak, he looked very well detailed. And realistic in the make - up.  I loved it, I just love the different tattoos and silver scars on his face, and neck, and arms.  It all works very well. The opening which was with Alex Pettyfier announcing how rich and beautiful, was very well acted, and even though the lines were very cheesy in that scene, and so very much absurd, it still was able to start the film out with the main idea on why he was so beastly, and it was just well a good introduction into the dastardly character Alex played.  This leads me into my next topic which is about how Alex suited the role. While I think he should been replaced with Zac, he wasn't a poor choice for the role. He was very convincing as the self - centered jerky character that is Beastly. And very convincing I really liked him. The jokes in this film are very good. While the jokes were definitely not supposed to be in this film and were done by accident (apparently) this film did hold me over for those few jokes that snuck their way onto the scripts. And I loved em!  I loved the opening music, which was catchy and got people's attention, Well All and All, this film is not a successful romantic film, and fails to become the classic \\"Beauty and the Beast' was, butwith the help of a few detailed works, and a very attention grabbing trio, we don't have a miss either.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|Intriguing and quick paced, the first half of the book keeps the reader wanting more.  However, into the second half, the plot comes to a standstill, with the main character being repetitive and annoying in most cases.  It was a quick read and the ending was nice.
B002SRQ214|3.0|I bought this chip a while back - at least 6 months ago. I finally finished building my first gaming system ever yesterday and ran a test on it and came up with a major issue. A pin on the CPU is bent and after reading that even a successful fix could fry my system I reached out to Amazon Customer service. Now because I ordered this part more than 90 days ago, regardless of only just putting it in I can not just do a straight foward swap, but at least I get my money back and can re order the processor. My gaming system (my first ever) for those interested contains:<br /><br /> Sabertooth 990fx motherboard<br /> 4 gigs Kingston Ram (intend to upgrade to 8 gigs next month)<br /> Samsung Blu Ray Player<br /> Samsung DVD player<br /> Samsung 1TB Hard Drive<br /> Sony Multi - card reader<br /> Asus GTX 770 2gig PCIE graphics card<br />Coolmaster Haf 932 Tower<br />Corsair 650 Watt PSU<br />Asus 24in HD - LCD monitor<br />AMD 3.4 GHZ processor - this is the item I am waiting now to get replaced or re odered<br />ASUS Sound Card (next week)<br /><br /> I have spent 2 years putting this rig together and had it not been for Amazon customer service I would be out $150! That's what I get for waiting as I buy the parts piecemeal. Great customer service from Amazon, though I can not comment on the actual processor yet.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a page turner for me! Loved the characters and the storyline. Not so sure if it is accurate historically in terms of the era, but it was a good read for me.

B005JTAP4S|4.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is a fanciful adventure that will pull you in and make you feel like you're there. The descriptions are really well done.<br /><br />Peter is just an ordinary boy who finds a key to a secret room. Once he opens that door his world will never be the same. Well actually he ends up in a totally different world full of talking animals, trees and paths. There are fairies, dragons, ghosts and every other creature you can imagine. Peter finds himself on a quest, which really turns into several quests. Every door, every passage, every path he takes, whisks him away to a new and challenging adventure.<br /><br />It is a story that will highly appeal to middle grade and young adult readers. What an adventure.<br /><br />I was given a copy by the author for an honest review and this is what I honestly think.
0691152640|1.0|Several times in the book, the author advises the reader to skip SEVERAL chapters ahead. And there's good reason for this, the book is mainly padding. It was obviously rushed into production to make money off the financial crisis and give the author an excuse to be interviewed on television.<br /><br />The only things of value to be seen are a few graphs. And the spectacle of so so many people giving such an unreadable, boring book rave reviews.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, addictive game for young children and adults! it does get slow at times but be patient, it DOES work!
B00785P2QC|2.0|In order to advance in this game you have to spend a ton of money. Why not make the original game cost a bit and then leave the rest free.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I don 't know how it works as noted in other reviews but works GREAT on my kindle fire. Highly recommend this.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Could you get a better cast with better chemistry.  Malkovich steals the show with his insanity.  Helen Mirren delivers again.  And, Bruce Willis is his steady self.  It was what we expected & weren't let down
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As well-written as any novel, but it's history, not fiction, and deals compellingly with a fascinating time and locale most Christians have never bothered to learn anything about: the world Jesus was born, lived, and died in. I learned a lot, and enjoyed every minute of it. I happen to be a Christian myself (though not a God-botherer), and I couldn't care less that the author is...OMG!...a Muslim (or, as Pam Geller and her mouth-breathing minions might put it: \\"A DEVOUT MUSLIM!!!!!!!!!!!\\"). As though, in all of history, no DEVOUT CHRISTIAN!!!!!!!!!!!! ever wrote a history of the Middle East of Mohammed's time. Gimme a break.<br /><br />If you, like many another thinking Christian, have ever been troubled by the obvious split personality of Jesus -- part kumbiyah-singing barefoot hippy, part scourge of money-changers ordering his disciples to buy swords and abandon their families -- you may find in this book a helpful historical context to assist you in the thought process that is so important in order to grow in your faith. If, instead, you're one of those literalists who insist that every word of the Bible is the unquestionable Truth from the mouth of an incomprehensible God, then don't bother.

B005PK57IK|5.0|The good wife continues to present a believable plot with plenty of twists and turns to hold one's interest.  The characters mature into real scoundrels or some surprising &#34;good guys&#34;, effectively eliciting a growing emotional response from the viewer.  If real lawyers behave like this I can see why they are so disliked!

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I liked this book. It has a Hunger Games feel to it, but very interesting concept. I've read 2 of the 3 books in the series, and plan to finish book 3 soon.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I dont usually review things usually but I had to review this. This thing is just amazing had it since Friday 7/26 has been in use everyday since that day. Bought it so my mom could easily stream Netflix/Youtube from her Ipad, but use it from my phone now alot more.<br /><br />The only downside I cant think of is it doesnt support enough apps at the moment but that is to be expected with any new technology Im sure in the coming months alot of apps will be supported by this.<br /><br />Very easy, Very smart Google nailed this right on the head!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book. Poignant, interesting, historical, with great characters that you want to continue getting to know even after you finish the book.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Good book, but to be fair, it's written from the journalist's perspective for the most part. It is however compelling and worth a read. Scary doesn't begin to describe the situation there. Enjoy (or not). It's a compelling but unsettling read...

6301797906|3.0|The movie is awesome, its a classic and I have nothing bad to say about it, Everyone should watch this
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I saw the movie twice and read the book all within a week, so I feel fairly confident in my credibility regarding this review. Quite a lot of people seem to think that the story is too unwieldy and hard to follow, but for those who prefer more sophisticated story telling, that's not the case at all. Though I suppose if your standard fare is more along the lines of Fast and the Furious 72 or Twilight, then perhaps you SHOULD move on.<br /><br />I would say that watching it twice is pretty much a must. The first time through, just follow the individual stories and the main characters' plots. The second time around is really the best time to dive into the subtle nuances and foreshadowing hidden in the story as a whole. Following that approach would really enlighten most of the people who seem to be otherwise stumped by the sheer scale of the undertaking.<br /><br />Visually the movie is absolutely stunning and the acting is very strong 99% of the time (though there is one scene in particular where Tom Hanks' approach makes me shudder with horror, but it's a very short scene, so thank God for that...). Even the soundtrack is absolutely delightful and well worth a buy if you happen to go in for things like that.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb film and I honestly can't recall the last time I've been so in love and enthralled by a movie/book in the last decade. So don't believe the naysayers! Rent it from Redbox or Amazon and draw your own conclusions, if nothing else.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am not a 'soap' opera kinda gal, but I got so caught up in these people's lives I couldn't stop watching! The writing is exquisite, the costumes and art direction is fascinating and beautiful to watch. Enjoy!

B0000029AP|5.0|AEROSMITH-TOYS IN THE ATTIC: Arguably AEROSMITH's most important, thoroughly satisfying album, as well as the one that broke 'em through to the big time via the sleazy smashes SWEET EMOTION and WALK THIS WAY (the latter became a huge hit all over again as a groundbreaking RUN-DMC reboot). Slam-bang BIG TEN INCH RECORD was a gleeful take on jump blues bandleader TINY BRADSHAW's double entendre oldie (he also penned the YARDBIRDS/'SMITH staple TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN'). Meanwhile, YOU SEE ME CRYING's piano driven power balladry compared favorably to DREAM ON...a far cry from their nineties deluge of cookie cutter love songs. TOYS' head spinning title track, the boot-stomper NO MORE NO MORE, and ROUND AND ROUND's bloozey mantra resonate with JOE PERRY and BRAD WHITFORD's muscular axe flash and STEVEN TYLER's trademark paint-stripping caterwaul...in short, there's not a bum track within earshot. This was AEROSMITH's swaggering high water mark during their first golden period...a rebellious smack in the head from the only Boston-bred hard rock band that ever really mattered.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE TREASURES
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|I  was a  little  apprehensive  at  first,  but  was  won  over  by  the  charm  of  the  various  characters  and  eventually  bought  in  on  the  various  plots.  The plot  twists  were  predictable,  but  there  were  plenty  of  moments that  made  me  smile  and a  few  that  made  me  laugh a  lot.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Whomever wrote this guide was very selective in its level selection.  I understand there are literally hundreds of levels but I was stuck on one for about two months and of the 10 or so levels he selected it was there.  All the levels that everyone I know were stuck on they weren't there either.  Level 65, 88 and 147 just not there. Don't waste your time downloading.
0451169514|2.0|I don't know what struck a wrong note with me about this book.  Please note that I have only read one other Stephen King book, 11/22/62, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I think the problem with this book is that it's way too long for the amount of action that happened.  Also, because the book switches from the past to the present, much of what happened when the characters were kids happened again in the present, making for a lot of repetition.  The ending was predictable, and was underwhelming for the amount of time I invested into the book.<br /><br />I recommend you check out 11/22/63 over this.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|this is a great fun game and I flew through levels 1-30 quite fast but am now stuck at 31. A hints button would be nice--but even better would be the ability to skip a level that has you stumped and go back to it.
157330087X|5.0|If you like SRV, you need to add this tribute album to your collection.  Since my Grandson is trying to get anything, and everything, associated with SRV (books, cds, dvds, etc.). this was a no-brainer for him.

1623420148|5.0|I bought this book because I was looking for one that had 5 stars since the last few books I read weren't that great. This one had over 800 five star reviews and I am adding one more to it. It was very well written. There wasn't a dull moment in the entire book. It was simply a great read. I highly recommend it to everyone and anyone.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|[...]<br /><br />Wow. I just finished reading this book and was just hit by a barrage of so many emotions. Just, wow. In the last few chapters alone, I cried, smiled and was filled with the kind of small, budding hope that comes in the aftermath of something sad. I picked up \\"Eleanor & Park\\" after seeing it on the recommended books section on Amazon, guessing that it was of a similar genre to Jennifer E. Smith's books, which are my new summer obsessions. And with a name like Rainbow Rowell, I knew I was in for something special.<br /><br />No one forgets their first love. When Park reluctantly shares his seat on the bus with the eccentrically dressed new girl, he never, ever suspects that he'd end up falling in love with her, quirks and all. Eleanor, with her untamable red hair and slightly-larger-than-average size, quickly finds herself the brunt of cruel jokes and sneers. Even after school, she returns to a home with an abusive stepfather, a cowering mother, and four younger siblings she has to take care of. The two star-crossed misfits are smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts--but they're brave and desperate enough to try.<br /><br />What's clear from the start is just how young Eleanor and Park are. Yeah, I know I'm just a teenager myself, but the innocence that you see in the two protagonists are unmistakably there--and it's what makes their story so endearing. Throughout the story, Park clings onto the belief that love, even when it's happening in tenth grade, can be true and lasting. But what Ms. Rowell does extremely well in the face of such seeming naivete is transform it into something beautiful, something hopeful. And she does this by reminding those of us who have had our first love that that's exactly how we felt. Take, for example:<br />Eleanor made him feel like something was happening. Even when they were just sitting on the couch.<br />This line struck me right in the heart. Because that's what being with your first love is like:the familiarity, the comfort, like you're sharing something with one another even if you're not expressly doing anything. The way Ms. Rowell evokes these emotions and empathy transcends the novel past a typical high school love story. Instead, it's the truth, sweet and simple as that.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park themselves are such interesting characters to read about as the story progresses. Eleanor is, without a doubt, quirky and different, wearing sharkskin suits and neckties around her ponytail. But even if you don't wear men's clothes or do anything eccentric like that, you can still relate to Eleanor because she's deals with pretty normal issues that other people have to deal with in their lives, like being bullied or having family problems. Yet she still maintains her cynical wit and, despite everything, an innocence that can't be taken away from her, something which grows when she falls in love for the first time. For Eleanor, her love with Park gave her hope and strength that kept her from falling apart in the face of these issues. For Park, on the other hand, his love with Eleanor gave him the opportunity to grow and really find himself. As the story progresses, Park becomes a much more active and dynamic character, someone who isn't afraid to wear eyeliner or kick a guy in the face for bullying his girlfriend. Through Eleanor and Park, Ms. Rowell reminds her readers just how big of a role our first loves play in our lives, unforgettably and irrevocably.<br /><br />\\"Eleanor & Park\\" is also beautifully written, allowing Ms. Rowell to convey subtle nuances and messages in the most poignant of ways. This is especially important, I think, in realistic fiction novels, since there isn't much heart-racing battle scenes or out-of-this-world magical powers to get the story moving. Instead, the author has to work mostly with two things: her characters and her language. There's nothing flowery about Ms. Rowell's prose. Rather, it's simple and to the point, and that'swhat makes it so striking. There's quite a bit of parallel structures used in the writing, which helps to really drive the point home. The same effect is achieved through her use of short, simple sentences. One of my favourite lines was:<br />I'm yours. The me that's me right now is yours. Always.<br />Wow, I just got tingles just from copying that down. How true is that? \\"The me that's me right now\\". Wow. I said 'wow' a lot in this review, didn't I?<br /><br />All in all, Ms. Rainbow Rowell's \\"Eleanor & Park\\" is a smart, poignant story about first love, with two endearing protagonists, simple, evocative writing, and the central message that there is always hope.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|Love scary movies and this one did not let me down. Kept me on my toes the entire time. Loved it.

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love this game and my grandkids did too hard to get them off. Easy to play and not much help needed.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I saw a lot of negative reviews before watching this, and after seeing it, it left me wondering:  what the heck do people want?<br /><br />It's so hard anymore to find something that is not derivative of something else coming out of Hollywood.  Was the plot completely unique?  Not completely.  Was it entertaining?  Yes, for me it was.  It was well executed, the special effects were very good.  I thought Tom did a good job, after reading several reviewers that didn't.  Some of those reviews were colored by their views on Tom's personal life and religious affinities.  Really?  I expect actors to entertain me.  If I were going to judge an actor by their politics, or world views, I would not enjoy a great many actors and actresses.  Similarly, I don't go into a movie looking to find plot holes or continuity errors.  I simply go to be entertained.  To take my mind off my life.<br /><br />I've amended my original review with the benefit of hindsight.  This movie stuck with me, and I've viewed it several times since.  For me, it was simply a very well executed movie.  And, it was good Sci-Fi.  Much better, in my opinion, than a lot of the Sci-Fi that the Hollywood machine has offered lately.  I remain surprised by those that rate it so low.  I wonder if they're not really fans for the genre, or perhaps movie critic types?  My whole family really liked it.<br /><br />So, entertaining? Check.  Good acting? Check.  Good special effects? Check.  Good directing?  Check.  Good story?  Yes, actually it was. It was derivative of other stories that have come before to some extent.  But the story had it's own vision.  Really, if you're going to whine about it not being completely unique, don't watch Hollywood movies.  It was unique enough, for me.  It was good Sci-Fi.  If you like Sci-Fi (and I love good Sci-Fi), I can't see why you'd come away not at least enjoying it.  For me, it was worth it.

B0094K1PW4|5.0|I know this movie got poor reviews when it was released in the theaters , but I cant figure out why. Its so well shot, the cinematography is fantastic, the story is great and for the most part it flows fast from start to finish. If you grew up in the 70's or 80's its fun to see too, because no kid could so easily sneak around like we did then. LOL  Great movie - a must rent !!

0307730697|5.0|I've read numerous action military thrillers and figured this would be an interesting story. I went ahead and got it and of course it is not like a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn novel which for this book was MORE than okay. It was exciting, interesting but it also touched my core being. I don't write many reviews at all so sorry this is not eloquently crafted. I just have to say this is an amazing book in so many ways on so many levels. I recommend it to literally every person I ever get into a conversation regarding books. I might even say the best book I ever read but just don't want to go there. You should LOVE this book -- period...

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|OMG, just finish already!!!  That was not a way to end a book AND the promise of a trilogy stretched out into two more?  This is why I REFUSE to buy the books now.  I did buy the first two but waited (after I read Sylvia Day was drawing this out) to get it from the library.  Why should I pad her pockets at that price???  I will gladly wait the extra month (after release) to finish this.  That being said...this was a good book but I would much read 300 more pages to get it done.  Ok, we got the sex, we got the twist (Hello \\"Reckless\\"...same sex tape scenario - kinda).  The more I write the more I think of every other AWESOME book I have already read.  But me being me - I have to finish the series.  I will just wait longer to get them from the library.

B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant will always be the BEST Doctor.  He is at his best in Season 4, particularly in The End of Time Parts 1 and 2.  Doctor Who??
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Great game, hate that the challenges are contingent on Facebook sharing. I hate getting game requests on FB, I am certainly not going to overload my friends with requests just to complete a challenge. Also, it is hard to earn coins, you can buy them, but really, it's not that serious1
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show and easy to view.  recommmend he entire series and would use this service again some time in the future
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this games so much that I play it every day every hours every minutes and every ascends thank you for puting it in my kindle app:):):):):):):0:0:0:0:0 thank you
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched through the first season in just a few days, and have to admit I wasn't disappointed in the least.  The storyline is good and has great character development.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the app  to but to wake up to your favorite songs u gotta upgrade and PAY for it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie has a great balance of both adventure and funny moments.  The ONLY thing we don't like is the death of a certain character, and we are hoping that he really didn't die and they bring him back in future movies.
B00B3EJ0OY|1.0|I didn't see it.  Turned it off when I realized it was not in English.  I will watch it soon when I have time to read the subtitles.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really thought this book was an interesting read.  I thought the author developed the characters in a way to make the reader want to know more about them.  The story moved along quickly and I wanted to keep reading until the end.  He brought up some interesting legal information and other matters that gave me much to think about.  It is obvious that William Landay had a career in law and knew how to present Jacob's case from both sides.  The ending was a surprise I didn't expect but showed the author to be very unpredictable. I really enjoyed the book and have recommended it to several friends.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Pretty good game I know you will enjoy it.I enjoy the food mixing game and the muck out game the best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions .. if you do its so so so so so so so so soo so much fun and you will love it..~ Gabby joy
B001BMKOZW|5.0|I chose this rating because the CD came in great condition and the shipping was quick. I'm very pleased that the disk came in a plastic album case. I love it.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|As always, The Killers aim to please with this amazing live show showcasing all their best tunes! An absolute must have in your collection!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think Minecraft is a great game especially on the Xbox and Computer. I just wish they added more in updates.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|The movie is wonderful....such an escape and so beautifully executed.  I'm watching the entire series again after reading the books at least twice.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This was not as fantastical as I had expected. There were a couple one-liners that were good but mostly a shallow rake burns a chick and carries on his shallow,rakish ways.  The best part of the whole movie was Bruce Jackson's short bit as the guard to the Emerald City- he could barely hold it together and that was a crack-up.
143353276X|5.0|Best study Bible!  Love everything about this purchase.  I really enjoy learning the extra facts and information this Bible provides.  Makes me want to be in the Bible and study more and more!
B0012TWRAO|5.0|RAM products are as magic as duct-tape or Velcro, you can do so much with them.The product is as discussed on all the websites that illustrate it; however, what the picture does not show is another piece that is essential to the mounting of the bracket to the handlebar of a motorcycle.  In order to prevent the attachment from slipping on the handlebar from the position it is mounted in, there must be a non-slip material placed between the horseshoe metal bracket and the handlebar.  What is not pictured is the piece that &#34;is&#34; provided with this unit that slips between the metal bracket and handlebar on the underside of the handlebar.  Without it you would need at least a piece of sheet rubber.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Long story about the chase to get the Panther, but I enjoyed the book even though it took time and effort to overcome all the obsticals the main character was involved with.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Not exactly deep, but definitely a lot of fun.  Good characters, good humor, happy ending, family friendly:  overall good movie.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I use it all the time and like it very much. It was easy to download and the videos are clear.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like the feel of this app. it works even better the Flash and it does not crash like Adobe Flash does. The video is sharp and clean.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I can now go on Facebook anywhere I go. The app is easy to use and does everything I want it to do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait until season 4 is available!  This has been a great series and I have enjoyed all the episodes.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|It was a great movie although  I did miss some of the original actors. The story line was great and they<br />leave you with the bad guy getting away so another G.I. Joe sequel should follow :)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Entertaining, funny, action, twists and great action. I only watch a few movies a year and this cast attracted my attention. The movie didn't diasppoint.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love love this movie! The music is fantastic and I was laughing the whole time - my latest obsession. Buy it!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Enjoyed the series, have seen all at one point. just got the box set for the HD blu ray.  nice package and movies played fine. a good time had by all.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not a huge Stephen King fan. I'll read one of his books every couple years tops. Having said that I will say that I read Under The Dome last year and 11/22/63 this year. Overall I really enjoyed this book. His description of the differences between 2011 and 1958-63 make one aware of just how much has changed during that time.<br />11/22/63 is, at heart, a love story, one which I found to be very effective. It brings up the question of what is more important, the good of the all, or the good of the one; or two in this case. It's a tricky question and what seems to be a no brainer, stopping the Kennedy assassination, becomes not so obvious. This reader suspected all along that leaving things as they are, or were, was perhaps the wisest course. But before that becomes clear one is taken on a suspenseful journey into the actions of Oswald and other assorted bad guys: an entertaining journey relating to a year in a rural Texas high school, and by the end, a moving journey of how a man, Jake Epping, decides how he can best love the woman he has fallen in love with way back in 1960. Recommended.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|We were recommended this movie as we are expectant parents and the movie is great. It follows 4 parents in Africa, Japan, US and Mongolia. It is amazing to see how resilient babies are and how the different cultures treat their newborns!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|But good weird.  They are making me use these words otherwise I would not be typing this.  Word.  Word.  Word.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, all the episodes this far have been great.  I love England have been there several times, so charming,<br />I can't wait for Season 4 to come.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Good older flick that I just now found out about.  Main actress is smoking hot.  Have to write 5 more words.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|So totally different from the movie! The author cleverly introduces the reader to the &#34;zombie plague&#34; by presenting short individual accounts from a wide spectrum of survivors/combatants from all over the globe after the worst is over. This might be from the point of view of a dog-handler in the U.S. or a deep sea diver in the Pacific(yes, the 'undead' can live under water!).
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I see other complaints about the app being changed but in some ways I like the update.  The animated maps seem to work better.  I keep getting ridiculous messages about 'unlocked achievements' though.  What the...
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I read the books and like this movie as well and the first three. Great characters,story and all brought to life by brilliant director..
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Riordan is an extraordinary author. His imagination and creative use of the Greek and Roman mythology make his books stand out above the rest. This is the 6th book of his that I have taken the time to read (1 day). His stories are captivating and the cliffhanger ending of chapters leave the reader wanting more. I am already planning on purchasing the next book in the series. I am a 15 year old with a love for literature and writing. He had inspired me to push my boundaries and write about something more unrealistic.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|It was eh,I really didn't care for it. The graphics were below subpar,I didn't like the action. Ok it just wasn't for me. Give it a try you might be different. But not me.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I have been blasting away at AIM for a month, since I got my Fire HD , and I cannot put it down. Beautiful graphics, especially in Tony's hall of armors, gorgeous backgrounds, and inventive, challenging gameplay. Warning: you have limited resources, and it takes forever to accumulate them, so choose your armors wisely (keeping one from each category active and upgraded is a good idea). Example: I spent 125,000 credits to build War Machine just because he looks cool, and am consequently stuck trying to chase down Modok 3.0. I should have built Hot Rod or Starboost, but now I'm broke! Have fun.
B004SEUJUU|4.0|I really like this movie,Hugh Jackman plays the part so well. He is wolverine. Good back story and all. Can't wait for the second one.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I love the series of movies because they were not cheaply done and are some of the better book to movie movies I have seen.I think J.R. Tolken would actually recognize some of his writing in the movies if he were to watch them today.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Awesome movie. Great for kids and adults too! Full of fun and laughter. Looking forward to watch the Despicable Me 2 now.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I should try to get my money back. I tried several times to get the product to install, and it failed every time. No explanation provided.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have a computer and have minecraft  on it and am wondering when they will put monsters on creative, and if you are reading, see what you can do
B004T4LUPW|5.0|The Kindle doesn't have access to the Google Play store where I could download the official Google Calendar app, and we keep all our appointments on Google Calendar. So we were very pleased to find this program and find that it is able to sync and display all our various calendars. Very nice, intuitive interface as well. Definitely worth the price!
1840220554|5.0|This was a wonderful gift and was really appreciated by the recipient. &#34;Nice to have it all together&#34; she said.
B00BI745AA|3.0|Unfortunately, with the exception of Fantine and Eponine, the cast cannot sing.  Visual effects are supposed to &#34;overwhelm,&#34; but they are a great distraction.
0634022296|4.0|This was purchased as a gift and I have been told it is very helpful to the Beatles fan musicians.
B0037NVM1I|1.0|Might be good if there was audio available. Many Amazon movies lack audio. I have learned my lesson and will no longer attempt to view them.
B001EO748M|4.0|It is good to have this set.  It has become an old friend and can be watched over and over.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|This movie has a great story, is very relevant even today, and has very good acting. It is one of those movies that gives you a lot to talk and reflect about, I would definetely recommend it.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|It is good to have this set.  It has become an old friend and can be watched over and over.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Too much shooting and cars crashing; not enough 'story' for me.  Not what I expected, but not as bad as it could have been, either.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|You want to understand how the US Government lied and cheated the American Indians this book is a must read.  Promises such as: these land will be yours forever as long as the sun shall rise in the east and set in west...... were just words to politicians.  Gee sounds just like the government operates today.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter loves this girl-conscious toy from Lego and kudos to them for being sensitive to needs of little girls.  It was perfect and she loves it!
B000FBJAF0|5.0|One of the best by Forsyth.  About loyalty and friendship.  The ending is a real surprise.  So those that cheat and read the end first should be warned you will spoil the book if you read ahead.
B005MMY5RK|3.0|I can view movies like this one and not have to pay extra.  As much as I have heard about this classic, I just didn't get it.  Loved the noir cinematography, but the story seemed a bit weak.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Most will likely recall the action,FX & swordplay sequences from Crouching Tiger, The Matrix, & the Tom Cruise MI franchise. Without a good original story, the dialogue makes the actors performances foolish. The result is 1 1/2 stars, about the same amount of time you will waste if you can bear to stick it out
B00AEFXTDQ|5.0|What a voice, what an actress.  Hudson can blow them away and effortlessly I might add.  The story is classic tale of rising to the top getting knocked down and going back up again.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A unique view on love. You'll reminisce, smile, and cry along with Chris Harte as you read. It makes you think &#34;What would I do?&#34;' Picoult has an amazing way of capturing her readers in difficult situations,
B004SOR4H6|5.0|awesome way to connect with friends (this is better than facebook) gain followers read tweets tweet your self retweet and favorite
B001G70M6S|5.0|Film works great,very fast development! For those of us still using the old cameras this film comes in really handy.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|You know, I'm not sure if I am the right person to ask an opinion of this group. I am of the opinion that The Bee Gee's are incomparable. I have been a Bee Gee addict for many, many years and I grieve for the tragedies this group has experienced. I LOVE them and will always enjoy their amazing style. I am SO biased!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a collection of interviews which gathers stories from individuals who survived the war between zombies and humans. The interviews bogged down in a few places, but overall kept me highly interested. Brooks is an excellent writer and I'll look for more of his work based on his skills with story-telling and dialogue/narrative. Haven't seen the movie yet, but I plan to.
B009NQZVKG|2.0|I was disappointed with this installment.  Topic was interesting but the characters that were killed off and the one being highlighted is just disappointing to me.  I have no interest in Seichan.  And Kowalski is completely underutilized as is Monk.  Seems the author (as happens frequently with storylines involving a core group) has become bored with his characters.  Very sad development.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I was about to purchase the britax organizer and my wife found this one. I was glad she did so, because it is great. It is way better quality than what I expected. Has some steel wire as frame on one side. Good product.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is fantastic!  It is really large.  It comes with extra inflatable toys.  My little one really seems to enjoy it.  I haven't tried hooking the hose up to it yet for the water to spray around the perimeter but so far I am really happy with this pool.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Critics evidently dismissed this movie as just another war flick. And perhaps it may seem such. However, for me, there seemed to be more substance here than the typical product of the Hollywood machine. Perhaps it partly due to Aaron Eckhart's acting, who plays a strong example of a man; of gentle strength, sacrifice, and leadership. Or perhaps it was the dignity with which humanity is treated. Amid total chaos and destruction, humanity is not lost; goodness, compassion, loyalty (as for example, when civilians die; the main characters actually show distress over the loss of life. Here, death is treated with more reverence than is typical in Hollywood. The main drama, in fact, revolves around the commander's apparent abandonment of his men).    Critics today seem to judge movies according to the measure of uniqueness. But greatness is not in doing what is different for different's sake, but rather, in doing was is familiar--what is tried and true--to perfection. Now *that* is unique!
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you're looking for the magic of Hogwarts, try a different book. However, if you're looking for the rich feel of complicated characters, beautiful settings, lifelike situations, and fantastic plot twists, look no further.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling writes about a secluded English country Parish in which the death of one man touches the lives of all in the town. We get to know almost all of the characters and find it hard to feel completely positive or negative towards a character with only a few exceptions, e,g, Obbo and Robbie. Rowling takes us around Pagford and through its events, moving from character to character as an impartial witness to the events of each character's life as well as inner monologue and feelings. Lush detail makes the book difficult to put down while still giving wiggle room for each individual reader's imagination and opinions towards the characters and the tiny village.<br /><br />While I picked it up for the author's name, due to trusting Jo to provide a great story, I came away with faith in the writer to cross genre boundaries, and tell quality stories no matter the subject. find your own feelings on the village life in Pagford, and enjoy your reading of The Casual Vacancy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really like the story and the cast! I like how things develop throughout the season. I like how they get around the various issues they have.
B004C3DLJS|1.0|I am glad I DID NOT buy Toy Story 3; instead I watched it on Prime.  The movie starts off so well, with most of the loveable characters from the first two movies heading into a new adventure.  But, about the last third of the movie is full of  violence, and the evil &#34;huggable&#34; purple bear goes on a psychotic rampage against Woody and the others.  It ruins an otherwise sweet, fun-loving movie.  I think Toy Story 2 is the best of the three movies, because it is about toys having an adventure, and the &#34;bad guy&#34; toy store owner is not trying to kill or maim anyone.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Wonderfully written and directed to capture the spirit of vintage Marvel comic books! The Loki/Hulk &#34;I am a God!&#34; scene has to be the most hilarious thing ever captured on film. Definitely a &#34;must see&#34; for any fan of superhero action/adventure movies.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie, based on a true story is intense, but it gives a very personal perspective on the aftermath of the horrible tsunami of 2004.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Excellent.  This álbum made me feel happy from day one and I often play it again whenever I want to enjoy myself. PSB are a rare combination of great dance vibes and unusually intelligent lyrics.
140006922X|1.0|Outrageous! Pure fiction. The author does NOT have a Phd in Religion or History, so even his credentials are fiction.  Mr. Aslan would do well to read Lee Stobel's \\"The Case For Christ\\" which gives true scholarly-founded proof via artifacts and documentation to support the life of Christ and the men who followed him, as well as the rapid growth of Christianity after His death. I would give this NO stars if that were possible.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  The story, acting, teachings.  It´s a movie about self discovery worth seeing for people of all ages.  We never stop learning (that is if we dare to learn).
140006922X|1.0|It amazes me that \\"The New York Times \\" says in their review that this book is a \\"fresh perspective\\" on Jesus.  One merely has to review a list of books on Amazon to see that what Mr. Aslan has done is neither fresh or radical but merely a rehashing of old theories about Jesus.  In his book \\"Jesus and the Zealots : A Study of the Political Factor in Primitive Christianity\\" the author a S. G. Brandon in 1967 arrives at the same conclusion.  \\"The New York Times\\" went on to say that Mr. Aslan had to \\"sift through centuries of mythmaking.\\"  Regrettably the only \\"mythmaking\\" was done by the author.  In the academic world in which Reza aslan lives  their is only one dictum \\"Publish or Perish.\\"  These so-called religious scholars simply \\"borrow' from each other.  Alas, anyone could say anything about Jesus.  Just because you have over 100 pages of citations from other books does not mean that what you are saying is true!  The \\"Times\\" needs to improve the quality of people who write these book reviews.  First, they should have at least taken a few courses in religion at their universities.  Second, maybe the \\"Times\\" should hire religious academics to analyze these so-called radical new books.  If you wish to kno more please read the 'Gospel Truth\\" by Graham Stanton.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I write this at 1AM because I couldn't stop reading it. Such an amazing man with a great story. A must read, and I'm not even a big military guy. A great story for everyone about how you can be a great guy and effect others.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I liked it at first but The only thing bad about it was adds kept popping up and Every time I hit it accidentally, it loads a long time. My 5 year old sis enjoys it but me not so much.
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|The cover says that Cécile is put on a straight line from Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. I think it is not a fair statement, at least not for now. However, it is obvious that this new (to me) singer has quality that will set footprints in the jazz community. Names like Lizz Wright and Cassandra Wilson comes up as references. The album really have some highlights that show great soul and interpretation. Cecile brings something new to the bandstand. It has soul, the blues and it swings and she gets great support from an excellent band. Let's hope that she gets the right support from the &#34;industry&#34;. If it continue like this start I think a new star is born.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This is a good game to keep young girls amused who are into fashion and hair styles. was for a four year old.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Wagner was a strange character and a lot has been said about his philosophy and ideas on humanism and politics. Whatever we think about that chapter of this persona, there is no doubt that he could write music to illustrate his views on a better world. To listen to a Wagner opera takes sometimes 5-6 hours so it is not so easy to get a view on his music. But Kaufmann Wagner is the way to do it. Here are some excerpts from Wagner's operas that are some of the most beautiful music I ever heard. Kaufmann is one of the reasons of course, but Wagner could really pen some real nice harmonies. When listening to this music I only see beautiful images. And I get goose bumps all over my skin. That means that it is really good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone loves playing this game. good for any age too. Even the little ones can do it. Good for car rides.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It was not what I expected it to be.  I don't like to read too much about a book before I read it.  I don't want too much influence to impair my own judgment.  It was like it couldn't choose what direction it wanted to take.  Fairies, witches,  and others.  It was just odd to me.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A very unique world and great story. Once I started reading it I could not set it down.I am half way through book 2 and still not getting any sleep.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good Book There Is No Way I Could Write That's Much About It I Would Read It Again Love It
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Being a bad speller I'm always needing to look up a word, or while reading I run across a word that I don't know and want to find out it means.  Very handy to have a dictionary at my finger tips!
B004SBX112|5.0|Just Fun Fun Fun. Very addictive. I can't stop playing it. Would recomend to a friend that likes games.Its fun!
B009O07NMA|5.0|Great price, great music, great piece of music with great service!  A must have for your collection!  Love ordering from Amazon as the price is always the best and you can count on their service.

B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This app keeps crashing. I have tired to open it a few times and every time it crashed. I wouldn't recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has to be the most sophomoric dirty book I ever forced myself to read the first five chapters and then the last just to see if it continued as expected.  It did.  If you want to read pornography try to find something that is more of a classic.  Otherwise, you have been warned!
193700788X|5.0|Whereas I have once in a while found the multiple bodily injury Sookie sustains throught the series a little &#34;much&#34;, I still think this is the best, freshest, most well-written, of series containing &#34;supes&#34; (supernatural beings.) I must give credit where due to the inimitable Anne Rice when it comes to Matters Vampire, but Charlaine Harris takes it all to a remarkably fun and entertaining level. I could probably read some of the books again just for fun, I liked them that much. Each one is a very fast read, so be prepared to go through the series in short order if you are taken with Sookie as I was.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|Got this to get started on lighting. It was very good, many examples showing the pictures and how the set was prepared too.<br />I liked it very much.
B00DHNBY02|5.0|Best horror movie I have seen in awhile.<br />Did not try to be an exact copy of original but had bits from it
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Not knowing a lot of North Korea before reading this book, I often felt more like I was reading a captivating story of post-apocalyptic fiction as opposed to a vivid journalistic account of the tragic and inspiring life stories of ordinary North Koreans.  I often struggled between my urge to keep reading with the need for an emotional break after reading a particularly sad chapter.  A story that needs to be told and read by more.
B00319KS7C|5.0|This is the best thing I have ever seen Matt Damon do and it is very rewatchable and quietly comfortingly entertaining.  What in the world was going on with Lysine and what were the Germans and Japanese doing with it???
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a game were you run from the cops a nd collect coins. Updates come out pretty fast but usually the new features have glitches. For instance in the version I have just added suits to some characters. The suits seem to have lines all over the suit but Jake's suits do not have the glitch. . They have a cool way for you earn coins without picking them up in the game. You can complete mission to earn coins and every time you complete a set o missions you upper your score multiplier. Overall this game is one of my favorites and you should get it. Please click the yes button bellow so I can know that my review has helped you.<br />Thank you -Michael

B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game. not too easy or too difficult. I have enjoyed it and would recommend it. I very rarely give 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun and I can barely stop playing it. It's fun for all ages
B005HEVBGG|5.0|If you are a Trekkie, this is one series you must see! Of course, this show is lead by a female captain who's crew and ship gets flung 75,000.00 light years from earth and they on a trek to get the crew of voyager home. And of course, along the way home, they meet different new species and new adventures. Definitely, one of my favorite show!
B00DU73T08|4.0|We rented this movie to watch with my sister and we all enjoyed it.  I was wondering how my husband would feel about it since it looks like it is aimed at the younger crowd; also, he didn't like Twilight.  But he did like this movie and he didn't fall asleep during it!
B00139XTG4|1.0|This book is very difficult to read.  The author could have said the same thing in simpler language in 10 pages.  He is betting on the highly improbable, totally unexpected, unplanned event which completely changes the circumstances of daily life.  He is betting on a very long shot and he keep betting small amounts over and over even though he keep losing.  Then after lots of small loses, he finally wins very big.  It would take nerves of steel to invest money this way.
B005LAII94|5.0|I got this movie for a great price. It was brand new which made it even better. I will defiantly order more
B005544TRQ|5.0|We like this show a lot.  Kind of Boston Legal-ish, though not quite as smart and current.  Weird aside.....an inordinate number of actors on the show have warts and moles on their faces!  Hmmmm.
B001F12J48|5.0|They kids loved wearing the little paper 3D glasses.  The movie is so great, we also purchased an updated version!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so romantic and incredibly tragic. I can't wait for the release of season 4! I only wish that it had more happy scenes.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Makes you realize that the things we should fight for in this country take time, commitment and yes, a little ingenious (and sometimes underhanded) prodding of those who cannot see that equality, justice and fairness demand change.  Proud of our American commitment to look critically at what is accepted as the &#34;norm&#34; which turns out to be totally against our basic foundations.
B0042HOU6W|5.0|i didnt have any commend of this product .if i got any thing to say wiill let u know it soon ..
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I came across this series by accident one weekend when they were playing the whole first season back to back on a cable channel.  After watching the pilot episode i was hooked!  I couldn't stop watching and went through the whole season in a couple days.  Within a month i had seen all the seasons up to the end.  Great acting, writing, music, backdrop settings, ......everything!  I'm so glad i can re-watch it at my leisure on Amazon Prime!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is a great show! Looking to get addicted to a new series? This one only has a couple seasons and is really entertaining!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It's definitely a good book to read, although I have to say that Hosseini's other 2 books that I've read - The kite runner & A thousand suns are the best I've read in many years. He is certainly a classic writer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is a good app and minions are adorable. it is kinda hard but my kindle lags sometimes and that is prob the issue
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game was terrible. Although it does sk as promised, it does the very minimum and does not do much. it is very dissapointing. get the toca boca game. so much better.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|This is a good book and reasonably priced for the info.  Author has nice writing style and gives you practical solutions for getting your focus and &#34;zing&#34; back.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I was not sure how much I would like it because apparently with each comic, there were clues leading into the avengers movie.  I did thoroughly enjoy it.  I believe it was the cast of characters that attracted my attention.  If there is a sequel, I will definitely see it as well.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Worst dictionary ever i hate this dictionary its the worst dictionary ever i really don't like this dictionary at all
B000W91RUG|4.0|It's so common for the first season of a sitcom to be sub-par (or not as good as most other seasons of the show) that people can practically expect it now. \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is a good example of this, although not taken to the extreme. It's not a particularly bad season of television, it's just that the show picked up later on in the second season and apparently had an even better third season (lots of which I don't think I've seen yet). Still, for people who like to start at the beginning, buying the season one DVD set is far from a waste of money; there are a number of good episodes in it. I'm not going to write about the plot that much. I'm sure almost everyone knows what it is, and that it's already been said before.<br /><br />Season one starts off with a pilot that is rather shaky and mediocre except for a couple of funny lines, like Leonard's cheesecake line. The season pretty much hits its stride after the first few episodes: \\"The Luminous Fish Effect,\\" one of the most well-written episodes, as well as \\"The Hamburger Postulate,\\" which I'd cite as the first episode showing that the show truly had potential. Coming up a little later is also \\"The Dumpling Paradox,\\" which remains arguably one of my favorite episodes of the entire show today.<br /><br />After an occasionally amazing first half, however, the second half season isn't as consistently witty. Examples include \\"The Loobenfeld Decay,\\" which has few real laughs, and \\"The Peanut Reaction,\\" in which the better of two plots gets less screen time than it should. The second half still has a couple of great episodes, like \\"The Nerdvana Annihilation,\\" (the famous episode in which everyone pays for an archival time machine) and those who like Leonard-Penny chemistry will likely be pleased by the last episode of the season, \\"The Tangerine Factor.\\"<br /><br />Overall, it's a good season of television, even if not the show's best. I would've liked to see some more DVD extras, as well.<br /><br />Best episodes:\\"The Dumpling Paradox\\" and \\"The Nerdvana Annihilation\\"<br /><br />Season grade: B
B001BXO1PK|4.0|This book is very much worth the price. I would reccomend it to anyone. Good examples and stories. Also many good examples to be practiced by the reader.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I thought the movie was a fairly faithful rendition of the book. The book was better, of course, but that's almost always true. I enjoyed it because I loved the book, I think. My husband, who had not read the book, thought that it dragged a bit and did not hang together as a coherent story. I thought the sense of struggle, amazement, wonder, fear, and gratitude came across pretty clearly. I would definitely recommend it if you read and liked the book. Perhaps less so if you haven't read it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Suggested book on my Kindle and I couldn't put it down.  If you like lots of twists and turns and suspense--this is a great summer read.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Great combination of puzzles and games; one of the best free games I ever played. Might even be worth it to buy for a nominal fee.
B0084BMUFA|2.0|This book is ok in some parts but in others too much info. If you like exciting books don't read this it isn't exciting. It is 2 pages per %, so really the book is 218 pages.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was one if the best movies in have watched in<br />Quite a while. I would recommend it to any one as a feel good movie

0345529057|5.0|During my morning and evening commutes these make my time fly by much faster. Since I am already ahead via the show, it's interesting to see how much of the book is true to the show. So far it has not been disappointing.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|i love the book and i love this version of the movie!  robert redford plays a great mysterious J. Gatsby.  this version is much better than the new one with Leonardo DiCaprio which is way over the top and has the wrong era of music.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|love this game! makes you think. graphics are great and even tho there is a timer its not too short to enjoy
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have mentioned before that I am not a fan of zombie fiction, zombie movies, zombies in any form. I will occasionally check out something that includes zombies as background, but I'm more interested in the effects of zombies and not the zombies themselves. After all, what's to like? That does not include The Walking Dead because the show and the graphic novel are more about how humans deal with a zombie apocalypse, and that brings me to World War Z by Max Brooks.<br /><br />Brooks's novel is about how people deal with zombies -- and so much more. World War Z is also about the world before the zombie apocalypse, which began in China, and what was going on in the world to make a zombie apocalypse possible. I still find some of the biology questionable, but at least one person in Brooks's novel had the same qualms I do and addressed them -- at least from his perspective.<br /><br />What I found so different and frankly astonishing about the novel was the way each oral history was handled. Each person's point of view took me from the initial outbreak and told me more about how the world worked and countries' secrets and zeitgeist than I could have discovered from reading hundreds of newspapers, magazines, and articles. World War Z is as much about the current world and its politics as about the breakdown of civilization and societies in the wake of a war in which there is no chance of detente or peace, only utter annihilation of the human race or surviving at any cost. The way in which many countries dealt with the zombie infestation was not pretty and did not evoke the gentler side of human nature, but survival instinct at its most desperate, leaving the question of how we retain our humanity with the end of all humanity in the balance.<br /><br />World War Z is astonishing and shocking and filled me with anger, surprise, and emotions that run the full gamut and I raced through the first 2/3 of the book, turning pages as fast as I could. Unfortunately, the down side to this emotional roller coaster was that it went on a bit too long. All the stories are fascinating and informative, but even a roller coaster should not last longer than the rider's ability to handle such emotional upheaval. At some point, you lose the ability to be afraid and satisfaction soon turns to a whine of \\"Are we done yet?\\" That one criticism aside, I highly recommend World War Z even for readers who don't care for zombie apocalypses and zombies in general. Max Brooks took me on a tour of the world I thought I knew and taught me more than I ever thought possible in the space of a book. A solid 4/5 stars, losing 1 star for going on a bit longer than I thought was necessary.o this emotional roller coaster was that it went on a bit too long.

B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Incredibly touching and beautifully performed roles. Especially touching that it is a true story. We really have no limits unless we believe we do.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good sound quality into a Sony PCM-M10 recorder.  The construction quality seems to be quite good.  My only complaint is the excessively long cable between the 3.5mm jack and the mic power supply (I'll probably shorten it by adding my own plug).<br /><br />Note the version being shipped has a 3-pole (stereo) 3.5mm plug despite the Amazon photo showing a 2-pole connector.  This will feed a mono signal to a stereo device.<br /><br />P.s. For those of you who complain about extremely low levels - MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE THE BATTERY INSTALLED IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game so much fun ! Love it. Keep s you very entertained fun for kids and adults you will be hooked I promise
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Well written. Very interesting reading. The world has changed dramatically since the period of time that this book covers.  It's a story of brilliant people doing amazing work and producing phenomenal aircraft.  I don't think these feats could be pulled off in today's world.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|Our physician recommended this to us and the book is very clear and gives great explanations for the science behind this kind of eating.  Already losing weight!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Put aside that some of the acting is abysmally bad and that the story lines are pretty cliche. The show is beautifully filmed and set and has a quaint and nostalgic sensibility that makes it priceless. I don't doubt that it jumps the shark in Season 4.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Easy to read the numbers and filled the requirements that I wanted to use it for on a daily basis.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I am not a Katy Perry fan.  I am impartial to her music, I dont hate it, I dont absolutely love it...I think its good.  But this movie was great.  It had emotion, it showed a side of her that I think you would know was there.  I was very impressed.  I think if you at all kind of like her music you should watch this movie.  It's good.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is a great movie that has stood the test of time..still makes me laugh!  Reminds me of when high school pranks were fun and innocent!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is good stress free fun, and i am a hopeless addict when it comes to any kind of rpg game! i had no problem downloading it onto my kindle fire., and it has provided me with HOURS of mindless enjoyment! (I was playing it while on vacation , and on the road). My only problem is being able to play it without being bothered by my loving husband!

B008602KQI|4.0|Movie is entertaining and well done, but initially confusing.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good movie and I woul watch it again.
B00795P4EG|5.0|After trying this app out, I would have paid $10 for it. There is nothing out there quite like this that is free.  After watching the tutorial, I thought there was no way the app would do what was said. It does! I have removed unwanted shadows, flaws off of faces/skin, and items off of pictures. You would never guess the photos were altered. I was able to remove headphones from my ears on a picture I loved of me on the beach!  I have long blond hair and my skin was tan at the time - you cannot tell that the headphones were ever there. The only negative is that if the item you want to take out is on a wild or multicolored background, it doesn't always work. But how often do we take pics like that?
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Very fun and entertaining. We love it. My kids want to take him to school. But I told them no.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|When I read the reviews for the movie, nearly all of them said: &#34;Go read the book!!&#34;<br />Indeed I read the book, and was not disappointed.<br />The book is surprisingly full of hope and has some great ideas. Being from Israel I was very pleased with the Israel sections.<br />Highly reccomended
140006922X|1.0|This book is simply the author's biased opinion of Christianity as a whole. Trying to explain how \\"The church, and especially Paul changed the essence of true Christianity\\" and who Jesus was. The Gospels speak for themselves my friend! Christians believe in who Jesus was because of who He claimed He was. Muslims have recently claimed that The bible we have today is corrupted, well this claim contradicts Muhammad's belief that there is no corruption of the scriptures as stated in The Qur'an. As well, thousands of recently found copies of the dead sea scrolls confirm the Bible, especially The New Testament's authenticity and claims, making the muslim attack on The True Word of God an embarrassing and sorry attempt by todays Islam.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love the John Corey series but found this story line a little laborious. It had a satisfactory ending but on the way there it was a little slow.

B002RSDW80|3.0|Not quite as good as I had expected but ok for the price. This was the first time I had watched this movie.
B00340LM8C|5.0|A classic Hitchcock film, To Catch A Thief is a sexy movie that sizzles with adventures and chemistry between its two leads. Grant once said Grace Kelly was his favorite co-star he ever worked with in films.<br /><br />This movie is fast-paced, filled with Grant's trademark wit and banter, and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous as the woman who falls for Grant's irresistable charm.<br /><br />A sure-fire classic that's guaranteed to entertain!
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|I really thought this movie would be funny. The humor came in small doses and was surrounded by so many F-bombs that the movie was completely unenjoyable. It's sad, because this movie had a lot of potential. I can handle vulgar language easily, but this was simply too much and seemed to serve as punchlines. :-\ I should have looked into that before we rented it.
B00CWVGNS8|4.0|Story about a man who lost the love of his life, begins to circle the drain and is shown how to live again by an unexpected person. Good plot, good actors and a decent film overall.
0143034901|4.0|Since I am addicted to books and love reading about stories that revolve in some way around books, I thought that this was great. At points it was a bit slow for my liking, but overall it had a good plot/interesting story line. This book may not be for everyone, but at the end of the day, I am glad that I read it.
B001DCQIAK|5.0|I have been listening to the 4-6 Tchaikovsky symphonies in my car since the recording was delivered a few weeks ago<br />  The music is so beautiful and the quality of the CD's superb.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. I love the little minions everywhere. I only wish you could get more tokens quicker without having to purchase them. Oh well. :)
067144901X|5.0|When my daughter was 6 months old she could not get enough of this book! We read it every night before bed.  This is one of the books I always buy my friends who are having babies.  The words have a great rhythm that is catchy for young ones and it is a way to have fun with animal sounds.  Definitely recommend this children's book!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is simple but so much fun! People who enjoy puzzles will definitely love this one - not too hard, not too easy; makes you think, but never frustrating. I don't even consider the absence of earning points or stars after each level to be a downside, because making the ball correctly is its own reward! The only possible negative I can come up with is that the 44 levels go by so fast. For the love of god, add more levels! I must have more levels!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is very fun ,and really easy to play.but some are a little more challenging then the others . But the game is worth everything .
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Although The Swerve purports to show how the past predicted the way things happened in current times, I was enlightened to learn of the corruption of society in the fifteenth and prior centuries,-socially, economically and especially religiously. Lucretius vision in the late years before the Common Era was impressive.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Movie had a nice surprise in the theme and had enough action.  I think this was not rated well, but for home rental, it was good entertainment for the night.

B00006IM9Q|5.0|This CD of Blondie's greatest hits is perfect for their fans! Band members have come and gone but their music has always been excellent--just one listen to this album proves it. Blondie does these numbers with lots of energy and the band never misses a beat! The songs may not be in chronological order; but this doesn't detract from the high quality control type of music on this album. There's something for practically anyone here simply because the band has been so versatile over the years; they have a remarkable wide-ranging mixture of musical styles that have made them quite a unique band! Listen for the reggae sounding \\"The Tide Is High\\" which made the airwaves sizzle; \\"Call Me\\" which sounds so good even all these years later--and what a pulse this has! \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"One Way or Another\\" are also very well done; and I really like other numbers including their huge hit \\"Heart of Glass;\\" the awesome \\"Rapture;\\" \\"X Offender\\" that uses key modulations very well; \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" that I really like; \\"Rip Her to Shreds\\" with that music fitting in perfectly with the vocals; \\"Atomic\\" which was a hit for the band; \\"Picture This\\" that impresses me and always makes me want to dance;  \\"In the Flesh;\\" \\"Denis\\" that again showcases their talent as they cover this song flawlessly; \\"(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence Dear;\\" \\"Union City Blue\\" that has Blondie performing at their usual very best; \\"The Hardest Part\\" with that rockin' sound; \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" which is easy on the ear; \\"Sunday Girl\\" and the final track, \\"Maria.\\"<br /><br />Blondie has shared so much of their talent over the years and that's special. I highly recommend their incredible music. You can't go wrong with this album!

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Having previously read Reza Aslan's work, and knowing something about his background as a scholar of religion, I confess that I am disappointed in this offering.  I like his writing style, which is at times gripping. Unfortunately, writing style also needs to be balanced with historical accuracy when attempting to write a biography. In this case, sadly, Dr. Aslan misses badly.<br /><br />To be fair, I have absolutely no problem with a Muslim writing a book about Christianity's origins - there are plenty of Christian scholars who write about the origins of Islam. It's just that I wish he had been a bit less obviously biased in his research. This is what unfortunately drags the book down.<br /><br />My message to all the Christians out there who are seething with anger at this book is this - \\"Relax, Jesus doesn't need you to defend him.  If he did, we'd all be in trouble!\\"  Similarly though, my message to others who seem enthralled with the book is this - \\"Don't believe everything you read, even if the author has a PhD.\\"<br /><br />In short, let's all stay off the \\"Christianity-bashing bandwagon\\" and the \\"Islam-bashing bandwagon\\". Instead, please let me encourage us to simply read the New Testament and the Qur'an for ourselves and make our own judgements about faith. There's plenty of firsthand biographical information in both sources to make sound judgements. If more of us did that, there would be a lot more hope for constructive dialogue and positive change on the religion front.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|The app itself is a great idea. My daughters looooove it. My complaint is every time or almost every time I purechase gems there are problems. Twice I paid for the gems the money was taken from my account yet no gems were ever received. Customer service refunded me once and advised that refunds are not normally given apps. On a smaller scale I would like to be able to see all of my horses together if possible. Other than this the app is a good.
1591844096|5.0|This fantastic book, a declared American best-seller, merges together many methods and messages. Everyone knows Seth Godin and his life philosophy is everywhere to be found, from the web to the media. Many reviews have been written so I would like to review this book, that I enormously enjoyed, in a slightly different perspective.<br /><br />First it is a book of its times. It would have never been written probably if America and the world hadn't gone through the recent economical crisis. The crisis in itself is the principle reason I think for the re-evaluation of the meaning of creative work. The competitiveness of working market pushes people to differentiate themselves as to their peculiar and special talents, or to the energy and the creativity they put into old and a little worn out patterns. If you have to survive, Godin is telling us, you must differentiate yourself from others. And how can you do this, only relying on your individuality and you own personal charismas. After ages of homologation (and here we have a definitive criticism of Marxist and communist culture) there is a return to individualism, but individualism American style, individualism that is absolutely compliant with societal work requirements. Nothing like Chris Guillebeau's The Art of non Conformity (which is also very fun to read), where it's the world that must come looking for you, while you are doing \\"your thing\\".<br /><br />To start believing in yourself and your talents, which are defined as Art, you have to overcome resistance, which is delightfully designed as \\"your lizard brain\\", even if at a neuropsychological level the identification of resistance with the amygdala is  not completely sure yet. This chapter is one of the most convincing and inspiring of the book, really a gem!<br /><br />Follows the culture of gifts. Also this concept is elaborated from the basic Hebrew-Christian values that represent the foundation of our culture. There is a very famous Italian poet not well known in the USA, Gabriele D'Annunzio that wrote a verse: \\"Io ho quell che ho donato\\". I have only what I gave away. That in a way resumes the idea that our treasures will be in heaven according to the Gospels. Your art must be a gift, because only from a gift you can acquire that extra-value that somehow, even if this somehow is not so clear but relies only on the faith that it will happen, or on the concept of  positive sum games, will make your work more satisfying if not more productive and appreciated.<br /><br />To get on with life change of being a linchpin one must design map (do a little programming) but this is often impossible, because many of these work patterns are new and have not been institutionalized yet. This chapter on map drawing is very short, but I am sure that in a future work Godin will have something to say about it, like today he analyzes the reason of success of many people.<br /><br />Godin seems to be inspired by the Asian culture and especially Zen. But if you read the book carefully what at least stemmed out for me was the rereading of our evangelical biblical roots in a non transcendental fashion. For example the leader as a server of his group is typically evident in the Gospels when Jesus washes the apostles feet!<br /><br />The bibliography is very down to the point and important texts are cited. The style is fluent and it is difficult to put the book down. The reasons for its success are all there and it is anthropologically a very interesting experience.own in the USA, Gabriele D'Annunzio that wrote a verse: \\"Io ho quell che ho donato\\".

B001U887VU|5.0|I love these so much that I plan to buy a new pair every winter.  They are warm hugs on cold winter evenings.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin digs deeper into the background and story line of every character.  Even after watching the series through season 3, reading A Clash of Kings has locked my interest in how Martin will unwrap the story line.  Great read.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The magnet is freaking solid, so I'm not scared to lose this little thing.<br />All good, Works.<br />That is it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed the game and so do my adult patients! Requires logical thought and memory skill to accomplish the goal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this series! Everyone needs to read them at least once. It has a part for everyone. If you love thrill, you'll definitely be in suspense at a lot of points! If you like love stories this is for you too! If you like action this is totally for you!! GO GET THIS BOOK!!! :D
B0012GMW34|5.0|At $3.99 current price with free auto-rip this CD is an incredible bargain. John McLaughlin may be the best living guitarist - he's certainly the fastest! - and Carlos Santana makes an excellent sparring partner. As my metaphor suggests this CD is somewhat of a guitar duel between two great soloists whose styles complement each other. Santana's licks are not as flashy but have searing intensity, while McLaughlin dazzles with incredible runs. All that is superstructure and would mean little were it not for an excellent foundation of melodic compositions such as John Coltrane's A Love Supreme. The over-arching theme of spirituality and one-ness gives a nice earnestness to the frenetic music-making. The supporting cast is great - in particular the outstanding drummer Billy Cobham, whose non-stop pyrotechnics do for this group what Elvin Jones did for the Coltrane quartet.<br /><br />At its best fusion is ear-catchingly virtuosic but this set is also melodic and memorable and a chapter in the history of two giants of the electric guitar.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really good Bible app! It has a really easy to use, quick search thing too! If you only want to get one Bible app, I'd recommend this one!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have been searching for a long time for awesome headphones that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  My search is done, I just need to order a new cushion since everyone says I will want to eventually ... replace the crumbling stock earmuffs.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Loved this book!!! It's one of my favorites actually! In case heavy swearing disturbs you don't read, but if you don't mind it and you love nerdy, geeky, cute, amazing love/romance stories, this ones for you!! ; )
0765325950|4.0|Great end, although somewhat predictable. We don't like evil to ever triumph but must exist, as the flip side of good, so therefore, can't be destroyed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a search engine for everything/anything so if you like hair, clothes, cooking/baking, nails, cars, tattoos, really anything, this is for you! It brings you straight to the website to purchase, give more info, or DIY instructions on the item. It's an app perfect for everyone!!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I found this to be a collection of short stories that were very loossly woven.  I never felt &#34;a part of this book&#34; as there was no strong on-going story. The first 2 books were awesome.  Not this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is an awesome app. Even my dad can't stop playing it . This game is greAt for any ages. I also love the angry birds toons. And if you love angry birds get ready for the angry birds movie . Smashing your aT into theater July 1 2016
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book was dope. Really sad that I have to wait for the next one to come out.<br />Peace out.
B006C1DH92|3.0|Puss in boots fruit ninja is an ok game.if your a fan of fruit ninja and the movie Prussian pots then you'll like the game to me the original fruit ninja is better.but if you like puss in boots and fruit ninja....... then you'll like this game
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this read. Although different from his two prior books it is still a good choice. It leaves you wanting to continue to follow the characters lives and anxiously awaiting a fourth book. It is not similar to his previous work but still worth your time. Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Let me just say..... I'd you love despicable me and subway surfers then you have to love despicable me minion rush. I have been dying to play this game ever since it came out. Minion rush is a great fame for All ages
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game and the graphics are amazing for a tablet love it it's campaign is a good one to its challenging
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a very good game, but the issue that I'm having with is the third form of in-game currency. Not everybody HAS to have a GL live account or Facebook. Indeed, Facebook is popular, but social networking should NEVER be a requirement in order to get their favorite characters. Forcing people to be social in order to get what they want? Not the best idea for MLP fans should experience. Just because Facebook is popular does NOT mean everybody HAS to have it. Making people join Facebook to get characters like Scootaloo or Zecora is probably the most forceful tactic anybody would do. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but using earning hearts by connecting to get people online, it's like taking an enlistee in training camp at the army and throwing him straight into combat. Geting on a social networking site in desperation to get their favorite ponies isn't exactly a kids game. Thanks alot gameloft, for hurting the children's chances to get their favorite characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It maintained the tempo of the series yet stood on it's own as a single book. Would recommend this book.
B003MXEGCK|4.0|Will Smith was actually funny! However, if you are expecting it to be anything like the book - you will be disappointed. :)
B0082Z447U|5.0|Excellent book. Perfect story. Amazon did a great thing by making this book available on as a free ebook on the kindle. Love it.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. I expected it to be &#34;too over the top&#34; but it was not. Great stuff!
B009ZE27US|1.0|this does not work and is a waste of space and you should not dowload it does not even tell a close age
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I like this book because it gives you information about everything. I could use this for school when I need a dictionary.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I've been reading the Martian books by Edgar Rice Burroughs since I was 15. I kept hoping for a Princess of Mars movie to be made. Finally, in my lifetime, John Carter made it to the big screen, and in 3D. Sure, the script deviated from the novels, but it kept the spirit of what<br />Burroughs wrote. This movie could only be made today with the digital special effects. Looking at it as just a movie, I thought it was fantastic. It had action, suspense, humor, and romance. I feel let down that Disney will not be doing two more sequels. What a shame.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|First the bad. Unlike most Gresham novels, he admits that he didn't do any research in framing up this novel, instead relying on his previously gained (extensive) knowledge. Early in the book, he names all the Federal judges who have been murdered while in office, and I know one of them (David Vance of Alabama) so I know he did at least a little. Instead he let the plot and characters play out.<br /><br />I could have missed it, but he seems to not have introduced his 'fall guy' earlier in the novel, so when he's introduced, he seems kind of a convenience character.<br /><br />Even so, this story is a typical Gresham page turner, easy to follow, hard to put down, and well worth your investment of a few bucks.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app is adware.  It collects your device information and email address adding you to their networks spam lists.  I'm only giving it one star because it won't let me give it zero.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|O.K... I'm a nerd! This book kept me tuned in throughout every page. The technical stuff was interesting, and not too technical; I don't know how accurate it was, but still fascinating. The story, itself, pulled me in, rooting for the main character as if he was real. At the end, I found my emotional response was like I was watching it unfold on the TV news.  This was a fantastic trip!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|There are so many choices of tools. I also have SketchBook Pro and Sketch Guru. It is easy  to have great results.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Pretty average watch.  The strap is not very durable--not meant for an active person, and i can tell it will need replacing soon.  I can't believe this watch retails for $185.  It is of the order of a cheaper strap watch such as Fossil, etc.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Was in said condition and worked fine.  My sister finally has a copy of this movie and she loved it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Typical action movie, but enjoyed the slightly different storyline and all of the special effects/action. Don't like Tom Cruise, but for some reason I enjoy his movies.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Arrived in great condition and I'm currently watching, with no problems.  Glad that I can finally continue the series with Sam and Dean.
0143124544|5.0|Me Before You<br />JoJo Moyes<br />Pamela Dorman Books/Viking, Jul 30 2013<br />ISBN: 9780143124542<br /><br />After working at the local caf&eacute; for six years, twenty-something Louisa Clark comes home depressed as she informs her parents the owner Frank shut the place down giving her no notice.  Her boyfriend Patrick tries to be supportive and offers to pay for their vacation.  At the Jobseeker's Office to get her first allowance, Lou learns how limited her skills are until the worker Syed mentions the care assistant position feeding and caring (but no butt wiping) for a quadriplegic during daytime hours.<br /><br />Will Traynor loved the thrill of closing out a multimillion dollar business deal.  He also relished the adrenalin rush he received from mountain climbing and sky diving.  Finally he had his choice of any woman he desired.  All that ended when he suffered a spinal cord trauma that left him filled with rage and frustration.  He believes his mom's new employee is a twit who he would never have noticed before he became wheelchair bound.  Filled with anger and morbidly depressed at his helplessness, Will lashes out at sweet Lou; but soon admires her refusal to quit though he rationalizes she needs the money.  When Lou concludes that Will plans to commit suicide, she desperately tries to prove to him he can still have a wonderful life while she also looks closely at her settling for a bland existence.<br /><br />Although the underlying premise is not new, Me Before You is a profound relationship drama with an underlying message to readers to live life fearless and to the fullest.  Character driven by the protagonists and with a super support cast, fans will appreciate this pathos tale filled with humor and anguish.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0058O84G0|5.0|Its an interesting book revolving around different personalities, different nations...a good mix of history with fiction. Some of the characters have been portrayed very well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes some good reading.  I read it on my Kindle and loved it.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|Too drawn out. Some issues not resolved. Quite a good read, but I was vaguely disappointed . one can always tell when someone else tries to complete a series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent story, beautiful to look at. Enjoyed all of the seasons so far and look forward to more. Enjoy this series.
1577314808|5.0|If you don't get it, then you don't get... nothing more to write about it these books of Echart Tolle. Too good...
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|The kids and I were laughing out loud and having  marvelous time watching the entire series. We have watched it over and over again and it still doesn't get old!
B005898CFI|5.0|Those are not stunt doubles catching the animals, those are the real actors, getting in and getting dirty - when the rino got loose, they had to capture it again ( one of the few places that they did voiceover work because Wayne was swearing ).
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Liked it and I am waiting for the next book in the series.  Very suitable for younger readers with no bad language.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and cool you can fight monsters and build stuff it is awesome check out the minecraft trailer for more information
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Ever since the newest update this Application has been truly amazing. With all new features and design this Application is like the iOS newest version with stickers for messaging, uploading photos in seconds and starting group chats quickly.  A MUST HAVE.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|It's a tough mission: being worthy of prequel-izing one of the world's best known films. Oz: The Great and Powerful accomplishes this by being... great... and powerful. An appropriate and compelling backstory that explains how the wicked witch became wicked is a highlight, as is the story of the wizard himself, and the story of the good witch too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Game is challenging to a a 8 year old especially at night.  Zombie's come out at night.  Also, like to join other games being played by others and play on their files.  Several of us have serious problems with out PocketinvEditor as they have quit working and need to updated.  My father and Grandfather are both very convernded about potential problems with viruses on the ocketinvEditor as both use their computers for their work.  I need to convince them that this action is safe.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|My cell phone came with the stock browser.  With the stock browser I can go to my bank site and check balances, transfer money between accounts etc. but what does not work on that browser is the \\"pop up\\" bill pay part of my bank account.  I have only used Dolphin on my cheap tablet, but so far I have no problems with the bill pay part of my bank site refusing to work.  I can access the bill pay on a laptop or a netbook but lets face it, the tablet is smaller and lighter and cheaper and I won't cry as hard if it's lost, damaged, or stolen.  It's rare that I'm away from home when the bills need paying but with this browser and my 9\\" tablet, I can do what I need to do at any access point.  So that's the first A+ for this product, it supports pop up windows properly that are in use on many banking sites.  The flash support and support for fancy HTML also seems to be superior to other android browsers. I like the initial page because you can setup places you go to a lot in buttons so you only have to touch it to go there, don't even have to look through a list of book marks.  The book marks and other options show up at the bottom when you press the rightmost button on android devices (looks like stacked boxes, the one you press to get to system settings).  Once the buttons popup you can hit the one on the left to make your bookmarks and history appear.  There are two different types of bookmarks you can choose which you want it to appear on, it's easy to add a bookmark you just press the plus sign to the right of the url window to add a bookmark where you tell it to add it. It also supports some sort of swype function that lets you assign a squiggle to a specific program, I haven't played with this, no idea how well it works.  This browser has the usual pop up blocking features and has an option to clean out the cache etc.  Only problem I've had with it was an app that refused to download properly, switched back to the stock browser and it came right down, no complaints.To be fair I've seen that before on an older phone, not all the browsers have the correct rights apparently to allow software to install and yes I know about the android settings that restrict downloads to the google store those are disabled.  For a free product this is a great browser, never had a pitch for a donation either and no adds.  If it wasn't too expensive I'd pay for it.
B009ME47H2|4.0|Unable to get to work as advertised.  Therefore, I nor my husband hadly ever use it.  If we would get it to work to record we would use daily since our hearing is failing.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen. It not only tells the story of a major battle of the civil war but also gives a view of the people involved and thier perspectives .
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Somewhat entertaining for adults; a better bet for a younger audience. Enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, Chiron. In fact, the whole movie was a good review of the Roman gods!
B000007UTN|5.0|I'm not the biggest Radiohead fan but I thought this could be a good addition to my vinyl collection and I was right!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Long winded with some interesting story lines but in the end, they were left with loose ends. I know Day said there'd be a fourth but nothing was resolved which left me feeling unsatisfied.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Loved the record! The album is amazing and it's amazing to listen to on Vinyl! Best record I've bought in a while.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|this app is fun but there are only two people u can style and it cost 10$ to unlock everything but overall fun!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really dislike the new upgrade. The previous version was efficient and effective, and presented information well. The new format is cartoon-ish, and requires more effort to get basic information. I used to visit the previous app every morning, and multiple times a day. This version, not so much. I'm seeking a good alternative now.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene Zschech is an amazing singer and writer.  Her songs are both uplifting and motivating while praising the Lord and touching the deepest parts of our heart.  I cannot say enough.  I wake up with these songs in my mind and on the tip of my tongue.  Revealing Jesus is the best live concert recording I have ever purchased as a Christian.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|haven't had time to play yet, but looks like it will be fun<br />only got it for being a freebie:)
140006922X|1.0|I don't have enough time to refute the fallacies in this book. Research the author - he is not who he says he is - Atheists may enjoy; otherwise, don't waste your time on this work from a so-called expert\\" in Christianity.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show.  At first, I was not blown away by the premise, but it works. Good cast and strong writing = great show.  Highly recommended.
B0094LU2TU|5.0|This is one of those &#34;signpost&#34; films - it's significant in being one of the first of it's kind that's unabashedly not US-focused (set in South Africa), filmed in a gritty, realistic, news footage / documentary style; and for focusing less on what the aliens are, where they came from, or why they are here, and more on the (relative to the preceding questions) mundane issue of literally what would people do with 1MM stranded alien refugees. Specifically, it focuses on how human society would almost assuredly do the wrong thing at every opportunity, while lying and covering up the truth. A sci-fi political drama. Plus the effects and action are top notch. Great stuff.<br /><br />More films are now spending less of the limited story telling time explaining how their particular sci-fi universe came to be the way it is, and more time focusing on a specific and compelling sub-story within that universe.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm so hooked on this game. I love it. I can't wait for more levels. Please don't make us wait long.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of the best series on cable TV. It has romance and every other emotion and challenge that can be put into one show. A+
B0092S4WLY|5.0|A lot of fun and challenging game. I am hooked. It's hard to walk away from. It's fun and you need to try it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When you play this game on an Aneroid phone there is another location and I want to play it on my Kindle too!!! Where is it why can't I get to it???? I would give this game the 5 stars it deserves if I could get to this level :(
B008220BP2|5.0|I love this movie!  Outstanding premise.  Excellent screenplay made from an amazing novel.  Great acting and a completely entrancing production.  Finally, Blu-ray is the way to go.  I have watched this a dozen times so far!
B00CU0UE0E|4.0|This is a great album and worth purchasing.  Tell your friends!  They did a great job.  Four more words required.
0321934318|5.0|This the finest book on light room 5 that I have ever seen.  I need seven more words  I just looked over the manual but not able to thourly give it a good review.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I loved Susan Boyle from the 1st time she was on America's Got Talent and I purchased all of her CDs. This is a favorite of mine and I recommend it if you have never heard of her.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|The epitome of 1980's Metal, fresh group teleported straight from the days of aquanet, spandex, and kick ass music!!! DEATH TO ALL BUT METAL!!!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Awesome puzzle game. Not ridiculously hard yet still challenging. Makes you pause and think. Not a button mashing game.  Music is cool but you can turn it off if it's not your thing.  I definitely want more levels.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Recently got introduced to Steel Panther at the M3 festival, and they are AWESOME! Well worth the money. They degrade women, talk about doing drugs, and doing multiple women at one time....Everything 80's metal was and still is!!!
B009SH5JS4|5.0|This is my second favorite rom com of all time, after Roman Holiday, but the DVD version was so poor looking on our HDTV that we had stopped watching it, so I am glad they came out with a Blu Ray. I know the movie is nearly 20 years old, and we aren't taking about Lawrence of Arabia here, so I didn't expect any special features, which is good... because there aren't. ANY. Just a trailer. I would really have enjoyed a commentary with Kline and or Ryan. Some 'making of' footage showing the beautiful locations, etc. Oh well, as I said, didn't expect anything, so I'm not let down, just wishing for another release, maybe.<br /><br />The picture was flawless in 1080p. Sound was good, but as another reviewer mentioned, it was a little quiet. It was no problem to turn it up, but this is something they should have caught before sending this to production.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Says it's in my kindle but where that's what I'd like to know. I've downloaded loads of games no problem but this one and arcade challenge are nowhere to be found
B004GYY714|5.0|This is the best radio that I know, I just have my favorite music playing all day long, never got tired. Love it !!!!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very entertaining story line, remarkably similar to S. King's 'Under the Dome'. My first Blake Crouch novel; I will be reading others by this author soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Most of these games get to a level and then start making absolutely no sense.  Even after using cheats you can't figure out the clue.  This one is very logical and just hard enough to keep you interested but not frustrate you to the point of giving up.  2 thumbs up.
B004EPZ034|5.0|This movie is so cute - perfect for my Grandsons, ages 2 and 6.  They loved it and even my husband and I enjoyed it!
B005544TRQ|3.0|Wow what some egos in this.  New levels which I've never really seen before.  The plot line is pretty good & is fun to watch.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Wonderful  Disney movie - never get tired of seeing this one - great for adults as well as kids! Beautifully restored.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter whether you like fiction or non-fiction, mysteries or love stories.  It is a very satisfying read.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|It's really so very good, there's not much else to say. If you want to watch a show that you become addicted to and really invested in, then this is it. It's great, can't wait until I can buy season three.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Did not find it very interesting. No charge was made so I suppose it was not too bad overall. Not a facebook member so no good to me.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Downloaded for my kids and they lost interest in about 30 mins. I thought it had some good info about the ocean though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Good game. Some very funny sections on it. Very varied games which made it interesting overall. Best so far as far as Angry Birds go
B000UVT3OI|5.0|holy cow its garth brooks how could it be anything but good. shipped fast, received fast and played it over and over. its the best of, whats not to like.
B002KGEORM|5.0|This had me hooked from the very first episode. The bad thing is now I want to buy a Harley, lol
B00D1DBO1C|5.0|What a great business calendar it help me to remember important appointments and to be well organized. Could not be better for me.
B009GED3HS|3.0|This season was OK, but I mean, come on. It needs to end. It's time has come. Thankfully we finally saw Ted's soon to be wife, but hopefully this next season they'll get marred, have kids & live happily ever after.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really a good idea to have as a game it is really fun you should try it and it is completely free. LOL
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I cut the cord & got rid of cable this year, but I had to still get my fix. Buying the season pass on amazon was the way to go. This season was good, & can't wait for the next one! (which I will be streaming from Amazon again :) ) My chemical engineer nerd husband likes it too !
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I watch the movie on Amazon Prime, It stream and play without any problems. It was very good movie and cant wait until the sequel to come out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been watching this show since the beginning, but since I cut the cord & got rid of cable this year, I had to still get my fix. Buying the season pass on amazon was the way to go. This season was amazing, & can't wait for the next one! (which I will be streaming from Amazon again :) )
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a super addictive game. As a self proclaimed \\" non gamer\\", Free Flow was extremely easy to learn. It is a perfect game for waiting rooms as you can start & stop rounds quickly.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Liked Bruce Wilis's other movies, but this was not as good as the previous ones.  Just a little weaker!  Most guys will like all the extra action though!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I discovered this series late (July 2013) and quickly caught up with all 3 season in only a few days.  It is so well written and the actors are simply amazing.<br /><br />Not to give anything away but I can't wait for season 4 as season 3 did not end well.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Look at this story and you can see yourself. Learn the lessons from those who' have gone before our time
B004TI1WME|1.0|This app was supposed to list item as you put them in and it didn't. In other words it wasn't any different than the other calculator apps I've tried.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Kevin Spacey is fantastic. Only he can pull this role off! Robin Wright is also perfectly casted. Great writing! Can't wait for the 2nd season.
B00A83075M|4.0|\\"We can't change who we are.\\"<br />The main character though, sets out to challenge that principle but in the end proves it by remaining a villain.....with a smile.  He is still regarded as and treated as a villain because that's his role in the game/life.  Exactly how is that promoting a positive message?  Instead, this movie sanctions just the opposite; you are what life designates but, hey, be happy with whatever is thrust upon you.  If a villain be a villain, but be a happy villain!  To that end, rebellious Ralph's main goal is to win a medal/acceptance.  Unfortunately, in the process of achieving that goal, he almost ruins everything for everyone else, forcing him to finally \\"fix it.\\"  (Ultimately, no one should have to prove their worth with a medal or an act of courage.  No one should have to fight for respect.)<br />Bewildering message aside, this was both a visual treat and a wild rush of an adventure.  If taken on that basis only, it's a fun film.  (I know nothing of the games they referenced throughout but it didn't make any difference: fun is fun.)
B001JI5DRC|5.0|EACH  TIME APOLLO 13 IS SHOWN I  SETTLE DOWN IN FRONT OF MY SET AND WATCH IT IN IT'S ENTIRETY...THIS IS A VERY RIVETING SUPREMELY AMERICAN MOVIE.  NO PEOPLE ON EARTH IN ANY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET COULD DO WHAT THE CREW OF APOLLO 13 DID DID....CONQUER SPACE ITSELF'.  WHAT A SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT  THOSE MEN ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THE ENTIRE APOLLO 13 COMMAND DID  STANDS FOREVER AS A TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT AMERICA TRULY IS THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF MAN.....!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this book a compelling read. It starts a little slow but later on you realize the slow start is integral to the story. Things moved quicker as you get into it. The resolution surprised me.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Incredible work by Mumford and Sons.  Great vocals, great instrumentals, no computer assistance just talent.  If you are thinking of buying this buy it.  Great album and I honestly can't wait to see what is in their next album.
B006O6F932|5.0|My 10 year old loves this and has had no problems with it.  She got it for Christmas and plays with it on a daily basis, and it is holding up great.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I haven't used this app much however the times I have used this application has been great.  Thanks for making it free.
B00BD62X14|5.0|very soothing and melodic.  well composed and written.  very mellow production from a normally rambunctious performer.  I heard her interviewed on NPR and bought this disc as a result and I am well pleased.
B00E7SID9G|3.0|Anyone who has read extensively about the historical Jesus will not find anything revolutionary here  -  yes, Mr Aslan, we all know that Jesus was a revolutionary. Perhaps, as a Muslim, Mr Aslan thought he was being daring with his assertions, but they are quite banal in the current world of New Testament analysis.<br /><br />If readers want to graduate onto something more challenging -  the identification of Jesus in the historical record - they should try 'Jesus, the King of Edessa'.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00DI9VZWM Jesus, King of Edessa (The King Jesus Trilogy - KDL Fire Edition)]]
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I am a giant fan of Sandra Bullock, but to know that those types of emotions and gut wrenching support still exist in today's world was very refreshing and enlightening. Kudos to the family for sharing their story. Family is not always a direct blood line.
140006922X|5.0|One thing I think is funny. Is that people believe, I mean honestly believe, that the bible is the only history of Jesus. I hate to break it to you, but the Romans had a far advanced method of keeping records of everything. Especially within their empire. And they spoke a language. You may know it as Latin.  To say that true historical references outside of the bible as to who Jesus was as a person is wrong at face value because it isn't the bible. Is asinine and ignorant. I was raised Christian. But I know that there is more to Jesus than simply what's in the bible. If you choose to be hard headed and not believe that. Well fine. But it's a fact.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not just for young adults! As a 26 year old, I could STILL completely relate to the characters. It's so incredibly written! A MUST READ!!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|This album is like being enveloped in a warm embrace from an old friend. Wow! I love this album. I didn't realize just how much I missed the BSB. I think \\"Breathe\\" is my favorite right now. That will probably change after I have listened to the album more and more.  Brian, Kevin, Howie, Nick and AJ seem to be at good places in their lives and it shines through in their singing. Welcome back BSB!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Absolutely love Dexter!  Wish it was going to last longer than one more season.  Sad all good things must come to an end.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|didn't like game i couldn't understand what to do couldn't find how to play don't like it and deleted it
B005IQ39AY|5.0|My newest favorite!!! When playing in the evening I get carried away and it makes me miss my bed time (smiling).
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Plasma Sky is a great game, very easy to get, addictive, best arcade app on my phone. Top notch in it's category.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It is great to have an app on my Kindle Fire for working when I am away from my computer.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I personally think it was great it was fun and creative! It's worth 1.00<br />I loved it and I hope u do it when you decide to buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first started this game I was surprised of how many cool things that were on there. And the coolest thing about it is that youalways get a update for free.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|EDIT: I will post pictures later on tomorrow.<br />EDIT#2: You must have an HDMI port on your T.V<br />EDIT #3: NEXTFLIX PROMOTION IS NOW OVER!!!!!<br />First I would like to ask who ordered it?<br />Okay so to start with my first impressions. So when I received the device, the packaging had a very clean style and overall very good looking. Now for those of you who don't know what this device is I'll tell you. It basically streams video from your computer to your T.V. With that being said it is like having your computer hooked up to your T.V via HDMI but wireless.<br /><br />My first impression was different than I thought, the first thing I realized is the dongle needed a power source at all times via its own AC adapter. This was not a deal breaker but I hoped it would have powered itself.(You can also use the usb power from your T.V's USB port) The dongle is very sleek, and seems pretty durable. The device did come with a HDMI extender which was optional, it says it is used to improve fit (as it might not fit behind all tv's) and improve Wi-Fi connection. I did not use it because it fit perfectly and it wasn't a tight fit. The device was very easy to set up, it took about 3-5 minutes. You had to download the chromecast app which helps you configure the settings for the device and connect it to your wifi, and it also downloaded the chromecast add-on. Overall very easy and fast to set up.<br /><br />To use the device it must be on the same network as you device you're streaming from. Once you have set up everything you are good to go, you can stream youtube, netfix, etc and any webpage directly to your tv wirelessly.<br /><br />This device works with Android phones and Tablets, iOS devices, iPhones, iPods, and iPads, it also works on OS X ( Mac )<br /><br />While using the device for a couple hours I noticed that the quality is amazing and, the delay is that bad considering I am sitting almost all the way across the house.<br /><br />I haven't even talked about theicing on the cake yet. Included with this purchase you get 3 free months of Netflix. How does this work? Well if you order it from amazon it gives you a 3 month code. Now if you add the Netflix, $8 a month for 3 months that is $24, and<br />the device only cost $35 you have only paid $11 for the device!!!<br /><br />My overall opinion is the device can only get better from here, I noticed going into the Chromecast app that the device had a firmware version, meaning all they can do now is upgrade and get better. I highly recommend getting this device as it has many positives and is worth the money you pay.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think this game is great for all kids!! It's easy to master and they aren't constantly trying to get you to buy something. This is a game where you can raise dragons, breed them, and become incredibly powerful. Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good game because jump stuff my big brother Jesse put the game on<br />And I love it
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|But you need to buy add  ons for variety. Advertisements keep popping up while the game is played.Most annoying!! Boring!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great books all I can say is more please!!! Cant wait for her next book to come out so excited!!!
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|You really don't need it but it makes the game more interesting.There are a few tips that are really helpful.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. It is great:):):):)! Who ever made it is great for making games! I love all of the games.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. No matter how many times I play it, it is never boring. I also like the levels.
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|This new recording is wonderful. As I read the numerous highly polarized reviews already posted I can only think: If you want to hear Norma the way you know it, like it, are used to it, well, play your own recording of it and be happy. If all you can say is it's not like Callas' recordings (and believe me, I worship Callas, I kneel in adoration at her feet, but let's move on) then there's a lot of potential enjoyment you're missing. If you're open to new perspectives, however, give this one a try. It is magnificent. The singing is tops, the tempi are coherent and logical, the original instrument timbres are crisp and satisfying. Thank you, Ms Bartoli, for scraping the old paint and barnacles off this masterpiece!
B00C0W08XK|3.0|It's ok.  Good for beginners just learning the game.  It is really slow play. Not challenging enough for people who know how to play.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This is an eye opening book about how we make choices. Best known for his work in behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, has written a book for the layman. Using examples from various tests and studies, he explains that there are all sorts of variables such as how something is phrased or appeals to the emotions that can make a bad decision seem logical. As you read through his exercises, you find yourself saying, \\"no, I'd never fall for that\\" and then in day to day life, you'd find that you were thinking exactly as he described.<br /><br />Warning, it is not a fast read like those written by Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, or Charles Duhigg. This has a lot of statistics, facts and figures included that shouldn't be overlooked. It took me almost a year to read and understand, but it was well worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The is a fun game that can be difficult at times.But challenging too as you progress thru the different levels
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up for the iPhone was easier than for our Acer laptop.  Once set up, the picture quality is very good.  No more need to<br />expand the screen (youtubes, netflix videos) the dongle automatically provides full screen on your tv.<br /><br />You do have to click on the Chrome icon to get to netflix and youtube on our Acer, not so on the iPhone.<br /><br />We lucked out and bought the day it was announced which garnered us a 3 month free streaming of netflix ($23.97 value)<br />Looking forward to future apps, hopefully Amazon.com!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game, fun to play.  I like to attack others and invade their base.  It is fun to see how many coins you can get from invading other bases.
B0026772N8|5.0|I started to read this many years ago and stopped for some reason. Now I am very much into this book.<br /><br />Mike Powers
B002W7H3EA|5.0|They just don't make 'em like this anymore.  From start to finish, a rollercoaster ride of thrills and surprises.  Cary Grant was never better than Roger Thornhill.  Eva Marie Saint was no slouch either.  Add in James Mason and the venerable Martin Landau and you just can not lose.  Blue-Ray was nice.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|An interesting portrayal of a cool, calm and collected man hell bent on revenge to the n'th degree.  Good story line, built up a few surprises for the audience.
B00992CF6W|3.0|we need enderman cavesystems mobspwaners though other then that great game love it so amazing love it sooo muuuuch great game
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Even though this movie is listed as Horror, it's actually more of a comedy with the talented<br />Bruce Campbell. One of my all time favorite actors!!!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Great finally after all these years of reading this series, seeing the characters grow and evolve, it all comes to a head. When I started book 3, I said to a friend I hope I live long enough to read the last book. I forget how long since the first but must be over 10 years, sometimes having to wait months for the next one to be published. well done.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I want to be Harvey Spector when I grow up.  This is a great show and I am someone who doesn't really like lawyers.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Fun novelty game.  I played it 4 times with fairly obscure characters, and it actually managed to guess them all every time.  I was impressed.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|I love this movie!  One of my top 5 favorites.  Always brings me many smiles. I would watch this again.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Although this may not be the best movie in the world, it's got a good cast and a ton of good action scenes. I'm a HUGE Bruce Willis fan and the combination of him, an action-packed storyline AND Adrianne Palicki earned this movie 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. If you liked the first one or actually, even if you didn't, it's definitely worth your time to sit down and give it a look. *****---5 STARS!!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  the characters were well defined and the story was simple and delightful. Many life lessons to be learned.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I love the concept of the underdog prevails!  Captain America is a clear winner; a must see!  Great action that will have you rooting aloud in your seat!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Having seen the Tom Cruise led movie, I was drawn to the books, I read this and One Shot during couple of days of rain and was glad for it. At last a lead character that doesn't need to have doubts or a woman to take him away from what he knows he has to do. No second guessing and no ambiguity.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Suspenseful writing, creative storytelling, and relatable characters make this novel a fast read despite its length. I immediately bought the second book upon finishing this one.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|When Voyager first debuted with this episode, I missed it.  I went on to watch a number of seasons, but was never able to understand how it all started.  Now after watching this first episode, it all makes sense.  It was a great episode.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I decided to download this app as the FAOTD for my Kindle Fire.  For a calculator app, it does the job very well.  It's very simplistic and is pretty easy to use.  An especially good application to use if you have kids learning fractions in school.  Easy to use, and looks good on the Kindle Fire.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this app is fun to play on the rode or at the mall or waiting in line I recemend everyone to get it. its like temple run but funner.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This application is a must for the Kindle Fire if you plan on using it to view .pdf files.  I wish this was built into the Fire software because this application makes reading and searching .pdf files very easy.  This application really helps me with many of the .pdf workbooks I use for my job.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I love Pretty Little Liars! They are showing the 4th season now on TV. I just really want to know who Red Coat, -A, the -A Team. I want to know them all!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It was fun, still playing it and quite enjoy the campaign it offers. You start off with the Green deck, and go from there. Lots of customization options for the player profile. Don't buy anything other than the game, you can unlock everything. Great app for the Kindle. Peace, and get to playing already!
6305079811|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s then you'll LOVE IT!!!  Best movie ever... The kids will absolutely love it.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Movie was pretty good. Had a good twist to it. Would recommend to family and friends. Had me at the edge of my seat!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Despite having to install 3rd party drivers (SCP DS3 by Scarlet.Crush) it's an all around great device. Rechargeable, light, vibration is strong. After going through so many Logitech, Power A, and off brands for years, this is a nice and very welcome change. I just hope the joysticks can handle the beating I'm going to give them.
B000W9399S|3.0|It took a few pages to orient and acclimate myself to the strange contours, geography and characters of Discworld.  But once I arrived I was charmed and amused and captured by the adventure. It is worth expanding the imagination to go on this journey.  Fun book that gives you a very different perspective.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great adventure flick with a great story!  Characters are unbelievable  , great acting, and computer graphics work is flawless.  5 stars!  Worth the 2 hours
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone who became addicted to the Song of Ice and Fire series and misses his style of writing. This is definitely more science fiction vs fantasy, but an overall enjoyable book with interesting characters and a strong plot.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Very good adaptation of Burke's character Dave Robichaux, and the story from that novel.  If you are a fan of JLB you will enjoy this one better than &#34;Heaven's Prisoners&#34;.  If you are just looking for a good movie you won't be disappointed.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game that can be played over and over in a couple of different formats.  It is timed so there is always the challenge to beat your best time.
B008220AVW|4.0|I was never a huge fan of Katy Perry mainly because her music is EVERYWHERE but sometimes I find myself humming along to her tunes without even knowing it. That's what makes a good pop song. Another friend of mine mentioned they enjoyed this movie so I thought I would check it out. I was really entertained. This is not the story about some washed up, drug addled rock star that's full of drama but more about a girl's struggle to make it into the music business and a look into her rise to fame. Katy seems like a genuine entertainer who keeps herself grounded by staying connected to her family, friends, and fans. She loves what she does and isn't afraid to be herself. She brings fun everywhere she goes. If she keeps doing and stays humble and grounded throughout her career, she'll be around for many years to come. I'm looking forward to seeing what she comes up with next.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This is a challenge and is fun to see what you put together.  Sometimes it is difficult to get the pcs. where  you want them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. Can not stop playing. Fun for all ages. Want more levels as soon as possible. Only 10 levels...now what will I do?
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book starts off very slow, but quickly picks up the pace. You know its a good book when you find yourself not able to put it down and read it in a day. Good story line, great twists.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I really like her music. One of her  best albums. Was a present- what a nice surprise. Can recommand it
B000HKYOK0|5.0|While the uniforms are a bit outdated the stories are still great. I am enjoying tbe series all over again.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I was one of the unfortunate ones that came into this series well after it aired but OMG what an awesome series it is. I have watched it multiple times and have gotten my wife to watch it just recently and she is now addicted. I have also turned several friends onto the show that had never seen ti and they love it.<br /><br />It just goes to show how impressive this cast was/is considering most all of the actors have gone on to have good or great careers on other shows. Most impressive is Nathan Fillion. He is tough yet tender, the captain and the father and he pulls it all off with style.<br /><br />And Joss Whedon... I mean what is there to say about the man, the myth the legend?<br /><br />If you love this show recommend it to everyone, if you haven't seen it watch it, love it, than recommed it to others! This show deserves the following and it deserevs to come back in some form some day.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app for kindle but Samsung phone hard to scroll up and down on the hourly part of the app. Otherwise a good app
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I tried to download this game and after 4 days of slowly downloading it froze up at like 89% and that was it. every time I would try to click on the app or do anythign with it it would freeze up my Kindle fire.<br /><br />That said it sound awesome, I just wish it would have workd.
B00AZMFO6I|1.0|We eagerly awaited the release of this dvd because of Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut and the fine cast.  Much to our great disappointment it was a great disappointment.  Maggie Smith was outstanding as usual with what she had to work with but the movie was S-L-O-W and that's being kind.  It took more than half the movie to get to any point at all and by the time we reached that point we had dozed off several times.  Perfect for insomniacs because it's guaranteed to put you to sleep.  Even though it is about seniors and meant for our target audience, there were no redeeming values and most points were telegraphed far in advance of the point.  Save your money and buy a bad movie you can laugh at like &#34;The Legend of Boggy Creek&#34; that, up until now, was the worst one I ever saw.
B000OVLINI|4.0|It was fun.17 more words until I can submit this review. Read this book. It is entertaining to the end.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I started watching Suits because of my daughter... now I can't stop watching! It's interesting and sometimes funny! Just love it!
B008M721MS|5.0|This app is awesome. All you have to do is set up an account. It asks for personal information that you need. You have  to have a username and a password. After that, you have to press the button where it say  to &quot;add contact.&quot; When you have the contact you want, you can send messages, video chat, send videos and pictures, and many other things. It's all free but you have to pay for calling. There is many different things that you can do. I only had one problem adding the contact. Because it wouldn't let me send instant messages to my contact. Then I realized that you had to add the contact. I got that problem fixed. But it won't let me send videos. That stinks. But it does pictures fine. My contact ha  problems with hers but she has an iPad and a laptop but it works fin  on he  laptop not on her iPad. It's great. Note: can you please say yes when it asks of this review helps because I want to get a lot of people to like it. I did reviews for doodle jump for the 99&cent; version, nexus 7, funtastic camera, wacky world, and this one so far. Please like this review and please go on the others an  like those to. Thank you very much!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|complete junk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. LIKE I SAID JUNK. WORKED FOR A VERY, VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. JUNK. IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this more than any Disney game out. it is more self sufficient than the croods and the graphics are better.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr Grisham has a way with words that makes a reader get caught up in the story.  Always manages to keep one interested.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Te Darkness is back! Nearly every dong is a winner!<br />Buy this at all costs. You need it!!! Now oh now!
B005COO1X6|4.0|stephen king is my favorite author and has never written anything I did not like.  This was not his best work but still a good read.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Good. Moved along. Nice plot twists but somewhat predictable. Child always makes characters that seem real and likeable. Good read.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|I received this as a gift. So glad I didn't waste my own money on it. (At the risk of sounding like my parents) this isn't music. It's noise! The songs are not put together. It's all over the place nonsense coupled with screaming jargon. Phil has way too much talent and experience to be putting out albums like this. He sounds like an awkward virgin, fumbling his way around not sure what he's getting at. I've heard hardcore bands at high school talent shows that sound better than The Illegals. Phil, the next time you want to put your aggression into words, write a book.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|Love Chevy Chase! Funny Funny movie! I don't have anything else to say about this movie except watch it! You will love it!
B008PZZV8S|2.0|Not what I expected.  It as sort of dark and depressing.  He got deeper and deeper into trouble.  Downward spiral.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, the extras are great and funny. I will recommend to all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Great for anyone who's interested in military operations and US history in general.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Usually, I read for about a half hour when I am lying in bed at night, and then fall asleep.  When I read an Alice Munro short story, I finish the story, and keep thinking about it.  Munro provides lots of clues about her characters and the plot, but also leaves enough for the reader's imagination to wonder about the meaning of it all.  I love reading Munro, but I don't get as much sleep.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Its a lawyer show, but not so typical as it really is witty and more human than other show, but not so dramatic that you want to vomit watching it.  I got my husband into it and he's not normally a drama kinda guy.  Love it
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|We got this for our dad for Father's Day. He is literally obsesses with the eagles and he loves this DVD so much. Great gift for the die hard eagles fan.
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved the show my wife and i both watched the first season in one day, kinda wish it would have been a little longer :)
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Fast, easy to use, accurate informaion.<br />Fun app, enjoy using whenever possible<br />Would recommend to anyone drivers & passengers alike
1451626096|4.0|I loved the other 4 books in this collection- the Cousin's War.  This book I had high hopes for... and though I enjoyed reading it the story line about \\"the boy\\" went on too long.  I wanted to hear more of Elizabeth's life and let it end up to after her last child is born.  I was hoping the next installment would be a continuation of Elizabeth's life but it is going to be told from Maggie's view which means we will be rehearing the story of \\"the boy.\\"  Though \\"the boy\\" is an important part it is very focused on him and its disappointing how it plays out. I also wish she used more fact than fiction.  Anyway after all my complaining I still would recommend it.  There are some good parts that had me smile, laugh and cry!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very witty drama.  Great characters and plenty of plot twists.<br /><br />We're totally addicted and want to just watch them all in a row, but don't want it to end too soon.<br /><br />January 2014 for season 4 will be such a long wait...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME! It's where the policeman catches Ferris, doing graffiti. Then he decides the only way to get out of this is Going through the subway. I am glad that the game eats mostly VIRTUAL mine instead of real money! THABKS Kiloo&trade;!
0060594896|5.0|I had to own this book for all of the wonderful information it gave me and continues to give me. I am continuing to read and follow the suggestions that I feel apply to my life journey. A lot of the principles I have learned over the years, it is good to see them written down.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Surround sound good in parts of the movie.  Felt the plot could have been more exciting. Action scenes were good.
148951418X|5.0|Using the GoPro never really clicked till I read this book. Walked me through it from start to finish.<br /><br />Glad I found it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is perhaps the most balanced book about the chivalry of war that has been written.  Excellent from any prospective.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|My granddaughter loves this book. We read it sometimes 4 or 5 times a night and she often falls asleep while listening. I recommend this book highly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun!! I really like it a lot. My husband has it downloaded too. Everyone should download it.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Didn't quite make my list of books to suggest one of my friends to read, but still a good read.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have recommended this series by Jeffrey Archer to everyone I know that loves to read. I recently discovered Mr. Archer when i stumbled upon his first book in the Clifton Chronicle series and I have now read several his other books as well. I haven't read one of his books yet that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I believe he is one of the best storytellers around at the moment. However, the Clifton Chronicle series is one of the best series I have ever read. The books can stand alone on their own, but to get the most out of this series it is recommended to read them in their proper sequence. Do not hesitate to read this book, but make sure you read the two prior stories first. Enjoy the ride Mr. Archer takes you on with the life of Harry Clifton.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Her results are always great! I love this work out! Of course you have to give to get the results you want.  the results are promised are the results to get a d they are fantastic. It has transformed my body and it is great. I recommended for anybody!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I wish it would be just set up like the weather channel on my computer! I hate how everyone tries to change carp all the time
B009NY43NY|4.0|I fell in love with this series. I loved the main characters but I almost feel like the series went on for so long the author ran out of things to say and do that it just ended abruptly. I would definitely suggest reading as it closes out the long series but wasn't as impressed as I was with earlier books in this series
B008ULRY78|4.0|As a devote believer in all things Bruce Lee I am somewhat ashamed to say that the martial arts scenes in this film are extraordinary. . . sorry Bruce, I still worship you!  The subtitles are not necessary when communicating this level of art.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It looks like a slideshow not a video this app is a waste of time tubemate is so much better
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had great twists. This author does a great job with that. What upsets me is the ending is never the ending you want and sometimes you don't know if you like any of the charActers. But that's what makes this author good and her style unique which I can appreciate. Next stop: dark places!
B005IZLPMY|3.0|I wasn't very impressed with this movie whatsoever. Chris Evans is a great Captain America, but the movie in general was slow and very boring.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great game luv the old feel to it. The guns Are fantastic and the detail is amazing. This game is perfect for any ww2 gun enthusiast or fanatic
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This is definitely the best Iron Man, and the best Marvel film (next to Thor) ever. I'd recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a movie with great acting and great action.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|this game is the bet gangster game i ever played in my hole life in ten years and two mouths.
B0089EHWQE|1.0|So disappointing as this book was recommended to me. I couldn't even finish it as the pace and the obvious outcome were not enough to keep me reading. I got to about 40% of the book and couldn't stand the repetition.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This was my FAVORITE puzzle game on the computer, and now it's a kindle fire app! My wish has come true, now I can have my favorite complex mind game wherever I go! It's still as amazing as it is on a PC, and I'm very happy about that!
B005K17RU0|5.0|BEST weather app ever I love it.... it's always right on target. Which hugging huffing Dutch McHugh hugging clicking Kucinich justified
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Its so simple once you understand the 5 love languages. Its an easy read, easy to understand and very effective because its based on his real world proven experience with couples.<br /><br />Its been 3 weeks now that we have been applying the principles in the book, I know what my wife's love language is now, and she knows mine. Our communication has greatly improved, and our frustrations have largely disappeared. We still have a ways to go, but I am encouraged and confident that we are on the right track due to this book. We know we loved each other, but we did not know how to show it in the language of the other person... now we do !<br /><br />We are currently applying the principles to our children so we can speak their language as well.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed in this book. In fact I have it as an E-Book and we are buying it for each member of our family. Also according to the author the principles can also work if only one person is applying the principles.. so don't be discouraged if the other person does not want to read the book.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game but get annoyed when I tap to get a coin to drop and nothing happens. I tap several times but still nothing happens so I get too annoyed and quit playing the game.  Hope your game doesn't have this same problem.
B008C20TDG|5.0|My trainer recommended this book to me. Although I'm not finished with it yet, it is really eye-opening and well written.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The strength of this game is the variety of levels. Easy and hard we're interspersed freely, and I suspect that which solutions are &quot;obvious&quot; varies by person. It's usually easy to beat the level, but hard to get a perfect score. I found myself going back through to get a perfect on each level. About 5 hours gametime all told.
B005D4YGTY|5.0|These are, hands down, the most comfortable sandals I've ever worn. I got a pair of Newport H2s earlier and loved them.  So I decided to try the Newports to see if they could compare.  Man, they are great.  I don't think I will wear any sandals but Keens from now on.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Good fit for the older Kindle. Good functionality without too much more bulk. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a minimal case.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked this app until they did the recent upgrade. Now it's much less easy to use and find information, plus it occasionally crashes my Kindle Fire. I've been looking at other weather apps. Really a shame as they had a good thing, but I no longer like it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Still learning! Powerful Ap that will definitely keep me organized! Easy to use, and adapts to your personal preferences and needs.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|I'm making a trip to Scotland next month and was googling events in Glasgow to see what's on. I saw that someone named Caro Emerald is playing at the Glasgow Royal. I'd never heard of her so I googled her and listened to one cut on her first album. One song and I was hooked. I ordered the album, ordered tickets, have told all my friends, and I'm set! This album I ordered from the UK since it's not available yet in the States, and I love it just as much. She has a great voice--very sassy, smart, sexy, smoky--really knows how to sell a song. And the songs are catchy and clever. Great hooks. Musicianship and arrangements are stellar. Mixes are great. Transitions from song to song are intelligent. It's just a fun, fun album. Every song I think \\"That's my favorite!\\"--until the next song comes on. This is simply a great album and I can't WAIT to see her in Glasgow!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great book to read in the summer, took a while but it was worth it, can't wait for the next one
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|awesome theme, and storyline. Streaming was also very good quality. Will suggest everyone see this movie.Thanks for having this within the premiere collection
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham novels are always good and keep me engaged with the characters and plot - enjoyed this one very much.
