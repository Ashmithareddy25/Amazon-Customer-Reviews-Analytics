B0033PQUXA|5.0|There are multiple versions of this amazing film.  Amazon (US) sent me a PAL (EU) version for some reason. The US uses \\"NTSC\\" format.  A director's cut is about 120 min.  Another version is almost an hour longer.  The shorter version leaves some people dissatisfied as it lacks romantic plot resolution; the longer versions seems... too long ... for others.  Then there's Blu-Ray.  Just review the tech specs carefully so you don't spend a lot of time mailing stuff back to Amazon (who are very nice about all this).

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Possibly the first film Miyazaki wrote with the express intention of creating a film for young kids.<br />Compared with his other films, the drawings and coloring seem less detailed and vivid.<br />But the story is lovely and carries the film.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great movie.  The plot is based on the problem of getting all of these super heroes to be able to work together as a team.  The graphics are wonderful.  Such a great snowy day movie.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Truly a great read and a true classic. The 1992 movie with Gary Old man was as close to the book as can be.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I have read all 5 books in this series and am really looking forward to the release of the sixth book. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. If the series was written at a &#34;PG13&#34; level instead of an &#34;R&#34; level, I would have given it five stars. I would not be comfortable sharing this with anyone under 17 or 18 years old, which is unfortunate because it is such an engrossing storyline. It is easy to see why this is a best selling series. If you aren't concerned with the &#34;R&#34; level writing, you will probably consider this a 5-star book series. Enjoy.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The unrated version was hilarious. This is a movie for adults, the language is faul and the content is dirty. I look forward to anything else Seth comes out with...just wish he wasn't such a lib, LOL

B003SNJZ3Y|5.0|An amazingly clear account by a prominent economist on the central mystery of hedge funds:  do they really beat the market, and if so, how do they do it?  One by one, we are led through the various big names in the field to understand whether they are lucky or smart, and whether their advantages are permanent or transitory.  Do not be fooled by the pop title - this is incredibly well researched.

0062101897|5.0|This book is a must have for any Harry Potter fan out there.  It's HUGE and has so many details about the film making process and interviews with producers, directors, the cast, etc.  It goes through each film and focuses on specific aspects of each film.  The photos are great and you really get a glimpse behind the magic of the films and JK Rowling's detailed world.  It's such a fantastic book, I highly recommend it!

B003XRELGQ|5.0|I come to Vonnegut late, as I plow through a long list of recommended books. I was pleasantly surprised by the economy of Vonnegut's prose, which, along with its sharp wit, deft plotting and wicked characterization, lends a sharp sting to the satire even half a century on. Other reviewers have cannily summarized the plot; I will add only that the new reader will find in concentrate here many ideas greatly diluted in Vonnegut's followers, not the least of which is the evident wisdom of Cat's Cradle's faux religion. The protagonist's cleverly shifting point of view veils but never completely obscures his writerly role, as it shifts from researcher, to reporter to fatalistic memoirist. Were it not for dated epithets regarding race and disability, CC might have been written yesterday.

B006VUPCEM|5.0|Unisonic's self titled debut album is one that I had been looking forward to getting my hands on for quite some time (about 2 years) before its eventual release early in 2012.  They're a band made up of well known musicians who have been on the scene for quite a while now but ultimately though, this album is all about vocalist Michael Kiske, with the band being the platform to once again return Kiske's talents to the hard rock/metal world.<br /><br />What is interesting with Unisonic is that Kiske, Ward, Zafiriou and Werno are all members of Place Vendome, which still is a working band as well with a new album planned for 2013 release.  Therefore the difference between the two bands comes down to Place Vendome guitarist Uwe Reitenauer (also from Pink Cream 69) being replaced by Meyer and Hansen.  So is this band really a different band? Or is it Place Vendome with different guitarists?  One could consider that point but ultimately it is... pointless.  It's the music that separates the two, be it not all that greatly though in some songs.<br /><br />My initial reaction after buying the album and listening to it a few times was that of some disappointment, despite it's obvious quality.  That's because I was expecting more of a metal album with this one as that is what all the pre-release publicity said it would be.  Indeed it was hailed as Kiske's \\"return to metal\\".  What we have instead is an album made up of songs which do vary quite a bit stylistically, moving from melodic metal to hard rock, to a more AOR hard rock sound more consistent with the Place Vendome sound.  That being said though, the album generally does pack more punch than Kiske's other recent releases such as the two albums with the afore mentioned Place Vendome and the Magnus Karlsson initiated Kiske/Sommerville album.<br /><br />As previously stated, this is all about Michael Kiske and his amazing vocal talents.  Kiske has been around a while now, but this guy sure has a fantastic set of pipes on him and must definitely be still ranked right up there as one of the best singers around at the moment.  On this album the step up in the hardness of the music from Place Vendome may not be all that great, but it is enough to enable Kiske to push his abilities further than he has done in quite a while.  As a result he does deliver a great performance across the entire album, which the variety in musical styles actually highlight and enable him to do.<br /><br />So after initially forming the opinion this album should score 4 stars and shelving it for a few months I went back to it and was pleasantly surprised at how much I do actually like it, which is no doubt due to not having the expectations I initially did, and appreciating it for what it actually is.  This is an album that really does enable Kiske to shine and includes some great songs.  None are what I would call bad, but track three Never Too Late is one I sometimes skip because although it has some rocking guitar it just sounds a bit too light weight and commercial, and track six Never Change Me is a bit like that too but I still don't mind it.<br /><br />In total contrast are the two bonus songs The Morning After and Over The Rainbow.  These are two of the best songs and if you don't have them, then this album really isn't done the justice it deserves.  My version only has the latter, but thankfully I've managed to get The Morning After as well.  The Morning After starts off with a pretty low key intro, but soon picks up with the guitars and ends up being one of my favorite songs of 2012.  The melody on this one is sublime.  Over The Rainbow is another favorite too.  When I hear this I can't help but think of The Scorpions because it's a power ballad with a style that the Scorps perfected in songs like their classic cigarette lighter waving fan favourite Still Loving You.  The guitars on this one have a sound a lot like the kind of melodies that Matthias Jabs and Rudolph Schenker would do in their sleep, and Klaus Meine really would shine on this song.  But so does Kiske.  In fact I think it's his vocal highlight of the album along with My Sanctuary, another song of the same calibre but one which rocks a lot harder (actually this one is my favorite song of 2012).<br /><br />So I'm glad I left this album for a while and went back to it, so that I now fully appreciate it for what it is.  I hope they keep this line up, and they can call it whatever band name they like, just as long as we get more albums from them like this, with Kiske singing to his full potential.  But a little bit more metal next time would be good too ;-)<br /><br />Preferred Tracks: My Sanctuary, Over The Rainbow, The Morning After, I've Tried, Unisonic, Star Rider.d Klaus Meine really would shine on this song.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br />Th structure is a bit challenging but very well written.  Each section has a different style with memorable characters.  Structure if the novel described as Russian hollow dolls which seems reasonable.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I liked it a lot; even though I knew what to expect, having read the book first.  It lacked some of the depth and complexity of the book, but that is often the case; Still it was better than most movie versions of books; and the cinematography was stunning
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave catching fire 5 stars because it was a book that I never wanted to put down. There was nothing I didn't like about this book, as soon as you end this book you want the next book to know what happens next. I would suggest this series to anyone who liked twilight. And who likes to see a mental picture this book is good for that.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I usually like Meryl Streep; so thought I would like this movie; but found it boring, predictable, and disappointing--I took the change because of the low rental price, but would not recommend it. there was no chemistry between the main characters, and nothing to make it interesting.
B000002LND|5.0|In the mid 90's I was asked what great workout/inspirational CD I'd recommend. I told my client \\"The Immaculate Collection by Madonna\\". Our next appointment she said \\"what an amazing CD and tip, thank you\\". I smiled, knowing that whether you wanted to workout, dance or just enjoy some of the best pop music ever made, this was & is the answer! The album has sold more than 32 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist and one of the best selling albums of all time! Not too bad, huh? One of the amazing things is that this album has only the first 7 years of Madonna's music from 1983-1990, she had this many hits, success and it was only the beginning. If you like pop music and certainly if you like/love Madonna this is an easy high recomendation. 15 hits, 2 brand new songs, the international #1mega-hit \\"Justify my Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\", yet another worldwide hit. Many of the songs are remixed versions, which I think is a good thing. They're not vastly changed, mostly just enhanced. Get it, you'll love it like the rest of the world clearly does!!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'll say right off the bat that I'm not an avid reader of biographies. But I do love politics, and Ms. Kearns Goodwin's book dusts off the 150 years of history from this important time, and provides the ultimate insider view of our nation's government during this tumultous era. All the leading politicians of the time are described through theirs or others actual words, with Abraham Lincoln's life and complex personality revealed in particularly exquisite detail. The author's portrayal of Lincoln is a sympathetic one, but she never flinches from revealing his personal weaknesses and foibles. In the end, the reader gains a deep appreciation for the man many believe is our greatest president not in spite of, but because of his ability to rise above his own human frailities.<br /><br />Regarding the politics itself, Kearns Goodwin shows that Lincoln demonstrated an astonishing level of skill and acumen as he advanced his legislative agenda through a Congress even more divided than the one we have today. It is particularly impressivive that he was able to do so while building his mostly-deserved reputation among the people as &#34;Honest Abe&#34;.  Today's politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, would be well-served by reading this book and emulating Lincoln's approach to public policy leadership.<br /><br />If you only read one biography...ever...this is the one.
B007Y36K46|3.0|Based on what I saw so far--I can say that it is probably fun, tho a bit too &#34;campy&#34; for my taste--which is part of the reason I haven't finished it yet. It's not something I usually watch, but the price was right...
B0084IG8TM|5.0|If you read the book then you must see the film. When I saw the film I  thought it was true to the book, it had very good special effects. It is in the group of &#34;Harry Potter films&#34;, suspenseful, lots of action and adventure. I know teenagers and adults will enjoy this fatasy packed film.

B00932A6G4|3.0|There were good things and bad things about this movie.  Naturally, it falls short of Heinlein's masterpiece.  The CGI is good, but in some places the dubbing looked really off.  A large cast of characters that kind of blended together (other than the \\"Big Three\\" of Rico, Carmen, and Carl).  The attempts to add more depth to them fell short in my opinion and I thought it would have been more effective to focus on a smaller cast.<br /><br />I found a few points that put a strain on my ability to swallow the story (such as the durability of the John A. Warden, Carmen boarding a ship with no gloves on her hands even though she's wearing a helmet), but overall the story was enjoyable enough for the 24 hour rental period.  I wouldn't be as pleased with the full cost and would probably have given it 2 stars.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. It has helped me stay on track with my Bible reading. For a person with Dyslexia apps like these are needed. You can set it to where you are only reading so much at a time. When looking at a true Bible typewritten and printed on paper sometimes all the worth run together and then frustrate the dyslexic mind making it nearly impossible to read with its already confessing languages.<br /><br />So why the four star? Because your updates are causing more harm than good. The app force classes no matter what device I am on So I can't follow along in church with my Pastors live thing. Nor can I use this as a teaching tool with my girls in my girls ministries class who are often forgetting their Bibles but never forgetting their phones and love to use them. I cannot use it at the Women's Bible study either because it is unpredictable when it will force close.<br /><br />None the less for all its flaws it is still a good app to make me accountable for daily Bible reading in private time. Just please try to fix the flaws but thanks for the free app.

It did remind me a lot of 50 Shades..but I didn't mind that. Mystery and sex - loved the characters...Loved Gideon!! I couldn't put either book down. Can't wait for book 3 to come out.

So many twist and turns that, \\"I really needed a chapter break\\".  Nothing and no one is what they seem and I was initially left speechless but once the initial shock wore off I was like a freaking lunatic screaming back at this book during New Year's Eve. Thanks Colleen for making my family think that I'm even weirder . . .  but you now what? That's how you know that a book is really good. ;)
1609611543|2.0|First, let me say how disappointed I am in this silly witch-hunt of a book. As a 66-year-old man, looking for quick and easy solutions to shed the fat-suit that time and age has enrobed me with, I was intrigued when I saw this book in Costco. When I got home, I went on-line to investigate further and found a hornet's nest of conflicting opinions and so-called facts about the evil of Demon Wheat in all it's nefarious forms. Against a niggling sense of \\"Balderdash!\\", I plunked my money down and, in the time it took to throw away my seed-covered, multi-grained, brown-hued, \\"loaf of death\\", my new lease on life had arrived. But..it was not to be. Instead, I got a shrill re-hash of the Atkins Diet. Only this time Evil Wheat was the plague upon the land. WHEAT! In all it's vile and nefarious forms! It's in our lip balm! It's on our envelopes! Puh-leeze! I realize that I will be shouted down from every corner of the land by people crowing and shrieking about their own dramatic transformations: Stunning weight loss! Bad breath conquered! Flat feet sprouting young and healthy arches! The gall bladders of a 17-year-old! Huzzah!<br />  If you were in that bad of shape to start with, I'm pretty sure not eating bread, some, but not all, forms of cheese, or licking envelopes would be the last of your worries. To me, this is just another book by another \\"Doctor\\" demonizing one form of food or exercise. Millions jump on the bandwagon for weeks or months, all with varying degrees of success. Eventually, the mob moves to another book or \\"shiny object\\", promising \\"amazing results\\" and life changing experiences. Save your money and stop stuffing yourself from dawn to dusk. There! I just saved you twenty bucks!

1401223176|5.0|This book is amazing the way the new villain Hush is presented and he has dark connections to Bruce Wayne's past. I will not spoil the story at all. Batman gets beaten and battered. Hush is a very tactical with his approach towards Batman. The art is really good and that is to be expected from the legendary Jim Lee. Some of the poses Batman is in are so epic with the nice inking and coloring. This is pre New 52 and if you like this get Batman Vol.1: The Court of Owls which is also a great book with fantastic art. 5/5 stars!

B002N57KG2|5.0|I love this movie as it has lots of my favourite actors in it.  I just had lots of laughs and you could see that everyone enjoyed themselves.  Cameo's of Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Junior were brilliant and of course Dom Deloise is always fun.
1451695195|4.0|Very interesting--a little hard to follow--plan to reread. I liked the fact that Dr. Alexander is highly trained and successful in his profession.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I have to say that it was a very fun and good book and it is really a very good book
0142413828|5.0|The images are unforgettable. The language is descriptive. Children are puzzled at first by the ugly situations and disgusting characters. However,later they become so fascinated by the book that next request would certainly be one of the books of Roald Dahl.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|On my way home on a crowed NYC subway this games makes my ride smooth and take my mind off of the interesting people around me.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The movie got here when it was supposed to. The season was phenomenal. I could watch it 10 more times
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a great read which balanced the graphic details with keeping it &#34;clean&#34; enough for most people to handle. The writing style is easily readable while not making you feel like a child.
0547260695|5.0|It is the best reading material I have ever offered to quite a range of my students. The book is extremely entertaining by providing my students with visual examples,on the one hand; and supplying them with intricate content,on the other hand. Therefore, I achieved  my goal: the students do not only enjoy reading the book, but also improve their language and their ability to decipher endless situations and implications. I wish I could find more books of this kind.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I give it three stars because in some spots is was good then the next second it was bad so in the middle
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who is 23, she asked for it and for the price it was worth it
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Great movies. They look superb on blu-ray. Each movie in its own case in this box set. Great deal with this set.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|this product is pretty ok for me. no the best though. I do use it all the time and it is much better then just hand held with a DSLR.  If you are looking for something that you can use in tight spaces or clubs where they don't want you to have a big rig with you this is perfect. the 2 reasons im giving this 4 stars are: 1. the shoe mount on top doesn't stay in place very well. the biggest deal for me since i only use a light weight light on top. the only time it is a problem for me is taking the light on and off. but i could see where it would be a bigger problem for someone else. the other reason and i know this is picky is 2. i would have liked to have seen 15mm rails instead of flat feet on the bottom. great for what it is i would still recommend one to anyone that doesn't have a hand held alternative yet. but i would plan on upgrading eventually.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This group is so innovative. I love their amazing arrangements and clever use of their instruments to get all possible sounds out of them. If you love good jazz/easy listening you will love this.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The case cover is easy to use, fits the Kindle well & very cute!  I Realy like it a lot!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wonderful read! I really enjoy reading this book no matter how many times I've read it before. There is always something new.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|what a stupid movie..it was interesting for about 2minutes then it became typical Dane Cook  jack ass stupidity..I feel sorry for the people of today..there choices of entertainment are lame..such mindless drivel that is passedoff as entrainment..Ellsworth Monkton Toohey would be proud..no wonder so many think &#34;Right to work&#34; and anti Union is the correct choice..they have no concept of what quality actually is..mark Whalberg  made a few movies that were worthwhile..like the Italian Job..this movies SUCKS
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The movie had a little too much drug references in it for my liking. I expected some bad language, some sexual content but wasn't ready for all the drug references. It was good move to rent, glad I didn't go to the theater to watch it.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|I don't know much about Carly Rae Jepsen other than I have heard this song and really enjoy it, so I bought it!
0634022296|5.0|I can't say enough about this book!  Straight forward, easy to follow.  Chords are right there for you to see...amazed!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! I love Holder and Sky's relationship, they are so connected, it really shows you the true meaning of true love.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|just one of the best classic movies i have ever seen! just funny & quirky! its an oldie but a goodie, im 30 & i love the music and i can watch this over & over!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The best game I have gotten so far for my Kindle Fire. Loading normally takes a really long time but that is my only complaint.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First of all this story is NOT under-aged Porn (for all you reviewers who claim as such).  This book is reality, as unkind as it is.  Secondly, a review is nothing more than the opinion of the reviewers feelings on how well the book is written, the artistic value and the message(s)...should there be any, is conveyed.  A review should NOT be about the reviewers religious beliefs or personal opinion on the subject matter.  That being said; moving on...<br /><br />Sky Davis is smart.  She's mature.  She's comfortable in her own skin and doesn't take crap off of anyone.  She doesn't play games.  She's adopted and has been home schooled her whole sheltered life.  She decides to enroll in public school for her Senior year and finds out she's got a slutty reputation.  It doesn't matter to her.  She's indifferent and nothing really ever bothers her.  She simply doesn't care what anyone thinks.  She knows the truth and that is...she is NOT loose.  She lives in a home that has no internet, phones or TV.  This is a choice made by her vegan, free-spirited mother.  Sky is used to living without modern technologies.  She's never been interested enough in a single boy to have an intimate relationship (and there have been many who've tried to be intimate with her)...until she meets Dean Holder.<br /><br />Dean Holder (Holder) hasn't been attending the same school (that Sky now goes to), for the last two semesters.  And now he's back.  Holder is not an easy person to read.  He's unpredictable.  He's also genuine and devoted to Sky.  There's nothing he wouldn't do for her.  He's had a very hard, unhappy life.<br /><br />This Author can certainly paint an intimate picture, savoring every nuance the characters are feeling and transferring those emotions so adeptly into a story.  The deep, profound message of this story is a stark reminder of the hidden abuses we unknowingly live among.  It's also a reminder that the very things that knock you down in life are tests.  And those tests force us to make the choices between giving in and staying on the ground, or standing up and wiping the dirt off and moving on...standing taller.<br /><br />Even though this is a mature YA novel and not something I'd normally pick up to read...I'm glad it passed my way as it opened my eyes...and I bawled buckets.  BUCKETS!  I normally do not gravitate to stories that are going to cause me to bawl buckets, but every once in awhile it's necessary to pull our heads out of the ground and face what goes on around us.  More often than we care to admit.  Brava Ms. Hoover...  Brava and Encore!rce us to make the choices between giving in and staying on the ground, or standing up and wiping the dirt off and moving on...standing taller.<br /><br />Even though this is a mature YA novel and not something I'd normally pick up to read...I'm glad it passed my way as it opened my eyes...and I bawled buckets.

0062200909|5.0|My sons are illustrators and they poured over this book. Even though it was for one of the boys, I'm sure they will all want it.
1465001107|4.0|the photos in this calendar are beautiful and it's nicely put together-I gave it 4 stars only because the ink was smeared for the month of july, on the date/day part in a small section. not enough to return,since I love the photos so much. it took longer than I expected to arrive,but well worth the wait.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|if you don't know what this series of games is, then it won't do any good trying to explain it to you.  Find someone with a tablet / smartphone, or even a roku xs, and become addicted to solving the puzzles.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|christmas movie's are so good and some are not made the same way they use to be.  This movie has everything in it for a nice, funny, holiday movie
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Is a dog lover and has spent many hours  with a very special dog.  Love  the way he has told the story from the dogs point of view.  I spent  13 wonderful years with my own  baron.  I enjoyed the feelings that perhaps he had many similar experiences,  very sad at times. But l could hardly put it down, this was a really amazing book.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|if you're a Michael Jackson fan, you'll want to own this video! the bad era is one of my favorites-so this performance was terrific, one of many MJ concert vids that I love.
B009MO57H6|3.0|I have been a fan of the Resident Evil games since I played the first one back in 97.the last one i played was part 4.I could not really get into part 5 and got the demo on part 6 but didnt really get into it.and it looks like the same could be said for the movies.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie a lot but was disappointed because they didnt use none of the characters from the game(not that I remember.been a long time since i seen the original).lots of actions and pretty good storyline.stayed along the same lines of the games.<br /><br />The second one was my favorite.it had some of the characters from the game and almost non stop action.just like the game and the reason I got into the games.<br /><br />The third one bored me.lame storyline and very little action.i honestly could not tell you what it was about.<br /><br />The fourth one was pretty good.same story line but was kinda lame on the action but for the most part really good.especially since they finally put in Albert Wesker.so  was looking forward to this one<br /><br />I love the fact that it is non stop action.it is like most of the movie is just pure action.so that was a plus for me.some say all the action stunk but if that is the reason you got into the movie,then it didnt not let down.<br /><br />The problem is the storyline.it is really hard to follow.one minute they are fighting together.then against each other.I thought they would go after Wesker more but Wesker helps them out.and the whole thing takes place in Moscow.it seems like it is the same boring storyline over and over with nothing new.I am not saying take away the them fighting Zombies or people infected with something.but are they going to play this whole thing with wesker out for 4,5 more movies?<br /><br />i think they need to change it up some.a new story line,new characters,etc.<br /><br />It is a good movie but i think the storyline is wearing thin.it is always Alice that saves the day.they should find something new like a new main character,new bad guys,anything.I dont think this movie can last much longer along the same storyline.it is like 5 different remixes of the same song.after a while,it is just the same song being beat to death.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|great movie. full of action.<br /><br />The fact that i have to put 18 words in order to submit a review is ridiculous!!  Makes me not want to review anything
1567184855|5.0|This book was so wonderful I bought the others listed in the back flap. I read all the Jane Roberts books and after that was on the look out for something like this. I never thought I would find it. This is not about religion. It is about spirit, soul, and the after life.
B008N1V11U|5.0|do you know what would make it awesome if it was free for the kindle fire then I would definitely buy it
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The movie provided an enlightening background of the English monarchy in the 1930's AND was entertaining! Acting was excellent but Colin Firth was extraordinary.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Got this as a gift for my friend.  awesome, awesome, movie.  Cant say enough. but for the word limit sake lets stop here.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|I LOVE THIS FILM, IT ALWAYS TOUCH MY HEART DEEPLY.  I WILL PREFER THAT THE &#34;LOVE SCENES&#34; SHOULD BE OMITTED.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was Awesome from start to finish. Batman was great and the story line was great as well.  Love the special effects as well.
B001NIA27E|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in years, but my daughter had to do a report on the science in some movies and how it relates to how science happens in reallity. While there were things that were sped-up for cinematic effect, it did a pretty good job keeping with how science in the real world would happen.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|love love love love love. Moving, honest, funny, insightful, and one of a kind. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good read
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This book is one of the best historical fiction novels I have read.  Set in mid 15th century England, it tells of the struggle for power between the houses of Lancaster and York through the eyes of a young women.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Did not have any problems with the DVD - I would highly recomment this TV show and series.  It's nice to be able to watch the episodes without commercial interruption.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great read- made me cry at the end. Wish Enzo could have been at the homecoming of the daughter though.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|OMG! I just wanted a nice slendy game but this is over the top. Who would of guessed he would walk. The ground is not just flat and slendy has tentacles on occasion. The only problem is that it turns upside down sometimes. It is super scary and all around fun.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This is nothing like the other Bourne movies.  It's long, there's barely any plot, and barely any action.  It was definitely a waste of $5 and 2 hours.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this show and am glad I got this set when I did as it is now $20.00 more than when I bought it in early December.<br /><br />The episodes are the original UK version with the Christmas Episode and special features.  I will wait for the limited edition of seasons 3 and 4 if they put one out next year.<br /><br />Just love everything about it, the characters, the cast, the costumes, settings, the castle, the beautiful countryside, etc.  Cannot wait for Season 3 this weekend.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is a great series with great story lines.  I just ordered the  third and fourth season.  This is must see!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very gripping and a book that I could not put down.<br />I will be reading the next book in this series shortly.
0765356139|4.0|As with most middle entry into a trilogy, the timing in this book is off, there is a lot of filler and Vin (main protagonist) is becoming whiny. Vin is great when she is being the all powerfull ass kicker, however she often returns to being an insecure little girl doubting her boyfriend's love way too often.<br />With the main treat now out of the picture it seems to me that people like Vin would rise up and become the power holders instead of the previous nobility. Vin  and other \\"Allomancers\\" are basically one-man armies, all powerfull and unstoppable (except by other allomancers) why isn't one of these allomancers setting themselves up as Emperor!<br />I still liked the conlcusion and the overall book, but I wished it was shorter so that more of the stroy would be advanced.
B0051OZ564|1.0|Sucker Punched is how I felt watching this.  While the cinematography was very well done and given a real script it could have been an action fantasy in the new noire style of Sin City etc. it instead pushes a bunch of poorly stitched fantasy MTV videos together in a dismal attempt to come off vaguely philosophical or something, jury is still out on whether there was a point.I wouldn't mind seeing more from the crew who put it together as long as they get a script and troop of actors worthy of the effort... Somehow Cruel & Unusual films is a perfect name for this production company.
6304907648|5.0|I like movies like this cause they keep you on the edge of you seat. Its a real nail bitter and pretty scarey actually
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the first I read on my kindle and what a good choice it was! And the best part is I can instantly buy the 3rd book and start at the cliff it left off at. So glad my boyfriend recommend this trilogy to me! Fast paced, easy read.
0765350386|4.0|I loved this book, the characters are interesting and more human than those usually found in fantasy (even if they have powers).<br />The magic system is new and interesting, my only problem with it, is that there doesn't seem to be a cost to this magic. A select few individuals have the power to ingest metals which gives them certain powers for a limited time (strength, speed, emotional manipulations, pushing and pulling (telekenesis). When the metals are \\"burned out\\" the powers stop, use of the powers doesn't cause fatigue and don't take anything out of the users.<br />The story is centered around a heist and moves along briskly, the payoff is good although it leaves you with a lot of questions, I wished the conclusion included more chatter with the big bad. Since I really liked this book I will read the sequel to hoepfully find the answers.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Very fast overnight delivery.  Case works well and helps the reader keep his hands off the display, which can sometimes cause erroneous commands being accidently given to the system.  I recommend the cover as a cost-effective additrion to the KindleFire.
B005XZR4NI|5.0|This movie is so great i love it. It makes me laugh everytime i watch it the part about korean jesus is the best and i crack up even now just thinking about it
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a must have for anyone that is a fan of the Batman series. Incredible quality movies especially when watched on Blu-Ray.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|After reading all the great reviews for this game I decided to buy it for my 9 year old nephew for Christmas.  He wanted a gift cars to Game Stop,  he is an avid video game player and spends most of his free time playing Mindcraft on line. I wanted to get him seething we could play as a family.  Settlers of Catan was his favorite Christmas gift!  We played several games over the holiday with my 7 year old son and my husband.  Each game has a different dynamic as the board is different every time.<br /><br />The strategy aspect of the game is really great!  It forces the kids to really think about how they want to play the game.  It reminds me south of the business strategy classes I took while getting my MBA.  This game is great for anyone ages 9 and up!  I will be buying the expansion packs for my nephews birthday.
3832755934|5.0|Print quality is good. (I'll probably frame a couple of months next year.) There's plenty of space for writing in appointments and it's fun to see the days of the week in other languages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wonderfully developed game that is great any time you need something to fidget with or something to focus on :D
B000002UVX|5.0|This is a great live album.  By far Jimi's best album - all you need is this and a best of collection.  One of the best live albums ever.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app does not work properly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am experiencing the same problems that other users have reported for months. The news feed only displays a few items and then locks up. Please correct!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed the suspense in the Racketeer.  The ending was a little far fetched howver the book was intriquing and kept me interested.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I did not expect it would be so soul shaking as it was...about the karma of a group of reincarnated characters over good and evil over 5-6 lifetimes...the more you analyze the movie afterwards and put the puzzle pieces together..the more you love and get it..my interpretation: it's about the free will of each character surrounding by the main force of evil, (tom hanks) to redeem himself little by little over several lifetimes in order to help the good in humanity win in the future...the music is lovely. The cinemetography is gorgeous..nice action..look very forward to its release as I wish to watch it with my family :):)
B0030B624E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies I highly recommend it to anybody who loves dark zombie comedies. It's one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it, so if you don't completely get it the first time you will probably like it more the second time, I know I did. Overall great movie that keeps a close reality on what your personal life would be like in the zombie apocalypse.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Lol this book is better then the other six!<br />Defiantly a great buy for a great price.<br />Worth every penny
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|We absolutely loved this movie. Not as dark as the previous Dark Knight movie. I would highly recommend this. We did have a problem with the streaming in the middle. We simply restarted the movie and it started and continued from where we left off without an issue. Probably our system issue not Amazon.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought a wide angle lens and the built in flash left shadows.  This fixes the problem and works great without being too expensive.
B009DT9DBQ|5.0|This show sounds amazing, and covers everything from Guns N Roses, to Slash's Snakepit, to Velvet Revolver, to solo record. I highly recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fascinating read and full of medical information to back up the authenticity. I do have a problem accepting the \\"you can do no wrong\\" pronouncement of the angels.  How would that apply to the man who guns down adults and children and then kills himself? What would they say to him? Interesting book and should be added to others that detail the NDE experience.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When me and my family got flow we played for 3 days strait. And still today we play it to pass time and just for fun.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was such a romantic story!  Some of the bondage bothered me in the fifty books.  I love the story between Eva and Gideon!!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie meandered and went from one turn to another. Wasn't happy with the villian's end (spoiler?). Great surprises and some fun to watch. Don't think it matches the other two movies.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Very quick, nice packaging. Also very good movie worth watching more then once.. lot romance n some comedy and it is a chick flick movie this was second greatest one..step up one was still first best... hope this help
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is a \\" must have\\" for a rock music collection. Zeppelin will always be a rock icon and this collection proves that they can still leave us dazed and confused
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The movie has a few touching and funny moments. Overall I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 30 unless they still think like teenagers. No disrespect to teens but some of this stuff could only appeal to a bunch of guys or girls downing beers and drugs.What a waste of Mila Kunis.
1451695195|3.0|The book was similar to others I have read, only big difference was a Dr. penned this one.  Don't know if that made it more convincng or not.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this is the best game on the market cant wait for next expansion neurax worm was great really want the next oneself
B0071T4BVC|4.0|A nice quite album that shows off Paul's talents.  This is a great album to listen to on a long car trip.
B003XTUZIM|4.0|Review of `Islands' 40th Anniversary CD plus MLP Lossless 5.1 & DTS digital surround DVD package.<br /><br />***<br /><br />`Islands' was released in December 1971, exactly one year after `Lizard'. This was the final studio release from the Fripp-Sinfield era, before Bob Fripp reconstituted the band in 1973 and ushered in the great Bruford-Wetton period.<br /><br />For `Islands', Boz Burrell took over on bass and vocals; a gutsier & more powerful singer than Gordon Haskell, & adequate-but-not-great bass player who Fripp taught the entire KC repertoire note-for-note. Ian Wallace (suggested to Fripp by Keith Emerson in whose house Wallace was living at the time) played drums. Collins, Fripp & Sinfield formed the remainder of the line-up, unchanged since the `Poseidon' project. A number of other musicians join the party, including once again Keith Tippett on piano, plus Robin & Harry Miller & Mark Charig on various wind instruments.<br /><br />The original album:<br /><br />Overall `Islands' is more of a jazz-rock album than `Lizard' but with an odd mix of just 6 songs, 2 of them purely instrumental. The theme running through the album is of islands & the sea, kicking off with the laid-back `Formentera Lady' evoking a languid summer love affair on a Mediterranean island; a slow cello starts things off, over which flute & Tippett's piano cadences lead into the main theme with other instruments gradually joining the party.  `Sailor's Tale' follows, purely instrumental with a jazz-fusion feel and the whole band on top form, a perennial live-gig favourite for the band during this era which builds from a quiet start to a crescendo climax. `The Letters' is a dark song about a betrayed wife being taunted by her husband's lover in poison-pen letters, with great musical dynamics, screeching electric guitar from Fripp & powerful singing from Boz. 'Ladies of the Road' is a funky-jazz number about life on the road with groupies, with what would now be seen as highly misogynistic lyrics, some great sax playing from Mel Collins and a hilarious `guitar orgasm' from Fripp! `Prelude - Song of the Gulls' is another instrumental number with the melody provided by a soprano sax over orchestral strings, and the closer `Islands' rounds off the album with a laid-back oboe over mellotron, great sax from Collins & another fine vocal line from Boz.<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary offering.<br /><br />As with other Steven Wilson KC releases in this series, a CD plus audio-only DVD are presented in a gatefold sleeve decorated with the original album cover artwork, radio-telescope images of the Crab Nebula (in a genuine crimson colour). A 16-page colour booklet with all song lyrics, archive photos & story behind the music, written by Bob Fripp and Crimson biographer Sid Smith, completes the package.<br /><br />The DVD is the star of the show with the music offered in MLP Lossless 5.1 surround, DTS 5.1 digital surround, MLP Lossless stereo & PCM stereo 2.0. The DVD graphics are easy-on-the-eye & the menu easy to navigate. On the DVD you get:<br /><br />* the 2010 stereo mix<br />* the original album<br />* a stereo 16/48 `Alternate Album' including previously unreleased `A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls'<br />* a section called `Routes to Islands' tracing the development of the music including the Islands line-up of the band rehearsing `Pictures of a City'<br />* Several additional studio takes of `Ladies of the Road' & `Formentera Lady'<br /><br />Fripp and Wilson have once again produced a fine package, this time with even more extra material than usual.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|The app works great. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs an app to check their battery life on their kindle fire.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|As a female, I jump for joy every time a woman appears on something labeled \\"metal.\\" I was incredibly disappointed, especially when I saw all the great reviews of this band. This is a pop album, not a metal album. Congratulations to the record companies for catering pop music to people who don't like Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce. As a metalhead, I say this album is pure garbage. Nothing is metal simply because a band uses distortion.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|This was and is a favorite of mine.  I have watched the complete series once since buying it, and am now watching it again. The writing and acting are superb, and it is unfortunate that this wonderful show was cancelled because the demographic was women over 40.  Dumb move.  Quality is quality, and I'd rather watch a carefully and lovingly produced series like this instead of the &#34;reality programming&#34; that is so pervasive these days.  The first movie is not up to the quality of the series.  The second movie, however, is very well done, despite the absence of Chad Allen.  I have read that the entire cast is willing to do another movie, 12 years after the second.  Now the problem.  I suffer from a hearing loss, and there is no closed-captioning available on this set, or any other &#34;Dr. Quinn&#34; home video package.  That said, I'm glad I bought this set, and will continue to treasure and enjoy it.   Edited 3/8/2016.  I was told by a friend that Amazon was now offering a set with subtitles.  An Amazon rep assured me that was the case and so I ordered it.  It arrived today.  No subtitles.  Back it goes.  Very disappointed.  Bad business, Amazon.

B0075HP2K4|4.0|This is one of my current favorite albums.  Her voice and the sound on her songs are terrific.  I particularly like first 3 tracks on the album - 1901, Skinny Love, People help the people.  Well worth the price of the album.  The songs from Bon Iver are better as done by Birdy in my opinion.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Again, Preston & Childs grabs you and sucks you in to their latest thriller. I can only hope that there's more to come. I have read everyone of their books and have not yet been disappointed.  Can't wait for the next one - Put me on the waiting list.

B002RI9UBS|4.0|I would've given it 5 stars but i felt the bit where Pi lands on the island was a little far fetched. And I am sure the movie will not be as in depth as the book. ( They never are)<br /><br />I would recommend it to a few friends who would find this book very fascinating and adventurous.<br /><br />My understanding from previews I saw on TV is that the only stow away besides Pi on the boat is the Bengel TIger, surprisingly not according to the book.<br /><br />Mercedes

B0055PMURG|5.0|I love this movie, it was really well done and I'll continue to watch it often. The kids I babysit showed it to me and the younger one (5) gets scared during the shark attack scene and gets a little bored with it later on, so I'd say it's best for 10 and up.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well if you think this is a preppy high school love story with cheerleaders and jocks, it's not. Of course there are some elements there because they are seniors, but it's a intriguing story beyond what you are thinking. I really enjoyed this book and is my first book by this author. I finished it in one day and let me tell you I neglected a lot of things that had to be done. I say this book was like an emotional roller coaster. It made me laugh, cry, mad, embarrassed for the characters, shocked me and had me at the edge of my bed..really. The love story is definitely there, but there is way more to it.<br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I felt the author could have been more descriptive throughout the book in describing the characters and certain settings/places. Don't get me wrong she did describe, but I felt she could have been more descriptive. Same with the main characters she describes Sky the heroine when she has her hair down or up, but I just wanted a little more...that's just me. It didn't deter me from reading of course. I loved the story.

1455527475|5.0|This book is a great portrayal of life in Wall Street. You'd think that Wall Street is so big and full of \\"smart\\" people that there would be more people like Greg Smith who come out in public and speak their conscience about how business is done. Not the case, Wall Street remains a very secretive place with a lot of deals done in a dark room with 5 or 6 guys shaking hands. I applaud this guy for doing it. Most of the big firms are far more concerned about reputation than the law (and rightfully so) and this makes the book even more significant. I found this book to be a very accurate portrayal of life in the street. Being in the financial services myself I was able to relate to a lot of the stories regarding training and being a young trader at GS. Also, it was easy to identify with stories about office politics and how business is done at GS. Anyone looking to buy this book should know that Greg is no Michael Lewis but this is probably a good thing. Some of the stories are a bit dry but at the same time accurate. I found Michael Lewis fun to read but some of the stories are highly exaggerated. But I digress.....<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that it does not go far enough. Some of the anecdotal stories that Greg recounts regarding ridiculous behavior on the parts of the managers and partners are really standard practice in Wall Street. Anyone working in the financial services will quickly learn that there is an abundance of a holes and irresponsible behavior is often rewarded well. Also, the main point of the book that clients are viewed as the enemy is again standard practice in the street. This was more so the case before 2008 but even nowadays there have not been a lot of changes. In many cases the hedge fund stars are the salespeople who bring in all the money and not the guy that manages the portfolios. I would have liked to see a bit more of the irresponsible behavior in the book and am not sure why Greg did not go all the way. A good reasonfor this might be because as I mentioned above there is no trail for these types of shenanigans....you really have to be there to see it and believe it.<br /><br />Finally I was surprised at all the negative press that this book got which really supports the author's thesis. I saw Greg in an interview with Maria Bartiromo and she just wouldn't shut up about why the author stayed at GS for 11+ years and then wrote this book. It's a valid question but that's really all she focused on. I can say from personal experience that you really need a good 5-6 years to really understand what really is going on in terms of how things work in a big firm like GS and in Wall Street. And it might be that he postponed it a bit for personal reasons (US papers maybe?) or other reasons.  Whatever the reason is the fact that there is gross disrespect for clients in Wall Street remains true. What's really disturbing is that it's common practice and yet you don't hear many if any people point it out.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|Very nice edition of Sherlock Holmes for your collection. The set up and quality is very nice indeed. The collection gives you the essentials and is a great introduction to Holmes & Watson. If you're into the BBC series this will give you a bit of a refresher on the storyline as well even if the television version is updated a bit.

I ordered it for a Christmas gift, however amazon predicted it would come much later than expected. I contacted seller about it, but they ensured it would get here on time. I should have known better, the book came a few days after Christmas. Also, the paperback version from the UK does not look like the blue hardcover cover in the description at all, it is actually orange.<br /><br />Aside from the set backs, the product came in great shape! I just wish it would have arrived on time.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|The newest animated feature from DC Entertainment is one of its most anticipated releases, and for good reason. It was The Dark Knight Returns that turned the comic world on its head in the 80′s. The stark reality, the darkness, even for the Dark Knight, was darker than ever. Batman vs the Mutants. Batman vs The Joker. Batman vs Superman. The storyline is epic, but how did the first part of this animated retelling do: did it do the cowl justice?<br /><br />Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is considered one of the greatest comics of all time, and I agree completely. So, I was overjoyed and a little worried when I heard that it was becoming a two part animated feature. What would they change? What would they \\"dumb down\\"? Would it still feel like The Dark Knight Returns? The answer, I am happy to report, is yes. Part 1 has the look and feel of Frank Miller's classic, and fans really can't ask for more.<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where Batman has been retired for 10 years...and before people moan about \\"it's ripping off Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Rises\\", remember that this came out in the 80′s as a comic, back before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was even seeing Angels in the Outfield. Bruce is a shell of a man: cold, out of place, and seeking an end. That all changes when he realizes the rise of the deadly mutants in Gotham, which makes him realize that The Batman is needed. Peter Weller, best known for his starring role in Robocop 1 and 2, voices the aging dark knight, and he does a superb job of doing so. All the voice talents really step it up a notch and create something special, something masterful.<br /><br />Now, what about the violence? Was it toned down? Not by much, thankfully. We still see what happens during a meeting with the Mayor and the Mutant Leader, we see the knock down, drag out fight between Bruce and the Mutant Leader, and we see the new, female Robin, who is this time the young Carrie Kelly. All the parts that made the book for me are present here: the newscasters, the odd speaking mutant gang, the massive and intimidating Bruce Wayne and his \\"Batmobile\\". For me, this is the best animated film DC has made to date, and that's saying something. I cannot wait for part two, to see The Joker, Clark Kent, Green Arrow, and the Anti-Superman Armor Batman. Highly recommendedfor me are present here: the newscasters, the odd speaking mutant gang, the massive and intimidating Bruce Wayne and his \\"Batmobile\\".

B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you have not seen it, and like the characters, buy it. This movie might make it to classic status.
B00993FEUK|4.0|I have seen trailers for ParaNorman since last year. When I saw the first one, which had a very odd song choice for the trailer and nothing to really grab the audience, I thought it was an easy pass. Then, the more I saw of the film, including the giant witch head in the sky, it made me want to actually give the film a shot. So, does this animated feature have a story as great as the animation looks, or is it a script that should have remained in the grave?<br /><br />ParaNorman comes from Laika, Inc., the studio responsible for the 2009 animated film, Coraline. So, of course, the stop motion animation looks amazing. But what about the story? Our hero of the film is Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a kid who can see and communicate with ghosts. Now, being the weird kid is always tough, and being the weird kid that sees ghosts is even tougher. Befriended by fellow social outcast Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), Norman's life gets even stranger when his distant uncle (John Goodman) comes with a bizarre warning that Norman must step up to protect his town. Protect from what? A witch that was convicted of, well, witchcraft, and killed in the very town Norman lives in many years ago. This is where the film picks up, and it really does an outstanding job of telling a compelling story.<br /><br />Now, ParaNorman has another thing going for it, and that is that it takes advantage of the 3D craze going around. Being the first stop motion film to use color 3D printers, this colorful and imagination filled world really pops with the 3D glasses. Remember, the 3D these days is meant to give the film a sense of depth, and for ParaNorman, it exceeds that aspect easily. This is definitely a film go the extra mile on and see in glorious 3D.<br /><br />All in all, for an animated film, it did have some more mature themes in it, but it also had some important life lessons and an amazing ending. The story is original, the characters are memorable, and the zombies look great on screen; what more can you ask for? One of the best animated films this year, make sure to catch ParaNorman on DVD or Blu Ray.ou ask for? One of the best animated films this year, make sure to catch ParaNorman on DVD or Blu Ray.

B0002STNQ2|1.0|I hate to speak ill of the deceased Michael Crichton, but this book was terrible.  Dr. Crichton spends way too much time on the trials and tribulations of whiny househusband Jack Foreman.  The middle of the book gets somewhat interesting if you can overlook the fact that a team of programmers suddenly become action heroes and kick ass and take names.  Lead by the aforementioned Jack Foreman.<br /><br />I had finally made it to the last disk, and some of the ridiculous dialog made me finally just give up.  I only regret there is no rating below one star.

B00A0SJWQU|1.0|I don't know why I keep watching movies starring Colin Farell.  Is he doomed with poor scripts and story lines, or is he really just a terrible actor?  He redeemed himself as his role of a country star in Crazy Heart, so I thought I'd give him another chance.  After Alexander, it's a wonder anyone would watch another Colin Farell movie.  And one last thing about Total Recall, it would have been much better is Kate Beckensdale would have been wearing latex vampire slaying clothes!

Let those tears out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Overall, I loved this book. It was so strong emotionally and physically. Some parts of it were so sad or emotional that I wanted to go and cry in a corner somewhere where no one could see me. I would be sucked into the book and never want to put it down in some spots. It was one of the best books I have ever read and I would recommend it to all mature readers.<br /><br />- Aria Wanek
0316228532|1.0|No humor! No suspense! No plot after 11 % read! Only appalling people! So I stopped reading. If I'd realized this sooner after buying the book, I'd have returned it. I am not sure whether J.K. Rowling wanted to prove that she can ugly, too. So sorry, cause I loved the Potter-series. But maybe I had just wrong expectations.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have only one complaint about this book, and that's that it's not long enough! I love Brandon Sanderson's work. I think he's a phenomenal writer, one of the great fantasy authors of our time, and what makes him so special is his very unique magic systems. The magic system in this story is incredibly interesting and complex.<br /><br />If you're just getting introduced to Brandon Sanderson, this novella and his other short work, Legion, are good places to start. If you love Brandon Sanderson and are waiting for the next Stormlight, Wheel of Time, etc., from him, this will give you a little fix while you wait. Download it. Enjoy it. What have you got to lose?

Please read the other 1 star reviews, they say everything I would say and (unlike Grisham) don't want to waste your time with unnecessary and repetitive information.  Don't buy this book... find a younger and hungrier writer who still cares enough to put out a quality product.

B000JQUZCI|4.0|I was thoroughly surprised at the outcome of this book. When I was younger, people told me about how boring the book was and I definitely trusted their judgement of the novel. I couldn't get into it at the beginning so I read the synopsis. I'd only ever seen \\"Young Frankenstein\\" with my mother so I was thrown off by the story line which proved to be interesting at some (not all) points. I was impressed even though diction was extremely \\"posh\\" and flowery.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|There are many independently published books. Many of these books are not well done for a number of reasons ranging from every paragraph having a typo to just all in all plotless poor storytelling.<br />The Martian was such a relief for me after reading four not so good self published books in the last two weeks. The author kept me throughly engaged, the main character was well developed, it was well written (minor typos exempt) and the details were fascinating. Andy Weir, I hope that this is not the last that we see of you. Personally, I am anxiously waiting for your next work.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found this book very slow reading. I couldn't get into it and finally stopped reading it. I've read other books about Heaven and enjoyed them so much more.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This is an interesting and entertaining movie. I don't like very many movies, but this one kept me interested and involved.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm hooked on these books. Maybe it's the thrill of wanting my very own Christian Grey. It's hard for me to put these books down!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is a really cute game that doesn't take too long to complete.  the levels have increasing complexity which is nice.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Really makes you evaluate your relationship in wondering if you would do the same thing for your spouse. I definitely would for mine!!!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is just pure amazing, it adds so much emotion into it. The story of it is so luring and it hooks you into the game. It makes you think and everything because it has a mystery behind it. In the end, I almost cried because of how beautiful it was. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I debated for months after reading good and bad reviews about these books and decided at least it would give me something to talk about. I couldn't put them down. I read them, 3 books in 3 days. At times it was corny and somewhat grose, but I just couldn't stop reading. Deviant fantasies I guess.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I got this for half price and I like it. It fits the kindle fire as that's what it's made for.<br />I would recommend this product. I got it in a timely fashion as well.
B007M45PMU|2.0|I really LOVE Mumford and Sons CDs and this CD was recommended as a similar genre.  I haven't given the CD much time but at first listen - it is so less musical, so less professional when I compare it to the two Mumford and Sons CDs.  Maybe I will grow to like it, but so far I don't - at all, sorry to say.
B009O07NDY|5.0|More great Howard Shore music!  My daughter likes how it resembles the middle earth music from the Lord of the Rings series and yet is new and exciting.  This version has more of the movie songs, such as &#34;Blunt the Knives&#34; than the version sold as the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.
0385344333|1.0|Oh Lee Childs, where are you? I can not believe you put your name on this uninspired book. It is boring and has no Jack Reacher action at all. I have all your books but i noticed a couple of books before this one that your style is changing. Something is changing, and I think the end is near for Jack Reacher but if so then at least let him go out like a man. Like he was at the start of his adventures, smart, unafraid and gloriously male!
B009ME47H2|3.0|worked on my kindle fire hd so over all i was happy with it used it only one time it was free
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Movie got here very quickly and was in great shape.  I really liked the movie as someone who ran home from school to watch Dark Shadows it brought back great memories. Johnny Depp always a keeper.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I own the Marware Axis. The below comment is about the improvement in this case.<br /><br />The Marware Revolve case improves upon the Marware Axis case. The Axis main feature that drew complaints was ou had to have the case open to charge the Kindle Fire HD. This is fixed with the Revolve now that you can rotate the Kindle 180 degrees instead of 90 degrees previously.<br /><br />Looks like this case may still have the issue of the Kindle Clamshell holder trying to flip away from the case when using the handstrap.<br /><br />The other thing to be aware of is this case and the Axis are quite bulky and about double the weight of carrying the Kindle Fire HD. I personally like it. The case and the Kindle Fire HD together is about 1\\" or so thick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is absolutely addicted to this game!  I can't keep him off of my Kindle!  If you love to build and create, this is for you!  Only thing I DON'T like about it, it's a bit touchy.  You can end up placing items randomly where you don't want them while just moving around.  My son is so adept at manuevering around the game though, that this does not seem to slow him down or bother him too much.
1400067820|5.0|I wonder how ready the world is to head his advice, because in the short term profits, rewards etc. will be higher choosing the fragile road instead of the antifragile road. People/companies aren't very good at sacrificing short-term rewards for longer term gains. However nothing stops you from implementing his ideas in your own life and reaping huge benefits from it. Buy and read this book!
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I could relate to this book because I was the guy who had a knack for getting on base, but coaches overlooked for 'better looking' players. Have an open mind when reading this book and you will enjoy it.
B002FFVF1G|5.0|This is another Hollywood Classic that is a must see.  Full of stars Dorris Day, Rock Hudson, Tony Randall, and full of humor.  The chemistry between the actors is pure magic.  This is a movie the whole family can enjoy together.
B002413TY2|2.0|This was a misfire for me. I love a good action movie, but this one crossed dangerously into the ridiculous, almost self-parody, at times. The love interest, who was supposed to be free-spirited and adorable, was seriously irritating. Very few of the action sequences really played to Statham's strengths--he's most convincing as a brawler or doing work with guns, not as a guy who is really good at riding a bike. The action set-pieces all came off as over-choreographed. I was glad to see the return of the detective character, but little else about this movie clicked with me. A shame to end a fun series on this note.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Something having to do with Star Wars & he likes legos was suggested for Christmas gift.  Your selections are the greatest & I was able to incorparate both in one super gift,
1478230096|3.0|The book provides a good overview of Les Mis, but it was annoying to read because of all the typos and grammatical errors.  It needs some serious editing.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Thought this was a very good present for my wife, she loves it. Will look to purchase more seasons and other also.
B002WY65VU|5.0|and an excellent price! With Zombies all the rage and Twinkies out of existence, this movie will provided hours of entertainment.
B00A83PFW2|5.0|When my daughter who's six started asking for Monster High dolls for Christmas, I checked them out and decided they were a good choice.  They can pose and move better than stiff old Barbie (and MUCH better than the Princess dolls).  In fact, I like the dolls so much that I bought not one, but two.<br /><br />My daughter and I both love Ghoulia!  Her hair is beautiful, her face is quite winsome.  It is good to see a pretty girl wearing glasses.<br /><br />I bought this doll on Ebay. Check there before you pay the Amazon price.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I \\"heart\\" amazon streaming but....there are a LOT of movies like this one that should be 50 cent streaming rentals on day one...can't figure why the FTC doesn't get after amazon's crazy streaming pricing for movies that really should be under a dollar rentals...how does pricing for flops compete with redbox? Seems a little \\"non market based control of pricing\\" if you ask me.  Just my 2 centimes...I know studios need support for greenlighting stinkfests like this...CA needs jobs too :-) but jiminies...
1613823444|1.0|I expected to receive the same edition shown in the picture, but instead received a very low quality, older version. It was a gift and I was very unhappy about the bait and switch!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica mars is of the best shows out there. I really hope they make a movie! I highly recommend to anyone.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|It's the best, they're happy,and on top of their game! I only wish I could have been there! If you are a Led Zeppelin fan you will love this CD/DVD combo!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars is a fantastic tv show. Season 2 is by far my favorite. Both the writing and acting are amazing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a great app for my children. They have fun with it. I would certainly recommend this app for any young child who loves star wars.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The Scarpetta series is my favorite of this author.  This one was a little overly involved with the main characters in there personal lives.  I don't like it when they pick on Marino as he is one of my favorite characters and he is always getting the rotten end of the stick.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This is a fun app for my little boy. He has fun with it. I would certainly recommend this app for a young boy who loves batman.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|Brilliant design, compact and convenient, just wonder how long will it last? Hope it survives in my keychain and in my pocket
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great app for my children. They have fun with it. I would certainly recommend this app for any young child.
1478230096|5.0|So I decided that THIS TIME- before going to watch Les Mis I am going to educate myself about the story.  Just finished it last night so am now ready to make the plunge.  Great book- super easy to understand and everything is crystal clear!
B00457WZEI|5.0|I really liked this one.  I found myself laughing and crying throughout the  book.  I am so glad they made a movie.  I can't wait to read Farm Horse as well.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|We rented this on New Year's Eve to pass the time until Midnight.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend it for very young watchers, due to the heavy use of the F-word.<br /><br />But entertaining all the same.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  Lyra's adventures and discoveries were fun to read. She is quite the character in her speech and mannerisms.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|A must see movie, one that you probably won't see on regular TV in it's entirety, unless you have cable.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  It's especially fun when I need to take my frustrations out on something.  I love smacking the blocks and pigs.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Still holds it's own with some of today's blockbusters - can't believe my 62 year old girlfriend NEVER saw this!!<br />First-rate performances from Swayze, Goldberg, & Moore.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not what I normally read, but loved it!  I was afraid it would be a YA mushball romance and it was so much better!  I finished it in less than 24 hours because I couldn't put it down.  I need a Holder of my very own.  Every woman does!  Seriously dark and romantic all at the same time.  I cried, which doesn't normally happen unless I'm reading Nicholas Sparks.  Just a great, tragic, terrible, amazing, realistic, sexy love story.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Can't believe we actually sat thru this dud.  No wonder it flopped at the box-office.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend, unfortunately, the special effects are 20 years behind times.<br /><br />Low budget to be sure.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Interesting read that stays with you. Quite riveting. Ending was a bit predictble, but a most enjoyable book to read.
B00723NWJE|2.0|Leave this beautiful woman's voice alone.  Every song had too much reverb or processing.  I own everything she's recorded and this is my least favorite.  Hell, you even over processed the cover. I had heard an earlier live recording from New York and thought this would contain the same sound and songs but, nope. I won't give up
B00782O7IY|4.0|Great depiction of a silent movie based on life.  Great use of make-up and costumes.  The dog should have been nominated for a special academy award.
B004I7IPL2|1.0|I did not even finish watching this rental due to the poor streaming quality. I was also not able to rent the movie made prior to this, so viewing it was out of order from the series.
B005CRPB0U|5.0|I love all of  J.K. Rowling's works, I<br /> only wish there were more stories to keep reading!! I suggest this book for sure!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing Temple Run.  I'm not that good yet but that's what keeps me coming back.  I like that I can get booster with the coins I earn so I don't feel like I'm missing out since I don't buy the coins.  There are set goals which get harder the further you advance.  This is game I can't play in public cause I'm so vocal when I smash into a tree trunk, jump into the ocean, or am set on fire!  Doh!! I love it and highly recommended it!  Let's hear it for free games-woo hoo!
B0034G4OYA|3.0|I saw Paranorman, Franken weenie and then this movie in the theatre.<br /><br />This movie was nothing in comparison to the other two.<br />It was not that funny.  But cute.<br /><br />Not the BEST one out there right now.<br /><br />but that is just my opinion.  Paranorman is just really amazing.<br />Sorry.<br /><br />Having said that, my 9 year old cannot stop watching it...so maybe we should let the kids fill out these silly reviews.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I loved American Horror Story season 1.  Season 2 is equally suspenseful and twisted, but it lacks the strong personal link to the characters that Season 1 had.  It's about an institution rather than a family, and then it takes you out of the institution as well.  Season 1 had that thick, sort of magnifying-glass atmosphere; Season 2 is more like a traditional horror movie.  But hey, it's a matter of preference.  Season 2 is still better than most shows in its genre!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This  book is wonderful. It is an extreme cliff hanger on every page. I finished  it in one week! You just can't put it down!!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Dark Shadows was a nifty little film, with all the requisite Johnny Depp moments (he's the reason I saw it to begin with.)  I expected Helena Bonham Carter to have a much bigger role, but she was still good.  The other characters are somewhat shallow, and the ending forced.  See it if you've got time and money to spare.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game and all but some loser today erased all my stuff on my kindle and I would like to get all my game and memory back but I know that it is gone. but I saw today that I can get joyride back thought game circle so I hit that and all my jetpack joyride memory was there but it did not give my my high scores and stuff and it did not give me my stuff back in the game what do I do I want to play jetpack joyride agian. D:
B003L77GRO|5.0|Perfection perfection perfection. Dexter is always perfection, and this season is consistent in its perfection.  The ending is insane, but less so if you've read the books.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Like most of her albums, her style and music has evolved and this album is no different. Its catchy and more upbeat :)
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Having only seen lesser versions of this in local theater and growing up with the music around, I watched this movie having no real expectations. The music was well done. I wouldn't be able to tell which songs were missing. I noticed that during a lot of the songs, it was just a close up on the actor singing it the whole time. I found that stylistic choice strange, but at the same time, it was nice to see the emotion close up in the actor's face. That is something you don't get if you are sitting fifty feet away from the performer in the musical play. The movie got through Hugh Jackman's character's story well. But I didn't find myself terribly compelled by his adopted daughter's love story with the young revolutionist. I don't know if it is developed more in the musical, but I really did not care about their relationship at all. Now a note on the PG-13 rating: It definitely deserved the PG-13 rating it received. The sexual content mentioned in the mpaa rating is actually more graphic than you'd expect. There are two sex scenes where it is very clear what is going on. So you might want to think about that if you are taking younger kids. Also the violence was mostly bloodless and implied, however, you do see a lot of blood on the ground and in the gutter after the battle. Overall, the movie was worth watching with good music. Hugh struggled to hit a few high notes though. I won't be rushing out to see it again, but I am glad I watched it.
0316776963|5.0|Its funny and not anything that I would expect. I found his storylines had many undertones and it was hilarious and heartbreaking at times. A wonderfully entertaining book based on David Sedaris' life.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|When I saw this in theaters, I mostly enjoyed it, but I found myself disturbed and I was taken out of the movie experience when the shooting in the laboratory part happened. I stopped being entertained at that point and was soberly reminded of recent shootings all over the country very similar to the one portrayed in the movie. The rest of the movie was enjoyable and I laughed at how unstoppable the really stylish bad guy at the end was. Overall, I enjoyed the theatrical experience other than that one scene that took me out of it. Having stewed on it for a few months, I came to admire the boldness of the inclusion of that scene. I was moved by the fact that because of recent events and the plausibility of a shooting like the one in the movie it was included. It just made the story more believable. So while that scene is still hard to watch, I can respectfully admire the point it is trying to get across. As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the audio was a blast to listen to. I love it when normal scenes take advantage of surround sound in addition to the action scenes. I felt completely immersed in the movie. The picture quality was great and the film grain was intact the whole time. As far as the extras are concerned, I watched every last bit of them. The audio commentary was worth a listen, but I won't be returning to it any time soon. The participants talked over each other a lot and also alluded to a lot of personal anecdotes without really going into what they meant. But, it was also really informative on certain scenes, especially the scene at Marta's house. I found about half of the commentary very interesting and the other half was nonsense. The rest of the special features were great, their only downfall being that there are not more of them. That said, the best buy exclusive disc did not have anything that compelled me to get that version. It seemed like mostly fluff stuff. So if anyone has that version, they should post what they think of the exclusive content. Overall, worth the purchase. It holds up well to repeat viewings and the Blu-ray is top notch. Make sure and watch the deleted scenes, they add some nice flavor. As far as PG-13 content goes, this movie earned it for a bunch of violence and some language. I would preview it before showing it to younger kids, due to the disturbing nature of a few of the scenes (what the people try to do to Marta at her house, and the laboratory shooting in particular). On a final note, this movie fits in perfectly with the other Bourne movies. Enjoy and thanks for reading!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This movie has it all, a lot of twists and turns, adventure, action, mystery, drama, and a strong storyline. If you liked the first Sherlock Holmes this one is arguably better than the first. Robert Downey Jr. is funny and entertaining, along with Jude Law. They are both versatile actors that work well together enhancing the storyline. Can't go wrong :)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie BRAVE movie was great. Action, adventure, and funny. Good for the whole family. Would recommend to everyone. Purchase worthy.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The Dark Knight Triology all combined into one box. I got it as a gift for Christmas. I was available on Prime and I got it for only 16 bucks. Awesome movies, a great addition to any action/ drama dvd collection. Amazing storylines, performances, and vision from Christopher Nolan. If you liked Inception and Memento, this would be enticing to watch and even better to own.
B007SGM084|1.0|I choose this rating because this is not a book I would recommend.  The language for me personally is not something I choose to read. I did try but I can't go along with reading something that every page is worse then the last.  And to think our young people have access to such trash.  I chose it because I love to read about the PNW which makes for an interesting story, but as I got into it I was very disappointed with the content.<br /><br />Being a best seller this is just my opinion, I can see where most have found this book a good read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was a fun book, it paints vivid pictures of the story through photographs and the characters. I enjoyed it for its peculiar style and its entertainment value. I am excited to read the next part of this series. The writing is very simple, and uncomplicated, has a few twists and turns, but lacks depth if that is what you are looking for. Take a chance, be pleasantly surprised like I was. Enhance your reading experience through photographs.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was captured by his experience. Didn't like the ending. Would have hoped he would have presented a Christian rather than an interfaith conclusion.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I was introduced to Passenger through a recommendation from a friend and I love his accent mixed with his soothing folky voice. I can't seem to get enough. Great lyrics too :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved the book. Didn't know what to expect with it being free but it was great. Can't wait to read more!
B000P5FH3K|3.0|I am just updating my DVD collection.  I have already seen this and read the book.  I won't watch it again for a while.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Overall great product, i do love this film. Video quality was great as well as audio, well worth the buy.
B007SPPANM|4.0|I had the movie on VHS.  I am just updating my collection on DVD.  I didn't watch the DVD again yet.
0743244257|5.0|This is a great book. Eric really makes you analyze the world, which I can relate to very much! Don DeLillo is a great author!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The soundtrack is the &#34;film&#34;<br />I love it.  It's done well and a bargain deal too.<br />Enjoy this is the car or in your home.....<br />Very relaxing
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Our 4, 7, and 10 year olds loved it.  Easy to like as a parent too.  I would even watch it even without them.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love pudding monsters, accually my sister bought it before me and I thought it whould stupid but I was wrong its fun I can have hours of addicting game play, free! so, if your looking for a fun interactive game that's free and costs nothing cause you bought to many Taylor swift songs, (me)  go with pudding monsters all the way!
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Like all of Aimee Mann's music, it is enjoyable, thought provoking, and a pleasure to listen to over and over.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I enjoy the music it has a slight country vibe but all in all it is an excellent choice. I would recommend this for a wide variety of people. Even those, like myself, who do not enjoy country music.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|&#34;Santa&#34; brought my almost 3-year-old son this loader and the &#34;Bruder Tipping Trailer With Grey Sides&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OE4NW8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_2) for Christmas.  This was definitely one of his favorite gifts.  The backhoe was fun for him until he realized he could switch it out for the included trailer hitch and pull the trailer around.  I'm sure the backhoe will get more use in the summer when he can dig in the sand with it.  The plastic used is solid and looks like it should hold up to sandbox play.  It also has all sorts of moving parts that will be fun to tinker with.  We're likely going to buy more in the series for his birthday.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I gave it as a gift and the receivor was very excited and couldn't wait to listen to it on Christmas.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Loved this book! Great deal for the price! Very exciting! If you<br />Like adventure get this book right  right now!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I'm not a music critic, but I know what I like when I hear it. Beth Hart's voice and Joe Bonamassa's guitar playing are superb and really make a great combination. Beth's songs as well as her interpretations of songs from Billie Holiday and Melody Gardot (to name two that I know) display her range as well as her unique delivery. I do not get tired of listening to her.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I haven't read a book outside of college texts in a long while so I was looking for something that was not only easy to read but one that would bring back the enjoyment of reading. This book did both!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Like most others I discovered Lindsey Stirling on YouTube. Her talent is exceptional and she is as fun to watch as she is to listen to. I love the beats and the combination of the different types of music. Until Amazon fulfills this album itself, I would recommend purchasing her songs/album off of her website.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a good friend and coworker. From the title, I was truly expecting a light read. I was caught off guard by the emotions this story evoked and I am pleasantly surprised by how quickly I became involved in the lives of these characters. What a wonderful book.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Is this really what it boils down to? I fear that my will to live is dying slowly with each and every app like this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This WORKS!  It is so much better than using the<br />Yahoo web version of e-mail. I recommend this app without hesitation.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I bought this for my 14 yo b'day.  He could not stop working on this Lego.  Once he started, he pushed through till the end.  When he opened the box, laid all the pieces out, and started the instructions, the Shuttle started to take shape.<br /><br />Nicely done.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Though I wasn't going into the movie expecting much, I thought this movie was far below even the low expectations I had for it.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|A good movie that keeps moving, keeps your attention and has an interesting story line.  I would definitely watch it again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a fun and very interesting game it takes time but it is still fun if you just play like an hour a day or something but its fun my friends and I play it all the time
0679405496|3.0|I'm seriously conflicted about this book. Is it a masterfully told tale of complicated characters and compelling moral conundrums and gray areas? Yes. Intellectually, I appreciate it very much. But . . . I just. don't. like. it. And mostly I don't like it because I couldn't help feeling that Forster didn't much like it either. He wrote his characters, even the sympathetic ones, with borderline disdain. It's rather a grumpy book, for all its brilliance, and so I find I'm as glad to be done with it as I am to have read it.
0375851569|5.0|Every child should read these or have them read to them. My granddaughter loves them and so does my grandson.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well its more fun to play and a lot of my other friends are as much addicted to it as I am. and I'm glad its free because I wanted to get Tempe run brave but its 0.99 and I like free so I don't have to ask anyone. this is the best game ever!!!!!!!
0525478817|5.0|Alright, so I admit that I only bought this because I wanted to check this John Green dude out, but man, this was a great book. In fact, I read it in one day because I could not make myself put the book down. It's phenomenal. It's philosophical. It's heartbreakingly brilliant. A must read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was definitely hard to put down!  I loved ever page of it!  Now I just need to find another book that can keep me glued like this one. :)
0307744434|5.0|Two WORDS: Magical and Fantastic! Erin Morgenstern did a wonderful job! The plot and the characters interact with each other. It was really romantic! And I just love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Didn't think I would care for it since the characters are younger but I really enjoyed all the twists and turns. Very heartwarming at times.
1455523550|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic! Nicholas Sparks wrote the book with emotions and setting. It has a wonderful plot and characters. This book is well-written as the other books that he wrote..But it was love story with a suspenseful twist which made it entertaining to read. Also I'm excited to watched the movie when it comes out and I totally recommend this book.
B007XF0X6G|5.0|I only rate the 3-D in the Blu-ray format and this is in comparison to Clash of the Titans. The clarity and use in this film is much better though I did have to adjust my digital audio to get clear voice's .
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|When I try to view the jobs board from my Kindle Fire, it forces me to log in again, but when I type it won't show. Fix this app and fix it now.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This is the first time I purchased a complete season but I feel it was worth it. I have collected Dr. Who since the 70s and have at least some of every who. I had been watching them in order as I do about the holiday season every year and my collection stopped in the 5th.
B008469DGY|4.0|Flick Golf is a fun game.  I can take it with me while I wait for<br />appointments and enjoy it at home.
B00475BUVM|5.0|This is not the best 3-D that's for certain but if you like this film in 2-D DVD as I do then there is a lot of detail you will discover with it in Blu-ray 3-D that will make it seem like a different film. The digital sound too has something to add to the experience .
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is well made and fun and interesting to play.  I am happy that I tried this app and recommend it.
B006O6F932|2.0|My daughter wanted this playset so badly. It is really cute but not woth the $$$.  It retails for $109.00 Cdn.  I am completely disappointed with the quality of the product.  It is very flimsy and cheaply made.  Definitely not worth the price.  If I had the opportunity to have seen it before purchasing I doubt I would have paid half the retail price.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game and would love to play it all day if we allowed him too!<br /><br />Very well made game!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|WE all need to believe some times. A simple message, but profound. Pop some popcorn, gather your family around, and enjoy.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|A nice entertaining movie about flying with so good fight scenes. I think there should have been some more action, but in the long run it was a good movie.
B004WR125O|3.0|I bought the Onkyo TX-8050 and the UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter together. After setup the Onkyo sounded great. After entering in all the correct information for the UWF-1 it recognized my router. Having a Pandora account, it recognized Pandora, but could not make/keep a connection. The signal strength was only around 28%. Not that good. Regardless of what I did, I could not improve on the signal strength. I wound up returning the UWF-1 Lan Adapter to Amazon. No problem there. Amazon was great about the return, as always.<br /><br />P.S. I still have the Onkyo, it sounds great, even without the LAN Adapter.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was hoping for a great read but sure didn't find it. Too many uninteresting characters and a head-shaker plot/story. I finished with grim determination and the ending was in-line with the rest of the book. Boring. She can do better than this!
B00338QENI|2.0|Could have been a good story, but weighed down in endless detail.  Deperately needed some editing. Too much scientific information.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Wonderful app easy to use with percentages. Not glitchee or full of carp you don't need to use. Straightforward calculator.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|I like the music and it was in good condition. It has a good beat and easy to dance to
B00899F0G8|5.0|Bought this for my teen daughter, she loves this show. She highley recommends this series. We will be getting others also.
B0091LS07E|3.0|ONLY HADE 2 SONGS I LIKED FROM  SOME ONE OF HER RECORD!!IF I HAd HEARD IT EARLIER I WOULDNT BOUGHT IT.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I have been an Incubus fan for many years and yes, their sound was very different on \\"If Not Now, When?\\", but lyrically still just as amazing as all their previous albums. I rarely listen to the radio because I think most music today lacks depth along with enjoyable music to go with lyrics that make you think. Incubus along with a few selective bands out there today, is one of my exceptions. I'm aware that compared to other albums that some songs are slow aka elevator music but again, listen to the lyrics and it is still good ol' Incubus.<br /><br />My favorite songs are on this album are \\"Promises, Promises\\", \\"Isadore\\", \\"Defiance\\", \\"If Not Now, When, and \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" (although I have no idea what the song is about in the slightest!). Only song I found myself skipping has been \\"Friends and Lovers\\". I like the beat of the song, but I'm not feeling the lyrics. \\"Switchblade\\" also is one of those songs that sometimes I love it when I have a lot of energy, or skip on my way to work (hah).<br /><br />This was probably my favorite album I have bought from recent years but again I hardly buy any albums!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|The movie arrived in time but the movie is terrible. The story is not well written and the music is terrible.
B00021R7CG|5.0|this was a christmas present for my husband and it was just as he remembered it.  it was delivered in time for christmas.  it met my husbands expectations.
0345803485|1.0|I'm a late reader of this author's book, and I knew the woman writing this was trying to be something...she is clearly not...an experienced, serious writer.  This comes from one who is seeking to be published, true, and yet, I tapped my Kindle's \\"next page\\" button throughout the whole 20+ chapters of this \\"primer\\" type of pulp fiction.<br /><br />No only were the exclamations elementary school in level, (Holy crap!  Holy tie!  Holy carabine!) but to appeal to most women who are buying pop books currently as they hit Best Seller's list, at least a 30-year-old woman should be making her mark in the BDSM forum, not a virgin.  For God's sake, any man of his age and stature who takes the virginity of a college graduate for his naughty pleasures, after having older women as teachers is either too sick to take seriously or feel anything but disgust for (as a reader) or is atypically cruel when it comes to women, any woman!<br /><br />I truly had time to kill, and after reading this, I am more hopeful I shall publish my contemporary romance surely, since this piece of work (I cannot say art) is stamped on pages between two hard copies.  Let's think first, ladies, before we indulge in some state-of-art literature.<br /><br />My excuse for the ebook buy?  My sister wanted my opinion.<br /><br />We both agree on our reviews...don't waste $9.99 on a Kindle or more in print, and look for MY book in Summer of 2013!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An instant classic.  This is one of the best young adult books there is. And for $3.99 (kindle version) you can't go wrong.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's really fun.but the no matter what if something big goes to the side you can't save it unless you get coin walls!!!!!!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|This down tempo follow up to the self titled debut is an ambient journey kissing standard pop themes with drum and bass accents.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The story was good enough to keep me reading but the attention to detail isn't as good as the first books of this series.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|This album is a great way to transition from the deep cut Ready for the Weekend to the new commercially successful 18 Months.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I had high hopes when I rented this movie and was really looking forward to it. But alas, my hopes were quashed...<br />The movie starts slow and doesn't give you a story to allow you to relate to the characters or even care about them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie not only starts slow it stays slow for almost its entirety. It only gets interesting near the end during the chase where you suddenly remember that this is supposed to be an action movie!<br /><br />As for the movie's conclusion, only 5 minutes after the one and only chase... it's a complete let down. You don't get any closure nor do you feel that you can't wait for the sequel like other movies have done.<br /><br />This is just a blah movie and in retrospect, I should've just waited for it to come out on cable. Don't waste your money
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book. I have always loved the series. It has a love story, adventure, everything you could want in a book. I can't wait for the next one.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This s one of the best books I've read all year! I'm a voracious reader so this is a really great book, so creative and unusual! Read it immediately!
1400052173|5.0|I found this book very interesting, especilly since I was raised in Baltimore and John Hopkins Hospital is a revered institution.  Sometimes the Doctors don't tell us all we need to know.  In this case it proved to be an outstanding discovery and error at the same time.
B009186JYI|5.0|Arrived fast and in perfect condition.  Great eary recording of Stones concert.  Interesting to see early reaction to the Stones right satisfaction hit the charts.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I can't begin to say how excellent this album is!  I am not doing a review, I don't do reviews.  If you are an Anthrax fan - or even just getting to know them - get this!!!
B006O6F932|5.0|The girls were so excited to get this for Christmas!!! I was surprised at all the details in this playset! Definitely recommend this toy if your kids are Monster High Fans like mine are!
B000N6TX22|4.0|Love this movie, kind of long and boring at certain points but overall i like it a lot which is why I purchased it. Cool concept.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I PLAYED the PC version and it was Ok but my friend got it for his iPod and said it was better so I got it and it was much better. I have already beaten so much on it. Buy it because it's amazing.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing the entire book! Coming to the end of the book really made me sad. Ellen is funny and heart warming.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app has been great. It's better than the Facebook app with the faster energy increase and a faster way to earn money. I would recommend this app highly to anyone who loves building cities.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The book makes one realize the importance of \\"the present time\\" and the precious memories accumulated along the journey of \\"living\\".
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best p&p. Hands down. Even my kids want to marry Darcy after watching this. Im not going to say its the closest to the book but its definatly a favorite
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Nice sounds, I don't feel like I need more to relax. Only problem I've had was you can't listen while you do something else but I guess that's kind of the point
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. The dubbing is a bit off but you get caught up and dont notice it that much.This is a movie that becomes a tridition to watch
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Descent movie, but has a lot of bad language. Has its funny parts, and watching the bears sexual animations was the best part.
B000A5044C|5.0|I tried to find this movie for a long time, in Canada, where I live but, it was impossible. I really loved it.
B000002KB8|5.0|I've listened to this every since i was little. this CD is perfect for me, Ozzy is my favorite artist of all time.
B0016MZFXS|5.0|The item was cute it works and I gave it to a foreign exchange student and the instructions were in his language.  Was not planned but worked great.  I think it gave him a touch of home
B000002KDO|5.0|I've listened to this every since i was little. this CD is perfect for me, Ozzy is my favorite artist of all time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game download it I can say it is the best Sim I have played so far it has everything you could be looking for in a Sim game
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really enjoy this version, especially the music.  I wish I could change my character picture, but cannot figure it out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just what I was looking for! I was looking for an app to read my bible through in one year and that's exactly what I found! I like that it keeps up with the dates and what I have read. Super easy to use on my I phone and kindle :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Quite possibly the best book I've ever read!  This book is riveting!  Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I had loved the Bourne movies, but this one was just horrid. Bad  and confusing script.Stay away from this one.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think being the zombies is hard because the enemy  archers have guns and I have no charms. But the grafics are great.I like how they gave you that game where u shoot those balls and get all of those coins charms and such
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book, I hope she continues the series, plenty of storyteller to tell!  Thanks for the wild ride Ms. Collins
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's a book that makes you want more and makes you wish you could be right in there helping them. Recommend to anyone!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Well written, I can't put it down.  Get the book to add to the fun of watching the TV series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Got my son a Kindle Fire for Christmas. He's let me play with it about three times now. This is the first game I got to play on it. I'm addicted!! It's a great game!! Gonna put it on my Kindle Fire HD I ordered!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have had fun playing the game and the less time the better your score.<br />You are competing with your own scores
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Entertaining, poignant, hilarious all in one book. Great story with applications to anyone's life. Very enjoyable book, highly recommend especially if you love dogs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wanna play games that make you feel like a kid again .... well lookno more just fun time killers I wanna bet aall the games
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I love the three main stars in this show but all that talent just wasn't enough to save this movie. Too bad.
B000SXMNI6|5.0|This is one of the Must Have albums of all time! To say &#34;timeless&#34; is an understatement. many of the songs would not sound out of place is a mid evil castle nor blasting from your living room, Buy It! Listen to it!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was an amazing book! If it weren't so long, I'd read it all over again!!! This book is the sequel to Maze Runner, and I suggest that you should . read that book first if you're thinking of reading this one.  All of this series of books are the books that are the definition of adventure! I hope that if you're gonna read this that you will have as much fun as I did!
B009RH973I|5.0|Love the slim line - the only problem with the old style was being unable to plug it in when it was closed, but the style has been slightly modified and the problem has been resolved. Would recommend to anyone!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|True Clancy form!  Always my favorite!  Layers upon layers of international action, intrigue and vivid character development.  I always look forward to his new releases.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|.  This is battery operated toy with a remote and produces a little light.  I bought this because it looked interesting and my son is fascinated with space.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Played this while in college and its been a few years, just picked it up again and it is still a<br />great game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app that I've found.  It's fast on the Kindle, from the time I turn the Kindle on, to a weather screen is about 15 seconds.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|This was a captivating story. I liked the setting and the use of native tribes, especially showing their viewpoint. I don't know if the whales were CGI or actual filming but you can't tell the difference.<br /><br />This movie presents both sides of controversial issues and then shows how people can still co-operate to achieve something no one thought possible. The adversaries are oil companies vs. Green Peace, native Eskimos vs. Save the Whales, youth vs. elders trying to teach traditional skills, politicians vs. military, U.S. vs. USSR, and news vs. egotistic media.
1423140605|5.0|i liked it because the ordering was easy.and it arrived even before the estimated date.as does most things that I order .
B0054R6BFM|5.0|One of the most fascinating books I have read in a long while. Can't wait to see the movie adaptation.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I really enjoyed the first two movies in this series, and it's no different with Dark Knight Rises.  I enjoyed it even more after watching it for a second time.  This one is probably worth adding to your collection.
033046406X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is an awesome storyteller. You realize why he's been on the top of his game for such a long time.<br /><br />I know a few people have given negative reviews to this book claiming that it is not realistic enough. That's probably true but then again, I read this book with a mind to get entertained. And entertain it did. It had me turning the pages obsessively and at one point even had me whooping with delight as the villains get their comeuppance. The court room drama scenes really make this book memorable.<br /><br />Overall, a fine Sunday read.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I made it through about a half hour of the movie. It was juvinile...I felt like I was in junior high again. Skip it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|An intregal part of the hunger Games Trilogy but it seemed a bit like as the book progressed the author was taking sort cuts toward the ending. Would have liked more detail in some of the events and transitions for Katnis.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app! I have it on all my devices, but I love it best on my kindle fire.  It is entertaining and easy to use.  I recommend it to everyone young or old.
0525423656|4.0|i read a lot of reviews on this series and a lot of the reviews were a little upsetting to me after finishing the first book. i loved this book as the second book in this series. i loved it because it showed growth in both the characters and the story itself while the story was continued. i was concerned that i would be upset that the main characters were no longer side by side learning about one another. But i wasn't. it was fitting that they were not together. it was fitting that instead they were surviving and searching for each other, all the while learing about themselves and the reader slowly took in more pieces of the story. i did miss out on the story of xander, but i do understand that ky and cassia are the focus and i understand why.<br /><br />i would recommened this book. i loved the feeling of mystery. i'm very good at figuring things out and this one had me guessing a bit, or more like wondering where we would end up.<br /><br />very good.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This is an excellent CD of this band.  The one disappointment was that the band decided to release 3 different versions of the album and this one doesn't include a song that was a &#34;must have&#34; for my daughter.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really find this app very helpful.  It tells the area weather and gives a15 day forecast.  This is typical for this type of app.  But, I like that it tells you how the weather will affect your health, conditions for sports/outdoor activities and has video of your local forecast.  Like this app a lot.
0593070631|5.0|My daughter is a HUGE McFly fan (discovered them on YouTube) and this was the top of her wish list for Christmas.  The book didn't disappoint.  It have quite a few pictures as well as the text.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It is a very good product, makes using the Kindle comfortable and protects product very well, I do recommend it highly!
B009PLKPMS|5.0|Great collection of this British band's music creations to date.  I just wish we could get their music released and sold in the US but the British distributors do an amazing job getting the CD's quickly to the states.
B008K8X0IS|3.0|The blu ray packaging was nice<br />The episodes should be good<br />I would have given this 5 Stars if it was worth it to pay more for this edition and its not worth it.<br />The collectible dragon egg paperweight was half finished junk and looked like a preschooler made it<br />You do get episode one of next season<br />I probably won't pay any extra money for next season to get a &#34;collectible&#34; edition
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I missed the first four segments of this season and watching it on Amazon was an expensive easy way to catch up. I watched it on my Roku and computer, so if you need to catch up or want to re-watch episodes then start now.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Bingo Blitz is a lot of fun, but I don't like to play games that require payment.  There's plenty of free games available that I will play instead.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I bought this for my other half and she loved it as a Christmas present.  The item shipped on time and it is a great movie.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is my favorite mahjong game.  I think any mahjong fan will like this one. Try it and you'll see.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There are points where I could not put the book down. I had to force myself to sleep or eat or go to work, but it was worth it and left me wanting more. A hunger I had not known.<br />As great as Katniss is- smart, keen, sharp, beautiful,- she can be super oblivious to the most basic clues.<br />I'm realizing the more I read this series the more I believe that girls don't know what their hearts or mind wants. Katniss is every girl. Or at least... every girl we want (or want to be).<br />I look forward to the next 3 days where I sit and finish this series.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I suppose I'll like it a lot once I get it working.  I love looking at handmade items that people post.
B000URDCC6|5.0|I did not watch this movie myself but it was given as a gift and she did absolutely love it.
B009YJEKJK|5.0|I love their singing together and the causes they support!  IT makes you want to sing with them and puts a smile on your face!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Fun fun fun!!!! Great read exciting plot twists... not to keen on the main characters being brother and sister. That's kind of like finding out Bella and Edward are related here is hoping it's just another great plot twist!!
B000WGWQG8|4.0|We watched this series several years ago when it first came out on dvd but we didn't use the on screen historical guide. This time we did. Very informative guide. The acting is excellent as are the sets. Very convincing and probably a lot more accurate than the history I read as a kid in grade school. Highly recommended viewing.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|This triple set is awesome British Blues circa 1968... Along with the &#34;Blues Jam at Chess&#34; with Willie Dixon and Otis Spann this is the best document of Peter Green's blues guitar and vocals. I put him in a class with only  John Mayall and Eric Clapton as his peers in that 1960s British Blues scene... I believe Fleetwood Mac did 17 studio albums, and these are the first three--very far removed from the Rumours & Buckingham/ Nicks era ... This collection is filled with &#34;Dust my Broom&#34; licks and other blues classics.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|This is a very good one....If you like Norah Jones, this one's definitely for you!  My personal favorites are &#34;Say Goodybe&#34; (love it!), &#34;She's 22&#34;, &#34;Take it Back&#34;, &#34;After the Fall&#34;, &#34;4 Broken Hearts&#34;, &#34;Travelin' On&#34; and &#34;Out on the Road&#34;. Beautiful woman and excellent and enchanting artist. I have a few of her albums, and this is my favorite. &#34;Little Broken Hearts&#34; is good as well...
055357342X|5.0|I'm not a book critic.  I just like to read.  This whole series is entertaining and enthralling.  Couldn't put any of these books down.
B0010X745K|4.0|This was a great movie. A must see for anyone who loves monster movies. I suggest to watch this with surround sound, it's wild!
055358202X|5.0|This series is great.  I'm no book critic, but I think it's as good as any of the classic medieval fantasy series like LOTR or King Arthur.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Nice read..I don't get what all the hype was about. There are other authors with many books on the same line. The way people were raving..I thought this was going to be the best thing since sliced bread..not so!! Still not a bad read, I did get a few chuckles and needed some tissue a time or two!! :)
B003WMX3SY|4.0|This is a great case with lots of configureability and almost too many options. Overall this is a great case and my son loves it!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I saw the previous movies and wanted to continue the story.  I 'm anxious to see the final movie and see how it all ends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I definitely wasn't expecting this story line...I love that I was taken aback, had to have a few \\"chapter breaks\\" -but got right back into it. Great twists and turns!  This book made me stay up and read till 4am...I couldn't put it down.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|I enjoy history.  A recent visit to Gettysburg made me wonder what Hollywood did with the telling of the story.
B004J64QSI|5.0|After having seen a few stage productions of Les Miserables, I saw this production on public television a few years ago and was so impressed for so many reasons, i.e. the quality of the voices, the history of the production and those who  wrote the score and the lyrics and have produced productions ,have performed the major parts, etc., that I ordered it for myself.  After attending the movie with children and older grandchildren (which I thought was excellent but not to be compared with the stage production in any way), I decided to share this production with some of them so they could enjoy the background and amazing singing voices of the performers from stage productions.  I know they will be moved as I am every time I listen to the marvelous and soul shaking music of Les Miserables in a very different way than they saw it in the movie theater.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Nice addition to the Trilogy. Didn't realize that the story line runs parallel with one of the other 'Bourne' movies.
074356619X|5.0|I have been buying The Secret for friends and family for 3 years.  The Secret is meant to be shared.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Second seasons can be such a letdown. Not this one. I'm not a horror/scifi guy so all the more impressive to pull me in. Excellent acting and good subplots. Worth it!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The quality of the video was bad for the first 20-30 minutes of it; it would skip and freeze and the image was very blurry. But after a while of letting it run and buffer, it became more clear and smooth.
B005CKPQNE|3.0|There's no doubt the acting and plot line are excellent. But it just got too heavy and too discouraging to continue. Probably just me but there's just too much art imitating life for me to stay involved.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Big fan of last 3 movies. Somewhat of a letdown. Not a total waste, though. Not a satisfying end to the movie.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Kept my attention and the plot was somewhat believable. I'm a big Bourne fan and Renner did a good job, for sure, but I do miss Matt Daemon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked everything about it! I would recommend it to everyone! I chose this rating because it was amazing! Thanks
B007Z9R69M|5.0|I found the plot to be believable and the acting was surprisingly good. I almost did not get it because it seemed to have that tired constant theme of \\"woman beats the snot out of inept man\\" in that Hollywood wants us to believe that a 110 girl can buttkick a 240 pound gorilla.<br />The fight scenes were truly believable. I kept thinking, \\"I know this girl from somewhere!\\". At one point there was a camera angle that showed these huge biceps/triceps on the lead actress. Good grief, the girl is ripped! It wasn't till the end that I realized it was Gina Carrano, the MMA champion. I surely hope she continues her acting career. No one is more surprised than me that she was a good actor. Yes, yes, the plot had her be a big curmudgeon and she took some hits from critics for playing the role as the director intended. So what.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I look forward to season 3. Falling Skies and The Walking Dead are my favorites. Season 1 was great and season was even better.
B008M36ER0|4.0|I have enjoyed most, but not all, of Gibson's movies. This one was surprisingly good with a bit of humor here and there. Plot was believable and acting was good. Gave me the shivers as we have lived close to the border and have had numerous opportunities to travel into Mexico.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a simplfied Mahjong and the tiles are kind of small on my Kindle Fire HD 7 inch, but the game plays really well.<br />I love Mahjong and I am glad to be able to take it along with me. Price is very right (Free)
B006885LZM|2.0|After seeing Band of Brothers, I was very interested in seeing the other side of the war. Band of Brothers is a masterpiece. I understand how difficult it is to try and document a war fought on so many fronts (islands) for the Pacific theater.  That being said, it was too disjointed and had too many subplots to follow it accurately. I also found the gratuitous sex scenes unnecessary and even unrealistic for that period of time. Of course premarital sex was a reality but popping into bed twenty minutes after meeting someone in 1943 would be more appropriate for 2013. I'm thinking the writers parents were my generation and did not grasp the moral leanings of their grandparents generation. The carnage was true and accurate as well and who would doubt that this was the norm and not the exception. But, jeez, did we need to have so much of it to get the pont across?!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie is great conclusion to the Batman Begins series! It is definitely worth seeing the other movies somewhat prior to watching this finale as a plot refresher, but other than that, a very well-done film.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Got a bit corny and predictable toward the end. Surprised Rotten Tomatoes gave it 67%. Guessing the Weinstein Brothers get a pass on their not-so-great flicks.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a fun, quick game.  The levels run out pretty quickly, but the overall game is fun!  Would definitely recommend!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The whole series is so romantic and enthralling. Plus I love happy endings! I can know watch the movies with knowledge
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read Colleen Hoover's other two books & thought they were amazing....this one didn't disappoint! Love love loved it!!! She's an incredible author!
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Quailty used product.  The disc set travel to me safely and for used materials in almost new condtion.  There is nothing worst then having you DVDs not survive the mail system.  GREAT JOB!
B007REAIUE|5.0|Great 50's vibe. There is a lot of rockabilly out there but this CD captures the real sound of our Rock N' Roll roots.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Album is great and has a sample of most of the singers and the songs you heard while watching the show.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|One of our all time favorites.  The picture quality is clear and have had no problems watching it. Over and over again.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|Received this case and it is a good little case. Zipper and case appear to be very durable and long lasting. The padding in the case is ok but I wish it had alittle more,to protect my kindle Fire HD. All in all a good case that should do the job i need it to do.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Downloaded on the kindle and have had fun playing the game. Its hard to stop sometimes. Most games are like that.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The songs selcted were great and her voice was pitch perfect. This purchase was worth the money. I remain a Susan Boyle fan.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The book was pretty interesting. I enjoyed most of the story especially his story about his time on the boat, but the ending was strange.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Love this series! Excellent writing. I can't put these books down. Actually re- reading the series in anticipation of the next book coming out.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I don't brag often, but when it comes to mystery novels - I usually have the plot figured out by no less than 2/3 of the way through the book.  Not so with this story. Completely threw me for a loop! Definitely worth the read.  Update: Just read this again, and was still engrossed from beginning to end. I rarely read books more than once, but upon wanting to purchase another of Diane Setterfield's books, I wanted to re-acclimate myself with her writing, so I pulled this out of my Kindle cloud. Just as stirring as the first read, with more detail coming to my attention and falling back in love with each of the characters.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|One of the first books i have read that explains crossfit, both theiry and practical.  Provides an excellent array of rountines, progressions and wods for the beginner and the more advanced. Also provides an execellent section on how to design your own workouts.  My only negative is the discrepancy in price between the ebook price of ten dollars versus the hardcopy price of forty dollars ( still worth the cost).
B005LAII8K|5.0|Showed up really quick a very good movie.Bruce willis does a great job of killing himself.I really liked the future singapore
B000W44IZW|5.0|I am a big fan of Jean Reno...I bought this just because he was in it and I was definately not sorry I did!<br />The beginning was a little hard to understand, but as the movie went on...I was mesmerized...it was funny...<br />thought provoking and sad...everything a movie should be.  The scenery was breathtaking! I can't wait to<br />watch this again and again and again...so good I did not want to move for fear of missing even a moment of it..<br />Do yourself a favor and buy it...then find a nice quiet place to watch this by yourself...you will not be sorry...<br />Jean Reno at his best!!!
0061997811|5.0|The book came before the estimated delivery date making me very pleased.  Even though it was the wrong book ordered, on my part, I gave it as a gift to my little sister.  The book was protected by being wrapped and it arrived in great condition even though the box looked as if it had been thrown around a bit.  I didn't receive a receipt should I need returning it but all in all, I'm very happy.
0307346617|5.0|Another interesting view of the Zombie Apocalypse.  Interesting read, would have liked more.  Not a story per se, but accounts of the event as it unfolded told by various survivors in various places.  Will order the next book.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Great movie had me cracking up!!! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a laugh and grew up in the 80's! lol
B008673ZAQ|4.0|***SPOILERS**<br /><br />1st let me just say, I really liked this book it was a really good read, but to be honest i really do not like Gideon and i don't understand why Eva put up with is bs and lets him treat her like crap then say \\"trust me\\" trust my ass!!! that's some serious disrespect in my book. And Eva is like a lost puppy to everything he does jumping at every word he says and being so \\"caught up inlove with Gideon\\" . Don't get me wrong this book is a good read but my feeling towards Gideon make me second guess the book, i was praying and hoping throughout the whole book that Eva would go back to Brent just like how Gideon had got back with Corrine but no Gideon shares a lil of his past and says i love u and she back in the crazy train, that really had irked me, but none the less he started to treat her like crap to so he could............ never mind read the book and find out :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really good motivational story. True story. I am impressed with the verbiage made me want more. Easier said then done great work
B005SFR7YE|5.0|What can one say, got this for the wife for Christmas, watched it that morning. First time I've ever seen the opera. Beautiful DVD
B004QX07G4|5.0|Funny and an easy read. I love Ellen! * * * * * * * * * * * *
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The book catches you from the start. After having a few puppies of my own I can see some of thinking that may be transpiring in their heads through eyes of this author. Great book and fast read. Highly recommended for anyone with dogs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it...great love story<br />It made me follow all the way to the end of the book. I just hope it ends grwat
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love this TV series watched all of them except first one. Can't wait to watch it. Received as promised and at a great price which was lowered from original purchase price without me having to request. Excellent quality.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a really good game. graphics and storyline were great. everything about it is perfect. they have a hint button in case you get lost anywhere during the game as well.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Watched almost all of them on TV but really excited to get Season One. Excellent quality, packaged well and received on time. I ordered prior to release and got it as promised and a great price. No complaints.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|So far, I've only downloaded the freebie which only allows access to the first level ... workin' in the Bronx!<br /><br />Thinking about leveling up!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story is amazing to say the least. The characters are so dynamic and unique. The world is unlike anything I have ever read.  After reading I, Zombie I wanted something else by this author and my husband recommended the first wool story. I was instantly addicted. I can't wait to read first shift and second shift!
B00001OH1S|5.0|Love this soundtrack. I adore this movie, it's fun and I like listening to the music when I have dinner parties.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good game like the graphics,I really like hidden objects games and this is one of the best I have tried
0385336950|5.0|Arrived quickly and it great condition - just as described.  I however did not read the explanation well enough and bought the wrong book!  Ooops.  Wanted the other Cloud Atlas... my daughter however is reading it and says it's very good!  lol
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good game like the graphics,I really like hidden objects games and this is one of the best I have tried
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Sequels can be very disappointing but this one was a pleasure to watch. Some of the same jokes from the previous movies. Fun new characters and still the lovable old ones. It's a journey worth watching with your kids.
1451673442|5.0|This is a great book, although sometimes life gets so busy that you have to start the process over.<br />It helps me to be grateful for the things that I take for granted.<br />I recommend this book.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Use on my Kindle Fire and although, of course, it not the same as on pc or laptop, it does the job and am<br />very pleased to have it. Takes a little time to figure out but doable.
1582701709|5.0|I have read this book many times. I love it!<br />I bought a copy for my daughter, she loves it.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Glad to finally have it on DVD and Blu-ray.  Shipment came prompt, Did not find digital copy code that others had mentioned but not really interested in that anyway.  Just thought I would mention it in case someone was buying it strictly for that.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|For as much as I love to hate Kanye for being a sample stealing egomaniac, I find it impossible to hate the album.  It is one of the few hip hop albums I consider an art piece.  I have listened to full album a couple dozen times and love it as a background piece to work (I work from home).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|DVD came quickly and undamaged.  Firefly is a great series with campy comedy and a dose of adventure and drama.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is great movie if you like A Capella music.  The men and women's groups competing are very realistic of real competition.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Well the film itself I love. The dialogue and music are witty and enjoyable. Quality of the product was perfect & had a quick delivery.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This app is one of the BEST apps I EVER had. The gameplay is amazing, and the graphics are, too. Only thing is, it needs a trade currency system. Trade food for coins, coins for gems,  and gems for coins. Only reason why I'm giving it four stars.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Space, and the tricks of gravity, add another dimension to Angry Bird Play.  It is an enjoyable game to play.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It was a Christmas gift, it was a wonderful surprise, just what she wanted, couldn't wait until she could watch it.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|While the acting, setting, and overall storyline were as campy as I had been lead to expect, we came away from the movie with the distinct feeling that it was nothing more than one inside joke against another against another... but never having seen the original TV series, we had no context in which to frame them.  It was a funny movie in its own right, but too much was lost due to a lacking cultural education on my part :).
1844137872|5.0|Bought this after reading a friend's copy.  It's so interesting.  Banksy is still witty and intelligent, even if most of the world is over-exposing him now.  Worth an enlightening read.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Too short for me. I want my money back. I finished this dumb book in twenty minutes. I thought it would be like the other books, but I was WRONG. Get it from it from your local library instead of buying it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I can't believe how crisp, tight, and epic &#34;Celebration Day&#34; is. After all these years, Led Zeppelin still knows how to rock like the rock-gods that they are. There are classics in this movie as well as some of their less-heard-on-the-radio tunes; and even one tune that is a first time for them to play live. As a die-hard Led Zeppelin fan for the las 35 years, this movie does not disappoint and is a must-see for any Zeppelin fan!!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|ANGRY BIRDS IS A SENSLESS GAME --- I DO NOT WASTE MY TIME WITH IT.  I AM AMAZED THAT SO MANY LIKE IT.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|if you watch both movies you will see a parallel between the two movies.<br />yes there are some difference between the two but both have their moments.<br /><br />if you like john wayne this is a great movie to watch.<br />this is one of my top 5 best john wayne movies.<br />no particular order.<br /><br />McLintock<br />The Shootist<br />The Sons Of Katie Elder<br />She Wore a Yellow Ribbon<br />El Dorado/Rio Bravo (count these as one because they are so closely a like.<br /><br />Hondo<br />The Alamo<br />The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance
B008NW67E0|5.0|...do not disappoint.  Whether you have or haven't heard their albums before, get this one.  You'll be glad you did.
B003VW54QO|5.0|Rio Bravo is a classic john wayne movie.<br />john wayne is a sheriff and dean martin is is deputy.<br />lots of good old fashion western movie.<br />this and el dorado are almost the same movie.<br /><br />if you watch both movies you will see a parallel between the two movies.<br />yes there are some difference between the two but both have their moments.<br /><br />if you like john wayne this is a great movie to watch.<br />this is one of my top 5 best john wayne movies.<br />no particular order.<br /><br />McLintock<br />The Shootist<br />The Sons Of Katie Elder<br />She Wore a Yellow Ribbon<br />El Dorado/Rio Bravo (count these as one because they are so closely a like.<br /><br />Hondo<br />The Alamo<br />The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance
B004LP601S|5.0|...the way you hope they will sound.  Not to take away from their previous endeavors but this album rocks.  It's really fun and there are plenty of tracks that you can't help but sing along with.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch perfect was a great movie. Very funny. I loved all the music. The best part of the movie to me was.....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A good game, innovative gameplay, not too fast. Play at a leisurely pace. Puzzles are not to hard to accomplish.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fun and challenging for both myself and my 3yr old - the physics in this game are amazing.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Watching this on a 50&#34; LED HDTV with surround sound is absolutely stunning. You feel as though you're actually in the locations they filmed.
B009MO5960|1.0|I am a huge fan of the 4 previous resident evil movies, so I figured it was safe to buy this rather than rent it. Boy was I wrong!<br />40 minutes in there is no story line and you will have no idea whats going on. It will get worse from there.<br /><br />--Bummed
B009NPKTN6|3.0|The movie was okay. A little cheesy. Pay attention to the PG-13 rating, it's not appropriate for kids under 13.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Bought this for my son last year for Christmas and he loves it.  His friend has the same pack and loves his too.  Very durable, you will not be dissapointed.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Some clever and humorous lines make it an enjoyable movie for adults, not just kids.  Would watch again another year.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Somewhat of a major conversion to move over from my old Kindle, Sotitaire has helped my adjustment also is a great stress reliever. Have yet to venture to any of the other games.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I had fun until I went and visited neighbor. Then I couldn't get back to my store. I will try reinstalling it but only once.
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|the child I bought this for absolutely loves it. he plays with it everyday. I would recommend this item to anyone
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Better than the last one! Very entertaining. Good adventure and story line. JLo does great with her character. I love Sid!
B007OAAK0O|5.0|This performance shows why Diana Ross is a show business legend. The African dance number puts her in a class all by herself and I love to watch it over and over again.<br /><br />Too bad we can't stay forever young!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the new Batman movies and won't let my almost seven year old son watch them just yet so I began looking for the movies I grew up with.  I had a hard time finding them, but he loves them!
B005GTJEZC|5.0|I bought this at first sight and I have never seen it in a store since, and I do not regret it. This is the ultimate package! The movies are brilliant and should be seen by everyone. The quality of the video and sound is as always great and those that want to show off what their systems are capable of should buy this. The only gripes I have with it is that some of the extras haven't been upgraded and that the final two movies aren't in 3D, not that I care that much.

B005UT29Z0|1.0|Horribly stupid interpretation of what happened! Boring, poorly acted and droll story! Save your money...more importantly, SAVE YOUR TIME!!! Pathetic!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second time around was not as good, but still amazing. I loved this book a lot. Certainly a good read.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I got the imic because I needed a cheap way to DJ in software like Ableton (and cheaper alternatives like DJay) without buying a much more expensive interface than those sold by companies like Teac. When DJing one needs two audio outputs, one that is going to the speakers for everyone to dance to and another for the DJ to cue up and beat-match the next track. Of course the problem with a laptop is that it usually only has one audio output. The imic adds a second audio output, allowing me to DJ with very little equipment, just laptop, imic, and headphones, which is very convenient. The audio quality of the imic has always been as good as the two laptops I've used it with and the device has withstood a fair amount of use over the 5 years (yes you are reading that correctly) that I've been using it.<br /><br />The imic is pretty easy to set up for djing, those it does require a little bit of work. Most audio software I've used will only accept one sound card at a time, that means that you have to find a way to make both outputs (the imic and laptop outputs) run on the same driver. I'm currently running Windows 7 and have found that ASIO4All, a freeware audio driver you can download online, will do just that. Once you have the driver setup it's plug and play every time! I've used this device on Macs as well and there is a similar solution there.<br /><br />Apparently the device can also be used for audio input using mics, instruments, turntables, etc. I can't speak to the use of the device for those purposes since I do have a more advanced interface that handles that sort of thing so haven't tried using the imic for that purpose (plus all my instrument cables are quarter inch so I would need an adapter to run them into the eighth inch port on the imic. That being said I prefer to use the imic for live purposes like djing because of the very low latency compared to more advanced equipment.<br /><br />Overall a very good product for the right price.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent movie and excellent picture quality. The batman movies seem to get continually better. Quite unusual theses days. Christian Bale delivers a another great performance.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Couldn't put it down till finished. Others complained about getting stuck in the beginning, but the key is in the book on the desk!
B004AQR29C|2.0|Only download this movie if you run out of Law & Order reruns, which is probably not going to happen. This movie is truly &#34;Expendable&#34;.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie. It was a great combination of comedy and musical without being a traditional musical.
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|Not interested in watching ignorance and stupidity in a movie - there's enough of that in news stories coming from Washington, D.C.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I choose a 5 star rating because the series did not end and with unanswered questions about what happened to the characters of the story.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|The story is an interesting take on a few themes, namely &#34;old age versus youth,&#34; &#34;humility versus arrogance,&#34; &#34;sacrificing self for work.&#34; It's worth watching, but don't expect greatness.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never been a big reader, so when I got my kindle I knew I had to start somewhere. This was the perfect book to start with. Life is not always what it seams but you can always turn to books. This will now be one of my go to reads. (Over and over again)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read!  I didn't want to stop reading!!!!<br />Colleen is a very good author and I have and will continue to recommend her books!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Came quickly and actually got $2 back after purchasing because price went down. Over all a great experience. Must buy for any movie fan
B009A9BF5G|5.0|After my second live Coldplay concert in excellent box seats at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2012 this purchase was a must.<br />It is great to blast this out of the surround sound system in the living room on the 60&#34; LCD and just relive the concert experience.<br />The quality of the recording is great and I would recommend this to any Coldplay fan.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I dislike that the game is not actually free. As mentioned by others....once you are out of diamonds you are screwed. Game play is fun,  though.
0785163174|5.0|I was affraid of this book, but it was such a great surprise to see how fun this fight came out. There's so many good characters lines and it's really cool to see how Bendis ends with his house of M.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great movie, good package and pricing for 3 versions discs' for this movie. The kids and the girl's love to watch this movie. It's entertaining.
B008IYOEZM|5.0|**TOTALLY SPOILER FREE**<br /><br />First I want to say that I was lucky to get this on Instant Video so I didn't have the DVD problem others had where Showtime gave away the ending in the show previews.  But I was thankful to be warned about that ahead of time in case it had happened.  So if you get the DVD, shut off the show previews so you don't have the end spoiled for you because this season is incredible.<br /><br />I've watched all of the seasons of Dexter up to Season 6 which I just finished.  I don't have Showtime so I always rent the DVDs but couldn't find this one anywhere so ended up buying it and I'm so glad I did because it is one I will want to watch again.  Intense, Exciting, Surprising, Exceptional.<br /><br />Also, I have to say that I love little Harrison.  He is absolutely adorable and sweet and he's brought out a totally different side to Dexter that Dexter didn't expect and I love that.  If you like the show and haven't seen Season 6, definitely check it out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|GREAT book.... not what you think. Wish there was a sequel to it. I will read another book by the author.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|This games has been played in our family since 87. Also a great birthday gift to family who grew up playing Mario Games.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written!  Also, a beautiful story.  Very interesting information on the definition of each plant and flower.  I never knew the meaning behind each one!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Too many movies today go long on action and short on storyline and characterization.  This 2012 remake of the original \\"Total Recall\\" is a good example of this.  There is so much action in this flick that the viewer rarely has time to catch his or her breath and reflect on what the story is trying to tell us, i.e. what is reality and who, really, is our protagonist.  The original version is not exactly short on action but it does give the viewer a chance to reflect on what is going on.<br /><br />The film also takes idiotic liberties with the original Phillip K. Dick (\\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\") short story upon which this film is (supposedly) based.  In the original story and original film the protagonist had a yearning to go to Mars.  Here, there is no Mars; just some ambiguous political setup between something called \\"The United Federation of Britain\\" and \\"the Colony.\\"  My son's reaction summed it up pretty well: \\"who cares?\\"  I get it that the makers of this film felt a need to differentiate it from the original version.  In my opinion this change to the storyline was a distinct failure.<br /><br />The characterizations in this film left plenty to be desired as well.  The actresses are all skinny, dirty, good-looking (did I say skinny?) women who look so much the same that I had trouble telling them apart. Evidently in the future they will not be taking showers or even washing their hands.  There is no chemistry between anyone.  By the last 30 minutes I was more than ready for this film to end, which it (mercifully) finally did.<br /><br />This is a remake that should never have been made.  My son and I watched this New Year's Day and we both agreed that our time would have been better spent watching the original version.  RJB.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you have ever owned a dog or like dogs, you will enjoy this book. It was a quick read and had me laughing and crying. The racing metaphors can get a little old while reading, but don't let them keep you from reading this book. To be honest, I skimmed some of those chapters.
1594744769|4.0|This is a good read, especially if you are a teen. I found the story quite good but I would have liked a little more depth to it. I like the interplay between the pictures and the stories.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I watched the album as a live show on Direct TV and I loved it ! !  I bought the album from AMAZON and  loved the songs over the last 50 Years GRRR!  philboatbike
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I must be alone in this, based on all the reviews! I found this book to be ok,but I found it was very slow in parts and took a while to build. The first few chapeters were fantastic and got me very interested, but then it slowed right down. I like the world the author created and although the book picked up the pace in the second half, I found the middle of the book tough going. Overall I thought this book was good, but not as good as what everyone else says unfortunately!!
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|It's has alot of funny part but there are some slow chessy ones too<br />you must like this type of movie too really get into it<br />it is funny after smking just saying lol<br />well watch a few times
B004L9MFM2|4.0|I saw the series first, then read the book. The book gives you more depth in the stories and complements th TV show well. I think it is probably better to read the books first though, to get that element of surprise.

B0069HCYWA|3.0|Richard is a very inspiring man!! This book gives you some great stories about his life and makes you admire him even more. I couldnt finish it though as I got over it.

B003L77G06|3.0|I received the second season of Modern Family very quickly.  The only downside is when my girlfriend opened up the inside of the case (it was a birthday gift), the casing that held the DVD's together was broken.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|no problems with the dvds. absolutely amazing price. got this as a christmas gift but i ordered it myself. great purchase.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Im satisfied with this product. It doenst take up much space on my shelf for this trilogy. Nice book and casing design. However the first time i got it, i got 2 copies of the Dark Knight Rises and no Special Features. Got it replaced and now its all good.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Only the power of advertising has helped sell this drivel. I have  been unable to find any person with university entrance I.Q. who has finished the book.Absolute lack of knowledge of human sexual responce.Suggest the author read Masters and Johnston..
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Clint Eastwood's movies are about telling a story.  &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; paints characters from a time and place in America, like many of his movies do.  Tell me another story Mr. Eastwood.
B0053O89IS|3.0|Let me start by saying, I love Bones.  For a time I was obsessed.  This season was short for obvious reasons (Emily Deschanel was about to have a baby.  The show as still great, but this dvd hardly has any extras or behind the scenes things.  The fact that it was only 13 episodes long and lacked much of any extras made it a disappointing purchase for me.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|If teddy bears dropping f bombs and other profanity is funny go for it. Could have been a cute movie with out all that. Would not waste my time on this one.
B008M721MS|5.0|the best way to see and chat with family and friends who a far away from u sharing pictures, music, etc.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I used to have my little ponies when they first came out. playing this makes me feel like a kid again. its mildly addictive and I recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love reading the bible and hear it read to me. the words are awesome just as the audio is wonderful.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the 1st book and this one was just as good. It kept you on edge the entire time you are reading and the ending was quite a surprise
B00AKS656U|5.0|i like this game. it's very fun. i have on problem however. The game is too short! i beat the game in less than a day! but still it's fun
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|just fun.  gratuitous swearing, farting, pot-smoking, and overall parody on growing up in the 80's.  silly, but works for a saturday morning grown-up cartoon.  the plot/antics/dialog is juvenile however the acting is good.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|a good game. i have beaten it. i had a lot of fun. but i have 2 problems.<br /><br />1: the ending; the ending was terrible. you don't even hurt the boss. all you do in the last level is save your friend. then the villain leaves. i wish the villain had became good. he seemed nice untill he got that pencil<br />2: the legnth; there are only 13 levels. and you only have to beat 7 before you get to the final level.<br />but the game is fun.
0811879542|4.0|We saw this book at the library and then bought if for a 4 year old friend's birthday.  I'm not sure how long the novelty of it will last, but it's at least fun the first several times!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|If you are a big Beatles fan, consider this.  The product description pretty much speaks for itself, and the item does not disappoint.  It is surprisingly heavy.  As others have said, be careful with the stem, but I haven't had any problems with it.  Just nice to have everything in one cool little package, stowed away with no worries of ever having to lose your collection due to failed hard drives, lost/damaged CD's, etc.
B005VPRETE|4.0|My girls have enjoyed putting together the tree house and playing with the different pieces.  I think it is a good value.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The dialogues, the characters and insights are believable. It's not sappy, although it has moments of sadness. John Green's word choices and phrases are sophisticated for the age group of his audience. I will read through his other works. I wish he would round out the characters of the parents. They seem like by-products or they are just there to make the mortgage payments.
0385302320|5.0|My book, Voyager, came in due time, in excellent condition, and the seller even left a notation saying &#34;enjoy&#34;, which was a pleasant note to receive as I opened the book. Thank you. Now I can scratch 3 items off my bucket list!<br /> oyager by Diana Gabaldon
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A good read<br />Chris Kyle tells the story with no b.s.! I'm glad to have read it and would recommend reading it to anyone.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie was not as good as I thought it would be.  Batman used to be interesting. All in all it was just okay!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i lived, loved this book! once i started reading i could not put it down, i have now stayed up all night reading every last word of this story. i want more! the characters in hopeless kept me mesmorized and wanting for more. thank you collen for writing something so beautiful, i havn't been so ingrossed in a book for long time and i read often. i didn't even want to stop reading this story to eat! thank you once again for bringing sky and holder into my world, i can't stop smiling.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I rented this one for my grandchildren and they loved it, your children will probably love it also. I recommend this one!~!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel- very easy to read in one sitting, if you like football then it's a bonus. Looking forward to seeing the movie even more now. Kudos to Matthew Quick!
B009329Y30|5.0|This is a very emotional movie. If you love to cry and laugh at the same time you will love this one~!!~
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Bought this a while back just not in 3-D, purchased a new one for the 3-D disc.  It is a prequel to the Alien series.  Not as fast paced as the latest Alien movies, but back to the original with better special effects and intense story line.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Did not like this movie at all...It was really stupid all the way through. Would not recommend it unless you like vulgar language!!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves all the Tinker Bell movies but enjoyed the story of this one the most so far, mainly because of the new sister story line.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I enjoyed  William's story explaining how he learned about electricity generated by a windmill and how he obtained parts and built the windmill.  He is a brilliant young man with great talent in science and engineering, and he learned a lot by himself by reading and rereading a couple physics texts from a school library.<br /><br />The book is well written and helps the reader understand the challenges of being poor in a third world country.
B005USZML4|3.0|It was not as expected.  I was unaware that this was a book more intended for juvenile reader.  I bought it because it was written by John Grisham, one of my favorites authors.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a good movie.  I was a little hesitent to watch it because I thought it would be a chick flick and somewhat of a musical.  It was actually really funny!
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|This book was amazing! Becky Bloomwood is a character that is so easy to relate to. This story was just a great read!
B009NXV2RK|4.0|As with most of Clancy's books the interlocking developments around the world are current and  believable as are the strategies adopted to defuse the threats. It is once again the case of Clancy understanding the intricacies of the worlds  political and defence relationships  that makes his stories so relevant. Whether it be the cybercrime or the quest of naval supremacy both issues are today in the international arena and as with many of Clancy's novels  you are left in little doubt  Clancy is actually predicting the future and providing , in particular , a guide book for USA defence strategy and international diplomacy.<br />I suspect that the character of Jack Ryan Jr will be the subject of a number of Clancy ( and his collaborations)books in the future
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Love Clint Eastwood movies. Love Baseball movies. So Eastwood and Baseball what's not to like. Loved all the characters too.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Totally worth the download price. Seems wrong to have paid so little for such great music. Not one bad song
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|good wholesome entertainment. with a purpose<br />very entertaining I would watch again great for kids and adults.  fun visual heartwarming
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|You should buy this Game now. Funny and creative. Can't put it down. Would pay for this game. Addictive game! Just don't die. ;-)
B009V3KKXY|5.0|We are huge fans of JD and are avid You Tube followeres. My husband is in the US Navy so when they can not get internet he flips on his kindle and follows the excellent pictures.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|One is never disappointed with Rod Stewart's music.  He is among the greatest of musical performers.  Such is true with his newest Christmas CD.
B0076DELIG|5.0|never read a book that Michael Connelly has  written that I have not enjoyed, tbhis one is no exception.Thank you
B008I3QZKU|5.0|If you listen to 'Miss Atomic Bomb' and are not on your feet moving around, or you listen to 'Still' and are not moved you might want to consider the problem being elsewhere than with this album.  I could go on about the other exceptional songs on this CD, about 1/2 of them if you get the 'Extended'.  They had 5 of the most accomplished producers in modern music working on this with them...
B00846REIS|2.0|more cheap entertainment if you can get it for free - read it, if not don't waste your money  it was almost copy cat shades of grey
1400067820|4.0|Antifragile is not as readable as the Black Swan, but the book contains important insights worth far more than the cover price. The writer's pomposity and monstrous ego are off-putting for most readers, but if you can get through them, you'll find ideas that will improve your life.<br /><br />- How to successfully operate in a world you don't understand<br />- How not to be a sucker for fake experts (stockbrokers, economists, doctors, etc)<br />- Doing is intellectually superior to theoretisizing, and doers (artisans, engineers, entrepreneurs) are the ones who move the world forward, academics spend other people's money to write papers to other academics and take the credit.<br /><br />Hoperfully, after reading the book, Engineers and doers will find enough balls not to pushed around by people like me (academic economist and a journalist)! :)<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|poorly written, definitely not something I would recommend, it was just a cheaper version of the &#34;shades of grey&#34; I will read the next one that comes out in the spring.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is the coolest hidden object game I have ever played. I just hate that you only get so far then you are prompted to buy the so- called \\"free\\" game to finish the quest.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Nice movie.  Kind of like High School Musical.. But if you love musical (glee, hair spray, grease etc..) this is the movie for you.
B0039PPW60|5.0|I'm still learning all the features on my x1204USB mixer, but so far it works well for my needs. I got the USB working and it is noise free, but I have a delay in the sound that I don't understand. I'm still trying to figure that one out. A big peeve of mine is the way 8th Street Music shipped it to me. It was just in the original factory box which is not intended to be a shipping box. That box should have been put in a brown shipping box with adequate packing. It was not. Luckily there was no damage to the unit. The factory box has scrapes from shipping rash and has labels plastered on it. I doubt if the factory would take the unit back in that box. I read another review on it where the mixer was supposed to be a Christmas gift and the lady's son accepted the delivery and found out what he was getting for Christmas since the mixer was just in its factory box. Sheesh!
B00632HWOG|1.0|here is a small list of what I cant stand about the newest version of Yahoo mail. I used to be able to get graphics in my mail. (pintrest people will know what I mean), don't get that anymore,  hate auto correct,  cant stand the way they set up sending e-mail messages,  the flashing ads are just about giving me seizures...there isn't much I do like about the new version. I don't like this version on my fire or my Pc.<br />Yahoo, do us all a favor let us opt out of upgrades.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Very good movie that takes place in India. Several plot lines carry on at once, but are continuously intertwined throughout the film. It was nice to watch a movie that wasn't focused solely on young actors and actresses.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Of course I'm a huge Springsteen fan but after receiving this (from my very thoughtful brother) I actually shed a few tears. This is the most intimate and revealing document of such an accomplished musician and artist, unlike anything I've ever seen before.  I never thought I would be able to peer into the creative process on such a \\"pen and paper\\" level. It's stunning.. I cried, that say it all.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Like others better on PC but seems to work fine so far.  This is the first card game DL'd on the Kindle Fire HD. I might learn to like it in time.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|Johnny Depp and chocolate-what's not to love! Very enjoyable, sweet movie. Very happy to find it on Blu-ray to add to my Johnny Depp movie collection.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This movie was a different twist on your typical romantic movies. Set in Yemen with Sheik and everything it was entertaining and for once didn't make the whole Arab world look like the bad guys. I highly recommend it.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|Awesome DVD/CD! Aerosmith gets better with age and adding Johnny Depp to the mix certainly was an added bonus too!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've never used a Facebook app that worked properly, until now! works wonderfully on my kindle fire hd. I'm glad I downloaded it.
B007R41E8O|1.0|does not work on kindle! might be a great game on other platforms. whose to say? not I, as I can't t play it on my device.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I love this app for WordPress. it's so much more user-friendly than the desktop site. it's great for publishing on-the- go!!
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Love the actors in this move and the special features.  Might be a little corny at times, but that adds to the overall awesomeness.  I'd definitely recommend.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Reminiscent of a movie seen although I prefer to place Hugh Jackson and Jennifer Aniston in lead roles. A good romance. As in life love comes in unexpected ways and circumstance.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The Walking Dead is a series that grabs you after just one episode.  The second season draws you in to the lives of the characters and you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  Killing the zombies is only secondary to what is going on between the humans in this show.  Don't let the Dead scare you away.  Watch this show!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game the only problem is that it is too addictive I can't stop playing. Your family will love it
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Even if you aren't a fan of the Zombie genre, this series has enough human interaction to grip you and keep you coming back for more.  You'll become addicted after just one episode.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I found myself really liking this movie and wanting to not take my wife for granted. Would recommend this to anyone especially couples!
B004OSPTSM|5.0|delighted my 80 year old mother who'd wanted a nice copy of her favourite book...she is really pleased with it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great read I can't wait to continue reading this series. It shows the pressures that teenagers face, especially with Hanna.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Truth is I only read this book because I had to for school. At first I thought I was going to hated it even though my teacher said all his students loved it. But it turns out it is a great book and I love it. I like the fact that it's written as a journal so we can actually experience the changes and experiences that Charlie goes through. I suggest reading this for fun maybe during a vacation or just whenever you have free time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana is reminiscent of old school point and click adventure interactive graphical games.  Entirely in first person view, the protagonist treks through the carnival searching for clues behind the disappearance of a young woman.  The plot was compelling enough to hold my interest. The puzzles were not too challenging but enough variety to make it fun.<br /><br />It's free to download but it's a trial version.  A tad bit short on the storyline.  I wish there were more interaction between the carnival and its alternate universe. But I suspect noone likes to backtrack back and forth. (Im a fan of Maniac Mansion).<br /><br />Overall, it's a fun game, graphics are detailed oriented, entertaining storyline.  If you like this kind of genre, it fits the bill though you'd want more after you beat it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very enjoyable.  I couldn't stop reading.  I will now read the rest of the series.  Much better than the movie.
B000007U6V|5.0|This compact disc was in very good condition with no scratches, and it had the classic original LP cover art.
B000000WHC|5.0|During a recent Blues festival held in London, England, blues legend B.B. King referred to Gary Moore<br />as his favorite guitarist.  The complement is well-deserved.  Considering Gary Moore's talent, he is<br />easily one of the most under-recognized axemen of our time.  His cover of Albert King's &#34;Pretty Woman'<br />and others, is truely phenominal.  If you like music by B.B. King, Albert King and Albert Collins, then this is<br />an album for your collection.
B00427X9WI|5.0|Loved tha book and definitely loved the movie. Its always nice when they stay very close to the book and dont change the story. Very inspirational story. I would recommend it to everyone who are on a spiritual journey.
0756666937|4.0|I purchased this for my nephew for Xmas and it was hard to get him to leave the book alone and actually go outside and play.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very good mind game - keeps you entertained & engaged.<br />For a puzzle game it is very easy to pick up & go play - when you are bored or just want a diversion. Very cool game
B005H29GSI|4.0|This is better when used with other games or multiple purchases as it has small amount of playing pieces and can get pretty boring after a while of use.  We combined this with the Knock on Wood version and makes for more challenges.  But makes a 4 year old very happy.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm 70% through the book and I gave up reading it.  Boring book.  Grisham has sold out and is just filling pages with words to get paid.  He is living off past creative writing and story telling.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This is better when used with other games or multiple purchases as it has small amount of playing pieces and can get pretty boring after a while of use.  We combined this with the Ice version and makes for more challenges.  But makes a 4 year old very happy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just finished Gone Girl and I absolutely loved it! My only complaint would be the ending. It definitely could've been better, but other than that the book was fantastic. Creative! Surprising! Refreshing!
B00466HM28|4.0|Very good keyboard....somewhat difficult to use.  Arrived fast!  Appears good quality although just not that easy to set up and use.
0736092269|5.0|perfect book for National Certification Career Association ,Certified Rehabilitation Therapy Technician Exam, just loved the way it explains everything, by this book if u r appearing for the ncca National Certification Career Association ,Certified Rehabilitation Therapy Technician Exam.
B000TLMWMY|3.0|Loved the memories of Johnny Cash and his guests  A very eclectic grouping of country, rock and folk guests on his show  Loved it.  Would have given a rating of 5 stars, but the condition of disk 2 was inferior It stalled two times in its play.  Not happy with that.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very fun and easy to play! Easy to get neighbors to help with quests. The dragons are adorable! I would definitely recommend.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really loved how this book started strange and rocketed to creepy then just when it started to make sense blasted off to the next level. I would love to see a movie made about this book just so I could experience it a whole new way.<br /><br />If you like suspense, mystery, and the bizarre all mixed together with great writing and great characters, read this now.
B0091REZMW|5.0|If you like hidden object games with mystery, you'll love playing this game. The quests are clear and simple. There is always something new going on in the game as well. I enjoy playing tremendously.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I used to play this game all of the time on my kindle fire, but now it won't even open.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I love all the accessories that came with the doll house, $40 is a bit pricey though. Overall its just a great barbie house, bought for my 4 year old and she plays with it a lot. She is really into cooking and the oven/ serving station is great!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Have read many books regarding &#34;experiencing Heaven&#34;, could definitely tell this was written by a highly trained physician, who was very technical in trying to explain his experience.  A little hard to follow at times.  Had to re-read certain parts to fully understand his description,  but all in all very good and definitely believed what he experienced.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have barley even used this mouse and i can tell its amazing, its very accurate and smooth. It reads on multiple surfaces with out any errors. I love this mouse so much i would definatley recommend to any beginner  gamer who wants a great mouse at a subtle price. Thank you so much anker!
B0027BVMSY|3.0|Our 13 year old grandson had never seen a James Bond movie, so he and I rented this one.  Not the best Bond movie, but entertaining.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the story and the characters. It is well written and the inter-play between the upstairs and the downstairs is both credible and fascinating.
B001DUJNGS|3.0|Although some people will of course disagree with me I found this CD lacking.  The previous Enigma CDs were much more interesting and seemed to flow more.  In this CD I found only two songs that I liked.  The rest just didn't appeal to me.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Thought it was a good story and looking forward to the movie. Didn't have the same emotional pull that usually is there with a Sparks book.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|what can you say great movie and verry happy it realy made my harry potter colection compleat if you like harry potter this is a must
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a nice change to angry birds. I love being able to bring my game anywhere and not tied to the computer.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|what can you say great movie and verry happy it realy made my harry potter colection compleat if you like harry potter this is a must
B00003CXC7|5.0|Only Hitch could get such a range of mood, light, color, vitality and morbidity out of an enclosed courtyard without a single shot of the sky....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun and lots of levels to play! Challenging with all the pigs to shoot at with big shooter!!
B0000549B0|5.0|So sweet...the story, the acting, the best of Jimmy Stewart here. It's the writing of a lost innocence. So refreshing to see now and then. It restores some faith in (wo)mankind...
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Was Dead on Arrival..Would not charge, turn on or anything...the only thing it would do the indicator lite flickered<br />erratically red...and was dim....not very bright...(the indicator lite that is on the power button...)<br />Tried several computers....5 different usb cables everything to make sure it was maybe something else.....<br />I guess i just got unlucky......<br /><br />Note: This review is for the Fiio e17 only...and because it was Doa on delivery.....Other units out there would probably<br />be fine....thats why ill stay neutral with this review...theres always gone be some issues nothing is perfect....<br />Also Amazon is amazing took care of my problem right away.......The customer service is really good......<br />Thanks Amazon.......
B005HSL626|5.0|something about slicing fruits and avoiding bombs makes me want to play forever. what makes it more fun is how you can upgrade your blade, read interesting facts after each game, and it's free!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished reading the series and now I wish there would be another book to this series, yet again I find myself looking for another series
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a world of blocks where you survive and try to build anything you can imagine. just watch out for monsters... and HEROBRINE
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read!!! It is 6 in the morning and I'm still up because I couldn't stop reading! I am in love with the characters, the plot, and everything else! It was so unexpected, I couldn't stop reading though common sense told me the book would be there later. A definite must read. Passionate scenes that make you squirm, and an actual story? Oh yeah, the best.
B0088O11NU|1.0|this app crashes every 30 seconds, gets boring instantly, and is laggy. all these make it difficult to play the puzzle. I wouldn't recommend this app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I gave this book five stars because the author  put in many details and showed me how hard it would be to have a face like August. Kids like him struggle more in life than u could ever imagine! I really liked the part about how August thought he would never make friends at his new school, but Summer stepped up, knowing that she would be risking the popularity level she would be in. I would reccomend  this book to anybody who wants to know how hard life is for many people, and that they can't always be perfect or have the highest amount of popularity. Popularity is not a competition on who's the best.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's an exciting book and held my interest throughout.  I love the CIA books and put him in a category with DeMille, Baldacci and Brad Thor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book; suspenseful, daring, dirty, and every girls fantasy. Highly recommended to any woman or man over  the age of 18
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Again, I recommend this book to all ages because it is so well written that anyone can understand it. This book explains the meaning of war and the real story that can come to a country, children, families, and everyone. I enjoy this book even though it's depressing, but very true of what can happen to one person. I have nothing poor to say about this book. It's truly amazing....that even though our lives can be hard and that one can go through so much that we can find that light, that meaning of life to go. This book and series is a must read!
0143034901|1.0|I don't understand the near-5 star ranking here. I thought it was awful. Read the other 1-star reviews and consider yourself warned!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr Alexander gives a medical view of death and the after life. God allowed him a glimpse of heaven so he can share with the living there is life after death of the body. The read was a comfort for me since my mom passed a few months ago. It is written to convince doctors, etc. that God is real and is geared toward those that &#34;think&#34; only in Scientific mentality. I recommend it to anyone whom a family member or friend has passed.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|If you are a Pendergast fan than all that needs be said is - read this book! If you have yet to acquaint yourself with this surprising and mysterious character, than start with another book - perhaps STILL LIFE WITH CROWS first. You won't be sorry. Just scared.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|A game this popular should support more hardware. Every other version of Angry Birds works on the Tabeo and there'e not much new here over Angry Birds Space.
B002TVQ4H6|5.0|.<br />A \\"Must Watch\\" if you appreciate this genre.<br /><br />DON'T READ TOO MANY REVIEWS! (don't spoil it)<br /><br />Go in cold and Just watch the movie unfold.  Watch it, and enjoy it.<br /><br />Eventually watch the \\"making of\\" and extra materials and understand its complexity and background.<br /><br />After watching thousands of movies I can say this is in my top 100.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: The \\"lenticular\\" packaging is just one of those fancy, paper slip on covers, you can tilt at an angle and get the image to shift.<br /><br />Yes DVD is in a plastic clamshell case, but cover has the special lenticular decal, hence it might be desirable or collectable.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This product does exactly what I wanted it to. It takes and saves notes to access at a later date.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I read this book and learned about the Times and a great deal about the people that Lincoln surrounded himself with. The Book gives a great amount of detail about the relationships of Lincoln and those close to him.
B000002QWD|5.0|For some reason that I can't understand MCA stopped making this CD. I gave my copy to my sister thinking I could get another one because it was always available. When I went to order it there are sellers who are selling it, but it is no longer being made.  It is like not having a Christmas tree for the holidays. Every song on here is a great Yuletide treat. I hope MCA will come to their senses and start producing it again! It is one wonderful Christmas Album. By the way The Andrew Sisters make several appearances on here. If you have seen 'A Christmas Story' you will recognize &#34;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&#34; from the soundtrack.
1451648537|5.0|An amazing story of crazy ups and downs and an inspiration to every business owner (or owner wanna-be) to hang in there! From birth to college, Jobs seemed destined to become a complete drop-out.  But his design aesthetic paired with Steve Wozniak created Apple and made him $135m before they had to kick him out (for being a complete jerk to everyone). Then he lost almost everything he had, in the money-guzzling Pixar, before a gutsy 11th hour pivot turned that horrible lemon into billion dollar lemonade (and IPO).  Apple asked him to come back and he turned them from a dog into the world's most valuable company.  And we got the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, iCloud! Extremely well written...this books reveals Jobs with warts and all...loved it!
B0038W0OHQ|5.0|I will go as in-depth as I can with the review, hope you enjoy<br />also, I have used these headphones for a month, so I think I have more experience than more of the reviewers below<br /><br />so first off, you will notice when you get it, you will receive two cushions, which are interchangeable, in my opinion, the felt ear cups are far more comfortable than the leather, so I would go with that. Also, the headphones do need to be broken into, it will be very tight at first, so just stretch it out a little, I will be very comfy by 1-2 weeks of wearing. I would also say that these headphones need to be burned-in before you really start using it for everyday use. (here is a link so you can do that: [ [...] ]<br /><br />Ok, so let's dive into the features, the headphones are 50 mil. drivers, and have a retractable mic, which I do like. on top of the band is a memory foam cushion, so I have no problems with discomfort. The  earcups themselves are on a swivel, to fit more properly on heads. There is also the added feature of having removable earcups for travel, I personally have no use for this feature, but I think that it causes troubles for some as I hear many stories of one driver not emitting sound, I would say to just remove the cup and put it back in, or check if the connection is lose. The cord is braided, which is a nice touch, and connects to the headphones themselves through mini-usb. It also features and intelligently designed shortened cable for people who have a mic/audio hub in their keyboards, very smart. If not, you will have a connection that lengthens the cable. There is also a small control system to either mute/unmute the mic and a volume circle which rolls. This controls the headphone volume, not windows volume, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The sound quality. now this is the point where things will vary, I'm using a soundcard, and I would recommend, if you are not getting a soundcard, you might as well go with the USB version of this headset, thewhole point of the analog jacks are for people who have good sound.(In this review, I am using the Xonar DS, which is relatively cheap for a soundcard This can pump out great sound, I have messed with the EQ of my soundcard, and it works extremely well. The 7.1 (which I had to activate through the soundcard) works well and enhances the experience with music and games. You can have great directional accuracy with the 7.1 and sounds great with music (I listen to EDM, which relies on accuracy, so I think I can say very well all the parts of the music is very precise and clean) the quality is great and is better than my last headphones, the skullcandy aviators, which also sounded great.<br /><br />also, the mic is very clean and sounds good.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Comfy, although it will be needed to be broken into<br />-Amazing sound quality if you have the soundcard to drive it<br />-Great Directional Audio with 7.1 surround<br />-Driverless (pro or con)<br />-Immersive for both games and music (haven't watched any movies with this)<br /><br />Cons<br />-Open headset, so you will hear other things from your environment<br />-Sound quality depends on whether you can afford a soundcard or not<br /><br />Overall, this is a great headset it makes you immersed in games and the 50 mil drivers really give a music listening experience like no other, but a soundcard is needed, not integrated sound, to really give this the quality it deserves. I personally love this headset as I PC game a ton and listen to a ton of music too.<br /><br />***[EDIT]***<br />Ok, so now that I have my new Creative X-Fi Titanium HD soundcard, I can add some stuff. Even with this high-end of a soundcard, it STILL delivers even better sound quality (given that I have messed with the EQ once again). I have read reviews about how the headset's band can often slide back up, and I have to agree with this, this is a problem and can get somewhat annoying, but it doesn't take away from the sound quality of this product. Also, since this soundcard doesn't have a built in headphone amp, I will say that once you boost the trebles and bass, there isn't a need for a headphone amp of any sort, of course it will benefit the product, I just can't justify it as I would expect someone to buy a headphone amp with HIGH quality headphones, like sennheiser like HD 600 or along the lines of that, so if I were you, just find a soundcard that has a built in amp, but you will be perfectly fine even without one.<br />(also if you are listening to music with this, PLEASE buy mp3 files with a bit rate of 320 kbps or wav. format, as you will see a SIGNIFICANT sound quality difference in doing so)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book!!  I love books that make you laugh, cry, and have a surprise at the end!  I would definitely recommend this book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent thrillers, it keeps your expectations high waiting to see what will happen next. You do not want to get of the chair.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very entertaining. The acting was excellent, as could be expected from this cast. If you have the slightest interest, you'll love this film. Sorry, children...no vampires, no sex scenes, no violence, no super heroes.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|Beautiful language.  Intriguing story but a little long for the telling.  Glad I read it.  Dispelled the inaccuracies that were in my mind re the monster.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't sat and read a book in SO long. I decided to try the first book and couldn't put it down and so I bought the trilogy and it was the same with the other two books. This was a great series and hope to read more good books!  Love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until the next one comes out. I could barely put it down, and the ending is pretty intense! Come on May 2013!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I travel some and like to take my Kindle. The Zip Sleeve protects my Kindle and was well worth the price. It's not often you get value for theoney spent.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Good book to read along with &#34;Civil War Wives&#34; and viewing &#34;Lincoln&#34; and &#34;Django&#34;.  We have come a long way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|For such a silly game, this one really offers a challenge. You really have to think about ways to connect the dots.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I get the humor in this movie but my 2.5 and 5 yer old didn't. They watched it, but we're pretty scared most of the time. I think we'll stick with the first 2 in the series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome I haven't spent a penny and still a level fifteen with a dragon that will give me a gem a week and one other ultra rare dragon
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was so funny when Greg was born I would tell others about this book I liked it a lot,<br /><br />Lilly.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Such a wonderful love story. Only complaint what the sort of open ending... but I'm guilty of always wanting to know exactly what happened to the characters after all is said and done. Has highly recommend reading.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old grandson.  He was so excited about this encyclopedia!  He immediately started going through it and pointing out all the characters and telling me the stories about them.  He collects the Ninjago legos and watches the cartoons.  This was a definite asset to his collection.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|what a great animated movie with a lesson I loved it and I am 49 I can't wait to watch it with my grandaaugters
B0047BJIBU|5.0|Enough moving pieces to keep young children busy while still being very sturdy.  Looks and feels like a solid toy.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|dirty not what I expected although funny  not anything for any person under 21 in my opinion my boyfriend thought it was hilarious I was mostly shocked but its worth watching once
B008QTV3X0|4.0|This is a great show!  It looks like we will be watching the whole series.  I truly do recommend it
B009UX2YAC|1.0|i dont know i just dont know it is just that it is not really my thing im not much fond of it
B00AECDDYY|5.0|This game is addicting!  It requires you to change your strategy and tactics on each level.  The first time I played the game, I was a bit lost. By round three, I was on my way.  Losing a few times helps you adjust your approach.  I hope they come out with more levels!
B009GESJH2|4.0|I like that it is much less country than born free but wish it had more hip hop like Cocky does.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end of the rebellion may well kill Katniss Everdean and everybody she cares about, but does the end justify the means?  With creatures that will probably haunt my nightmares too, and cruelty of which only mankind is capable, Collins wraps up the Hunger Games trilogy.  Definitely worth the time spent reading.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|haveing trouble getting coverage, to use this, this is not your fault, but I am please that I could try this at no cost
030758836X|4.0|After just finishing [[ASIN:B00AL4LI24 The Doom Murders]] (first class murder mystery set in Belfast, Northern Ireland)  I wanted to read another good mystery novel.  I decided to go to Amazon's Top 100 Mystery novels and found Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. This book is written in a unique, fast-paced style.  It offers some very strange, often quite frightening, perspectives about the nature of marriage and this in turns leads to a complex mystery thriller. The characters are very well drawn, even if it is difficult to empathise with the two leading lights. (Lookin' at my spouse kinda funny these days!!!)<br /><br />Gone Girl is an absorbing story and the tension ratchets as Nick tries to prove his innocence of his wife's disappearance.  The language used by some of the characters can be a bit raw at times and the ending is rather tame in comparison to the earlier part of the book.  This is still a great story, however, and it is hard to understand why some reviewers have found it so disappointing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|cost perfect, easy to download,  all the family enjoy playing this game, good for all ages  thank you for offering this game
B005OCFGTO|5.0|i loved it.it got here on the day it said it would.they where not stched. they are in excalint shap
B003JTHXOK|3.0|First time reading Sparks books.  While reading I noted that it was similar to Sleeping with the enemy.  I finished the book but feel ripped off buying it.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Just finished War Horse for the second time. I read it with my seven year old daughter. It is an amazing story.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|This movie had all the drama and twists that you could hope for with just enough violence ( if such a thing exists), get some popcorn and settle in
B000MKD9P6|4.0|Over-all a great movie and cast. As always Meryl Streep pulls off a great job in her roll as a ruthless executive.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire downloaded and activated without problems on my KIndle FIre Hd.  Graphics are great and the game plays with no glitches.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story line. I haven't had much time to read for pleasure, but I was hooked. John Grisham does not disappoint!
B0039PPW60|2.0|I got this mixer because it had all the features I was looking for - and for less money than the competition. However I received two slightly defective units in a row and ultimately decided to go to a different brand. That experience was my first time having to return through Amazon - and let me say, they have amazing customer service.<br /><br />PROS: great features, lots of little touches, nice effects (great sounding reverb) and you have a lot of control over the effects parameters, really nice to have an ALT 3/4 output along with the option for a pre or post aux send, you can route the FX return to either the main or ALT 3/4 out (so you can isolate the effects return, if you wanted a completely wet signal)<br /><br />CONS: The biggest con for me was the inconsistencies between the two mixers. It may not be fair, but I was in the unique position to compare two side by side.<br /><br />Minor cons (relevant to both): the FX return, even when not using any of the effects, is a little noisy (e.g. you turn down the FX return and suddenly everything is a lot quieter), the pitch shift effect sometimes gets higher pitch digital artifacts when pushing it to its extreme<br /><br />The inconsistencies: the first had a noticeable line hum when pushing the main outs to maximum (so not a huge deal) but the second mixer had zero line hum. The second mixer, however, had dirty faders (minor static when changing the levels). Very similar to old dusty faders. While I found that slightly more unexceptible neither of these problems would have soured me one the mixer on their own. The fact that both had the same defect (unrelated to anything I've mentioned so far) along with these inconsistencies is why I didn't try for a third one and got one from a different brand.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: you get what you pay for. It seems like if you're lucky you get a good one and if not, you get a lemon.<br /><br />(In case anyone cares to find out, the defect that i experienced was only when using a poorly grounded input into the top stereo channels (at least a grounding issue is my best guess). I noticed when using an inexpensive lapel mic into one of those channels 1/4&quot; jacks. The result was very noticeable static on the channel if I touched the fader or the +4/-10 gain switch. This wouldn't happen with well grounded inputs, like my looping pedal, but it made those channels almost unless to me. (I found that if I plugged a unplugged cable into it (e.i. The other end was left unplugged) I could reproduce the problem without plunging anything else into the mixer (my method: maxing the channel volume, maxing the mains, and toggling the gain switch would cause enough noise to cause clipping. Actually, almost a decaying echo of that static noise, but now at a painful level, obviously.)) I did notice that the +4/-10 gain switch seemed to be reversed (pushing the button in made the signal louder, regardless of the input used.) YMMV, for some people this problem would not matter.)
B004HAEGP4|4.0|I always enjoy these movies, there's plenty of action . Even if you know the outcome.I will watch the next one.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. It's sure to find a home on my bookshelf in the future.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|So apparently I completely missed the fact that this was labeled in the romance genre. Contemporary romance to be exact. So while the cute cover comes off as playful and almost teen-ish (IMO), I was surprised to find it as....descriptive and to the point as it was.<br /><br />Waking Up Married is far from the most descriptive book I've ever read (and by descriptive...you know what I mean), but I don't read this genre often. And so yeah, I was a bit surprised with it's content. Now I'm not saying I want steamy, half-naked people on the cover, but the cover is way to teen in my opinion for the actual content.<br /><br />Now, on to the story.<br /><br />I was actually impressed with Waking Up Married. I expected it to be a cute, quick read with not much weight or depth to it, and while it's no psychological thriller, I was impressed with the psychology behind the story and the characters. It ended up playing on the idea that sometimes no matter how hard we try to avoid becoming one way or another, we very much end up the exact thing we're trying to avoid. And also, no matter how much we try to the contrary, sometimes we end up seeking out repetitive, destructive patterns in our personal relationships that we're not even consciously aware of. I liked that. It made the characters deeper and more real to me.<br /><br />Now I'm not suggesting that this book is at all realistic, but that's not always the point. Sometimes I criticize a book for not being more realistic and sometimes it's just nice to read for the sake of reading without analyzing every single aspect.<br /><br />I did end up reading Waking Up Married in one day. I started it probably about 8:00 pm while visiting with my in-laws (isn't that awful of me? I wasn't bored, just multi-tasking) and finished around 2:00 am the next morning. I was interested in continuing to read, but I probably could have put it down. My husband was wide awake, so I wasn't rushing him to go to bed since we didn't have to work the next day, and it just sort of worked out well.<br /><br />As I said, overall I was impressed with Waking Up Married. It ended up being much more than I expected it to be and since I wasn't expecting the descriptions I got, it was just a surprise all around.<br /><br />I'm giving Waking Up Married 4 stars. Have you read Waking Up Married? What did you think? Let me know!t day, and it just sort of worked out well.<br /><br />As I said, overall I was impressed with Waking Up Married. It ended up being much more than I expected it to be and since I wasn't expecting the descriptions I got, it was just a surprise all around.<br /><br />I'm giving Waking Up Married 4 stars. Have you read Waking Up Married? What did you think? Let me know!
0307951529|5.0|This book is very inspirational. There are tons of tips and case studies of people who have started businesses doing what they love for very little startup. Everyday people who have found their niche in the marketplace and are following their passions. The author is a great writer--if you follow his blog you will definitely love the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent portrayal of how these types of lives play out.<br />Kept my interest and very believable.  Another great book , hope the movie pan  out.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Case is a perfect fit for my daughters original Kindle Fire. She's had this cover on for about 6 months now and it still looks brand new. Great protection, durability, looks, and the folding stand makes this product 5 stars! I'll be ordering one from this company for our new Fire HD as well.
B0094KT9Y0|5.0|My children love this movie and so do I. Great characters and a good message about friendship and doing whats right.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This battery app makes it easy to keep an eye on what is draining your battery. Realistically I could check that  fairly easily anyway but having the icon on the screen means I pay more attention.<br />If you feel you have a need for this info then this app is the one to get.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved the movie and this was an affordable way to relive the experience and go deeper with the songs.  This is NOT the complete soundtrack, and is missing a few important songs. But the amazon version at $5 is more than worth it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book tells the true story of Christian grey and we find out he is not so bad after all.
0399226907|5.0|This book will fit in with the author study Eric Carle and the Science & Technology theme of Minibeasts in Term 2.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is a must see! It has everything necessary for a hit television series. Drama, action, romance. You never know what's gonna happen next! Five stars well deserved
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This app needs help!  Its as if they released it before they finished developing it.  Thankfully it only cost $0.99.  Dollar wasted, lesson learned.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Had to get this to add to my library. Loved the movie, it was, as always, very well done. The Fox animation team hit another home run with this one.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|You need to go watch all of doctor who right now, because it is literally the best show ever made.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Another top-rated Marvel hero movie for all to enjoy! This is an A+++ movie for action, emotion, good vs evil & graphics.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Go for the original, this version, when you're looking for funny. The American knock off version copies every bit, and even uses the same dwarf actor. This one has class, the other is trash.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one you won't be able to put down. Be prepared for a couple steamy scenes and some dark subject matter in the second half of the book, but the writing is outstanding and you will love the characters.

B008YU0AOE|5.0|no problems. already used to it on the iPhone. it made it easier for me to transition to the kindle.
0143112724|1.0|This review is for the illustrated edition (I give five stars to the regular, text-only edition).<br /><br />I was curious about what adding illustrations to The Elements of Style would do, so I borrowed the book from our library.  The illustrations found in the book whose authors fondly refer to as \\"The Little Book\\"  are contrary to the advise found in the book: they illustrate nothing related to the principles so clearly explained by the text. The illustrator takes a random phrase or word from the text and makes an illustration of it. For instance, the authors use as an example of Rule 3 \\"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in\\". The illustrator takes this sentence and draws a picture with that title (the picture in the cover of the book). What the doggie's drawing has to do with Rule 3 (Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas) is anybody's guess.<br /><br />From the book, \\"Rule Seventeen: Omit needless words!\\". This rule should also apply to illustrations, that is, omit needless illustrations. Because the illustrations add nothing, they are unnecessary and thus should be omitted.<br /><br />Let's stick with the text only versions of The Little Book!
B0076DELIG|5.0|It is an intelligent plot.  It unfolds in a clever manner.  The pacing is good with just enough of the personal life and the politics of a police procedural
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Seriously not worth the time. I kept hoping it would improve, but it just decended further and further into \\"potty talk\\" for grown-ups. Who needs it? I finally turned it off and found something more intelligent to do with my time.
B000002GMT|5.0|While I  haven't listened to the album I got it for my dad for a present and he loves it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Would highly recommend this game to hidden object and mystery buffs.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Great game.
159420411X|4.0|I got this book from my public library. Because of its popularity, I had to wait a couple of months, but it was worth it.<br /><br />There are already a lot of very fine reviews of this book. Generally, I agree with most of the positive reviews. I'll just emphasize that Nate Silver discusses predictions in an extremely wide range of fields. I found myself skimming through a couple of chapters that didn't capture my interest. But that didn't detract from enjoying and understanding the other material. Although some chapters make reference to others, each one stands alone fairly well.<br /><br />The author displays a lot of knowledge about each subject area he covers, and this is really part of his message -- you can't make a good prediction about something you don't understand. But likewise, if there are subjects that a reader doesn't care to understand, whether they be be Hold 'em Poker or earthquakes, those chapters in this book aren't going to be at all interesting. I recommend giving all the chapters a try, but you shouldn't feel bad about skipping some of them -- you'll still come out ahead, especially if you get the book from your library.
B0086700CM|4.0|Nine year old.grandson looooves it. But 3 year old and 61 year old wish it went just a little slower. We aren't  giving up though!. Wish it had speed levels.
1449410243|3.0|The book made a fun gift. There were probably more laughs over the act of giving the book than were were generated from reading the book, but there were some areas of the text that were funny as well. In general it held the attention and was generally humorous, but not anything exceptionally entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never write reviews regardless of all the books I read, but I had to for this one.<br /><br />This book is truly amazing and captivating.  I read it in less than 24 hours.  I could not put it down! The characters and story leave you wanting more.  This book has unexpected turns that are original and surprise you. The more you read, the more you have to keep going because it keeps getting better. I typically don't read stories like this, but I saw the great reviews and hope this one will encourage someone else to read it. Sky and Holder and great characters and you can easily feel their emotions and passion.  It's a book you'll finish reading and think about for days.  All tiny details of the story fall together in the end perfectly.<br /><br />Read it. You won't be disappointed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|this is fun, but definitely a lite version. i think I will be buying the full versions so that I can get to other levels
6304498969|5.0|A must-have for &#34;Slowhand&#34; fans. Outstanding musicianship all-around in Unplugged set, and a mature Eric really and rarely looked so smooth. Just get it, you won't be sorry.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|Please fix your app. I see people after people begging you to fix it. What does it take. If I am on my kindle and click on a picture, the screen locks and I can't get out of it. You are too good a company for such a poor application.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book a lot. I wish I discovered it a long time ago. There were some parts of the book that I didn't understand at all but other than that it was great.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It's an awful awful book that you just couldn't stop reading. The second sequel is actually worse than the first. I can feel my tolerance started to vanish. I tried to be objective and to understand the weirdness of these two characters but failed. Probly that's a sign that they are perfect for each other. I am not sure if I could finish the last one but I do hope they broke up at the end. And reading all the reviews on Amazon is just amusing, knowing that so many people feel the same way like me but still reading it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it faster than I did the first one. I love the story, the characters. They seem like real people to me. Getting ready to start the final book, and I know I will be so sad to be done with them.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I chose this rating because of the start of the book.I kept reading and found it very enjoying after all!<br />I would recomend this book to everyone!
B009E3EYMY|5.0|I LOVED IT! I have now watched the Blue Ray 4 times and the cd's over and over.  Love the Mighty ones?  Buy it, you will NOT be sorry!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was well-written, but the story was bizarre.  The story dragged at some points.  Nothing else to say but to submit this I needed a minimum amount of words.
075669812X|5.0|We have a few purchased a few of the DK Publishing encyclopedias, but the Ninjago book has been the most popular of all.  Since it comes with one of the Ninjago mini figures, it was an instant favorite in our home.  Since Christmas, our son has gone to bed every night while reading this book in his bed.  There are a lot of characters explained in the book.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon had the best price that I could find.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm not going to tell you about the plot or explain it but I am going to say that I could not put it down. I stayed up the entire night reading it and finishing it. I truly could not put it down. The story is captivating and keeps you wanting to know more. I urge people to read this book and I personally cannot wait to read the version from Travis' perspective.<br /><br />People really need to take this book for what it really is. It is a FICTION novel. It is not a book urging young adults to enter into this type of relationship. Yes there is anger and codependency and a lot of a unhealthy in their relationship. However, the story line is phenomenal.<br /><br />If you are reading for a good story, not reading to judge the material then this is a great read! I was bummed when I finished the book because I truly just wanted to keep reading.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I usualy do not pay for apps, but this one is a winner!  My daughter plays on it for hours.  Lots of different things to draw with very easy for kids to use.
B009O2XY12|4.0|this is the first game on my new Kindle and I really enjoyed it.  It is similar to another game BeJeweled and both my husband and I love that game.  I would recommend the bubbles to everyone.
B00A757EFW|5.0|OLD SCHOOL PAC MAN IS STILL FUN! PLAYED IT FOR 3 HOURS ON A LONG FLIGHT! WORTH 2.99 FOR SURE!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The Movie impacted my life in so many areas of my life. It is  a wonderful movie to learn from. Especially if your a parent
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|All the extras that you want of the  previous collections, minus the info in the first DVD (original Web Site, etc.) and the movies in HD.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice was well written and contained a lot of information for someone interested in Alzheimers without being clinical. I am a very senior individual and found some reassurance in taking the memory tests with Alice.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I never really sat down with a comic book but I know they have a big following. Of course I loved the tv show (didn't follow season 3 but ill get to it) I  know  the comic books came first. I figured since I got this new kindle I`d try out episode 1. I really enjoyed the artwork an  the ending...just wow, didn't see that coming.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob had an unusual storyline, which held my interest. I likes the way it was presented  and would recommend it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is good.its good 4 rpg players. I love this game I stayed up ontil 12 in the morning
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A very decent game, especially for free! My only complaint is the lack of control, at least that I've been able to find, over the changing layouts. But I've enjoyed all of the variety, nonetheless!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I chose to rate this book four out of five stars because while the first book was okay,I enjoyed this one so much more. The first book angered me because Ana was constantly complaining about her relationship, but would never walk out and leave. This book has all the aspects. Love, happiness, anger, sex, terror, danger, drama. Not to mention Christian revealing his past. Was great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this book in less than a day.  I agree with all of the other positive reviews.  There was definitely a few surprises in this book and the writing is wonderful!<br />For the price I'd recommend it!  It's an easy read that will make you go through many different emotions.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Every time I open it it either says there's an error or its not responding or it says its not connected to the internet. But where it works I enjoy It.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Great movie - didn't think I wanted to see it since I'm old school TV.<br />Very surprised by the way it was done.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a great team.<br />The story was well done. Great ending,  Definitely rent this movie!
0307352145|5.0|I was surprised when I overheard my husband tell somebody that this book was his favorite Christmas gift.  I love to read, and he does not typically read as much as I do.  He had a challenging year at work last year mainly because he accepted a promotion that makes him highly visible in his company and requires him to make presentations and discuss why and how his department does what they do.  He definitely prefers to be in the background.  I heard about this book and saw it in the bookstore and thought it sounded great for an introvert like him.  Since he is enjoying reading it so much, this was a successful purchase!
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Old School!  Classic.  Everyone needs to let their children watch this one atleast once in their childhood!<br />Plus, it's Disney, so you can't go wrong!
B000002P2W|3.0|The Who are a funny band. I like them a lot. They remind me of a baseball batter that is a home run leader, but also a strike out leader too - and with very few base hits in between. For my tastes anyway, there are not a lot of bands like that. I find it unusual. They either knock it out of the park for me, or they strike out. This album does not upset that trend. The home runs are: Slip Kid, Squeeze Box and Success Story - one of my all time Who favorites, and I have quite a few. But there are a number of painful strike outs too: Imagine A Man, They Are All In Love, Blue Red And Grey. I know some folks like these songs, but really... And the rest of it is pretty forgettable, but for Squeeze Box and Success Story, well... Those are a couple of pretty damn good tunes.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Full of details and a vast list of players in the story.  Not as climactic as some of his books but I thouroughly enjoyed it.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|Let me preface my review by first saying that I am first and foremost a Rolling Stones and Beatles fan. However, this is for me the best rock documentary - really, rock movie - ever made. I saw it in theaters when it was first released and was blown away. Back then there was still an intense rivalry between fans of the big English bands. Beatles fans looked down on Stones fans and vice versa. Zeppelin fans didn't mix with Stones fans and The Who fans didn't mess with either of them. You get the point, and believe me it is not much of an exaggeration - there was not a lot of crossover love between these bands fans back in the day. I had sat through a bunch of rock and roll movies before I saw this one - Ladies & Gentlemen, The Song Remains the Same, etc., but none of them ever quite captured fully the raw excitement and energy that rock and roll made us feel - until I saw this movie. For the live footage of Keith Moon alone this movie should always be held in high esteem, but what this movie captured for me was the excitement of the English bands of the Sixties, that time, that atmosphere, the mood, the fashion - all of it - all that captured the imagination of those of us fascinated by what the Sixties were, but slightly too young to have been there to participate in it. This movie captured that for me. Now this DVD reissue has a lot of great extras, and the quality is quite good and I just love it. Until this DVD came out, well, I hadn't seen the movie since that day I saw it in the theater in the late Seventies. After all that time, it sill holds up, and I am still hard pressed to say that there is a better rock and roll movie or documentary than this one.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is my favorite film series.  The music is wonderful (except I got bored sick of the Bates soundtrack during season 2), the setting and costumes are beautiful, and the family conflicts and dramas are very good.  Best of all, this is a story that is willing to actually RESOLVE many of its best stories and loose ends, unlike other series that just keep sprawling and making things always get worse and more complex.<br /><br />The characters are colorful, vivid and very clearly different from one another.  Watch this and you won't be disappointed.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I accidentally started reading this book for which my granddaughter purchased to see what material she was reading. To my surprise the pages kept turning. Exceptionally written book. I happen to enjoy dogs as family members and often wonder what is going through their minds. This book gives me pause to consider how smart they truly are!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This movie was very good.  The music and scenery are good, and there are entertaining comedic elements entwined with this adventurous family story.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I don't know which visual effects company in Hollywood made &#34;Ted&#34; come to life, but you hardly notice that he's CGI. But the humor of this film is nothing more than d**k and fart jokes.  Some of which are extremely funny. Others are cliche. If they had spent as much effort on the script as they did on bringing the talking bear to life, we'd have a great movie.  Instead, we get something that appeals more to the &#34;Austin Powers&#34; crowd.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great little mind game exercise and it's fun for anyone who enjoys challenging themselves. You'll love it.
B0081J95TE|5.0|My favorite songs are Blood for Poppies, Battle In Me, Control, Sugar. This is a great album and it was worth the 7 year wait from Garbage.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I found this book to be endlessly fascinating .It felt as if ot it was written as  a story from  the author to me. Personally ,I didn't  want to put it down .
B007HACDLK|5.0|Edge of your seat book. Love the Mitch Rapp series and this is the best yet! Kudos to Vince Flynn!

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Captivating as usual, with interesting twists and turns, combining myths with fiction and reality, always withnail-biting quality. When Pendergast is involved, expect unusual things to happen ...
B000KIPT30|5.0|I use this little headphone amp so I can connect up to 4 sets of headphones to my PS3. The unit works amazingly well and takes a substantial amount of abuse. I have dropped it on the floor probably 4 times but it feels like a tank and does not have a scratch on it.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|While this is an interesting approach to a mystery/suspense story, the crafting of the tale was clumsy and clues that were meant to be overlooked were glaringly obvious, making red herrings no more than frustrating roadblocks to the conclusion.<br /><br />The tale itself was a reinvention of a cliche, and worse yet, overly contrived.<br /><br />Yet, while terribly flawed as a work of literature, it proved entertaining enough to pull me to its conclusion in just over a day.<br /><br />No cake, just icing.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Aside from a few scenes in Batman Begins where the audio level seems to be lower than the rest of the movie, I have no complaints. The video quality is outstanding and the IMAX scenes in TDK and TDKR is the most flawless video I've seen on a blu-ray. All in all, a great purchase!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|While the prose lacks consistency in parts, the overall story was thoughtfully crafted.  With the alternating presentation of past and present events, we see the protagonist simultaneously torn apart and rebuilt.  An old story is made new through the careful development of non-polarized characters who all garner a combination of hatred and sympathy.<br /><br />The careful placement of details, all of which eventually came together in the end, illuminate the author's potential to craft a masterpiece.  While this is not that masterpiece, it is a compelling, well-constructed story that will appeal to the thoughtful and careful reader.
B008S80P38|1.0|I usually do not write reviews on music since it is very personal for everyone and I am by no means an expert on music.  But I do know what I like and what I do not like.  So.......<br />I just can't get into this album.  In fact it is sort of infuriating since I really like Deadmau5's prior work quite a bit.  Listening...listening...waiting for something familiar and interesting to come through my speakers.  Nope, horrendously boring.  These tracks stand alone by themselves and none blend together.  Most take forever to actually hear a significant amount of sound.  None of these are remotely memorable to me.  In fact this sounds like someone entirely different composed this music.  At least one of the tracks I swear sounds to me like ripped off DaftPunk.  The collaboration tracks are horrible, HORRIBLE.<br />Didn't Deadmau5 take some time off recently, but after pushing this nugget out first?  Great @#$%^.  I'm only mad at myself because I went against my usual process of listening to most of the tracks before I buy the CD.  So I ripped myself off.  This one is going in the CD box to live in my basement.  What a waste.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has created a world so intricately detailed that it is impossible to not be pulled into it.  Despite the unfamiliar nature of this post-apocalyptic world that takes place inside a series of underground silos created for the express purpose of preserving humanity, the world seems strangely familiar.  This is due to the obvious understanding Howey possesses of the human psyche.  The world has changed, but human beings have remained the same and because of this, it is easy to become invested in the various characters we encounter, despite their relatively unfamiliar plights.<br /><br />The storytelling is top notch and no stone is left unturned.  Read this and then read First Shift.  You will see for yourself that this is an instant classic that will linger in your own psyche.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|if I've ever wanted fing any information on disassembling and/or reassembling something or just wanted to watch people doing funny (and dumb) stuff Youtube can keep you entertained for hours
B0076DELIG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Very interesting characters.  About a murder that took place 20 years ago during the Watts riots in LA.  Good mix of the mystery and Harry's personal life.  Enjoyed following the procedures used by a detective in solving a crime.  In another writer's hands it would have been boring, but Connelly makes it interesting and puts you right there.  He and Harry are my favorites, the only problem is I now have to wait another year for the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this is about a serious subject, there are many moments in this novel that will make you smile.  It will also provide some insight into the various ways individuals cope while living with cancer.  I know that it will make me think twice in the future about my words and actions that may be well-meaning, but aren't really as helpful as I had hoped.<br /><br />The dialog was very believeable and the characters were multi-dimensional.  It was hard to put this book down once I started it.  I would recommend it to high school age through adults.

B009VB97EY|3.0|The movie was ok. Sexy men but the story line was not that great. I wish the love connection was more believable.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I need to be upfront here and admit something to you all - I hated the beginning of this book. As in I almost put it down. But the thought of shunning Rowling like that made me a little sad (I mean come on, the woman created the single greatest wizard series that ever existed - where was that magic hiding??), so I powered through. And then about 150 pages in (which is really quite a lot of pages to struggle through), something clicked and I really started to enjoy myself.<br /><br />I think the initial problem lay in the fact that Rowling is an amazing character developer. Problem, you say? You're crazy! You see, Rowling specializes in having a larger than usual number of central characters, whose personalities and relationships are expertly concocted. In Harry Potter (I'm sorry to keep referencing it and will stop after this - just bare with me) there were dozens of central characters, who, beyond just their personality traits, were made memorable by their names. I mean come on - nobody is going to mix up Mundungus Fletcher with Hermione or Crookshanks with Hagrid. The names are unusual and therefore tend to stick in the old noggin a little better. In The Casual Vacancy, there were still around 20 main characters, but with names like Harold and Andrew, Ruth and Maureen, I tended to get everyone confused. Hence, I needed the 150 pages to finally get everyone's backstories straight so I could start understanding what the heck was actually going on.<br /><br />As my confusion over the characters ebbed a tad, I was able to fully appreciate Rowling's talents. Each character fit perfectly into the story with a robust character and realistic flaws. The plot wasn't particularly earth-shattering - it served as a non-distracting vehicle to further develop the characters and their relationships. The story line was quite dark at times, proving that Rowling can stretch well beyond the realm of young adult fiction.<br /><br />Sooooo long story short - it's a good book. Just be prepared for initial confusion - or perhaps a character map would help!repared for initial confusion - or perhaps a character map would help!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I would have rated this book a 5 however it loses a point for the over writing in the section on the procrastinator's directorial debut.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I like these because they don't hurt my ears or fall out when I'm running like earbuds do. They are also pretty affordable!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game has totally gone way over my expectations. I love it its really fun. I reccomend getting this game highly. even though there are cash items you don't need them to complete the game. I'm having lots of fun. gameloft you have redeemed yourself with this one!!! :D

B000YHG72E|3.0|I was induced to watch this after a friend posted quotes on facebook the entire month of December. I generally don't like Will Ferrell movies, but the quotes were funny enough that I decided to give it a try. The writing was very good, and the story was entertaining. Will Ferrell, however, was again too grating for me to enjoy. If you like his movies, then you will probably like this. I would have preferred a different actor be the lead, and it would have been an excellent movie with a young Robin Williams.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. I love all of his books, but this is by far one of my favorites. It's a very captivating story about love, loss, and discovering yourself. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone!

037571457X|5.0|This book was amazing. It really shows the changes of Iran from the perspective of someone who has been through it all and presents it in a fun and interesting way. Persepolis was an extremely interesting book to read. Although it is presented in a comic-book like form, the story is very serious at times. There is also a film made about the book, which was good, but not as good as the book.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was incredible<br />Hard to put down<br />It was a very inspirational and moving novel<br />Excellent story line and wonderful.ending
014027409X|5.0|I read this book after seeing the very well known movie, A Clockwork Orange. The book is even greater than the movie, with a bit of a different ending. Both are excellent works, but I enjoyed the book slightly more. A must read for anyone who truly enjoyed the film, and just people who love great novels. This novel is a masterpiece and Anthony Burgess has written a work of art that will not be forgotten.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy this game. wish some stuff did not cost as much as it does but it is still a fun game to play.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Dear George,<br /><br />I am not happy with you. Yes, I admit it. I am angry.<br /><br />Call me a \\"fanboy\\" or whatever. Dismiss my opinion however you wish. Say the movies belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as you are so fond of repeating. And yes, legions of pro-Lucasites will come to your defense. Or make fun of me and people like me. But they are wrong. You are wrong.<br /><br />I loved the original trilogy. They were a great part of my childhood. And I still enjoy them as an adult - except for where you have meddled with them. Why, George, why?<br /><br />Why did you add a bunch of cartoony, distracting CGI junk into the background of the Mos Eisley spaceport?<br /><br />Why did you change Han's character by trying to make his shooting in the cantina more \\"obviously\\" self-defense? We already knew it was self-defense! It looks stupid.<br /><br />Why did you make it so Luke no longer says, \\"You're lucky you don't taste so good.\\"?<br /><br />Why did you change the music in several parts of the movie, especially at the end of Jedi?<br /><br />Why did you make Vader say, \\"NOOOooooo!\\"?<br /><br />Blinking Ewoks? Who gives a ____?<br /><br />Why did you take out the perfectly acceptable - and fitting - ghost of Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi, and put in a totally-out-of-place Hayden Christensen?<br /><br />Why do you keep making these distracting and pointless changes, while ignoring the things that actually NEED to be fixed? Such as Vader's PINK lightsaber, and Luke's Green-no-it's-Blue-no-it's-White-no-it's-Green-again lightsaber in Star Wars?<br /><br />I know I'm beating a dead horse here. You're rich. You're successful. You're not going to read this. You don't care. Well, you know what? I think you're arrogant.<br /><br />Just give us the original CLEANED UP, WIDESCREEN versions on Blu-Ray, and people like me will go away! But no. We're stuck with you and your lousy \\"better\\" versions of these movies. Until you're gone, at least... Not that I'm mean enough to hope for that. It's just disappointing that your pride has brought us to this.<br /><br />That's what it's all about. That's why we're stuck with these. You're certainly not above milking another blu-ray release. But you don't want to give us what we want because it doesn't conform to your pure \\"vision\\" of what Star Wars ought to be. Well, that's a load of horse hockey George!<br /><br />You're so full of yourself, you know that? You've surrounded yourself with nothing but \\"yes-men\\". I would not like having to work for you. On the extra scenes, it is so obvious that everyone around you is afraid of you... Agreeing with everything you say, laughing at your lame jokes... Do you like it that way, George? Is that what being a successful filmmaker is all about?<br /><br />I remember when the prequels were announced. I was so excited! But my excitement turned sour very quickly... Again, why George? Why?<br /><br />Why did you create Jar Jar Binks? To be funny? My kids don't think he's funny. So who does? You?<br /><br />Why did you make a prequel story that doesn't even try to conform at all to the continuity of the original movies? \\"When I first met your father, he was already one of the best starpilots in the galaxy\\", Obi Wan said. (Or something like that.) Since when does a kid driving pod racers count as being a star pilot? And Obi said he chose to take on Anakin as an apprentice. But in the Phantom Menace, he didn't choose at all. He did it out of obligation to Qui-Gon.<br /><br />\\"He was a good friend\\", said Obi in Star Wars. But in the prequel movies, Anakin and Obi don't act like they are friends at all. Obi spends his entire time griping about Anakin, and vice versa. You don't ever feel that there's any deep connection between them at all.<br /><br />Why did you make it so that Jedi have to leave their parents and be monks? So to be a Jedi, you can't be married? Huh? And for that matter, why can't Senators be married? Whatever.<br /><br />Why did you demean Yoda's character by having him pull out a lightsaber and start hopping around like a little green frog on steroids? This had to be one of the dumbest moments in Star Wars history.<br /><br />Midichlorians? What?<br /><br />Why did you put such an emphasis on the lightsaber? \\"This is your LIFE,\\" said young Obi. Oh really? I thought a Jedi's power flowed from the force. Guess I was wrong all along.<br /><br />Why did you insist on killing off any halfway interesting villain before they ever get a chance to do anything? Darth Maul? Jango Fett? General Grevious? All dead. But yeah, let keep the stupid villains like Nute Gunray, the trade Federation guy around. People are REALLY interested in him!<br /><br />Why did you keep using CGI to pack distracting cartoony stuff into every frame of every action scene? Why insist on using all green screen at all? It just looks unreal. And cold.<br /><br />Most importantly, why did you make an entire prequel story that is completely uncompelling and makes no sense whatsoever?<br /><br />At least we have the Disney movies to look forward to. Star Wars can't get any worse than it is right now.<br /><br />George, it's not too late to change. I love you. I love the first movies you made. I love the universe you created. And although the prequels can't be undone, we can put that behind us. George, I'm willing to forget about the past. All I'm asking you to do is make amends. That means please give us the cleaned-up Blu-rays of the originals. Is that really too much to ask? I'll pay you a lot for it, George. I'll even stop saying what a bad guy you are.<br /><br />Consider - you don't have to sacrifice your vision to please me. Rather than hate your new versions, I will watch them with interest to see what you've added. I'm willing to take that step in our relationship. But I can't do it until you meet me halfway.<br /><br />If you do, our future will be bright, George. Someday, you might even find it in your heart to release the Star Wars Holiday Special. Until then, I remain...<br /><br />Your disgruntled fan.
B005YVTHT0|4.0|I am entirely happy with this product, and be advised that this review is written from a vefy narrow point of view. I generally do PC flight simulations and avoid \\"platform gagmes\\" (X-box, Atari, Sega, whatever....) altogether. As a result my computer is USBd to death with throttles, sticks, pedals, gauges, add-on panels ad nausium. It's really quite pathetic. As a result a racing wheel is pretty much out of the question because of space considerations alone, not to mention having to swap out rudder pedals for break and throttle components during a gaming session. For a game like ARMA-2, Battlefield or Take On Helicopters where you can FPS, Fly, or Drive it made things a bit unreasonable. Enter the Simraceway SRW-S1 driving wheel. For me this thing is a godsend because I can set it aside while flying, or FPSing, and pick it up when entering a vehicle. Since the throttle and brake are on the wheel there is no need to swap out rudder pedals for break and throttle pedals when switching from driving to flying situations. The SRW-S1 woks similar to  a Wii controll sensing motion,and changing that movement into game motion. This eliminates the need for the unit to be mounted to the computer desk. It is much more enjoyable driving around the ARMA-2 / Operation Arrowhead landscape with this wheel than careening about with the mouse and keyboard combination. I won't review the simraceway driving game because I'm not interested in it. Others will take care of that I'm sure. I have  yet to try this thing out in TOH, I may throw another review your way for that when I get around to it. Right now I'm having too much fun driving around the mind boggeling number of vehicles in ARMA 2. All the buttons mapped just fine in the in-game profiler with the exception of the gear shift paddles which ar not supported in ARMA 2 anyway. The 3 dials don't seem to be supported either, and the LEDs at the top of the wheel don't work in ARMA eith, (BFD) which is no big deal. The throttle responseis a little uneven but that's a game issue, because the Thrustmaster Ferarri wheel I tried in the game had similar results. There is a little learning curve as the wheel is not mounted to anything and you must manually center it. You have to \\"stay out ahead\\" of what you are driving and anticipate because of this. This is similar to what you have to do when flying anyway, so it's no big deal in my not so humble opinion. Recovering from an \\"oversteer\\" will involve ditches, fences and buildings until  you get the hang of things. While not striclty \\"realistic\\" (and what FPS/Flight/Driving hybrid can be considered truly realistic?) because of the hand brake and throttle it is a lot more fun/efficient/intuitive than driving with the mouse and keyboard. I'm running Windows 7, with an over-the-hill gaming machine and this product works as advertised.  It is more effective that I had immagined. It is built well, and feels solid in my hands. Just the right size. I even bought one for my son so we can ARMA on line! Lots of fun.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|I liked this movie. There were only a couple of things about it that annoyed me. One good thing about it was it starred Will Smith, but that was also the bad thing about it.<br /><br />  Here's what I mean by that. The character of Del Spooner as written by Isaac Asimov is completely flat and uninteresting. That's true for all of his characters, come to think about it. Asimov was an idea-man. His stories were always more about ideas than characters. I've read many of his stories, and while they always had interesting plots, the characters themselves were boring and lifeless.<br /><br />  Now along comes Will Smith, and suddenly, Del Spooner has some life to him. He actually seems more like a real person, which is great! Sort of. Some small doses of what I call \\"Smith-isms\\" would have been welcome here. But as usual, he has to go over the top with it, and this gets annoying after a while.<br /><br />  What I am talking about is \\"Generic Action Hero\\" Will Smith, where he pretty much just plays himself. You take any of his characters from his movies that start with an \\"I\\", and they are all the same guy - completely interchangeable. Independence Day, I am Legend, I Robot... he plays the same guy in every one. In all of those, he needs to take his shirt off for the audience (or in the case of I Robot, also show his butt in the shower). He also needs to say a lot of one-liners. And in some cases, he'll say or do something to someone to show how macho he is, then follow that up with another smart line that's supposed to show what a tough guy he is. But to me, it just makes him seem like a jerk.<br /><br />  Like the line, \\"Hold my pie. Hold it or wear it, sir.\\" Supposed to be funny, right? But it's a Will Smith thing, not a Del Spooner thing. And it just makes me dislike the guy. It is kind of jarring, and this movie is filled with Smith-isms like that. You just have to get over it if you want to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />  I don't dislike Will Smith. I just wish he would tone it down a little. I don't really need to see his bare chest and butt - which has nothing to do with the story of this movie at all. I guess that's for the ladies, right? Except my wife watched it, and she just wanted him to put some clothes on.<br /><br />  Will Smith is like Tom Hanks in that way, where he pretty just plays himself no matter what he's in. Most people like Tom Hanks, so that's not usually a problem. Same for Will. And that's all I've got to say about that!<br /><br />  Back to the movie. I think Bridget Moynahan did a great job as Susan Calvin. Again, we had a pretty boring, lifeless character as written by Asimov. And this actress managed to rise above the lousy characterization and make Calvin seem more human. I liked this a lot.<br /><br />  Probably the best character in the movie though wasn't a human at all. It was Sonny, the CGI robot. This was really well done. One of the best highlights of the movie, IMO.<br /><br />  I'm not an Asimov fanboy who is hung up over the differences between the book and the movie. I've read the book, and I don't mind the title and elements of it being lifted to make something different. The book was a collection of short stories. It could never have been translated directly to the big screen. Instead, they just used Asimov's ideas about the future and made their own story. This worked out just fine, I thought.<br /><br />  I really liked the ideas presented in this movie. The tone of the movie felt right - except when interrupted by Smith-isms. But I learned to ignore those. I enjoyed how the movie made you think about the plot. Not everything was completely explained. I had to watch it twice before I really understood the story.<br /><br />  As far as the 3D Blu-Ray goes, I am sorry to say that I have to agree with most of the other reviewers who gave the 3D a poor rating. There is nothing wrong with the 3D in this movie. The problem is that there's just so little of it. There are long stretches of themovie where there is no 3D at all. I actually took off my 3D glasses at one point just to see if I was missing anything. Nope. The screen was perfectly clear. I was wearing glasses for no apparent reason. And then when the movie does have 3D, none of it pops from the screen. It is all just depth effects. The same effect that can be achieved with your 3D TV's auto-3D function (at least if you have an LG). Overall, it was a disappointing 3D purchase. If you have the 2D version, you're good to go. Trust me, you're not missing anything.<br /><br />  Some complained about the 3D Blu-Ray widescreen being cropped or something or other. I didn't notice anything like that, and I've seen it both ways. It seemed perfectly normal to me.<br /><br />  Also, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly is included with this disk. Here's what you get: 1 Blu-ray disk, and 1 DVD disk. When you play the Blu-ray, you can choose whether you want to play it in 2D or 3D. As for special features, I don't know the difference between this and the regular Blu-ray version.<br /><br />  Overall, it's a good movie and I'm glad I've got it. I'm not crazy about Will, but he does an okay job here. I wish the movie were less action-oriented and more cerebral, but you can't have everything. The 3D is forgettable, and disappointing to 3D fans such as myself. Buying this version versus the regular Blu-ray is pretty much no difference, except the regular is cheaper.<br /><br />  Recommended!

0316017930|4.0|Gladwell's look at success is an engaging and entertaining read, sure to be found compelling even if you are not convinced by all of his conclusions. It offers up a great range of topics for discussion but suffers from casting a net which at times is a bit too broad. He ties certain ideas together well, but it lacks focus and cohesion in the end and I found writing this review more difficult than anticipated. I undeniably LIKED the book in a way I haven't LIKED any other in some time. This is the first book I have read by Gladwell and though I was not prone to accepting his notions of how to promote positive change in the school system (I myself am an educator and I found his conclusions overly simplistic), I did find it good reading and most assuredly, fun.<br /><br />Throughout the work, I was agreeing with many of his statements and observations, nodding along and saying to myself, \\"well of course\\". I have taken enough sociology courses to find many of his observations not at all surprising. There is always a deep history behind cultural and familial success or lack thereof. Gladwell terms these as 'cultural legacies' and it is well put. What he succeeded in doing was reminding me of the power of these cultural histories and the impact that hard work (combined with no small amount of luck) can have in determining success.<br /><br />Personally, I also found this a particularly relevant book to pick up after having just finished the biography on Steve Jobs, tech giant and entrepreneur. In that book, Walter Isaacson paints an accurate portrait of Steve Jobs, focusing heavily on his undeniable genius and contradictions of character. What Gladwell reminds us (and he actually talks about him specifically), is that Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and all the other Silicon Valley revolutionaries were ridiculously and fabulously lucky. They were brilliant and worked hard, no doubt, but they were also born at just the right time, had motivated parents, and stepped into a multitude of blessings many of their peers did not benefit from. He uses this same parallel when discussing the giants of the Industrial Revolution and the hostile takeover law firms of Wall Street.<br /><br />I found it compelling enough to recommend to friends and pass on, but in many ways it is a basis for further reading and in itself will not leave a long lasting impact on most readers; he is covering too much territory for it all to sink in. I think the first part of the book (Opportunity) could have been expanded upon and turned into it's own book. The second part (Legacy) could have received the same treatment and this would have dissipated the problems of cohesion.<br /><br />If you take it lightly and walk away with a few important lessons I think you will have found it worth your time:<br />-Work hard and you will succeed.<br />-10,000 hours is a rough key to mastery.<br />-Don't be so quick to elevate those of success to the realm of gods.<br />-Don't be so quick to write-off those who suffer from cultural legacies which leave them at a distinct disadvantage in 21st century America.<br />-Consider your own cultural legacy and the way it may be benefitting you and the ways it may be hindering you.<br /><br />It is pop-psychology, sociology and history for those who may not be typically interested in such things, and I recommend it highly.

This story goes back 20 years to solve a &#34;cold case.&#34;  It shows that sometimes, the &#34;gumshoe&#34; approach wins out over today's technology.  Present and retired law enforcement officers will appreciate this book.

It certainly has worked  and got people talking i read it because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about. good for E L JAMES i admire her . if you really want to talk about something Read A FORTNIGHT OF SNOW by Eddie BEAN.  it is more than Erotic its sold on amazon .com

B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I would recommend this movie to those who want to see a horrible movie that despite the overdone action scenes still lulls you to sleep.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The only way to describe it is mind blowing. Half way through it became my all time favorite book.  Read it in 2 days. Finished 10 min ago and I'm still sitting here in shock.  I never write reviews but this one deserves more than 5 stars. Like i said, mind blowing.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|I really like my alarm clock app on my kindle hd.  Easy to read and set the alarm with a number of different sound and  I would recommend it to anyone who needs an alarm clock but can't stand the constant ticking of one.  This is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter plays this all the time and it's great. She asks for help on some of the more complex levels but has done very well on her own for a 6 year old. Great way to exercise your brain!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it. I couldn't put it down for 2 nights straight. It felt like I was watching a movie and right at the climax, I had to go to sleep. It was hard to put my kindle down.
B008MEM24S|5.0|As my daughter is a big Phineas and Ferb fan, she had to have this app. It is a very fun and challenging game. She is 6 and is able to maneuver through most of the levels on her own. Sometimes I need to jump in and help out (which I don't mind because this game is actually rather addictive). Get it today and help save Perry!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This man is at the top of his game, 430+ pages of pure drama. He has the inside scoop of DC's corruption at the highest levels and melds it with covert operations planned to their most miniscule level. Another masterpiece from the master.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham and this book does not fail to entertain!  Great story, great characters and will read again!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Like other reviewers, our copy of Brave would not play past a few minutes, the audio cut out, and the frames skipped. We were, however, able to resolve this problem.<br />If this is happening with your copy, try this: After selecting 'play movie', switch your audio to 'Channel 2'. This completely resolved all issues we were having. We were so excited!! I thought we were going to have to return our copy, believing it to be defective, but that is not the case.  There seems to be an issue with Disney and their True HD audio (which is the default 'channel 1' selection for the movie).<br />Hope this works for others--just thought I'd share.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I found it stupid. The language was over the top, way to much profanity and sexual in your face beahvior. It could have been funnier with less of both.
B00005JO5L|5.0|A very very hard to find movie. Love Al Pacino. Great addition to my collection. Recommend this movie to my friends.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful...it was a mystery a love story and a story about friendship. It's a relatable tale about growing up and about running away...

B002RI9UBS|5.0|What a lovely story, I couldn't put it down. Really gives you a lot to think about in the end.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|A Teen sci-fi movie that have to do with aliens that invade a High School to make more of there own kind and only a few students who are still humans are on there own to try to find out how to stop the aliens from spreading and ends up finding out the alien weekness and goes back to the school to find out who was the first human to be taken over by the alien and kill it to see if it'll end the invaders and stop them from spreading around the outside of the school. Great movie love the story and the actors!!

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I am still having problems w/my kindle! The charge lasts for about 1/hr, no more. The only place it charges is on my computer, which means that I have to keep it on.  After I shut it off, it will no longer go on. The kindle will also turn on by itself! and several times when I am reading a selection, it drops out and re boots and then does not start.<br />I think that it needs a new battery.  Or is this kindle set to break just after the warrenty expires?<br />I received this Kindle as a birthday present from my daughter and son-in-law fir my 70th !<br /><br />Sue Speiser<br />sidnsue2400@yahoo.com
B00005NB8K|5.0|The Doors movie is another all time favorite. However, I think that when movies are made with the aspect ratio of 2.35, they should be converted to 1.85 to fit widescreen TV's.

B00000G3I2|5.0|The Big Chill is a favorite because it brings back the sounds of the 1960's and early 1970's.  I like the funeral procession and the way they play the Rolling Stones &#34;Can't Always Get What You Want&#34; on the car stereo during the procession.  I often refer to &#34;Can't Always Get What You Want&#34; as &#34;The Big Chill Funeral March&#34;.

0307730697|5.0|I have read 7 different SEAL books.  Most were memoirs.  This is the best one out there. Period.  Read this book cover to cover.  This is REQUIRED reading for anyone who thinks the SEAL's is for them.  It will change you and the way you live your life.  As an aspiring SEAL, it has changed me.  I give my highest recommendation for Fearless.
B009JBZH54|4.0|A great price for all three movies on blu-ray, a must own for any Batman fan, or movie buff.  Arrived on time, and packaged well.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone. Danny DeVito  is at his best! The animation is fantastical! Even My  Father In Love, A retired engineer love this!

B00AMBH70S|4.0|not as good as the first 3 Bourne movies. seems to be more a side story than a sequel. also in my opinion, the chase scene at climax was a bit too long and it did not seem as exciting as other chase scenes. this is similar to the Tokyo Drift movie of the Fast and the Furious franchise, good movie, but not as good as the originals.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|really like this game. just like the old one. lots of levels,some easier than others,but thats what makes it fun.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|well, from a guy that loves action, sci/fi, thrillers, etc. this is one of the types that i would NOT own on dvd or blu-ray. To me its the kind of movie that just isnt worth watching more than once. definitely worth buying for $2 or $3 at local pawn shop or garage sale.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I fell in love/hate with Jillian because of this DVD! it's a killer workout, but I lost 20 lbs in 30 days, just by working out every day and eating smaller portions and cutting out most of the junk, but I still would treat myself every once in a while. I love this workout!
0345803493|5.0|Loved the book. I would recommend this to anyone who likes love stories. Is turns out to be more than just sex.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|Very well done version of \\"Christmas carol\\" buy it was a little dark for young kids and the older ones thought the story was a little slow. I personally enjoyed it very much
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is amazing! Read it in two days..I would recommend it to anyone wanting to read a crazy love story!
B002ZNJXP8|2.0|This story made me chuckle. It is full of cliche' and most of it is based on narrow shreds of fact. I only read Wolfe's novel because in my former profession (USAF Pilot), I kind of felt like it was required reading.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Is the equal to the spider games on Ubuntu and Windows.  Unique in its one touch moves: nicely set up for a touch screen.
B002M3SP28|4.0|I read this amazing story in two sittings. Archer did a fantastic job bringing to life the historic events of Mallory's exploits on Everest in the early 1920s. The book is full of fact and just enough fiction to entrance the reader.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I bought this movie for a gift.  It came quickly and the recipient was excited to have this as one of his gifts.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Great movie! It’s very entertaining for kids and adults as well. There are some parts of the movie that are a little scary for my 3 years old girl, but she still loves to watch it with me.
B001G7HKZ4|2.0|This is the first time I used a 24-hour rental.  I got interrupted about a third of the way through the movie and was not able to get back to it within the 24-hour limit.  The movie seemed to be good - cannot really evaluate that as I only saw part of it.  24-hours might work just fine for some folks - I personally will not do it again - it was a waste of money.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie. It's hard to keep it going so long but they managed to keep it going with a suspenseful ending!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I bought this for my daughter. She sounds muffled when talking to her. I don't think I would buy it for myself.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|Five Stars for Mitch Albom...<br />One of my favorite authors.  He writes with such simplicity yet depth into human feelings.  This story is a must read.<br />I would definitely recommend

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one night, I seriously couldn't put it down.<br /><br />It's a hard story to read in the sense that your heart breaks for the characters.<br /><br />Loved the book, will definitely recommend.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was a Christmas Gift, i was thrilled that it arrived way earlier than expected so that i didn't have to worry about it coming on time.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Key word: Survival. This graphic novel depicts how people would act when the world is overrun by zombies increasingly accurate as you read on. This is a well thought out book!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it because of the ease of use, and the available options. Does not use a lot of battery power like games will, you can read for a long time with little affect on the battery life.
B001A5HBJC|5.0|This series is perfect in every way. The first season gets you hooked immediately. Superb acting, staging, plot lines, scripts. No wonder it would go on to win so many Emmy Awards. Can't get enough of Mad Men!
B0057R5XRG|2.0|I received this set as a Christmas gift to replace my other 3 Jurassic Park DVD's.  What a piece of crap!  Universal should be ashamed to call this a blu ray and claim it is \\"digitally remastered\\". The picture quality is terrible!  Blurry and grainy.  Dinosaurs should not come across as grainy!  If I had bought this for myself I'd have returned it after viewing the first DVD.  My non-blu ray DVD's of this set look much better than this and I couldn't be more disappointed.  Amazon should pull all these or offer them for about $5.00.<br />The only reason I give this 2 stars opposed to one star is because the movies themself are great.
B000068FWC|5.0|What a great album this is. Growing up as a huge Supertramp fan, I kind of took this collection of songs for granted. That is a strange admission for someone who wore out her turntable playing the record continuously, but that is how I feel listening to it again these days, albeit in the CD format (no more skipped grooves). The title track still retains its catchy rhythym, and I remember trying to find out what \\"kippers\\" meant and why the English prefer them for breakfast. The whole album is a masterpiece and deserves its rightful place in the pantheon of great rock albums.
B009KHCT94|1.0|Watched only by husband Tim. His review--The premise held promise but it was done in by the scriptwriters. It lacked brightness. No, not the lighting. The ending was pitiful. A writing staff of 12 year olds could've done better. My wife refused to watch it & now I understand why. If I'd watched it in a theatre, I'd be howling for a refund! I'd like my money & my time back.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child knows how to keep them interesting. Couldn't put this one down. Fresh, action packed and intelligent. Does not write down to his readers. Teacher is my all time favorite character. Can't wait for the next book.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I'm not really into country music, but once I started watching the show, it started to grow on me.  It's really great.  There's only one song that I don't like (Twist of Barbwire).  Otherwise, not bad for a soundtrack with one song not to like.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|As a Halo fan, I was wary of how well this series would do.  As I watched them online, I really enjoyed them.  These are a must for any Halo fanboy.
8866134627|5.0|If you're looking for a great moleskine to put in your bag, this is it.  It's a good size, not too heavy, not too thick.  You can organize your projects nicely in this notebook.  There are also tabs if you'd like to section off your moleskine.  I actually use washi tape on the sides of the paper to section off my notebook.<br /><br />Gotta be careful with what pens you use because the pages are not thick.  I got the Pilot Precise V5 Rolling Ball Pen, Micro Point 7 and it bleeds through.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This is a great set and purchase for any Lego Lord of the Rings fan!  It's a lot cheaper too!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this app, especially the function of starting out soft and getting louder and being able to count down the snoozes.  Only problem with it is that it doesn't have weather and night clock display and that I can't get the paid version to re-download on my HTC after a reboot issue.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I really appreciated building the star it was so amazing to look at it finished. Also, the details ars so incredible they thought of every little detail that make the star as real as possible.<br /><br />thanks for Lego.

B00ABXA1HI|5.0|A wonderful apt. Especially for the classroom! I have an I- pad and know of nothing this good on it.

0385536828|1.0|As is the case for so many others on this site, McEwan is a favorite. I wait for each new book to come out. On Chesil Beach is my favorite; I wish it received more attention. But in his past two novels, Solar and Sweet Tooth, McEwan either has lost his way or is experimenting. If the latter, ok. But this last novel is simply too ironic, too meta, too disengaged for my tastes. Reconnect with the world, Sir Ian. Please!

B002MG2ATY|3.0|Oliver Stone might have chosen to present this film as a kind of imagined or alternative history, a historical fantasy or speculation making no claim to being historical truth. He chose instead to \\"write history with lightning,\\" as Woodrow Wilson is reported to have said about D.W. Griffith's admiring portrait of the origins of the Ku Klux Klan, \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" In doing so, he became perhaps the most important American historian of the Kennedy assassination--\\"most important\\" in the sense of having the greatest influence on the public's view of that tragic event. The film's claim (which Stone has defended ever since it was first released) to be presenting the historical truth is very clear, although when criticized for his many demonstrable falsehoods and distortions, Stone sometimes retreated to saying that he was entitled to \\"poetic license\\", to \\"taking some liberties with minor details\\" in order to convey a larger and more important truth, that all history was myth and that all he had done was offer \\"a counter-myth to the myth presented by the Warren Commission.\\" Like most viewers, I have no doubt that Stone passionately believed in the truth of what he was depicting: the theories about the assassination put forward by Jim Garrison (a District Attorney in New Orleans), Fletcher Prouty (at one time an official at the Pentagon) and Jim Marrs (author of \\"Crossfire\\").<br /><br />A complete listing of Stone's distortions, omissions, factual errors, and presentations of speculation as fact would amount to a book rather than a review; these went far beyond \\"taking some liberties with minor details.\\"  Here are two examples. The first is the character named \\"Willie O'Keefe,\\" the imprisoned homosexual prostitute played by Kevin Bacon. This is a completely invented character who fills what would otherwise be a very important void in the story (I was about to say \\"plot\\"). He is the only witness to a meeting that is supposed to have taken place between Lee Harvey Oswald, Clay Shaw (the New Orleans businessman prosecuted by Garrison for conspiracy in the death of Kennedy), and one David Ferrie. The person who actually offered this supposed information to Garrison was an insurance salesman named Perry Russo, but Stone here faced a difficulty: by the time he made the movie, Russo had long been completely discredited and had repudiated his own earlier testimony. So Stone invented a character who could be presented as the source of Garrison's supposed information, but who, being completely imaginary, would not leave Stone open to the charge that he had knowingly presented false testimony as fact.<br /><br />The second is the meeting depicted between Garrison and \\"X\\", the \\"black operations specialist\\" played by Donald Sutherland. This is a crucially important scene, as it provides Garrison with the Washington background that makes sense of the mysteries he has begun to unravel in New Orleans. \\"X\\" tells him that he is \\"close, closer than you think\\" to revealing the truth about the conspiracy, and urges him to bring prosecutions, any prosecutions, that will enable him to work upwards towards the more important conspirators. The trouble is that Stone has admitted that in actuality (you know, that stuff that's otherwise indistinguishable from myth), the real Garrison never had any such meeting with any such person.<br /><br />Viewing \\"JFK\\" again after more than two decades, I'm struck by the extent to which it is so completely a product of the Cold War. The picture of American politics that it offers is that found in the crudest Soviet propaganda of the Cold War era; in the climactic courtroom scene Garrison/Costner even utters that propaganda's ultimate magic word, \\"fascism.\\" What happens if an American president undertakes, or even intends, policies that threaten the military's desire for war and the desire of big business for war profits? Simple: they have him murdered by their tools and allies, replace him with a president who promises todo what they want, and then organize a second plot, a vast coverup of the original plot. Kennedy was assassinated by \\"American ruling circles which seek to harm the cause of peace,\\" as the Soviets used to put it. But to adopt the view of one's country put forward by its Cold War adversary is to stay very much inside the outlook formed in and by the Cold War.<br /><br /> Stone's adoption of this stance is closely related to what seems to be his other guiding historical principle: \\"Whatever the Warren Commission said about the assassination, the exact opposite must be the truth.\\" This is just a more explicit version of Stone's own formulation that \\"JFK\\" was a \\"counter-myth\\" to the Warren commission's \\"myth.\\" Since the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald shot Kennedy and that it could find no evidence that he was part of any larger conspiracy, it must be the case that Oswald did not shoot Kennedy, and that evidence of a conspiracy was overwhelming. It can be very tempting to think that truth must lie in inverting or reversing a once-dominant view, but it's a temptation that ought to be resisted.<br /><br />The difficulty with this \\"the exact opposite of what was previously believed must be true\\" approach is that it remains within the framework of \\"what was previously believed.\\" As Garrison says in \\"JFK\\": white is black, and black is white--what stays the same in this change of outlook is the belief that things are either black or white. So, to take a crucial political premise of the film: in the United States, is the military in the last analysis under the control of civilian elected officials? No; if the highest civilian authority acts against the interests of the military, the military institutes a murderous coup d'etat. But replacing a high-school civics dream of American democracy with a high-school civics nightmare of vast hidden tyranny is not the same thing as replacing falsehood with truth. It's a view that remains at the intellectual and emotional level of high-school civics.<br /><br />Though made with great skill, and rightly praised as pure entertainment even by many who regard its history as a mix of lies and lunacy, \\"JFK\\" is in some ways not an outstandingly good movie, even on its own terms. The depiction of Garrison's marital troubles--he cares so much about finding the truth that he neglects his family!--is trite and corny; not even Sissy Spacek can make these ancient cinematic cliches anything other than a narrative-killing bore. Garrison's climactic oration to the jury is intolerably long-winded and self-righteous, and wouldn't lead any jury to convict anyone of anything. And some of the key story lines are  incoherent. Take the presentation of Lee Harvey Oswald. He is recruited by \\"American intelligence\\" (as a teenage Marine?) to go on a special mission to the USSR, posing as a defector. There, he somehow links up with the Soviet KGB (huh?), and provides them with the information they need to shoot down the U-2 spy plane, which at that point (1960) was the CIA's single greatest intelligence asset. (Why would American intelligence do this? To wreck a Soviet-American summit conference that might have eased international tensions!) On his return to the US, he pretends to be pro-Castro, which puts him in a position to join in plots with anti-Castro Cubans (say what?). Then, he turns into a complete zero, a pawn, \\"a patsy\\" (as he called himself), someone so silent and little-noticed that he seems barely a human being at all. Certainly, for an alleged master spy, he has remarkably little suspicion that somebody might be setting him up for something. Stone's rather far-fetched idealization of Kennedy (supposedly, he would have gotten us out of Vietnam, disbanded the CIA, ended the Cold War--all the best hopes of America and the world died with Camelot!) produces a treatment that in effect strips Oswald of whatever humanity, whatever power of human agency, he had. Impossible to think that an icon of liberalism could have been murdered by a man who from his early teens understood himself to be, and proclaimed himself to be, a leftist radical! Rather, this terrible deed must have been ordered by America's hidden rulers, who for some reason recruited a bunch of New Orleans lowlifes to carry it out-- but these in turn had to work together with CIA and Pentagon \\"black ops\\" experts (couldn't the murderous military-industrial complex have relied entirely on its own highly trained killers?). Then the innocent Oswald is framed as a lone rifleman firing from a single location--framed for the work of no less than three separate teams of shooters, all firing from different places!? Does any of this make any more sense than the silliest Bond or Bourne movie?<br /><br />The three stars are for the purely cinematic skill with which \\"JFK\\" was made, because of its great influence on American public opinion, and because it's worth seeing for its unforgettable demonstration that movie-making talent on the one hand, and an interest in grasping and presenting historical truth on the other, have absolutely no necessary connection with each other. As history, \\"JFK\\" is beneath rating.f high-school civics.<br /><br />Though made with great skill, and rightly praised as pure entertainment even by many who regard its history as a mix of lies and lunacy, \\"JFK\\" is in some ways not an outstandingly good movie, even on its own terms.

B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I am a very infrequent music reviewer because I'm not really well trained in music or how to best describe it. That being said, I enjoy all genres of music and I enjoyed a couple tracks from Ellie's last album. This one absolutely knocks it out of the universe. It's pounding club beats meeting hollow sad truths-- never harsh words directly, but metaphor that is so powerful it's almost frightening. She conveys her feelings in ways that most people can't.<br /><br />There's only one track on the album that  I skip, and otherwise I play it through. It's like Adele with a club beat. It's that big of an album. Amazing.

B004NEY9EW|2.0|I have long been a fan of James Bond movies. But each succeeding Daniel Criag movie leaves an increasingly sour taste. I never bought this when it originally came out (I have all the movies up to Craig's &#34;Casino Royale&#34;) because I was disappointed with the first of Craig's Bonds. But  I started this at a cardio-cinema, was confused with what was going on and decided to watch it so I could figure it out. I did. But I didn't figure it out. Seemed like just a lot of violent action with a hard-to-follow plot. Just not good enough to have to watch it repeatedly in order to &#34;get&#34; it. Never had to do that with the old Bonds (all of them). I no longer like James Bond movies. Period. Very, very disappointing. (My spouse didn't like it either and he is the ultimate Bond fan)
