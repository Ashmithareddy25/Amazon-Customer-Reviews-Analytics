B000K7VHPU|5.0|This film blew me away.  I left the theater in a daze.  Once again Edward Norton proves his skill at acting.  He was mesmerizing in a quiet unassuming way.  I loved the twist in the end.  I would have loved the movie without the twist but it was icing on the cake.  I've recommended this movie to numerous people.  I will definitely buy it on dvd.
B000002LSV|4.0|ZZ Top is a top notch band that managed to go from the grooviest blues rock band in Texas to the most tech-adept rocker on the block. This collection focuses more on the latter aspect of their career. As a result, we're deprived with the material from their early days. There's already another compilation that handles that, so that's no loss. In addition, a recent two-CD set called \\"Rancho Texicano\\" does a good job at going over the band's  three-decade-long career. <br /> <br />All in all it makes you wonder... should I buy this? <br /> <br />The first impression you might get it is \\"No. It's outdated and it fails to represent an early era.\\" Well, yes, that's true. Other flaws are also evident. This is a compilatio that doesn't present its material in chronological order. For many of us, this a senseless and irksome characteristic. In addition, they give us a special dance mix of \\"Legs.\\" That's nice, but who said I wanted that and not the version I know? Lame. And lastly, by focusing on the later period, we have to put up with the overly stuff material that the band made after the mid-80s. <br /> <br />But the positives, in my view, far outweigh all these negatives. For every mediocre \\"Give It Up\\" there are a slew of highlight tracks. All the hits, from \\"La Grange\\" to \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" to the solid latter-day \\"My Head's in Mississippi,\\" are present. As such, the sheer amount of classics totally make the musical aspect of this worthwhile. You get about 18 tracks on this disc, and that's not bad at all. They could've fit one or two more songs before they hit the time limit, but still, you get a decent bang for your buck. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that this came out over a decade a decade ago, I still see it in many stores. If you can find it and if you don't feel like forking over the dough necessary to get \\"Rancho Texicano,\\" buy this. The hits are all present, and if that's what you're after, you'll be perfectly satisfied.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I bought this disc after watching the live performance on Direct TV about Ten times. Her music and voice are so unique and beautiful. There are several songs from this release that run through my head all the time. I love the way she changes phrasing and tempo diffrently than I have ever experienced before. Just a wonderful way to do music. The only down side is the CD version was over mixed and meddled with. I loved the simpler acustic versions on several cuts. The studio mix drowned out the lovely voice of the live version. I hope someday to see her live and experience her inn person. The song Seasons Change sends chills down my spine and brings a huge smile to my soul.

0618680004|3.0|Remember that middle aged professor who was always trying to prove he was hip by referencing pop culture? That's what I felt like Dawkins was doing with his references to Monty Python, Hitch Hiker's Guide, and such. Yes, professor, we get it. You are cool. Some of the stories were engaging, and I enjoyed the reading, but philosophically, it falls flat on its face. Atheism is a dead philosophy-- it arose, briefly during the presumptuous Newtonian era of physics, and died at the end of the Victorian age. With relativity physics and the discovery of subatomic particles, we realize that the universe is simply not knowable. There may be a God. There may not be. The subject simply cannot be approached through rational/scientific means as it lies entirely outside its scope. A far better study of the subject is called The Strongest Defense of Christianity. I read The Strongest Defense of Christianity enjoyed the way the question was posed.

B000JJS8TM|4.0|Long time Beatles fan like most readers and listeners here. Just picked it up today when it got released here in America. Bought it at Best Buy.<br /><br />I dont like the intermittent pauses in the first track \\"Because\\". But the rest of the album is just fine and dandy. You'll find some early Beatles songs in here but the album mainly concentrates on the later Beatles repetoire. This is a plus.<br /><br />DVD-Audio and surround sound features are great. On the DVDA Disc, expect only music and the tracklist menu. There are no extra goodies such as images or video or biographies or anything like that. If you dont buy this disc, the only way you can enjoy 5.1 Beatles is listening to the Anthology DVDs.<br /><br />The transitioning from song to song in this album is for the most part seamless.<br /><br />Great song selection, appropriate song lengths, good work over all on production. Some people will say that this is heresy and they should just leave the Beatles work alone. Dont pay these people any mind.<br /><br />It is said that in order to fully understand \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", you have to be under the influence of LSD. I say if you want to understand this \\"Love\\" album, you have to understand the Beatlemania, and all the adoration for the Beatles, and the excitement that people get when they hear their favorite Beatles tune. An excitement that you just can't help but dance to.
0743454537|2.0|I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I LOVE the Beatles. Always have. I did not want to like this CD. I thought of myself as something of a \\"Beatles Purist\\". My attitude was, leave these remarkable songs alone! But being an open-minded guy, I bought this CD and listened. The originals are still wonderful, but this mix is extraordinary. Hell, it's all still the Beatles! <br /> <br />What is most significant is you can hear some of these songs simply sung with little orchestration. And all the heart that went into the compositions is crystal clear. (Do not deny yourself \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\\". It's sublime!) And could those boys sing! Sometimes, it's easy to forget that. <br /> <br />Let's face it, the Beatles at their most creative used the sound studio like another instrument, just as the Martins have in this collaboration. It's very fitting and I'm sure all four of these talented men greatly approve. <br /> <br />I sure do.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|************** Spoilers ************** <br /> <br />After just seeing the movie, I'm glad to say I really enjoyed it. As it opens and we get the view of Krypton from the opposite side, I was annoyed that we only hear half of the Planet Krypton theme, and I thought it was some sort of bad omen that there would be lots of similar things that would annoy me, but actually there wasn't much that I didn't like. <br /> <br />The Jor El scenes were really well done, even though the scenes with Lara in Lester's cut are fine, Brando's Jor El really elevates them and to me comes across as more emotionally charged, because the relationship with Kal El and his holographic father was established in the first movie, unlike the relationship with his mother, also there's no pay off to that relationship, where as with Jor El's sacrifice there is in this version. <br /> <br />The screen test footage scene really surprised me, it worked far better than I'd imagined, the editing of those 2 separate screen tests is so well done, that without the changing of Reeve's hair style you wouldn't notice any other real discrepancies. <br /> <br />The Metropolis battle works so much better without the gags too, and the one bit that was left in, the man on the roller skates works alright and isn't too much because it's not accompanied by a host of other campy gags. The little Donner additions like Supermansmashing through the torch of statue of liberty and the extra few flying shots, look so cool, far better than any over the over top cgi flying scenes in Superman Returns, that zoom across the screen so fast you can barely notice them. <br /> <br />I don't miss the exclusion of the Paris sequence at all, except for the alley change, but this I accept as necessary for this version. The scene with Non smashing his way through the Daily Planet is also so much more effective in this version, the sound effects really make him sound like an unstoppable behemoth. <br /> <br />A few things I didn't like, there were plenty of lines towards the 2nd half that I noticed were dubbed even though these lines appear with the original actors voices in the Lester cut. though on the whole I liked the new sound effects, there were bits I found more effective in Lester's version, such as the Superman deflecting Zod's heat vision with the side view mirror. Also I do see now why people have complained about cutting from small scenes with Lois and Clark/Superman with large scenes of Luthor, the problem comes from using as little Lester footage as possible. Those romantic scenes at the fortress of Solitude should have been longer, adding Lester's soufflé scene would have been fine as it's in the original script and would have padded out those scenes abit, also Superman's fetching of the flower really is a scene I feel should have been left in. <br /> <br />The problems with the edited music tracks were somewhat jarring in some scenes too, besides the opening like i've already mentioned, the way its edited during the opening credits too is so obvious, but in a lot of scenes we have Williams music replacing Thorne's exact rendition of those cues and I liked that. <br /> <br />So overall there were a few things I missed in this cut, but I'll always be able to view them in the original theatrical cut, on the whole it worked better than I thought it could and it's a real delight to view all these alternate scenes, so I really enjoyed the Donner Cut.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is my favorite R.E.M. cd.<br /><br />It is very atmospheric and multi-facted. It is quieter than most of their work yet, ironically, it is also their most powerful cd. I believe this is when R.E.M. developed a full confidence and maturity as a creative force.<br /><br />There is a remarkable variety of sounds, tempos, and texures throughout the cd. Some songs have a sense of humor, some tip their hats to other classic works and some are touching examples of excellent songwriting.<br /><br />The cd opens up with \\"Drive\\" a slow, brooding musical that ultilizes a powerful guitar riff as it's chorus. It also pulls a quote from David Essex's \\"Rock On\\".<br /><br />\\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\\" is an ode to the classic folk tune \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". The song, interestingly, echos the classic riff, while at the same time, nonetheless, remains a very original song. It is one of the best songs on the cd.<br /><br />\\"Everybody Hurts is a great, anthemic song but it was enhanced and made even better by it's video which depicted scenes of redemption. It is one of the best interpretive videos of a song that I have even seen.<br /><br />\\"Man on the Moon\\" is a story about Andy Kaufman with a line that imitates Elvis (which is a bit that Kaufman used to do as well). The song rocks a bit harder than the rest of the songs with Peter Buck's aggressive slide guitar playing being a standout.<br /><br />\\"Nightswimming\\" is a piano driven song that showcases Michael Stipe's emotional lyrics.<br /><br />This is not a cd that immediately jumps out at you, it requires repeated listenings.<br /><br />Of all their cds, this offers, from start to finish, the best example of R.E.M. at their creative peak.
B000I5X81K|1.0|This is the worst CD I have ever purchased from Amazon.com.  Five of the songs are not even in English.  I am really dissappointed with it and wish I could return it.  This is the first time I have made a bad purchase from Amazon.com and feel that I have wasted my money.  I just wish I could have listed to excerpts before purchasing.  Is it possible to return it for credit?
B000JK8OYU|2.0|I'm highly disappointed after hearing all the hype. I can't believe it bought into it. I make fun of my husband for buying all the \\"new\\" Doors CDs. Like \\"Light my Fire\\" is great, but how many versions do you need. Likewise with Lady Madonna and Hey Jude. Once was enough. I wasted my money on this effort.  Well, at least, it has a new Strawberry Fields Forever. That's my consolation. Wait for it in the cut out bin.
B000A5044C|5.0|Four children (Yuya Yagira, Ayu Kitaura, Hiei Kimura, and Momoko Shimizu) must raise themselves when their irresponsible single mother (You) abandons them in a Tokyo apartment.  Officially, they don't exist; they don't attend school and the three youngest are not even permitted to go outside.  Akira, the oldest, tries to take care of his brother and sisters by carefully budgeting the cash his mother leaves and begging from her old boyfriends when the money gets tight.  He does pretty well for awhile, but as the mother's disappearances grow longer, the responsibility gradually becomes too great for even an exceptionally mature 12-year-old. <br /> <br />Director Koreeda Hirokazu has done an outstanding job, drawing absolutely naturalistic performances from his young cast, who are sweet without being sentimental or cloying.  I felt as if I had been drawn into their intimate, secret world, making the inevitable tragedy truly heart-breaking.  This is a very special film.

B000IU3Y1O|4.0|\\"Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1\\" is the fourth hits compilation from the Basildon quartet-turned-trio, but it's the first to cover their entire 25 year recording history.  With the exception of \\"Black Celebration,\\" the CD samples every studio album in their catalogue, with an unrelased track \\"Martyr,\\" recorded during the \\"Playing the Angel\\" sessions.  The bonus DVD has a collection of their music videos, though it does make a few omissions (including 1982's \\"See You\\").  There's also a documentary featuring the band along with management, producers, and former members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder.  Those who own the recently released CD/DVD reissues will recognize this clip, as it features interviews also used for the documentaries included in the CD/DVD reissues.  This hits collection isn't flawless (no \\"Question of Time\\"), but for a single-disc collection, you can't go wrong with \\"Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1.\\"
B000AARKOO|1.0|One of the standard items in the catalog of Muslim grievances is always the Crusades, which are said by Muslims to have been an unprovoked attack that is one of their main reasons for their hatred of Christians.  Since any film about the Crusades will inevitably become part of the ideological and religious battles currently going on between the West and Islam, one would think that first time screenwriter William Monahan and director Ridley Scott would be careful to be as scrupulously accurate as possible. Their choice of Iranian professor Dr. Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University, whose Wiki biography discloses no familiarity with or specialization in Medieval History or the Crusades, but does show his anti-war activism, his friendship with and the great influence radical \\"Palestinian\\" Edward Said, author of \\"Orientalism,\\" had on him, and his contention that Islamaism is a form of Liberation Theology, as chief technical adviser on this film, demonstrates for me that the writer and director had no intention to produce an even-handed portrayal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kingdom of Heaven is a prime piece of pro-Muslim propaganda that could almost have been written by the Muslim Brotherhood assisted by Leni Riefenstahl. The Muslims are portrayed as noble, principled and physically clean, the Christians are portrayed as base, unprincipled and filthy.  The King of Jerusalem is a leper, symbolizing the corrupt nature of Christian rule and the one high ranking Christian prelate we see is an officious coward.  Saladin's advisors are refined and cultured, the Christian knights are a snarling pack of hyenas, fighting over the plunder they have come to the Holy Land to steal.<br /><br />Crusaders are fanatical, rabid killers using the Crusades as an excuse to slaughter, rape and plunder.  Saladin has come to \\"retake\\" Jerusalem and cleanse the land that has been \\"defiled\\" by Christians (never mind that Jerusalem was originally Jewish, then Christian land that Muslims had captured, was retaken by Crusaders, and that this was the land Saladin was coming to \\"retake\\"i.e. conquer again. When Saladin's polished, very orderly army appears, beautiful flags waving in the wind, it is a stirring sight.  Except for their well-dressed but fanatic, psychotic and mostly repellant leaders, the brutish Crusaders are shown wearing filthy, worn-out clothes and equipment and look like a disorderly rag-tag collection of vagabonds.  Unscrupulous Christian knights scheme against the King, each other and the peace, while Muslim leaders exude honor.  Knights sadistically brutalize and kill, Muslims read the Koran and look at the horizon thinking deep, pious thoughts. Orlando Bloom's love interest, Sybilla, the Queen of Jerusalem, is a slut who causes a war because of pique.  Saladin's sister, who is deliberately raped and murdered by fanatical Knights Templars to break the peace and instigate a war with Saladin, is shown as a dignified woman who accepts her fate with calm.<br /><br />After days of fighting Saladin takes Jerusalem and magnanimously grants the survivors safe passage out of the Holy Land.<br /><br />There is only one slight problem here, this film is so one sided and historically inaccurate that it is propaganda.<br /><br />We are never told about the 400 years of ongoing Muslim aggression, slaughter, looting and conquest that resulted in them conquering the majority Christian countries and territories--peacefully converted to Christianity by apostles and missionaries in the centuries after Jesus--of Jerusalem, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan,  Mesopotamia, Armenia, Anatolia and Spain, prior to the Crusades.  Nor are we told of the fate of the surviving Christians, who their Muslim conquerors made either slaves or semi-slave \\"dhimmis.\\"  Not only was it Muslim attacks on Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land they had sworn to provide safe passage to, it was Muslim's ever expanding territorial aggression and constant raids andattacks--Muslim forces forcing their way deeper and deeper into Europe over the centuries--that provoked the almost 200 years of Christian counterattacks that were the Crusades.<br /><br />The Crusades, as badly managed, often fratricidal and ultimately futile as they were, were not the mostly ignoble scramble for loot and butchery that this picture portrayed. To fight in a Crusade was a religious obligation and many wealthy knights sold off their lands and property, pauperizing their families, so that they could equip and transport a body of fighters to the Holy Land to fight for its liberation.<br /><br />In contrast to the sadistic killing sprees of the Christian knights depicted, Saladin is shown executing only one person, the killer of his sister.  What is not shown is the fact that after his victory over  the Christian knights and foot soldiers at the Battle Of Hattin, which opened up his way to conquer Jerusalem, he sold all the surviving common soldiers into slavery and attempted to forceably convert all the surviving Knights Templars and Hospitalers to Islam.  When they all refused he had members of his army, unskilled at executions, behead all his prisoners while, according to one chronicler Saladin \\"watched with a glad face.\\" As for Saladin's magnanimity, historical records show that he forced the wealthy survivors of Jerusalem to pay a ransom to obtain safe passage, he freed a few other survivors, and he made the remaining Christian and Jewish men women and children slaves.<br /><br />I gave this picture one star for its great cinematography and soundtrack.
B000F4PD7G|5.0|This is a wonderful old fashioned tale. Beautiful icelandic scenery, <br />strong cast, headed by the charismatic and perfect Beowulf, scotish actor Gerard Butler. <br /> <br />A very striking film visually, with a different perspective to the Beowulf <br />story. Very worth seeing. <br /> <br />Also there is a wonderful documentary called Wrath of Gods that shows all the amazing things the crew went through to film Beowulf and Grendel, it makes you admire the film even more. A real test of determination. I must get Wrath of Gods when it comes out too. By Jon Gustafasson, a great looking documentary. <br /> <br />Rose
1591840562|4.0|The subtitle of this book is 'Guide for Anyone Starting Anything'.  In contrast, this book is clearly about startup companies and entreprenuring.   Though, it's quite useful, I liked the author's style (easy to read, no fluff, just stuff).
B0002S94OS|2.0|I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts. <br /> <br />However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I finally got a chance to see this movie and I loved it!  We laughed, we cried and we were so happy we went.  It was uplifting, entertaining and just plain fun- I can't wait to own it!
B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you're looking for a daring album of Beatle mash-ups -- such as Dangermouse's Gray Album, CCC's Revolved or any of djBC's Beastles tracks -- you're going to be disappointed. This album is nowhere near as expectation-shattering as those projects, nor was it meant to be. <br /> <br />This recording is actually a soundtrack for the incredible Cirque du Soleil show. And in that respect, it performed exquisitely. Having seen the show, I can say that it re-imagined the music enough to find the proper balance of maintaining the integrity of the original while reinvigorating them with elements that are at once surprising and familiar. This provided the base for the Cirque troop to provide wildly imaginative visual performances to the music we all know and love. <br /> <br />Apart from the Cirque audience, this compilation deserves a listen by other groups as well: including the lifelong Beatles listener who has heard the songs a thousand times over and is hungry to hear some fresh (but faithful) elements injected into their old favorites. <br /> <br />I would also choose this compilation as an introduction for younger listeners who know little-to-nothing about the Beatles. I favor this recording over \\"1\\" or the \\"1962-1966\\" & \\"1967-1970\\" sets for several reasons. The remastered sound quality is in league with contemporary recordings and the remixed mash-ups favor a more contemporary taste. Listen to the explosive \\"Get Back\\" version augmented with the opening chord from \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" instrumental solos from \\"The End\\" and the apocalyptic crescendo from \\"A Day in the Life\\" to hear exactly what I mean. Most importantly, rather than merely being a collection of their \\"greatest hits,\\" this album strives to paint an sonic portrait of the band. <br /> <br />A final plea that will no doubt fall on deaf ears: Don't buy this until you've seen the Cirque show! This music is half of a cohesive, masterful show. Listening to this album beforehand is like reading spoilers of thebiggest movie of the year before you have a chance to see it yourself. It is because of this fact -- that this music functions better as half of show -- that I can't give it a full 5-star rating.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Many of the songs really do sound like new songs \\"by the Beatles\\"! Get Back, in particular, is awesome! George and Giles do a great job of others songs too, like Strawberry Feilds Forever (with a very cool out-tro), Lady Madonna, Glass Onion, and others.  <br /> <br />Listening to it now on CD I'm really amazed with the sound...I don't think I can go back to the previous Beatles releases after this!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have been awaiting this day for months. I saw the show \\"Love\\" at the Mirage in Las Vegas this summer TWICE! Now, nothing can replace having the experience of this album on 6,000 speakers in a theatre built just for this show, however the Surround sound disc comes very very close. <br /> <br />The really neat thing about this album, even for the Beatles purist, is that you don't own this music. Period. Not only is this an 80 min score of continous music, rather that track by track, BUT this is the FIRST TIME EVER that the orginal MASTER recordings of these songs have ever been release by Apple Inc. to be fully digitized and set into surround sound. If you own a \\"digitally remastered\\" album by the Beatles, that just means they remaster the album as whole. Here, George Martin and his son have been give the chance to not only blend but remaster each song they way they were set down at Abbey Road, as individual tracks. Vocal track. Drum track. Guitar...etc... <br /> <br />Here is exsample of some of the cool stuff they had a chance to do... <br /> <br />Gerorge Martin.....on Track 13 Strawberry Fields Forever <br /> <br />''We spent more time on this than anything else in the show. Dominic (Champagne, the show's director) wanted something to show the creative process on stage. We found as many versions as possible, starting from his first recording at home -- Yoko had the tapes. We spent all this time finding versions and matching the keys -- with one take coming under another, all overlapping, always more than one going at all time. <br /> <br />''We were under pressure from people to change things, to make things different. Ringo loved this -- he loves anything where I have his drums up. Paul said, 'I'm pleased, you've been so sensitive to what the Beatles are about.' It's the best job in the world to have license to play around with all these masters.'' <br /> <br />George Martin is aslo quoted as saying this is as close as you will ever get to hearing The Beatles LIVE.  <br /> <br />So buy it now!!!
0143036556|5.0|Anyone who calls himself/herself an environmentalist should read this book.  It should be considered one of the great environmentalist books of our time, even though Jared Diamond does not intend for it to be so; he approaches the subject as a scientist, and his conclusions illuminate arguments for responsible stewardship of the environment, from the front yard to the whole planet.  I liked it better than Guns, Germs, and Steel.
B000JJ4GW0|2.0|After having released the 1980-1990 & 1990-2000 Best Of Compilations, it seemed logical that the next U2 compilation would be a 2000-2010 compilation. With 2-3 leftovers from All...Behind, 4-5 contenders from How...Atomic Bomb, and the new single with Green Day (eh hem), not much would have been needed to fill that quota. Apparently, U2 no longer have such patience and have delivered this single disk career overview just in time for Christmas.     This is a pattern that has increasingly been developing by U2, i.e. releasing recycled material of sorts between each new release. We've had this decade alone 3 concert DVD's (plus Zoo TV re-released) and the 1990-2000 CD & DVD compilation.     On the plus side, at least for the very casual fan, all the biggies are included on this set. For those who have been Following U2 for ages, it is highly unlikely that such fans will have any Desire listening to Pride One more time (included on each concert DVD). Granted, there are 2 new tracks included but the average price for each new song for those who own U2's previous material, probably in many shapes, is steep.     The song selection is, as a set for casual listeners, as close to perfect as possible. U2 have e.g. skipped all the songs from the Pop flop; as are Zooropa and the first two albums (meaning that I Will Follow is not included, a hidden track still on the U.K. version). 2 UK #1's, The Fly and Discothéque are also nowhere to be found here, indicating that the songs are chosen by their world wide success. There are obvious misses, such as City of Blinding Lights, Numb and Angel of Harlem, but which songs to replace them with would be a difficult task.     This edition includes a \\"bonus\\" concert DVD including a staggering 10 songs. Many U2 fans already own, however, the Vertigo DVD filmed during that same tour (not same concert), making this more of a purchase to satisfy those who need to own everything officially released by U2, which is becoming proportionally ever more difficult in a similar degree as their declining rate of new material.     U2 fans (me included) probably will, with a slight grumble, purchase this set en masse. With the entire catalogue yet to be re-released, however, patience with their recycling efforts may begin wearing thin if this process continues.     I would give this set 5 stars for the songs themselves, they do stand the test of time (having heard many of them so often, I hardly will listen often to this set). There are, however, only a couple of stars given to the 18 release itself (in light of the baffling few songs on the DVD, that may be generous) , due to U2's abnormal recycling efforts, which should be concentrated more on earth's resources, not their back catalogue.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|One of the best metal albums of this decade. Second only to Vs The World for this band. Production quality is the best yet, and you can tell the band worked very hard to give us a true metal tour de force. Johan proves once again why he's one of the best in the business. His delivery is brutal, but somehow clear enough to understand, which is rare for a death vocalist. The Soderberg/Mikkonen guitar duo should get a grammy for this effort.  These guys keep putting out pure, crystalline metal, album after album. And the rhythm section of Andersson and Lundstrom could not be tighter, providing the band that classic Amon Amarth \\"wall of sound.\\" <br /> <br />There are no bad tracks on this CD. Highlights are Runes to My Memory, with a great chorus riff that just sticks in your head; Gods of War, where the first 2 minutes alone are just glorious viking metal; Asator, unreal riffs; and With Oden On Our Side, which seems to raise the gods from their slumber by itself! <br /> <br />Amon Amarth is able to do what many bands cannot- they innovate within their genre. These guys know where their strengths are and keep hammering away at it! Yet, their true gift is that they can give us these great epic metal assaults over and over without sounding stale. Each album is unique, but all are still connected with familiar themes: vikings, norse gods, battle and adventure. Combine this with some of the best riffs ever devised and you get classic metal for the ages. <br /> <br />
B000IMV4IW|4.0|For those thinking this is the definite Oasis singles collection, take a look at the songs NOT included (highest U.K. chart position):  <br /> <br />Shakermaker #11  <br />Whatever #3  <br />Roll With It #2  <br />D'You Know What I Mean #1  <br />Stand By Me #2  <br />All Around The World #1  <br />Who Feels Love? #4  <br />Sunday Morning Call #4  <br />The Hindu Times #1  <br />Stop Crying Your Heart Out #2  <br />Little By Little #2  <br />She Is Love #2  <br />Let There Be Love #2  <br /> <br />Their web site states: \\"The tracks as chosen by the band themselves - the songs they believe encapsulate their remarkable career to date.\\" For many though, omitting all these tracks (no less than 3 number one hits) is rather excessive. Actually, this track list would make most bands proud of their achievement. Usually when tracks are omitted on such greatest hits compilations, those are one or two songs the band just simply hate (case in point is the recent R.E.M. In Time compilation which skips Shiny Happy People) or more often minor hits or known album tracks.  Not one track from Be Here Now is included but over half of the tracks here are from their first two releases, incidentally the albums most people already own. <br /> <br />This is not to say that the songs on this compilation are not superb, they are.  On that strength I give this set 4 stars (I am probably generous).  There should, however, be a warning sticker on this release stating that this is merely a compilation, nothing more.  An alarming case in point is the track Whatever, which has only been available as a single. This begs the question, why is there not a double CD version of this release?  Ooops, actually this is a double CD release with simply very few songs on each CD compared to the compilation norm.  Maybe this is some kind of retro attempt.  In the age of programmable music, I'd rather be able to edit my music down to my personal choices of nine songs as opposed to being limited in that option.<br />
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Just picked this up and haven't even listened to every minute of it yet, but as a lifelong fan (I was 12 when The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan), this album is awesome. The mixes of one tune into another aren't offensive, Each tune is so crystaline, it sounds like it was just recorded last week. By the way, the liner notes claim that these mixes are from original masters. Someone did a great job of preservation and George Martin deserves a Grammy for this work. Highly recommended to fans, but maybe not the right introduction for newbies. Now I HAVE to see the Cirque production.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Ben Moody must have been a huge asset to the band because I loved every single track from Fallen yet there were 2 songs from this album that got under my skin and a few others I could really have lived without.  Well obviously Moody was an asset to SOMEONE since he has moved on to help another star rise to new heights with his talent (Kelly Clarkson: Because Of You).  He also helped Avril Lavigne w/one of her songs which was just OK.  Both band & man are successful & kudos to even more success to each of them!<br /><br />The Open Door is still great so by all means so give it a chance.  There aren't enough words to describe the beauty of Amy Lee's voice.  As a soprano myself I was quite impressed with the high notes she hit both in as backround chants (ex:track 3) & in the melodies (ex: track 1) because you don't usually hear those kinds of notes unless you're listening to opera or Celtic music or something along those lines.<br /><br />The songs have similar dark, deep & haunting overtones as Fallen.  Both the fast & slow tracks showcase Amy Lee's HUGE vocal talent.  It just shines even more in the slow ones.  Don't miss Track 4: Lithium.  Although I can't relate to the USE of drugs as in the song itself it is still very, very deep.  And it's not like you have to be in a drug or alcohol induced blur to feel the pain she does when singing this song anyway.  In my younger days I listened to music as therapy for a heartbreak and this one would have fulfilled that category.  Even WITHOUT a heartbreak it's still a part of my daily music-listening playlist.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Here in Australia, it took Network 10 about a year to put the second season of Veronica Mars on TV. So before i watched it on television, i bought the DVD. I must say, this is by-far the best season of Veronica Mars. Its full of plot twists and turns. I cannot wait unitll the thrid season because i want to see what happens to Veronica and Logan!
B00005JPCA|3.0|And trust me, I'm one of the ultimate James Bond fans.  I know the character, the books, and the films very well.  Does that make me an expert? No.  But I do feel I can comment on the film.  It was not one of the best Bond films, just average.  But it had potential to be one of the best.  Don't get me wrong.  I liked the film.  It had some awesome stunts that have been sorely missing since Goldeneye and before that.  The locations were excellent.  The action awesome.  The story brillant.  The villians very cool.  And the girls beautiful and smart.  All elements of an exellent Bond film.  But three elements held it back.   <br />1. The critics overhype Craig's performance.  They claim his Bond is closest to the novels.  Not so.  Timothy Dalton's performance was actually closets to the Bond of Ian Fleming.  He took the time to read all the books, to look into the character and to get a feel for how Bond operated.  Craig on the other hand just played the role as he felt Bond should be played.  I understand the producers wanting to break away from the traditional Bond.  But this Bond is actually more reckless than Ian Fleming's.  But Danial Craig does have potential to become great as the character. <br />2. While I don't mind a breaking away from the formula of Bond and trying new territory, please don't mess with certain things that give it the feel of a Bond film.  The first is messing with the gun barrel logo.  This has been used at the very beginning of every Bond film.  To change it takes away from it feeling like a true Bond film.  Second, the gadgets.  They are essential to James Bond as a character on film.  I know it wasn't like this in the books, but we're talking about film.  These are what make it a Bond film. <br />3. And finally, the movie was too long by 15 minutes.  This is what really made it miss it's target.  It was the longest Bond film ever made.  I guessed the ending of the movie long before it happened simply because scences in which ran too longalso gave too much plot away.  Simply put they would have made great deleted scence for DVD.  And other certian scence just seemed out of sequence to the movie's pacing.  Case in point the shower scene.  Right after a major action scene, Bond sits back down at the poker table, but before anything happens, it cuts to him entering the room before the story resumes and then proceeds into a useless scene that really had no point to the story.  I could point out several more little things that could have gone, and made this a terrific Bond picture.  Main point: Too Long!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|In the Music Industry, few releases generate the controversy among fans as the release of a new Beatles album. There are those who welcome it and those who, for some justifiable reason, reject it. This is my take: The Beatles have an extensive catalogue of great songs (perhaps the greatest catalogue in Music History...) anyway, we all know that half of them are dead and we will never hear a new recording from them ever again. They are gone. Deffinately gone.<br /><br />And yet, we fans never get tired of them. We always listem to their songs as if they were here. For us, they are not a band with half their members dead. They are very real and living. And deep inside I believe we never really think we'll never hear from them again.<br /><br />LOVE is an album where several of the Fab Four's greatest songs were remixed, remade and adapted for a great show put on stage by Le Cirque du Soleil. Wisely, this soundtrack was made by George Martin himself... with Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko's blessing. I am sure that, like in everything regarding The Beatles' releases, all the people involved with this are hard working and serious people commited to give us nothing but the best treatment of the greatest material ever composed in pop music.<br /><br />So, for me, this is a great thing and we'll never have anything better than this. People (like myself) may prefer the original songs... it's ok. But we must also understand that this new album is not meant to replace the older, original recordings. They are a just the soundtrack for a stage show... made by the best people we could think of... and made with the blessing of those could bless it. I was lucky evough to get a copy of this today... and after listening to it back to back... I was very very pleased to hear the great work they made.<br /><br />All the songs sound beautiful with lots of new insights and several propositions that must work very well on the stage. This album gives a new view at these classic songs. For example... joining ELEANOR RIGBY (my favorite Beatles song) with a transitional use of JULIA is a very interesting proposition that the Beatles never thought of doing, obviously. Or the putting together of BLACKBIRD and YESTERDAY is another example of the experimentations made here.<br /><br />The treatment of WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS is, I am sure, the thing that would end up happening with the song if the Beatles (in the end) did not go for the well know \\"heavier\\" approach we listen to on The White Album... and I'm glad George Martin did it here... because, since the Anthology, I'm sure we all thought of that.<br /><br />This album is the closest thing we'll ever get to a new Beatles album... and it will certainly bring new fans into our club. I am very happy with it... and I am thankful that more than 35 years after these recordings were all made, people are still fiding in them new sources of inspiration. This album should NOT be mistaken for those hundreds of lousy cover/homage albums made by third rate people (The Beatles Salsa... or the Beatles go Reagge... etc)... or those bootleg albums whose sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Like the great Anthology series, the Capitol box sets, the \\"one\\" album, and the \\"Naked\\" album, Love is an obvious labour of passion, care, taste and love. It is a great celebration of the music we all love... from four musicians who are eternal.y favorite Beatles song) with a transitional use of JULIA is a very interesting proposition that the Beatles never thought of doing, obviously.

B000J103X4|1.0|Why does Game have to use almost the same exact cd cover as his other trash ablum?  Can't a rich guy like him even come up with a new ablum?  Game is soft and his raps are not reality like all G-unit lyrics are.  If Game didn't have G-unit beef, he would not be making 70% of his songs!  This ablum is garbage.  I would not reccomend it.
B000HCPU0Q|3.0|I grew up on these singles; I had 85% of them in vinyl upon release, particularly the early ones.  The excitement around a new Clash single was intense for me, and they always delivered the goods, so I won't argue the artistic merits of this stuff. It sounds phenomenal in this configuration, and pretty much always will.  What I am completely disappointed in is the lack of detail in what basically is a coffee table edition (supposedly definitive) of these great singles.  In the vinyl version of \\"The Cost of Living EP,\\" Strummer goes on a great improv rant for about 30 seconds after \\"Capital Radio 2\\" over the backing track to \\"I Fought The Law,\\" nattering on about how he is Eraserhead and he will rub you out, and then sums it up by screaming \\"this is the COST OF LIVING EP!!!!!\\"  Where is it?  \\"Capital Radio\\" peters out to a close, no Eraserhead, no final words from Joe, nothing but the deafening silence of feeling hosed by a multinational corporation.  Small trifle, yes, but at this price????  I bought this thing for completeness, and complete control should have been the order of the day.  Love the music though, it's absolutely forever.  RIP, Mr. Strummer.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|I really went back and forth with this film.  In the end, though, I just couldn't get past the fact that even a good script based on the work of a literary genius like Oscar Wilde just can't overcome the deleterious effects of problematic acting.  I can't bring myself to say bad acting because I think Scarlett Johansson is a very good actress and - while I don't really care for her - Helen Hunt is as well.  Neither was very good in One Good Woman, however.  The blame must really fall on the director and casting director, though, as neither actress really belonged in this film.  Helen Hunt may well have tried too hard to fill the role of the adventuress, man-chasing Mrs. Erlynne, resulting in a slow and careful (sometimes stultifying) delivery of dialogue that gives rise to no feeling or charisma whatsoever.  With very little charm at her disposal, it becomes difficult to believe that so many men fall so easily under her spell.  As for Johansson, she seems totally out of her element here, clearly uncomfortable throughout many a scene.  Fortunately, Tom Wilkinson and the fellows I affectionately call \\"the old geezers\\" come bearing the quick wit and natural bearing called for in this type of satirical treatment.  That allows the script to shine in places, thereby saving the whole project from disaster.<br /><br />Clearly, this film takes many a liberty with Oscar Wilde's classic drama Lady Windermere's Fan, yet it still wields quite an impressive sword of satirical wit here and there in the script.  The story is basically an attack on the hypocrisies of gossip vis-&agrave;-vis high society, something Wilde knew quite a bit about.  Lady Meg Windermere (Scarlett Johansson) is a young newlywed living in idyllic bliss with her husband Robert.  Wealthy, attractive, and well-to-do, she thinks she has the perfect marriage to a man she trusts implicitly.  Then Mrs. Erlynne shows up, having left New York rather hastily, courtesy of several wives anxious to see her depart from their husbands' lives.  Mrs. Erlynne has always relied (and indeed prospered mightily) on the kindness of strange men, earning her quite a reputation in 1930s America and, rather quickly, Italy.  She and Robert Windermere are soon the hot topic of local gossip, with nosy well-to-do women tracking their private meetings and going quite apoplectic about it to one another.  When word finally filters down to her, Meg is quite stunned and contemplates some rather rash action of her own.  Meanwhile, dear old Tuppy (Wilkinson), a man with his own share of past social indelicacies, quite falls for Mrs. Erlynne and proposes marriage - to the chagrin of all his marriage-hating buddies.  These are the lovable \\"old geezers\\" I was talking about, and they constantly delight the viewer with short, stinging, and remarkably witty complaints about the institution of marriage.<br /><br />I won't attempt to chronicle the shifting layers of this film, for the plot takes a number of delicious turns along the way.  The plot's solid, as is the writing.  Indeed, I would sometimes find myself pulled into the story rather engagingly, but the magic always departed once Hunt and/or Johansson turned up for a more serious scene.  That proves to be too much for this film to overcome.  Yes, it's always a treat to reexplore Victorian sensibilities (even if they're arbitrarily shifted to 1930s Italy), but A Good Woman never exhibits the first sign of life or energy, plodding its way through a story that could have and should have been much more enjoyable.husbands' lives.

1594200696|5.0|This jazzy edition of the classic \\"The Elements of Style,\\" by Strunk and White, features stylized, exuberant, riotously colorful, and often whimsical illustrations by Maira Kalman.  In addition, a few references have been changed to make the book more relevant.  For instance, in the earlier edition, the authors cautioned against the use of acronyms with this example: \\"Not everyone knows that SALT means Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.\\"  The new edition states, \\"Not everyone knows that MADD means Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\\"  In the section on slang, Strunk and White advised writers to use standard language and avoid such words as \\"uptight, groovy, rap, hangup, vibes, copout, and dig.\\" In the new edition, examples of slang are \\"psyched, nerd, ripoff, dude, geek, and funky.\\"  Strunk and White advocated \\"using scissors on the manuscript, cutting it to pieces and fitting the pieces together in a better order.\\"  In the current edition, writers are encouraged to use a word processor to move text from place to place.<br /><br />Is a new edition of this handbook really necessary?  I believe that it is, not only because of the archaic references that needed updating, but also  because today's younger writers need visual stimulation and pizazz to capture their attention; this edition has both.  Strunk and White's words of wisdom are, for the most part, reprinted as they appeared in earlier editions.  The authors discuss such topics as elementary rules of usage, principles of composition and form, words commnonly misused, and tips on how to develop an effective and natural style.  Even experienced writers would do well to review \\"The Elements of Style\\" now and then to remind them of the importance of clarity, brevity, simplicity, and consistency.
B000002V07|4.0|The first song on the album is worth the purchase price alone..Great Cd if you want to just relax and chill....It lost one star because sopme of the songs just sound to hippyish and take away from the relaxing vibe and just get annoying.........but like I said....get some wine, buy your girl a gift and put track one on repeat.....Guaranteed sex  ;)
0618680004|5.0|In case the title was not sufficiently obvious, in \\"the God Delusion\\" Richard Dawkins argues that belief in God is a mistake or error of thinking that is sufficiently \\"weird\\" to be considered a delusion, from the point of view of a non-religious person. The book particularly focuses on belief in, and arguments for, the Christian/Jewish/Muslim God, but the same objections Dawkins raises could be directed toward all the other gods people have worshipped throughout history.<br /><br />\\"The God Delusion\\" is the second book by Dawkins that I've read. I read \\"Unweaving the Rainbow\\" some years ago, and I had forgotten since reading it that Dawkins is a fantastic writer. He writes clearly but is not too dry or scientific. And, despite talking about complex subjects, he does not artificially \\"dumb-down\\" his language. Whether you agree or disagree with the points Dawkins makes in \\"the God Delusion\\" one thing I can assure you of is that you won't be unsure of what his points are.<br /><br />The God Delusion explores a range of topics including:<br />1. The philosophical and empirical (especially evolutionary) arguments for and against the existence of gods.<br />2. The association between religion and morality.<br />3. Objections to organized religion.<br />4. Justifications for atheism.<br /><br />If, no matter what anyone says to you, you will not give up your belief in a god or gods, or a particular religion, this book will simply offend you and you shouldn't waste your time. However, if you are genuinely interested in the question of the existence of a god or gods, and the reasons why people follow religions, you will most likely find this book fascinating. Even for people familiar with this topic, I'd recommend the book because it raises some genuinely new arguments that have not been explored in other books about theism vs. atheism. Finally, Dawkins has answered, within the book, most of the objections raised many of the other reviewers, as such I'd encourage people to buy it and read it to make up their own minds.own minds.
B000007491|5.0|Long before \\"Crime Of The Century\\", I bought a promo copy of their 2nd LP (\\"Indelibly Stamped\\") and fell in love with the quirkiness of the music and Roger Hodgson's voice.  I quickly discovered their first LP \\"Supertramp\\" and became a died-in-the-wool fan long before they got big.<br /><br />This CD is an exact duplicate of the once-available US issue.  Great sound and nice, crisp highs.<br /><br />It's musically more melancholy than later albums, but anyone who loved Supertramp during their big-hit period will find this a welcome addition to their collection.<br /><br />It's just a shame it's so expensive!

Well, I wish it was longer!!!

B000ASDFJU|1.0|Apparently there was a problem wherever these discs were manufactured, because I, like many other shoppers on here, have had to return my set due to malfunctioning Season 3. <br /> <br />Which basically means that, if you order this set, you need to watch every disc in its entirety within the 30-day return window.
B000J4OYRW|5.0|I had the opportunity to purchase this DVD several weeks ago from the UK and all I can say is AMAZING! From where they grew up to where they went this is by far and large the definitive documentary of the Pet Shop Boys. Superbly produced with tons of interviews including Neil & Chris this is a biography of the two and the musical entity they became. Celebrity musicians, critics, producers, and British television personalities all chime in to contribute their thoughts, feelings, and reflect upon the influence the Pet Shop Boys have had on the music industry. Produced by the BBC it also includes the videos for the last 5 singles released (from POP-ART & Fundamental). If the content is the same as thr UK version I had a chance to buy earlier then this is most definitely one of the most insightful productions for any fan. And I venture to say you've never seen Chris Lowe talk so much..........
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Why mess with the greatest music of the 20th Century? To put together another compliation of songs everybody already owns? I am one of the biggest Beatles fans in the world, and this is sacrilege. What they should have done is just remix their old albums and re-release them. Sorry, but this is a classic disappointment and a waste of money, even with surround sound.

Am I the only one who's missing the poster offer? A sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within. Well I don't see it...
B000HT386M|5.0|I recently rented this movie due to the fact I needed a compremise between myself and my fiancee. She ususally picks very romantic movies and I would rather see an action movie, so I figured an Adam Sandler comedy would be a good change of pace and something we both would enjoy. <br /> <br />Click in my opinion is not a comedy, it has some moments where you might laugh, but in general it is much more of a family movie with a few innappriopate language. Adam Sandler does a good but not great job pulling off the tired and relentless worker who is trying to reach CEO by the time he is 40. He soon finds out that in order to do this he is going to have to put work first, which many Americans do. After speeding through most of life in order to reach his real goal of moving up the corporate ladder, he finds that life has passed him by, his father is dead, his wife has left him for a man who wears a speedo, and his son is following in his footsteps and ignoring his family. <br /> <br />Like I said I intented to rent a comedy, but what I got instead was a solid film, with a good message, and some funny parts to it, and not to mention the very beauitful Kate Beckinsale. So if you are looking for a good relaxing movie this is a great movie to select, but if you are looking for a good laugh, I would suggest The Waterboy, or Dirty Work or one of my all-time favorites Happy Gilmore.

B00005JNX0|2.0|Well what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn't what I'd expected. Those who'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right.<br /><br />The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care.<br /><br />Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story.<br /><br />The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch.<br /><br />The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear.<br /><br />For those of you planning to buy this DVD, stay away. It's a huge rip off. It's just something to keep you waiting for Shrek 3.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Neil Young is supposed to have a stash of unreleased songs and live performances.  This CD represents the first of what one hopes will be a large number of releases from his archives. <br /> <br />The CD is a bit short at six songs.  Surprisingly (to me at least) the best songs are the shorter ones - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Wonderin', and Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown, which I think is the best of the bunch.  The two longer songs, Down By the River and Cowgirl In the Sand, don't add much to the studio versions.  Winterlong is also nothing special. <br /> <br />Bottom line - if you are a Neil Young fan this is well worth having.  One looks forward to future releases (and Neil, if you would release Time Fades Away as a CD you would make a lot of people happy).
1400049628|5.0|The quintessential zombie survival guide, this amazing book packs in everything you need to know to survive the next zombie uprising. There are sections on which weapons will serve you well and which would be disastrous (despite your prior video game training, in a real life zombie uprising, chain saw = bad, crowbar = good). Other sections cover how to defend your home (fill your bathtub with water and destroy your staircase), how to travel as safely as possible through different terrains, how to organize with other survivors to fight back, and how to discern undead zombies from voodoo zombies. There is also an excellent, excellent historical treatment of known zombie uprisings from early history until now. Of particular note is how well the Roman legions dealt with zombie outbreaks through their disclipine, extensive small squad close-quarters combat training, and most especially their engineering prowess. Because let's face it, zombies can't climb, zombies can't jump, zombies can't run...so if you are disciplined, organized, and prepared you can survive class one through three uprisings as long as you don't panic. In a class 4 uprising make sure you have your antartic retreat well-stocked enough to prepare you and your off-spring to repopulate the world after the disease has run its course.<br /><br />This manual is laugh-out-loud funny but eerily accurate. Max Brooks has obviously done a lot of thinking about zombies, their physiology, their strengths and weaknesses, their true danger to individuals and society at different levels of outbreak, reliable and unreliable means of fighting zombies both on an individual and military level, and how to survive a global pandemic. This is an easy, compelling read which is tons of fun during the regrettably few hours it takes to race through it and I highly recommend it. The funny thing is though that days after the laughs are over you find yourself thinking about the lessons learned from the guide and how you might respond to a zombie uprising. Should I really stock my living quarters with the tools in the book? Where can I get that titanium crowbar? How can I be prepared during the spring when the zombies begin to thaw out? You also start planning special tactics against zombies...for example, a solid chain about thigh heighth could be incredibly effective against zombies....they can't step over it so they will simply trip headfirst into the pavement over it. Then, using my titanium crowbar, I can easily whack them in the head like that whack-the-mole game for the kids in the arcades. Thoughts like these will be coursing through your mind a long time after you finish laughing at the humor in the book.nd to a zombie uprising.

B000IFQLBE|3.0|Looking at the songlist for this double CD one is struck by how many outstanding songs John Fogerty has authored over the years.  Fogerty is one of a small number of artists whose songs are likely to live on.    Having said that, one can't help but be disappointed by this CD.  The musicianship is uniformly excellent, but there is no performance that clearly surpasses the studio versions of the songs contained here.  Further, there are no long jams (the longest song clocks in at 4:33), surprising given Fogerty's mastery of the long rock song.    The CD is pleasant enough, and if you like Fogerty you will likely like this CD.  However, there are several of his studio CDs as a solo artist or with CCR that I far prefer to this effort.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Bond is back and Craig has got him!<br /><br />Here at last is the long anticipated film version of \\"Casino Royale\\". Based on the very first Bond book this fast paced high-octane thriller is something we have not seen in a 007 film since \\"Goldfinger\\". This is a movie, movie and by that I mean it exemplifies the ingredients you need to make a great film.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" shines first in a very tight and brilliantly adult screenplay. This is by far the most interesting and complex of thrillers in a very long time. All the rather tired old comic strip aspects of previous Bond films have been swept away from outlandish plots to the old fashioned double entendre that used to pop on the screen like cartoon bubbles.<br />This Bond is witty but with a finer more modern approach. He is truly sophisticated but with some rough edges that catch and tear at the ear with both humor and intelligence.<br /><br />Fine direction by Martin Campbell pushes the action, the actors and ultimately the audience to new heights of action and romance. He shows us in the most jaw dropping way that to kill someone is not easy; it is a messy hard and dirty job. And you can get bloody in the process. Bravo for putting the grit back into Bond.<br /><br />Then there is the cast, a stunning array of international talent and indeed some of the finest actors around today shine and sparkle forever like diamonds in this film.<br />Eva Green as Vesper Lind is by far the best \\"Bond Girl\\" to date. She is an actress of great range and talent that brings Vesper to heart stopping life. Her talent combined with great writing and direction has amalgamated in this film to create what may be the only fully rounded and human \\"Bond Girl\\" ever seen.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen is astonishingly good as the villain Le Chiffre is a real delight to watch. This is no \\"Dr. Evil\\" but a cold desperate criminal who when cornered is liable to go nuts on you.<br /><br />Here Judi Dench is given her most complex \\"M\\" to date and carries if off with her very special gifts as an actress. She as always is a delight. And in this film you learn a few things about \\"M\\" that might surprise you.<br /><br />Then there is Daniel Craig who makes his debut as Bond. And boy's roll out the red carpet and put up the velvet ropes. This performance will bring him to the forefront of movie stars who are also exceptional actors. This is a man who can act, and yet never let you catch him at it. A talent that ranks with the top fine actors today such as Russell Crowe,<br />He inhabits this very rough and dangerous Bond at the birth of the character and gives us a hot, hard, thug who though the course of the film is transformed by human design and circumstance into \\"Bond, James Bond\\". He is simply breathtaking to watch.<br /><br />The film has a brain and also tips it's hat to great thrillers of the past especially \\"North By Northwest\\" as exemplified by the very sexy and delightful train scene where Bond and Vesper meet for the first time. But the most surprising aspect of \\"Casino Royale\\" is how human it is and how heartbreakingly romantic it can be amid the very dirty business of international espionage.<br /><br />this spcial two disc blue-ray edition is stunning to behold with a perfect picture and window shattering sound. The extras are simply grand as well.<br /><br />This movie at last brings magic back to the movies and heart to the Bond franchise.ts as an actress. She as always is a delight.

B000063DHK|5.0|THE BAND: Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Steve Harris (bass), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1985) Originally 12 tracks (approximately 71 minutes) on one disc when first released on Capital. This digitally remastered edition (2002) gives you two discs containing all 17 tracks that came on the original vinyl album (an additional 25+ minutes). Disc-2 also features 4 multimedia tracks for your PC. Included with the discs is a 26-page booklet containing many band pictures, song titles/credits, song lyrics, tour dates and cities along the 'The World Slavery Tour 84/85', music equipment used on the tour, the band's catalogue of albums, band history, a 1-page intro to the live recording itself from producer Martin Birch, and thank you's. Recorded at Long Beach Arena over 4 nights (March 14-17, 1984). Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs. Label (2002 edition) - Sanctuary Maiden.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Trade in your original \\"Live After Death\\" disc for the remastered 2-disc set. It's criminal that Capital was able to release this on disc back in the late 80's with only 12 of the 17 songs that were on the original vinyl record. I mean, can you imagine Casablanca releasing Kiss' \\"Alive!\\" minus the last 5 songs because they wanted to fit it all on one disc? Thankfully, Sanctuary Maiden gave this legendary recording the (digitally) remastered touch and full length treatment it deserves. Looking back over the decades, there's a handful of 'live' rock recordings that can rightfully sit at the top - Deep Purple's \\"Made In Japan\\", UFO's \\"Strangers In The Night\\", Peter Frampton's \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", Kiss' \\"Alive!\\", Rush's \\"All The World's A Stage\\"... and Iron Maiden's \\"Live After Death\\". Iron Maiden's gem here easily stands out as one of the best metal 'live' recordings of the 80's (all the 'live' albums mentioned here happen to be from the 70's with the exception of Iron Maiden's). I also think it's Maiden's best 'live' album (out of several to choose from - \\"A Real Live One\\", \\"A Real Dead One\\", \\"Live At Donnington\\", \\"Death On The Road\\", and \\"Rock In Rio\\")... and easily from their best tour. The classic songs are all here... \\"Aces High\\", \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", \\"The Trooper\\", \\"The Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"22 Acacia Ave\\", \\"Run To The Hills\\", and the lengthy \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\". Bruce Dickinson puts his own signature touch on the old Paul Di'anno songs (\\"Wrathchild\\", \\"Running Free\\", Phantom Of The Opera\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\")... while these are all good, Di'anno songs are still best sung by Di'Anno. This is a classic metal album by a British metal band in top form on their best tour (5 stars).eral to choose from - \\"A Real Live One\\", \\"A Real Dead One\\", \\"Live At Donnington\\", \\"Death On The Road\\", and \\"Rock In Rio\\")... and easily from their best tour.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|What could anyone honestly expect from The Bealtes other than perfection?  Of course, that's precisely what we get with \\"Love.\\"   <br /> <br />The band will never need validation as the best in recorded music history.  Nonetheless, this CD reworks the well known chart-topping hits just enough to make them pertinent and contemporary for today's listeners, meaning an entirely new generation is destined to discover these songs anew. <br /> <br />George Martin has done his usual superhuman exquisite job in the studio.  There's never been a more pristine recording.  If you've got a monster sound system, crank it up.  You'll really hear and appreciate the imaging of the instruments and unparalleled harmonies.   <br /> <br />Seamless meshing of multiple Beatles song samples into a single tune might be the most brilliant aspect of many notable accomplishments here.  Auditory senses are bombarded with the familar, presented in the most unexpected combinations.  The results are staggering.  The realization is that every period of The Beatles' career naturally segues with any other. <br /> <br />The generous catalogue of tunes herein is plenty to satisfy anyone.  Sure all of us would like a few other personal preferences included.  Yet I challenge anyone to say which of these should have been omitted.  What is more, try to pick your favorite amongst them -- impossible!  <br /> <br />I initially was concerned that having been to The Beatles Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas, my perception was heavily colored before listening.  But after playing this with three others who haven't seen the show, their reactions are equally powerful. <br /> <br />In summary, \\"All You Need Is Love.  Love Is All You Need\\" <br /> <br />The Beatles \\"Love\\" is a gift to restore your faith in music and rejuvente feelings that insist you sing aloud as the CD plays.
B000IZJZLM|1.0|The songs in this CD were sang by thousand other singers million times. Unless if it's done differently with new arrangements, new style, better performance it's a total waste. My suggestion, please find new songs, there are plenty out there. Give the new writers a chance, pay them few dollars and give them some royalties. And you IL DIVO, will sound more unique and different. After all you have great voices.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son has yet to sit through an entire movie at the theaters so I just waited until the DVD came out.  I did get him the Leapster Cars game so he already had an interest before he got the DVD.  I rented it first and kept it for a week (gotta love blockbuster's new policy).  He LOVED the movie and like kid's everywhere watched it over and over and over. There was disappointment when the DVD was returned but 2days later, TADA!!  Daddy comes home with an Amazon.com box with goodies for all. <br />The movie itself was amazing.  I love the age-old technique of putting thinly veiled adult themes that aren't offensive to kids (they just think it's funny) but appeal to adults.  Like the Bumper-eze (preparation-h) and the piss in piston cup via Mater. <br />The Ghost Light was OK but thankfully someone put some effort and gives some value to a DVD release! <br />DTS would have been nice but I've almost forgotten what that better than 5.1 encoding does to my 500W sub.... <br />One final bonus (some might beg to differ) is the endless range of toys/clothes/and other themed (even Kleenex!) goodies are out there for holiday shopping for your kids!  I've (ebayed) pj's, slippers, and a 16set of matchbox cars so far.  Plus Amazon sells books by the dozen. <br />5/5 Stars for me! <br />
078681859X|5.0|I love this book and have gone on to purchase the rest in the series.  I'm not going to give you my own synopsis, because you can read that from the author.  I will say I really enjoyed the characters in this book.  Bartimaeus is a very smart-alec and witty genie.  I found myself laughing at his comments and reactions to Nathaniel (the young magician apprentice that summons him). It had me laughing throughout and interested to see what happened next.  I found myself on the edge of my seat, eagerly waiting to see what would happen in the next chapter.  It's a great read for teens and adults.  If you are a fan of the Harry Potter and Inheritance Cycle, you will enjoy the Bartimaeus Trilogy.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I don't know wath was happening between all the involved in this product (of all the show, dvd and of course the record) if at Guy Laliberté y Daniel Gauthier (creators of Cirque du Soleil) or who, think to create this, but was a great result and succes.    Could I say all the praises and new features, arregments and orchestral works. Etc. but better I say.    If You or Them are purist or ortodox fan of the beatles, must be enjoy this work, and don't be so extrictly with this work, cause it was made with the permision with the creators of this Music, begining for Geroge Martin (Father Beatle) and all the rest partners Paul, Ringo, Yoko, olivia (the widows and ex wifes of) John & George of Course all the True fans don't get complaint, with this record.    Thanks All George, Giles, Paul, Ringo, the widows Yoko, Olivia,of course John & George Peace & Love Forever; The producers, administrative people and All and everyone involved in this proyect.    BUYING  LISTENING  ENJOY IT  LOVE IT.
B000JJRIO8|4.0|I've been a Pac fan since back in 91 and I consider myself a TRUE Pac fan cuz I don't buy any of his bootlegs or anything close to disrespecting Pac (*ahem* Loyal to the Game). Now I'm not going to argue about who Pac would've and wouldn't have worked with, because only he knows that. Those that go around saying he would've done this or that are just as bad as eminem and g-unit, cuz they puttin words in Pac's mouth just like those f*** did. Honestly who thought Snoop would work with Justin Timberlake, and all the other bogus collaborations we see today? Point is even though we don't see some of the homiez Pac usually worked with (Richie Rich, Spice 1, E-40, MC Breed, etc.)we do see new artists who probably have the same amount of respect for Pac as I, or any other Pac fan does. We accustomed to classic 2Pac or west coast gangsta rap for that matter, may not like the styles of the biggest names of the current rap game, but AT LEAST they don't do him like em and the g-unit f*** did. I know it may not sound good the way I say it, but the rap game is also a business, and by putting fresh new names, the album does much better than an album w/ artists (people other than Pac fans) don't know. It also introduces this new generation to a hip-hop genius, who they may have never known, unless the change was made. You can trust me on this cuz I sure as hell don't listen young jeezy, lil scrappy, chamillionaire, etc., who also make an appearance on this album. This isn't the best Pac album, and it's far from it, but anything that helps Pac's cause and keeps Pac fresh in the rap game, without dishonoring his name, is okay by me. If you LOVE PAC like me, or any true Pac fan, you'll cop one for yourself.
B000I5X80G|5.0|This is one excellent recording of Neil Young & Crazy Horse --my question is--Where are the recordings of Steve Miller and Miles Davis who were also on this show?  There has to be more to this set than just 6 songs-where are they?  Anyway--Danny Whitten's guitar playing is excellent and the way he matches Young on every solo is astonishing!!!!Jack Nitzche is also in the band--what a musician he is.  I hope there is more stuff like this to come out.  The voices and stereo separation are top notch for a performance over 30 yrs old. GET THIS ONE NOW!!!!!!
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Dark atmospheric telling of the tale. Very decent! It is a simply told ancient tale. The scenery is gorgeous. There's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time. It's a good movie, a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end.  <br /> <br />The movie conjures up thoughts of Gerard Butler as Aragorn, and Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson as Theodin in LOTR.
B000G759LW|2.0|I'm a really big Christina fan.  Hands down, she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there.  This album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics.  It would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role.  Although there are a couple of good tracks, the rest are filler.  I was really disappointed with the outcome of this album.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I've worked in the environmental field for over 18 years, and currently work on climate issues as part of my job duties.  So I went see Gore's film in the theater to support a good cause.  Little did I know that I would also be entertained--- which is a testiment to the production and direction of Guggenheim.  It's a real movie- way beyond a stiff documentary.  And the science in this film is rock solid- none of these facts are being debated; these are all well accepted, even by the Bush administration (see \\"Our Changing Planet\\" from the President's Budget for FY 2006 by the Climate Change Science program) who continues to refuse to take real action.      Some have criticized the film as being short on solutions.  Want solutions?  Ditch that fuel inefficient car, stop sending your hard earned cash to Iran, and reduce your CO2 emissions.  Replace your lightbulbs with compact fluorescents.  And press your State, Local and Federal government officials to offer financial incentives to use clean, renewable fuels.  But the film is not about solutions- it's even about more than just climare change.  It's about how we, as humans, deal with monumental, difficult challenges.  Plus it's a really interesting film with some incredible footage.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse is another masterpiece. I am wating for a long time, but it is worthy. It is beautiful, elegant, mysterious, soft, spiritual. You will never forget her particular voice.  <br />
B000GFLKF8|5.0|I simply adored this movie and I watched it over 7 times!!! I now own the DVD and various movie items. Clive was perfect for this role and he was born to be bad!!!! Not real sure about Jodie's part, was that necessary? Denzel is always fabulous! Well written and awesome story line. This is one of Clive's and Spike's BEST movies!!!!  <br />I work for a bank, and my subject line was because I would love for Clive to come visit me at work!!!!!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I purchased this set off Amazon and free shipping only took two days! I am very impressed with the unique packaging design. The small hardcover book has lots of questions answered regarding story lines and info on the characters. No episode guide though. I cant wait to watch this from start to finish and feel this is the best price. My only complaint is that the majority of the dvds excluding the bonus dvd had alot of surface marks and what seems to be fingerprints, probably from the packagers not wearing protective gloves and shoving the dvds into the cases. No skips so far though. I would like to exchange this set for another but am guessing the dvds in that set would be the same if they were not packaged carefully.
B00005JPCA|5.0|At first, I was unhappy with this new Bond, since I have always liked Sir Sean Connery as 007. He will forever be the original. But Daniel Craig pulled it off! I totally was on the egde of my seat during the entire movie! I loved every sarcastic line Bond arrogantly delivered. I wanted Clive Owen to be Bond but I am very happy with how Danny worked it all through. Everyone in the packed matinee theater was equally entertained and many faces looked very happy too. And every other time we have been to a matinee it was never packed!  <br />I can't wait to buy the DVD and possibly go see this movie again!!!!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Perhaps your opinion of \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" varies in inverse proportion to your opinion of the original. I was young when I bought \\"Let It Be\\" and I liked it, but I liked it because it was the Beatles. I never loved it, and I downright hated the way the record had been produced. It just didn't sound like the Beatles to me.<br /><br />This record sounds like the Beatles. A couple of the McCartney numbers are still kind of cloying; \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is still too sissified for my tastes, and \\"Get Back\\" was never one of my favorite McCartney tunes. (This was not his finest hour, IMHO.) But the title track -we get the old single version here- is better. The stripped-down and slowed-down \\"Across the Universe\\" is a vast improvement over the original album version. Harrison's stripped numbers are improvements as well. (I would argue that these remixes of Harrison's stuff paint a more favorable, and more accurate, picture of the quality of his songwriting than the original record did.) Finally, the inclusion of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is the biggest plus of all. It's a great, simple song that Lennon absolutely nails. Best song on the album IMHO, with \\"Across the Universe\\" a very close second.<br /><br />\\"Let It Be\\" will never be the Beatles' best album, but in this version you get a much clearer idea of what they were trying to do in that session. This record, or something like it, is what should have been put out originally, I think.
B000IMV4IW|4.0|Music: 5 Stars; Compilation: 2 Stars<br /><br />Oasis has come at the end of its contract with their label, and when told that a \\"best of\\" was going to be issued whether the Gallagher brothers liked it or not, Noel Gallagher took it upon himself to come up with the band first career-spanning compilation. At first it was going to include several new songs (including \\"Stop the Clocks\\"), but when all was said and done, we are left with this beautiful mess.<br /><br />\\"Stop the Clocks\\" (2 CDs, 18 tracks, 86 min.) brings a selective sampling of some of Oasis greatest hits and best known tracks, including its US breakthrough hit \\"Wonderwall\\", which still sounds as fresh today as when it came out more than a decade ago, but also \\"Champaign Supernova\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" and \\"Acquiesce\\", originally a B-side but it has become one of Oasis' best known and beloved songs. Nothing wrong with the music as such on this compilation. It's what is NOT on here that is the problem: Noel tries to rewrite history and conveniently ignores the \\"Be Here Now\\" album ENTIRELY, hence no \\"D'You Know What I Mean\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" or \\"All Around the World\\", all huge hits; other early-era classics MIA include \\"Shakermaker\\", \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Roll With It\\", and even latter day hits such as \\"The Hindu Times\\", \\"Little By Little\\" and \\"She Is Love\\" are conspicuously absent.<br /><br />I guess I could have understood Noe's approach if this was a single CD compilation, but it is not. Can someone explain to me why, at a mere 86 min. over 2 CDs, all those hits and classics are not on here? This compilation, however great the music on here, is nothing but a beautiful and incomprehesible mess. Lacking any new songs or any other twist, it is doubtful that this set will attract many fervent Oasis fan.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I find all of the people whining about this release quite amusing.  As the show is happening and a soundtrack would have happened no matter what, let's look at the two other options, shall we? <br /> <br />1) As mentioned in the promo interviews for the album, one option was a copy band being used to interpret The Beatles songs for the Cirque.  I can only imagine how this would have been received (\\"why couldn't they even use the real songs?...whaaa!\\"). <br /> <br />2) Cirque could have used straight versions of The Beatles' songs.  The reaction to this... (\\"I got tricked into buying these songs again... at least they could have done something to make them different...whaaaa!!!\\"). <br /> <br />Some people just need something to complain about. <br /> <br />I am a purist and have been a second generation Beatles fan for 30 years.  I think this collection is fresh, creative, unique and adds another dimension to the catalog.  Let's not forget this is a SOUNDTRACK - not a new Beatles album. <br /> <br />The only legitimate gripe I've heard is that \\"Love\\" has taken time away from remastering the original albums... but again, since this album HAD to be done, I'm very glad George Martin and son were tasked to do it. <br /> <br />One reviewer wrote this album was like painting a fake mustache on the Mona Lisa.  Although I'm sure this was meant as an insult, I couldn't agree more.  Marcell Duchamp did just that in 1919 and created a post-modern masterpiece.  \\"Love\\" is post-modern Beatles.  If you \\"get it\\", you'll love it.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Tom's takes on \\"Sea of Love\\" and \\"Young at Heart\\" are worth the price of admission alone.  When you add all the other great songs, such as \\"Bottom of the World,\\" \\"Rains on Me,\\" \\"Lucinda,\\" et all, you get the portrait of a human soul chained in purgatory but still hoping for love, calling up from the bottom of a deep, deep well.  I've always felt that Tom's voice has been underrated, and that his are usually the best versions of his songs.  Case in point: \\"Downtown Train,\\" (not from these CDs, but from RAIN DOGS). Tom's version is so much better than Rod Stewart's big hit cover version.  Anyway, amidst the clanking of wooden spoons on rusted pans and steel guitars fretted with rubber bands, you get on this 3 CD set the howl of someone with a great deal of soul in a great deal of pain who is singing his way out of or about it.  Listening to Tom, I always get the feeling that, for those of you who have read Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" what a set of songs sung by Jacob Marley would have sounded like.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Britain may not be as globally relevant as it used to be (and likes to think it still is) but one thing we excel at is creating icons and folk heroes. And Bond is both. Daniel Craig has done for Bond what Christian Bale did for Batman. Hoorah.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|<br />I just finished listening to it for the first time in the car on the way to work.  I was blown away by the how fresh and new the songs are and yet retain all of there original luster.  Amazing job done by the Martin father and son team.  Face it who else could take the most important and influential music of my generation and move it to another level. I was concerned from reading some of the reviews and articles that this may adulterate the music that provided me with 40 years of enjoyment.  Not so, BUY THIS CD!  Not just another repackaging of the same songs.  Should be a stocking stuffer for every baby boomer.
B000002U82|1.0|I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil...
B000GRUS22|5.0|As a devote Enigma fan, I cannot, in good conscience, critisize this CD. The real beauty of this CD is in it's simplicity. Organic is a word that comes to mind. I do agree that there is a lot of repetition here. But if you listen carefully, you'll find that each song stands on its own terms. Of course, I miss Ruth-Ann and Sandra, but Mr. Cretu has created a piece of music that is simply beautiful with or without lyrics.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|I love this album!  I first heard Sia with Zero 7 and loved her voice.  I bought her album, Colour the Small One.  I gotta admit, after the first casual listen I was unimpressed, but put it in my car and listened to it some more and I really enjoy it.  She has such a big, lovely voice and a lot of heart.  Some of her songs are a bit sad, but beautiful and so relaxing.  This is a wonderful wonderful Cd.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|This isn't something I'll pull out and listen to on a regular basis, but I must say that it was quite fun and very interesting to listen to the first time, and I'm sure it'll get played occasionally in the future. Unlike some of the reviewers here, I didn't have ANY expectations before buying it. I knew it could be uninspired and boring or it could be imaginative, fresh, and captivating. I must say I believe that most of the CD falls into the latter category. Some parts come off as brilliant, others uninspired. The first 5 songs were worth the money I spent. The rest is gravy.<br />The real news here is the sound; I hope this is a preview of what we can look forward to when the entire Beatles catalog is remastered, and this also gives support to the argument that every album should be remixed, faithfully duplicating the original. This disc demonstrates that the original multi-tracks were recorded exceptionally well, and the finished product benefits greatly from modern mixing.
B000002UUX|5.0|There's not much that hasn't been said about Megadeth's RUST IN PEACE album. It is generally agreed upon that this is a metal classic and one of the greatest heavy rock albums out there.  <br /> <br />GUITARS: Fast, heavy, agressive, complex riffs. The lead guitar's light-speed, melodic guitar solos reach labyrinth-like proportions [\\"Hangar 18\\", \\"Tornado of Souls\\" for example] and the whole sonic assault is backed by heavy, solid rhythm guitars [\\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Rust in Peace . . . Polaris\\"]. This is technical speed metal at its best. Most guitarists today still remain speechless at the way in which Dave Mustaine [lead/rhythm guitar, vocals]and Marty Friedman [lead guitar] master this level of complexity. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />DRUMS - Nick Menza[drums] at his best. Precise, varied, furious drumwork that provides the relentless guitars with the proper punch and rhythm. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />VOCALS/LYRICS- There's not much to say about Mustaine's voice: you either like it, or you hate it. The fact is that the frontman's voice is incredibly unique and instantly recognizable. His trademark \\"snarl\\" and growls are embedded in the minds of hundreds of Megadeth fans who instantly think of the \\"Holy Wars\\" music video when hearing them. <br />POSSIBLY the only weak point of the album, although I would beg to differ. <br /> <br />6/10 - 8/10 <br /> <br />The lyrics are, as always, meaningful. They are politically charged, critical of hypocritical politicians, war, and address society's problems in the same vein that PEACE SELLS . . . BUT WHO'S BUYING ? did. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />OVERALL SCORE: 9.5/10 <br /> <br />If you didn't have time to read the entire review, simply bear the following in mind:  <br /> <br />RUST IN PEACE is an 80s metal masterpiece, that boasts incredible instrumental skill and poignant political awareness. <br /> <br />A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS \\"METALHEAD\\"
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|Not as fast as immortal, but this really kicks.It's got a bathory like sound to it and that's just cool.This rocks, if you dig immortal then it's definately for ya,or if you just like good metal this is a great start, kind of like borknagar it's also a who's who of norwiegan(did I spell that right?) Metal.Good stuff worth every penny!!!
B00005JPCA|4.0|Okay, I have a confession to make: other than Die Another Day, I've never seen any of the James Bond movies. I just play the video games.  <br /> <br />(Yes, I know they don't count.)  <br /> <br />Seeing as I'm female, I've never had the need to live vicariously the ultimate male fantasy of girls and gadgets, nor have I ever fallen prey to the charm and wit of the super spy who seems to consider it a sin to have even one wisp of hair out of place.  <br /> <br />Well, that is until Daniel Craig walked onto the scene.  <br /> <br />I've always thought myself to be a Pierce Brosnan fan, ever since the ground-breaking FPS GoldenEye appeared on the N64. Even as subsequent installments in the 007 video game series faced critical damnation, save for the modest success of Everything or Nothing on last generation's consoles, I would always be the one willing to pay full price with each release. GoldenEye and The World is Not Enough (also on the N64) were my gateway games - the ones that truly introduced me to the world of \\"serious\\" gaming - and because Brosnan (or at least his likeness) stayed with the series for quite some time, he would always be the image of the immortal, ever debonair 007 in my mind. So when I heard that the new James Bond would be played by the aforementioned blonde-haired, blue-eyed bloke, I had to join in when everyone else asked, \\"Is this a joke?\\"  <br /> <br />But times change, and so must the face of fictional espionage. Although Brosnan had an admirable run, it was hard not to wonder if perhaps Bond's drink of choice was being served a little too dry these days. Thankfully, director Martin Campbell (The Legend of Zorro, GoldenEye) seems to have caught onto this and takes on the task of breathing new life into the series. Though risky, Campbell's work strives to completely reconstruct the 007 persona by not only introducing Craig as the new Bond but by implementing a whole new attitude, period.  <br /> <br />Want proof? Instead of the token \\"shaken, not stirred\\" line, when the bartender asks how Bond would like his martini prepared, he replies, \\"Do I look like I give a d---?\\" It's this kind of sheer bluntness that sharpens the film's overall wit, tossing out the campy one-liners and replacing them with a smarter, even darker sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Of course, 007 still has the usual undercover missions and bed conquests, but this time around, it's presented through a more realistic perspective. He sweats, he bleeds, and - gasp - even appears on-screen with hair disheveled. By no means has the agent gone soft; he expertly maintains his composure even in the most trying of situations. But what sets Casino Royale apart from the previous entries is that it dares to venture one step past the glamorous exterior, exposing underlying motivations fueled by passion, anger, even sorrow. Combined with Craig's gritty candor and baby blues that rival Sinatra's, the new James Bond suggests there may be more to his character than his trademark callousness; the end result reveals a more human and altogether more believable Bond - but without losing luster.  <br /> <br />People may watch films as a way to temporarily escape reality, but at the end of the day, all they want is someone with whom they can relate. Thanks to Casino Royale, its audience can finally experience a happy medium - the film is chock full of enough jaw-dropping stunts to astound any action movie-lover, but not so much as to sacrifice a character-driven narrative that people can sink their teeth into without a stale aftertaste.  <br /> <br />**Personal note: The only downside to Casino Royale is that it calls for extra discretion. Though it bears a PG-13 rating, don't be fooled; the violent content could have (and should have) easily pushed it to an R rating - this is indeed a darker side of James Bond. Viewers beware.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I won't burden you with gorey details, but must say this is a really different way to look at a nice collection of their music.  Every true fan must get a copy.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I'm not familiar with NoFX's earlier works, really... I only have their latest two albums (this and Wolves in Wolves' Clothing). I highly recommend both. I would say this album is superior to Wolves, but not by much! Both are spectacular. Angry, pessimistic, clever, fast, original... I love it. From what I've heard of their earlier stuff, this album is alot less... well, stupid, and more meaningful. Something happened to NoFX. Something changed them. They're no longer indifferent, they're pissed; and the result is amazing. It makes me hope political and social change doesn't come too quickly!... which I'm sure defeats the purpose of writing this and Wolves. Get both and enjoy them before the right-wing neo-conservative military-industrial complex is overtaken by the left-wing pseudo-communist egalitarian-society of the future.
B000I0QK74|4.0|If you want to know why James Taylor has had a successful career for forty years listen to this disc.  Taylor delivers warm folk and light jazz perfomances of a dozen holiday tunes. This one should please Taylor fans, folkies, and any one who enjoys holiday music.  Highly recommended.
B000001IPL|5.0|Hi. The Offspring have two stand-out albums, Ixnay on the Hombre and Smash. Of those two, of which both are amazing, Smash is slightly better. The only track I don't dig is Killboy Powerhead. Ixnay has one weak spot, too, that being Don't Pick It Up. If it didn't have lyrics, this song might be tolerable... but I can't stand it for some reason. So yeah. If you want to discover what the Offspring are really about, get this album (or Ixnay, or better yet, both!). Americana is a joke. Splinter is weak. Conspiracy of One is acceptable. Ignition and the self-titled first album are both good, too, but they can't compare with Smash and Ixnay. Both are timeless. Grab 'em and forget the pop-culture mockery from Americana which wears itself out quickly...
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Hyped? Yes. Great listening experience? Surprisingly, yes, it's all that. My first thoughts here - being more of a West Coast Surfer Dude musically - are these; Brian (and Melinda) Wilson, are you listening? A similar treatment to the work of the Beatles competing Capitol Tower inhabitants, The Beach Boys (current Mike Love legalities withstanding), would likely put this to shame - even tho' there is no Vegas show to base it on. Same approach could be taken - focus on the more accessible pop-based tunes, harmonies and melodies of the group's later (late 60's, 70's) work, just as the Martin project did here. Brian - embrace your legacy and surpass this with your superior genius! SMiLE II?
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Sir George Martin guided the Beatles in their most creative period over forty years ago. Now with his son as a driving force he has reminded everyone of the genius of the four boys from Liverpool. Providing a fresh perspective on the Beatles song book, Sir George and Giles offer remixed songs with expert remastering resulting in a masterpiece. The clarity of songs such as Drive My Car along with outake and original mixing of Strawberry Fields add up to a joyous trip for fans. Now let's hope the success of this effort leads to the long overdue remastering of the original Beatles albums.
6304779607|4.0|Sly, after having single-handedly defeated the Soviet Union in Rocky IV, is back as tough, no-nonsense but relatively ironic LA police officer Marion \\"Cobra\\" Cobretti.  Cobra is up against a gang of assassins known as the \\"New World\\", whose major activities are axe-clanging, riding motorbikes and killing random victims (apparently an equal opportunity gang, as there are asians and women among the victims).  The initial supermarket scene is memorable, as we learn that Cobra prefers to \\"put away psychos\\" (read: shoot multiple times) rather than dealing with them.  More importantly, as the gang sets its sights on hapless Nielsen (a fashion model), Cobra turns into a lean killing machine that despises sociological analysis of crime ie \\"tell it to the judge...we put them away and they let them out\\".   Compared to Cobra, even Bush could pass as rabidly left-wing.  In the end he is able to single handedly kill all gang members and even get the girl as a bonus.  Overall a low body count, compensated by an intense performance by Sly, some interesting weapons, memorable lines (see review title, plus Cobra's views on society and justice) and an unforgettable ending among California's orange orchards.  An interesting addition to a DVD collection, especially indicated for Sly connoisseurs.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|This is really just a one-listen curio dolled-up as \\"Beatles Lite: For Lovers\\", aimed squarley at The SoccerMom and DiaperDad set.  What Sir George needs to do NOW, however, is stop the AdultContempo naval-gazing (nothin' but lint, pal), and drop dem straight remasters of the Beatles Canon, poste-haste. Dig?
B000I5X81K|3.0|Josh Groban's new CD is good, but unfortunately it's not the level of classical quality that he had in \\"Closer\\" and \\"Josh Groban\\".  The song \\"Machine\\" is most definitely not classical, (it was extremely rocky, I didn't like it at all) \\"Weeping\\" contains the d-word, (major disappointment, because his previous albums were so clean.)  I did not at all care for Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  They really detracted from \\"Lullaby\\"s potential.  So, if you take those three songs off the CD, you have a pretty good album; although he could've gone a lot lighter on the drums and had more piano overtones like his other CD's.  That would have kept it more in the classical zone.  I hope his future CD's go back and stay in the beautiful classical zone that he established with \\"Closer\\" and \\"Josh Groban\\".
B000G759LW|5.0|This is Christina's best album by far! I like the way she made part of this album \\"retro\\"-going back to the 40's and 50's. She has the most talent of any singer I have ever heard and I'm 50 years old. She is an inspiration to young girls everywhere. I like her message-don't take crap from anyone and just be true to yourself.She devotes a song to her fans called, \\"Thank you\\" that's really nice. I just can't stop playing this! You go, Christina!
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This is the best Il Divo album and it is well worth 10 or even 20 bucks.  If you like Isabel and Si Tu Me Amas, this is one album that you must have.  Josh Gorban's Awake is good but Siempre is beyond great.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Although much of how I feel is stated in the topic, I will review the CD so as to explain my perspective. First off, I have over 1,000 Beatles tracks in my iPod so, I'd say it puts me into the \\"fan for life - purist\\" catagory of fandom. But what is pure? Is it take one? take two? take 2 & 7 combined to make take 26? For years we have listened to Strawberry Fields Forever and we have thought it was a take with overdubs until they said, yeah, that's it! It's a complete thought. Well, there is more than one version that we have heard. The single version, the Magical Mystery Tour version the mono and stereo versions etc... So, what would be the definitive version?  <br /> <br />When you hear bootlegs of their work you discover early takes which show one direction on a song...which was good...then you hear take two which is completely a new thought, then of course you hear the final version...perfect! Or is it? When people clamour (and I am one of those people) for the American Mixes on the American Albums from Capitol, you have to understand, we can hear a difference. So, even on vinyl and bad players back in the 60s and 70s with tiny speakers, we could hear a difference when they released them on CD. What's on CD is supposed to be the definitive versions of every track. But then, they released Anthology which not only makes new songs from Lennon demos, but it also allows us to hear alternative versions of songs we already had on CD as definitive. So, we know what's \\"right\\" and what's \\"not right\\". There isn't an issue of that. <br /> <br />So, just what makes Love a needed album in your collection? NOTHING! Don't buy it if you are just going to complain about what's pure and perfect. You obviously don't get it. It isn't going to replace their catalogue in my or anyone's collections. What it was meant to be was a souvenier of the soundtrack used for the show in Vegas. I am 100% positive if you went to see the show (and I have not yet) you'd walk away wondering why you couldn't have the music? Well, now you can! <br /> <br />It's a fun listen and it covers their career span with the sounds and textures of some of their most famous tracks. So instead of just hearing one song, you think of more than one song at a time which, to me is almost as experimental as using a Leslie Organ Speaker (which rotated) miced for someone's human voice to create the swirling effect heard on Lennon's voice for Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  <br /> <br />ON THIS ALBUM You will also find the vocals to stick out of the mix as well as a much richer bottom end.  You will be able to more clearly hear just what was recorded and not extraneous tape noises.  It's beautiful!  Interesting is hearing the lead vocalsit without cover by the others.  Interesting is hearing the harmonies without blending and cover of instrumentals.  Interesting is hearing how some of their natural rhythms blended with others from other songs which when you hear the guitars and vocals seem miles apart.  Interesting is Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows which combines two songs from completely different writers who express an idea about the meaning of life in different ways lyrically and musically, yet when combined, you almost wish this version was what was included on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band back in 1967.  It may just have been a big hit?  Interesting is how crisp the sounds are today and how much one might expect a remix/remaster to sound if we fans ever get our wish.   <br /> <br />Now I want the video of the Cirque Show from Vegas!  LOL <br /> <br />This album can never replace the whole collection and isn't meant to do so. Just as Live at the BBC isn't supposed to be the definitive \\"live\\" Beatles CD, or Anthology isn't supposed to collect every song they ever recorded, this is a CD whhich supplements their collection and maybe inspires people to listen to them in a new way. To hear the genius of the music in the simplicity of the harmonies (Because) or the intimacy of the performance (While My Guitar gently Weeps) or the complexity of the time period and recording experimentation they had brought to pop music (Strawberry Field Forever) is to hear the magic they created for 8 years in Studio 2 at Abbey Road. <br /> <br />One extra thought - I bought the DVD audio version as well and this gives you the opportunity to hear something even closer to the sound of the show in Vegas. They give you DTS, Dolby Digital and PCM to choose from. That's very nice! <br /> <br />Is this a must have? not at all. But if you don't have it, you are missing out on a new listening experience. It doesn't redefine the music, it just lets you hear things a bit differently. But in the end, it is a soundtrack album, not necessarily a straight listening experience. And without separation between tracks, it's really meant to be heard all in one sitting, like the show in Vegas would be if you went.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Maybe better than the original. I liked that they focused on Wonka's childhood throughout the film.  That was something that really added to the storyline.  They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too. I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original wasn't anywhere to be seen in this one, but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them.  A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.  Good call.  I don't know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.  I don't want to reveal what happens at the end, so let's just say that when the factory tour is over, and Charlie leaves, there's still a decent chunk of storyline left.   <br /> <br />I was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of \\"living in a world of chocolate\\" element wasn't really there, which is definitely a bad thing.  I mean, come on.  We ALL want a world of chocolate!  I just feel there should have been more chocolate-related things included in the film.   <br /> <br />Overall, it's probably not better than the original, but it's not worse either.   You really need to own both.
B000ILYYJE|3.0|THE ANTICIPATION FOR 5.1 MIXES OF ALL DOORS STUDIO ALBUMS HAD TO BE HIGH FOR FANS OF THE DOORS AND SURROUND ENTHUSIASTS.  AS IT TURNS OUT, MOST OF THE SURROUND EFFECT IS NEGLIGIBLE, PARTICULARLY ON THE FIRST TWO DOORS RELEASES ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH AUDIO GEOGRAPHY IS AVAILABLE FOR NAVIGATION (GUITAR,BASS, DRUM KIT).  THE LATER DISCS ADD SOME FULLER ORCHESTRATION, BUT NOTHING THAT REGULAR STEREO PLAYED THROUGH SOUND PROCESSING COULDN'T ENHANCE ON INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE.  A MAJOR GRIPE:  WHO STUFFS THE CD BOOKLETS INTO THE TRI-FOLD CARDBOARD DISC SLEEVES?  EACH OF MY BOOKLETS WAS CREASED, MANGLED, AND MAN-HANDLED.  I ASSUME THE PACKAGING WAS HANDLED BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE CHIMP CAGE AT THE COLUMBUS ZOO.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I couldnt have been happier when I read the reviews of all the people who were appauled by that god awful song being taken out. I bought it immediatly. Ever since this movie came out I have always skipped through that damn song....or it was the perfect opportunity to use the bathroom, smoke a cig, make popcorn, ect.. <br /> <br />    I love this movie and I always put it in when I'm baking christmas cookies. I'm not huge on widescreen...i actually prefer full screen. Annoying little black bars attract my attention. I must comend Disney on making this movie even better by removing a sentimental song from an otherwise funny movie. I'm not fond of romantic, tear jerkers...and that song was sappy as it could be. Now I can sit back and watch it without the remote in my hand waiting to fast forward.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Few filmmakers were able to convey the screen the bitterness and cynisicm the unsaid details that are part of the War. When the camera is a real and incisive eye around every little detail, then it can be expressed in all its extension the entire landscape around the war.<br /><br />Altman was always the enfant terrible, the outlaw of the fillmakers, following the steps of Billy Wilder (Stalag 17), Samuel Fuller (Crimsom kimono), Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory), Nicholas Ray ( Bitter victory) or Sam Peckinpah (Cross of iron), you may feel the dense irony that hovers and permeates all the script.<br /><br />Because besides the laughs, funny situations, this intelligent humor accompanied the spectator far beyond the show is over.<br /><br />Yesterday Altman left us, but his invaluable artistic bequeath is now part of the Cinema's story.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|This review is restricted to a technical flaw - I found the same problem (described previously) on disk 1 at 1:14 into the movie. The disk play froze and skipped forward about 10 minutes into the movie within about a 60 second period. I returned the entire set and received another in its place only to find the same issue at the same location on disk 1 again. Conclusion: there is a flaw in the recording process that the maufacturer needs to be made aware of.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|The Meatman is back and better than ever. The voice is strong the songs are vintage Meatloaf, however we could have done without \\"the butcher is king\\" and \\"monstro\\". <br /> <br />The best tunes on the album are \\"Alive\\" and \\"Seize the Night\\" (which borrows the musical beginning from \\"the Storm\\" on Jim Steinmans album from the early 80's. Desmond Child has done a great job coming up with songs very much in the style of Steinman and meatloaf and Child hopefully will do more together in the future. <br /> <br />All in all a great listen. <br /> <br />The Baron of Barclays
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Far be it from me to spill bug juice all over the \\"love\\" fest, but this just ain't a five star CD. It is a technological marvel, from the opening call of the angelic a cappella \\"Because\\" to the everlasting uplift of \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" you will be in thrall to the way Sir George and son Giles Martin have manipulated the original music into this sonic soundscape. Collaged parts intersect, collide and bounce off each other to an amazing cinematic effect. The sonic wow effect is a perfect ten.<br /><br />But there is something weird about this \\"Love\\" after repeated listenings. I kept thinking of the way The Clash sneered \\"phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust\\" on \\"London Calling,\\" and really wondered what John Lennon would have thought about all this. After all, the Beatles were notorious studio experimenters; would the multi track revolution and digital world of Pro-Tools inspired them to create something like this on their own? And would the young and feisty band of 1964 have leapt at the chance to glitz out their music for a Vegas show (despite George Harrison's becoming \\"firm friends\\" with the president of Cirque D'Soliel)? The warm narcotic buzz of nostalgia was the most overbearing emotion registered during the first few listens to \\"Love.\\" I spent a fair amount of latter listens amusing myself by playing \\"spot the segment\\" and catching the differences in the new recordings (like the string section on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" or the alternate vocal on \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\").<br /><br />Why I will probably return to \\"Love\\" during the holidays is that it does maintain the comfort zone of the familiar against the rearranged patterns of the new (or illusion of new). \\"Love\\" best functions as a soundtrack and reminder of brilliance...but it is not brilliant in and of itself. I am not a purist, so my rating does maintain the fourth star because it really does stand above the typical regurgitated re-issue. But frankly, hearing the clarity of the studio snippets serves greatly to whet my appetite for the inevitable DVD audio surround mixes of \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Sgt Pepper.\\"snippets serves greatly to whet my appetite for the inevitable DVD audio surround mixes of \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Sgt Pepper.\\"
0316857750|5.0|I found this book to be insightful in many ways. Although Robert talks mainly on Real Estate this book has helped me to open my eyes and look outside the box. I read this book 3 yrs ago, I make it priority to read it once a year. Since the the day I first opened the book I have started three companies, one of which I closed. But what I learn t from Robert is that it is alright to fail as long as you learn from it. I recommend every person who is struggling with self confidence to read this book.
B00004VXF2|2.0|I was actually one of the suckers who bought this on LP way back in the day. I was really upset that Lou thought so little of his fans that he would take such cynical advantage of them, and didn't own another Lou Reed album until the brilliant \\"Magic and Loss\\" and \\"New York\\" CD's decades later. It angered me that much.<br /><br />That said, this album did serve a useful purpose. I probably had the largest album collection of any student in my dorm while in college circa 1978 - 82, and people were constantly hanging out in my room to listen to music. When I really wanted to get everyone cleared out, \\"Metal Machine Music\\" was the record I plopped down on the turntable. It really is that annoying. The sound of two guitars set to eleven and then feeding back into each other for exactly one hour. The most audacious release ever by a mainstream artist, it landed in 99 cent bins (remember those?) within weeks, where I bought mine. Even then, I still felt like I'd been had.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype. This was Lou Reed's big joke on the public and especially on RCA. Claiming you dig it now and that it's an avant garde masterpiece only shows you to be still gullible after all these years. I give it two stars just based on the fact that Lou has managed to keep this con running into the CD age.
B0009PVZWI|1.0|This a typical case of damage pre-thinked. <br />The case is that the DVD-Audio side in this case, sounds worst than the Dolby Digital in 5.1. Much worst, very bad. <br />Why? because Sony wants to show us that this format (DVD-Audio) is not sooo good because is not under their license. <br />But I asked: why me, the customer who pay the bill can't enjoy the total supremacy of DVD-Audio format?. Just don't`play with us and beware us about your problems between lebels.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out, and immediatly became addicted to it. I know all the songs by heart. When I finnaly saw the show last February, I was mesmerized. It is my opinion that this musical should go down in history as one of best musicals of the 21st century.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|For nothing else, buy this just to hear the sound quality. The live version of I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND sounds like it was recorded in 2006. The bass is so great on some songs that I actually had to adjust my settings...same way with the drums. This is simply incredible. Oh yeah, we have heard all the songs, but not like this.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese is absolutely brilliant as Basil Fawlty.  There have been attempts at recapturing the humor Fawlty Towers produced, but they all grey in comparison.  This is a must see for any John Cleese fan, or for anyone with a slightly warped sense of humor.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is my first Akira Kurosawa movie. I'm a martial artist and naturally I'm attracted to Samurai stories. This movie, however, is not about the fights and the moves (although there are plenty of good fighting scenes). Seven Samurai examines all aspects of the qualities that make a Samurai a 'Samurai'.<br /><br />Cast is great. Toshiro Mifune is brilliant actor. He even reminds me of a person whom I used to train with at my last martial art school. He shares his 'rebel without a cause' attitude.<br /><br />The added features include a beefy documentary about Akira Kurosawa's journey and the Samurai film genre in Japan. Even though the movie is THREE HOURS LONG, it's perfect.<br /><br />To you: See it NOW.<br /><br />To Akira Kurosawa: Domo Arigato.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I just saw the Cirque du Soleil show earlier this month and it was mind-blowing.  Simply the best stage show I've ever seen.  The soundtrack was simply unbelieveable and every Beatles fan owes it to himself or herself to go to Las Vegas and see this show.<br /><br />I think the \\"Love\\" soundtrack is potentially the best Beatles album ever produced.  The re-mixes are extraordinary and I am particularly pleased to see George Harrison's songs get such prominence---the new recording of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and the mix of \\"Within You, Without You\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" were the highlights of the show.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I can only say that I feel that the best pieces on this album are the ones where they stretched things the furthest -- such as with Gnik Nus. But that's quibbling. I feel that the Martins have created something brilliant -- I didn't expect a Beatles show score to be something as personally powerful as I found this to be. This would be the case for me if only for the incredible beauty of the remastering here, but this goes much farther and renews the music for me.  <br /> <br />And I can only say that I really don't understand those who object to this on the basis that the previous recordings were \\"sacrosanct\\" in some way.  It just seems to me that they can't have any concept of who the Beatles were/are!?  I mean, experimentation was at the deepest core of their music, and much of their personal lives for many years.  Just who do these people perceive John, Paul, George and Ringo to be?  I think that the fact that Paul, Ringo, Olivia, and Yoko all agreed with this project and endorse the result (even all showing up at the Love premiere) says so much about just how representative of the Beatles that this concept (and it's execution) are of who the Beatles were.  I can't wait to see the show!
B000H7JD4K|4.0|While this isn't the masterpiece that 'Piece of Mind' definitely is, this is an incredible addition to a great collection of metal music from one of metal's best bands.  'Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg' has to be one of their best songs ever.   <br /> <br />Simply put:  If you are a fan of the band, you need their last 3 CD's including this one.  If you're wanting to start somewhere... I'd say anything from the early to mid eightes (with Bruce on vocals) will do.  I also have to note that 'bonus DVD's' are usually not a selling point for me, but this one was worth the watch.
B000JJRIO8|2.0|Why? Why? I have heard all of these songs already. I own the orgianals with out these other klownz on em'. Not to take away from any of these other rappers because most of them I listen to... But, WHY? WHY? are they on this album. If I want to here T.I. I will go buy his album. I dont want to hear him rap with Pac! WHY?
B000J103X4|4.0|The west coast is in full effect on this record! This album is a big f.u. to anyone who said he needed 50 or dre. While it isnt the classic that the documentary was, it does not disappoint. Game comes w/ that ol' fashion gansta funk on hard hitters like \\"compton\\", \\"one blood\\", and the snoop & xzibit callabo \\"california vacation\\". One track in particular that stood out to me was the bust rhymes assisted title track, in which game pours his heart out to his former mentor, and gives us a little insight on what went wrong between the 2. Overall i totally recommend this album, as a matter of fact, the only reason i subtracted a star was for the constant name dropping, and his almost stalker-like obsession with the good doctor.
B000006TG7|5.0|In 1977, AC/DC cranked it up to eleven and released their 4th album (in Australia), 'Let There Be Rock'. Very few hard rock albums before the late seventies had such a loud, raspy and metallic sound. The Young brothers created arguably their most amazing guitar reoord and it is still my favorite AC/DC disc and one of my alltime favorites period. Their earlier albums only hinted at the titanic volume and distortion of 'LTBR' and Angus played his most inspired and energetic leads. Every song is noteworthy and like 'TNT' many are not only AC/DC but also heavy metal classics. The title track is an amazing homage to the origins of rock and a tribute to men like Chuck Berry. The song simply oozes myth and riffology. \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" is in my opinion their greatest song (tied with \\"Highway to Hell\\") and as Bon says....she's got it all! Amazing rhythm section, fun, outrageous lyrics (about a real Tasmanian devil er...groupie supposedly!) and the most amazing lead guitar by Angus of course who rips off not one but two incredible lead breaks, including the one that closes the song in a maelstrom of metal anarchy! \\"Go Down\\" is an amazingly heavy blues that is aside from the volume and distortion a very pure blues, much better than \\"Ride On\\". Sex seethes through this record as Bon belts out his claims to sexual prowess (\\"Bad Boy Boogie\\", the original \\"moon\\" song), dealing with an S&M relationship (\\"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\\"), VD again (\\"Crabsody in Blue\\", let off the world wide release for \\"Problem Child\\", again a repeat!) and the pains of unrequited love (\\"Overdose\\", again with Angus on a roll come solo time!!!!). \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" champions the common man and the frustrated rocker. Every cut is a slegdehammer to the head and has an insane groove! I can not say enough about an album I have loved since the needle hit the groove many years ago. 'Highway to Hell' put them in the big leagues, 'Back in Black' made them superstars, but 'Let There Be Rock' created a legend in a raspy iconoclast frontman and a diminutive master of rock guitar. Long live Bon Scott and he and his band's greatest triumph. Again get the Aussie version for \\"Crabsody\\" but anyway, how or where, just get it!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|One of the greatest 'Flynn Flicks' of all time!!!  <br /> <br /> And it's Finally....on DVD! The DVD transfer is ok,not great,but just ok. The colors seem over saturated at times,and perfect in others, but who cares, the star of this film is...it's a hollywood master piece!!, that makes me relive my 'Robin Hood' days as a child in the back yard. There is a Walt Disney version also that has various titles and is a classic too starring the British actor Richard Todd called:\\"THE STORY of ROBIN HOOD\\". I could'nt fine it on DVD no where,except on VHS.But it is a very good typical Disney classic film too. <br /> <br /> There's a HD DVD version of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood also that I'm going to look at soon, but it doesn't matter,..........DVD,HD,VHS,B/W or Color it's the true classic adventure film for the whole family,......no sex,violence or bad language,just good clean movie making of the times. <br /> <br />Hey,where is my green tights?
B00005JP4U|5.0|You know, I was pretty much not a 'greenie'. Too many Chicken Little predictions of catastrophe and impending doom over my 50+ years (mostly by the press misquoting and sensationalizing scientific studies) that just did not happen, too much rabid environmentalism (eco-Nazis)that would prefer that we all return to the 'lifestyle' of say, the 7th century...and too much evidence that the Earth's automatic control systems were little-understood and vastly underrated by scientists ( recall the predictions that the Mt. St. Helens area would be 'dead' for a century or more- and its rebirth in less than 2 years). I did not believe that Global Warming was a defensible scientific platform (not enough cogent data)until three or four years ago. But having witnessed the eco-terrorism upswing perpetrated by the current administration, I have become green- not a radical but a moderate. But it is time that the moderates stand up with one rational voice and demand change.<br /><br />An Inconvenient Truth is a thoughtful, ethical, non-political statement about the science behind Global Warming- there is no screaming, shouting, name-calling radicalism- just the facts. Explained so that everyone can understand where we are and that there is no longer any debate. Explained by a man of passion and integrity around the subject. A wonderful change from those propoganda soundbytes the news gives us denying the now obvious error of our ways, and the consequences we are suffering now and will suffer in the very near future because of our errors.<br /><br />I still believe that the Earth will take care of itself in spite of human activity, the only question is whether we prefer the result to be with or without happy, healthy human inhabitants.<br /><br />Al, if you're reading this, I never thought I'd say it, but Thank You for this film and your tireless efforts.<br /><br />Everyone in America needs to see An Inconvenient Truth. And we all need to drag our  Congresspersons by their heels (or, if necessary, by their REPLACEMENTS) toward rationality and action on this issue. And we must also assume individual responsibility however we can- plant a tree (or 10,000), bicycle to work, buy energy-efficient appliances and vehicles- whatever we can do, just do it now.<br /><br />We can have an impact as individuals that adds up to a massive change as a nation, and an unbelievable change as a world. The technology is available, what we lack is will.<br /><br />PS- you may or may not agree with me, you may still doubt the science, but think of this- even if Global Warming is still highly overstated, wouldn't it be nice to cut back our oil-based economy so that we no longer support dictatorships, terrorists, and insane, greedy corporations like Exxon and BP with our oil dollars?NTS) toward rationality and action on this issue.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|A priest (Tom Wilkinson)is put on trial for contributing to the death of a girl named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). The prosecutor wants to hang the priest out to dry for the maximum sentence, but a promotion seeking defender (Laura Linney) is hired by the Church to defend him. She's a good lawyer but the Church wants his defense to be as low-key as she can make it to spare itself embarrassment. The state believes that the priest caused the death of Emily by denying her medical treatment and starving the girl to death. The priest denies these charges and instead claims that the girl died as a result of a botched exorcism that he was conducting to throw a demon out of her body! The film alternates between courtroom scenes set in the present and flashbacks to Emily's story.    This movie has some big shoes to fill, and you probably already know that I am referring to the original Exorcist from the 1970s, which inch for inch, is probably the most disturbing and terrifying movie ever made. So any other work that takes up the same subject is automatically at a disadvantage. The problem with this movie is that while Emily is the true subject of it, she receives very little characterization. You see her for like 40 seconds leaving her seemingly inbred community for college, and the next thing you know, she's seeing demons and getting assaulted Entity style in her dorm room. And why am I supposed to care about this girl? The writers made a big mistake by not giving her any depth. For all we know, she's always been a psycho, and the devil had nothing to do with it. Another problem with the movie is that it's just not that scary. I mean, really, would the Devil manifest itself on Earth to do cheap parlor tricks, appearing in a black hood, and make people do body contortions? I mean, doesn't he have better things to do? In the end, it seems as though this is a morality tale saying that bad things happen to good people simply \\"Because\\". The acting was great, especially withthe ever consitent Wilkinson, and Carpenter does a good job even though her entire range is either being psychotically depressed or psychotically possessed. Even though this version says \\"Unrated\\", there is nothing here that couldn't be shown on network television.
B000HWZ4A2|3.0|This is a very interesting movie and well worth seeing for its striking set design and King Vidor's stunning visual imagery and metaphors. This closes out a great decade of Warner Brother black and white classics and when that WB shield comes up and the Max Steiner score gets cranking, you know you're in for a fun, somewhat campy, ride. WB deserves alot of credit for even putting such a controversial book to film, but its somewhat undone by a talky script and overage and clueless Gary Cooper in the lead. I love the book and Rand in general, but the screenplay is too slavish to the book, leaving too much to speeches and not enough to action. Some of it is like watching an audio novel. Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey are terrific; Kent Smith is a little too weak as Keating and Ellsworth Toohey comes across as a completely one-dimensional caricature, almost an evil Nazi transplanted from a film five years older. However, on net I'd recommend it for it's look and the challenging ideas that it presents which you simply willnot find anywhere else - at least until the Atlas Shrugged movie finally sees daylight.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is by far the best album the Foo Fighters have ever released. I also consider it to be the best album of the new millenium and one of the best of all time. This is an album I will still be playing in 50 years time and telling my grandkids I was in the front row to see this band when they toured this record. The last 12 months have been awesome and its all thanks to this record. There are 20 songs on here, and depending what mood you're in, you can listen to 10 mellow ones or 10 in your face kick arse rock n' roll songs. From the opening screams of 'In your Honour' to the last acoustic note of 'Razor', this record is rock n' roll at its best. And with a bonus DVD, this is the best 20 bucks I ever spent.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Hey...I just got my box set today I received two copies of season 5 and no season 4!  It's totally weird.  So make sure you all check your sets!    I called Amazon and the lady is sending me a replacement.  She also made a note for the people sending it to check the set and make sure it's not also defective.  Hopefully, mine was a screw up and all of yours are okay! <br /> <br />Anyway, once I get season 4, this box set it going to be the best.  :)  Hopefully the next one I get is complete...
B000J6I0PM|4.0|What an amazing live experience. If the Cd was good, this is even better. While the CD is abbreviated, the DVD is shown in its entirety, which does the show so much justice. The tracks flow beautifully from one to the next and watching it I think the tracks are all perfectly chosen, however I still would have liked 'miracle' to have been included, I think it is not just one of their best acoustic tracks, but one of the Foo Fighters best. I actaully like the choice as 'razor' for the opening track after watching the DVD and the inclusion of 'cold day in the sun', but sadly Taylor stays behind the drum kit to sing it. The new track 'skin and bones' is really good also.<br /><br />The sound is excellent, you feel like you are actually there at the show, not just listening to it in you lounge room. It sounds brilliant with the 5:1 surround sound. Sadly there are no special features, it would have been nice to get some band interviews or a backstage pass or something like that, but the 5 minute intro is quite good.<br /><br />This is a really good intimate live experience with the band that all fans will love. There is lots of playfull banter between the band members on stage, you can just tell they had so much fun performing the show which makes it even more rewarding for the audience. Released just in time for christmas, I imagine this will be under quite a few trees this year.<br /><br />It is worth noting this DVD is now available from amazon.co.uk with a second disc featuring the bands Hyde Park show. It is 14 tracks featuring All My Life, One By One, Best Of You, Times Like These, Learn To Fly, Breakout, My Hero, Generator, Monkey Wrench and Everlong plus more. It is howerver region 2 and in the PAL colour format. But at approximately 20 dollars US it is a very good buy.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Why do we listen to the music we do? Sometimes I forget. But as several occasions have affirmed, all I have to do is put on 'Another Star' and I remember. This is why I listen to music. It is music like THIS that is why I listen. Because it is a soul connection.... a connection with the infinite.<br /><br />Such are the impressions of awe and beauty that the music of Stevie Wonder engenders. They transcend both time and space. This album, released in 1976, 30 years ago as I write this, affects me every bit as powerfully today as it ever did. Although Stevie's musical output has been quite prodigous, I think this was probaly his masterpiece. It is just such a total singular experience from start to finish. If one really listens, I don't know how they could not be profoundly moved.<br /><br />Originally packaged as two LP and a 2 song EP, the entire collection is a result of a 3 year recording session. The work reflects quality in both concept and execution. The musicians are awesome. (listen to 'Contusion'!) But like all his best work, it is Stevie Wonder's spirituality that brings this recording to life. And while all of the album is excellent, with tight R&B songs like 'I Wish', 'Sir Duke' and the melanchcoly 'Summer Soft', the album really kicks into high gear with 'side four' with 'Isn't She Lovely' through to 'Another Star'. This segway of five exquisite compositions, pardon the pun, simply knocks me off my feet!<br /><br />The infectious 'Isn't She Lovely' is irresistable in its happiness. A song he obviously wrote for his newborn daughter, it also coincided with the birth of my first son. The playful harmonica is a masterful improvisation of the instrument and is a perfect fit that really communicates the joy of the artist. It also runs for 'longer than radio length', as do many of the tunes here. Stevie obviously had earned the right with this album to do what he wants and he joyously indulges with lengthy treatments of these songs, but they are never too long. They just give him room to really express his extraordinary passion. \\"The latin-tinged 'Ngiculela' (I am singing) is a pure, beautiful piece both in lyric and melody. Stevie expresses his most passionate singing in this song: \\"I am singing... of tomorrow! - I am singing... of love. - I am singing... that someday love will rule throughout this world of ours. I am singing.... of love from the heart.\\" Expressed only as Stevie Wonder can say it.  \\"If it's Magic\\" is a shorter piece, but also beautiful,arranged with harps and a simple acapella vocal. Again, the lyrics carry beautiful poetry with, \\"It holds the key to every heart, throughout the Universe, it fills you up without a bite, and quenches every thirst.\\"<br /><br />Next are what I consider the two back-to-back most powerful recordings of probably the entire decade let along this album: 'As', and 'Another Star'. They go together seemlessly as a singular passionate statement, although each is quite different musically. 'As' starts out with a laid-back R&B verse, and then just gathers momentum as it morphs into a untraditional 'gospel' style piece with a call an answer section that is just too cool for words. What is awesome here are the lyrics. \\"Until the day that 8X8X8 is four - Until the day that is the day that are no more, etc.\\" This song really rocks and posesses a passion rarely captured on a studio recording. Stevie allows the tune to heat up until a point where he 'steps out' and has s few things to say:  \\"We all know that life's heartache and trouble can make you wish you were born in another time and place. But you can bet your life times that and twice it's double... that God knew exactly where He wanted you to be placed. So make sure when you say you're in the world but not of it.... you're not helping to make this a place sometimes called hell... Change your words into Truth and then change that Truth into Love and maybe our children's grandchildren and their great grandchildren will tell...\\"room to really express his extraordinary passion. \\"The latin-tinged 'Ngiculela' (I am singing) is a pure, beautiful piece both in lyric and melody.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Well, being that I've been a die hard Beatles fan since I was about 4 years old, and being a musician, I can tell you that this album is beautiful and wonderfully completed. The Martin's did a great job of mixing and creating this masterpiece. I have not yet seen the Cirque performance in Vegas, however, I can imagine what it would like it just listening to it. Some of the mixes that were done were just amazing, and I would have never guessed to put them together.  <br /> <br />Some people are upset because they consider the Beatles library \\"Canon\\" or whatever other nonsense they try to spit out. The fact is Paul McCartney has been twisting all of his music around for years in live performances and his albums (think Give My Regards to Broad Street). The surviving Beatles gave it their blessing as well as the widows of the other two, and rightfully so.  <br /> <br />For less than $10, it's well worth the price. I'd like to grab this in LP format just so I have it as a collectible. Enjoy.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|For once, here's a post-Beatles Beatles project that isn't a disappointment.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of elements from various Beatles songs with different Beatles songs works very well, for the most part (the vocal from \\"Octopus's garden\\" on top of the backing track from \\"Good night\\" sounds a bit forced), even when it means a song is truncated.<br /><br />The selection wisely favors the band's later recordings; I can't imagine \\"Roll over Beethoven\\" would have given much room for experimentation, anyway...<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent as well. You wouldn't know from listening that this album was assembled from recordings that are nearing forty years old.<br /><br />Unlike the Let It Be...Naked CD, Love is a disc you'll actually want to hear more than once or twice.<br /><br />Here are my negatives:<br />1. The CD is mastered at a much hotter level than the DVD - about 6 or 7 dB hotter, by my estimation. Seeing as how the overall level of the DVD is about where CDs were ten or twelve years ago, I'd say that the difference in levels is excessive. If you want to give your ears a break, you'll listen to the DVD, and relegate your CD to in-car play, where the hotter levels will help mask road noise somewhat (just don't turn up the volume too loud).<br /><br />2. It could just be my DVD player, but playback of the DVD mysteriously stops at the end of \\"Back in the USSR\\"; I have to skip to the next track to get playback to resume. (12/2/06 update: It is my DVD player; it plays just fine on another unit.)<br /><br />3. Contrary to what Amazon's listing says, I detect no difference in length or content between the CD and DVD. (12/2/06 update: I have since learned that \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Back in the USSR\\" are slightly longer on the DVD. That the difference was not immediately noticeable to me is further evidence of the fabulous job the Martins did in producing this album.)<br /><br />4. The packaging could have been better. The pocket for the booklet is a bit taller than the trays that hold the discs, so the whole thing fits into the slipcover rather awkwardly, making the whole thing look rather cheap.to the slipcover rather awkwardly, making the whole thing look rather cheap.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|The bottom line on the film is that is a very smart, tightly paced, action-packed police thriller with beautiful cinematography and great performances underscored by a compulsive tension that builds from frame 1 until the end of the movie. <br /> <br />The bottom line on the public is that because the film is so unconventional and densely plotted, it left many of our Nascar-lovin' brethren in the dust. Too bad. They're all lined up to take shots at a film which can only be described as \\"boring\\" by a viewer who simply couldn't follow the bread crumbs. <br /> <br />When the film was released I read hundreds of posts by moviegoers who had no clue what was going on in the film. To be completely honest, it took me two viewings to really understand how certain plot points worked together. But the movie moves so quickly that even when the heroes remove their ski masks to show us, the audience, that they are the perpetrators of a drug heist, there were still many on the internet asking who was responsible for the drug heist. <br /> <br />There is no excuse for that, other than simple viewers who were not paying attention. <br /> <br />Again, this is a great film for people who will appreciate the clever, intelligent way director Michael Mann constructs the whole. This is not a great film for people looking for ticking alligators, goofy sidekicks, wacky informants and a Jan Hammer beat. <br /> <br />This is a movie for grownups. The rest need not bother.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This is an absolutely phenominal collection of holiday treasures. The instrumentals, in particular, are mind blowing. These renditions take you right into the holiday spirit in 3 seconds flat. <br /> <br />I was always a fan of \\"Songs From the Wood\\" era Tull and wished they'd spent a bit more time exploring that avenue back in the late seventies. Well, I just never figured it would happen over 20 years later. This one is worth the wait. <br /> <br />This CD was released a few years back but still stands in the front of the line. Other rock xmas albums come and go but this one kicks all of their butts year after year after year!!!!!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|ill say this rite now...this is not like Fallen...except for Call Me When You're Sober, which is most like the songs u found on their previous album...other than that, all the songs have a different feel to them, and i think its great! variety is good, so stop dissing the album! its fine! <br /> <br />yea, we may miss ben moody and his style, but after u listen to the album a few times over, u begin to like some songs, and i think that this one actually shows off amys vocals more...she goes up way high in some songs, and u NEVER heard it in Fallen...like Sweet Sacrafice...or The Only One...its great! the only song where she went high on Fallen was Hello...and on here she goes even higher than that! excellent... <br /> <br />this has lots of piano in it, and if ur like me and love playing the music, u cant wait for the book to come out...its beautiful, esp the last song, Good Enough...i used to not like it, but after i heard it a couple times, i luved it b/c of the piano and its soft tone and mood...she kept the choir and strings (YESSSS!!!), and uses them in a handful of songs, making them that much better... <br /> <br />the songs on this album seem to have a more personal touch to them...Like You i believe is about her sister, b/c it talks about laying in the ground and living w/o someone, and in one part of the song, i think the word \\"sis\\" is used, and that would be a dead givaway...and im sure several others have meaning behind them, i just havent gotten around to interpreting them yet...but they dont just write crap to put on another album just to make some more money...like many ppl out there... <br /> <br />so get teh album, or borrow it if ur still not sure, and ull see for urself its worth the money u pay...if u dont think so, well, i tried...cya!
B000002UAU|5.0|How can you not give this 5 stars.  It changed the way music was made. So it doesn't have huge commercial hits, as an album it can't be beat.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Well, I waited on buying this one for a long time because Steve Perry wasn't doing the vocals but Steve Augeri does a great job.  Hey, he even looks like a young Steve Perry.  His vocals are great and after just a bit you forget that Steve Perry is not singing.  I have over 100 concert DVDs and this is in my top 5.  If you, like me, are hesitant about buying it because of the new lead singer give it a try you won't be disappointed.
B000002UAR|5.0|What a complete album for boys so young.  This is probably my favorite album. I'm only sleeping should be rereleased and should go straight to number 1 if there were only a god.
0634049011|5.0|This is a Big Message (Review) - Please read it - Its my honest opinion about the book...     I've been teaching myself Finger-style and Metal Guitar for the past 8 Months.       I have a habit of collecting a lot of Guitar Instructional Material (Books, DVDs etc) as my basic Aim is to become a Guitar Teacher. Out of all my books (and DVDs) this has been the best investment I've ever made for my Guitar playing ! I truly believe that this book deserves 10 Stars (or maybe more) :)     For the first time in my life I've thoroughly enjoyed a Instruction book(In terms of learning) and I feel I'm truly beginning to understand the Fretboard. I've completed almost 10 Chapters already and I must say I already feel like an achiever ! This book has cleared a lot of grey areas and has taught me all that I wanted to know - I'm sure that by the time I'll complete this book - I'll be a better player and I plan to start teaching as soon as I finish this book.     Also wanted to say that, as soon as I start teaching - the Only book I think, I'll ever recommend (or maybe buy) for my future-Students will be \\"Guitar Fretboard Workbook\\" by Barrett Tagliarino :) This is absolutely \\"No-Nonsense\\" pure Knowledge (and in a perfectly graded - in a gradually building manner)     Though I can play a lot of Guitar pieces and leads, (and I mostly figure things out by ear) - I have been having a desperate \\"Hunger\\" to understand the Guitar's Fretboard (which definitely is a Confusing maze !) - but this book made sense of everything and took me step-by-step, teaching me everything I needed to know so badly. I really cant wait to go deeper into the Book !     I truly dont know how much to stress - This is the Best Book ever written (IMHO) on \\"Understanding\\" the Guitar (I'm not saying playing the Guitar) - but I always believe - If one doesnt know Why and How things work on a Guitar - playing a song or a piece is just a \\"Temporary Pleasure\\" (IMHO) which fades very quickly...     I say all this from the heart, and according to my experience with this book only. I really-really want to thank Mr.Barrett Tagliarino for writing such a Master-Piece and Amazon.Com to have given me access to this wonderful material (as I'm in India).     Another very important thing is the way this book approaches the concepts - unlike other books and methods - it not only teaches or gives information about a particular topic, but it makes sure the student has got firmly fixed into his mind, by using the unique 3 step system of permanent memorization.     I must say the Author is a \\"Master-Teacher\\" and I envy (in healthy spirit) all students of him - who've had the 'Blessing' of to be able to learn from such a teacher. Though I've been self-taught, I take this book as my Teacher and I'm sure this will help me getting nearer to my Goals (becoming a good Guitarist and teacher)     I hope this helps you all.  Take care and Have a Good Day !  Regards and Care  Kush
B000002UAO|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  You can't not give them 5 stars.  Its like saying Mozart or Beethovens finest works are just above average but not excellent.  And yes they are the Motzart / Beethoven of the pop world.

B000JJRIO8|4.0|Almost 2 years since his last post-humous album, Afeni releases his 7th album since he died.  With 13 songs, 2 are remixes with different guests, you get some nice Pac material.  Of the 13 songs, 10 are redone with different guests (original guests were Outlawz, Dogg Pound, or Thug Life) and beats (originals were from Daz Dillinger, Johnny J and 1 by LS), so as usual since Afeni got a hold of his music, it got changed, which disappoints me some.  A good amount of the songs you've probably heard Pac's verses before if you're a true fan, and guests are on every song, and I never heard of about half a dozen ad I'd like to think Pac wouldn't work with half of them.  Of the 13 songs, 1 is a classic, 1 is almost a classic, 3 are ok and the rest are good songs.  The new production is from LT Hutton & Sha Money XL (each do 4 songs), Swizz BEatz, Edi amin, QD3, Orthodox & Ransum, and Salih Williams all do 1 song.  Still a must have for Pac fans.    #1 - 8.5 (f/ Krayzie Bone)  #2 - 8.5 (f/ T.I. & Ashanti)  #3 - 9 (f/ Hussein Fatal, Papoose & Carl THomas)  #4 - 6 (f/ Keyshia Cole -- slow song for the ladies)  #5 - 8 (f/ A3 & Jay RocK)  #6 - 9.5 (f/ Young Buck & Chamillionaire -- tight beat)  #7 - 7 (f/ Nipsey Hussel & Young Dre -- dirty song)  #8 - 8 (f/ Nutt-So, Kadafi (R.I.P.), LiL Scrappy, Stormy)  #9 - 10 (CLASSIC - f/ Kadafi (r.I.P.) -- great beat)  #10 - 8 (f/ Ludacris & Keon Bryce -- slower song for the ladies)  #11 - 8 (f/ Young Noble, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi (R.I.P.), Big Syke, Edi Amin, Stormy)  #12 - 8 (f/ Snoop Dogg, T.I., Chris Starr -- same song as #2 witha  Snoop verse)  #13 - 7.5 (f/ Gravy, Kadafi (R.I.P.), Hussein Fatal)    Tupac Amaru Shakur -- b. 6/16/71  d. 9/13/96 -- b.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Ever since my first time listening to BOOK of SECRETS five years ago, I've been mesmorized by Loreena's beautiful voice and her creative style for poetic classics like Lady of Shalott and The Highwayman. Now after an almost ten year pause, Loreena delivers her angelic vocal and music talent vibrantly in AN ANCIENT MUSE with everything I've come to expect and hope for.<br /><br />Listening to these pieces feels exactly as Loreena describes making them; like being on a journey through distant lands and ancient times. Among my favorites are CARAVANSERAI, THE ENGLISH LADYE AND THE KNIGHT (a brilliant recreation of Sir Walter Scott's poem of love and war through the Crusades), BENEATH A PHRYGIAN SKY, and NEVER-ENDING ROAD, a beautiful finishing piece that leaves you yearning for more as did DANTE'S PRAYER<br /><br />in BOOK OF SECRETS.<br /><br />Thanks again Loreena for sharing your beautiful talent with the world. I highly recommend this to anyone with an appreciation for great quality music.

B000007492|4.0|\\"The Very Best of Supertramp\\" is a 15 song compilation of Supertramp's hits and better known songs, from albums spanning 1974-1985. I'm a casual fan of Supertramp, pretty much. I never had any of their albums, but I've always kept an ear out for them on the radio. I'm pretty glad to have this. <br /> <br />I didn't know until I got this CD that Supertramp had two lead singers. There's the high voiced Roger Hodgson (who sings on tracks like \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Logical Song\\") and there's the lower voiced Rick Davies (who sings on tracks like \\"Bloody Well Right\\" and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\"). I tend to like Roger's songs more than Rick's, though there's a decent selection of both their songs here. They've got rather different personalities, but it all holds together. Supertramp's music is very keyboard driven, with a fair bit of piano and Wurlitzer, though there is some decent guitar work as well. \\"Give a Little Bit\\" is a beautiful acoustic ballad, for instance. There's also a couple of other surprises in the production department from time to time, (sound effects, synths, etc) which are always nice. <br /> <br />Worth getting for fans of classic rock, I reckon, and it has practically everything a casual fan could want on it. Four and a half stars.
B000002KCV|5.0|Comes a Time is arguably Young's most polished and commercially astute album. It combines the dark, anarchic artistry that sets him apart from his talented colleagues Crosby, Stills, and Nash with the songcraft and production skills they possess, skills that Young shares, but which he only chooses to demonstrate on occasion. An example of this combination from the album is \\"Look Out for My Love,\\" one of Young's finest compositions. Comes a Time appears almost effortless, but its value is highlighted when set beside his later \\"follow-ups\\" to Harvest, Old Ways and Harvest Moon, which, apart from significantly weaker songs and lyrics, appear forced in comparison. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000J10ERO|5.0|Brandon Routh is compared to Dean Cain, Christopher Reeve and Tom Cruise.  This kid has heart, potential and I don't have to worry about him being typecast as Superman. Brandon Routh sounds like Robert F. Kennedy. Brandon Routh was more like Spider-Man and Peter Parker than Clark Kent and Superman.  I would have think would have been like if he played Spider-Man instead of Tobey Maguire, I think he would've done it better.  In Superman Returns, he looks like more like a child than an adult, he looks like he was eighteen.  Just like when Dean Cain was playing Lois & Clark, he looks more like a child than an adult.  Brandon was playing Superman Returns, he was different like all the other Superman's who played, here he shows that he has problems, feelings and a nice nerdy guy image than I seen.  When I seen Lois and Clark had a kid in the end of Lois & Clark series finale, I keep what this kid would be.  Here's the answers in Superman Returns, the kid just turned out to be just fine.  Jason is kind of like Clark himself back then, that has problems, notting fitting it and feeling like his dad. Jason looks at Clark and Superman, they felt really close, and realize he's not the only one knows what's it like being a nerd. Jason likes Clark and Superman and become best pals.   In the movie, Jason whose Clark's biological son and Lois's mom is dating somebody else.  The next sequel, I think her fiancee Richard White is not going to take it really well that Jason is not his son and he's Clark's kid.  Brandon has a long way to go, if he was ever in Buffy, I think he would have played Xander Harris really well.  I always compare him to Xander Harris, Peter Parker, Jim Levenstien and Kevin Myers in American Pie that's how Brandon brings in Superman everyday when he's compared to these guys.  That's who he is, Clark Kent and Superman.

0618680004|4.0|Dawkins answers them all... all the dumb, lame, incorrect, irrelevant, deceitful and disingenuous \\"reasons\\" offered up for why we should be religious. Not a one is left standing at the end. Not the fatuous reasoning of \\"intelligent design\\", nor the humbug of religion's moral \\"superiority\\" over atheism, nor the just plain stupid claims of the infallibilty of holy books. On the positive side, the evolutionary biologist Dawkins is strongest in his own suit, and there has probably never been a more accessible explanation of why Darwinian evolution does NOT happen by chance, but happens, in fact, by the very antithesis of chance. <br /> <br />Perhaps the two most controversial arguments he drives home are a) how criminally abusive it is to threaten children with concepts like hell, guilt and torment (let alone persuade kids to blow themselves up!)  and b) how dehumanising and dangerous it is to encourage people to have \\"faith\\", and so believe things that are not reasonable. Here Dawkins really hits home. Expanding on Steven Weinberg's proposition that  \\"Religion is an insult to human dignity\\", he argues that religious faith is actually the \\"by-product of something else\\", namely, the Darwinian survival feedback loop of children unquestioningly obeying their parents. This faith in authority, when carried over into the adult realm, where rationality would be more propitious than obedience, is, in his view, responsible for very much evil in the world. <br /> <br />Although Dawkins can be funny, even hilarious at times, it seems impossible that anybody could read this book and not be convinced that the ideas it contains are far more honest, relevant and reasonable than any and all religious beliefs. But that's the problem with religion, those that are under its spell can never let the light of reason invade the dark recesses of the mind where doubt might lurk. Really, when you think about it, how Orwellian is it to state, as all major religions do, that faith is good whereasdoubt is bad? Good and bad for whom? <br /> <br />If you are already an atheist, you will undoubtedly enjoy this book. If you are not, but have doubts and need answers, then this is the book for you, and you are the person for whom it was written.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is an excellent romantic comedy.  However, it is much more than that.  It takes the psychological threads and complexities of relationship and weaves a wonderful tapestry that illuminates the human condition while it entertains.  I laughed many times during this movie and other times was nearly moved to tears.  It is an excellent movie to revisit at Christmas time and it is complex enough that it can stand up to repeated veiwing.  The acting and writing is also suberb and it has the flavor of a good foreign film blended with the best characteristics of a U.S. film.  At the price they are selling this film for, it's totally worth the risk to buy it if you haven't seen it.  It's heartwarming... engaging... and delightful in every way.  You won't be disappointed unless you are looking for very light entertainment with little substance (which there is a place for in my book as well).
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Fantastic.  Il Divo lovers will not be disappointed.  Album was well worth the wait. Great versions of \\"Nights In White Satin\\" and \\"Have You Ever Loved A Women\\". The bonus track of \\"Somewhere\\" was a great addition. <br />Wish album was longer.   <br /> <br />If you have never heard Il Divo, give them a try.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.     Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things.    Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying \\"insert spunkiness here\\".      While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem torecollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting.     Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This package is by far one of the best \\"Reissues\\" or anniversary packages ever. First the \\"album remaster\\" is just awesome--the sound was already great--just better now. Artwork--wow..Then you have the additional \\"B\\" side tracks, live tracks, and remixes. Almost 20 years on this still holds up. Truly one of the greatest Hard Rock albums of all time. Buy this and go back to a time when girls dressed up and we partied all nite long!!! Hats off to Leppard once again!!!
B000050X31|5.0|Everything about this performance is simply brilliant.  In general, nothing beats live music performances.  Having seen the opera live a few weeks ago, I can safely say this is at least as good as the live performance.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the greatest performers were the Queen of the Night, Tamino and the orchestra itself.  This DVD is truely a gem, and a joy to watch.  Highly recomended.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|I don't like to be that guy who gives a less-than-stellar review to a recording from an artist who hasn't released something in a while. Usually those sort of people are just the ones who aren't going to be satisfied no matter how great the new release.  <br /> <br />However I do feel this recording is a little on the weaker end of things. Even the packaging is sparse - it lacks that beautiful illuminated feel of her previous releases, with their myriad of artworks and deep, thought provoking liner notes. With this disc all we get is a simple cover that looks no better than a greeting card, and a small short booklet with lyrics and a few thoughts. It's so very utilitarian. I don't feel like I'm being taken away into a misty, romanticized ancient world. I feel very much here and now. Which is not what I want or expect from a Loreena McKennitt record. Compared to the packaging and presentation of The Visit or The Mask and Mirror, An Ancient Muse feels like an EP release. <br /> <br />The music is good. Not great. Just good. It's very standard Loreena, albeit with a few twists such as the use of a more electric guitars and rock drums. But in the end that only serves to give it a somewhat pop feel. It kills the misty, dreamy world of atmosphere that used to seperate Loreena's music from other artists. Now she just ends up sounding a bit too polished and mainstream. She's almost heading in a somewhat (dare I say it) \\"easy listening\\" direction. <br /> <br />I never support the idea of an artist having to stay with a certain formula. I deeply appreciation mutation and innovation. But I don't sense either on this record. It's just the same old stuff with a few new twists here and there. And it doesn't measure up. Maybe, hopefully, she won't make us wait more than a year or two for her next recording...and that one will present a more compelling example of her great talents. <br />
0446528056|4.0|John Tyree is a soldier first, a man second. Or so he thinks until he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis. While on leave, he falls desperately in love with Savannah, the proverbial girl of his dreams. Sweet, intelligent, and giving, John knows he'll always carry her torch.<br /><br />When September 11 changes the world, John is no exception. Moved by patriotic loyalty, he chooses to \\"re-up\\" in the army, adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to Savannah. More promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father.<br /><br />This is the story of how an ideal love can falter, despite its purity and strength. Not every romance results in a happy ending, but with a great deal of luck, those who don't survive will find meaning from the experience. Love, loyalty, friendship--all those sentiments are great, but to what cost? And how does this make a good man great? This is John's journey to that understanding.<br /><br />It goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of today's \\"master\\" storytellers. Part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists. Such is the case in DEAR JOHN. Sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components--well-crafted setting, high emotion, obstacles, resolution--then breaks it. It is from the sadness that hope emerges, and John Tyree, although still quite young, gains wisdom that will last a lifetime. Sorrow will be a large part of this, yes, but there is room for something more, something that will reach beyond the pages and touch John's tomorrow in a way only he will see.<br /><br />While this works, there is something lacking. It is one of those hard-to-define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding. Maybe it's the heavy reliance on John's soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors. Or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to John's relationship with his father, who appears to have Asperger's syndrome.<br /><br />I'm giving DEAR JOHN 4-Books for a beautiful story, but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper.<br /><br />Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer<br /><br />11/22/2006ther, who appears to have Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br />I'm giving DEAR JOHN 4-Books for a beautiful story, but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer <br />11/22/2006
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I won't get into how big a Beatles fan I am (there are a lot of us out there). I just want to say that it doesn't get any better than hearing the greatest music ever made in surround sound (played at MAXIMUM volume) for the first time. If you don't have surround sound, buy it just for this . . . it's worth it. <br /> <br />Highlights for me: Eleanor Rigby; Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing; Strawberry Fields; Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows; Here Comes the Sun/The Inner Light; and While My Guitar Gently Weeps (That's only 6 tracks). <br /> <br />It is overly tripped-out, but that's a very small criticism. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
1592289444|3.0|The story told in this book did not happen. In October the BBC <br />and an American researcher revealed that they have found records in the <br />former Soviet Union that conclusively prove that Slavomir Rawicz while <br />imprisoned in the Soviet Union did not escape. Rather he, like so many <br />other poles was released by the Soviets after the german invasion <br />and was sent directly to a refugee camp in Iran.  The documents that <br />prove this are written by and bear the signiture of Slavomir Rawicz. <br />While the book was the subject of debate for many years, the debate is <br />over. Its a work of fiction. <br /> <br />However, those who found the book inspiring should take heart in <br />understanding that even though this man did not walk from Siberia to <br />India, he still suffered terribly in the Gulag and he lived through a <br />painful experience that was no less heroic than the false story written <br />in the book. <br /> <br />It is also important to understand that some parts of the book are <br />probably true or have grains of truth in them. Rawicz was a polish <br />solider and he was arrested by the NKVD. He was in prison camps in <br />the soviet union. He did join the Free Polish Army after he left <br />the Soviet Union and he did serve in Palestine and Britain during <br />the war. Its even still possible that a \\"long walk\\" to India actually <br />happened but with others as yet unidentified taking part with this <br />book being a confused echo of real events. The world now knows that <br />Rawicz didn't make the long walk, but this still may not be the end <br />of the story. <br /> <br />Even though the book is strictly speaking not factually true, that <br />doesn't mean that is a bad story. As a story it can be inspirational <br />and it stands as a tribute of sorts to hundreds of thousands who <br />passed through the Gulag who lived amazing stories that will never <br />be told. <br />
B00005JPCA|5.0|I was really impressed with Daniel Craig in this movie. I think he did an even better job than Pierce Brosnan, though I liked Brosnan too. Nobody will ever play Bond like Sean Connery did but regardless Craig was AWESOME! True, Craig does not look like the other JB's however, once I saw the movie I totally understood why he was selected! I thought it was a wise choice to leave Craig a dusty blond and I especially liked his intense, ice-blue eyes...So hot! Craig has a very strong presence and is not only believable but edgy, raw and masculine. Much like Connery, Craig lacks the British 'stuffiness' which all the Bonds in between had. Craig really captured what James Bond would be like if he were real, he'd be tough and rugged and not some pretty boy (cough..Brosnan..cough) in a suit with cool gadgets. This movie was surprisingly low on gadgets but with the strong story and Craig's awesome acting, this was not a bad thing. I did miss Q but hey, you can't have it all! The action was awesome, the story was intense and kept my attention in spite of it being so long, Craig was sexy, the humor was dry and but definately there and I really liked the romance too. The Bond girls were great in this one, both are exotic and beautiful ladies. Some say the timeline was flawed and didn't explain gaps etc, but IT'S JAMES BOND and none of the privious movies were particulary realistic either. I found the new approach to this character to be original and refreshing yet it still honored the classic James Bond themes. It was both retro and modern at the same time. The 'chair' scene was BRUTAL, hence my quote above 'a little to your left'...You'll know what scene I mean when you see this movie and a tip for all the ladies: If you are watching the 'chair' scene with a guy, you might want to cover his eyes, OUCH! Overall, I really thought this movie was great and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!
068987474X|2.0|A male point of view: <br /> <br />The advice this book gives is not always applicable. If the other person in a relationship is not reciprocating, it's almost assumed (perhaps falsely) that the other person is NOT interested in US! Yes, most men do love the thrill of the chase...but we'll eventually, metaphorically, run out of breath. If a woman plays TOO hard to get, we'll give up. No matter how much we like a woman, we will cut our losses instead of wasting our time and money. As the saying goes, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. <br /> <br />And don't you think a guy who never gives up seems a little desperate? A little...loser-like? Personally, I will initially pursue a girl, ask her out and take her out. But if she does not show desire back...I say \\"F it\\" and move on. She may have in my mind been \\"the one\\", but she's no longer \\"the one\\" if she acts aloof.  <br /> <br />Good relationships are give and take. Ideally...50/50. We want girls who have something to bring to the table. The type of guy who never gives up is obsessive/controlling and has mental issues, as far as I'm concerned. Do you really want that guy? Can you really respect that guy...the guy who seemingly needs you to hold his hand for happiness?
B000ICL3KG|5.0|People choose to ignore why? People choose to pollute why? People choose to go on with there daily lives like there will always be a tomorrow for our children why? Well this movie tells all the consequences of the following questions in a very down to earth easy to understand manner. I remember myself being a small child in the 80's, now 31 i look back and wish winters were like they use to be, beautiful fall leaves(here in West Virginia) some of the prettiest anywhere would flourish again. Unfortunately that doesnt happen anymore. Instead my once beautiful state is now plaqued with overheated winters, deadflowered springs, painfully humid summers and rainy dryed up brown leave falls. Not to sound like a poet here or anything but this is really how i feel, i feel as though we have been raping, thrashing, and just down right murdering our mother earth. This is our home folks and if we don't have it we can't just up and move to another house or apartment building, let alone another planet. Al Gore has never been my particular favorite when it comes to political icons so to speak. I always took him for another Bill Clinton, but in seeing this film i can see he is quite noligeble about the issue and has basically devoted his life to the whole cause. Gore may be a sore loser, but hey what if you were running for the President of the U.S and lost, would you just gradually take defeat and never speak of it again, i think not. <br /> <br />    In this film we see a lot of great scientific proof that the earth is \\"heating up\\" literally. As a matter a fact you don't have to be a scientist, climatologist, or evironmentalist to see the weather has taken a crazy turn for the worse. Not to give to much away i literally gasped(as did my fiance') when we saw the statistics of Carbon Dioxide and the Thickening of the outer atmosphere that traps in radiation from the sun. That said we ourselves started to actually wonder about bringing children into a world where they may or more realistically may NOT have a future, and if so a very fierce unlivable one. So with this comes the question are we prepared for whats ahead, does the republican party really care? Does congress give a damn, or will they just sit back and watch as the earth self-destructs like a giant dissolving piece of paper in a scortching fire? My father who happens to be a coal miner heartely agrees with gore in that they should be shut down, as with vehicles, factories, deforestation, and even simple aerosol cans that can simple eat away at the environment. One quote from the film says skeptics say oh it won't happen in my lifetime or the planet is so big how could we possibly hurt in with anything we do. Well we are doing more than hurting, we are maming with the intent to kill, maliciously. And as for the lifetime, watch the film and see that its here, whether you want to believe it or not, lets change things folks please. I myself long to lay out in the grass once again, with birds chirping and greenish and flowers flourishing everywhere, but that dream is all but a thing of the past due to the majority or humans and there disregard for our home. Earth, remember the big blue pretty one?
B000IU3XTM|4.0|This is no \\"O,\\" but it is beautiful.  I've listened to the whole album multiple times, and while it lacks that tangible emotionality that defined \\"O,\\" it still has some gems such as \\"9 crimes,\\" \\"elephant,\\" \\"rootless tree,\\" and \\"accidental babies.\\"    Rice is at his best when the music is low and his voice carries the lament, loss, and pain.  We love when his vocals crescendo to the point of screaming.  Rice's voice should always be foregrounded, and the music should only become the center when he is not singing and when the music seeks to continue an emotion the Rice has begun expressing.  When he strays away from that tactic you get songs like \\"dogs,\\" \\"coconut skins,\\" and \\"grey room,\\" which are displaced and almost unlistenable.    We come to Rice expecting dramatics in his voice that very few singers are able to accomplish.  We don't need the veneered pop music beats and a voice that harmonizes and becomes part of the music.    I don't want Rice to make variations of \\"O\\" for all of his career, but he has the brilliance and ability to continue in this vein and flush out different styles only his voice is capable of.  If he makes more songs in the style of the three mistakes I listed above, then we've lost another beautiful singer to drab, formulaic music.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I was reluctant to watch \\"Almost Famous\\" because I figured it would be chock full of hype...but for some reason I decided to finally sit down and watch this story...and I'm glad I did.  I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.    I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...    \\"They don't even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts...\\"      Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly...     I liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies. Sure, some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of \\"Penny Lane.\\"     At any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome! It sure was fun to hear \\"Go All The Way\\" by the Raspberries as well as \\"Tiny Dancer\\" by Elton John. How could you not sing along to that 70s classic?    Now that I've been reading the reviews about the \\"bootleg\\" director's cut, I'm going to have to watch that one, too.
B000683VI4|5.0|I am a long time fan of the stars in this movie.  While many of my gender would call this a chick flick I do not.  I enjoyed it but was very sad about the way it ended.  But life on the screen and off aint fare.  If someone told you it was they lied.  I loved the dedication shown by Jim Garners character.  Even though I hated the ending I'm sure in a month  or so I'll pop the DVD back in and watch it again so I can get my fix of top rate actors and a movie with a plot instead of a big SFX budget. You got to see this move but make sure and have some kleenex handy.
B00062RCBW|5.0|Well, actually there are two and this is the better one. Took me two full seasons to catch on to Picard - but I get it now..
B0009I7NNA|5.0|These guys really know how to rock out, and I love it! I highly recommend this album.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is where you start a lifetime collection, add to it - or top it off.
1591396190|4.0|What a terrific cutting edge analysis of the future of business.  I appreciated not only the theoretical foundaiton for blue ocean theory but also the case examples such Yellow Tail.  This is a great book for people who can and want to think outside of the box.  I particularly valued the authors emphasis on product simplification in the context of unusual strategic partnerships.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|First, I won't go on about how great this 3-CD set is. There will be plenty of other fans here offering a conga-line of superlatives that I agree with wholeheartadely. All the tunes are great and much cheaper than paying a therapist. I think Tom is easly one of the top ten musical geniuses and performers of the last 50 years, and certainly one of the few left that hasn't sold out. You won't hear Tom's music in beer or car commercials. Orphans is a definite must-have. <br /> <br />However, for the completists out there, there are a few songs, most being collaborations with others, that didn't make Orphans, nor are they on the elusive (and illegal) factory-pressed Tales From The Underground five-disc series (a must have for all Rain Dogs, if you can find 'em). <br /> <br />So if you want Tom's other orphaned tunes that didn't make Orphans, the following tracks <br /> can be found on CDs here on Amazon (with perhaps the exception of the Hold On 4-Track bonus disc, which pops up on eBay once in awhile): <br /> <br />- I Know I've Been Changed (this is *not* the same version on Orphans; it's with John Hammond on his album Wicked Grin) <br />- Kitate (with Los Lobos on The Ride) <br />- Going Fetal (with Eels on Blinking Lights) <br />- Big Face Money (a short but fun Mule Variations-era tune that was paired with Buzz Fledderjon on the 'Hold On' bonus disc) <br />- Go Tell It On The Mountain (with The Blind Boys of Alabama on Go Tell It On The Mountain) <br />- I'll Tell You Why That Is (with Dan Hicks on Beatin' the Heat) <br />- Saw Sage (with C-Side, on the Coffee and Cigarettes soundtrack) <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />P.S. Tom, if you read this, remember you still owe me twenty bucks for gas. <br />
B000002UA5|2.0|<br />...and probably for die-hard Floyd fans only. The live album features extended, more intense versions of studio songs, and captures what was basically the Floyd's live set before Dark Side of the Moon. It's both an interesting historical record of that time in rock (with the emphasis on extended jams and atmospherics) and you can also see in the live disc, much more so than the studio disc, the influence that the Floyd have to this day. Speaking of which, the studio disc is basically a pile of hippie arse, the only redeeming track being Waters' \\"Grantchester Meadows\\", a soft acoustic song that perfectly conjures up the hazy 3-d impression of being out in nature.  <br /> <br />If you read the band member's comments on this album now, they are pretty scathing. Gilmour says he 'bs'd his way through the narrow way', and Waters (I think) has said that with this and the next album they were basically floundering around in the dark. As we all know, the results of that floundering paid off handsomely, and this is an interesting signpost in the Floyd's development, but doesn't really have much merit on it's own.
1843104954|5.0|I am eager to learn what people think of my new book, and in reply to the previous review, I have no problem with you copying that chpater for the teacher <br /> <br />Tony Attwood
B00008CLOA|5.0|I agree with a previous review that the standard red book CD section of this Hybrid SACD is somewhat lacking. If you do not own an SACD player I can't think of a reason to buy it. Other versions are much better. <br /> <br />However, I cannot rate the 5.1 SACD section highly enough. For those of you who have not heard an SACD. I can only tell you that SACD 5.1 surround is to stereo as stereo is to mono and it's recorded at a whopping 64 times the resolution of a regular CD. The SACD section of a hybrid SACD is actually a DVD-5 (4.7GB) to hold all that audio data. That's why a regular CD player can't play it. It's an entirely new listening experience. <br /> <br />Most importantly this 5.1 surround mix is the one officially authorized by Pink Floyd themselves. The previously released (quadrophonic version) was mixed by Alan Parsons. While it was a good mix the band did not care for it and did not want it released as their product. This SACD release is the interpretation that Pink Floyd wanted. So if you want to hear Dark Side of the Moon in super high fidelity, in magical 5.1 surround, the way the band themselves visualized it, I can't think of a reason NOT to buy it.
B00000DCH9|3.0|i don't know, i've had this and the majority of his albums on cassette recorded from vinyl for the longest time, and listening to them recently caused me to get the CD versions to kind of upgrade, but to be honest, it does not sound the same. \\" cold spring harbour\\" screwed up as it is still sounds better on vinyl to me. and to be honest i just listened to piano man on CD hours ago and i can't help but feel that all the other instruments have been relegated to the background by the mixer. where before each instrument in \\"a travelin' prayer\\" had its own part, similar to a bluegrass band, on this CD version they've all beenmixed into the background where you hear piano and vocals predominantly.  i'm sorry but i don't feel that that is what mr. joel was trying to accomplish by this recording. i would love to see for once, someone take an older album and lovingly reproduce, not just the music itself, but the original intent of an artist onto CD so that we not lose the history of some of these recordings which made us love the artists in the first place!!!
B000HIVQK8|5.0|Lost amongst all the hubbub about the Beatles new, albeit spectacular \\"Love\\" release is the fact George Harrison's remastered, expanded \\"Living in the Material World\\" is in the stores. <br />Relatively few print reviews have appeared since the late September release, somewhat confusing and very disappointing. Some reviewers obviously will never give Harrison credit; in 'Q' magazine, the writer said this album was one without any classics. What about the worldwide smash hit \\"Give Me Love\\"? It sounds fresh, musical and poignant 33 years later! <br />But that's just the first of 13 songs that range from OK (\\"Try Some, Buy Some\\") to absolutely stunning (the bouncy single-that-never-was \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,\\" rollicking title track and the meditative \\"Be Here Now.\\")  <br />Simply put, \\"Material World\\" is a long-neglected musical gem with brilliant Harrison guitar work throughout (bottleneck slide, acoustic, dobro, you name it) along with the solid underpinning of drummer Jim Keltner and bass player Klaus Voorman. Add to that punch horns from -- who else -- Jim Horn and tasty piano by Nicky Hopkins, especially on the magical \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World.\\" <br />Harrison also never played better slide guitar than on the Side 2 opener (remember vinyl?) \\"The Lord Loves The One (That Loves The Lord.\\" Yes, lyrics here and throughout can be viewed as overly preachy, even accusatory toward mortals in the material world. But George is painfully honest in his views, and only wanted to share his spiritual bounty with others. He probably went over the top a bit, but if you can not get caught up in that, you will soak in nothing but sublime pop-rock music at its early-1970s best. <br />Extras are here as well, such as the spare but excellent B-side \\"Deep Blue,\\" and playful \\"Miss O'Dell,\\" both never before officially issued. The accompanying DVD is too short, continuing a problem found with previous Harrison releases (\\"Brainwashed\\" special edition). But the video of \\"Give Me Love\\" from the Harrison-Clapton tour of Japan in December 1991 begs the question \\"when will the whole thing come out on DVD?\\" Other features on the DVD are fun (alternate version of \\"Miss O'Dell\\" set to a photo montage) and interesting (a short film showing the original albums being pressed). <br />There also is a great booklet with rare photos, lyrics big enough for Boomers like me to read and a two-page spread showing pics of various music trade charts (Billboard, etc.) reminding that both \\"Material World\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\" were chart toppers on both sides of the Atlantic. <br />When this album came out in June 1973, high school friends and I gathered around a turntable for a listening party. We loved it, but it was a bit of a letdown since NOTHING could ever equal or top \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" Still, it was on our turntables and in our car 8-Track players all summer. Now, as 2007 beckons, hopefully old George fans will come back to this album by way of this reissue -- and a new generation of fans will sample the Quiet Beatle's most-intimate work and give it the thumbs up it richly deserves. Forget those lazy critics who think it's only a John and Paul world. Give George Harrison and his underappreciated work a new chance!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I heard about the Vegas show \\"Love\\" - and knew that George Martin and his son did some remastering of various Beatles  songs, but did not expect much. As a fan I had to purchase this...and am I impressed.  The songs, remasterings, added bits,  etc. make this an awesome listen.<br /><br />  In short this sort of polishes off The Beatles and presents them at their best...a must for any fan (or fan to be).
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw this Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas over the summer, and I was totally blown away not only by Cirque's astonishing and beautiful tribute to the Beatles, but also by the soundtrack. I've had these songs memorized since childhood, and I was a bit worried about how they would be presented in the Cirque show, but I shouldn't have doubted the talents of either Cirque or the Martins.  From the opening a capella version of Because, I was transfixed by the music -- familiar and different at the same time, and amazingly clear and beautiful.  The vocals and instrumentation were so clear, and some of the reinvented tracks were so gorgeous, I actually had tears of joy in my eyes a couple of times during the performance. My only complaint at the time was that the soundtrack wasn't available for sale after the show!    Well, now the soundtrack is finally here, and it's as beautiful, sumptuous, and clear as I remember. No, it doesn't take the place of the Beatles' original recordings -- heavens, no -- but as a nonstop montage of the sheer artistry and talent of the Beatles AND of the Martins, it can't be beat.  Highly recommended!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Some won't like this disc, but I can't imagine a true Beatles fan not finding something in it that makes it worth buying.  I just finished listening to it for the first time, and it was like being a kid again and hearing a new Beatles album for the first time.  I haven't experienced that in 30 years.  In my opinion, this disc is worth the money just to hear Because and While My Guitar Gently Weeps - both of these tracks are absolutely beautiful. The remixes of the others are well done.  Some of the remixes are really clever, for example, Strawberry Fields, Drive My Car/The Word, and Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows.    What stands out to me is the vocals.  It seems the Martins de-emphasized and/or stripped away a lot of the instrument tracks and made the vocal tracks more prominent.  As a result, you hear these vocal tracks like you've never heard them before, because they were buried in the instrumentation.  Their vocals are better than I ever knew.    I was so skeptical of this disc before I heard it.  But after listening to it once, I am delighted with it, and I highly recommend it.
B000J103PC|3.0|The title of the film (based on the bestselling novel which I have not read) refers to a New York fashion magazine editor named Miranda Priestly. This devil, I mean, Miranda, is played by Meryl Streep who is in top form, bringing the film itself one or two notches above other Hollywood comedies. Whether or not you like her dragon-lady character, you will be impresses with her turn, one of her best in a decade. or maybe two. <br /> <br />I must add that Anne Hathaway is also very good as Andy, a naïve career girl in New York who scored a job as the second assistant to Miranda. For Andy it as only a stepping stone to be a journalist, but while doing the thankless jobs for Miranda, she is gradually attracted to the world which she initially despised.  <br /> <br />Miranda never misses a chance to reveal her (perversely) cynical view on everything which she dislikes, and the way she makes her acid comments on them has a certain kind of unforgettable taste that is either repulsive or irresistible, or both. The sado-masochistic relations between her and Andy keeps you interested in the film's otherwise predictable story, even though anyone with level-headed mind (like Andy) would not usually turn down the opportunity to learn at a first-rate law school in order to be ill-treated by Miranda. As Stanley Tucci's fashion director says, why not quit? <br /> <br />In spite of superb acting from Streep and Hathaway, and the critical praises heaped on the film, I find `The Devil Wears Prada' left much to be desired. The script is almost auto-pilot when the main characters do not share the screen. In fact the career success of Andy (if I may call her `success' that way) owes much to incredible luck; she is lucky to have a capable fashion director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) at hand when she wants it, and an entire wardrobe for them to use for that matter; she is lucky to know a writer working for another prestigious New York magazine Christian (Simon Baker) who can help her out when Miranda asks Andy to obtain something very rare (actually, no one but J. K. Rowling can). There is something cosy and (if I may so) superficial about the film's attitudes to the works Andy is trying to do, something that prevents the film from becoming a really biting comedy that it could have been. <br /> <br />There is one impressive scene showing why Meryl Streep is a great actress who is not afraid of being truly in character. I do not say when and how she shows it because it is the only surprise I got while watching `The Devil Wears Prada.' The film is enjoyable with the great performances of the two leads, the beautiful locations of the city and the fashionable costumes, but it could still have been better with just something more than another take of success story, and some more scenes looking under the surface of the people working for this fashion industry.
B00006L3S3|1.0|This is probably my favourite Lennon album, the only rival being POB. It is a terrible shame that John's legacy seems to be in the hands of people who do not understand, value or respect his work. Everything else aside, WHY HAVE THE LAST FEW SECONDS OF THE ALBUM BEEN CUT? Do you think you know better than John Lennon who chose to release Meat City with its spoken tag?
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My mother showed this movie to our children and we were so surprised at their response.  They love it!  The title song to this delightful musical has been memorized and sung over and over by the sweetest little voices!  It is movies like this one, with old fashioned family values, that should be shown in our homes.  There is no doubt in my mind that the world was a more pleasant place back then...and I want to share that with my family.  A fun, colorful, delightful film with glorious music for the whole family.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Anyone and everyone who loves or even remotely likes the Beatles (and, really, shouldn't that be just about anyone who enjoys rock?) should purchase this special edition with the DVD.  Not only is the music itself incredible, not only is the remastering job on the CD amazing, but the DVD in surround is absolutely mind-blowing.  You cannot believe how huge and clear the sound is in surround.  Fantastic!  What Goerge M. and son have accomplished here is a work of art, pure and simple. Finally, one last comment - in remastered sound, it is astounding how fresh and new these recordings sound.  The music is beyond timeless - most, if not all of it sounds as though it was literally recorded a few hours ago.  They are, and always will be, the best band ever.
0790749815|4.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" (1959) is an extremely entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. Truth to be told, you will never know, because surprises abound in this Hitchcock movie with a plot based on a \\"wrong man scenario\\".<br /><br />Do you want to know more? Well, the main character is Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive that is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy that supposedly works for the USA government. The problem is that he is wrongly identified by foreign spies working in America, who are extremely eager to kill him and not particularly predisposed to believe that he is, in fact, Roger O. Thornhill. That is the reason why Roger faces two choices: to run or to be killed. Needless to say, he embraces the first choice, running for his life whilst attempting to learn more about the real Mr. Kaplan. Roger will get unexpected help from a beautiful and mysterious woman, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). But is she with or against him?. And where on earth is George Kaplan?<br /><br />The answers to those questions are likely to keep the spectator enthralled. Of course, the fact that \\"North by Northwest\\"  has a great director, an outstanding cast, excellent musical score (Bernard Herrmann) and a fluid script (Ernest Lehman) doesn't hurt, either  :)  All in all, highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000JBWWBK|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack immediately after seeing the film. I am thoroughly enjoying this delightful variety of songs AND I do not even speak French!
0345457684|3.0|So much going for it, and such a cool premise. To me, and this is entirely personal, it needed more editing. The third act went too long, and I lost interest. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to Morgan's other works. Hopefully, this was an isolated issue.
B000H1QYXY|4.0|George  Michael celebrates 25 years in the industry with the release of greatest hits compilation \\"Twenty Five\\", a two or three-CD package that takes in everything from Wham! hits to the \\"Faith \\" era and his most recent material (depending on how long you want to spend with him). <br /> <br />No matter what you might think of him in terms of his media depiction, George Michael remains one of the most successful and prolific artists of our generation, and an iconic music industry figure since the 1980s. <br /> <br />He has been a solo star for over 20 years, during which time he has achieved international success and sold over 85 million albums worldwide. There have also been six US No.1 singles, 11 British No.1s and the title of \\"most played artist on British radio\\" in the past 20 years. <br /> <br />Of the two formats of \\"Twenty Five\\", the 3CD version is arguably the most rewarding, given that the third CD features some rarer tracks, the occasional cover and a solid version of \\"Brother Can You Spare A Dime?\\"  that was recorded as part of Pavarotti and friends. It's mostly for the die-hard fans but succeeds in showcasing a side to George Michael that isn't always featured on the radio. <br /> <br />The remaining two CDs are packed with some fairly obvious choices - the best of which pick themselves. For the shamelessly nostalgic, there's the cheesy Wham! hits \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\", which has to be filed under 'so bad, it's fun' and the equally shameless \\"Freedom\\"  (which those of a certain generation will probably remember singing or bopping along to). <br /> <br />\\"Last Christmas\\" and \\"Careless Whispe\\"r also feature (as they do at countless wedding ceremonies). <br /> <br />Early solo material such as the breezy pop classic \\"Faith\\" still sound fresh today and retain a timeless quality. \\"Faith\\",  in particular, is arguably one of George Michael's finest creations and is similar in feel-good value to U2's \\"Desire\\" or OutKast's more recent \\"Hey Ya\\" - ie, no matter how many times you hear it, you'll still feel like dancing. <br /> <br />The deeper and more sombre style of George Michael is best exemplified in heartfelt songs such as \\"Father Figure\\" and J\\"esus To A Child\\", while there's a brilliant reworking of \\"Heal The Pain\\" which is performed with Paul McCartney (and never has a song title seemed so appropriate!). <br /> <br />And efforts like \\"Too Funky\\" and \\"Freeek\\" capably show how the artist has consistently been able to mix the ballads with funkier offerings that ensure he retains a place on the dancefloor. <br /> <br />But not everything George Michael has done - or still does - reaches such high standards. In fact, some tracks are downright grating. Whether it's over-earnest and even drippy ballads such as \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\"  (with Elton John) or new track \\"This Is Not Real Love\\", a wretched, ponderous duet with ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, they seem to be striving a little too hard to pull at your emotions. <br /> <br />On the other side of the coin, \\"Flawless\\" is a fairly non-descript pop offering that is bland in the same way that so many chart hits are - it feels like a desperate attempt to appeal to younger listeners that marked a lowpoint in his career. <br /> <br />That said, there's still plenty to appeal to his diehard fanbase, or even more recent fans, on \\"Twenty Five\\", making this career retrospective a fascinating journey that serves to show why George Michael has remained at the top of his profession for so long. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IMV4IW|4.0|These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers.   This is not a greatest hits album.  Why so few tracks over 2 cds?  Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions.  Especially Little By Little.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I've purchased 10 copies of this DVD to distribute as Christmas presents.<br /><br />Let's make it one of the best selling and best distributed DVD's of all time.<br /><br />If you believe in personal responsiility for conserving our environment pass it on by giving copies of this DVD to as many as you can.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|What else can you say except WOW!  This guy has got to be the most underated song writer/musician/artist et al of all time.  Every thing he has put out since Closing time has been a four or five star album and this is no exception.  This is THE BEST ALBUM OF 2006.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I've listened to the whole CD, only in plain stereo. The music is pretty good.  While, i do enjoy the way they've mixed the songs (and of course the sonic quality), it's a little on the trippy side for me.  Nevertheless, still quite good.<br /><br />My problem is that the surround sound is not working for me.  The box says Disc 2 will play in ANY DVD player.  So, i was under the impression that i can still listen to DTS 5.1 from my regular DVD player...just not the hi-resoultion audio that you get from a DVD-Audio player, right?  Well, my DVD player will NOT read the surround info.  It keep sending it to my receiver as PCM stereo, and i can't change that.  I tested my other DVD's, and they play in DD and DTS just fine.<br /><br />Do i have a defective disc?  Has anyone else played in 5.1 on a regular DVD player?
1573223026|5.0|I've been meaning to say something about this book for a while. I bought it the day it came out and read it shortly after, the problem that I ran into after I read it was, I didn't want to read anything else for a while for fear that I'd compare it with this novel, and in turn, ruin the new novel that I would be reading.  <br /> <br />I told a  friend of mine, this ole geezer whose a supposed Hornby fan, to go buy it when it came out, he did, and much to my dismay after reading only a couple of chapters dismissed it as a\\"suicide\\" book. I was shocked, I couldn't believe how shallow this old git of an english major was. <br /> <br />This book is fantastic. Its about life, and to find the real meaning, as with any great piece of literature you have to look BELOW the surface. Hornby's not just going to throw IT in your face.  <br /> <br />The characters are all extremely diverse, thoroughly developed,very likeable in their own way, and the exceptional writing allows for a  seemless flow from one charater to another. You will find yourself not wanting to put this down. <br /> <br />Since I've read this, I've read \\"About a Boy\\", \\"How to be Good\\" and \\"High Fidelity\\" all for the 2nd time. Hopefully Nick has another on the way soon!! <br /> <br />Cheers!!!!!
1591391105|4.0|Something like this is a fine reminder to reset and properly engage in a new position.  I found it helpful although not radically innovative.  If you are simply looking for a nice reminder/guide of how to approach a new position, I would recommend it, just don't expect too much. <br />
B0002OERI0|2.0|didnt like this album much. <br />holiday was really good, but the rest of this album annoyed me.
B000002KDX|5.0|\\"Horse With No Name\\" may have launched America to the top of the charts in the early 70's but each song on this timeless CD has a unique quality like no other in the America collection.  Every song seems to be simply crafted but unparalleled in message.  This is a must have whether you are just being introduced to some of the classics or a true fan of the great acoustics that are a signature of this outstanding group!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This Cd is absolutely, positively amazing !!! It is beyond this reviewer how anyone could knock the magical experience they would behold, after listening to this classic, reworking of the greatest music of the 20th century. Now come on, we all know it was made for cirque du soliel. And that it was given the blessings from The Beatles entourage. Of course it's not the original visions immortalized 40 years ago. This is a collage, a work of art, a new take , whatever. It is gorgeous, immaculately done and a feast of mind blowing, mind altering proportions. There is a reason why the Beatles are the greatest musical act of all time. You will hear it on this Cd. One can only assume, that with the technology we have now, how amazing it will be, when the powers that be remaster the entire Beatles catalogue on Cd. If they are to do  a simular production on Love, as they could to the Rest of the Albums,then my God is the public in for a treat. Everything is so crisp, clear, and the voices and instumentals are perfection. The Beatles are simply genius. Buy it !!!  And to any of the reviewers who blasted this set. Please indicate what you would normally listen to. I'd love to understand what you are comparing and complaining about. Thank You George, Paul, Ringo and John. And of course The Martins for their brilliant vision.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Just got done listening to this CD for the third time. What a masterpiece! I have been waiting for years for a Beatles release in multi-channel sound. It is about time. Anyone who is in to high def sound and especially in the DTS format,will be blown away by this mix. It is spectacular.I would give this 10 stars or 1000 if possible. This album is very crisp & clear & the mix is great. George and Giles Martin have done a great, great job and I hope that in the near future they will remaster every one of the Beatles LPs in this format, especially Sgt. Peppers. By the way, I am not a big Beatles fan, but appreciate good music, whoever it is. To hear \\"I want to hold your hand\\" with such punch and clarity gave me goosebumps. It sounded like it was recorded yesterday. I am rating this on the DTS surround version and owning several DVD LP's, this is tops. Can't wait for the next one! <br />
B000J3EEBY|4.0|This CD picks up where she left off in Book Of Secrets. Its good and I like it a lot but there is something missing. Most of the songs are slow, not like on the last two. Also she is basically covering familiar territory. By this is mean that a lot of the music sounds much like the <br />last two CD's. This is basically a continuation of what she did in Secrets. Overall, its a fine CD and her voice is great but no new musical territory is explored here.
B00006X06U|5.0|...at least to these ears.  I have always appreciated Ms. Mitchell over the years and enjoyed seeing her on TV appearances.  I've never picked up any of her albums though, so I'm somewhat of a newbie with her material. <br /> <br />I took a chance on this double CD with heavily orchestrated versions of assorted Mitchell material and have been totally bowled over by the grace, beauty and artistry evident on every cut.  Joni, her orchestrator and all involved should be proud.  There is definately a smart, smoky vibe prevalent and the outcome is truly a marvel. <br /> <br />The 2nd of the 2 CDs is especially KILLER.  Every cut a gem.   If you've ever wondered what Joni Mitchell is about and like jazzy orchestral albums....start with this one!
B00005A0V0|5.0|This album is rightly considered one of the classic albums of the Canterbury progressive rock style which gained considerable popularity in the early 70's.  Caravan really hit their stride on this their 3rd album and many consider it to be the band's best.  Still with the band's original lineup this album plays to the strengths of the songwriters and musicians.  It is a great mix of prog rock, pop, and at times just plain nonsense that works on many levels.  The lyrics are very hippie-ish expressing a positive idealism that is rare in today's world.  The pop-ish tracks \\"Golf Girl\\" \\"In The Land Of Grey And Pink\\" and \\"Love To Love You\\" are all instantly humable and stick in your brain like good pop should.  The proggier stuff \\"Winter Wine\\" and the classic album closer \\"Nine Feet Underground\\" show a band at the top of their game.  \\"Nine Feet Underground\\" has become Caravan's \\"Free Bird\\" with its 22 minute length and uninhibited jamming it has become an essential part of the Caravan set list to this day.  Although the album sounds a bit dated today, it is still a great listen.  The remastered version (released in 2001) sounds great and has several bonus tracks.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|With great anticipation my 11 year old daughter (a big Beatles fan) slipped the cellophane wrapping off our newly purchased LOVE disc and carefully inserted it into our car's CD player...WOW!  George Martin and his son have worked the magic all over again!  Stepping back in time almost 40 years and using the tools of a 21st century digital studio the creativity and magic that is the Beatles is back for perhaps a final encore. LOVE sounds so fresh. The clarity, energy and detail in the music is probably closer to what it sounded like in Abby Road studios than it ever has on your stereo.  The creative license in the mixes and edits sound and feel very true to the experimental efforts of the Beatles that marked their amazing studio years.  My daughter and I had ear to ear smiles through every track.  The experience is fun, nostaligic and at the same time this project gives you that unique feeling that even in 2007 the Beatles are ahead of the times. GNIK NUS! George Martin...John Lennon would be proud!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I just heard parts of this cd but I know that it is really sublime. If somebody can now put picture ( animated Beatles) with this music, we would have an extraordinary dvd. We would see the four Beatles play those <br />songs. Today's technology permit to do this....DREAM IS NOT OVER.
B000025SJ8|5.0|While I do not think this batch of tunes from Varg are as good as Det Som Engang Var, I do think it's the most raw sounding Black Metal ever made. You have to be in the right mood to listen to this dark recording. You're not in a bad mood, but you aren't in a good one either: this is the perfect time to listen to any early Burzum, especially this one. War sounds like a horde of mad Black Metal assassins, stomping through a dark countryside, leaving every church a heap of ash and ruin. There are a lot of Black Metal bands who churn out 'cold' recordings, but none have ever managed to create a coldness on the level of a Burzum CD. If there is another to tie, it would only be early Mayhem and Darkthrone. So, you don't have to like Varg or what he stands for (personally, I think he was just defending himself), but you do have to have this recording in your Black Metal collection or it will be incomplete.  <br />
B00006F7XJ|4.0|Celebrating Camel's 30th year in the business \\"A Nod And A Wink\\" would serve as the final album in which the band would tour as a live unit.  The lineup is basically the same as on \\"The Paris Collection\\" live album with Guy Leblanc on keys and Denis Clement on drums.  Overall I don't think this one is quite as strong as the previous album \\"Rajaz\\", but there is a lot to like here.  As with \\"Rajaz\\" the choice of keyboardist has a huge effect on the overall sound.  Leblanc's keys are more symphonic than some of his predecessors and he adds a significant amount of his own style to the proceedings.  For those of you familiar with his main band Nathan Mahl Leblanc's contributions to this album we be apparent from the get go.  Not everything on this album works that well for me though.  \\"Fox Hill\\" and \\"A Boys Life\\" are both ok, but not really highlights of the Camel catalogue.  The main attraction of this album is the closing track \\"For Today\\".  The song was inspired by a person who fell to their death during the World Trade Center disaster of Sept 11.  The song actually gave me Goosebumps the first time I heard it, and is one of the strongest works Latimer has written in the entire career of Camel.  The soaring guitar solo at the end rivals some of the best in the genre reminding me of David Gilmour's classic \\"Comfortably Numb\\" solo from \\"The Wall\\".   Of the studio albums that I own \\"Nod\\" this is probably my least favorite, but it is still a worthwhile purchase for fans of the band.
0618680004|3.0|It seems as ridiculous for a bioligist to wade into the waters of theology posing as an expert as it does for a theologian to wax scientific.  It seems that Dawkins would be taken to task at some point for stepping outside of his field of expertise.  While the Bible is not a science text book it can steer the approach a believer might take as he enters the realm of science in that it forms a foundational world view.  It does not make the Christian an expert on biology.  Science in as much as it seeks clarity to the composition of the physical can shape the way a person views/approaches the divine, but it is no measuring stick for the finer points of divinity.  I wonder if Dawkins isn't just the Falwell of his arena.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I brought my 4-1/2 yr old granddaughter, my my nieces aged 15 and 9 to see Happy Feet and we all loved it.  The Hispanic Rappers were hilarious. Loved the story-line, how an outcast saved his fellow penguins from starvation by searching for and finding the \\"aliens\\"(humans) who were encroaching on their fishing grounds.  The music was fantastic!  Everyone should see this movie.
B000001DTM|5.0|This may be sacrilege to some, but I think this is a better album than \\"The Joshua Tree\\". I should qualify that statement by saying that this record has a more driving sound. It's more wreckless - sort of a traditional U2 meets David Bowie and Trent Reznor. And I like that. \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was a bit more tamed, nonetheless emotional, though. After reading U2: At the End of the World, I understand the music on this CD more. Perhaps, that is why I find this to be a better album. The band put it together in the midst of turmoil and struggle and really thought the music was good, but not thier best. I disagree. It just goes to show, that some of our best work is produced out of the chaos around us...and hopefully, when the chaos subsides, we recognize that. \\"Achtung Baby\\" is truly a 5-star work.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I just picked up An Ancient Muse yesterday and I'm completely enthralled!  I bought it at B&N and it had an extra CD with a bonus track on it.  It's just one song, but I really liked it.  It's worth it to seek out the album with the bonus CD, in my opinion.  The excerpts in the cover from Loreena McKennitt as she visited the various geographic locations which inspired most of the music were also very insightful.  I hope she continues to do that on future releases.  I felt it really added something to this album.
B000HX1L6W|1.0|I bought this album on cd and thought it good enough to spend the money on the DVD Audio version....BIG mistake. I thought at first something was wrong with my DVD Audio player..nope other discs worked fine. I took the disc back and exchanged for another one and had same problem. The music is just missing from some of the channels on some of the tracks. I get music out of some of the surround speakers but it's obvious when listening that someone screwed up mixing the music. I have a couple dozen or so DVD Audio and DTS discs in my collection, so I know what they should sound like, and although some of them turned out to be somewhat disapointing, this was the only one I felt ripped me off for $24 since I can't return it for a refund. (I tried and was told the disc was fine, it was my player!..never mind the fact all the other discs play perfect on it!)
B000JK8OYU|5.0|First of all, for those of you who might think this album is destroying the Beatles legacy, that is NOT the case. The songs on this disc are not being presented as the definitive versions or anything. This is just a very interesting way of presenting the Beatles for today's audience. What I like about this album is that with one exception, every sound you hear on this disc comes from an existing Beatles recording. The only new thing is a section written by George Martin for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Listening to the disc is sort of like a game of \\"Find Waldo\\" in which you try to pick apart the different songs parts thrown in the mix. One of the coolest tracks is \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" which gets a very spooky sound. The whole album is a listening experience. It also reminds us all that the Beatles catalog is way overdue for a mastering upgrade. We still have the original masters from 1988, the time has come to bring these up to date.
0684824906|4.0|There seems to be an abundance of books out there on Abe Lincoln. However, this is the only book I saw that thoroughly detailed both him and his cabinet. Overall, I'm impressed with Ms. Goodwin's writing abilities. From what I can tell, and from what I've heard from another historian, she is tops in her field. Though a bit too detailed, this book is an excellent source of facts and stories surrounding President Lincoln and his \\"Team of Rivals\\". 4-Stars.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|2005 saw System of a Down release two albums in the year, the second one which connects the liner notes to the first. I've been a SOAD fan for a few years now. I had huge expectations for hearing new SOAD since I loved \\"Toxicity\\" so much, and got around to buying the other albums by then. I was totally blown away by \\"Mezmerize,\\" and I know it's an unpopular opinion, but to me, that's the best work they've done. Every song on there is wonderful, and while it may not have been too serious, it was kind of refreshing to hear, and only two songs were actually political. <br /> <br />Here comes the sequel to that one, \\"Hypnotize.\\" In my opinion, the other album was a lot more moving, but this one isn't too bad. The hits \\"Hypnotize\\" and \\"Lonely Day\\" are okay, but for me, they are not what SOAD are best at. The former is well-performed but to me seems like it was kind of written to be a hit more than connect with the band's artistry. The latter has some of the band's weakest lyrics, never getting in depth on what makes the day so depressing/lonely. A tale of a prostitute and drag queen on \\"She's Like Heroin\\" is okay, but that's not really one of my favorite songs from the group, either. <br />This album is far more political than \\"Mezmerize,\\" but many of the songs deal with the Armenian genocide issues. The greatest songs, for me, don't match with the other disc, but it is still pretty good. Not as quick and quirky as the predecessor, but songs like \\"Stealing Society\\" and \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" show the group has plenty of creativity in them and are totally exciting to hear. It is also a more bleak album than the past one, speaking of some hopelessness in \\"Tentative,\\" \\"Holy Mountains,\\" and \\"Soldier Side.\\" That being said, all of those are great songs. While not as speedy as its counterpart, it still has edginess in the majority of the album. Like everything SOAD, not everyone will connect with it as it is an acquired taste. <br />As for lumping the guys with nü-metal: They transcend the sub-genre. They play faster than most of the mid-tempo groups and also unlike those, they change the tempos more often and have loads of creativity. It's not just teenage angst. \\"Hypnotize\\" is definitely a worthy listen and worth adding to your musical collection. Even when SOAD don't make completely amazing music for me, it is still excellent.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I adore Josh Groban's first 2 cds, but this last one just lacks...pizzaz. And through most of the songs Josh actually sounds more asleep than awake. His voice also sounds like it is straining at times, something that never happened on Josh Groban or Closer. His adroids (muscles in the nose) (may be spelled wrong) sound swollen, causing the nasaly sound heard in many of the songs.   <br />   Concerning the writing, Febuary Song and You Are Loved are the definite kickers, the rest (particularly the Italian ones) sound like normal songs: Girl left guy, guy complaining about it. Or guy sees girl, guy wants girl.  <br />  He's trying out new things, which I respect, but needs to switch to a new vocal coach.
0312117337|5.0|Great tool to help think about circumstances, opportunities and life situations. The cards are alive.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This is simply a stunning collection of great music.  The most amazing thing about it is that it doesn't contain much that can compare with his very, very best work.  There is nothing to compare with the best cuts on RAIN DOGS, for instance.  But imagine any Tom Waits album.  Knock off the top one or two songs and then imagine the next two or three best songs.  This three CD set pulls together some 50-odd songs of that quality, just a staggering number of very good songs.  And weirdly enough, at some point sheer quantity does become quality.  After RAIN DOGS and perhaps SWORDFISHTROMBONES, well maybe CLOSING TIME as well, this just might be the next most essential Tom Waits album.  It provides an incredible overview to everything his music is about and provides examples of nearly every form at which he excels.<br /><br />This is not a perfect collection.  For instance, there are far too many spoken-word cuts, a form I've never been fond of with any artist, though I will add that Waits is better than most.  One wonders if this would have been better as a two-CD collection.  Still, even the filler is high quality filler.  And although there is nothing on this album that will count among my very favorite songs ever, as do other Waits songs like \\"Downtown Train,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Yesterday is Here,\\" or \\"Blind Love,\\" there are a huge number of wonderfully compelling songs.  As I write this, for instance, I've been listening to \\"World Keeps Turning\\" and \\"Tell It to Me.\\"  These are not among the very best cuts on the set, but they are nonetheless immensely satisfying to listen to.<br /><br />The most astonishing thing about this set of what is basically a collection of rarities, many of them re-recorded for this album, is the sheer quantity.  This much exceedingly good music makes you wonder if Waits, despite his already high acclaim, has been underrated.  This is the kind of set that we are used to Dylan releasing, a set of occasional pieces, things that in one way might almost be considered \\"B\\" material, but that are superior to most performers' \\"A\\" stuff.<br /><br />I personally like the first two discs more than the third, though even it has some great cuts.  As I mentioned above, I'm just not a fan of spoken-word songs and most of them are on the final disc.  Virtually every cut on the first two discs is at least decent and most are far more than that.  I could list some of my favorites, but there wouldn't be much of a point; there are just too many fine songs.  Let me just say this:  if you are a fan of Tom Waits, you must -- and I really do mean you really, truly must -- own this album.  In fact, it truly belongs on the short list of essential discs.  It is an anthology, but an anthology of stuff that is more or less inaccessible.  Many Waits fans were looking forward to this set, but the great news is that it exceeds expectations.almost be considered \\"B\\" material, but that are superior to most performers' \\"A\\" stuff. <br /> <br />I personally like the first two discs more than the third, though even it has some great cuts.

B00004BZ0N|4.0|I'm not so in touch with the history of the Clash as some of the reviewers nor am I into debating how best to pigeon-hole them, I just love this record! So many great songs, so many styles, how can one not enjoy at least some of these songs?<br /><br />The title track and it's follow-up Brand New Cadillac are a one-two punch that any band would love to have laid down. The songs bounce onward with amazing smoothness despite the stylistic differences of Hateful, Jimmy Jazz, the aforementioned two, Lost in the Supermarket, et al. One could talk about what it means to be punk but I always thought it was more an aesthetic issue opposed to some instrumental or songwriting shortcomings. Give me this over the ridiculous Sex Pistols any day.
0060989157|5.0|The Dirt is a great read; one of the best books I've ever read in a while, and that's no lie. In addition, it's got some great stories from the way-back-when up until the not-so-long-ago.<br /><br />Follow the Crue from their small beginnings through the ups and downs of stardom. I loved the stories set on The Sunset Strip, partying with Diamond Dave, touring with Ozzy. The girls, the music, the drinking, the eventual burnout, and everything in between. The book provides an interesting look at life as seen through the eyes of the performer and not the fan. It's not always an easy ride, and the stories in this book are a testament to that.<br /><br />But wait, there's more...The Dirt not only tells the story of Motley Crue; it also analyzes the music industry as a whole. The Cog concept, shady promoters, royalties, and more.<br /><br />Bottom line: Fans, give this book a read before the movie comes out. And industry folks, if you're about to hit the road on your first tour, this is required reading.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Released Nov. 21, 2006, this CD was an incredible and exciting entry into The Beatles catalog! The Beatles' music was always meant to be felt and this CD is no exception. This is experiencing The Beatles in the 21st Century! A lot of people and fans got the wrong perception of this CD when it was first issued and a lot of arguments were made, none of them holding any ground because they all missed the point entirely again and again. If you haven't heard this CD yet, this is a \\"Beatles-mix,\\" a soundtrack to the Cirque De Olie show called \\"Love.\\" The Beatles' songs are remixed to flow directly into one another and pieces of songs are mixed right into other songs with incredible continuity and flow.    I had the opportunity to listen to the CD in it's entirety prior to it's U.S. release courtesy of The Beatles website and let me tell you, amazing wasn't even the word to describe what I heard! I remember about six different times that I almost fell out of my computer chair. The next day my mother, an original Beatlemaniac from 1964, got to sit down and listen to it and there were countless moments she looked like she just got shocked by a stun gun. She walked away from the computer and muttered to me, \\"It's incredible.\\"    The Beatles' producer Sir George Martin and his son Giles (a chip off the ole block if there ever was one), were asked to create an hour and a half musical soundscape using all original Beatle songs for the Vegas show. They used all of the group's original multi-track masters to create the new mixes of the songs you hear on \\"Love.\\" The project was approved by Paul, Ringo, Olivia, and Yoko. A lot of people ignorantly accused George Martin of trying to milk The Beatles' golden cow again which is NOT the case! As a matter of fact that hasn't been the case with any of The Beatles' releases over the last few years but people are too obsessed with conspiracy theories these days.    Should you buy this CD if you are a Beatles fan? Well how many ways can I say \\"YES!\\" This CD represents what The Fab Four were all about; innovation, experimentation, and most of all, the music. \\"Love\\" is, quite simply, a celebration of \\"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band To Have Ever Walked The Face Of The Earth!\\" While listening to this CD, I've been moved to tears in many different portions of it. And you certainly won't need any drugs for this CD to get you high! You won't believe your ears when \\"Blackbird\\" suddenly segues into \\"Yesterday.\\" Or when \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" become one song! Or when \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" makes four different transitions; from a previously unheard demo, to the first take, to the finished song, to an incredible mash-up for it's coda incorporating portions of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"In My Life,\\" \\"Piggies,\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye\\" all within it's last minute and a half. One of the most killer tracks on \\"Love\\" is the incredible combination of John's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" with George's \\"Within You Without You.\\" The latter's vocals and eastern instrumentation laid firmly on top of the former's rhythm section. It must be heard to be believed!    Being a hardcore Beatles fan ever since the age of four, this CD even provided a few breakthroughs for me! For example, I suddenly LOVE \\"Octopus' Garden!\\" In all the years I've listened to the song, I've always found it rather hokey. George and Giles, for the song's intro, brilliantly mixed Ringo's lead vocal with the orchestral backing from \\"Good Night\\" and the sound effects from \\"Yellow Submarine\\" before the song takes off into the standard version we've known on \\"Abbey Road.\\" But this isn't JUST the standard version of this song! There is so much more power to the track in this new remix that makes it sound fun instead of corny. Ringo's vocals sound so full and it gives the entire song a new lease on life! The same goes for \\"Come Together!\\" It finally sounds HEAVY, the way I thought it should have sounded in the first place. \\"All You Need Is Love\\" finally has a bass line and drums beneath it's opening chorus of \\"Love, love, love,\\" something that was absent before. As you can tell, there's plenty of fun on this CD but you'll find a few of the songs have minor edits, such as \\"Hey Jude\\" which is missing a verse or two (but flows seamlessly into the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" reprise).    There's still plenty of goodies to mention though! \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is featured in a full stereo mix for the first time and the first take of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (from \\"Anthology 3\\") gets a brand new, beautiful string arrangement from, who else, Sir George Martin. At the end of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" a short section from one of The Beatles' Christmas recordings (the '64 recording I believe) is overdubbed for the fade. \\"Love\\" ends with the sound of the four lads laughing and carrying on, bidding all a good night and a \\"God Bless\\" from John. A closing that's guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes.    So it's Five Stars and a \\"BUY THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN\\" from me. We've loved these Four Uncles from Liverpool for nearly five decades now and this CD should remind everyone of all the reasons why. They were good. Incredibly good. God Bless the legacy of John, Paul, George, and Ringo!
B000JJRIO8|1.0|I never thought they could put out a Pac album worst than Loyal To The Game but they finally hit rock bottom. Just like one of the reviewers below I have the originals of all these songs of course they are bootlegs but they all sound 100 times better. The original Pac's Life is one verse with Prince's Pop Life music. What's Next also is way better on the original. The only two good songs on here are Untouchable Remix, and Soon As I Get Home which uses the original. Bout time I got to the song with Keisha Cole I was ready to take the cd out which is a first for me when it comes to 2pac. Also the original Don't Sleep has Daz on it and a much better beat.  I heard this is gonna be the last Pac album they put out and I hope they are right, no need to destroy his legacy any longer. I'm done buying anymore like this, I will stick to the originals. Big dissapointment for the greatest rapper ever.
B000J103X4|4.0|The West Coast young blood did it without his mentor Dr. Dre, or the G-unit squad at his back. This time, he did it his way. Dre's discipline and strong guidance is missed at times, but The Game shows that he can produce a record and prove his lyrical genius. Guest appearances include West Coast all-stars Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, and Xzibit and an out of town guests Busta Rhymes and the king of Queen's Bridge leave attention-worthy verses on separate tracks. Production contributions come from Kanye West, Swizz Beats, Just Blaze, Will.I.Am and more. A Hi-Tek beat perfects the album's most memorable track \\"Ol' English\\" - a scar-bearing biographical journey through The Game's life on the Compton streets. In the lead single \\"It's Okay (one blood),\\" Game drops lyrics of mass destruction on the industry. The album's title track is tale of his short-lived career at Aftermath and a heart-felt ode of respect to his predecessor Dr. Dre. Despite what many critics have said, this record is NOT the sequel to the The Documentary. There is a rawer, built for the streets vibe than his former album that reminds more of The Chronic or Straight Outta Compton. Suitably, the basic West Coast representing, take-it-to-war attitude that was introduced in the first round, strongly exists in the second. His spirit is filled with more conviction. He returns with thicker skin and more passion. Like a proud Westside delegate, he stays true to his roots and represents Compton with unadulterated gangsta raps. However, too often hooks fail to excite, or simply aren't catchy enough. Also, it is often hard to differentiate lyrical content from one song to the next. It sounds like Game broke lyrics for 600 bars and distributed them over 9 or 10 tracks. While indeed his lyrics are sharply worded, you will wish he used his talent to address more themes. Despite beginner's mistakes, Doctor's Advocate defines The Game not merely as Dre's successor but as a man who can stand on his feet and make his own moves.     <br /> <br />End note: I give this album four stars only because I feel it does not consummate The Game's total potential and believe he can and will achieve more. If you want to know if you should buy it - yes! It is the best new album you will find right now, and probably for a time to come.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|That's right...I'm giving this CD 5 stars not for its innovation in \\"mashing up\\" the tracks from several Beatles songs on most or all of the tracks.  Instead, I'm rating this 5 stars because it's the best single disc of Beatles songs.  The Beatles never had a definitive \\"greatest hits\\" CD---until now.  Sure, there are popular multidisc sets like the Beatles Anthology or the \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" albums (4 discs).  The only popular single-disc hits compilation thus far, however, has been Beatles 1s.  Sure, it had all the #1 Hits on it, but it was almost creepy how unrepresentative that album was of John Lennon and the Beatles sound in general.  It was very Paul-heavy.  The \\"Love\\" album doesn't turn Beatles songs inside out.  The basic verses and choruses of the main songs are pretty much all there.  Songs like \\"Something\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are mostly unchanged from the original versions.  We get the best of their early hits, the best of their experimental years, and everything in between.  Mostly, the producers have chopped up the beginnings and the ends of the songs to make seamless transitions from song to song.  It has the advantage of being able to throw in snippets from maybe 15 extra songs that wouldn't make it to a 1-CD \\"best of,\\" but are undoubtedly fan favorites.  John's weirdness (\\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\") are represented here in a way that Beatles #1 never did.  This is the ONLY single-CD on the market where a Beatles novice could listen to the one disc and truly walk away with an understanding of what the Beatles sounded like and why they're the best band in rock history.
B00005JKTF|4.0|MESMERISING and beautiful Cate Blanchett plays the lead role of Charlotte Gray during World War 2. She is an ambulance driver from Scotland working in London but is recruited by British Intelligence into the Special Operations Executive. Why? She has lived in France and speaks French like a native. Her first interview is actually on a train as the recruiter from MI6 pretends to be a fellow passenger and engages her in conversation. The SOE was actually sent by Winston Churchill behind enemy lines to as he so aptly put it, \\"...set Europe ablaze...\\" From assassinating high ranking Nazis like Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia to blowing up German bases, you name it and the SOE did it. The SOE actually helped to set up the OSS which was the forerunner of CIA. Cate Blanchett's acting is superb in her role as she displays a whole range of emotions from love to terror and sheer dogged determination. After tough Commando training including learning how to shoot Webley & Scott revolvers, Charlotte volunteers to go into Vichy France as a courier. Her superior asks her, \\"Why do you want to go to France? You know only 1 in 3 come back.\\" Her real reason is that she hopes to find her RAF fighter pilot paramour with whom she has fallen madly in love. He had been shot down over Nazi occupied France. Parachuting into France in the dead of night, she links up with a French Resistance group and its dashing leader who confesses to her he is a Communist. I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is very well done as she lands amusingly right in the middle of a group of French boys. Her first contact, a French lady, is quickly arrested by the French Vichy Police in a Cafe but does not betray her. Charlotte has many deadly adventures with the Maquis including derailing trains with plastic explosives, and sees the ugly side of war plus the horrific effects of Hitler's anti-Jew policy. The French Maquis leader even wants to kill her when he mistakenly believes she has betrayed his group to the Nazis. They were all machinegunned down in a merciless Nazi ambush. The French Resistance leader's father is subsequently arrested by the Nazis for having Jewish blood and deported in a cattle truck. His enraged son takes revenge on the evil French philandering collaborator by shooting him dead in the heart without saying a single word. A very professional job!<br />Charlotte manages to escape back to bombed out London and meets her fighter pilot paramour whom she had believed to be dead, KIA (killed in action). There is no happy reunion because she is now in love with the French Maquis leader. Ah, women are always fickle...<br />Charlotte tells the boyish RAF pilot, \\"You're right about war. It makes fools of us all...\\" However, there is a really happy ending as she returns to France after the war to find her true love in his ancestral home, and delivers her classic line, \\"There's something I've been meaning to tell you.\\" He replies, \\"What?\\"<br />Cate Blanchett says softly, \\"My name...Charlotte Gray.\\"<br />A very moving scene. It brought tears to my eyes. Please watch this movie and see if it touches your heart too. There are excellent scenes of Franec in this movie because it was filmed in the village of St. Antonin Noble Val in southwest France.

It makes fools of us all...\\" However, there is a really happy ending as she returns to France after the war to find her true love in his ancestral home, and delivers her classic line, \\"There's something I've been meaning to tell you.\\" He replies, \\"What?\\"  Cate Blanchett says softly, \\"My name...Charlotte Gray.\\"  A very moving scene. It brought tears to my eyes. Please watch this movie and see if it touches your heart too. There are excellent scenes of Franec in this movie because it was filmed in the village of St. Antonin Noble Val in southwest France. The violin soloist Dermot Creman plays the haunting theme beautifully too. Enjoy! By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet who is a celebrated Travel, Food & Wine Writer/Editor in Asia.

If you enjoy bittersweet lyrics, melodies with a beat, swing with a hint of jazz you will be satisfied.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Fifth Beatle, George Martin, makes his case, with help from son Giles, that what is at the core, in even the smallest detail, is sheer genius. Most of the tracks work brilliantly, and you get a very clear sense of what George thought of the strengths of each of the other four by which tunes he leaves intact. For the anagram nature of the rest of it, this is the kind of project the Five of them would have done had they all survived into the 21st Century for no other reason than it is fun. And Apple was right not to let some yahoo geek screw around with the canon. This could only be done right by the master himself. At 80, it is unlikely he'll do another. More importantly, another need not be done. I'd much prefer, based on how terrific the remastering is on the core tapes, that the entire catalogue get the proper treatment, ideally from Giles. In addition, now that McCartney has the masters back of the Rooftop Concert, it would be great to release that and the Glyn Johns version of Let it Be (which is basically a mix of McCartney's first solo record and the Naked tracks). Early concerts from The Hollywood Bowl, Shea Stadium, Candlestick Park, all could do with a clean up and release. And that is what seems most hopeful about how well this turned out. <br />Again, give credit to the two Georges: it was Harrison who thought it would be great to work with Cirque du Soleil. It was Martin who realized the initiative. Martin had a special place in his heart for George (don't we all?). He said often that post HELP, the writing credits should have been Lennon-Harrison, as McCartney had essentially jettisoned his efforts from Lennon and Lennon progressively lost interest in completing his own work. Be that as it may, that Martin could listen to the tracks and know exactly where the imaginations of his former colleagues would take them is a testament to the love and professional devotion he carried in his heart for the band that is still the greatest ever. Nobody, and thisCD proves the point one more time, has ever been this good. And just wait til you hear it in DVD Audio!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I just watched \\"The Breakfast Club\\" this morning and was absolutely blown away!  The hype for this film is HUGE, but, incredibly, it lives up to its reputation. <br /> <br />\\"The Breakfast Club\\" tells the story of five teenagers, all serving Saturday detentions.  Each of these five teens represent a high school clique - there's a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.  Stuck in their school for eight hours, the students come to discover things about eachother and ultimately become friends. <br /> <br />The actors are superbly cast in their roles, and in a film with so few characters, proper casting seems doubly important.  The script flows wonderfully, covering diverse topics without glitches or awkward transitions.  The soundtrack is also refreshingly upbeat. <br /> <br />\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is not an average teen chick-flick, as one might expect.  It delves deeply and thoroughly into the issues faced by high school students: biases, cliches, parental problems, and more.  \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is truly a classic - it is a film that will be relevant as long as high school and high school students exist.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I like it, even though it doesn't have the excitement of previous Loreena's CDs.  It's been a long time for something from Loreena McKennitt, and I was hoping for something that would jump at me like most of the songs in the Mask and Mirror.  Still, I absolutely believe this CD is worth buying and buying on release day. It is quite enjoyable, though I can see why some would think something is missing. I'm giving it 5 stars because even though not as dynamic as previous offerings, it is still very good music and not a bad song in it.
B00008MOUR|5.0|George C. Scott is Patton. Director Franklin J. Schaffner's epic film of General Patton is an absorbing tale on all levels. Both George C. Scott's memorable performance and composer Jerry Goldsmith's unforgetable theme are now legendary stuff. A great WWII film.
0743289412|3.0|For such a simplistic plot and an un-horror like story, I found myself drawn in to the saga of Lisey's life.  Weird.  I give this a 7 out of 10. <br />-- review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow.
B000IMV4IW|3.0|I am a classic rock fan. There are very few bands I like after 1990. (Among them Weezer, Green Day, Nickelback and Oasis, with Oasis the best of the bunch) This compilation is an awful, TERRIBLE mixture of songs. So much essential material is left off of this set that it is obscene! Now, if you want a compilation that will introduce you to them, this is good but beware that there is so much more that is good.  <br /> <br />Lets go through the albums and see what should be here: THIS CAN ALSO BE USED AS A REFERENCE AS TO WHAT TO CHECK OUT! <br /> <br />Definately Maybe- Personally I am not a big fan of the album, all that should be here is Live Forever. Anything after that is OK, but it just isn't al album I really got into.  <br /> <br />Whats The Story Morning Glory- This album is perfect. There are few tracks I would omit. To be fair I would put 6 cuts from it on here. Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory, Champagne Supernova, Roll With It & Cast No Shadow. Also good is Hey Now and Hello. Good B-Side from this era is Round Are Way. <br /> <br />Be Here Now: All Around the World, Stand By Me, Don't Go Away & D'You Know What I Mean are the best cuts. Why they ignored this album is beyond me. <br /> <br />Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants: NOTHING! This album was godawful. <br /> <br />Heathen Chemistry: Definately a step up from the last album. Stop Crying Your Heart Out (Used brilliantly in Butterfly Effect), Little by Little and She Is Love are the ones that should be here. <br /> <br />Don't Believe The Truth: Definately Lyla & The Importance Of Being Idle.  <br /> <br />B-Sides: Round Are Way, Half The World Away, Swamp Song & Acquiesce are the best of the bunch.  <br /> <br />If you love Oasis, burn your own best of, believe me, you'll be happy you saved the money. Oasis Curious? This is a good start!
B00005JP9V|5.0|I can't wait to see this movie next month! I am also hoping Clive wins best actor too, he truly deserves it. The story line sounds wonderful, I am really looking forward to this movie.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie kicks butt. Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely terrifying as Ace. That guy can act, no s**t. I totally forget I am watching an actor. He is so cruel that his presence hangs over the whole movie and meshes with the summery-yet-dark atmosphere that it gives it a great flavor. You just know they're going to meet him at the end the whole time, and that creates great suspense. Wil Wheaton pushes a line or two but does OK, he has a tough role. Much better than Wesley Crusher.     The best part of the movie is that it is so true to life. We were all ten years old not so very long ago and that person still lives in all of us.   The lighting is really good: most of the film is shot outdoors and if it's augmented by stage lighting they did a good job, it looks like natural sunlight most of the time.     [...]    I just have to say this. When River Phoenix fades out at the end it is just plain CREEPY in light of what happened to him later. I get the shivers every time I watch the whole movie only to come to this part. A completely unintended piece of writing that became the twist that just makes watching this movie an unreal experience. This is one of my favorite movies. :  )
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this film on the big screen last spring and I just viewed some of the special features of the DVD.  I firmly believe this should be mandatory viewing for our kids in schools.  We may not be able to do much in our little lives to prevent this current administration from starting a nuclear war with Iran or North Korea.  But we do have it within our power to do something about globabl warming.  I admire the packaging of this DVD--it is made entirely of post-consumer recycled material.  For those of you who might think this is just some kind of liberal hoopla, please--you owe it to yourself and your kids and grandkids to take global warming seriously.  It is not a political problem--it is an ecological, environmental and humanitarian crisis.  Be part of the solution: plant a tree, recycle more, drive less, demand more fuel effecient vehicles from our auto makers--or better yet ride a bicycle or walk.  In the meantime educate yourself to this crisis NOW!  We all should be good stewards of Mother Earth.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|In a weird way, the title, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" fits perfectly how certain people see big concerns and social concerns even though it's an awkward and clunky title to say. Like Bill Maher said once at Just For Laughs, President Bush standing in front of a tree once a year saying \\"I like the environment\\" does not make him a crusader for global awareness. Al Gore though has been actively pursuing the need for a bigger awareness among the world to slow down and eventually stop global warming. While Gore certainly had his share of jokes during the 2000 Election, namely a monotonous speaker, here he's actually a bit captivating as he gives a presentation to a group of people about where we were, where we are and where we're going. <br /> <br />The film largely centers on Gore's presentation, or as he calls it, his \\"slide show\\", where he shows with graphs and charts mounting evidence that the world is on its way to global warming. While Fahrenheit 9/11 seemed like a big budget rant you'd see on blogs where they're trying to make us see things his way, Gore just shows us what the facts are and is passionate about what he's saying. And unlike lecturers I've seen where they spend so much time talking in science speak and you have no idea what they're saying, him and his arsenal of slides lets you understand just how the environment is changing. <br /> <br />Intercut with this is basically the \\"Gore at Home\\" scenes where he narrates things about his life such as the near-fatal car accident of his son to the death of his sister. While it does give a needed break after so much explanation and facts, it also slams the brakes on the pace. You're getting so caught up in the fact that Japan had a record number of typhoons in one year only to have it slow down with melancholy acoustic guitar as Gore narrates about his life. The film's more effective in showing his passion for his cause in the lecture rather than a bit of griping about him losing the election. <br /> <br />Now asfor the issue, I for one do feel sometimes like the issue just seems too big to handle. Yes, we do recycle, and I actually don't even own a car and spend most of my time walking or riding the bus(and this is Canada where -30 Celsius in the winter is considered a good day) but at the same time it feels like \\"me and a large group of people are going to save the world\\". Sure it can be done but it just feels like this huge project to start. Also Gore himself doesn't even offer any suggestions in the film. He does an effective call-to-arms plea about taking action and saying \\"we can do it\\" yet he doesn't say how. All that comes during the end credits and they ask to use different light bulbs and we should recycle. Um....recycle? \\"Alright ladies and gentleman here is your mission: we're to save the Earth from global warming. Our battle strategy: recycling.\\" Seems strange. <br /> <br />It's probably one of the best social issue films I've seen but also one of the more flawed but just strictly based on facts and projected figures, it's certainly a bit scary.
B00005U122|4.0|\\"In the Flesh Live\\" is certainly one of the most well-produced live music DVDs to date. The performances of classic Pink Floyd songs and Roger Waters solo material are given by an exceptionally capable assembly of musicians. Inevitably, there will be comparisons to Gilmour's Pink Floyd (sans Waters) but I am a fan of both. Well, at least I think the Floyd songs as performed by Waters are more organic and true to their original compostion than Gilmour's recent (if 12 years can be called recent) performances of the same music. But Waters' solo material has never engaged me, and as I watched and listened closely to the lyrics of such songs as \\"Amused to Death\\", I was more turned off than entertained by his tired, cynical, wordy philosophy and worldview. Each of his songs from his solo career seemed to have the same tone and message of doom and gloom, despite the small and belated hope of Each Small Candle. Waters is a clergyman preaching the very familiar and tired (and debunked)doctrine of humanism and liberalism. This is not to say that the performances are musically pleasing and accomplished, but I prefer the Floyd material over Waters' self-absorbed, self-righteous pronouncements against the human race. True, Roger's Pink Floyd songs are written from the same depressed and angry point of view, but they are ten-times more artfull and not so overbearing as his solo work. As alluded to previously, the sound and video of IN THE FLESH LIVE is terrific, including the direction, editing, and overall production.
B00005RDRO|5.0|First, for everyone who knows the film, the transfer is great, so do not worry about that. I wish there would have been some out-takes, but I did not expect it. <br /> <br />How anyone can give this less than 5 stars is beyond me. Remember when this was filmed. It is a classic, and I think that the actors actually work very well together, all things considered. There are some off-colored remarks, and it certainly is not a \\"PC\\" film, but that is what it's all about. This is an all-star cast. I highly recommend this film, especially if you are a little older. Someone in there 20's may not appreciate this film as much as someone in the their mid 30's. No special effects, no nudity (well, one scene, I guess, but nothing anyone would really be interested in, and certainly nothing gratuitus), no real violence, and nothing really meant for shock value. Just good banter, and some corny lines, so, if that is what you like, buy this, if not, you might want to rent it first. I have watched this DVD several times and have not lost the enjoyment.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Here is what I thought about this project, when I first heard, that there will be a 'mashed up' Beatles CD : This is another opportunity for Paul and Yoko to cash in. After 'Let it be.... naked' and the Anthology albums, do they really need to re-release their material in a somewhat new format again ? Is this going to be something along the line of the 'DJ Dangermice' mixes - something, that anyone with a home PC and the appropriate software could have done ?  <br />Needless to say, I did not expect much, when I bought this album..... how wrong was I !  <br /> <br />First of all, when I heard, that this is like a 'musical collage', I thought it is a collection of musical snippets, somewhat connected by the Cirque Soleil concept. That is not the case.... It is a beautifully put together album that is building up to one highlight after another - in a way, that only the genius of George Martin (with a little help from his son Giles) could have done it. It's a bit of 'Abbey Road' or Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' : An album, that it simply perfect in its entirety.  <br /> <br />Everybody knows, that the Beatles were outstanding songwriters, but what this album showcases even more is, what brilliant musicians they were. And in their newly, restored format, these recording sound better than anything that has been released in 2006. How can this be ? Looking at the technology nowadays, any band should sound better than what the Beatles have recorded on their 4 track, or later 8 tracks recorders... It is not just their outstanding talent and craftsmanship, it is the way they (and George Martin) paid attention to every little detail. Kind of in a way, how an old building still looks fascinating, where new developments are boring and put together in a hurry.  <br />It is prove, that technology can not produce creativity. Not even the most modern recording studio can hide, if an artist doesn't have any talent (like so many of today's put together releases). In most cases,\\"Garbage in\\" results in \\"Garbage out\\", no matter how many tracks you use to record your material.  <br /> <br />That said, it is fascinating, how George Martin and his son have carefully restored and combined these 26 tracks. Again, their attention to the little details is unbelievable. You have to hear it, to really understand what I try to say.  <br /> <br />Living in the age of the iPod, it has been years, since I really played a CD over and over again - usually, I just let my mp3 player shuffle through my music collection. But I have played this CD ever since I bought it, and I still am not tired of it. Even I have heard these tracks hundreds of times, this new collections made me fall in love with every single one of them again.  <br />The only thing I wish they would have done, is using the whole versions of songs like 'I want to Hold your Hand', 'Drive my Car', or 'Revolution', simply because they sound so fantastic in their new mixes. But then again, you get superb versions of 'I am the Walrus', 'Something', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', 'Octopus's Garden' or my absolute favorite, George Harrison's 'Here comes the Sun'.  <br />So all I can say is, let your ears be the judge. I still can not believe, that George Martin, who was diagnosed with hearing damage a couple of years ago, gives us this masterpiece, and the best sounding CD I have heard in many years ! Simply beautiful ! <br />And do yourself a favor : Buy the limited edition with the DTS5.1/Dolby 5.1 mix on the extra DVD. It is well worth the extra dollars !
B00005JPAJ|5.0|Such a film could be considered as a manifesto about the state of the globalized world right in the middle of the war on terror. A manifesto against that war on terror because it does not consider human needs and particularly the desires, the wants and the wishes, not to speak of the impulses and other drives, hungers and passions, of the young, all ages considered, from 5 to 35. The film shows how the war on terror creates unsolvable situations in which human beings are literally tumbled and spinned actually and really to death. It transforms divisions and divides into uncrossable barriers and frontiers and borders.The film shows how the US-Mexico border is turned into a trap for simple people, including children who are absolutely innocent of any crime and are made guilty of fantasmagoric and incredibly inhuman menaces revealing that the real menace to humanity is not on the side of the illegal immigrant but on the side of the neurotic and psychotic US government, citizens, police, and other uniformed personnel.Then the film shifts to Morocco where a busload of tourists get trapped in the mountain because two vain boys are trying to show off to each other how they can shoot a gun better than the other. It wounds an American woman and the war on terror transforms an insignificant local event into a global menace blocking the necessary helicopter in Casablanca for at least two days. What could and would have been done in twelve hours before, now takes at least forty eight hours and involves the State Secretary instead of keeping the problem at the proper level of a consul. The life of the woman is thus endangered and jeopardized by and for the political ambitions of some Washington-DC paranoid politicians. Then we move to Japan and there some deaf and mute girls nearly create a situation by trying to satisfy their sexual drives at any cost in a society where boys their age are considering them as monsters, at first, and then as nothing but live pleasure dollies. That leads to the last level of denunciation. Kids are made paranoid in our developed countries and plain irresponsible in third world countries : the latter shoot at a bus for fun because they have been accustomed and conditioned into accepting it as normal though it goes against the very grain of their culture. The association of this act to incestuous voyeurism and sexual onanism shows that it is the context we create that makes kids become what we call terrorists, though they are only kids space-out by the cultural shock that brings the two sides of a divide into clashing to the finish. And the whole film is pervaded, from title to end, with the impossibility to communicate : many languages are colliding here and there, now and then, but also all our media are exploding our codes of values, be they traditional or educational. When globalization is based on fear, paranoia and an overpowered fantasmagoric survival instinct, we can only produce a total breakdown. We have to think everything over and mend what may still be mendable or look for solutions for what cannot be mended any more.

1559409002|5.0|I first saw this film on video when it was \\"somewhat\\" restored in the 1980's.  Of course, it had the cult reputation of a long unseen film, and seeing it the first time was a bit of a letdown.  But when Criterion released it in this deluxe 2 DVD edition, I decided to try again.  I am very happy I did.  This is a real gem, disquieting, scary, incredibly atmospheric, and haunting (no pun intended).  I have always loved horror films that are quiet, that get inside your head, and really play around with your consciousness.  Films like that are The Sixth Sense, Kwaidan, Daughters of Darkness, Dreyer's Vampyr, the films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, the original Pulse), and this film too.  They don't smash you over the head with violence and gore.  They end up disturbing you in ways you can't really explain.  As some reviewers have noted, Herk Harvey, the director, made only one feature film in his life, and this is it.  He was an industrial filmmaker who worked at Centron Corporation in Lawrence, Kansas (where much of this film was shot) all his life.  He made over 400 industrial films (those cheesy, \\"how to\\" films that get parodied to death on TV).  Harvey said he wanted to make a film with \\"the look of a Bergman film, and the feel of a Cocteau one\\", and he did.  There is much to like about this work.  The organ score is exceptionally creepy, the photography is very good considering how low budget the film was, and the Pavillion where we see the souls dancing is one of the best locations I've ever seen for a film.  A note to burgeoning filmmakers:  to save money, shoot at a place that has been abandoned, but has great atmosphere (Kubrick did this with Full Metal Jacket.  Hue City was actually an abandoned gas works outside London).  Some of the acting here is rather amateurish, but it doesn't really bother me too much.  Candance Hilgegrass is actually good, playing a cold, dispassionate woman.  Her performance is rather off putting, but it works rather well here.  Some of Harvey's industrial films are included on this set, and they're so incredibly cheesy.  You can probably safely skip them.  While this film didn't do rather well at first, I'm glad it got rediscovered, and Harkey got the credit he deserved.  Make sure you buy the Criterion edition.  There are some public domain copies floating around here, and they are more than likely horrible.Harvey's industrial films are included on this set, and they're so incredibly cheesy.

B000JJRIP2|3.0|So in the grand world of Kissaholics all over the country, Gene & Co. have graced us with yet another package of songs we already know released in \\"special edition\\" packaging with new notation from not only the two mouths of Kiss, but others like Eddie Kramer, Dennis Wolloch, and various people specifically connected to the live discs in this package.  Is it worth the price tag?  It depends on your point of view. <br />I won't bore you with all the interesting little details of the live discs you already know and love; yes, this does represent (most of Kiss) at their best, which is in the live arena vs. the studio.  Kiss is a visual spectacle as much as an audio; it is hard to capture the magic that makes them what they are on a cd, but Alive! did just that.  It will always be the standard by which not only Kiss but all other live metal/rock discs will be judged.  Personally, I think there is something to be said for being on the edge of the ledge, knowing you have a 50/50 chance of either making it or falling.  That was exactly the case with Alive.  They were in the garbage can as far as album sales go, their Label was on the verge of bankruptcy, and this was their last chance for any kind of shot at stardom considering that the only thing keeping them alive was the sellout attendance of the live shows.  Sometimes, a dog performs best when it's hungry and doesn't know if food will be coming along. <br /> <br />Alive 2 saw the rich and fat take precedence among their performances- they had conquered the world, they were no longer hungry dogs, and the playing was as standard as what is on the studio albums.  I mean, if you compare Peter's solo from Alive! to Alive 2, you can hear the difference.  The effort is just not the same.  Don't get me wrong- I love Alive 2 because the songs are great, the interior packaging of the original album was grand, and the studio cuts weren't half bad either.  Actually, I think Peter's skills on the studio cuts are better than on thelive portion.  It was a sentiment of the time- by now, the marketing machine had kicked in to full gear, and it was no longer about the music.  It was about the money. <br /> <br />Years go by and we are presented with Alive 3- using a completely new line up, things sounded fresh and raw.  It was almost as if that hungry dog was back again.  Gone were Peter and Ace, and personally, I wasn't happier.  You have a great song selection here; enough classics for the die-hards, and enough current material that was a sign of the times.  I was lucky enough to see them on the Revenge tour, and let me tell you straight to your face- they never sounded or played better compared to all the bootlegs and live stuff I have heard from them regardless of whatever line up was playing.  I think, in total respect to Bruce, it should be noted that he was with Kiss longer than Mr. Original, Ace Frehley, and he is a much better fit with Kiss.  He is an excellent guitarist, and he fit in quite naturally with Kiss.  It remains a total shame that Gene and Paul never let him become a full member with executive powers because, in my eyes, he most assuredly earned it and deserved it.  Equally, you cannot top Eric Singer's performance either- his double bass technique and catchy fills over shadow Peter in every way shape and form.  I mean, compare Eric's interpretation of 80's songs to Peter's- you can tell that Eric had respect for the material in the first place.  Not only that, but he was faithful to Eric Carr's material as well, Goddess Rest his soul. <br /> <br />So the big to-do about this set is the Millenium Concert- after my first listen to Vancouver Recording, I almost threw the disc out the window of the truck.  I guess Gene was right in his summation of Peter's skills from his memoirs, Kiss and Make up- were the fans crying because Kiss were on their farewell tour, or was it due to poor performance?  I'll go with the latter.  Peter is substandard, can barely keep time, and his less than stellar interpretations of Lick It Up and Heaven's On Fire are insulting to both Erics.  It is a travesty that this was actually committed to disc.  The only high note on this one is that Ace seems to be right on the mark with his chops and his performance, which is pretty much the only saving grace for this disc.  In fact, it sounds so good that I even question if it is actually Ace playing (perhaps a few Tommy Thayer overdubs?).  Other than that, you have the usual fare here- Paul sounds great, Gene is full of himself, and if for nothing, it marked the end of the farwell tour which could have been done a lot earlier than the year 2000. <br />If you are a diehard, do yourself a favor and go pick up the dvd of Rock the Nation- Tommy and Eric are spectacular on it and remain true to the material.  If nothing else, this box set serves as an example of the greatest and the worst of Kiss.
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|I have the longshot, and with the second blaster attached the range and power is reduced. The scope could use adjusting as well. But, overall this is a good gun for nerf wars if you got more then 3 clips on yourself. If you just take off the second blaster and scop, it's a decent gun. If the barrel was a few millimeters smaller this gun would most likely shoot 50 ft or better
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Purchased the set last night and the box looks incrediable!  It opens in a neat way and the discs are the same as if you bought the individual sets in great looking folder sleeves.  The extra disc \\"hidden\\" has some fun features and the book is small but very neat with a wonderful front letter by JJ Abrams.  Very small complaint is there is not episode guide for it. But it so much fun to watch the show in order!!  JJ made a fun wonderful show that shows the many sides of ALL the characters and that makes this show one to watch!!  Enjoy every minute as it is a blast to watch time and again!! Great job by the WHOLE cast and crew that help make this show incrediable!! Thanks
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I got the Beatles \\"LOVE\\" album today..  Amazing!  I am wrapping up my first spin, but I'm quite blown away.  It sounds 10 times better then any other Beatles CD.  These mixes are extremely creative.  I'm just grining the entire time, loving every second, trying to anticipate what will happen next, and when it does, almost laughing at how cool it is!  Picking out the songs that are sprinkled in amoung the 26 tracks is fun too.  There's supposedly 130 of them.   <br /> <br />Some of the best parts are the build up between \\"Because\\" and \\"Get Back.\\"  Play it LOUD!  \\"I Am the Walrus\\" has never sounded better and more alive.  It's almost like this stuff was recorded this year.  The \\"Drive My Car\\" medley is wonderful.  \\"Mr. Kite/I Want You\\" is nuts!!  \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" has to be the highlight.  Totally cool!  \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is something else too..  with the backing being tabla from \\"Within You Without You.\\"  The vocals on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\" are so crystal clear, it's amazing.  \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is also pretty clever in its edits.   <br /> <br />Also, can't say I was excited to buy \\"Hey Jude\\" again, but this remix is great..  Sounds great and has a true breakdown at the end that I find quite gutsy for such a well known song.  I can't recommend this enough!  It is very good and quite a gem.  I give it the highest possible rating.  I feel bad for all those that can't allow themselves to enjoy this, though it will be really hard playing the old CD's now as to how bad they've always sounded..  but those are rumored to be remastered next year.  For now, all we have is LOVE..  and I LOVE it!
1932907009|5.0|This is a fun & easy to read book- and is truly the last  you'll need on screenwriting.  Blake makes it easy to understand, and helps identify the importance of structure.  Not only is writing fun - but much faster. If you create a strong log line, follow his beat sheet, and lay out your forty cards on the board - you'll be amazed at how quickly things come together. I stumbled across \\"save the cat\\" on amazon and after reading all the reviews I thought I'd give it a try and was totally blown away!! Finally something I could incorporate into my writing that truly made a difference.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|step 1. put on headphones <br />step 2. close eyes <br />step 3. listen as the beatles enter <br /> <br />simply put, beatles=music. <br /> <br />We can only wonder how much fun the Martins had mixing the greatest music on earth, the only criticism i see is lack of songs pre 1966, but anyone who purchases this should be very happy and put a smile on your face.i do believe the label should have had a warning that anyone who listens especially with headphones will tend to sing a long! <br />Can you imagine an album like this remixed with the other popular sound of the 60's-motown? me either..... <br />A final comment-I love the fact the show was built around the music and not the other way around, Beatles are second to none!
B00000IREA|4.0|I love this movie. Maybe it's because it seemed so risque as a kid, or maybe it's because Jane hates it. Whatever, it's great fun. Sure the script leaves much to be desired. And yea, the special effects suck. It was 1968, what do you want? But that only adds to its charm. It's a funny movie, more on the silly side. This is true camp and if you like campy flicks, this one has to be in your collection.
0618680004|3.0|First of all, let me introduce myself.  I am as devout an atheist as anyone else.  I do not believe in the existence of God and I strongly advocate my deep belief in how the cosmos works.  I see life as essentially a physical process and there is nothing supernatural to it.  I find that many religious ideas are harmful to those innocent children who are not old enough to make an informed decision.  But nevertheless, I find that the majority of religious people are good citizens.  Religion is people's deepest yearning for life's meanings.  As such, I deeply respect everyone's faith.  The problem I find is when people despise and hate each other in the name of religions or science.  There is no need for hatred.  We all seek for the same thing--we all seek for meanings, purpose and values in life.  We can come to different conclusions, but the most important thing we share is our deep yearning to understand life and to live our lives most meaningfully.  We can share our differences and promote our cause without carrying with us hostile feelings for those who do not share with us our values.  Hatred only distracts us from the cause that we want to promote. We all can together celebrate life and contemplate the wonders of our humanity: our intelligence and curiosity, our love and passion.  I am a fan of Dawkins.  He is my hero when it comes to evolution.  I disagree with his confrontational style and his unnecessary hostile attitude towards people of faith.  Let's all have some compassion for one another.  We all share the same journey--the journey of life.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|We've had some great albums this year - Bob Dylan's Modern Times is definitely in my top five and the new release by The Beatles named Love is superb. But it is Waits' three-disc album of rarities and oddities that is my personal favorite. This is an amazing collection. It's some of the best stuff Waits has released in decades. It has something for everyone - classics for the purists, experimental stuff for the Mule Variations crowds, and general rarities for enthusiasts. Superb, beautiful, moving, bitter, emotional: a real standout. Love it.
B000JJRIP2|3.0|I hate that kiss had to release another damn box-set to get the Alive iv cd that had been promised all these years. I have owned alives I,II,and III for years. I think i bought alives I and II about 20 times over the years, so i hate that i have to get them AGAIN and pay a premium to get alive iv ( i dont consider symphony alive 4..sorry). And as far as Best Buy goes, this is AMAZON, so dont talk about best buy. they have nothing to do with this sight, complain to them.<br /><br />Now that i got that off my chest, the alive iv cd is good. Though Peter and Aces performances are far from stellar, it has a great sound and decent song selection. And while this cd is not worth the price of the entire box set, it softens the blow a bit.<br /><br />But i consider this for completists only. Kiss would have done themselves well enough to just release the alive iv disc alone for newer fans, because i doubt they want 4 cds worth of live stuff. and i think it would have sold a hell of a lot better than this box set will. But i guess they know how to get every last drop out of us real kiss fans.. The sickness continues..
B000002UB3|1.0|I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude.
B000HT3P7E|1.0|In a similar way they ruined the first season of HOUSE on DVD,the idiots in charge of How I Met Your Mother have released a beautiful WIDESCREEN show in crappy fullscreen.After the HOUSE DVD burn I rent all TV shows to see first and being a Blockbuster person paid off this time. I'll buy this when it's the proper ratio and NOT this sucky thing. Tell your Widescreen friends...
B000000OF6|1.0|I never could stand why Queen are classics?? They are awful and they suck <br />and they certainly the most overrated band after Pink Floyd and before Pearl Jam. I just hate them..all their songs are lousy and put me to sleep especially horrible trash tunes like Bohemian Rhapsody, Fat Bottommeed Girls, and We Are The Champions. This may only contain the band's single decent song which I always enjoyed We Will Rock You. I just wish that there was a star that was -30 and a 3 stars for We Will Rock You. Stay away from albums by Queen, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and AC/DC who are trash and only meant for drug addicts! Foreigner, Dire Straits, and Metallica are much,much better! Get their albums insted.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This Beatles compilation is the best ive ever heard as in a compilation...how the songs are synced together as 1 song is miraculous. Buy it you won't be dissapointed! I Promise!
B0000062S0|5.0|This is a album that is not heavy rock like Zeppelin was. What this album is is a very loose and at times bluesy twangy jamming of their past time searinching their roots and their discovories of what they found in that sound of what they were searching for. No alot of fans wont like this but if you like a more mellow and relaxed feeling record of these two legends then this is for you.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|If you have read (and enjoyed) any of the X-men, save your $, buy the graphic novel of the original dark Phoenix saga, and pretend this movie wasn't made.  If you want to see some special effects & aren't that hung up on character development, I'd still just rent it.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you're a true goth or metal fan or you might not enjoy this.  No matter how talented the rockers are, when a band breaks out as popular as this one there's going to be negative opinions along w/positive ones.<br /><br />As far as those more interested in mainstream alternative/goth/rock then this is great.  Amy Lee is very talented.  Her live performances, unfortunately, end up being a little flat but I still love her voice.  She really has MADE the band.  Ben Moody's song-writing talent helped make the songs in this album too.  It's too bad he departed for The Open Door.  Some songs are haunting, some are deep, some are angry, some just rock out.  I love 'em all.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|This is the one album that really caught my attention when it first came out and discovered Michael Schenker who would eventually become my number 1 guitarist of all,there's really not enough space to tell the Schenker story this guy has influenced a lot of guitarists,I think he hasn't received the credit he deserves and probably never will,this is my sugestion in regards to (UFO/MSG)If you wanna have the best collection of a great guitar player I recomend UFO from( Phenomenon to Strangers in the night)and( The michael Schenker Group first to Tales of Rock & Roll)There's at least 30 MSG CD'S and also about 4 of UFO reunion with Schenker back, other then those recordings,my personal opinion I didn't care much for the other guitarists that came and went replacing Schenker except Vinnie Moore with UFO live only,If you never heard Michael Schenker before you will become a fan too once you hear his music!
B00006RINF|2.0|I saw one of their music videos playing at Walmart and thought to myself: This is really cool!  Another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of Evanescence.  I happen to be a big fan of Evanescence and I LIKE the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative.  Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.<br /><br />To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed over an album purchase.  Due to the attempt at the mainstream rock/goth I gave it the extra star.
B000ESST6U|5.0|As an opera fan, in the last 30 years I have seen hundreds of productions, of all kinds of operas, all over the world; however I can attest that this 2005 Handel's Giulio Cesare by the Glyndebourne Opera, is one of the best ever.  It is quite common to find lots of ghastly Eurotrash productions of Handel's operas, in spite, sometimes, of the great singers involved.  These \\"contemporary\\" approaches, using cheap jokes and absurd sceneries and costumes, are commonly found in most European theaters that are trying to \\"rescue\\" Handel's extensive theatrical work. For instance, David Alden's approach to Rinaldo (Munich) and Ariodante (ENO) are a sort of insult, rather than a rescue, to the greatness of Handel's music and to talented singers like David Daniels, Deborah York and Ann Murray.  It requires a real genius to stage, in a dignified and actual way, one of these operas regarded by some people as museum pieces.  Contrary to Mr. Alden, I think that David McVicar, director of this Giulio Cesare, is 100% worth of Handel's genius.  He is not alone though, in fact he is well backed by a crew of terrific singers (specially Sarah Connolly and the beautiful and amazing Danielle De Niese), by a precise orchestra (The age of enlightenment conducted by William Christie), the magical sets and dazzling costumes of Robert Jones and Brigitte Reiffenstuel and the movements on stage by Andrew George.  All these elements are perfectly balanced to make more enjoyable (almost divine) the already fantastic music of this opera.  In other productions like Alden's Rinaldo and Ariodante you have to shut your eyes to enjoy the music without the nasty burlesque interference of the stage director, by the contrary, in this Giulio Cesare you forget, at times, that the stage production was adapted to the music and no the other way around.  I highly recommend this set of 3 DVDs packed in a luxurious  case.  The extras are great too, specially the review of the plot.  When I got them I tried a \\"quick\\" check in my home theater, I got immediately hooked to it and, without even noticing, I went through the almost 4 hours of opera.  It is noteworthy the believable acting of the singers, which is not common in traditionally rigid baroque operas, this conveys a dynamic rhythm to the whole plot.  I never ever before, in a Handel's opera, cared too much about the plot or root at all for the characters.  In this production thogh, I really got involved with the tragedy of Cornelia and Sestus, the sometimes hilarious and sometimes passional (but always enchanting) Cleopatra and the evil maneuverings of Ptolomeo and Achilla. Quite a great, delightful and integral experience indeed.
B00005KHEU|3.0|I bought this CD, advertised as \\"Remastered\\" from Tango Tienda as NEW. <br />They listed their home office with Amazon as shipping from NY, however when I received the CD, not only did it arrived from ARGENTINA, but also it was the ARGENTINE pressing on SONY, the booklet consisted of a bad copy of the front and back covers, while in the middle there were no lyrics or other photos, only a black and white text of the basic credits. The RECORDING was the ORIGINAL VERSION, with only 9 TRACKS, NOT THE REMASTERED re-issue or the extra tracks at the end. It took me almost 2 months, but I finally received a refund, only because I was furious to have received an offer of 40% credit if I returned the CD. After my email, I got 100% refund. If you are interested in this CD and the distributor is NOT AMERICAN, then, email them  verifying that the CD for sale is indeed the remastered version, and not the crappy original version everybody is trying to dump on eBay.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Il Divo is playing it safe with this album, but since I love their last two CDs, I am thrilled with this one. Josh Groban is getting a lot of grief for trying something new, so you can't win. Since Il Divo sings mostly in languages other than English, you can have them playing when you are reading, or doing other things that require concentration. Their music also has a way of calming and uplifting your spirits. They have helped to keep me sane while my daughter has been dealing with a life-threatening illness. I play them loud, rotating between the 3 CDs, when things are difficult, and it really helps!!!
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is a seriously underated album. Yes, it is a transitional album but every song is flawless. <br /> <br />Station to Station- A brilliant lead song for the album with nice avant-garde electronic effects and bleeps that Bowie would later expand on with Low <br /> <br />Golden Years- A classic groovy tune you may know from the radio <br /> <br />Word on a Wing- Bowie sings with the passion of a crazy cocaine-addict  skinny thing (which he was)...and that is good! <br /> <br />TVC15- Very cool, very crazy.  <br /> <br />Stay- Next to Golden Years, it is the most \\"disco\\" of the songs but still good <br /> <br />Wild is the Wind- In my opinion, the best song on the album. Bowie sings with much conviction on this cover song.  <br /> <br />This album is brilliant and the sound quality is pristine. Buy!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Brief audio samples don't do this masterpiece justice. A pop symphony that constitutes a thorough reimagining of the most influential and durable rock oeuvre for a new century, yet one that still stays \\"faithful\\" to the original spirit. (Prepare for the inevitable purist backlash, much of it from people who think they're somehow upholding Lennon's torch by dissing George Martin.) It really needs to be experienced as a whole, and repeatedly, because some of the changes are very subtle, but nonetheless effective (for ex., the amped-up drum track on this version of Back in the USSR). Of course, for a group that practically invented the concept album with Sgt. Pepper (sorry, Brian Wilson), that sort of holistic approach is very apropos. Tracks that esp. stood out the first few go-rounds for me were Mr Kite, Hey Jude, Lady Madonna (with Hey Bulldog's nasty riff buried in the middle), I Am the Walrus (in real stereo, at last!), Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You (the former now much improving the latter, I think), and the woefully short but powerful remix of the already-menacing Glass Onion. But it's all good, and I'll be savoring it for quite some time. Thanks to the Beatles and their various official legatees for apparently leaving the Martins alone to do what they do best. Now if they'd only get with the rest of the 21st century and get their stuff out on digital formats. (End that long, silly feud of Apple v. Apple already!) Addendum: a week later and several dozen listens later, a few small complaints. The album slows down a lot at a few points, a little too much so for my taste compared to the more exuberant rest of the proceedings. As I thought about it, it seems to me that George's work is represented with too much of his pokier or schmaltzier stuff, a minor point that could have been corrected if they had replaced \\"Something\\" (a sweet but ultimately boring song) with, say, his underrated \\"Savoy Truffle\\" (but rewired, of course). Perhaps they could have also shortened \\"Mr. Kite\\" by a verse before its brilliant \\"I Want You\\" power-chord conclusion, and used the saved space to expand \\"Glass Onion\\" a bit more (which is my favorite reworking of all, but only about 45 seconds long). Finally, the one song that Giles Martin's rearranging does nothing to either improve or present in an interesting new light is Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. The staccato intro works fine, but the main addition is an annoying reed-like warble of vaguely Eastern-sounding origin that repeats over and over in the chorus at the word \\"diamonds.\\" It's a very grating noise that detracts from an otherwise beautiful track.d \\"Mr. Kite\\" by a verse before its brilliant \\"I Want You\\" power-chord conclusion, and used the saved space to expand \\"Glass Onion\\" a bit more (which is my favorite reworking of all, but only about 45 seconds long).

B000J103X4|1.0|This cd is good for beats. I recommend you take the bits and pieces of the cd where teh Game isn't rapping over it, and splice them up and make instrumentals out of each track. Almost every beat is hot. But his lyrics are just garbage. I can't listen to him talk about dr dre anymore. How many times is he going to mention \\"the chronic?\\"... He calls himself the \\"west coast rakim\\". wow. he's so fake on the song where he talks about all the \\"gangsta\\" stuff that he used to do and get in trouble.  <br /> <br />Pretty pathetic stuff, and this coming from someone who really likes the documentary, I still listen to that. <br /> <br />There are a few songs on this cd that I actually like, like the one with nate dogg or the one with kurupt and daz. Now those are west coast tracks. News Flash to game - you're NOT in NWA, never were. It's nice that you like them enough to get a huge tattoo like their slogan is yours or like you're a walking album cover for them, but they don't need you to promote them and by the way, you have nobody from the original nwa on your cd.  <br /> <br />He talks about how he was in a gang when he was 15 years old and his sisters making fun of him calling him rambo... but umm Game you were never in a gang and if your sisters were making fun of you, it wasn't when you were 15, it was probably like 15 minutes before you wrote these fake verses.  <br /> <br />He does way too much bragging about the things he's done and the stuff he's accomplished when he really hasn't done much or accomplished much either. His whole cd is riddled with guest appearances and each track is done by a different producer. And his first cd was overseen by eminem dre and 50 who all had large parts in making his cd's and writing the best verses.  <br /> <br />And before then, he was on all of these mix tapes but that was completely financed by 50 cent and whoo kidd, and due to dre's influences.  <br /> <br />My advice for Game is to step his Game up. Do something on his own, without 50 guest appearances on your cd. Do it with a DJ taht you didn't pay millions for, and write something that you can brag about later, instead of bragging about all this stuff that you never did. <br />
B000JJS8TM|5.0|It's hard to believe that this music was recorded between 35 and 40 years ago - the Martins have done an outstanding job of cleaning up the tracks and mixing them for 5.1 Surround Sound. <br /> <br />The album was hyped as a \\"mash up\\" - in which Beatles songs were blended together.  The album doesn't live up to the mash up hype - for the most part the songs remain faithful to the original recordings.  There are a few tracks that have some blending, but they are the exception rather than the rule. <br /> <br />What wasn't hyped was the new 5.1 surround sound mix, which is absolutely mindblowing.  This is the best Surround Sound DVD Audio I have ever heard.  I have an Acura TL with DVD Audio and most of the DVD Audios have been the conventional CDs with some ambient noise thrown in  the back speakers for effect.  Not so with LOVE, this DVD Audio makes full use of the surround system and provides a unique experience for some Beatles classics. <br /> <br />The Martins did an incredible job of cleaning up the master recordings - every song is crystal clear - as if it were recorded on the latest digital recording equipment rather than the analog reel to reel tapes of the 60s.  The Martins then took each instrument and placed them appropriately to create a unique soundstage.  For example - in Elenore Rigby - the violins play in the background while the voice stays front and centered.  During Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds - the drum beats sound as if they are thundering from the sky.  The guitar in my Guitar Gently Weeps is so clear that even a casual observer could pick out the chords being performed. <br /> <br />The Martins selected a good set of songs for this album for any Beatles fan. It tends to favor more songs post 1966 - but they are great songs. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the DVD Audio version of this CD - not for the \\"mash up\\" but for the incredible production value.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Just amazing. Wonderful. It's rare to find bands anymore with the talent that the Foo Fighters have. Here, of course, they are showcasing their acoustic side, leaving the loud and heavy stuff behind. <br /> <br />I have not heard an album this beautiful in a long time. There is not one weak song on here. In fact, there isn't one song that isn't breathtaking. For being live and acoustic, the songs are surprisingly full and dynamic. <br /> <br />Low price, great songs... go for you. You WON'T be disappointed. <br /> <br />PS Nice to see \\"Marigold\\" included here... it's nice to hark back to the days of Nirvana a little bit.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|A love story between a spoiled big brat and a local singer.In the late 70's,Streisand was in her Gold Period in the world of music.It was more enchanting watching Barbra herself acting and singing.Esther knew what she wanted in life aparted from being John Norman's(no-man) wife.But I don't understand what the waitress want to do with John's bottle in the bar.<br />Kris must have the skin out of stingray to supported Barb's scratchers.Going thru' the land in Dino Ferrari like a rocket is overwhelming.One must be careful with a powerful car.He must remember that beautiful things are normally dangerous,like women.Maybe he's tired of living? He didn't even feed the dogs before the tragic ending.<br />When John is gone,Esther tore up the tapes angrily.It shows that the era of 'cartridge' is over.Everything is born anew,developes,not only a star.<br />Great performance and beautiful songs.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|Come on people. If Tupac were alive he would have changed his music. So to assume it should always sound like it's from 1996 is ridiculous. Why shouldn't they use new beats and newer artists. Who cares? Tupac would have ended up callaborating with some of these people.

B000JJS8TM|4.0|I was going to post this review under the \\"Stop The Clocks\\" reviews for the Oasis Collection. However, fewer people would see it or care about it. Is it a cosmic event that these two CD's came out on the same day? If you are Noel Gallagher I think not. These two CD's are an example of what we need in rock/pop music. We want to listen to the music, not talk constantly about minor points of disinterest. Is \\"Love\\" a money making venture for the superrich? Are you kidding me? This is a great moment for Beatle's newbees to understand Beatle's diehards. What a fantastic intro to the world as it was only forty years ago. The only arguement is the high tech involved and any Beatle's fan, young or old, want this entire catalog remastered by George Martin so that it will remain the Number 1 music catalog in this world we live in. Even James Brown would probably say \\"Please, Please, Please!
B00003W8NM|4.0|I must say that the mind is a vast wide untapped universe, this film will leave many questions in your mind and you will have to watch it more than once to confirm or deny what was the intention of the story, wow! what can i say it's bold , intense , imaginative , original , enteraining uuummmmh i definitely think it's a classic and one of Brad Pitts better roles FightClub is a little bloody and violent at times, so this film is for adult only having said that i must say it's worth the journey, a must have laterz folks.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This CD is GENIUS.  Maybe I'm Amazed?  You betcha!  I have been listening to the Beatles since the 60's, was a radio announcer in the 70's, and I've got to tell you, this is a truly awesome piece of work!  Just ENJOY it . . . every song and every snippet.  Thanks to George Martin and son Giles, \\"Love\\" is the closest thing to a Beatles \\"reunion\\" we will ever experience in our lifetime.  If you're 50+ like me, get one and take an auditory stroll down memory lane -- your memories never sounded better.  And give one to your children, too.  They deserve to be treated to the musical legacy of the Fabs!
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin city wasn't really the type of film that everyone would appreciate, one must remember this film comes right out a comic book, i love Bruce Willis is like one of my favorite actors and he had the perfect voice to do the story telling, his character role was let's say typical Bruce, it can be considered a simple story with a light twist, the plot was reasonable and all in all enjoyable at least for me, i say it's worth a watch laterz folks.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I bought the CD & DVD version and am not sure what the difference is since both seem to play on my HD DVD surround sound system equally.  I haven't listened to the Beatles in a while and this product re-invents them as possibly the greatest pop artists of all time.  The quality of the voices is way better than anything I have ever heard by them before.  Some of the songs are pretty much intact with much sharper vocals while others are totally new experiences (I am the Walrus, Octopus'Garden, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps).  I love the new versions of these songs as much as the originals. <br /> <br />There are some additional things thrown in such as Ed Sullivan's introduction of I Want to Hold Your Hand and all kinds of interesting chatter by the group at the end of I am the Walrus and Strawberry Fields Forever.  Additonally several of the songs are blended in a way that is as good if not better than any danceclub DJ has done. <br /> <br />I love this re-invention of the Beatles and hope that it will open up a new world to many of the young listeners who don't realize the quality of this music that stands up there with Classical music as something to last for ages!
B0009S4IHY|4.0|What can i say this a funny, violent , comedy with lots of special effects and raw slum cinematics.<br /><br />it was bold, very funny and definitely violent, it's not a true classic to me because it lacks true story telling substance however, if you love a movie mainly for entertainment well this might be your bag, i rate it a four stars because it has replay value and it extremely funny, i think it's definetly worth looking at for a change laters folks.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|These dvd's are a joke. If you want the ORIGINAL full length movies on dvd go on ebay. You will find versions copied from LASERDISC. They are in widescreen, digital quality, original audio and full length. They are superior to the old VHS Copies and much better then these new Dvd's. <br /> <br />Viva la revolution..........
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie was a perfectly balanced psycho thriller, Seven is a flawless masterpiece it's my favourite movie of all time and one of the best film i have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />The actor and actress were well balanced this cast was perfect the storyline creative intense and beautiful, i think that this movie made me a Kevin Spacey fan, the same for all the other actors starring in this movie i must say that Brad pitt and Morgan Freeman will never ever do a better film that this one, mere words can't describe this movie you must see it and experience it for yourself, you must have this in your collection must! \\" it one of those film that you never ever forget\\" laters folks.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is what the Star Wars prequels should have been. It's got all the elements of a movie classic; good vs evil,  action, comedy, redemption, and a splash of romance, with a script so well written that all these elements blend together seamlessly for a throughly enjoyable movie experience.
B000244EMO|4.0|OK! no bashing here,this film demanded a physical presence who better than one of worlds most developed men! it did not take great acting to pull this off all you had to do was have a massive well define body, hold a rapid fire tank like machine gun with one hand and yell your lungs out there you have it a scifi hit!this type of acting worked well for the whole cast even Mr.Ventura looked good, in this movie the action was so fast pace that i did not have time to bleed, for all the short commings it was one of the most entertaining movie of that era and a definite classic well for some people it has replay value if all you want to see is a gattlin gun flatten the forest shooting at everything except the target, hey! what the heck it was fun! i liked it at the time, well again do what you will, senseless violence is a sweet franchise laters folks.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|...then you must, you must see this film.  The evidence Mr. Gore presents is undeniable.  Global warming is not a hoax as right-wing politicians claim.  Set aside any political beliefs you may have and simply view the film as an open minded adult who is capable of using common sense.  The evidence of global warming is overwhelming and disheartening.  This is an issue that must be addressed.  So watch the film and then follow any of the suggestions it offers, your grandchildren will be very thankful....
B0006J28KU|4.0|For the people who just like to watch senseless killing from start to finish you may not want to see this movie it has purpose and meaning, it is a violent mature film so don't watch it with the kids, a marvellous cast and dynamic action scences, it's worthy to be called a true classic,the two main characters are played by Robert De niro and Al Pacino basically a dream come true both men true to the game on opposite sides of the fence, this film has a steady transition and many interesting scenario taking place at the same time the character are believerble and the stories are based on real life humans conditions, i hate to give away a movie in a review i think that it robs the reader, my advise is to get it! watch it!keep it! if you walk away from this movie when the heat is at your back then heat is what you lack see a doctor ha, ha!laters folks
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Why shouldn't the master behind the Beatles' sound tamper with pop music's Holy Grail? These songs belong to George Martin as much as they belong to JPG&R, and I gotta tell ya, as not only a die-hard Beatles fan but also as a die-hard George Martin fan, this rocks. I don't care if it's for something as trivial as Cirque du Soleil... THIS. ROCKS. And it's gonna rock extra hard blasting out of my car's sound system.  <br /> <br />I couldn't give a rodent's hinder about the loss of original context, the state-o-the-art sonic upgrades or the mash-up \\"skillz\\" utilized (or lack thereof... there ARE a couple of awkward transitions that really could have been done a bit better, and, TOTALLY tooting my own horn, I have a HERE COMES THE SUN/CARRY THAT WEIGHT mash-up that sends a whole mess of tingles up the spines of those who have heard it).  <br /> <br />Further, no real worries about recycling the existing Beatles catalog for further lucre-grabbing. I thought the Anthology was a dream come true and can't wait for more of the Capitol album reissues. If I'm just a consumeristic Beatlemaniac sucker, then I'm a clam-happy one. I loved the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, too. Maybe I'm a heathen wolf in Beatlemaniac sheep's clothing. Regardless, I'd rather give my bucks to Paul, Ringo, Yoko, and Olivia than just about anyone else I can think of. OK, maybe Brian Wilson. And Alex Chilton. And the Pixies.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is an ambitious, iconoclastic plundering of the temple of tape at Abbey Road, which, to these ears, simply serves to reiterate the utter genius that powered the Greatest Rock Band Of All Time. It's utterly PUNK ROCK to screw with this stuff rather than let it become a musty museum piece. Hell, it's utterly BEATLE to do so.  <br /> <br />I have a good feeling that George and John would wholeheartedly approve of and encourage the use of the original tracks and outtakes as a palette for further creative rearrangements and revisions, although John would probably laugh and say something like \\"they still care about all that old rot\\"? Yes, John... we STILL do. We ALWAYS will. Say hi to George for me.
B000FQ4M58|1.0|I can't figure out why anyone gave this a good review.  Bat out of Hell I and II have been on my top ten list for years.   Listening to emotion, lyrics, and compositions in awe.  The compositions in Bat of out Hell III are forced and contrived.  Missing not only the emotion which draws one to Meatloaf but also the amazing compositions.  As stated this album is a lemon and I want my money back.
B000IZJZLM|1.0|I listened to the whole album on AOL. Go have a listen before you put down your money.
0780622553|1.0|...the reviewers, that is. This movie was painfully boring (to me; obviously many people liked it) -- just one big \\"Who cares\\". Everyone's memories are fake? Then why should I care about any of them? Certainly not the perpetually frightened-looking \\"hero\\", who does nothing but be buffeted about by the whims of an all-powerful group of aliens. Oh but wait, he's all-powerful too. Convenient for justifying cool special effects, but a terrible way to make an interesting story.<br /><br />The only possibly interesting thing here is the atmosphere -- dark, darker, and black. I guess for some people that's enough, but to me it's not, period. I liked The Crow, and love Blade Runner and Matrix. These all had interesting stories that took place within well-explained sets of rules. Dark City doesn't. Note to writers: If anything can happen, then I DON'T CARE. You've just written a mindless sense-fest. I might as well just close my eyes and burn myself with cigarette butts.<br /><br />In fact, here's an idea for a flick all these Amazon reviewers should love: Guy wakes up in Hell. We don't know anything about him, except that he's wearing black leather. Every day the Devil shows up and tortures Guy with some hip, CGI-based form of torture. This happens many times. One day Guy, through no virtue of his own, discovers a way to kill Devil, and does so. But he's still trapped in Hell, which is Very Very Dark. The End.
B000I5X81K|5.0|What a great CD!  Josh Groban has such an incredible amount of talent and it completely shines through in his latest offering.  Fans will not be dissapointed.  My recommendation is to get the internet-only version with the bonus tracks.  My favorite of the entire CD is \\"Awake\\" and unfortunately that is not on the standard version.
B00005JNS0|2.0|First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said. <br /> <br />Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good.. <br /> <br />However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though.. <br /> <br />This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD.. <br /> <br />Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself. <br />
B000F7CMRM|4.0|i went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it.  maybe \\"enjoy\\" isn't the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot.  in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks.  but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out.  it succeeds here.  it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence.  Sure, it makes the Gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say \\" it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side\\"..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|I dunno, just don't get the hype about this band. Yea, they sound a bit like Zeppelin and Purple mixed with the White Stripes, but the songs are boring and repetitive and the lyrices are terrible! It just sounds like obvious 'hipster' ironic plundering to me. If you want to hear this stuff done right, then listen to Zep or the White Stripes. If you want to hear some new bands doing 'retro' type stuff, try The Sword or Priestess, both of whom blow Wolfmother away. Way overrated, don't believe the hype!
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Meat Loaf's voice has never been better but the quality of songs on Bat I and II was vastly superior. \\"The Monster Is Loose,\\" \\"In the Land of the King...\\" and \\"If It Ain't Broke...\\" are excuses for shouting. On the other hand, the duets are all terrific, and \\"Alive\\" and \\"Blind As A Bat\\" are exceptional. Onbe other complaint: the album could have been five minutes shorter and not lost a thing. \\"Seize The Night\\" seems to drag on forever.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|Having been a Doors fanatic for 32 years (I'm 45) I was truly looking forward to this box set.  While I have the previous 3 sets (I'm including \\"Boot Yer Butt\\" here) I was still looking forward to a set that has surround sound capabilities, has been re-remastered, has some real outtakes, some video and whatever updated and insightful liner notes are available.  In short, this set delivers on most accounts.  The re-remastering really does sound better than the previous all album box set.  The sound is both warmer and punchier...like a really, really good vinyl version might sound.  Thus far (I've plowed through about half) the liner notes are somewhat insightful if not a bit technical (I'm really referring to \\"The Doors\\" on that one). The outtakes are cool but some stuff you've already heard and the rest is for the really faithful.  The packaging is fine, the peephole being a hoot.  The only gripe I would have would be with the surround sound options.  I have a rather old receiver that converts to DTS but only if DTS is a separate option.  The default to 5.1 doesn't exist.  Bottom line though is if The Doors are your passion (you all know who you are) this set is well worth the scratch.  Grab a drink, settle back and break on through...again.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If I could give this CD 10 STARS I would!!!!! <br />Kudos to George Martin and his son Giles for creating a brilliant piece of work!!!! I am Glad that George Martin chose this as his final project it will go to serve his legacy quite well!!! <br /> <br />The song arrangements are brilliant. I especially love Drive My Car/The Word/What Your Doing,  it really blew me away!! <br /> <br />Being a life long fan of The Beatles, I knew right away this would be great placed in the hands of George Martin and his son, for any Beatles Purists out there who are hesitant about buying this, DON'T be the experiment worked out perfect!!! Isn't Experimentation what The Beatles were all about??
B000JJRIP2|4.0|THE BAND: Alive!, Alive II, Millennium Concert: Paul Stanley (vocals, guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Ace Frehley (guitar, vocals), Peter Criss (drums, vocals). Alive III (only): Paul Stanley (vocals, guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Bruce Kulick (guitar, vocals), Eric Singer (drums, vocals).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (2006) 4 discs containing 69 tracks and lasting over 291 minutes. Disc-1 (\\"Alive!\\" 1975) at 77+ minutes; Disc-2 (\\"Alive II\\" 1977) at 74+ minutes; Disc-3 (\\"Alive III\\" 1993) at 73+ minutes; Disc-4 (\\"The Millennium Concert\\" 1999) at 66+ minutes. The case is a 5-side cardboard foldout. Included with the discs is an extensive 72-page booklet containing numerous band photos (many unreleased), band members, song titles/credits, excerpts from band interviews, and all original artwork from Alive I - III. Digitally remastered sound. Label - Mercury.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Alive!\\" is always going be the album by which all Kiss records should be judged. It stands on its own - a true 'live' rock classic. \\"Alive II\\" is 3-sides live and 1-side studio recording... good, but not a classic in my book. \\"Alive III\\", in my opinion, is probably their 3rd best 'live' album behind their \\"MTV Unplugged\\" release which is not featured here (their \\"Alive IV - Australian Symphony\\" album isn't either). \\"Millennium\\"\\" is good and exciting to hear - but after several listens, maybe you'll feel the same way I do now... that it's cool for us fans to have, but it's easy to recognize the original four's playing is beginning to slip. In some songs, Peter Criss' beat is fast and then slow; Ace's guitar solo's are familiar, but they are at times sloppy; and Paul's singing is sometimes to fast, while other times he's trying to catch up. Nothing negative to say about Gene, though I wish he had more time vocally on Disc-4 (only 4 songs with lead vocals, and 2 of those he shares with Paul). \\"Millennium\\" has some old classics done nicely... most notably \\"Firehouse\\", \\"100,000 Years\\", \\"Do You Love Me?\\" and \\"Black Diamond\\". Kiss fans will eat this up as I did. \\"Alive II\\" sounds good since I never replaced my old vinyl on CD. I thought \\"Alive III\\" always sounded great, but the sound is crisper and deeper and the remastering is a nice improvement. Bonus track - \\"Take It Off\\" a song dropped from \\"Alive III\\" sounds fantastic. The radio single edit of \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" from their \\"Alive!\\" is not needed... approximately 40 seconds is chopped out of the song. Like others have noted here, I too ran to Best Buy to get the 2 extra tracks (\\"2000 Man\\" and \\"God Of Thunder\\") only to be duped. The 2 bonus tracks are nowhere to be found. The folks at Best Buy are/were clueless (most are teens and early 20-somethings that don't appreciate the old classic rock bands from yesteryear). This is also the first time that either of the first two \\"Alive\\" discs are available on a single disc. Some will say this boxed set really isn't necessary, but for the price, the new \\"Millennium Concert\\", the remastered others, and the extensive booklet make it worth the purchase. A wonderful package featuring a lot of music despite its minor flaws (4.5 stars).Black Diamond\\".

B000002ORU|5.0|Possibly the most re-packaged band in the world, the Who has more greatest hits packages than they do studio albums. This is the best. <br /> <br />This four-CD set covers everything a Who neophyte could ever want.Every hit. Every great song. All meat. No filler. (OK, maybe you would also want the Live At Leeds - Collector's Edition to get a truer sense of the Who live but that's nitpicking.) <br /> <br />For the initiated, the first disc is essential. The two demos from when the brief period at the beginning when they were called the High Numbers is the sign of things to come. They reveal how great the band was right from the beginning. <br /> <br />Who acolytes who bleed the Union Jack will want this collection just for the soundbytes alone. Listen as Pete Townshend belts Abbie Hoffman with his guitar at Woodstock. Remember the great humor of the band, as refelcted in the sound of their banter before recording \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". <br /> <br />The booklet reflects the completist nature of the set, with copious notes for every song, essays that capture the essence of the Who and a typically impenetrable writing contribution from the ubiquitous Townshend. <br /> <br />This disc accomplishes the impossible. It gets it all right. A must for every rock-and-roll collection.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|So when was the last time you plopped a music disc in your drawer, and INSTANTLY loved what you heard? It's rare nowadays, but that's what happened to me when I played this compilation for the first time. The songs are timeless, and I was singing along with them with my first listen. <br />Move over 50 Cent! <br />Move over Britney! <br />Move over all of you \\"current\\" artists! <br />Make way for the true kings of music! <br />The Beatles are heading back to the top of the charts! And only 40+ years afer their first release! <br />I think this will be an easy prediction, don't you all agree? <br />Wow! <br />I've listened to the 5.1 DTS mix of this compilation 3 times already, and if you can't tell by now, I love it! <br />An amazing compliation it is, too. <br />For those of you \\"Beatle fanatics\\" that aren't too sure of this \\"mix\\", give it a try. What you'll find is that the songs primarily are intact. But with the added intros and endings on each, it all comes together as one \\"really big show!\\"  <br />George and Giles Martin have done an excellent job in putting the \\"pieces\\" together to make one fluid \\"show\\". It's like a SUPER encore performance of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And what a show it is! <br />Don't miss it! The price of this set is well worth the price of admission. <br />I wanted it to go on and on even longer than it is. <br />The music is so crystal clear and the bridges between songs so original, it makes for one amazing show!
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This is a 3 CD set & Tom shines throughout! I cannot say enough about this CD. On top of that, if you get the limited edition, you will get the best CD cover design & layout ever to hit the music stores! a 94 page hardbound book of lyrics, pictures, etc. designed by Johnny Brewton of X-Ray Press fame. This is a Grammy Award nominee for sure & cover would be a sure winner if they awarded one in this category!. You cannot top this package and what it contains!!!!!
1582403589|5.0|I have always liked Zombies, who doesn't.  So when I first saw Marvel Zombies, I had to have it.  I mean super hero zombies, how cool.  That is what I thought anyway.  It was a terrible story, pretty disgusting, and a real let down.  But thankfully, to get free shipping I purchased The Walking Dead Book One, at the same time.  I could not put it down and finished it in a couple of hours.  As soon as I was done with it, I went back to Amazon and ordered the rest in the series and even preordered the next ones.  Great interesting story line and characters.  The only problem is waiting for the next book to come out.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|La combinacion de un guitarrista experimentado con uno de las mejores <br />interpretes del jazz contemporaneo es una explosion musical llena de energia y atinadas combinaciones.

B000AU9UYM|4.0|I've seen the previous Batman movies. This one is by far the best. Just the \\"feel\\" of the movie is so different than the other ones. It's still kind of dark, but I think it has more action and substance. Not so typical as the other ones. <br /> <br />I've probably watched this movie 5 times so far.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|By all means try to get the best quality out of these recordings but why mix two or more songs together into a pointless medly.  This is only slightly better than Stars on 45.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Wow... This is a MUST have for anyone who has ears. This is a great tribute to the greatest bands EVER! This is a very fresh twist to all the songs we love. When my wife and I first started dating, she asked me why I love the Beatles so. After what I felt was rambling for 30 minutes about the music and the meaning behind the music and how it tugs on each and every heartstring of mine, I felt like I hadn't really accomplished much. Well, after hearing the first three tracks on this CD, I ran over to my wife and just thrusted it into her face, like a kid with a new toy, and said \\"THIS IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY FOUR YEARS AGO!!!\\"  <br /> <br />As she listened, she just said ...\\"wow.\\"  <br /> <br />If this review helps anyone who is pondering getting this, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. Bravo to Giles Martin for the masterpiece. May GOD bless you all.  <br />
B000EOTAM6|2.0|This movie is a great example of what's wrong with too many action adventure movies these days.  The concept is great, the special effects flawless.  Charlize Theron is terrific in the role.  The directing is wonderful.   <br /> <br />What's the problem?  They forgot that even with action movies, you still need to tell a story.  The plot has one small twist, then lies as straight as a road through Montana.  It is sort of kind of a detective \\"uncovering the information\\" plot, but none of the information uncovered is surprising or even interesting. <br /> <br />You are not told how Aeon Flux gets to be a super ninja babe, and she barely has time to establish herself as one before she has to start revealing her softer feminine side in the stereotypical way these movies require.  None of the characters in this movie are compeling.  They hardly show the bad guys doing bad things so you aren't really all that invested in them getting their comeuppance.  There is no real tension in the movie, there is no last minute saving of anything, and not really that much of a threat that gets overcome.   <br /> <br />Overall, it was a cool idea, but they should have hired some actual writers who had a sense of storytelling to do the script.

B00003CWPL|2.0|Do you not understand modern art?  Or does 50% or more of the art in MOMA confuse you?  If you answered yes to either of these questions then this film is definitely NOT for you.  If you answered no... well, this film still might not be for you.<br /><br />Do you like to watch people walking around?  A lot?  Walking everywhere?  If you watched a documentary of someone, would you be pissed off if they cut out anything at all, including scenes where people just sit around, or perform mundane activities like making salads?  If you answered yes to these questions, then this film is DEFINITELY for you.<br /><br />Eraserhead is an experiment in patience (on the viewer's part.)  It starts slowly, the (meager) plot unfolds slowly, and it ends slowly.  Nothing is lost by watching this movie 2x-4x (except the... unique... soundtrack.)  There ARE some interesting/worthwhile scenes but they are few and far between.  There are however, many riveting scenes such as someone getting out of bed, in bed, and out again, someone else walking, walking, walking.  People sitting on a couch.  A woman ululating for no apparent reason.  And many many more.  I don't know about you, but my dreams are more interesting than this.  This film really could have benefited from having 30 minutes or more cut out, but it seems to me like the director felt it necessary to pad the film with unecessary scenes in order to make it 'feature length.'  It's possible to have an artsy film not be boring (see Space Odyssey, Waking Life) but I think you need a little more than what is presented in this film.<br /><br />If you've never seen this movie before and don't really know what it's about, I highly recommend you rent it first.  This film is not for many people.<br /><br />Since this film is about 1 quarter interesting and 3 quarters boring, I give it 1.5 stars, plus .5 stars for a good job on the baby.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|A splendid trip through the Glass Onion. This release is for the die hard fans like myself. For the casual fan of The Fabs I wouldnt suggest this disc. Knowing the catalogue inside out is a must to fully appreciate the idea behind Love. The songs are not just remastered but remixed. They're all new takes on the old songs. <br /> <br />With that said, I started with track one and initially after hearing the first couple of songs I was not impressed with what was done at all. Then it began to gain momentum. They were smart,The Martins, by having the disc gain steam as it goes along. Afterwards I was in \\"Love\\". <br />  <br />Stand out tracks are Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You, a brilliant psychedelic marriage of words and song. Especially nice for those who werent keen on the Indian vibe the first time around. I never had a problem with it in the first place. Mr Kite!/She's So Heavy/Helter Skelter -- just listen to its brilliance. The acoustic While My Guitar Gently Weeps has a new string arrangement ... makes you feel \\"home and dry\\". I always preferred the demo version with the additional lyrics but this arrangement just adds so much to it. In Lady Madonna theres a bit of the Hey Bulldog riff thrown in. The songs always belonged together. Strawberry Fields Forever may just be the best of the lot ...just hear it for yourself. <br /> <br />And for those who appreciate 5.1 surround sound this is the first Beatles release in this format so thats a plus too. Im looking forward to the entire catalogue being updated on CD. Its been a long time since their CD releases in 1987/1988. Its time...'The Walrus said'.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Foo Fighters se eleva a un p&uacute;blico m&aacute;s adulto tranformando sus temas y presentandolos de forma ac&uacute;stica y en vivo, con una ejecuci&oacute;n y puesta en escena magistral que los aparta del muchas bandas de rock, que temerian mostrarse de esta manera.<br /><br />Excelente trabajo de Foo Fighters apto para todo p&uacute;blico.
0060930349|1.0|I had bought a copy of Harold Evans \\"The American Century\\" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives.
0843178108|5.0|I've bought a few of the Mr. Men books for my son as I grew up reading them when I was his age, growing up in the UK.  I find that a lot of the really good children's books are 10, 15, and 30 years old.  A lot of the new books are books about nothing.  Nobody gets offended but the tree that died to produce a boring inferior work. Anyway....<br /><br />Mr. Noisy is a really noisy person (a big round red blob with hands, feet and eyes) who is rude to Mr. Butcher and Mrs. Baker (who are an item??;)). They then get together and conspire to change Mr. Noisy's rude and noisy ways by simply pretending they are deaf.  After going to bed hungry (and with a little more encouragement) Mr. Noisy changes his brash ways and everyone is happy.  Don't you love those happy endings?!
B000JJRIO8|3.0|This album has a lot more of an R&B sound than the typical gangsta rap sound of Pac's previous albums.  I won't go into the issue about how all these people who never knew or could probably care less about Pac while he was alive keep coming out of the woodwork talking about how great he is.  But, the album itself is somewhat disappointing. The beats aren't that good and all the other artists dominate most of the songs. Still, it's hard to complain about having so many new releases from an artist that's been dead for a decade.  I guess you'd expect to have a lot of people who think they know what Pac really wanted, when really, only he himself knew. Whatever anyone takes away from this album will have to decide for themselves if Tupac Shakur's image and music has been exploited by other people after his death, or if he would appreciate the continuation of his message. <br /> <br />The one quote in one of the songs on thus album, Pac's Life (track 2), he sums this up pretty well. \\"Why's everybody caught up in Pac's Life, to all ya'll ***** conversatin' on my life, mind your mother f***ing business.\\"  It seems like none of the other artists who put their name on thus album saw the irony in that verse.
0375831002|5.0|There are so many things to like about this book that it's hard to be succinct.  But I will try to bring out some of the things that I found most wonderful about this book.<br /><br />The narrator, Death, tells the story of a young girl who learns to read from a book she steals when her brother dies and her mother leaves her in foster care.  Her growing literacy helps carry her through the tragedies of suffering through WWII Germany.  On the surface, so simple but developed in a complex and meaningful way.  Death has been a narrator before but his \\"humanity\\" is what makes him interesting and different here.  We who are readers may understand the importance of literacy to life itself but rarely does it have the impact Zusak gives it here.<br /><br />What I also found incredibly interesting about this novel is the respect it has for the German people who lived under Nazi rule during the war.  Liesel, the main character in this book, and all of her family and friends are German.  Only once and briefly, when an Allied pilot crashes his plane, does a non-German make an appearance with no words.  It has the kind of impact Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front creates by not villianizing the enemy.  Instead, Zusak makes them humans--good and bad, weak and strong.  Powerful storytelling.<br /><br />These are deep and complex characters.  Not only are Death and Liesel wonderfully drawn but there are a host of other characters worth knowing.  Liesel's best friend, Rudy (who never gets his kiss in life--ah, the regrets of youth so well drawn); her foster father, Hans, with his patience and his accordion; the Jew, Max, who opens Liesel's eyes in more ways than one.  And the mayor's wife, and Rosa, the foster mother, and the gang of thieves, and all the residents of Himmel Street.  All, in their own way, unforgettable.<br /><br />Add to that a human and engaging plot with a unique prose style enhanced by the typesetters art and you have a book that stands head and shoulders above most other things being published today.  This is an amazing book.oulders above most other things being published today.  This is an amazing book.
B0000507R0|5.0|Music Direct sells these and the other \\"hard to get\\" DVD-A's for $17.99 to $24.99. Don't get burned by unscrupulous selers!!
B000I0QK74|2.0|How surprised I was when I started listening and realized that the music on this CD is identical to the James Taylor Hallmark CD from 2004!!!!!  There is one song that isn't on the Hallmark CD... but other than that - reruns!  I just can't believe that JT is in need of money so much that he would release the same music, in different order, and with a different cover photo.  SAD.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This album is a perfect example of what good music is all about. Beautiful melodies, excellent arrangements, heavenly voices, all come together in Siempre to create an outstanding masterpiece. The voices of these four talented men are simply amazing, perfectly blended to create the most beautiful sound you've had ever heard. Their exquisite sound will stir emotions, feelings, and romance.  <br /> <br />The samples are too short to really feel the whole Il Divo experience, buy the CD, I can assure you, you will play it over and over again, give it a try, you won't regret it. <br />
B0001I561E|3.0|While I do like this movie for an adult, I don't think this should be rated G. It has quite a few things in it that people with high values would not want their children seeing. Here is a list of the ones I can remember:    1. At the beginning, one of the \\"bad guys\\" says that he just \\"slit someone's throat\\".    2. There is a part when Aladdin first meets the Genie where the genie has half-dressed girls all dancing around Aladdin and rubbing their butts against him. My young child looked at me with a puzzled face on that part, and made a comment.    3. The Genie often changes himself into women and starts talking in that type of voice. Then in another part says how much he likes Aladdin, but that he won't be \\"picking out curtains with him anytime soon\\" or something to that effect. Luckily children won't get this joke, but it could still be considered offensive.    4. There's another part in the movie where the princess is being controlled by the bad guy, and when they show that he has taken over, she's all the sudden in these very skimpy clothes. My child asked me at this part, \\"Why did they take off her clothes?!\\"    I would've never bought this movie if I had watched it first. At least not for a child. I just thought I should post this point of view in case there are others out there thinking of buying this movie who wouldn't want their children seeing/hearing these types of things.
B000I5X81K|5.0|after listening to this spectacular CD and watching the DVD, this is a absolute must have for any lover of good music. josh groban, now being called THE VOICE , shows a maturity and versatility in his 3rd, and most awaited cd. while he still sings the classical style we are so used to in MAI, un dia llegara, l'ultima notte and the song from the 1968 romeo and juliette, he also sounds wonderful with ladysmith black mambazo in WEEPING and LULLABY. he rocks in MACHINE, with herbie hancock. but without the bonustrack were he sings AWAKE, you are missing the most beautiful song. the singles \\"you are loved\\" and solo por ti have gotten lots of play on the radio. watch the DVD, josh is super funny. learn more about him, and if you are not yet a fan, you will be now and turn into a grobanite.
B00005JPCD|3.0|What attracted me to Happy Feet was the advertisements where the baby penguin sings an excert of \\"The Message\\", by GrandMasterFlash. I thought it was cute. Plus the cast looked strong. Happy Feet's cast most notably features Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphey, Robin Williams, Nicole Kidman, and Hugh Jackman. All actors give the best performances they could with the material they were given, sadly the material is average at best. The story is very cliche', centering around a misfit penguin(named Mumble) who lacks singing ability, and has a nearly compulsive urge to tap dance. Apparently this is the worst thing you could be among this particular penguin community. There is also a food shortage and Mumble(Elijah Wood) takes it upon himself to slueth it out with some newly befriended penguins. He also has a love interest(Brittany Murphey), as predictable as that is. <br /> <br />I thought that a great amount of the comedic dialogue and actions were sexually charged. A lot of the jokes were about \\"getting with the ladies\\". And some of it was a bit disturbing, the female penguin eating a fish out of the male penguin's mouth. The way it was done sounded and appeared borderline sexual. The sexual messages in the film are very clear to any mature person of 12 and older. This film really feels more like something an adult should go to either alone or with a friend. Most of the film is penguins lusting after eachother.  <br /> <br />I thought Elijah Wood's character didn't have any charisma or likeability, besides the part where he's a baby. Hugh Jackman's character was just okay too.  Really the only great performance in the film was by Robin Williams.  It's sad when an almost secondary character is more entertaining than the leads. Otherwise Happy Feet is quite dull. The CG is excellent, and the musical aspect is strong enough, but I feel this could have been much more given a bigger and better cast.  <br /> <br />It's really hard to tell what Happy Feet wants to be. It begins extremely dramatic, and the realistic look of the film really tricks you, and made me question whether the marketing campaign was misleading. It really wasn't, but be warned, since you may not find this out otherwise: Happy Feet is not a film I would label as a comedy, nor a drama or adventure. It's a mixture of these things, like so many CG/animated films before it,  it tows that line. But it doesn't do a particularly good job at it. I don't think the seriousness of the film mixes well with the comedic side like it should. Perhaps I'm over-observing here, but then again the characters themselves aren't entertaining enough to make me overlook the film's weak spots. <br /> <br />Some of it is even a bit offensive, as noted earlier some of the interactions between the penguins were a bit disturbing, and definitely sent messages that are better geared to an older audience. Yet, in my local theater, children outweighed adults easily. This is not a family film, as you would be led to believe. Alas, it's subjective. I personally decided not to recommend the film to my family for these reasons, this is most definitely not Finding Nemo.  <br /> <br />Happy Feet is fundamentally a musical, although admittedly in a lesser sense than what might pop into your head when I say this. The singing is generally quite good, and it's not surprising seeing Hugh Jackman and Robin Williams belting it out, considering Hugh is on broadway and everyone's seen Robin in Alladin. Song selection is definitely geared towards a mass audience. Obvious, but you'd expect no less. I guess it's okay to be obvious if you're billed as a \\"family film\\".  <br /> <br />I would recommend you see it in the theater if you really must see it at all, just because the sound and beautiful CG animation are best appreciated in that setting. But if you have surround sound and a decent television, wait for Happy Feet on DVD, maybe the special features will add some enjoyment to the film.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This is the first time I was anxious to lay my hands on a CD on its release day. I wasn't disappointed. Nor was I blown away. <br />Loreena's singing and music are strong as usual. I particularly liked the melody of the opening invocation: the voice seems to emerge from the darkness, unbound by tempo or harmony, open-ended, formless, profound. The instrumentation in \\"Caravanserai\\" is amazing, as is the poised tempo. \\"The English Ladye and the Knight\\" is a lovely rendition of Scott's ballad and my favourite track on this album--not as dynamic as \\"The Highway Man\\", perhaps, but infinitely rich and moving with the dirge-like tempo, etheral choral background and Loreena's heartbreaking, soaring voice. <br />The other songs, however, are a bit on the conventional side and appear to recycle former materials. \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" reminded me of \\"Marrakesh Night Market\\", \\"Penelope's Song\\" of \\"The Two Trees\\", \\"Beneath the Phrygian Sky\\" of \\"Night Ride Across the Caucasus\\", \\"Never-Ending Road\\" of \\"Dante's Prayer\\", except the precursors tended to be stronger. The album is still worthy of Loreena McKennitt--only that I think she could use a breakthrough, like the one she achieved moving on from \\"The Visit\\" to \\"The Mask and the Mirrors\\".
0743289412|3.0|I purchased this book the first day it was available in stores and all the reviews online were screaming 5 stars and raving about how great the love story was.  It took FOREVER to get into the plot of this novel and even then I found myself trudging through just to finish the book so I could move on to another one.  I kept hoping that something amazing would happen towards the end to make it all worthwhile, but I was left disappointed.  I think this book was comparable to Dreamcatchers as it kept going on and on but never really got anywhere that made sense or made you say \\"WOW!\\"
B000JK8OYU|3.0|more of a \\"novelty\\" than anything else.Interesting for one listening,but that's about all.Absolutely love THE BEATLES,but this is not what I'll be reaching for when I want to hear the best music ever made.

B00005JPBP|3.0|I enjoyed this film but came away rather unsatisfied.  It was a show about magicians, magic, competition, and obsession but never seemed to develop any charisma or real emotion. The initial accidental and predictable death never rang true as a motive for all of the death and destruction that followed.  Nevertheless, the film does keep your interest and keeps you guessing.  After all this is a film about deception, lies, and secrets so the plot twists are plausible at least right up until the end which is totally implausible and I think it is this implausibility that caused me to only give three stars.  I cannot fault the actors who did a fine job and Michael Caine is always a pleasure to watch, so I think it was the screen play that was weak, although this weakness only surfaced at the end.  I thought the film was worth seeing and it was entertaining, but unlike many of the other reviewers here I didn't think it was \\"one of the best movies of the year\\".  It certainly wasn't the quality of \\"The Departed\\" which is indeed one of the best movies of the year and academy quality.  \\"The Prestige\\" is entertaining but not a great film.
0843175621|5.0|Another Mr. Men book I own that I would say is one of the top 5 in the twenty or so we've bought for our son.  Poor Mr. Bounce goes to town to see Dr. Makeyouwell so he would stop bouncing about quite so much.  But along the way to town he becomes part of a tennis game (ow, ouch, oooowwww) and bounces off the bus, through the window, and straight into a hot cup of Dr. Makeyouwell's coffee!!  Mr. Bounce is then outfitted with a pair of heavy boots but.....Mr. Bounce should have bought a better house! (Crash)<br /><br />A must have for your little one's Mr. Men collection.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|My mother and I went to see this film and we both left in awe and amazement. The setting, the tender, beautiful love story, the acting - EVERYthing - was just incredible in this movie. From the music to the great twist at the end, it's one of the best films I have seen all year. And makes me love Edward Norton that much more, because once again, he did a fantastic job!<br /><br />Definitely give this movie a chance, you won't regret it!
B000IMV4IW|5.0|Stop the Clocks deserves the respect of hardcore fans and past fans of Oasis. The band has been making music for the past 12 years, haven't lost their touch, haven't sold out to make pop or rap, and, after 12 years, still revolve around the once-known-to-be fueding brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, the voice and soul behind one of the most exciting and unpredictable bands in recent memory.     Clocks delivers a retrospective of Oasis's bumpy career thus far. To no surprise, most of the songs, which were all compiled by the Gallaghers themselves as songs that, according to them, encapsulate their band's best contributions to modern rock over the past decade, are from their first two albums: Rock 'n Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, and Slide Away from the 1994 breakthrough debut Definitely Maybe; Some Might Say, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova from the 1995 mega hit follow-up What's The Story Morning Glory. Other classic hits include the UK number 1 hit Go Let It Out from 2000's dud Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, the Liam penned ballad Songbird from 2002's subtle Heathen Chemistry, and the UK number 1 hits Lyla and Importance of Being Idle from 2005's solid Don't Believe The Truth. The boys even manage to thrown in 4 great b-sides, which sound better than most of the singles they've released to date: the brilliantly written acoustic ballad Talk Tonight, the sentimental The Masterplan, the arena rocker Acqueisce, and the stunning Half The World Away.    The only flaw I find on the compilation is the title: Stop The Clocks is a song Noel has been writing, rewriting, recording and re-recording over the past 5 years; someway, somehow, it would have been nice to have this song included on the compilation instead of causing some sort of confusion, and even misleading some music-goers to the content of the album, but that's Noel Gallagher for you!    Besides that, both the collection of classics and the band still rock on!Recommended    A
B00005JPCD|5.0|Shows that being an individual has its own rewards. Hilariously funny, one of the best times I've had at the movies in years. And the animation was equal to about anything I've seen come out of Pixar/Disney. So there were some sexual connotations, that's what Emperor Penguin singing is all about. Finding the right song, from the right Penguin of the opposite sex to mate with. That was the shame of Mumble's lack of singing talent.     Also shows the conservation value of a few captive species. The better to appreciate creatures we probably would never have a chance to see in the wild. \\"Out-of-sight, out-of-mind\\". Thus the fate of the Penguins and their need for fish in order to survive was championed. If only the nations of the world would realize, that we must gather food from the sea sparingly.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|i love jane austen and i really enjoy period pieces. but the main character was the WORST actress i have ever seen in my life. she was boring, weird, ugly, and never changed her expression. i dont kno how anyone could love her. i could barely understand what they were saying. a terrible film. i hated it.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Mind-blowing is the word I feel best describes this album. After the abomination that was Angels Fall First, who would have thought Nightwish's second album could be this masterpiece? The opening track, Stargazers, shows off Tarja's voice terrifically, as does Gethsemane. Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean is the darkest, most theatrical track, and Sacrament of Wilderness evokes images of snowcapped peaks and deep pine forests. Passion and the Opera through The Riddler are all good songs, but not as interesting as the rest of the album. The Pharaoh Sails to Orion is a haunting Egyptian tune of cobras and shifting sands, as well as the story of Exodus. Walking in the Air, a Howard Blake cover, and Sleeping Sun are calming ballads with enchanting vocals. The best thing about this album overall is the atmosphere throughout. The cover art absolutely captures the feelings it evokes. Rock on!
B00005JMK0|5.0|It's funny how some things stick with you your whole life, while most things you experience don't. This is one of those movies that touch the soul. I saw this movie over 20 years ago and have not forgotten how good it is.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series. This show is unique in that it really captures the essence of being within a group of friends. It is at its best in episodes where characters that do not usually spend time together alone end up in a situation together. And unlike most other series, the characters all grow and change over time and it really does keep the show fresh. <br /> <br />Now on to this specific release... I purchased each individual season on DVD when originally released and I have read posts that state this is just new packaging, but are you all sure? I have a few questions: <br /> <br />(1) Are the extras in this release all in the season by season packages? <br />(2) Are these episodes full screen (Standard) or widescreen (1.33 to 1)? <br /> <br />All the separate packages for the 10 seasons were full screen. I know when the series started widescreen was rather unique in television. I prefer the widescreen but do not want to shell out the bucks for a whole new set if they are all full screen. I would also consider getting the new release if there are new extra featurettes that are different from the original individual season releases. <br /> <br />Does anyone have any information about these 2 concerns? <br /> <br />As always, thanks for any feedback/information.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|...turned into a biography of Al Gore instead of a movie dedicated to discussing global warming and environmental issues. For those wondering what the movie is REALLY about, you should be prepared for about 60% of the movie covering the global warming issue framed by the other 40% that runs like a overview of how Gore became who he is today (son hit by car, sister dies, loses vote to Bush). Are his experiences important in making him who he is now? Sure. But does it detract from the overall power of the information? Yes. Crafty packaging and media buzz has seen fit to gloss over those aspects of the film and those who are expecting a feature length documentary on global warming (like I was) will have to deal with 45 minutes of close up shots of Gore pecking away at his Apple PowerBook and talking about growing up on a farm. This movie gets three stars only because the INFORMATION is so important.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is among my favorite Christmas movies. This movie's strength is in the understated characters. I can honestly say that only one person is overacting in this film, (guess who?)  and it works. It's easy to forget this is a fantasy. The actors were so laid back it comes off like a simple family tale. Kudos especially to Ed Asner, whose gruff but kind Santa is among the best portrayals of the Jolly Old Elf in cinema.  And I still rewind every scene Faison is in.  <br />
B000JJRIP2|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, yes, kiss did yet again re-release itself again...kinda the George Lukas with Star Wars of the music industry. For Die hard fans, they probably swallowed their pride and bought this because it does come with the Millenium concert CD, originally thought to be released as \\"alive IV\\", but wasn't until now.  And, speaking of Alive IV, Did they forget about it?  Anyway, as a moderate Kiss fan, I do Like this new package. It has the Three ALive! disc, the mellenium concert, and a nice book, and all for cheeper than buing all three of the Alive's seperately.  It is a nice compliment to Their 5 cd box set. It is a good way to expand your kiss collection quickly, and have the Classic album that Made them. Now, as another person points out, the Best buy version was to have 2 Bonus tracks \\"2000 man\\" and \\"God of Thunder\\" from the mellenium concert. I bought mine at the store, sticker on the front and all...and THEY DO NOT EXIST.  They are nowhere to be found on any of the discs. I am awaiting a reply to an e-mail I sent Best Buy online, and the stores have no clues.    So go ahead, save the cash and buy it online here at Amazon, you'll get the same set likely cheaper.  I give it 4 stars as a set, it's Classic Kiss, in one neat package.  You wanted the best...you got the best, available now.
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha was definitely not a page turner.  There wasn't much plot or intrigue, and most of the \\"good stuff\\" when Siddhartha was living the life of sin, growing rich, gambling and loving in the big city, was skimmed over instead of closely narrated.<br /><br />However, in a society so obsessed with wealth, personal gain and even personal relationships, it was interesting to read about a character who valued none of these things and only sought to discover his own inner self.<br /><br />Although Siddhartha's life and quest are vastly different from my own, I was able to take something away from his insight and experiences that I will be able to apply to my own life.  So, although it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat while reading it, I believe it is a book that will continue to pop into my mind and inform me as I grow in my own direction.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Great cd, give it three tries. The cd doesn't hit you at first with the strength of Fallen. It puts most people off at first. Me i like all kinds of music so I felt more open to it. Don't expect the same thing, is all.  <br /> <br />The first song that hit me was 'good enough'. The songs do seem to run on a similar tone, and the sound is different from the other cd, yet listen to it three times, read the lyrics first. Did u really want a repeat? But alas, it was just a bit sad for me, tho i love it. It hit me well as I related to it, especially their first hit.  <br /> <br />I wish they did a few more strong songs like this first one. I love the gut of strong music myself, rock- anything loud. It seems she took the emotional route, but thats what artist do. They evolve. I'm glad they did, and I hope they take many more routes in further cd's giving us the many sides and emotions in life. I do miss some of the power the other cd had, but the relaity of her words...you can feel her pain. Its like a living emotion and ones we can all relate to.  <br /> <br />like lithium. I can see a girl crying and rocking in pain as she cries Like i have cried before. The visual power the words and song can have out weigh so much more. The way Amy and the band deliver the emotional aspect is acute and right on. once you know the words then u start to hear the difference in the songs. I like the new take, though the cd is very sad. Take it as it is with no pretense, expect nothing, and i think you'll enjoy it. Too much hype kills so many good things.
0316776963|3.0|I'd heard great things about this book, especially how hysterically funny the author is.  I suppose his humor just isn't my style.  Many of the stories were mean and made his family out to be grotesque beyond belief.  Perhaps David Sedaris' family is accurately portrayed here, but I find that hard to swallow. <br /> <br />My major problem with this book was the tone of the narration; Sedaris seems so self-satisfied, and in my opinion he thinks he is much wittier than he really is.  This attitude came through in his stories and was a real turnoff to me. <br /> <br />However, some of the things he wrote did make me laugh and won me over to some degree.  I don't find Sedaris a brilliant comic writer, but I don't feel my time reading his book was completely wasted.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I have all of Yanni's Concert DVD's. This one includes SOME of his 'older' pieces, but also has some truley AMAZING newer pieces (Playtime, On Sacred Gound, etc)! <br /> <br />First off, the musicians are all VERY talented. What I love about all of Yanni's concert DVD's is he allows many of the individual musicians time to shine, they aren't just part of a large group of players. <br />Here you will see just HOW talented AND inventive the musicians can get. <br />For instance, you've heard a harp played before, but with THIS much passion and enthusiasm?! There's a piece where 2 PVC pipes are used (ala STOMP) to make rhythms that are wonderful! <br />The vocalists are right on! The 2 lead violinists are there for their 'duel' (like in Acropolis), which I always loved. Karen Briggs isn't on hand this time, but this IS Yanni's tour program, so possibly she wasn't available for an entire tour, BUT the 2 lead violinists do a WONDERFUL job! <br />There's a dulcimer player who is absolutely amazing the way he plays, and it's a great time to hear it played if you've never heard it before, OR to have is played like THIS! <br /> <br />Now, I will admit, I'm pretty used to Acropolis & Tribute, so when I FIRST watch this DVD it DID take me some getting used, but I couldn't put it down! I don't know where the talent comes from with Yanni, but you can SEE he really feels the music inside him. That's something wonderful to see- a composer who FEELS the music, not just conductinc others. <br /> <br />One note- the piece 'The Storm' is nothing short of breathtaking! <br />It starts off slow, with a cello solo, but it's based on Vivaldi's 4 Seasons and Yanni really punches it up! If you're not a fan of the slower classical pieces this one in particular will blow you away! The violinists really DIG into this peice and, well..I thought they'd saw their violins in half! <br /> <br />All in all...another spectacular, and sometimes moving concert!!! <br /> <br />
B00005JPCC|5.0|Very difficult to review this. The critics herein have spoken from bad to better than ever. I must say I agree with them all. Take it in perspective and realize that the baby boomers, who were initially aroused by Dr No, will probably be the most critical. Give some consideration to the necessary editorial license that requires contemporary themes and ideology. <br />  So. If this is a legitimate prequel to past Bond adventures it's quite good. He has not yet achieved a 00 status. He's rough and tough but has not yet matured into the Bond style and charisma that we have grown to expect. The \\"bull in the china closet\\" has a lot to learn.  <br />  True Bondians require that insane campy villain. They require it \\"shaken not stirred\\". The bevy of Bond girls devouring the screen. The wry sophisticated humor. That comic book effect that transposes the viewer into a dream world of excitement and adventure. <br /> The cinematography and action sequences are top notch. The plot...a bit complicated but OK. The cast...OK. Giancarlo Giannini and Judy Dench exceptional. <br />  The score is eloquently done in pre-007 style. A brilliant piece of cinematic magic takes place at the end. Or is it the beginning?   <br />  Daniel Craig as James? Time will tell. After all....Bond is back. <br />  Carry on..... Commander.
B000GPIPVU|3.0|Besides this CD, I purchased 3 others (different artists). All I can say is that after putting this on, I don't listen to the others.I just can't stop listening to this disk. Blues, a touch of Dixieland, Beatles , etc. influences are expertly woven into this original and unexpected music.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|After a decade, it's nice to have a new Loreena McKennitt CD!<br /><br />... even if it IS perhaps her least innovative work to date. Sorry to say it, but there's much familiar ground covered here.  In particular, McKennitt seems to be revisiting musical realms already visited on MASK AND THE MIRROR (M&tM).  I don't simply mean in the style or choice of instruments; there are melodies and arrangements here that strongly echo tracks from that album (and other albums of hers).<br /><br />Even so, the CD is a joy to listen to.  I love the thematic thesis for this album--McKennitt as the wandering minstrel, collecting old stories as she strolls through the Mediterranean--and ultimately I like this album better than M&tM.  McKennitt is one of those artists whom, even when she produces something imperfect, is still producing something much more beautiful and worthwhile than the majority of artists out there.<br /><br />Now, hopefully it won't be a decade (or even half a decade) before her next one!
B00005JPCY|4.0|Everyone's had that feeling of deja vu, right? That unsettling sensation that you've done this before, or said this before, or have seen this before - but you just can't pinpoint it? DEJA VU (French for \\"already seen\\") takes that unsettling sensation and comes up with an incredible explanation: time travel. Now, I love time travel stories, and I'm also a fan of Denzel Washington, so it was a no-brainer that I check this one out. DEJA VU is the third movie in which Tony Scott directs Denzel Washington (the other two were CRIMSON TIDE and MAN ON FIRE, two excellent films). With DEJA VU, Scott and Washington come up with another searingly pulse-pounding thriller.<br /><br />The plot revolves around ATF agent Doug Carlin's attempt to solve two cases: the terrorist bombing of a New Orleans ferry which causes more than 500 fatalities and the murder of a woman whose corpse had washed ashore an hour before the ferry explosion. In his investigation, Carlin ends up working with a federal surveillance agency which boasts a new hush-hush toy, called Snow White. Using key space satellites and a high-tech program, this agency is able to somehow look back in time for the past four days and six hours and witness a constant stream of selected events unfold on various monitors and screens, complete with crystal clear video and audio. However, Carlin and the agency discover that the individuals being watched can sometimes feel their invisible eyes (thus, partly explaining the feeling of deja vu). That leads to Carlin questioning just how far they can affect the past, which then takes up the rest of the movie. I'm trying not to give away any more of the twists and turns, so I think I'll stop right here with the plot breakdown.<br /><br />DEJA VU is a gripping film which will elicit some conversation from the viewers after it's over. Now, the first half of the film is set at a leisurely pace as, for much of the time, Carlin and the surveillance group are busy, well...surveilling; it doesn't go into overdrive until almost an hour into it. The intellectual sci-fi/fantasy aspect is meshed nicely with enough action and suspense to satisfy both the high- and low-brow audience. One standout action sequence showcases Denzel in a metal-rending car chase as he pursues a vehicle from the past, meanwhile still destructively maneuvering his way thru traffic in the present. Some very nice automobile bashing.<br /><br />Denzel Washington, of course, drives this movie with another forceful and charismatic performance. Denzel, as everyone knows, can certainly bring in the scene-chewing intensity with the best of 'em. In fact, the implausible premise and plot would  totally come off as ridiculous were it not for Washington's credibility. Denzel's fiercely cool and intelligent acting persona of past films proves to be crucial here as the audience instantly buys into the likable actor's character. His ATF agent, like most of his past roles, is very capable, independent, intelligent, and not at all gullible, so when he gets over his skepticism and finally accepts the reality of the time machine concept, the audience is right there with him.<br /><br />But Denzel's not the only one who dazzles here. Paula Patton is really convincing as the beautiful, angelic victim. She could pass for Rosario Dawson's sister, she's so fine. And that smile! It isn't hard to see why she left such an indelible impression on Denzel's character. Val Kilmer is effectively subdued, while Adam Goldberg provides the funny. James Caviezel, on the other hand, strays pretty far from Christhood. It's a good cast.<br /><br />So what if the ending might make veteran time-travel aficionados erupt with a \\"Say what?\\" or a \\"Now, wait just a minute!\\"? Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott combine their vast experience of professional film-making to come up with yet another patented slick looking effort. With an intriguing \\"what if?\\" premise, some very riveting sequences, combined with the wistfully romantic touch of LAURA and the skills brought along by an acting superstar and a winsome, gorgeous female lead, DEJA VU is a bonafide thinking man's knuckle gnawer. So, yeah...go see it.stfully romantic touch of LAURA and the skills brought along by an acting superstar and a winsome, gorgeous female lead, DEJA VU is a bonafide thinking man's knuckle gnawer.

0553573403|5.0|Someone noted this is not fantasy but instead historical fiction. In the defense of such opinions they trot out that it has little violence (wait for book two), no non-humans (see latter statement), and no magic (see...) as if this are the standard to which all fantasy is to be measured. I beg to differ. Folks of such opinions should reread any pre-T.H. White King Arthur book and just about any Pre-Tolkein fantasy novel. GHORMENGAST has no monsters, little (if any) magic and little violence and yet is considered a true classic of Fantasy. So is CONAN and his ilk, and not one dwarf to be seen. This was the norm until Tolkein came along. However even the esteemed (and I surely do) Tolkein's LOTR has little violence until book two. Little magic to boot. Unfortunately so many out there consider the tropes Tolkein (may or may not of) set up now are the true measure of fantasy and forget that, like in Sci-Fi, there is more than one way to tell a story.<br /><br />Most of the greats today, from Tanith Lee to C.J. Cherryh consider fantasy to be caught in a rut and they are right. This book and it's follow ups will hopefully end this rut and give writers the courage to stop trying to copy Tolkein (no one can) and take fantasy into both old and new directions.<br /><br />Fantasy was once a story told about another time and place were things were \\"different\\" and Martin's work is that. Its complex, dark, dangerous, violent (hey, killing is killing!), ugly and yet beautiful in a way our world could never be. The \\"good guys\\" are sometimes bad and the \\"bad guys\\" sometimes good but you have a villain or two to really hate and a few spunky folks to root for and you never know if your favorites are going to survive. Sure most of its grey but you definitely get the idea that the Lannisters would NOT make good stewards of the kingdom and are at the very leat dishonorable. The Starks make some boneheaded calls to say the least, but the mistakes are made for such honorable reasons you can't but help but yell at the pages over the injustice of it all. It also makes clear why history is so often made by scoundrels, or at least those willing to play by scoundrel rules. Add in so many characters just trying to make it through the climbing chaos and you have rich tapestry of pain and triumph you'll be engrossed in.<br /><br />Yes, AGOT is NOT typical fantasy, but thank goodness for that. Its a plausiable and believable world (so many forget THAT is what made Tolkein'd wors so great) with a realistic society, religion, politics and history you can BELIEVE in.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show on February 9, 1964 and have been passionate about their music ever since.   <br /> <br />This is one of the most exciting releases from the greatest group of all time!  This is the ultimate treat for Beatle fans.  Non-fans will enjoy it, too, but they won't understand the excitement.  As for the purists who will likely find the whole thing offensive, if you don't like the concept, you don't have to listen. <br /> <br />Sir George Martin and his son Giles have taken the classic Beatles catalog and turned it on its ear.  This is a good thing!!!! They have pasted different elements of songs together to create something new and exciting. <br /> <br />The way the different songs meld so seamlessly is just astonishing.  Listen to the strings from Good Night as Ringo sings \\"I'd like to be under the sea\\" and the sound effects from Yellow Submarine can be heard in the background.  This brought tears to my eyes.  Hear Drive My Car meld into What You're Doing and then The Word.   <br /> <br />Listen to the stunning harmony of Because.  Magical!!!  Marvel at how an instrumental passage from Blackbird connects to Yesterday. <br /> <br />I am absolutely blown away.  This is beautiful and amazing.  What a magnificent gift this is to the lontime fans whos will discover things they have never heard before.   <br /> <br />I am not an audiophile but I suspect the Martins have worked on the sonic quality of these recordings. In over forty years this music has never sounded so crisp and clear to my ears. <br /> <br />Beatlemania lives on!  Thanks to Sir George, Giles, Paul, Ringo, Olivia, Yoko, and John and George!!!!!!  Brilliant!!!  What a great time to be a fan!!! <br /> <br />
B000AA305M|5.0|Sometimes, it just sucks to be famous.  David Gray scored such a huge hit with White Ladder that now everybody is either a fan or a hater, and I can't imagine what kind of pressure that puts on him as an artist (and he is an artist--check out his first two albums for further verification).  No matter what any Joe Schmo off the street (who saw David Gray on TV one time and hasn't even listened to this album but is willing to give it one star) says, this album is worth your money.  Why?<br /><br />David Gray is one of the best songwriters and lyricists making music today.  Most of the reviewers here rail on the tempo of the music.  Yep, a lot of it is slow, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  Every song is packed full of words that mean something and read like poetry--check out the brilliant three-part storytelling in \\"The One I Love.\\"  \\"Lately\\" shows Gray growing as a music writer, putting the song in 7/4 time and locking the band into that hypnotic rhythm.  \\"From Here You Can Almost See the Sea\\" is another stretch for Gray, who usually doesn't sing in falsetto.  \\"Ain't No Love\\" is probably Gray's single most lyrically deep and challenging piece to date--at first listen I was blown away by the desolation and world-weariness embodied in his well-crafted verses.  \\"Hospital Food\\" rocks just as hard as anything else Gray has ever done, with another biting chorus, and the finale, \\"Disappearing World\\" has one of those golden priceless musical moments that you won't want to let go of.<br /><br />All in all, I think this album stretches Gray's songwriting and lyrics farther than any he's made before.  I could personally do without the production--some of the instruments and backing vocals don't really add to the sound of the album, and I predict that in about 10 years the reverby, computer sound that accompanies this popular Coldplay-like production will sound oh-so dated.  Regardless, David Gray has what Coldplay doesn't--depth and skill at songwriting, and an ability to write material that has merit outside the trappings of studio production (and isn't all about adolescent relationship problems).<br /><br />The album is slow and it takes some work to get into, but that's part of what makes it so enjoyable--if you want music you don't have to pay attention to, this isn't the right place, and it would be a waste to have Gray playing and no one really listening.  If you want loud, fast punk with shallow lyrics, this also isn't the place.  It may be slow and quiet at times, but the words scream louder than any bad power chord ever could.rite material that has merit outside the trappings of studio production (and isn't all about adolescent relationship problems).   <br /> <br />The album is slow and it takes some work to get into, but that's part of what makes it so enjoyable--if you want music you don't have to pay attention to, this isn't the right place, and it would be a waste to have Gray playing and no one really listening.

0679720200|2.0|I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.<br /><br />I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.<br /><br />Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.<br /><br />Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.<br /><br />But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.<br /><br />But! I liked the parts I read \\"okay\\" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.<br /><br />Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you \\"keep on keepin on\\" like they say.kay\\" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well. <br /> <br />Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you \\"keep on keepin on\\" like they say.
B000J10ER4|5.0|I just returned from my local ShopRite supermarket and they had both the fullscreen and widescreen versions already available before the 28th. Unfortunately there was no 2 disc special edition available. I don't care. I grabbed the widescreen version anyway. I've waited long enough. Can't wait another 6 days. BTW, the ShopRite I went to was in Staten Island, NY. Not sure if it's a local thing or what, but I would check anyway.

B000JJRIO8|5.0|Even though this is an entire CD of calaberations this CD is finally of the quality that made Tupac the greatest rapper of all time. Every beat is on point and doesn't anoy you which was a problem on some of the previous postimus releases. Tupacs rymes are never an issue for the most part, but this time seems as if they finally pulled out the cream of the crop. All the other artist on this one seem to have been properly placed as well making a perfect blend. This is by far the best postimus release yet not including The 7 Day Theory which was done before his death.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, having high expectations placed by his past work. However, my expectations were not met. I prefer the beautiful ballads full of passion (where's the \\"To Where You Are\\", \\"When You Say You Love Me\\", \\"You're Still You\\", etc?) There are only a few songs on \\"Awake\\" that I enjoy. <br /> <br />\\"February Song\\" is the type of music I love to hear from Josh. This song is fantastic and my favorite on the CD.
B00005JPCC|5.0|Bravo, Mr. Bond, Bravo.<br /><br />James Bond (Daniel Craig) earns his double O status with two kills and M (Judi Dench), believing he is not ready, reluctantly sends him on a mission. In Madagascar, he trails a suspected terrorist. But their cover is soon blown and the bomber runs, causing Bond to chase him through a construction sight. Eventually, Bond secures the bomber's cell phone and finds a cryptic text message. ELLIPSIS. The same phone leads him to the Bahamas and puts him on the trail of Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a financier for terrorists. After Bond thwarts one of his plans, and Le Chiffre loses a lot of money belonging to a lot of dangerous men, the villain sets up a high stakes poker game at Casino Royal in Montenegro. The buy in is $10 million with an additional buy in of $5 million; there is a potential $150 million to be won. If Le Chiffre wins, he saves himself and continues to operate. M sends Bond to play; he must win and bankrupt the villain. A treasury official, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green, Bertolucci's \\"The Dreamers\\") tags along, to keep an eye on the money. Before long, the game comes down to a match between Le Chiffre and Bond, winner take all. Along the way, Bond falls in love with Vesper and they soon share a holiday in Venice. But neither can get away from trouble for long.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\", directed by Martin Campbell (\\"GoldenEye\\") and written by, among others, Paul Haggis (\\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Crash\\"), marks a remarkable return to form for the venerable franchise. But as I stated to my companion, all three of the former major Bonds had their memorable turns as the deadly secret service agent. With the exception of Sean Connery, these films were usually followed by a series of forgettable entries. \\"Moonraker\\" anyone?<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\", based on the first book written by Ian Fleming, has inspired the filmmakers to return to the secret agent's roots. The famous pre credits sequence features a brutal fight between Bond and his first kill, the first kill qualifying him for double o status. Throughout, there are references to how he is not ready for the assignment, how unrefined he is, how egotistical. And Craig fits this bill perfectly. He isn't the suave man of the world we are used to in this role, but we see how he may grow into the character. One can almost imagine Craig becoming more refined, more charming and more suave, becoming Sean Connery. Craig is very good as Bond, bringing a raw physicality to the role matching his so called `raw nature'.<br /><br />There are some terrific action sequences, most of which are in the first hour or so of the film. As Bond chases the suspected terrorist through Madagascar, they quickly invade a construction sight and Bond's quarry keeps him on his toes. If you have seen some recent martial arts films or the recent \\"District B13\\", a French film produced by Luc Besson, you will recognize the technique used by the suspected terrorist. It is called \\"free running\\"; basically, the character ricochets down walls, elevator shafts, hoping back and forth, using railings, walls, etc., barely making contact before bouncing off again. It is a unique and interesting addition to the film, as it creates a sense of free flowing movement. This stuntman is actually doing this stuff and he appears to be doing it very fast. It is all the more unusual because Bond isn't doing it, relying on pure luck to keep up with the fast guy. Eventually, they end up grappling high above the ground on a tall crane. Because this style is used sparingly, confined to one sequence, the scene seems unusual and interesting, providing a more unusual moment. When an entire film is filled with this, it just seems a bit silly. Campbell was right to confine this to one scene.<br /><br />As Bond follows the leads, he romances women, visits exotic locales and the filmmakers have some fun with the origins of the legend. For instance, in the Bahamas, Bond enters a poker game with one of Le Chiffre's henchmen, Alex Dimitrios. Soon, Dimitrios puts his 1964 Aston Martin into the pot. I don't think I need to tell you what happens to the car. There is also an amusing reference to Bond's signature drink.<br /><br />Soon, Bond is on his way to Montenegro and meets Vesper Lynd. Craig and Green seem to have a lot of fun verbally sparring with one another. And Green shows some Bond girls can hold their own against the formidable secret agent. Upon their arrival, Lynd fines an evening gown provided by Bond. Then, he finds a tuxedo provided by Lynd, each thinking they have one-upped the other. This is followed by some verbal sparring which provides an amusing look at their new, growing relationship. Convincingly, they also let romance bloom. And, of course, their romance makes them more vulnerable to others.<br /><br />Once they reach Casino Royale, the story becomes more relationship driven. We see a romance develop between Bond and Vesper. We watch the interplay between Bond and Le Chiffre. We watch the British agents work with Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and we meet Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), another participant in the high stakes game, who, late in the film, reveals to Bond he works for the CIA. I get the sense both Giannini and Wright will make further appearances in the next few films. Leiter is a recurring character throughout the books and Mathis is set-up to make a return appearance.<br /><br />But the real game is between Bond and Le Chiffre. Mads Mikkelsen is almost great as the villain, because he builds his menacing persona with quiet stares (using a scarred eye) and a level tone. This is not the villain of yesterday, no more Blofeld with his diabolical plots to contaminate the gold in Fort Knox, no more Drax and his plan to build a colony of perfect people in outer space, while he destroys all plant and animal life on Earth and no more Stromberg and his plan to build a colony of perfect people under water, while he destroys the rest of the Earth. Le Chiffre makes money by providing banking services for terrorists and rebels. Without him, their money will be more restricted, causing them problems. And Le Chiffre recognizes the dangerous sort of person he is dealing with, which is why he sets up the game in the first place. He needs to restore the $101 million of his client's money he lost. When things don't go exactly as planned, he becomes even more determined to keep his clients happy and things take an unpleasant turn for Bond. This leads to a slightly surprising scene in a Bond film, surprising because it is more in line with the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />Some people may be a little put off by the last hour, as it is very relationship heavy, but this made the film all the better for me. How refreshing to see such a thing in a James Bond film. In recent entries, the relationships have been relegated to the villain and their connection to the story, with a woman along for the ride. The one exception to this would be Michelle Yeoh in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", who proved to be the equal of Bond. In \\"Casino Royale\\", we learn about Bond's induction into this line of work, some of his relationship with his boss, M, and a relationship that will prove very significant in his life. The only more significant relationship depicted in the films has been his relationship with his wife, in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", and that doesn't last long.<br /><br />\\"Casino\\" Royale\\" is a very good, almost great entry in the series. But it is too long. Most Bond films are over two hours; too much story to go with the requisite action scenes for the films to be short. And at almost 2 and a half hours, \\"Casino Royale\\" contains the requisite story and action scenes, but it feels long. I think this is because the action scenes are almost entirely in the first hour. Campbell tries to interject some action throughout; after the first session of the poker game, there is a well staged fight in the stairwell of the hotel andat one point, Bond has another kind of fight for his life. But these are brief moments. When you compare them to the two action sequences earlier in the film, they appear all the more brief.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is the first Bond book written by Fleming, but this is not the first time it was filmed. In the late 60s, a big budget, big star filled comedy using the same title, was made. Well, it is a disaster. Many directors were brought in to try to save the project, and keep the budget under control. That didn't happen. In the end, each director is credited with a specific part of the film. John Huston, one of the directors, makes a cameo as the head of the British Secret Service. They soon meet Sir James Bond (David Niven). Later, James Bond (Peter Sellers) and little Jamie Bond (Woody Allen) make appearances; it seems the British Secret Service wants to keep the name alive, so they licensed not only the double o status, but the name as well, when the original Bond (Niven) decided he was going to retire. William Holden, Sophia Loren, Orson Welles and more have cameos. Yes, the film is as big a mess as it sounds.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is certainly the best Bond film since \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" and maybe even earlier.

Many directors were brought in to try to save the project, and keep the budget under control. That didn't happen. In the end, each director is credited with a specific part of the film. John Huston, one of the directors, makes a cameo as the head of the British Secret Service. They soon meet Sir James Bond (David Niven). Later, James Bond (Peter Sellers) and little Jamie Bond (Woody Allen) make appearances; it seems the British Secret Service wants to keep the name alive, so they licensed not only the double o status, but the name as well, when the original Bond (Niven) decided he was going to retire. William Holden, Sophia Loren, Orson Welles and more have cameos. Yes, the film is as big a mess as it sounds.  <br /> <br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is certainly the best Bond film since \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" and maybe even earlier. I only hope the filmmakers will continue to use Craig's abilities in the best way to enhance the character and the franchise for future Bond films.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is one of the best films ever made and Fox has recently released a fitting two disc DVD edition of the film. Fitting because the DVD is one of the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />Directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the God of screenwriters, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross. How could a film with this pedigree be anything but good?<br /><br />What you may not realize, or know, is that this film made Robert Redford the star he is today. Paul Newman, already an established star having appeared in \\"Hud\\", \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" and \\"The Hustler\\", among others, was a bankable star and the film was made because he agreed to make it. Initially, he wanted to play the Sundance Kid, but eventually settled on the role of Cassidy. Robert Redford was not new to film, but he was nowhere near the icon he would become. He had some early success which was followed by a few clunkers. The pair became a match made in heaven and would go on to appear in more films together. On screen, they appear to be friends, much like their characters, and this adds to the charm of their relationship.<br /><br />Redford clearly recognizes the influence this film had on his career. His famous film academy and film festival are named after his character in the film.<br /><br />Butch and Sundance decide to rob the mail car of a train owned by a powerful rail baron. Butch is tired of the work and wants to retire, but he needs one or two big scores to set him up. After blowing up the rail car, they run off with the loot and hide out in a small town, at a brothel they frequent. Meeting up with the rest of their gang, they quell a revolt and decide to do one more job. They will rob the same mail car on the same railway, on its next run through the area. It is the perfect crime, no one would suspect the same train being robbed, so it will probably be loaded with money. After blowing up the car for a second time, they notice another locomotive speeding towards them and a crew of men on horseback alight from the car and give chase, chasing Butch and Sundance, and their two accomplices, for days, across many terrains. Finally, they realize the rail baron has hired a famous Indian tracker to help a band of men, including a former sheriff who is now a famous bounty hunter, catch the duo. After the chase, they return to the home of Ella (Katharine Ross), the Sundance Kid's girlfriend. Tired, they decide to leave the country and travel to Bolivia and begin robbing banks there.<br /><br />As I watched this DVD of \\"Butch Cassidy\\", two things quickly became apparent. This film is virtually timeless. With the lone exception of the song \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\", the film could've been made yesterday, the images are so clear. The second is that the DVD print is one of the most beautiful transfers I have ever watched. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (who would later work on \\"American Beauty\\" among others) is simply stunning and brings out all of the rich detail of the landscape. Everything is crisp and clear, when it is supposed to be, colors are bright and vivid, it's just beautiful to watch. It doesn't hurt that the stars are two of the most handsome men to ever appear in film, at the prime of their careers, and one of the most beautiful women to ever co-star. How did anyone get past all of that eye candy?<br /><br />The key to becoming fully invested in this film is William Goldman's screenplay. He introduces the characters in action, we learn as we go, and they are almost always moving, or doing something. Goldman fills their mouths with witty dialogue, showing us how their relationship works, and they are instantly likeable to us. This is basically a love triangle with Ross' Ella playing the go-between. The two men have a very close friendship, enjoying each other's company. But Cassidy loves Ella as well, even appears slightly jealous until he realizeshis friend is the recipient of this woman's love, so they get along. Then, there is the famous chase. The railway baron's men chase Butch and Sundance for days, taking up a significant chunk of the film. But this scene proves to us how committed the two men are to each other and makes their future trek to Bolivia all the more believable. We have to believe there is a real threat and these men never let up on the chase, if they catch Butch and Sundance, they will be killed. As soon as they reach Bolivia, Goldman has a lot of fun with the characters again, exploring their relationships, rebuilding them in a way, and making them light hearted again. It is almost amazing to watch this film because if a studio executive were presented with the same screenplay today, it would probably not be made. It doesn't hit plot points at pre-determined pages, it tells an unconventional story, and we never actually see the villains. Goldman had the luxury of writing this film during a period in which studios were still able to work with somewhat unconventional screenplays. Of course, they wanted to make money as well, but they still considered film an art form.<br /><br />George Roy Hill is an underappreciated director. I think a large part of this is because many of his films are very humorous. Comedy is not as highly respected in Hollywood as drama, even though making a good comedy is much more difficult. So I suspect the humorous elements of most of his films made him less respected in Hollywood, but when your films are as good as \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" and \\"The Sting\\", you deserve some respect. He made his share of duds, but when he passed away a few years ago, Hollywood was robbed of a talent ready to make at least a few more classics.<br /><br />During this period, big screen Westerns were becoming unpopular. Perhaps the dearth of television westerns was keeping the public out of the theaters, but this genre was considered risky at the time. Recent films starring Burt Lancaster and others were failing to light the box office fire. The second disc contains a new \\"Making of\\" feature including interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, former studio executives David Brown and Richard Zanuck and more. Zanuck reveals that he took a real chance in greenlighting this film, but fought for it all the way. He also haggled with Hill and the filmmakers, in an attempt to keep the budget under control; he became concerned when the film was projected to cost about $7.5 million (consider the average studio film now costs at least $125 million). But the film would go on to be a big hit. Such a huge hit the filmmakers followed this with the equally popular \\"The Sting\\".<br /><br />The second DVD also contains some archival interviews with the stars, some trailers and more.<br /><br />In the \\"Making Of\\" documentary, they discuss the inclusion of the song \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\". People fought against it but Hill and composer Burt Bacharach felt it would be the perfect accompaniment to the scene of Butch and Ella riding a new-fangled bike through her barn yard. It does work, but it is clearly not a fit for the period depicted in the film, and is the most dated element within the film today. It just seems silly today.<br /><br />\\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is a superlative example of the treatment all classics should receive on DVD.

B000HA4WT8|5.0|First I want to mention that I spent 13 years in Tokyo, Japan and I know every detail about this place. I cannot believe that the director Justin Lin has never been to Japan before (as he said in the interview) while was able to pull off such a accurate depiction of the distinctive characteristic of Tokyo. Of course there are exaggerations; no movie can be exciting without it. It is the direction of exaggeration that matters, which is suprisingly accurate in this movie. As opposed to what another review here argues, it is not unrealistic to live in \\"rabbit hutch\\" while work in a garage for fixing cars, I have seen similar garage in downtown Tokyo. I have also seen American kids wearing uniform and go to japanese high schools; there are many US military bases near Tokyo. The rivalry between right wing yakuza and Korean descendents (Han) is also a deeply rooted part of Japanese society. The use of famous Japanese TV personalities in this movie deserves an applause.   However, it IS ridiculous to have capsule hotel in Han's garage and so on.     Having moved to US after graduating from college in Japan, I enjoyed this movie because it gave me a fresh look back at where I spent my insecure adolescent years. It would be an exciting experience to explore Tokyo once having estabilished self confidence as Sean did (provided you have a source of income, of course)
0316172324|5.0|The book is an easy read and full of wonderful stories and vignettes that illustrate Malcolm's points. Essentially the book is about how people make rapid decisions, often before consciously processing the available data, and the good and bad consequences of this. We are all familiar with some of the negative consequences - racial stereotyping for instance - but Malcolm discuses some of the positive ways this impacts effective decision-making. Using a relatively small case of characters and some richly described stories he leads us through an understanding of how rapid cognition works, why it is different from how we analyze things and how it can be more or less effective that any approaches to problem solving.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the stores about people who had trained their snap judgments so that they could make quick and accurate assessments of situations while not being distracted by misplaced reactions and those about how hard it can be to describe a reaction, even if it is a good one.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in how people make decisions.
038533348X|5.0|I am of the opinion (so far) that Cat's Cradle is one of Kurt Vonnegut's best books, if not the best book he has ever written.  It was the first book I ever read by him and certainly was not the last.   <br /> <br />Cat's Cradle spans a tail narrated by a Scientist in search of what is at first only a biography of the man who created the atom bomb.  This simple endeavor quickly escalates into a world ending climax.  As the story grows closer and closer toward it's end, it becomes more clear of what exactly will happen...although this is never totally revealed.   <br /> <br />The book provides a lesson about humanity's inevitable fate of self-destruction and self-doubt.  There also lies a message about religion's role in all of this.
1401302378|5.0|Chris Anderson does a nice job of introducing some key concepts that are redefining business in the Internet era. As he says \\"The era of one-size-fits-all is ending, and in its place is something new, a market of multitudes\\". In this world the ability of the Internet to give customers access to a vast (and rapidly growing) array of choices is changing not just how they buy but what they buy. The book has some solid research on how companies, both pure Internet retailers and mixed offline/online retailers are adapting to this world. The book discusses everything from Sturgeon's Law (\\"ninety percent of everything is crud\\") to the \\"98 percent rule\\" (98% of anything sold online will have at least occasional sales even if the online catalog is 40 times the offline one).<br /><br />The book covers how hits have dominated in the past century and how niches will dominate in this one. It also gives some general suggestions as to what you can do about it although it does somewhat leave you hanging in terms of specific advice for how to do marketing, build information systems etc in this brave new world.<br /><br />Thought provoking and compelling.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|\\"that is why it is called Babel because The Lord confused the speech of the whole world\\".. (Gen 11:9 NAB).I LOVED this movie. I went to see it because Im a big fan of Brad Pitt's but the movie is brilliant!The way its put together and the way it is so intense is so artisic and briliant!I don't think I've ever seen a movie quite like this before.The movie all revolves around people of different races and speech (as why the title about Babel in the Old Testament where God scattered the language of everyone in the world).....and the gun used to shoot Brad Pitt's character's wife in the film.The movie shuffles various characters revolving around the gun that shot Brad Pitt's character's wife in the film.There is the kids who shot her, Brad's character's children and their nanny, the deaf mute girl whose father originally owned the gun, and then Brad Pitt's character & his wife. The story is told in different time levels like the scene with Brad Pitt's character's babysitter is ahead of the scenes with Brad's characrer & his character's wife.So are the other scenes in the movie....but it all falls together beautifully and it always keeps you wondering what would happen next.  Good film...though not for everyone I LOVED it and thought it was true art and Brad did some of his best ever acting too.  If you like wonderfully crafted art movies check it out!!

B0000029GA|5.0|I remember it like it was yesterday. About 14 years ago i was watching a show called video music box.(all nyc hip hop heads know it well) The host did something he doesn't normally do. He devoted an entire show to showcase some queens bred new comer by the name of Nasty Nas. I had no idea who this dude was, but from the way everyone was raving about him, i had the hunch that something special was about to happen. <br />      Hip hop legends like Mc search, Pete Rock, Large professor, & Dj Premier spoke in great detail about the incredible experience it was to be a part of what they had already helmed a hip hop classic. Dj premier even went as far as to say that he would've done pro bono if need be. Just from the interview Nasty Nas gave w/ host Ralph Mcdaniels, i could see that this was no ordinary street kid turned rapper. The hour long special ended with a little video called \\"it ain't hard to tell\\". Not only was i thrilled with the \\"Human Nature\\" sample (me being a huge mj fan @ the time), but the superb lyricism that this kid was spitting blew my little 11 year old mind. <br />       Soon after watching that special, i came across the now famous 5 mic review in The Source magazine. For you young bucks that don't know, @ that time, The Source was hip hop gospel (as oppose to the debacle that Mr. benzino turned it into). I knew at this time that i had to beg my dad to buy me this album. From begining to end it is literally the greatest music i've ever heard. Here is my breakdown of this classic. <br /> <br />1.\\"The Genesis\\"- a simple yet unforgettable explanation of Nas' plan to make it <br /> <br />2. \\"Ny state of mind\\" -  nas illustrates a dream he had of being a ny gangsta over premiers gritty yet beatiful piano backdrop. <br /> <br />3.\\"Life's a bitch\\"- nas delivers arguably his best verse ever that reflects on the blessings of life & the hardships one must experience to come up in the hood. this was also the introduction of a then unsigned street poet by the name of A.z. <br /> <br />4. \\"The world is yours\\"- Pete Rock delivers his darkest production while Nas gives his thesis on The famous Tony montana slogan.  <br /> <br />5. \\"Halftime\\"- this was his freestlye/battle track. Simple yet thought provoking spitting on a straight up hardcore ny boom bap track courtesy of large pro. <br /> <br />6. \\"memory lane\\" - just reminicing about old times over a soulful blues backdrop. <br /> <br />7. \\" One love\\" - just to think, by mentioning his incarcerated homie Cormega's name on this tribute to those locked behind the \\"g\\" wall, Mega had a record deal waiting for him when he came home. Also cant 4 get the smooth xzylophone sample courtesy of queens legend Q-tip(who also laces the old school \\"one love\\" chant). <br /> <br />8. \\"one time 4 your mind\\"- just another straight spittin' joint in the vein of \\"halftime\\" <br /> <br />9. \\"Represent\\" - this was his get u hype thug anthem, with another classic preemo beat. <br /> <br />10. \\" it ain't hard to tell\\"- this was the 1st single and the one that made me cop the album. large professor samples micheal jackson, & nas delivers potent street poetry. <br /> <br />         About 14 years later, Nas is still hip hop royalty, but no album in the years that followed it has ever made the impact on mine & millions of other true hip hop fans lives that \\"illmatic\\" has. Many artists, including himself, have attempted to capture the poetry & pure genius that this album did, but there will only be one illmatic. This is and always will be hip hops holy grail.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|Hard to believe it was nearly 20 years ago, but it is great to see \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" finally being given the attention it deserves.  This was Cleese and Palin at their best, with fine performances from Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis, in this hilarious romp.  Kline is a veritable chameleon, able to turn in unique performances in one movie after another, but he never played someone quite like Otto.  He and Palin had so many memorable moments together, not least of all the closing scene.  This movie will leave you in stitches.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|As the previous review stated, this is poor manufacturing. I just recieved my set today, and EVERY disc in the entire collection, with the exception of the hidden disc, had lots of scratches on it. If you're going to pay over 130 dollars for an item, it had better be in very good condition. It's obvious it was a rush job when they were designing the sleeves which hold the discs. What do they expect when you slide discs in like that? It won't get scratched at all? Please. Despite all that, I still love this show and the Rambaldi Box design.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This disc is amazing - as soon as Because opened up the soundscape with the insects, birds, an ambient sounds providing the background for the ephemeral, transcendent, harmonic voices of the four boys, the tears began to flow. These are the voices of our life story people.  And this is the soundtrack of our lives.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the old sci fi film Soylent Green (an overly polluted, resource depleted world leads to chaos, totalitarianism, and the mysterious edible of the title that feeds the starving masses) remembers the final scene.  The great actor Edgar G. Robinson, tied of it all, goes to a euthanasia center to be put to sleep while viewing a 350 degree movie panorama of images showing the world the way it used to be.  Mountains. Vistas, Nature. All the while, while listening to Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.<br /><br />I thought of this while listening to LOVE, becuase I realized, when my time comes - and I hope thats not for a long time - this is the disc I would like to hear as I fade from this life. The complete songs, the snippets, the segues, the voices, the song tags (hey-la hay-a-la-lo-wa), the Sullivan intro, the mental image of The Beatles singing I want to Hold Your Hand (Paul cocking his head, eyebrows raised, John bouncing, grinning  to the camera, Ringo joyously bobbing his head, huge grin, George, well, giving that George look).<br /><br />So many, many memories. Where I was when this records originally came out. The covers. Mimicing the Beatles. This disc is free association of a lifetime worth of memories.<br /><br />Listening to these songs anew, for the umpteenth time, also makes one re-evaluate the players and their contributions. First, it simply must be acknowledged that George Martin was an integral part of making The Beatles who theywere. Martin brought out the full potential of this group.  Each record had a unique sound, a uniquely identifiable property.  And while Lennon may have felt that MArtin was better suited to McCartney's musical temperements and never truly captured the muscial soundscapes travelling through his head, Martin did a magnificent job.<br /><br />For while McCartney's tunes remain timeless, it is Lennon's musical vision and voice that propels this set. Each song - Lucy In The Sky (introductory notes reimagined as dropping  individual diamonds from the sky), A Day In The Life, Strawberry Fields, I Am The Walrus, and of course All You Need Is Love - emerge not merely as classic pop songs, but as epochal musical statements that forever changed music.<br /><br />It is perhaps Walrus that most benefits from this remastering. Virtually unchanged, though slightly shortened from the released version, this is the first truely, magnificent stereo mix of the song. The result - especially in 5.1 sound - is astonishing. Lennon's voice is front and center as the seperate strings/sound surround you from all four corners. I have heard this song in my \\"mind's ear\\" for decades in this fashion - truly hearing it pristine, clear, fresh, opened up - virtually live - is nothing short of revelatory.<br /><br />The same can be said for While My Guitar Gently Weeps - yes, it's the Anthology version, but a stunningly delicate thing of beauty it is. With the addition of Martin's final Beatle score, I dare you to listen to it without mourning the loss of George Harrison and our youth.  I dare you not to shed a tear.<br /><br />I could go on and on.  It is possible to criticize some elements of the production.  It is not really a mash - too many of the songs are virtually unchanged - but let's remember that this disc is the soundtrack to a live production.  Presumably, those who spends the hundres of dollars to view Cirque de Soleil's show wouldn't  be content hearing 90 minutes of non-continuity cut and paste.<br /><br />LOVE is an extraordinary achievement.  A rare blending of artistic integrity and shrewd business acument, it succeeds beyond all expectation. Lennon probably would havehated, but then again he never liked side 2 of Abbey Road either.  Then again, he only listened to it when there was such a thing as Side 2.  Thankfully, Lennon gets the last word on the disc too. When Johnny Rhythm says goodbye at the end its more than the end of the disc.  It's the end to our life's soundtrack.probably would have hated, but then again he never liked side 2 of Abbey Road either.  Then again, he only listened to it when there was such a thing as Side 2.

0375703764|1.0|Danielewski is a little like \\"musician\\" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. \\"House of Leaves\\" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.<br /><br />If having to turn a book while you read seems \\"cutting edge\\" or \\"daring\\" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer or China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures marks a significant time in the history of Rush. Following 1980's Permanet Waves, which is kind of like a prequel, Rush came full circle by eliminating the sonic grooves they had worked into their progressive rock sound while shifting their focus to playing rock music with a much harder edge. Moving Pictures is symbolic as it reflects a redefining period when progressive rock groups were playing harder and heavier again and just before synthesizers would forever change how the music sounded. This album could also easily pass for a greatest hits collection as some of the best classics are here, plus there's \\"Camera Eye,\\" the band's last ever epic song. Moving Pictures lies right in the middle of the band's progression and helped catapult their popularity to the masses, but the songs remain inviting, insightful, and truly timeless even 26 years after it's release. They may be older now, but when you define them by their craft they remain ageless.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|A few other people said it; one word describes it,  the DVD version - MINDBLOWING! <br /> <br />Beatles - incredible music <br />George Martin - Incredible engineering. <br /> <br />Hearing it again in this format brought tears to my eyes.

0393317552|4.0|I know this is supposed to be a review, which would require that I had already finished the book, but I couldn't think of anywhere else I might be able to ask a question of people who have already read it.  I, just this moment, had to put this book down in disgust after reading only the prologue.  I've seen this book quoted in so many books I had to see what it was all about.  Allow me to explain my near instant disappointment.  In the Yali's question portion of the prologue Diamond claims to \\"turn on its head the usual racist assumption that the ability of \\"white immigrants to Australia [to build] a literate, industrialized, politically centralized, democratic state\\" was due to their intellectual superiority.  I would have no trouble hearing an argument that stated this was indeed racist and was indeed false but Diamond's argument is so poor I literally had to close the book and take a deep breath in my disgust at the fact that this was Pulitzer material.  He argues, as the second of only two reasons offered, that the people of New Guinea, with whom he's worked for 33 years apparently, are smarter than Westerners because of the MODERN passive entertainment such as \\"television, radio, and movies\\" enjoyed and indulged in \\"for seven hours per day\\" by most western children.  He says \\"in contrast, traditional New Guinea children have virtually no such opportunities for passive entertainment and instead spend almost all of their waking hours actively doing something, such as talking or playing with other children or adults.\\"  He then sites the obvious multitude of studies on the \\"irreversible mental stunting associated with reduced childhood stimulation... [which] ...surely contributes a non-genetic component to the superior average mental function displayed by New Guineans.  This all sat well with me right up until the moment when dear dumb Diamond said that this \\"childhood developmental factor was likely to distinguish not only New Guineans from Westerners, but also hunter-gatherers and other members of technologically primitive societies from members of technologically advanced societies in general.  This was the point on which he, the Pulitzer prize winner, rested his assertion of having put on its head the usual racist assumptions of superior western intelligence.  He admits the developmental disadvantage to be during \\"modern times\\" but doesn't define modern times, nor does he propose the modern times disadvantage in any weaker light than the genetics suggestions made.   You don't have to be able to spell Pulitzer to know how grossly flawed this logic is and it is making it very hard for me to continue in the book.  Let me explain just in case it hasn't grabbed you yet.  This guy just said TV and radio and movies stunted the intellectual ability of western children, which made them less intelligent than New Guineans and then implied that somehow this very modern day possibility might have had something to do with hunter-gatherer societies being overthrown by western civilizations hundreds of years before TV and radio and movies existed.  New Guineans very well may be more intelligent than westerners today.  This bares zero weight in the establishment of how westerners came to conquer and out develop hunter-gatherer societies before these things were ever developed.  Much more time would have to have been spent here expounding upon notions of early toys and individualized pastimes prior to colonization and expansion of western societies to allow such a point to bear any weight at this point in the book.  If the is the prologue where utmost attention is paid to capturing the reader's attention and laying the groundwork for the massive undertaking to follow, I am sincerely nervous about wasting another moment of my precious time on this author.  The fact that it won such a prestigious prize means little to me at this point.  I'm looking for people who've read it to reassure me that it will indeed be a worthwhile read.  I'm an average \\"western and less intelligent than a New Guinean\\" white boy who studied English at a second rate school in PA. I can't possibly be the first person this occurred to upon reading this book.  This kind of nonsense coming from a man of Diamonds stature is painful evidence of just how far we're willing to go to turn this racist notion \\"on its head\\" these days.  The question that will decide whether I continue to read is whether he did it intentionally, or didn't even know he was doing it.  Both possibilities are very upsetting to me.  4 stars for now, only because I haven't finished it and therefore don't deserve to change the average.

B000J4QWMC|5.0|Most of the reviewers of this movie have completely missed the point.  If you go into it thinking you are going to see an over the top version of the show you watched growing up, you will be disappointed.  If you take it for what it is, Michael Mann's updated vision of the show he created with no rules or censorship, you are in for a great ride.  I found most reviews of this movie very irritating because they all compared it to the tv show.  No one was willing to open up to something different.  It is not the 80's anymore.  The movie is set it present times.  The Rolling Stone review nailed the point of the movie exactly (the only accurate review in my opinion).  Mann's directing and use of HD cinematography are top notch and submerse you into a world of undercover narcotic cops.  This isn't Bad Boys (even though I loved that film) and Michael Mann isn't Michael Bay.  I agree with the other reviewer who stated that this film is not for the nascar group.  There is so much going on that is does need multiple viewings to fully appreciate.  If you pay attention and fully get the movie, you will agree that it is a awsome ride.  The movie's climax alone was worth the price of admission.
B000H5U832|5.0|I never thought I'd see an animated film as good as Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but this one steals my heart!  The CGI is simply mind-blowing--I don't think I've seen better.  A must see for kids, the man of the house and even the ladies.  How is it that PIXAR is able to keep churning out such wonderful flicks?
B000H5V8DG|5.0|You know about the show, but here's about this particular set with the artifact box.  The box is just too cool!  It opens in a \\"Rambaldi\\" fashion, with a secret compartment at the bottom.  It's not just another DVD case!  It's something you can leave on your coffee table as a real eye-catching conversation starter.  If you like the series, go ahead and splurg a little to get the entire set in this box.  It's a very good deal price-wise for the DVDs, and you'll feel like you have a Rambaldi artifact of your own.  (The picture here doesn't do it justice!  You have to see it for real.  Velour lining and a little book with comments about the series from the actors, creator, directors, writers, etc.)    It is a limited edition (well, okay, so it's a limited edition of 40,000, but still a limited edition).  Any Alias fan would love this for Christmas!    **Note**  Yes, I too have scratched discs in my set (mostly only season 4).  :o(  Most of the reviews are about the actual show (which is great!), and, while the box is really impressive, the issue with the scratches on the discs shouldn't be missed.  So, if you purchased this as a Christmas present, check out the discs so there is not a disappointed Alias fan out there on December 25.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Absolutely awesome. 100% natural. Organic music.  <br />The quest for home, the search for God and the cry for Father are archetypal themes that support the work of Tom Waits. Overcoming the influence of youthful anger, Waits never lost his angst. The chaos in him has always given birth to singing stars. One of the weeping ballads you will find on disc three has these lyrics: \\"He's an old altar boy lieing there in the streets..that's why I'm feelin' so blue. I'm an altar boy. I can order in Latin..I never got the rest...just the ritual...now I'm habitual...\\"...this song, one among several dozen God-thirsty songs (Georgia Lee,  Make it Rain, God's Away on Business, Time, House Where Nobody Lives, Tom Traubert's Blues, Burma Shave, On the Nickel, Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet, Chocolate Jesus, Jesus Gonna Be Here Soon) is a new song here, but essential to the body of Wait's work.  <br />Tom once said in an interview: \\"Folks from broken homes like broken things....they want to fix them.\\"  His stunning \\"Christmas Card from a Hooker\\" stands beside Simon and Garfunkels famous Silent Night, Waits representing the individual while Simon and Garfunkel express pain for the world.  <br />This 3 cd set only confirms Waits place as prophet of pain to this generation. He expresses the colossal failure of religious institutions to connect man to his destiny. Any who listen to the rest of the story embedded in this collection will understand that Wait's has consistently been an advocate for struggling souls.  <br />If I had the money, I would give this set as a gift to every seminarian who graduates in 2006. To souls in captivity, this is a musical twin to Martin Luther King Jr's \\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\\" We can just be thankful nobody every assasinated this prophet.  <br />Thank you Tom. Hold on to Kathleen. Good night.  <br />The entire set is a masterpiece. Every cd is full of surprises, put together seamlessly, and will make you laugh, smile, frown and weep. <br /> <br />Tragically, the CD in Atlanta stores is \\"behind the counter\\" this Christmas because of the price (folks were stealing it); had it been packaged in a larger sleeve, it would have commanded shelf space, been seen on display with the other new releases. This was poor marketing. <br />I wanted Waits to be on top of the charts the whole week. <br />
B000GRUS22|3.0|I was bitterly disappointed by the 5th release of Enigma 'Voyageur' that was released a few years back. I vowed to never listen to that album again after the 3rd try. I am a fan and lover of the first 4 albums and enjoyed Cretu's success and creativity of blending ethno-fusion, chants and native indian sounds and voices together into a wonderful concoction of world beats that could take you away from this reality to another dimension all together. I value Michel Cretu as a artist and creator and producer. He is talented and super wonderful mixing music together within his Enigma project and solo career.<br /><br />So it was with bated breath and low expectations that I purchased this album not knowing what to expect and hoping that Cretu had heeded the majority of Enigma's fans' requests and pleadings. It is now my 4th listen to this album 'A Posteriori' and I am left with each listen that much more saddened and disappointed. I can state that this album is a much better sounding piece than 'Voyageur' was. I honestly feel the old Enigma sound is lost as Cretu continues to bring new sounds to his Enigma project. What this album lacked was the hauntingly seductive voice of his wife Sandra. Only 3 songs had lyrics and these were sung by Cretu himself.<br /><br />I will continue to listen to the earlier Enigma, this album is okay, nothing special to write home about. 'Epper Si Muove' and 'Goodbye Milky Way' were my favourite songs as they showed glimpses and I mean mere glimpses of the Enigma we came to know and love. In the first song we momentarily heard the well know trumpets of Enigma. That brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />Like several other reviewers have stated and I agree with them. It is time that Cretu puts Enigma to rest. Let us remember the 4 good albums of Enigma. There is no more need for Cretu to release new Enigma if each release will get worser than the last.<br /><br />Overall this is a listenable album but I was disappointed. It is a album I will play rarely.lbum I will play rarely.
6304712499|2.0|If you watched the original animated series on HBO back in the day, then saw this you'd know what I mean.  They just didn't do the movie right.  Way too tame.  And yes, I understand that cleaning things up so the kiddies can watch too means more money, but the original Spawn comics and animated series were DRASTICALLY more adult than the movie was, and as such, I was bored.<br /><br />Not bad by any means, but they just didn't do it right.

B000IJ79V6|5.0|Widely regarded as one of the best superhero sequels ever, director Richard Lester's 'Superman II' had the daunting task of living up to the legacy of the original film, despite having major restrictions placed on it.  For instance, Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were not available for additional scenes, thus much of the film had to be re-cut and Brando had to be removed entirely for legal reasons.  Lester had to incorporate footage shot by original director Richard Donner with newly shot scenes, while keeping the tone of the sequel consistent.  The end result is a sequel that's almost every bit as good as the film that spawned it.  [[ASIN:B000VS6LYA Christopher Reeve]] even said that this was his favorite of the Superman movies.<br /><br />In recent years, the revelation of all the behind-the-scenes drama of Donner's dismissal from the franchise has unfairly placed Lester's version in a negative light.  Some fans even went as far as to state that the new [[ASIN:B000IJ79WU Superman II-The Richard Donner Cut]] was the definitive sequel before even having seen it!  While which 'Superman II' is superior remains subjective, the simple fact is that the Donner Cut is a close approximation of his original vision rather than a fully realized film, since he had only shot around 70% of the footage.  The rest was spliced together from screen tests, new shots using body and voice doubles, and footage from Lester's version.  This is not unlike what Richard Lester had to do to finish his sequel.  Thus, both films can and must co-exist since there are shared footage and scenes unique to each version that simply work better.  For instance, terrorists hijacking the Eiffel Tower is simply more of a job for Superman than Lois jumping out a window.  Consequently, Donner's Brando footage better illustrates the father/son motif established in the first film than Lester's re-shoots with Superman's mother.<br /><br />As for the extras in this re-release, WB has compiled an impressive array of rarely seen material.  There is a commentary by the producers, a 1981 'making of' special hosted by Chris Reeve, 8 Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons plus a retrospective, deleted scenes, and perhaps the most eclectic...the 'Superman 50th Anniversary' TV Special.  Produced in 1988 by the 'Saturday Night Live' crew, this special was widely panned originally but had since become a hot commodity on the bootlegging scene.  With appearances by classic Superman and SNL alumni, this special can be better appreciated now in hindsight for its quirky blend of comedy and nostalgia.<br /><br />In closing, despite its shortcomings, 'Superman II' set forth a benchmark in the superhero film genre by showing how a sequel can take off the \\"kid gloves\\" and come out swinging once the exposition is firmly established in the original.  Knowledge of the off-set controversy should only enhance our appreciation of the final film the cast and crew put together because it really is a classic sequel.en material.

B000JJRIO8|2.0|As a faithful listener to 2pac's music, I am disappointed with the result and the quality of this album.  We can understand that any posthumous album released can never be as close to what 2pac had envisioned, we can understand that Afeni Shakur as a mother is doing everything she can to keep her son's legacy alive, and we can definitely understand that most of 2pac's fans are at consensus concerning the illegitimacy of the 2 most recent albums. <br /> <br />The illegitimacy of the album is this: the inconsistent rappers, the \\"recycled\\" material of his voice, and the re-work of 2pac's ghetto love songs.   <br /> <br />I hate to be the devil's advocate; however, I agree overall with most of the Pac's life comments.  As a personal thought, because it is Pac's last album (with a grain of salt), I support it.  I will go to the store, buy it for the sake of supporting the TASF of the Arts.  I will listen to it just so I can hear this great man's message of truth and ambition... <br /> <br />In the end, I rate this album a \\"2\\" for the production of the music, but NOT for the man behind the music, which is 2pac.   <br /> <br />\\"Stay up Pac, your fans are still down for yah.\\" <br /> <br />

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This has to be one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard. <br />The Beatles have been reinvented, and someone listening to the Beatles for the first time ever or for longtime fans will talk about this album for decades. <br />I am also one who would like to see the entire Beatles library redone by the Martins. <br />YOU MUST GET THIS CD. I also want to go to Las Vegas to see the show!
B00005MP58|5.0|The A&E/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice staring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is by far the best ever. The scenery, attention to detail and overall production is amazing.<br /><br />I owned the Special Edition and was given 10th Anniversary Limited Edition Collector's Set as a gift by someone who knew my opinion of this movie.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|-------the entire Beatles back catalogue could get the DTS 5.1 treatment. I don't mean that they should get the treatment that this album has, but the job the Martin's have done is exemplary, for both the concept of \\"Love\\" and the technical expertise they have displayed in getting the 5.1 DVD together. <br /> <br />Oh for Rubber Soul, Abbey Road and the White Album like this.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|It is no new revelation that Dylan has always been a musical chameleon, leaving his listeners to wonder who he really is. Listening to this album, I could not help feeling that Bob is  singing for the shear joy of it. A joyful Dylan seems a little like an oxymoron, but hear me out !  <br /> <br />But first let me say that the musicians on \\"Modern Times\\" are whip crack sharp, and are worth the price for admission in their own right. The drummer on \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\", does things on the drums I haven't heard in a real long time. <br /> <br />Always the wordsmith and poet with an amplifier, Dylans' lyrics on this album conjure up a litany of images of an old man's musings, dreams, longings and regrets,and yes loneliness. However, he seems to rise above being swallowed up in self pity. There is a sense of triumph hovering between the lyrics, however creaky and dusty it may seem. \\"Working Man's Blues\\" bubbles up to the top,with all the trademark rumbling licks found in such songs as \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", but without the thin whiney seething and darkness.  <br /> <br />You come away sensing that here is the beautiful side of growing old....freedom to be oneself, without having now to open up every door, and no longer having to walk down every road. <br /> <br />
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I do think that Ms. McKennitt has a magnificent voice and on its own this would be a magnificent album.  But it does fall just short when comparing it to her previous works.  The entire album has a slightly overcast disposition, missing a lighter happier piece.  I certainly appreciate the distinctly eastern slant of this (and some previous) work as well as the rich musicality--did I mention her voice, that voice.  But I was somewhat disturbed by the adoption in \\"Beneath a Phyrgian Sky\\" of a thematic riff that came straight from \\"The Bonny Swans\\" (from The Mask and The Mirror).  My favorite McKennitt albums remain \\"Elemental\\" (\\"Stolen Child\\" is amazing) and \\"Parallel Dreams\\".
B000I2IT44|3.0|As a major Porcupine Tree fan, I looked forward to this one with great anticipation. Besides the usual CDs, I have some of their live music, bought and downloaded from their web site, and it's fabulous. I thought seeing it performed would take it to the next level.<br /><br />{Sigh} I didn't even get all the way through the disk. The music is as great as I expected, but the editing and special effects are jarring and distracting. No musician gets a long enough stretch to actually see them play anything before it's a quick cut and off to something else. Every fourth or fifth cut uses a grainy, faux-fifties black and white look that adds nothing to the performance and just gets in the way.<br /><br />I didn't want MTV. I wanted a concert. And I didn't get it. I don't expect just a camera mounted at the back of the auditorium, but I do expect the video editing and production to enhance the experience instead of detracting from it. Not so on this one. I found it more enjoyable with my eyes closed.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|I'm surprised to see that no one else has written about this collector's edition DVD package because it's so cool that it needs to be spoken about in some form or other. It comes in a metal box which is exactly the same dimensions as the box that the HBO series \\"Band of Brothers\\" came in. There's that which is already pretty nice but inside is where you find the real treasure. The film comes in a three disc set, each one in an individual slipcase with one of the three main characters in the film on the cover. The presentationof the film is on par with, if not above the quality of the previous Tartan video release in terms of picture and sound. This set has a 6.1 DTS mix which is nice, clear and loud. The picture is very nice as it should be, since this film is beautifully shot. There are plenty of bonus features like commentary and featurettes but the third disc has the best supplementary feature which is a production diary from the entire shoot. I think this is one of the shining examples of a behind the scenes documentary done right as it really shows you what goes in to making a film and how much hard work it can be. It's lengthy, it's detailed and thankfully, it has English subtitles because I don't speak a lick of Korean. Just for this documentary alone, this set is worth picking up.<br /><br />Finally, you get not only a 35mm film strip encased in a nice cardboard sleeve, you get a miniaturized graphic novel of the original similarly titled Japanese Manga that the film was based off of. If you've seen the special edition of Sin City that came with the Hard Goodbye graphic novel, it's just like that except its printed in reverse and you have to read it from back cover to front like you would with an actual Japanese book! (Don't worry, the language is in English so you can still read it)<br /><br />This is easily one of the best recommendations I can make. If you love the movie, this is a no-brainer. If you know someone else who loves this movie, this would make a great gift. Either way, this is one of the coolest all around DVD packages I've ever picked up and believe me, I've picked up plenty.make a great gift.

Orphans is a dead end kid driving a coffin with big tires across the Ohio River wearing welding goggles and a wife beater with a lit firecracker in his ear.\\" Tom Waits<br /><br />A 54 song masterpiece is what I call this new Tom Waits 3 CD rumble. A phalanx of songs from every period of life and every genre of American music.  He has separated these 3 CD's into a concise set of marvelously named originals called 'Orphans\\"- 'Brawlers, Bawlers, and Bastards'. His wife Kathleen collaborated with Tom, and they have done his fine whiskey voice justice.<br /><br />Brawler, disc one, was my least favorite, but I have listened 4 times and this set has grown close to my heart. The 16 songs on this disc are a mix of juke box, Muddy Waters blues and honky tonk, clangy tunes. 'Sea of Love' is done with a clever twist.<br /><br />'Bawlers', disc two, is my favorite full of ballads of gone wrong.  20 songs a mixture of saloon songs , Celtic songs and torch songs. 'Tell It To Me' is a country song full of yearning and the rest of the group is as lovely and sad as you would want. They all give a message of the end of the road and hope is strong.<br /><br />'Bastards' is an amalgamation of songs that don't fit elsewhere.  20 songs, some experimental, from Army Ants to King Kong  and a poem by Bukowski. Tom Waits has some strange stories to tell on disc 3- 'night, night'. This is the perfect ending to a three series set that frames the art written and sung by Tom Waits.<br /><br />Tom Waits was named as one of VH-1's Most Influential Artists of All Time, and it is no surprise that Waits' body of work has long been covered by other musicians. \\"There is also a long list of artists who have cited Waits as an inspiration, including Bob Dylan who named Tom as one of his \\"secret heroes\\". Boston Phoenix<br /><br />As Tom Wait said in an interview \\"The center of this record is my voice. I try my best to chug, stomp, weep, whisper, moan, wheeze, scat, blurt, rage, whine, and seduce.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is brilliant! This is one of the best documentaries ever made and it is also one of the year's best films. Al Gore's look at Global Warming will surely win an Oscar (it did) for Best Documentary at the upcoming Academy Awards. The directing by Davis Guggenheim is brilliant. The music by Michael Brook (who, ironically, did the music to another documentary this year, \\"Who Killed The Electric Car?\\" (2006) and the title song (which also won an Oscar) \\"I Need To Wake Up\\" By Melissa Etheridge is brilliant. The film editing by Jay Lash Cassidy (who has film edited Sean Penn's directorial effort, the upcoming \\"Into The Wild\\" (2007), he also film edited Penn's directorial efforts, \\"The Pledge\\" (2001), \\"The Crossing Guard\\" (1995) & \\"The Indian Runner\\" (1991) & Dan Swietlik is excellent.

B00005JPC4|5.0|I really don't understand all the bad reviews from critics and reviewers alike for I personally loved this movie.  Now, it's not the grandest spectacle to grace the big screen nor is it Russell Crowe's finest hour, but `A Good Year' is some quality entertainment and serves it purpose in the relaxed and happy season that is fall.  Having just seen the poorly made and highly overrated `Catch a Fire' I was ready to relax and watch something entertaining and enjoyable, and being the Russell Crowe fan that I undoubtedly am I decided that `A Good Year' would be just that movie. <br /> <br />Max Skinner (Crowe) is a stuck up British stock broker who at one time was a kind hearted soul, and his fondest memories are littered with his Uncle Henry (Finney) and his Chateau in France.  Upon his Uncles death Max is left the sole owner of Henry's estate, and in like fashion he flies out there in order to sell if for profit and make it back ASAP.  What he doesn't bank on is Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) showing up claiming to be the long lost daughter of Henry and claiming rights to his estate.  Throughout the course of the film Max has to go through the stages of redemption, which include discovering the jerk he has become and rediscovering his inner child. <br /> <br />The two key components to his wonderful film is the scenery and the acting.  The script and storyline as some have already pointed out is very unoriginal, we've seen this done plenty of times, but the beauty that is France, as well as the beauty that is Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard (who plays Fanny, the seductive woman who steals Max's heart) more than make up for the familiarity.  Crowe is, as many know, my all time favorite actor ever, and I feel that he can carry any film he touches.  Whether you are a fan of his phone throwing escapades or not, you have to admit that the man is gifted, very gifted.  Here he proves that by being just as compelling and engrossing laughing and smiling as he is riding intobattle.  Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard are also wonderful here, but to me it was little Freddie Highmore (such a talented young man) who outshined most in the cast (can anyone outshine Crowe...I don't believe so). <br /> <br />As I said in the beginning, I don't understand all the bad press.  So what if it's no `A Beautiful Mind' or `Gladiator', so what if Russell was not Lucky Jack or James Braddock, `A Good Year' is still a good time and Max Skinner is just as fun as Crowe ever was.  I recommend it, I enjoyed it, no better yet, I loved every minute of it.

B000JJRIP2|5.0|First off, let's put an end to blaming Gene Simmons or Paul Stanley for the endless supply of compilations, live re-releases, greatest hits albums, etc.. OK? It's not theirs to dictate any longer. Mercury/Universal/Island...you pick. They are the ones calling the shots with these repackages re-released CDs.  <br /> <br />I too have wondered how many times can one set of releases be remastered? The KISS Box Set released a few years back is a perfect example of too much tinkering is not always a good thing. Compress the heck out of it and it'll sound great! Not always... <br /> <br />But with this \\"box set,\\" Mercury finally got it right. Not only with the CDs, but with the packaging as well. This is a really great layout. T42 Design is responsible once again. They've done the last few KISS CDs along with Paul Stanley's LIVE TO WIN album. Their design team is outstanding. And don't just look at KISS. Take a look at some of the later Willie Nelson layouts too. I digress... <br /> <br />All four CDs sound better than ever. Finally having ALIVE! and ALIVE II sounding like one show all the way through is cool. And for those who haven't the ears to notice...ALIVE III is outstanding. The drums are not what I would call great, but man, they are so much better than the original release. Let's not forget KISS fans; ALIVE III has never been touched since its release in 1993 (why KISS didn't have the entire catalogue remastered is still beyond me). Now, ALIVE III stands up very well to the first two. <br /> <br />ALIVE: The Millennium Concert is an interesting document really. Yes, you can hear that KISS (the original line-up) was getting longer in the tooth. Peter's drumming even during the Reunion of 1996 was no where near what it was in the seventies, but the man was around 54 years of age during this show. C'mon. His voice sounded good on Black Diamond and especailly Beth. Cut him some slack here. The quality of that recording is spectacular and overall it's a decent set-list.  <br /> <br />I've been a listener of KISS' since 1974. And while there has been so much more out there to listen to over the years, KISS still manage to hold my interest. Whether it's remastering re-released CDs or seeing members release new stuff, it is all superb material. No matter what.  <br /> <br />And I have to be honest here: KISS ALIVE 1975-2000 is something I have been waiting for since they mysteriously released the first three live albums in one set in '93 to promote ALIVE III.  <br /> <br />This is a great set. Thanks Mercury/Universal/Island...whomever...
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I bought this album because I saw the show in Vegas. Though not a Beatles fanatic, I have always appreciated their music. However, the show and this album do make you recognize thier musical genius. By blending tracks from their earliest pieces to those of their later works, you can see how they created a body of work that has never been rivaled. They transitioned from genre to genre as their music evolved from simple pop and rock and roll to more complex lyrics with social messages and mealodies that incorporated tones from around the globe. While other compilations tend to walk you through time and memories, this album pushes you listen to the Beatles work in a whole new way.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Every album they put out tops the last one.  This one has a definite Latin flavor.  Love their arrangements of Nights in White Satin, Without You and Una Noche.  The voices soar, they make me feel wonderful.  Thank you Il Divo, just for being you, and sharing your talent with us.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have nearly everything the Beatles ever did, much of it on the original vinyl, plus the newer anthologies, greatest hits, etc, and when I heard this was coming out, I was quite excited.  I read the reviews on Amazon prior to the album's release to try to gauge just exactly what this album had to offer, and what made it different.  It seemed that everybody discussing the album was in one camp or the other.  One, the purist camp, believed that anything put together post-Beatles was/is an abomination and that \\"LOVE\\" is no more than a remix of old tunes undertaken to pad the retirement accounts of Paul, Yoko and George (Martin).  The other camp, the 'We Love Anything That Says 'Beatles' on It' faction, feel that any new music, better sound, or different remixing of old sounds is a great thing.  I fall somewhere between the two camps, but much closer to the \\"Anything is Good\\" bunch. Some of the post-Beatles offerings have been good, and some not much needed--for example, 'Beatles: Let it Be, Naked' was a waste, as was the new version of 'Yellow Submarine'.  I read the reviews of \\"LOVE\\" and then, on the day the album went on sale, went and plopped down my fifteen bucks for the CD/Audio DVD version at Best Buy.<br /><br />The first time I listened was on my Discman, and while I enjoyed it and found it innovative and fun, I wasn't overly impressed.  Then, today, I put the Audio DVD into my system and cranked it.  Sounds came out of those old songs that I had never before heard, even with my good system.  The sound is truly amazing.  At one point, one of the ambient sounds was so real, it made my look around.  It's like the Beatles are in the room with you, sharp and clear.  Also, it takes a few listens to hear all the snippets and riffs that fill in each song.  Martin has mixed two and at times three songs together, sometimes by slowing one down a bit, sometimes because they are the same tempo.  Several times, these mixes are nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />Here are my highlights on this Audio DVD.<br /><br />1. 'Because'.  A slow a capella version with ambient sounds similar to a seacoast.  The voices sound ethereal and nothing short of angelic.  It will send shivers up your spine.<br /><br />2.  Ringo's drumming to open up 'Get Back'. You've got to hear it to believe it.  Yes, you'ver heard it before, but not like this.<br /><br />3. 'Glass Onion'.  Interesting mix.<br /><br />7. 'Drive my Car, The Word, What You're Doing'---Wow.  You've heard them all individually, now listen to what happens when they are mixed and mashed.<br /><br />8.  GNIK NUS--'Sun King' played backwards, including the lyrics.  And it sounds wonderful and strange.<br /><br />16.  \\"Octopus's Garden\\".  What was a fairly mid-level Beatles tune becomes one of the highlights on the album, thanks to the clarity and the new mix.<br /><br />20 and 21.  'Revolution' and 'Back in the USSR' never sounded better.  'Revolution sounds similiar to the track on the 'Anthology', a stripped-down version.  Great.<br /><br />22.  HIGHLIGHT OF ENTIRE ALBUM--\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  George Martin's first new orchestration for a Beatles song and according to the liner notes, his last.  An acoustically-based version, very simple, with a classic George Martin score.  This is the one song on the album that may actually be better than the original, though I imagine many would disagree as it is one of George's greatest tunes.  Listen carefully before disagreeing.<br /><br />24 to the end--Great rocking finish designed to make the audience leave with a big smile on their faces and assured them that dropping who-knows-how-much to see the live show was worth every penny.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles fan, you must get this album.  You will hear the classic songs but what Martin has done with them is nothing short of amazing, and it will move you.e my highlights on this Audio DVD.<br /><br />1. 'Because'.

B000JJRIO8|1.0|The question I pose,\\"Is this a product or piece of art?\\", should ring in your minds. This CD was more of a compilation to support the \\"new\\" artists featured, as they are the current trend of marketable icons. Moreover, 2Pac was not a \\"household item\\" during his times; if he was alive, there would not be a Tupac video game, feel me? That was not his style. <br /> <br />Why not just leave all his tracks unmastered and raw,  keep the original artists on the tracks, but not artists from 2006...because it would not sell to the majority  of young listeners. I am in my mid 20s,  and  a Pac listener for over 10 years, if you understand the Marketing concepts of the music industy, the goal is to target the  highly marketable demographic of the current period.  My cohort (20s-30s) is of the working professional class, whom does not spend a lot of time watching all of this BS media on BET and MTV, so we do not get caught in th hype, which the marketers know. So instead of dropping this album for the listeners of Pac's generation, they drop is for the current demographic.   <br /> <br />Anyone of my generation who listeted to Pac will not support any of the last \\"chop suey\\" albums, we understand  real rap music, not the \\"product music\\" played on the airwaves today. <br /> <br />Here is a question for you all to ponder...Why is that when the surviving members of The Beatles released new unheard material about  10 years ago, they did not need to feature any new rock n'roll artists? Its because they were classic, and the music would sell no matter what. <br /> <br />Pac is classic too, forever a timeless artist. No disrespect to Afeni or the label, but if it ain't broke, then don't try to fix it. <br /> <br />Rest Tupac <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It is not surprising with today's plummeting collective IQ's and rampant ADHD symptoms that someone might misunderstand and, therefore, under-appreciate a work such as this !!!  <br />     Firstly, the mere fact that a genius such as George Martin ( the real 5th Beatle)is \\"at the helm\\", makes it a \\"family work\\". After all, he is the original producer and, therefore, the \\"Lighthouse Keeper\\" of the innovative genius that is the Beatle's music !!! <br />For those of us who are more musically educated, this is a revival of a Surrealist/Dada-ist genre of music known as \\"musique concrete\\" (not unlike \\"Revolution #9\\"), except that #9 was aleatoric and random at best, whereas, THIS work had infinitly more thought put into it's \\"flow, key changes, thematic and anti-thematic groupings, crescendos and decrescendos, etc. <br />This piece seems, to me, to be the soundtrack for John's (and now George's) soul voyage - across the universe.....Just as radio broadcasts are forever emanating from earth and crossing our galaxy (from \\"Burns & Allen, Abbott & Costello, up until and (unfortunately) including today's ghastly (c)rap music, this album represents a cosmic \\"wash\\" of the segment/essence of the Beatles' era, moving into our infinite universe...excellence at the speed of light !!!!!!! In fact, if a hostile alien race ever thought of \\"doing us in\\", this sonic time/space traveler might be the only thing that would redeem our corrupt existence ?!?!?!?
B000ASDFJU|1.0|It's not just on amazon where the disk suck. I bought my set from Best Buy and I had to take 3 sets back. After the 3rd set I took back I demanded store credit, they don't refund, because the disk sucked. They stuck, they skipped, they scratched whoever manufactured them need to do a recall.
B000FIMG68|5.0|My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV.  After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it.  However, it did not disappoint.  It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets.<br /><br />Season Two finds the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'The Others'.  There are additional characters.  I won't say where they come from, but be prepared for a shock.  Each LOST character carries personal baggage, has what might be called a tragic flaw, and in Season  Two, these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some.  Also, some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad.<br /><br />The writing and acting are outstanding.  It never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on LOST is not spoken.  The characters give 80% of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking, or their body language, even such little things as a raised eyebrow.  This minimalist dialog requires great acting, and the LOST cast is one of the best.  They certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers.<br /><br />There are more twists and turns on Season Two than Season One, which had to spend more time on character development.  Be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from Season One in more detail, or from the angle of another person, and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes--some where you think the character is dreaming, but isn't, and some where you think the characters are acting, but are dreaming.<br /><br />Great color, sound, location, scripting, acting, suspense.  Highly recommended.  Five stars.
B000JJRIO8|4.0|To all my true tupac fans, I know you will agree wit me when I say this was a sub par tupac album. However because it is tupac, I will still support his work no matter what. Like a previous reviewer said, they need to go ahead a release his albums the way pac recorded them, with the original beats.I have the original version of pacs life (the song). Like many other real tupac fans, I knew every word the first time I heard it on the radio. I'm sorry to say that these new beats they have are not Pac. <br />  Granted I never met him in person, but I still feel that this is not the Pac I grew to love and respect. If they wantee to redo the beats they should have let the original producers that did the song remake it. It kills me that Johnny J. is not on this album. I believe there is not a better producer to produce 2pac than Johnny Lee Jackson. UTEOT is a perfect example. <br />  This is just my opinion, and like I said I will support pac no matter what he puts out. So until his next album( and ther will be another album) if you are a tupac fan wether you like it or not you need to cop this album. Support 2pac Until The End Of Time. <br /> <br />2PAC AINT DEAD-The Truth <br />Makaveli is dead, but 2Pac still remains <br /> <br />\\"This is Pac's life....and everybody needs to chill\\" <br />\\"Pac's life....playa hatas wanna see me killed\\" <br />\\"All these negros is mad at me....cause they cant be like pac!!!!!\\"
0312995423|1.0|This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|It's a big yawner. Anybody with a reasonably respectable Beatles MP3 collection and a $40 computer program (Goldwave) could have created this album. There is frankly nothing new or imaginative. Not only that, the remixes detract from the originals. This music would likely work well in the context of the show, but fails to stand on its own as an album. All the hype is nothing more than yet another McCartney/Ono Christmas money grab.
B000I5X81K|4.0|For those who love Josh, they will buy this album no matter what.  You won't be disappointed at all.  It is another of his classic albums.  However, as some have pointed out, this album is a little more \\"hard\\", but that almost seems like a ridiculous word to use for Josh Groban.  His voice is flawless, smooth, luxurious and amazing.  For some, they would like this album better than some of his softer others. You cannot go wrong with any Josh album though.
B000002LEE|1.0|Absolute mindless tosh, stick to Iggy pop , this is a waste of plastic and oxygen on the part of the artists.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|For anyone who's a serious die-hard Beatles fan who thought they heard 'every little thing' the group ever did (the hours of 'Get Back' bootlegs, the mono 'White Album', all the 'rarities', Anthologies, and all the original LPs then CDs) will be amazed and impressed at what Sir George Martin & son did for 'Love' -- it must be heard, especially in 5.1 surround sound, to be believed.  The original idea that George Harrison and Guy Laliberte (founder of Cirque du Soleil) to make a soundscape of Beatles music for a CDS show has been wonderfully realized.   Songs we all heard for decades and hundreds of times over sound new again -- more so, the 'mash-up' concept literally re-invents the songs -- hearing 'Mr Kite!/She's So Heavy/Helter Skelter' yesterday for the first time was astounding -- the riff of 'Hey Bulldog' that makes a brief appearance in 'Lady Madonna', the string arrangment put to the demo of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', the newly remastered and remixed 'I am the Walrus' (finally!) -- it's a new day for Beatles fans.  Some might view the Beatles' catalog as a sacred cow that should remain fixed and 'as was, as always should be' as they recorded it, and not be 'mashed-up' (all the superimposing of parts of one track onto another, time-shifting and altering the recordings to match tempos and keys).  Understandable, since how indeed can really improve upon what they did way back when?  But I very much enjoy 'Love' -- and appreciate that in with today's modern recording (Pro Tools was among the credits), Martin & son were able to present the timeless and beloved Beatles tracks in a new light, while making it clear how incredibly gifted the Beatles were -- you can hear all the instruments, vocals, sound effects better than ever before. While 'Love' might not be the best choice for a casual fan (one who has the red and blue best-ofs and/or '1'), it is an aural bonanza for a serious fan, in particular of the 'Revolver' era onwards with a focus on the psychelic years.  To paraphrase the dearly departed George Harrison, I dig 'Love'!!
B00005JPC7|5.0|A disclaimer: I've got a high tolerance for quirky and this film certainly qualifies as such.  I loved it, but I love quirky films a lot more than the mainstream moviegoer.<br /><br />I went to see this movie on a whim and so I didn't quite know what I was getting into.  But a few minutes into it I just KNEW that it was going to be one of my favorites.  And, indeed, it is one of the best films I've seen in the theater in a while.  I smiled throughout the whole of it.<br /><br />The story is new.  The characters are engaging.  And the plot is so very random that it just works.<br /><br />Now I'm one of those people who ALWAYS questions the logistics of say *time travel* and/or *magic doorways* but this film was so very charming that I wasn't bothered by how incredibly non-sensical it seems: an author *creates* Will Ferrell's character and can decide if he lives or dies with her *typewriter*?<br /><br />Oy.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is, it's a fairy tale of sorts for a new and modern society.  It's filmed in such an aesthetically astute manner.  The actors are at their very best and most endearing.  And the writing is wholly engaging.<br /><br />It's NOT your typical Will Ferrell movie and if you go into it expecting fart jokes and prat falls, you'll be disappointed.  But if you go into it with an open mind and a receptive heart, I imagine you'll be quite touched by the ideas it's trying to negotiate in its sweet and clumsy way.
1594481717|5.0|I just got done reading through A Whole New Mind, I started about a week ago.  I am 26 years old, married to a wonderful and beautiful wife with two girls (one 2 years old and one 8 months old).  I have known for a while that I love what I do for a living (transportation engineering consultant) and that I work for a great company with great people (started working right out of college almost 4 years ago). With all of this wonderful life, I have only recently discovered my own true worth, which has helped me to create a better work-life balance (but not great at this point).   <br />  <br />I want to thank Dan Pink for taking the time and effort to write this book, it is what I have been looking for (insightful, funny, and actually gives ways/steps to do what the book says by means that are for the most part freely available in abundance). I am glad that I have discovered this book (thanks to one of many mentors at work) at such a young age and a pivotal time in this ever changing world (I actually called my brother - 25 years old, who was studing to get into an MBA program, during Chapter 3 to tell him to read this book before he studied another minute). From what I can tell, Dan Pink has had an extraordinary and fulfilling journey writing this book, I only wish I have his kind of success in life. <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|I think someone else once described this show as \\"Nancy Drew meets Peyton Place\\".  That's pretty much it really.  (Plus an awesome soundtrack, an incredibly engaging cast and razor sharp dialogue.)<br /><br />The greatest thing about this DVD set however is that it does a nice job of wrapping itself up at the end.  There is a nice little cliffhanger on the last disc to get you into season two, but by the end of it, you'll know who killed Lily.<br /><br />I believe the writers pointed out that they were inspired a bit by Twin Peaks but unlike Twin Peaks they realized they had to actually give the audience an ending every now and again lest we all become bitter and frustrated and disinterested.<br /><br />It's one of the best tv shows I've seen.  I cancelled my cable years ago because nothing good is ever on and the only thing I regret is that it means I have to wait for Veronica Mars to come out on DVD.  Still, she's worth the wait.<br /><br />If you like sassy girls and smart quips (a la The Gilmore Girls) I think you'll find something valid and worthwhile in Veronica as well.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I think the biggest gripe about this CD stems from a premature judgment that the recording is unoriginal, or that Loreena hasn't created anything new since \\"The Book of Secrets\\".  Personally, I couldn't disagree more: my initial thought was that \\"An Ancient Muse\\" was really stunning.  The greatness of it comes from the BLEND of old and new--it's true that there isn't anything different or edgy, the songs are a blend of old Loreena and something more contemporary, taking the best from older recordings like \\"The Visit\\" and \\"Parallel Dreams\\" and infusing them with the Asian beats of \\"The Mask and Mirror\\" and \\"The Book of Secrets.\\"  We're led in a more cosmopolitan direction--we hear a Celtic-Asian blend, so to speak.  Perhaps in the future Loreena's travels will take her in an entirely new direction, but for the time being, her music--in every one of its incarnations--is better than ever.
B000002H97|5.0|I am ABSOLUTELY GIVING THEIR ALBUMS 5 STARS BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEIR ALBUMS. THEIR MUSIC IS NOT BORING AT ALL. KIRK HAMMETT IS MY OPINION ONE OF THE GREATEST GUITAR PLAYERS IN THE WORLD AND LARS IS EXCELLENT!! THE BLACK ALBUM IS BEST AND GOT SOME OF THE GREATEST SONGS LIKE ENTER SANDMAN. THE ONLY SONG THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT PUTS ME TO SLEEP IS NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. MOST OF THE OTHER TRACKS ARE GOOD. THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN CRAPPY BANDS LIKE PINK FLOYD WHO SUCK AND WHO ARE HUGE DISASTERS. GET MOST OF THESE GREAT METALLICA ALBUMS BUT STAY AWAY FROM ALBUMS BY PINK FLOYD WHO SUCK BIG TIME!! <br />
0553062182|3.0|I'll write more about this book-I think but, It is very sad the author tells you everything but, the fact that your ADD/Aspergers/LD/ any combo of any of these. And I know most if not all the people with this wheather they know it, or want to admit it, are one of those things; if not a combo.  And that's more important to know then you are a highly sensitive person which is just part of a side effect sorta often to any of those differences/disabilities.  And the fact she doesn't know she has one of those things after her extensive research shows some of the limit she briefly mentioned she had about what she mentioned and told in her books.
B000I2IT44|4.0|This DVD frustrates me a bit, mostly because it very easily could've been an amazing concert DVD but ends up being merely good.  <br /> <br />The performance itself is good, the sound is very well done (as you would expect from Steve Wilson), and the camera work has a very professional feel to it compared to a lot of other concert DVDs. However, the setlist is a bit short, and a lot of the shots have been given 'artsy' effects like grainy images or black and white - I'd rather just have it filmed normally.  <br /> <br />My other gripe is that for most of the concert there's absolutely no audience interaction or talking between songs - it results in the DVD feeling more like a music video than a live performance. I don't know if this is a result of editing or if there really wasn't any talking during the concert. This does change during the encore, when Steve Wilson suddenly starts talking and joking with the audience, and during Trains breaks a string, resulting in one of the more 'real' moments on the DVD.  <br /> <br />Overall it is a good DVD, but I'm not sure it's that different from just putting a Porcupine Tree CD on.
B000I5X824|5.0|When I first heard that Staind was coming out with a greatest hits album, I was a bit surprised because it hit me from left field.  Once I heard that it included several live acoustic tracks from a \\"secret\\" concert held in NYC in September, I was very excited.  (Of course, I was a bit upset that I missed that concert considering I was eating dinner at a restaurant upstairs!!) The CD has some great songs.  Yes, they could've put a few more, but then it would just be a box set of all their CDs!   <br />One of the tracks that shocked me was \\"Come Again\\".  I was thrilled it was included because it gives new listeners a chance to hear Staind's older stuff.  A very different and amazing sound!  I would say that my favorite part of this collection is the live acoustic songs that were included.  Staind sounds incredible acoustic.  Their cover of Tool's \\"Sober\\" is breath-taking.  The power behind Aaron Lewis' voice and the rest of the guy's instruments is phenomenal. There is a version at Best Buy that has a few Bonus Acoustic Tracks.  This is a MUST HAVE for any true fan or new fan.  Do yourself a favor and go buy it RIGHT NOW!  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! <br />
0962477060|4.0|Not much is left to be said about this remarkable book, but here's my take: its strengths and weaknesses interact in a compelling way.  Its strength is in its emphasis on patterns and visual, mnemonic devices at the expense of theory or even of reading music, and at the expense of any reference to songs or styles.  FL gives one a remarkable set of tools without telling you what to build or how to build it--that might seem a weakness.  But I rate this lack of musical, stylistic direction a plus--one must find one's own musical way after FL gives a player a basic vocabulary.  Others have criticized this book for its emphasis on patterns rather than on playing scales in the manner a pianist would, with a clear understanding of every note played.   In fact, knowing what key and scale one is in is (nearly) essential in its method. But as in many of its lessons, FL leaves the matter of how one connects its visual patterns to conventionally conceived scales up to the player.  Thus this book is a daunting but usually a good teacher: if it has many theoretical holes in it, these are to be filled by the creativity and initiative of the individual player.  (This is a plus except in FL's department of \\"lead patterns,\\" which are allegedly the skeletons of guitar solos, but they have almost nothing melodic about them, nor are they in any essential way the backbones of solos.   I find them too skeletal to be useful.  Other information in the book informs my imagination of leads.)  The only editorial recommendation I would make to the author is that he cut down on the rather nerdy-sounding, unnecessarily exclusivist rhetoric of the \\"all other texts are wayward and even goofy, but lo, here is the method\\" sort.  A little of that goes a long way, and concessions to other methods of guitar education would broaden, not limit this book's appeal.  Also, this book could acknowledge that it is not the end of the road: there's a lot more to be understood about the guitar than is spelled outhere.  This is not a new or final method, but a way of synthesizing a lot of basic information and, especially, conceiving it visually in compelling, clever, and memorable ways.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Just when you think \\"I have heard every Beatle song 10,000 times over the last 35 years, what can possibly be different about this?\\" Well,this is very different,it's fantastic listening,and yet one more time the genius of the Beatles and George Martin produce another gem.All the reviews by music critics over the past few days gave this album top marks,I agree.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a fitting chronicle of and tribute to the men who served in the 101st Airborne's Easy Company. The excellence of this series honors the brave men who fought for freedom and for each other. As the grateful grandson of a WWII veteran, this series served to enhance my respect for my gradfather and all those who fought tyranny and agression during the war.<br /><br />Every episode (my favorite being the one about Bastogne told from the medic's perspective) in this series is excellent. The tales of the men of Easy Company come to life in the acting, cinematography, and story-telling.<br /><br />There are moments in this series that make me weep and moments that make me proud to be an American. More often than not, these are the same moments.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this collection highly enough.
0440238609|1.0|This trilogy is indeed diabolical. The temptation- a captivating, nicely written story- but beware of the message- the world view that the book is advocating is that God is really an evil angel that is just pretending to be the Creator. The devil's revolt was actually the work of good angels. God only does bad things. The enemies of God also do bad things (like intentionally killing children) but they should be forgiven because they are working for the good cause of killing God. There is absolutely no discussion or attempt to show a different viewpoint. The evils of the church are the evils of God. Period!<br /><br />I guess that a lot of people missed these points because they are skillfully camouflaged in a truly imaginative story! But be carefull! Messages work on your subconscious reasoning if you don't think about them rationally. Analyze the message carefully!<br /><br />I read to the very end hoping that there was going to be some discussion or debate, but no. This is a bigoted, narrow-minded, hateful worldview that is pretending to be humanistic. It is presenting half-truth in order to make the rational plausible. All the bad things people have done in the name of God was God's fault and the good things they have done are not even mentioned!<br /><br />If you think this is just a bit of harmless fun and should not be taken seriously, be careful.  The story is indeed very imaginative and captivating, which makes it even more evil. If you hate God this is the book for you.<br /><br />P.s., it is really \\"funny\\" to see religious people making such a fuss over Harry Potter, which is a truly moral story, when there are abominations like this one around. This book openly preaches God Hatred! (Which is different from just not believing in God- This book states God exists but he is evil)<br /><br />I don't believe in banning any books but I am very, very sorry I spent my money on this book.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Excellent demonstration of the data needed to prove his points.  Very compelling.  Gore has done a very nice job of framing the argument beyond \\"a shadow of a doubt\\".  For once, there is DATA to back up opinions.      However, the political biography is irrelevant to the point, beyond self promotion.  All it does is drive those who aren't bleeding heart liberals (and I'm not! and can't stand the left equivalent of Pat Robertson or Pat Robertson) away from understanding his excellent work.    It would have been 5 stars, except for the ME show.    Also, the whole idea of packaging the DVD in paper is idiotic.  As it wears out quickly, it will have to be replaced with a plastic case for durability.  CO2 saved: zero.  We go through this everytime some pompous pop star tries to make a statement without understanding what CD/DVD packaging really does. i.e. U2 and Sting.
B00005MP58|5.0|Miss Austen's Pride and Prejudice is wonderfully brought to life in this A&E version of the story. The characters, locations, clothing and manners are superb. It is much better than the Keira Knightly version, which I saw only reluctantly. Miss Bennett is lively enough that she does not need to be modernized. <br />A note: Bridget Jones's Darcy is Mark. Miss Austen's Mr. Darcy is Fitzwilliam.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is better than anything on the Beatles Anthology CD's.  Surround DVD blows them wide open.  \\"A Day In The Life\\" as it should be heard.  Absolutely breathtaking.  The clearity of the distorted guitar lead on REVOLUTION.  The vocals of Back In The USSR, Or Hey Jude make it like a new trip through back into time only better.  George Martin was really one of the Beatles when you listen to this wonderful project.  His son must have received his talents for producing too. \\"I Am The Walrus\\" \\"Get Back\\"  there are so many good moments here with lots of surprises. <br /> <br />It's no wonder Paul, Ringo, Yoko, and Olivia approved this masterpiece. <br />This will be a monster hit.  The audiophiles are going to go crazy and the mixes are so well conceived that I'm freakin lovin this !!!! <br /> <br />Thank you,,,,more more more.  Lets get the whole catalog in DVD-A or Surround 5.1 Dolby. <br />
B000J10ERO|3.0|I enjoyed this but it seemed to be missing some of that Magic that we got from the first two Superman movies. Routh is good but lacks something Reeve gave us in his portrayal. He also doesnt seem to have much of a character or dialogue here. Perhaps they can flesh that out in the next one.<br /><br />The action scenes are ok but nothing special. I've seen better in Smallville.<br /><br />Bosworth, as others have said, has been good in other movies but lacks that certain something you need when you are playing Lois. Her scenes with Clark lack chemistry.<br /><br />I think with the right tweaking and a better writer, the next Superman could deliver on a much bigger scale. Another good decision would be to get Welling in there, the person who should have been cast in the first place.
0375831002|5.0|My local librarian suggested the book to me as we have previously discussed I was looking to steer from the murder/mystery genre on a daily basis.  We were discussing a variety of books including Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones and I mentioned that I thought I was going to find the narrative from a girl in heaven to be awkward.  She then suggested that I try this book even though it was narrated by Death and catalogued as young adult.  Of course who knows books better then a librarian?  As far as I am concerned, nobody does.  I ordered the book and received it 2 weeks later. <br /> <br />Upon beginning the book I was extremely tortured.  First off, I am Jewish.  Next, I remember my relatives having their arms tattooed with the identification numbers from the concentration camps.  All that aside, if possible, I was tortured as a reader as to how to pace myself through this magnificent piece of literature.  Often times I read at a rapid pace so I can continue on with the author's journey and find out immediately what happens with the characters and how they grow within the book.  In this particular novel, despite my yearning to move on and see how each page progressed, I was also torn with the fear that by reading too fast, this wonderful journey as poetically described by Death, would end far too soon for my liking.  Albeit I enjoyed every word penned by Mr. Zusak, I knew that as each word entered my brain it was another word closer to the end of what would become one of the top ten novels I have ever read.   <br /> <br />I will not go into any synopsis of the book at this time as I don't believe in spoiling this great literary masterpiece for others.  But I will say that I hope you all take the time to appreciate the sweat and tears that must have poured from the author's heart and soul as he penned this phenomenal series of pages.  With each turn of the paper you should find a poignant message about humanity, death, life and the appreciation of so many things we ashumans take for granted in this world.  At the same time you may also discover that you find beauty in the things that others find terrifying.  You may cry at times and realize that for some perverse reason you are actually crying with tears of joy.  You will also discover that the true power of words are not just what is found in a piece of recycled tree and marked by a chemical process - no, the true power of words comes from deep inside the human soul and is indeed mightier then any sword we have yet to discover.  <br />
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I first became aware of Loreena  Mckennett from hearing her rendition of 'Bonny Portmore' on the Highlander tv series and just had to have it, so i bought ' The Visit' and was 'Hooked' big time. <br />  I have to say that those who are comparing' An Ancient Muse' with Ms Mckennett's other works are being unfair and narrow minded. Yes some of the music will remind you of some of her other work but this is true of all recording artists. <br />  In my opinion 'An ancient Muse' is her best work. It is haunting, and Ms Mckennitts blend of celtic and mid eastern sounds is both rare and beautiful in that it has the ability to take you to and ancient time and place and still leave you wanting more. This is what listeners should be focusing on. The sound retains the celtic with a mid eastern flair.  <br />  Some reviewers have complained that this work is too slow, but are forgetting that this is the pupose of the work. It has to be enjoyed on it's own merit. I highly recommend this piece. If you want strickly celtic sound then pick up her 'Live in Paris and Toronto' cd, this is also one of her best works. <br />  'An Ancient Muse' is worthy of those who want good music and a great time listening to something different.

B000002KE2|5.0|This is the best Black sabbath album of the Ozzy years. Bloody, Sabotage, are close.Ever since I was six years old listening to my dads copy of this record in the basement, I've been hooked.The best songs are; Wheels of Confusion, a slow sludgy rocker with a nice break into mid paced solo insanity. Next comes Tomorrows Dream,my favorite,a straight ahead rocker with a beautiful mid song break down.Then Changes, a ballad which is very emotional. Twenty four years of listening to this album, it is now a once in a while song.FX is nothing. Supernaut is a killer tune. Side 2- Snowblind, if you have not heard this song then you suck! Cornucopia is a very dark song, but very catchy, another fave. Laguna Sunrise is a very nice acoustic instrumental, not out of place. St. Vitus' Dance is a very sunny happy song which is another personal fave. Last is Under the sun which is a great song but its wierd, the middle part of this song and Deep Purples-Flight of the Rat from In Rock sound very similar(from around the same time to).The prodution of this album is very murky, which I find adds atmosphere to the whole thing which makes happy songs such as St. Vitus' Dance keep there edge.All in all one of the best albums ever recorded.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Peterson does a fine job in getting the epic thing down..this movie is epic...and seriously long.  Pitt would at first seem a perfect fit for Achilles, but when you see his petulant, preening, performance, like some bad caracuture of a top runway model, you wonder, would Daniel Craig have been better?..and frankly Pitt's face is showing the ravages of a three pack a day cig. habit, but whatever I always thought his looks where overrated anyway, as for Bana, who played Hector..bravo..he is great, much better that he was in the horrible, Hulk...Brian Cox is great as always and the story is interesting, it is long, yes, but the action keeps the movie afloat so to speek.  This movie is not Gladiator, but if all your looking for is a bit of escapism then this may fit the occasion..but think about renting it...if you buy it, im not all together sure you'd want to watch it again, but who knows..your call, your money.
B000I5X81A|4.0|They're advertising this on radio Station 93.1 JACK FM in Los Angeles as being an Eric Clapton release when it clearly says that it's by J.J. Cale ex-Velvet Underground.<br /><br /> But JACK FM 93.1 in LA sucks anyway.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|This is definitely a different album compared to the others but I don't imagine that Pac would of picked this kind of production for one of his albums.  Some of the beats just kill the mood on Tupacs voice, it doesn't hype you up like it would normally do. 3-4 songs are good the rest are just not there.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I love love love Il Divo, but this album slightly disappoints me!  They REALLY need to come up with new material and stop the remakes already!!!  Their version of Nights In White Satin is totally exquisite, but lets mix it up with some new exciting things we haven't heard before...and if anyone could do it well it is Il Divo!  By seeing the other reviews, they better do it soon or they will lose a huge fan base, and it would break my heart to see them not succeed!  I beg of you Il Divo, let's hear something original!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|When you die they say your whole Life passes before you, that is sort of what happened to me when I first listened to this disk. Memories rushing back of a lifetime of listening to the Beatles. I was apprehensive about this project from the beginning, but one reviewer hit it on the nail, this is what I want to listen to on my last day on earth.
076531178X|5.0|Brandon Sanderson strikes back with his latest novel, Mistborn: The Final Empire, and what a book!  Elantris (his other book) was a fine debut but lacked some of the qualities of what makes writing great; Mistborn is wonderful because Sanderson's writing has grown to a new point of wonderful. <br /> <br />In a world where the Lord Ruler supposedly saved the world from the \\"Deepness\\", a devastating something or other, a thousand years prior everything is dying.  Everyday ash falls from the skies and only the rich have small gardens of yellowed plants (flowers being considered a myth from the past). Two distinct groups exist: the nobles (favored by the Lord Ruler and devided by House) and the \\"skaa\\" (a group of serfs who aren't even considered human).  Noblemen are known for sometimes taking skaa lovers but law requires them to kill the woman when they are through with them for fear of creating a 'mistborn'. <br /> <br />The Mistborn are a rare group of people can 'burn' ten different types of metals in order to tap into various powers, which is called Allomancy.  They can do everything from SteelPushing (which allows them to push off of any metal) to burning Tin (which inhances their senses to the extreme). <br /> <br />One of the Allomancers is a man by the name of Kelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin.  Several years prior he had escaped the mines of Hathsin, a place so brutal that most died from the pure strain of the work and horrible conditions, and has been plotting since.  Now he is back in Luthadel, the capital city, and planning to break into the castle of the Lord Ruler to steal his supply of Atium-an extremely rare metal that gives one who burns it an extremely powerful ability-in order to help the rebel Skaa. <br /> <br />Along the way you get to meet a vast cast of unique characters who present important parts of the story without your ever knowing it.  For the beginning of a trilogy it is fantasticly deep and a definite break from the oridinary.  One particularly unique aspect of the story is that at the start of every chapter you get a blurb from the journal of the Lord Ruler himself.   <br /> <br />Remember, there's always another secret.
B000067J24|2.0|This film is pure formula - predictable and cliche filled - except for the camera loving Penelope Cruz's face it offers little. They put a partial quote from USA Today on the DVD container \\"Plenty of Steamy Sex\\". What? For a total of 10 seconds from the three scenes in the film. And where is the comedy? Classified as a romantic comedy, only a few scenes with a taxi driver are fun. The transsexual Monica (Cruz's best friend) is suppose to provide most of comedy (as Cruz has not yet shown that ability in any films that I have seen) but her role is all cliche and seldom funny. Cruz's face is gorgeous as always, but her walk down the street with a hundred guys trailing, all tantilized by her beauty - why? The cannot see her face; her ballerina background is evident with her very slender build and then add an ordinary walk.  On a positive side, they did a wonderful job presenting the music of Brazil - the soundtrack CD is worth examining if you love the film's music. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: I watched this film because Penelope Cruz was the starring actress. But I feel I wasted my time, I could have done my laundry.
B00000F14B|5.0|I hate musicals...but man I LOVE this movie.  The music is so innovative.  The minimalist pieces can still work on alternative music stations.  The full-spectrum pieces are beautiful & innovative without being sappy and are true building blocks of the plot.  The twists and color of this plot are rich with many artistic, complex overtones.  The casting is brilliant.  The photography is more than solid. <br /> <br />A movie that my parents introduced me to more than 30 years ago makes my kids on impulse, get up, and start dancing around in front of the screen.  Man, I love this movie....and the soundtrack.
B000641Z90|5.0|ok i'll admit i haven't seen \\"live and loose in paris\\" - the one that everyone else is harping about. but in my humble opinion, this is the best live concert dvd that has ever been released. i'm an audio engineer by profession and i found the sound on this dvd to be phenomenal. not great, not outstanding, but unbelievable. the production is marvelous, as is the performance by mr. collins and his band. if you've ever read a review by an unkown person and acted on it, take my advice and buy this dvd right now! there's no way in hell you won't enjoy it, not if you love phil collins, not if you love a good concert, not if you love good music.  <br />cheers

0812975219|4.0|Taleb delves on the lines of chances in life, exemplified in this book via the stockmarket. Taleb has drawn on his experiences as a trader to show that the superlative earnings of a few stockmarket \\"wiz-kids\\" could have been due to sweet lady luck's doing than their skills in \\"predicting\\" the market. <br /> <br />Taleb careens between sanity and philosophy very adeptly, explaining quite complex theories/happenings in simple words for common folks. Though, in some cases he comes up as a know-all pseudo-intellectual who is overtly empasiszing on this concept. <br /> <br />Everything said and done, its a well written book, very fresh and novel in its approach to chance. Well worth a buy.
020530902X|5.0|I was handed a copy of the 80-year old classic, \\"Elements of Style,\\" as a young man over twenty-five years ago as part of my orientation package when I started college. I recently read it again as a refresher and I suddenly realized what a timeless classic it is. Of all the books I've read about grammar and writing this is the one to which I refer over and over again.<br /><br />It's a tiny little book; almost a pamphlet. But world renowned authors swear by it. You will too. The meat of the book is compacted down into three simple groups of \\"rules.\\" They consist of eleven \\"Elementary Rules of Usage,\\" eleven \\"Elementary Rules of Composition,\\" and eleven \\"Matters of Form.\\" I'm not sure if there's some cosmic meaning behind the number \\"eleven,\\" but I couldn't ask for a more concise, to-the-point set of principles to guide me as I write my prose.<br /><br />The feature I like best about this book is how easy it makes grammatical research. No heavy tombs to thumb through trying to find an obscure rule of grammar. No need to hop back and forth between computer screens to search for a phrase. Just a quick little reference guide that easily fits in my shirt pocket that stands ready to come to my aide on a moments notice. This book is the most important contribution to literary arts since pen and paper.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about improving the quality of his or her writing must own this handy little book.<br /><br />Joe Waynick, Author<br />\\"Internet Bookselling Made Easy!\\" series<br />[...]
B000JJRIP2|5.0|I had no intention of picking this up, but simply couldn't resist after hearing that Best Buy was selling it for $20.  I knew at that point that the 'bonus tracks' supposedly found on the Best Buy version were nowhere to be found, but I figured that would have to be rectified sooner or later (Gene and Paul are currently working with Universal about fixing that mess).  Let me just say I am really glad I picked this up. <br /> <br />The packaging is great.  The box folds out much like a DVD set, and it comes with a nice booklet with some cool photos and liner notes from everyone involved in these live recordings.  The Millenium Concert sounds AWESOME.  I really was impressed by the sound quality; the guitars are thick but not overbearing and all other instruments/vocals sound great.  It's nice to have a live CD from the reunion line-up.  Alive 1 - 3 also sound great - the remastering here takes nothing away, and only makes these classic recordings sound better. <br /> <br />As far as the whiners complaining that \\"Alive IV\\" isn't on this set, well, they must be the same people who blame KISS for all these re-releases.  Alive IV was on a different label than the other 'Alive' albums, so it only makes sense they are not included in this box set (you do have to own the rights to release something kids).  Even I admit it would have been cool if it was included, but I understand why it isn't.  Just like I understand that record companies put out compilations and re-releases, more often than not without the bands input or approval. <br /> <br />After picking up KISSOLOGY and seeing what a great live band they really were, I'm really glad I have these live CDs as part of my collection.  Get it at the right price and you can't go wrong.  Pick it up at Best Buy, keep the receipt, and wait to hear how we can all get '2000 Man' and 'God of Thunder' to add to this great collection.

B00005JPBP|3.0|The Prestige is a terrific film, in which there lies a secret, a twist, a climax, and yes... a prestige. The term \\"The Prestige\\" is a term in magic that refers to the third phase in an illusion. Not only does something magical and wonderful happen (not so in the case of Huidini) but when all goes well the audience should sit stunned and flabbergasted at what they have just seen... or didn't see. Christian Bale, as always - and I mean always (Empire of the Sun, Batman Returns la-de-da-etc...)- and Michael Caine manages again to pull of his wise charm. Hugh Jackman is dark and sinister, as is almost everything and everyone in the film, and achieves one of his better roles. And then there is Scarlett Johansen... She's blatantly underused, but this is after-all a story about two men and their rivaly, and there is little time to develop other characters.<br /><br />It is quite refreshing to see David Bowie in a non Labyrinthian role. He pulls rabbits out of many many hats. Movie plug. I am ashamed. He is quite the wizard, in a modern scientific way. Amazingly enough none of these men are quite as sinister as the unseen Thomas Alvis Edison, whose henchmen always seem to be on the heels of every electrical marvel that might infringe on the copywrite that he seems to have on EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I liked the Prestige a lot, and yes that's a friggin overused term, but I did. Poof.
B000H5V8DG|2.0|Just like many others, I was disappointed upon opening my Rambaldi box to discover that every disc in the set (beside the bonus disc in its hidden compartment) was deeply scratched.  With today being Thanksgiving, I haven't been able to contact Amazon to see about securing a replacement, but I will be attempting this soon.  It's a shame that greater care wasn't taken when designing the individual season holders inside the main package (which is quite impressive itself).  For a limited edition item, this leaves much to be desired, even though the show held within should rate much higher than the rating I've given this set.  Buyer beware, and check your discs as soon as you receive this item!
B0009S4IHY|3.0|If nobody told me this was a comedy I would never have guessed that was the intent of this movie.  I'm sure Asian humor is different from American humor, but I'm surprised there's THIS MUCH DIFFERENCE.  I've seen plenty of kung fu movies, old and new, and most of them are pretty far-fetched.  With that in mind I thought this was a semi-typical kung fu movie. <br /> <br />Was I entertained though?  Sure I was.  I thought the story and action were very original and intriguing.  The two musicians and their deadly music didn't seem comical or hokey to me.  I thought it was very inventive and probably the most compelling scene of any kung fu movie I've watched.  The \\"Budda Palm\\" and the \\"Frog Style\\" might have been funny to some people but who am I too say what doesn't count as a mystical martial arts style. <br /> <br />I only rate it 3 stars because the label \\"comedy\\" disappointed me.  When I watch a comedy I want to laugh.  If it were labeled as \\"action\\" or \\"martial arts\\" I would've rated it higher.  So I won't say it's a bad movie, just don't be disappointed if you don't get any laughs out of it.

B000HZHBIM|4.0|I was a [...]starry eyed boy growing up on Bergstrom AFB near Austin in the latter half of the 1970s.  I had friends and life seemed fine but it was one film that changed my life forever - \\"Star Wars - A New Hope.\\"  After seeing that, I discovered the classic \\"Star Trek\\" shows on television, and those stories formed my love of writing and media.  When I found out that a \\"Star Trek\\" film was going to be released, I bugged my parents to take me to see it at the base theater.  I loved it!  Seeing my favorite characters in a new story just brought so much joy to this heart.  The film made millions of dollars thus launching a franchise that is still here today.  9 motion pictures and 4 television series later, Star Trek LIVES!  In 2000, the late Robert Wise re-edited ST-TMP and released that version for DVD.  I'm so glad he did because his version is the only one I want to see now again and again.  I'm so thankful for that because now that I am embarking on my screen writing career, one of my projects is to create an original Trek podcast series for free downloading, based in part on both ST-TMP and the aborted Trek series that morphed into ST-TMP.  I always wanted to contribute to Trek, I think I found a way to do so.  Look for my announcement of the podcast series in Spring 2007 on Star Trek-New Voyages and other fan-based Trek sites.  God Bless You, Mr. Wise for your contributions to Trek and to film as a whole.  God Bless You, Mr. Roddenberry for bringing Trek to my generation and to new Star Trek fans still to come...<br /><br />Mark McLaughlin - marknetproductionsentrance.[..]

0790729628|5.0|It is not often a film brings together an excellent cast, superb story and ground breaking special effects.  This movie makes you think what really makes us human.  If we are made of flesh and bone, possess logic and function in society, we must be human.  But what if a machine has these same exact traits?  Are they human as well?  This is a great movie built from a great book while I highly recommend.  I only wish it has a bit more action.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|When I first heard that Oliver Stone was the director of another \\"too soon\\" World Trade Center movie, I thought, \\"Oh no!\\" Started doubting if I even really wanted to see it.<br /><br />Not that it is too soon. Clearly, judging from the current state of American politics, it isn't. Maybe \\"overdue\\" is more like it. How soon so many of us do forget. I think Americans - maybe the World - in this day & age NEED a reminder. Sad, but true. We seem to forget so very easily. Just go on with our lives. All the while, the enemy is focused. So, forget the \\"too soon\\" angle. That was not a concern for me.<br /><br />But, Oliver Stone???? Hey, no doubt, the man knows how to make a movie. Clearly, he is a great filmmaker. That wasn't a concern, either. I was very worried about the angle ... Americans are the bad guys, the Bush Administration imploded the buildings, there are NO terrorists. So, during the drive to Asheville yesterday, that's what I addressed to my 3 eldest daughters who accompanied me to the theater. Inside, I was feeling like perhaps we should have stayed home.<br /><br />Man was I mistaken. I will not offer a review here. Just see it!<br /><br />It was not at all what I expected. Forget the angles, even the film making was way different than I anticipated. I anticipated epic shots of buildings crumbling; vast panoramas depicting planes in flight; masses of people fleeing in terror. You know, recreations of all we had seen on the news - live in many cases - on that dreadful day 5 years ago. A HUGE movie. It wasn't. It was small. The only \\"big\\" pictures were on televisions in the background being watched by family members & co-workers. The movie tells small stories within the big one. You only experience what the characters were able to experience.<br /><br />Small does not mean not powerful. And the angles were of love ... of honor ... of heroism.<br /><br />Wimp that I am, I cried throughout the ENTIRE movie. No exaggeration! My eyes were pools of tears for however long that movie ran. Tears trickled down my cheeks at regular intervals. It was all I could do to keep from breaking down bawling at points. There was not a sound in the theater, except for sniffles.<br /><br />Those were my countrymen; that is my homeland; I grew up on those streets ... I kept thinking that, over and over. I don't know what any one else was feeling or thinking, but I'd wager it wasn't much different.<br /><br />In the end, I was certain of one thing ... Oliver Stone gets it. Kudus to him. A masterpiece!<br /><br />NEVER Forget, friends!s for however long that movie ran. Tears trickled down my cheeks at regular intervals. It was all I could do to keep from breaking down bawling at points.

B00000K19E|4.0|Though I believe that this film was a bit hyped for more than it truly is, it is still one of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time.  Computer and camera effects paved the way for the next generation of special effects.  Though there are flaws in logic, such as where the humans consume their energy, since there is no sun or plant life, they can be over looked in order to really digest this flick.  Just pretend that the flowing two sequels never were filmed.
B00005221M|5.0|After two enthusiastic campaigns, and a very long wait, the much sought after, eagerly anticipated Director's Cut of LOTM has finally been released. Presented this time around via the high end of the technology spectrum, DVD, the Director's Cut promised, at least, to be a superior edition visually and audibly to the original. The story content itself, having undergone another round of editing, remained questionable in regard to its improvement or lack thereof. There was to be additional footage, widely welcomed, though no one knew what exactly these additions would be. The director, Michael Mann, had edited the release which offered reasonable confidence that the re-editing would be an enhancement ... would it? Here, we offer one, actually two, opinions on this ...<br /><br />What's NOT Here: Largely because of discussion & speculation here on this Web Site, expectations were huge for this release. Dances With Wolves, when released in Director's Cut form, had nearly one hour of additional footage ... While no one thought there'd be THAT much new material, it was generally assumed there would be 15 or so minutes, including a \\"love\\" scene between Alice & Uncas, added to the film. All based on pre-theatrical release reviews, plus comments made by many of the principals in various interviews, most Mohicans fans eagerly awaited more, More, MORE! Forget it! It's not here. That's not, it is obvious, what Mr. Michael Mann had in mind for this gem of a release. More on that later. There is NO Alice/Uncas love scene. In fact, this release does absolutely nothing in the way of furthering that relationship. It stays as it lays. Uncas has not one additional line, Alice one or two. Nearly all hypothesized new scenes are nowhere to be found on this DVD. In no one's wildest imagination, did anybody think that some material would actually be CUT from the original. That matter was never addressed. So, though, it is. GONE ... Not ever to be heard again in the DVD-age are SEVERAL of Hawkeye's most quoted lines ... things like \\"Clear it up any?\\" \\"Just dropped in to see how you boys is doing!\\" \\"Someday you & I are going to have a serious disagreement!\\" \\"Nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?\\" All have seen the axe. Part of the exchange between Hawkeye & Cora at The Burial Ground has been lopped off. That one hurts. No longer do you hear, \\"That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense!\\" What??!! Can it be? Want to hear more? Clannad's I Will Find You no longer lilts through the misty riverside air as Hawkeye, Chingachgook & Uncas begin their journey to rescue the Munro sisters. It just isn't there. No matter how many times you play it over, it's still gone! Disappointed? Go on, admit it! You feel terribly disappointed! Sulk awhile. Go on! Feel morbid depression, consider a leap off the ledge at Nature's Shower Bath. Get it all out of your system! Allow yourself to feel the pain! Then, FORGET IT! In any case, you still have your wide screen THX video version to savor, so get a grip! Now, place your hopes & expectations aside. Forget that you've ever seen The Last of the Mohicans. Go out and buy the new Director's Expanded Edition of this classic film and bravely pop it into your DVD player. Go on. It really won't hurt. Get ready to watch 1992's The Last of the Mohicans again ... for the first time!<br /><br />The DVD Experience: Perhaps, you are like us, you've never before owned a DVD disk. Get ready for a real treat. You will never, when given a choice, want to watch a VHS tape again. You have immediate scene access, you can zoom in intimately on any shot. Sure, you can also pause, run in slow motion, rewind and fast forward. This time, though, with a difference. What you see is crystal clear! No more blurred images or lines running across your screen ... just pure IMAGE ... and you can run it at various speeds. The normal picture quality is near-perfect. You get vivid, rich colors. Details long lost in the murky gloom of the VHSnight scenes will POP out at you while watching the DVD version. You'll see things you never saw before, much like watching the 35mm film on the big screen. For that quality alone, this is the definitive version to view. Like sound? Distinct stereo separation, even on just your TV's speakers, can be heard ... Every little sound becomes a part of the viewing experience. You will miss nothing. Clear, precise sounds ... no distortion ... the sights & sounds will cause you to fully be engulfed by the film. If it was the identical release to the original, you'd still feel like you were watching a Director's Cut, so much more will become apparent to you. Such is the quality of a DVD. You will be amazed. Oh, and did we mention the optional sub-titles? Never again will you have to guess what it is characters are saying. It can all be there for you, on screen, if you so choose. If you're at all like us, all these little perks will provide you with long moments of exploration & amusement, causing The Last of the Mohicans to run for well over 3 hours, instead of its listed 117 minutes.<br /><br />So, What IS Here: Only 117 minutes, you say? Yes, and that's only 3 minutes over the original! Figure that maybe up to a minute of time was sliced out, that leaves about 4 minutes, total, of new footage. [Well, so our math is a little off! See MM's mathematics below!] That can be a lot of film, and so it is ...<br /><br />The first thing that you'll see is the dazzling The Last of the Mohicans title bouncing seductively on your screen. Then you'll be greeted with Hickory Nut Gorge, thunderous waterfalls, scenes from the movie, and you will have an opportunity to explore the DVD ... choose Language Selection, to set your sound & caption preferences, view The Cast, select various scenes, or play the movie. Go ahead. Play around a bit. Then, click on Play Movie, sit back, relax, and enjoy the awesome splendor, the beauty of the cinematography, the spellbinding soundtrack, the powerful images, the adventure, the action, the romance ... watch as Michael Mann transforms his 1992 masterpiece, real \\"subtle\\"-like, into a MASTERPIECE ...<br /><br />It is obvious that Mann intended to reconstruct a portion of Hawkeye's character. No longer the pop-action hero, he has become serious, intent ... at the end, almost boyish, as he questions his adopted father, Chingachgook, high above Linville Gorge. The Hawkeye we see here is a stronger Hawkeye. No more flippant remarks in this life or death struggle. Hawkeye's main aim here is survival! Possibly for the same reasons, Clannad's haunting melody was removed. Out of place in this primeval wilderness, the tune is replaced by the Trevor Jones/Randy Edelman score. During the battle sequences, The Siege and Massacre Valley, the music is mixed down considerably allowing the sounds of war - the stark realities - to permeate the film. During the former, the score is allowed to fully explode upon the scene only as the fort is reached by the main characters. During the massacre, the theme rises in intensity, but again, is only allowed to bear its full force on the proceedings as Hawkeye and Cora embrace ... great stuff!<br /><br />As you watch, after being floored by the clarity of the image, you'll be delighted by the deeply rich colors of The Elk Hunt. Then, nighttime at Cameron's Cabin brings you into a whole new world. Just TRY to absorb all those details in just one sitting. Here, too, you see the first addition to the film, a new take of John Cameron grabbing his rifle, a cautious approach to the door, and then, after realizing who is drawing near, uttering the first new line, \\"Alexandria ... Set 3 more places.\\" So very quietly, Mann sets out to actually strengthen the story by skillfully placed morsels that help to further relationships, spotlight motivations, and establish political climates. Re-introduced is Le [Renard] Subtil, Cooper's Magua; as known to the French ... The Sly Fox. We see, even more, Duncan asa warrior, courtesy of the new Courier Diversion scene. We realize he is very much the same as these warriors of the forest. We hear, and see, a very effective new piece at Webb's HQ's, providing amplification of the British/Colonial dispute early on. Cora & Alice have brief new things to say at the patroon's house connecting their past a bit more to 1757 colonial America. We see the column of escorting soldiers symbolically enter into the wilderness. The Abenaki Chief, Magua, Jack, and especially Montcalm & Colonel Munro are given new life through an added line or use of a different take. It's all very small tinkering on Mann's part. Nothing monumental, but its cumulative effect certainly ties the underlying stories that are the foundation of this film together in a much more palatable fashion, especially benefiting the uninitiated. For your information (DVD scene name in parenthesis), the main expanded scenes would be: The diversionary efforts of Heyward to enable the courier to flee to safety under the cover of Uncas and Hawkeye (A Run To Fort Edward), The Parlay scene (Terms For Surrender) which is radically expanded to our benefit, providing more interplay between the two antagonists, the former Clannad scene (Stay Alive) which intersperses, beautifully, scenes of the captives being hauled away, at one point set against a radiant sunset, with shots of their Mohican rescuers in pursuit ... you can hear the pants of exhaustion, sense the desperation ... and the final scene (Last of the Mohicans), where Chingachgook rightfully takes over the title role and artfully allows him to become the wise elder, poignantly foreseeing the future of the frontier. It is a grand moment that makes a strong ending even more puissant. All we could say was, \\"Wow!\\" Fifteen scenes, in all, are listed as containing footage not seen in the original theatrical release, though we were hard pressed to spot them in one (Lovers), and found little added things in two scenes not listed (A Stirring in the Blood and Trophies of Honor). Bits & pieces skillfully interwoven into the substance already there to create the definitive version ... Or, as the liner notes say, \\"[Michael Mann's] definitive vision of the film.\\" We couldn't agree more!<br /><br />A Word On The Blemishes: Several reviews mention uneven editing of this new cut. In fact, included with the DVD is this little note: \\"In order to create it [this DVD version], certain shots had to be lengthened, resulting in a momentary jump in the image.\\" We noticed but two or three. These minor flaws are easily negated by the overall outstanding image clarity, deep colors, and improved sound.e powerful images, the adventure, the action, the romance ... watch as Michael Mann transforms his 1992 masterpiece, real \\"subtle\\"-like, into a MASTERPIECE ...  <br /> <br />It is obvious that Mann intended to reconstruct a portion of Hawkeye's character.

B00006WKSZ|5.0|I would say this is the best album from Scorpions where you can really appreciate their live performance,unfortunately was the departure of Uli Roth,in case you didn't know Michael Schenker left UFO that same time as ULI left the Scorps. they both left behind two great live albums STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT & TOKYO TAPES and went on to form MSG & ELECTRIC SUN If you wanna have the best live sound of Scorpions this is the one and from UFO (STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT)TOKYO TAPES deserves 5 stars for sure!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This CD is the perfect blend of cultural, classical, soft rock, hard rock, and bluesy music I have ever come across. It exceeded my expectations, and I am a tough critic. I generally do not like every song on any album or every song by the same recording artist; but even on my first listen, I love every song on this album! I cannot describe how beautiful it is--you just have to buy it and see for yourself.
0689878451|5.0|This book is a great book, beautiful and cleverly written. I love that it is based on the true story of penguins in the NY zoo and I am sad that people are trying to use it as an excuse to spread their hatred and bigotry. Children need to be taught love, tolerance and equality and people like those represented in some of the reviews here are those that would see only a white, middle-class, heterosexual male world. It is time for people to stop teaching hatred and start teaching acceptance. Books such as this are a great start. Every child should be able to read books like this to help them learn that the world is not a black and white place as many of the reviewers here would have you believe.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Ridley's younger brother has created his own brand of of action movie (Enemy of the State, Man on Fire). Thanks to Scott's distinctive cinematography, pacing, music and production values, Spy Games succeeds despite the mildly self-conscious performances of the leads, Redford and Pitt. In Spy Game, Scott does his typically masterful job creating a sense of place recreating Viet Nam, Cold War Berlin and the Middle East in the early 1980's. His attention to small details and the choice of supporting actors make repeated viewings a pleasure.
B000J103X4|5.0|This album is so good!! When I first put this CD I knew right away that this CD was gonna be amazing. At first, I thought I was listening to like an old Deathrow Records release which is tight. Then listening closer I was like is that Dr. Dre rapping?? He really sounds a lot like him but still unique and different in his own way. The only track that I could do without is \\"Scream on Em\\". Game is still good on the track but the music is just kinda wack. I cannot stand Swizz Beatz that guy is an awful producer.
0618680004|5.0|This is a perfect example of a person screaming at what amounts to people he thinks foolish and being just as foolish himself. Dawkins is not upset with religion as many with adequate educations use the word but consistently argues that is not a proper use of the word. Religion instead is the belief in the ridiculous. In short, Dawkins is upset with the way uneducated people think about God. He further blames a great many of the world's ills on this God delusion. This is much the same approach that Sam Harris took in \\"The End of Faith\\". It is clear to me that what these folks are riled against is the thinking, or relative lack of it, among the uneducated. So in this respect, Dawkins voices a shared interest with educated people everywhere that the more people become better educated the better off we will all be. But in an ironic twist, Dawkins continues to demonstrate his own lack of education (\\"The Devil's Chaplain\\") even compared to his fellow biologist (Stephen Jay Gould -- \\"Rocks of Ages\\") and so shows precisely how a lack of education coupled with the anger bred by a lack of understanding , plus enthusiasm, just makes a mess of things.  Dawkins might just as well argue that we should all be born adults and not have to start out as immature human beings. Worse, Dawkins certainly misses that for many of those who will lead productive lives, a childhood full of beauty and wonder, as many scientists he describes, built that education on the rock of ages, religious narrative. His own enthusiasm demonstrates his own ultimate concern which to religious people demonstrates religious commitment - a view he denies because of his selective definition of what deserves the name religious. His own critique of Alister McGrath's attempt to educate him in this regard (\\"Dawkins' God\\") just shows he is playing checkers in a chess game. If we give up story and fantasy we will lose good as well as bad. How much of good science began as pure fantasy?
B000641Z90|4.0|First off, you should buy this DVD.  There's no bigger Collins fan than I, so I may be a little more critical than the average fan.  The drum solo to start the show is worth the price of the DVD alone- it will give you goose bumps.  The show is great- sound quality, direction, and length.  My only complaint is the lack of older Collins tunes.  We've all heard the same songs live on other cd's and DVD's, so why not include some others like: I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me, Inside Out, Everyday, or something from the Face Value album besides In The Air Tonight?  I'm tired of seeing/hearing the same 15 super-commercial songs on all the live albums/dvd's.  Buy it.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.   <br /> <br />All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.   <br /> <br />The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment.
0060005696|5.0|If your like me and want to understand why making choices are so difficult and what you really gain from deliberating for so long you should definitely read this book.  It is very enlightening, easy to read, informative, and fairly concise with plenty to back it up.  Highly recommended.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Arcade Fire is a band from Canada, Montreal to be exact. The Members of this band are Texas born Win Butler who sings lead vocals, is the chief song writer and also is the lead guitarist. Régine Chassagne, wife of Win, who was born in hati, emgarted at a young age, co founded the band, plays many different insurments in the band (do not ask me which ones, as I don't know which ones). Richard Reed Parry who plays tom, tambourine, keyboards, electric guitar, and accordion. Sarah Neufeld  is the violinist in the band. Jeremy Gara is on the drums    Funeral opens with a slow hypnotic plodding key board with a low fuzzy sounding electric guitar underneath, then lead singer, Win butler's world weary vocals come in softly before booming out \\"we forgot all the names that we used to know\\" whit in the first couple of minutes of the opening track you know that this is something different.     The great tracks tracks keep on coming, the next stand out moment on this album comes in the form of the bombastic thrills of \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" which is mezerising its sheer power and emotion, also has a brillant musical promo clip to go with it, which is worth a look, if you want to see the acomping clip, best bet is to head on to you tube.     The other stand out track on this album is \\"Wake Up\\". The track begins with a somber and meanceing gutiar riff, the band must have found the happy pills, because at roughly minute four the tempo swiches form somber and meancing to joyous carvilesce atomosphere, with brillant harmoising bettween the band members, annother slice of brillance.     The penultimte song Reblion (Lies) is another supurative track.    There is not enough good things that can be siad about this band, its very diffacult to believe that thiz band have only relaeased the one album, this sound like their fifth, if this leves you feeling a little chily on the first time arround, listen to again, by listen four you should fall in love with album, it is a rare breedof album that desreve all the hype that has surroned it.
B00005JPCA|4.0|First of all, I want to say that I would give this more of a 3.5 star rating, but Amazon doesn't allow half-stars.  It seems strange that a Bond fan like myself felt a little disappointed coming out of this film.  Myself and the two people I saw this with felt like something was missing from the film, but everyone else I know who has seen the film has loved it, claiming that it is the herald of a revitalized Bond franchise.  Looking back on the film, it is better than I first remembered, but I still feel like something was lacking. <br />Casino Royale serves as a reboot of the James Bond franchise; it isn't a prequel to the other films in the series despite the fact that it is the story of James Bond's first mission as a 00-agent.  It starts the series over, taking Bond back to his roots as a spy without super-gadgets and self-parody.  Bond (Daniel Craig) has recently been promoted to 00-status, becoming 007.  His first mission involves Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a terrorist financier.  After a botched capture in Madagascar, Bond is led to Le Chiffre by one of his constituents.  As it turns out, Le Chiffre lost a lot of his clients' money (due to Bond), and he intends to win it back in a high stakes poker game.  M (Judi Dench), who pretty much despises Bond due to his brash nature and relative lack of experience, orders Bond to join the game and make sure Le Chiffre doesn't win. <br />The film follows Bond as he learns how to perform as a 00.  M's assesment of Bond is not wrong, and he has a lot to learn before he becomes the suave agent that we are most familiar with. <br />The problems I had with the film had to do with the film's pacing.  It seemed like there would be action scenes that would go on way too long.  As a Bond film, action sequences are fun and expected, but in this film, some seemed to just be over the top and unending.  Towards the end, the scenes with Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) grew very tiresome and I honestly thought that they were partof a dream sequence. <br />Still, despite the problems that I had with the movie, it still had many enjoyable aspects, and I would reccomend seeing it.  It seems that after speaking to others who have seen the film, I am definitely in the minority, and I merely advocate that you be prepared for some pacing issues.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is easily the best album in 30 years (but that's not saying much). If The Beatles were recording today, this is the kind of album they would release. It captures the inventiveness and fun they introduced to music. I do recommend listening through headphones or ripping it to an iPod/MP3 player so you'll catch all the subtle sounds. George Martin and his son Giles have created a masterpiece. <br />To describe myselfL:I'm 55 and have always considered myself a fan, but not a fanatic.
B000IOLZZW|3.0|Let me start with the good or at least the acceptable.  The picture and sound quality are what you've come to expect from a mid-level HD-DVD catalog title.  Picture quality isn't \\"stunning\\" like some other releases, but it is obviously a hi-def dvd.  The sound quality is average.  The DTS soundtrack is only available on the regular dvd side.  The bad comes when you expect to see the same extras that were included in the original \\"collector's edition\\".  Gone are the bloopers, deleted scenes, videos & documentaries,  in fact the only real extra is a directors commentary with Ron Howard.  In a word PATHETIC !!   Universal seems to be trying to become the new FOX, expensive products with no value added features, my advice.....save up for the double dip.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Flawless gem! Makes ALL of today's rock/pop bands sound redundant (with the notable exception of U2). George Martin's genius is evident in every single track on the CD.. opting to present the complex tapestry of melodies in a seamless aural wave that washes over one inducing a hypnotic trance-like state (without having to resort to psychotropic substances!) Trippy! And totally essential.
B000H5TH1Q|3.0|It is interesting how many people have given this film such high marks. It does have some nice moments. Definately Hitchcock was in DePalma's mind during the fiming. But to say this is DePalma at his finest is just plain silly. \\"Scarface\\", \\"Mission Impossible\\", and \\"Carrie\\" were all superior. Still \\"Body Double\\" is a nice, fun ride. Additionally, the four extra featurettes (totaling more than 55 min.) are enjoyable to watch. Nice interviews with DePalma and the cast as they discuss aspects of the film. Sadly no commentaries, or deleted scenes, or other fun stuff. <br /> <br />I remember seeing this film in theatres when it came out and there is a scene missing from this \\"Special Edition\\" DVD. After viewing the video tape of Holly Body, Jake wants to go talk to her. Jake ends up in the dressing room of the adult studio \\"accidentally on purpose\\". In this scene, which is perhaps 2-3 mintues long, there is all kind of eye candy. Jake's eyes are all over the place when Holly says to Jake \\"the male dressing room is on the other side\\" That's when Jake gets his first thought of acting in a movie with Holly. Holly notices Jake's eyes enjoying the view, she says \\"so you like to watch?\\". Jake nods. Holly says \\"that's cool\\". Which is why in the very next scene Jake says to the producer \\"I like to watch\\". It is to bad this scene was cut from this DVD release. Maybe we'll see the complete film with all extras in Ultimate Expanded Edition. Who knows?
B000J3EEBY|5.0|AN ANCIENT MUSE.  Just the title seems to suggest songs celebrating the past.  Fans have waited a decade for this album, myself included.  Many reviewers will tell you it falls short of expectations or explores no new territory.....in some ways I find I have to agree...<br /><br />The album opens with the sun illuminating ancient landscapes in \\"Invocation\\" an instrumental chant both haunting and beautiful.  We walk through \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" starting our journey thru the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and the splendor of modern Turkey.  The song is steady and rhythmic and Loreena's voice has the same banshee/angel quality it always had...no disappointment here.<br /><br />The night finds weary journeymen who have camped for the night at a \\"Caravanserai\\"...an inn for the caravans of Asia.  She weaves a story of the many adventures and scenery she has seen before stopping to rest...on a journey home.  Easily her best song....great live performance can be seen at her website.<br /><br />Next a tale of Scotland's woe...words by Sir Walter Scott set to an arrangement of music by Loreena...as she sings of the tragic love between \\"The English Ladye and the Knight\\".  This kind of poetic adaption has been done before by McKennitt....\\"Snow\\", \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" and \\"The Highwayman\\" to name a few examples.  Her voice is strong and emotionally charged.....the most beautiful song on the album.<br /><br />From here on out....the rest of the album delivers some fine songs.  However, they are not as striking as the first four.  Disappointed?  I'm not...these songs will grow on me...I didn't wait 10 years just to tear apart her new album!!  So for now, I can say it is worth buying.<br /><br />If you like stories of history, tragic love affairs, and poetry...listen to Loreena McKennitt's AN ANCIENT MUSE.
B000GPIPSS|2.0|Universal's triple-dip DRACULA--the new 2-DVD \\"75th Anniversary Edition\\"--is the studio's reply to fans who had complained that the earlier transfer was too dark (1999, re-issued in the \\"Legacy Collection\\" of 2004). However, it is a very unsatisfactory reply. Some background: the original negative of DRACULA was over-printed (used too much) in the 1940s and disintegrated, so all we have are the prints themselves. They do not look very good on the whole, and short of finding a duplicate negative, no real restoration is ever going to be possible. That didn't deter Universal from using a print as mediocre as the previous ones and raising the brightness level--and the sharpness to a lesser extent--for their \\"75th Anniversary Edition.\\" The result is a glary, edgy picture in which the already high level of print grain is so exaggerated that the film is nearly unwatchable. Universal's overdone anti-analog/anti-digital copy-protection makes matters worse: if one needs to play the signal through a VCR into a TV--and the VCR permits it, the glare and persistent grain become even more unbearable. I have even seen terrible results with this DRACULA played directly into a monitor via component inputs. Universal's changes make it possible to see all the background details, but only because everything looks fluorescently lit; true focus is actually diminished amidst the glare. A film which, more than almost any other, is about night and shadows, now has scant evidence of either, the added artificial brightness lending every detail equal weight and depriving the film of visual dimensionality. Most black levels are now more often gray, and whites can be blinding. This was *not* the film makers' intent. One of the first remarks in the film, spoken fearfully as the carriage speeds toward the village near the end of the day, \\"we must reach the inn before sundown,\\" is now rendered ludicrous because it looks like noon in the desert. Dracula's subterranean crypt now has a bright light source as does the carriage rendezvous at midnight. Dark shots are made especially horrible by the relentless prominence of grain.<br /><br />For the first time on DVD, the sound has no erroneous omissions (the final VHS and the laser-disc were correct): the 1999 DVD accidentally erased the few seconds of Schubert's 8th Symphony that concludes the theatre scene while the 2004 Legacy Edition DVD omitted the death screams of Renfield and Dracula--originally removed by censors, restored for laser-disc in the early 1990s, and included in the 1999 DVD. Unfortunately, the quality of the sound elements used here makes it the worst I have ever heard--even compared with the most degraded TV prints: all dialogue is muffled, weak, and has a thick layer of buzzing distortion, many lines completely unintelligible; even viewers with normal hearing will need the English subtitles. Earlier DVDs had far better sound (especially the 1999 disc), and it is puzzling that Universal could judge the current sound elements to be acceptable. The primitive sound for DRACULA was never good, and viewers have commented correctly that the audio in the 2004 \\"Legacy Collection\\" release was inferior to the initial 1999 release. The sound in the current offering is similar to the 2004 edition but more intensely distorted. Why Universal didn't simply reuse the far preferable sound track from the 1999 DVD for both later releases, simply reinstating the erased notes at the end of the theatre scene, is a mystery.<br /><br />Universal has always been, and is still, confounded by the squarer 1.19:1 aspect ratio of early 1930s talkies. Criterion, on the other hand, dealt with the old squarer aspect ratio issue elegantly in their 2004 restoration of Fritz Lang's \\"M\\"--also a 1931 film, preserving the original 1.19:1 shape and the visual information by shrinking the image very slightly and \\"pillar-boxing\\" it (like letter-boxing on the sides rather than on top and bottom). Until recently, Universal tended simply to enlarge the print to later Academy standard 1.33:1 (really 1.37:1) and crop the edges. While that was already a poor solution, their current practices are more damaging and interventionist: shots are actually reframed, zoomed, and cropped to differing sizes at the discretion of the telecine engineer (usually losing more information than previously owing to a preference for larger images): in essence, making a pan-and-scan version of a non-widescreen film. The frame is occasionally shrunk as well as reframed to keep its contents intelligible: e.g., the newspaper clipping in DRACULA, like the one in THE INVISIBLE RAY of the BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION. While a simple zoomed and cropped image already compromised the original appearance, the creation of continual new image sizes and placements is nearly a refilming: this DRACULA goes farther than before in distorting the visual compositions of great cinematographer Karl Freund by inventing new relationships among shots.<br /><br />The wonderful simultaneously-shot Spanish DRACULA, also in the current set, looked splendid before (except for the worn show print--the single copy extant--used as a replacement source for the original negative's one missing reel); nevertheless, Universal has zoomed, cropped, shrunk, reframed, and panned/scanned it as well. Clearly, no 1.33:1 version of a 1.19:1 film will serve either film, but Universal's intrusive new procedures retain far less original visual structure. The added brightness is not as unpleasant in the Spanish DRACULA as in the Lugosi film because there is little grain; and because the original negative was already in such fine condition, Universal didn't overdo its brightness/sharpness intrusiveness. I should mention that like the 2004 \\"Legacy\\" edition, there are no ordinary English subtitles for the Spanish DRACULA, only subtitles for the hearing impaired that include transliterations of sound effects and place sentences on the screen near whomever is speaking them. Only the 1999 edition has the sort of English subtitles that one usually sees in foreign-language films.<br /><br />With all the visual rearranging, it is additionally frustrating that, in some respects, this Spanish DRACULA has a few more authentic elements than its DVD/VHS predecessors. According to leading authority David J. Skal, the original film had the same abbreviated stock \\"Swan Lake\\" title music that opens the Lugosi film, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, and THE MUMMY. But since the film never received copyright registration--and indeed, was long thought lost, Universal couldn't copyright it in 1992 unless they made minor alterations to differentiate it from the public-domain original elements. So they substituted another performance of the title music which has extra phrases, so it continued into the first fifteen seconds of the film, dovetailing with the opening dialogue. Apparently, Universal has since worked out the problem because the original, shorter stock \\"Swan Lake\\" title music is heard in the \\"75th Anniversary\\" set, ending at the same point as in the Lugosi film. Interestingly, the first exterior long shot of the traveling coach used to be shorter--and was panned more to the right than in this transfer. It is now extended by a few seconds--longer, in fact, than the analogous shot in the Lugosi film--even though the title music is now shorter; it also has been reframed to match the Lugosi version's current composition (more intervention). One must assume that the earlier version of the shot was cut slightly to provide a logical point at which the substituted music could end. Again to differentiate their version copyrighted in 1992 from the public-domain original, Universal inserted a few notes of music (the opening phrase of the Schubert symphony heard in the theatre scene) at several points where Dracula rises from his coffin. In the new transfer, Universal was able to dispense with the added music (at 24:10-33 and 40:56-41:14). While the corrections are a plus for owning this edition, it does not offset the intrusive overall visual revamping of both films. Moreover, perhaps to provide an alternate means of \\"differentiation\\" for copyright purposes, the closing ballet of the theatre scene--shots from the 1925/29 PHANTOM OF THE OPERA--now substitutes a performance of the same music (again, a snippet from the same Schubert symphony) that is too slow, ending the scene with an abrupt, jarring fade out-of-sync with the bowing dancers on the stage.<br /><br />The set does have the good 1998 95-minute British documentary \\"Universal Horror\\" narrated by Kenneth Branaugh (repeated in the \\"75th Anniversary Edition\\" of FRANKENSTEIN) and a terrible biography of Lugosi that amounts to 36 minutes of 2-second sound bytes. There's also a new, ill-conceived, unappealing commentary track by Steve Haberman (who created the moronic parody \\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\\"). The other extras are excellent: scholar David J. Skal's brilliant, enthusiastic commentary and his documentary \\"The Road to Dracula,\\" as well as the re-release trailer (also unnecessarily brightened here), and a poster/stills gallery; but these are all carried over from the 1999 and 2004 releases.<br /><br />The \\"75th Anniversary Edition\\" DRACULA is not a good replacement for previous editions of the Lugosi film. However, as some elements of the Spanish version are now more accurate, the reader can decide whether they compensate for the edition's many other deficiencies. The 2004 \\"Legacy Collection\\" set, still very much in print (UPC 025192445521), is a better way to experience Lugosi's DRACULA on the whole; it comes with all the 1999 extras including the Spanish version (the previous variant), as well as three Universal sequels, for the same price.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|My first two listens where of he 5.1 mix and the sound was great.  The vocals are emphasized in this mix but at times I thought the instrumentation was too buried.  Maybe it is the fault of my set-up.  I then put on the phones and listened to the stereo mix.  These are the best stereo soundscape I have ever heard and I've been listening to recordings before stereo was released.  The stereo sound is so clean, well balanced with each sound being distinct and perfectly placed.   Start with I am the Walrus to see what I mean. <br /> <br />I classify the songs on this album into three categories: Bascially intact (usually only minor changes to entrances and exits), Slightly re-invented, or Re-invented.  Here's the breakdown by song: <br /> <br />Basically intact <br />   Eleanor Rigby <br />   I Am the Walrus (best stereo remix ever) <br />   Something <br />   Help! <br />   Yesterday <br />   Come Together <br />   Revolution <br />   A Day in the Life <br />   Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (least effective stereo remix) <br />   All You Need is Love <br /> <br />Slightly re-invented <br />   Get Back <br />   I Want to Hold Your Hand (shortened, background screams) <br />   Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds <br />   Hey Jude (vocals and base freed up in the shortened ending course, beautiful base line) <br /> <br />Re-invented <br />   Glass Onion <br />   Drive My Car (great driving beat and blending with What You're Doing and The Word) <br />   Sun King (Knik Nus) (suprisingly effective) <br />   Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite (most experimental, one song where the 5.1 mix is better) <br />   Strawberry Fields Forever <br />   Within You and Without You (most effectve combination) <br />   Octopus's Garden (real fun and entertaining) <br />   Lady Madonna (a better version than the original) <br />   Here Come's the Sun (not better than the original but a masterpiece on its own) <br />   Back in the USSR (different vocals, more casual fun) <br />   While My Guitar Gently Weeps (undescribably beautiful, another masterpiece reinvention) <br /> <br />Lastly, many of the transitions are remarkably, inventive and some will blow your mind.  Starting with Because to Get Back will lift you out of your seat. Glass Onion to Eleanor Rigby, Something/Inner Light to Being for the Benefit Mr. Kite, Within You and Without You to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds (the most subtle and best), Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to Octobus's Garden, Lady Madonna to Here Comes the Sun, Revolution to Back to the USSR (so smooth and flawless), Hey Jude to Sgt. Pepper's Club Band. <br /> <br />George is 80 years old and not likely going to have time to do much more re-invention (and he is probably the only that should be allowed) but let's hope they immediately put him on cleaning up the sound and creating the stereo soundscapes on the rest of the catalog. <br />    <br />
B000HBKCDC|4.0|What a happy surprise, a seasonal, Christmas album with style and creativity! In this album, Sarah shows the true beauty of her voice, with great modulation and color, I just love it. <br /> <br />This is actually a mixed CD, since not all the songs are traditional Christmas songs, and the mixture works magically, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Four stars, almost five, and a bargain on Amazon to boot, at under $10. <br />You will definitely NOT be disappointed, this is classy, gorgeous, beautifully designed and executed music, both by Sarah, her children's choir, and the musicians themselves! <br /> <br />
1580495796|5.0|I hope all readers take time to read A CHRISTMAS CAROL in the original language Dickens used in the 1840's.  Dickens' language remains humorous, descriptive and insightful and not inaccessible to most modern readers especially with the use of a good glossary.    This is a great read aloud for families at Christmas time and also a great introduction to Dickens and other Victorian writers.  Don't settle for an abridged version.  Read this masterpiece the way it was intended
B000E6UK32|5.0|Awesome greatist hits package- The videos are so simple and entertaining you just want to watch them over and over. Debbie Harry is so cute that you just want to eat her up. Great songs and just a great album.<br /><br />I really recommend this to any fan of \\"new wave\\" or the whole New York Underground scene from the 1970's. One of the best Greatist Hits albums I have ever heard!  Long live Blondie and I love Debbie Harry!!!!
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|The first impression is of excellent recorded sound: transparent, perfectly balanced and full of colour; the orchestral playing and conducting equally sensitive and flexible, full of character and life. Mitsuko Uchida is a perfect Mozart pianist. Her playing is elegant, deeply felt, personal and wonderfully idiosyncratic. There are delightfully wayward moments with slow movements stretched to a gossamer thread. With playing of this character and refinement were these movements to last forever they would still be too short! A delightful set, truthfully beautiful - such music leaves one speechless and amazed!
B000J103PC|5.0|I think that they did an amazing job with The Devil Wears Prada.  I have read the book and the movie doesn't follow it at all. Even still, this movie takes on a life of it's own and makes it extremely enjoyable.  When I heard the movie wasn't like the book, I thought I would be dissappointed in the movie. This is not the case at all. The directors and cast did an excellent job. I would say to read the book and watch the movie because they are both so great in their own ways. Job well done.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|All tremendous recordings - \\"Window In The Skies\\" is great! All their biggest hits and unlike Best of 1980-90/1990-00 there are no questionable qualifiers. Even diehard U2 fans will enjoy.  <br /> <br />Having said all that - U2 is a famous band - not because of these singles but because of the other tunes on each of their albums. They are one of the few - possibly the only band - able to put interesting/enjoyable music on 10-12 tracks almost every time. <br /> <br />So...U2's greatest hits are really the albums \\"War\\" \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" \\"Joshua Tree\\" \\"Achtung Baby\\" \\"All That You Can't Leave behind\\" and \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\". Like the great 1960's/1970's rock bands - they are an ALBUM band. Even more than that - they are a band where their music comes to life in concert. <br /> <br />The albums and the concerts are where its at for the legions of U2 fans around the globe. Greatest hits albums are a distant second option.
B000056H7W|5.0|Wow. I've never heard anything like this before. I bought this album about a month ago, and since then, I've been trying to comprehend how an album like this could be made. I know that sounds pretentious, but you'll feel the same way if you listen to Blackwater Park. Opeth vocalist/guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt can rip your face off with his inhuman roar, but he can also soothe you with his clean whispering vocals anytime he wants to. The mix of aggressive metal and progressive rock is brilliant, and you'll never hear another band quite like Opeth. Even when  Blackwater Park is at its heaviest, it's still quite melodic. Mikael, along with his brilliant vocal switches, is a great lead guitarist. I love his solos on The Drapery Falls and the title track.  Peter Lindgren, while not as good as Mikael, provides a strong rythm guitar for Mike to work off. Martin Mendez's bass is kind of buried behind the rest of the band, but if you listen carefully you can hear him. I'd say he's most audible on Harvest and a certain part in the title track. Martin Lopez is an awesome drummer; his double-bass kicks and symbol tapping are done brilliantly on songs like The Leper Infinity and The Drapery Falls. I currently own 2 Opeth albums (this and Ghost Reveries), and while the other is great, I'd have to say that this is the better of the two.<br /><br />The Leper Infinity opens up with some very hushed piano chords, but then everyone's instruments kick in, and they create a very dark atmosphere for the song. Then, Mikael's demonic, yet comphrehendible, roar comes shattering through with \\"We entered winter once again!!!\\" I believe this song is about dying from a blizzard. Around the 5-minute mark, it quiets down with acoustic guitars, and we experience how Mikael can switch from a death metal growl to a prog rock voice. After a few verses of that, the song gets heavier and Mike sings away until the whole song collapses on itself, leaving some quiet piano chords to play, different from the ones played in the beginning. My 2nd favorite off the CD.<br /><br />At first, I didn't really see the genius in Bleak. But after a few more listens, it grew into possibly my favorite song off the whole album. The guitars are at possibly their best here, with Mike shredding away on lead. I also love the lyrics. I can't really explain why I like them so much (other than that they're just really dark, which I LOVE in my music), but somethingg about them sends chills down my spine.  And I love how, um, \\"bleak\\" the song ends, too. Even though it ends very dark, the lyrics around the end give you some sort of hope, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Harvest is the first song that fully explores Opeth's progressive roots. It's completely out of acoustic guitars, with the exception of an electric guitar that is quietly wailing away, and Mikael's singing is very clean. The calm atmosphere of the song is really haunting. Ehy? I can't say why, but something about it can chill you....<br /><br />After that prog rock epic, the album gets heavier with The Drapery Falls. My only complaint with this song is that the opening and the ending are a little longer than they need to be. Other than that, this is an amazing song. There are death metal growls in it, but this song is mostly overtaken with Mikael's clean singing. He even sings the opening lyrics, \\"Please remedy my confusion,\\" in clean vocals. I guess you could think of this song as a heavier version of Harvest with a little bit of death metal growls, which aren't used until the end of the song.<br /><br />Dirge For November has the least amount of lyrics out of the songs on this album that have lyrics, but that doesn't matter. The real brilliance of this song is the music. This is possibly Opeth's best music performance on this album. Mike's clean voice and an acoustic guitar hit the song at the same time until it gets heavier with awe-inspiring musicianship. Unfortunately, I feel it isn't as strong as the previous tracks. Still, quite an excellent piece of work.<br /><br />The Funeral Portrait opens up with some creepy acoustic guitar chords which give you the hint that it's definitely building up to something HEAVY. And heavy it is. It has the darkest lyrics, and the way Mikael mixes his clean singing with heavy musicianship near the end is brilliant in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />Patterns In The Ivy is a quiet piano/acoustic guitar interlude that fits in the album perfectly. Umm, since this is the song I listen to the least, I can't really say much more about it.<br /><br />The title track is my 3rd favorite song off the album. Other than the quiet intro, it's HEAVY, and the heaviest song here. It's the only one that doesn't have any clean vocals, and, along with Harvest, it's the song where Martin's bass is at its most audible (his bass is still audible, but those are the 2 songs where it's the most audible). And you gotta love the closing lyrics of \\"The sun sets forever over Blackwater PAAAAAARRRK!!!!!\\"<br /><br />This is an amazing album, and one of the best metal albums I've heard, let alone one of the best albums period. These guys really are geniuses, and this album shows it. This album has a very dark mood and dark lyrics, yet at the same time, it's beautiful in every sense of the word. It's the best album of 2001 (along with Radiohead's Amnesiac and Children of Bodom's Follow The Reaper), and possibly the best metal album of the decade.<br /><br />All 'n' all, I STRONGLY recommend Blackwater Park along with Ghost Reveries.<br /><br />Long live Opeth!!!!!!The Funeral Portrait opens up with some creepy acoustic guitar chords which give you the hint that it's definitely building up to something HEAVY.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I read Al Gore's book \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" and was very impressed with the articulate, easy to follow presentation, but this DVD version is \\"off-the-charts\\" as Mr. Gore so eloquently empathizes  while making points to the audience while using his many graphs and charts depicting historic and current global warming trends, etc.<br /><br />This DVD version is not a \\"movie\\" as such, rather it is a staged version of Mr. Gore's original slide-show presentations and has the benefit of an incredible assembly of  expert writers and film notables who followed Mr. Gore while he was giving his personal presentations so they could get  production ideas. This production is hands-down, the finest power-point presentation I have ever seen and gives the importance of the subject matter a moving and compelling voice. And it blows away all of those thoughtless and inaccurate notions that Mr. Gore is a less-than moving commentator- his passion and dedication come across beautifully.<br /><br />This DVD is augmented with a substantial amount of  \\"behind-the-scenes\\" production features which do Al Gore tremendous justice for his years of dedication and passion to educate the world of the critical importance of taking action on global warming. There is also a feature of Melissa Etheridge performing one of her poignant and beautiful songs heard in the presentation.<br /><br />My heartfelt thanks to Al Gore and his entire production team for this monumental achievement and I hope every person on this beautiful, but fragile planet gets to see it!<br /><br />Patrick C.

B000J6I0PM|5.0|The LA acoustic disc is fantastic and does include 5 more songs than the cd, however, both the cd and dvd still missed off Miracle, Virginia Moon and Floaty. All amazing songs particularly Floaty where Petra Haden (violinist) takes lead vocals. I saw the London Victoria Apollo gig and she was outstanding so why they cut this song is beyond me. Overall though the LA gig is very enjoyable and sounds great.    I notice Amazon don't have a track listing so here it is:    1.  Intro (Awesome!)  2.  Razor  3.  Over And Out  4.  On The Mend  5.  Walking After You  6.  Still  7.  Marigold  8.  My Hero  9.  Next Year  10. Another Round  11. See You  12. Cold Day In The Sun  13. Big Me  14. What If I Do  15. Skin And Bones  16. Ain't It The Life  17. February Stars  18. Times Like These  19. Friend Of A Friend  20. Best Of You  21. Everlong    A quick note if you plan on buying the UK editon: Although Amazon states this is Region 2 I can confirm it is Region 0, as are all UK music DVD releases, so this will play on any DVD player. So if anyone wants to import this dvd, say from America, you can play it on your Region 1 player providing that your TV can handle the PAL TV signal.
B0000039QA|5.0|Released two weeks after he died, LIFE AFTER DEATH is the critically acclaimed second album of Brooklyn's own Notorious B.I.G., one of the greatest hip hop artists of all time.<br /><br />A double disc set that debuted at #1 when it was released in March 1997, it is highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the magic that happens when infectious beats meet a virtuoso's lyrics.<br /><br />Packed with 24 tracks, LIFE AFTER DEATH best fits into rap's gansta rap genre, though the album offers more than a gritty social commentary on the crack epidemic that poisoned America's major cities during the late 80s and early 90s.<br /><br />With an optimistic, Shakespearean flare for puns and other word plays, the then 24 year old, Notorious B.I.G. distinguished himself here from other hard core rappers with a touch of the old school, good-natured braggadocio that characterized hip hop's earliest pioneers.<br /><br />An essential addition to any serious music collection, LIFE AFTER DEATH features collaborations with a variety of other artists, including Jay-Z, Ma$e, Lil' Kim and R. Kelly.  Some of my favorite tracks include<br /><br />* Hypnotize - an infectiously bouncy anthem to hip hop machismo;<br />* I Love The Dough - an exuberant testament to professional success that features the Jay-Z;<br />* Mo Money Mo Problems - Biggie's biggest hit ever which samples Diana Ross's \\"I'm Coming Out\\"<br />* Going Back to Cali - A love letter to California, this song would be particularly haunting (considering the fact that Biggie was murdered in Los Angeles) if it weren't a joyous, kid in a candy store look at California's good life;<br />* Another - a sparing \\"he said, she said\\" duet with Biggie prot&eacute;g&eacute; Lil' Kim.<br /><br />What makes LIFE AFTER DEATH a must have album for anyone regardless of what kind of music you normally listen to, is that nine years after its release this album sounds as a fresh and as relevant as the day it debuted.<br /><br />- Regina McMenamin
0618680004|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. I think everyone should read this book and humanity will be better off if everyone did.  <br />The first half of the book explains why there is most probably no God and the later half explores why we believe in God. I found the later half of the book much more interesting and I wish the author spent more time on this, though I understand that the scope of book didn't allow for more.  <br />I want to make one observation here. Dawkins explores this idea very briefly in later half of the book. From the part of world I come from (India), there is a lot of inter-religion rivalry, but there is also a lot of inter-caste rivalry. People who are ethnically the same; who share same religion, invent some new irrational belief to compete for limited resources available. I think, the roots of fundamentalism (and religion, and caste and ethnicity) might have something to do with this in-group mentality. I know of several atheists/agnostics who would defend their country or caste or ethnic group with the zeal of a fundamentalist religious fanatic.  <br />If we didn't have this mentality in first place, we wouldn't have different \\"races\\" and \\"castes\\" and \\"ethnicities\\" and religions !!!! People would intermarry, and there will be no differences.  <br />Perhaps, when we were roaming Africa for hundreds of thousands of years, this irrational in-group mentality helped us in some way. It would have been impossible to survive without a tribe back then. Even today, I think most people want to belong to some group, be it religion or nation or caste...I hope one day it would be enough to be an earth-dweller. <br />The harm caused to environment and fragile ecologies by our irrational believes is another scary aspect. I would recommend \\"Collapse\\" by Jared Diamond and \\"Man on Earth\\" by John Reader to explore these ideas. We are only beginning to understand how human animal affects the ecology s/he lives in. For a long, sustaintanable existence of human animal onearth, this needs to be explored more.
1592400876|4.0|I really liked this book. It was humorous and informative at the same time. I learned quite a bit and I laughed a lot. She has a great sense of humor--even if the jabs are mostly directed at the grammatically challenged. If you enjoy learning grammar and you'd like it to be fun, give this book a shot.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Having grown up reading Marvel comics, this movie drove me nuts. The visual effects were really dreadful, comparable to a cheap video game--I can't understand why so many people were impressed by them. Spider-Man moves like a puppet, the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger...they should have tried to do a little bit less with CGI figures, and shot more of the action with acrobats. Also, I can't understand why they put that raised plastic ribbing on Spider-Man's costume; it looks awful and it is unfathomable how a broke teenager could manufacture such a thing. Killing the Green Goblin was a bad dramatic choice--in the original comic book series Norman Osborn remained alive for years, alternating between amnesia and psychosis. This put Peter Parker in a state of perpetual anxiety and moral conflict and created great suspense in the storyline; one never knew when Osborn would slip into his mania again.   In spite of these problems, I liked the melodramatic aspects of the film a lot. The actors were likeable and the story was touching and well-told. It seemed strange that in a film like this the action scenes ended up being the weakest elements!
B000026OHN|5.0|Not being an \\"audiophilic\\" sophisticate I can hardly delve into details of this recording's sound reproduction, but it is not nearly as bad as to make this great performance un-listenable. Quite the opposite, as the sound's peculiarities reflect more than a mere recording technique here. Bach wrote WTK for the keyboard, but in his mind he probably heard them played on a particular instrument. If Gould (whose WTK, is among his weakest Bach recording, IMHO) plays it like a harpsichord, and Schiff (another dud) like fortepiano, every note of the Richter's performance echoes with the sound of an organ. I am certain it was deliberate on Richter's part (all his Bach sounds \\"organic\\"), and the fact that the recording venue was a church, only backs that notion. Of course, the church's acoustics affected the sound, but in a way consistent with the artist's conception.<br />As far as the playing itself, there is not much I can add to what was written by previous reviewers. Book II, which is a more \\"abstract\\" part of the WTK-48, receives great treatment here, but it is Richter's performance of Book I, which stands out like a solitary granite peak, high above the clouds, projecting mysterious and purifying force.
0307346609|5.0|I've been a fan of the zombie film since Night of the Living Dead. The premise, to me, has always been one of the most intriguing and terrifying of any set forth in the horror/sci-fi canon. Sure, 1984 and others painted a chilling picture of a world gone horribly wrong, but the idea of an epidemic- an incurable, rapidly spreading apocalypse- has always struck me as particularly scary.<br /><br />This is not a satire- there is no tongue and cheek present, despite what one may gather from the title and it's subheading (World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War). Sure, there are references to present conflicts and heads of state, as well as familiar terminology from the present. But it's not a parody- it is an honest and bracing attempt to hypothesize how the current world at large- with machinations such as globalization, the internet, and communist-cum-capitalist superpowers, for example- would deal with a crisis on such a massive scale. The short answer is \\"not well\\". The long answer, involving everything from America's advanced (and now useless) weapon systems to China's secrecy to Apartheid South Africa's ruthless and purposeful efficiency- is much more complicated, and much more thought provoking.<br /><br />The basic premise of the work, betraying nowhere its label of \\"fiction\\", down to the pull quotes and jacket, is this: In the first half of the 21st century, amidst all the well-known perpetual conflicts and cultures of the day, disaster strikes. It starts with an incident that will be familiar to anyone who's read \\"The Hot Zone\\" or \\"Demon in the Freezer\\". A single patient- Patient Zero- who is a resident of a rural Chinese province. From there, it escalates and spreads across the globe, taking an agonizingly long time to be identified for what it is. In China, it's a \\"contained health issue\\". In Capetown, it's \\"African Rabies\\" (in a nod to the attibution of a disease such as AIDS to a certain culture or population). In America, it's a virus treatable bya miracle drug called \\"Phalanx\\", rushed through the FDA as a placebo and eagerly snatched up by the population. In Israel, one of the few places to recognize the nature of the epidemic and secure itself, it is another Holocaust, one that can be prevented by sealing its borders and fortifying itself.<br /><br />After the initial outbreaks comes the incident referred to in the book as \\"The Great Panic\\", when the nature of what is happening is clear to every man, woman and child on the planet, with predictable results.<br /><br />All of these incidents- and many, many more- are laid out in the form of interviews with the people involved. From military personnel to diplomats to refugees to chiefs of staff to doctors, multiple viewpoints are portrayed. And realistically. As an example, I'll go with the military aspect. The military interviewees, especially American soldiers, refer to their enemy as \\"Zack\\", or \\"Gs\\" (\\"ghouls\\"). They routinely chastise their superiors for employing outdated methods to combat the threat- after all, what good is stealth weaponry to an enemy with no radar? What's the point of infrared when \\"Zack\\" doesn't give off any heat? Why is emphasis placed on \\"cover\\" when the threat can't fire a weapon? There is no condescending portrayal of the military here- only of the bureaucracy that pulls the strings.<br /><br />At the risk of spoiling the whole experience for the reader, I'll stop here. There are many suprises and heatbreaking stories in this work (one of the greatest being the Plan developed to save human race, with terrifying consequences).<br /><br />If you're a genre fan, pick it up. If you have an interest in hypothetical history, pick it up. It's a great read, and suprisingly thought provoking.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This was the first Red Hot Chilli Peppers albums I bought, many years ago now.  I relistened to it last night because I've been wanting to put up a review of this great album for a while now.       I tend to nominate albums as \\"Great\\" if they have a few really good tracks [like Midnight Oil's classic \\"10-1\\" or a lot of good songs, like Midnight Oil's \\"Diesel and dust\\" or Metallica's Reload]. Californication gets a nod as a great album for being in the second category.      There are two tracks that I count as very good in this album: Around The World, and the title track. The first has a fast and furious guitar assault and then slows down with some guitar picking. It has some near rap style vocals and a very nice scat vocal section. A highly energetic song.       The title track is more laid back, with some poetic lyrics concerning the influence of Hollywood and the Hollywood lifestyle.        When I first got this album, these were the two songs I repeatedly listened to, and were what probably tipped me into buying the album, having heard them on the radio, and hearing some other nice songs from the album.       As a whole, the album can be described as funky, ryhme laiden, alliterative lyrics, bass prominent music. I suppose that the best of the album is from tracks 1-7. I had heard track 3, Scar Tissue, and it is a nice song, though not the kind of song to compel you to buy this album. Still, it's very pretty, and there a few similarly laid back and mellow songs on the album like this-Otherside, Californication and Road Trippin'.       Get On Top didn't really strike me as a good song first listen, though I did really like the cool guitar sound that it had. Last night, I still liked that guitar sound, but maybe the song is better than I gave it credit for.       Perhaps Porcelain was initially my least favourite song on the album. It's not a very good pop song-not really catchy at all, BUT, I think if you treat it like a lullaby, it maybe not so bad afterall.       Some of the songs have nice, overlapping vocals weaving in and out, like Otherside and Saviour. The latter strikes me as having a Beach Boys flavour-it's a little bit experimental sounding.       Speaking of influences, Purple Stain, whilst not a particulary good song, has the guitar riff out of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love included. And Right On Time features a Beatle-esque backward lyric vocal outro.       Probably my favourite \\"Easter-egg\\" song on this album is Emit Remmus. It's not a lyrically complex song, but its simplicity and catchy chorus is a winner: \\"What could be wetter than, English girl, American man. London in the summertime...\\". Really cool song, and I'm surprised that this is one of the FEW songs on this album which did NOT get radio airplay...it definitely deserved to. Perhaps this song has a touch of The Clash in it.       Other tracks feature nice choruses that you can sing along to, like Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, Easily, Road Trippin'.       Whilst there are many good songs on this album, the album has depth enough to be interesting, even when there are songs that are sub-good. I didn't make any notes last night for I Like Dirt and This Velvet Glove, indicating that they're not particularly interesting to me, though I suppose you could say that some may find I Like Dirt catchy.       So, all in all, a highly listenable album, which is rare, I think. Many good songs, many interesting if not good songs. And a couple of really terrific songs.       My only complaint? The album suffers from 'snap, crackle and pop', which you can hear if you listen on good quality headphones, like I do. For that reason, I'd give the sound quality on this album 2 out of 5.       Great album.    P.S. I've also reviewed \\"One hot minute\\" by this band at this site.  I rate this band as being in the same league as the more pop/rock [as opposed to pop/rock/funk of the Peppers] Midnight Oil. I make an equivalence between the Oils \\"10,...,1\\" and \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\" and \\"Diesel and dust\\" and \\"Californication\\". I give the Oils the edge over the Peppers though.
B000IU3Y1O|4.0|This compilation may seem pretty pointless.  There are two singles compilations from DM right now.  It is most likely that fans already own these.  But some fans maybe a little turned off by the trend of recent reissues, beatifully remastered and packed with extras, but for a price.  Here is a collection of some of DMs best with the remastering and a new track.  The remastering is superb, even if it is not entirely neccessary.  The new track is not really noteworthy.  What makes this collection worthwhile is the DVD edition.  For fans of DM who have bought the prior video collection, there are 10 videos from the pre and post 86-98 period and a new short film.  That alone makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br />For someone who was originally planning to be dissapointed with another best of collection, I was actually impressed with what into it.  The cd has an interesting non chronological sequencing, making it for interesting listening.  It's also a good standalone release for casual fans who want the pure absolute hits and then some without having to buy a number of collections.  The hits are here:  Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, Just Can't Get Enough, and a bit more.  It's not complete and fans will debate it, but for the casual fan, it's plenty.  While I'm not a fan of repeat compilations, this is an OK compilation, made great by the inclusion of the DVD.
B000002HMH|2.0|<br />   I only bought this album because I was such a fan of Reload, the only Metallica album that I consider to be good [it's terrific, in fact] and because I thought it might be similar in sound to Reload. <br /> <br />  I'm not exactly sure how to characterise Load on the one listen I've given it. Reload lite? Reload hardcore? Perhaps Reload is the perfection of the sound Metallica were going for in Load? <br /> <br />  In any case, whilst Load is listenable in the same way as Reload is, it lacks the songs which made Reload so terrific [see my review of Reload at this site]. Another way of saying this is that whilst Reload has many songs that I could envisage being released as singles, Load has none of that quality. In other words, Load lacks a commercial sound. To me, Reload has a poppy, boogie sound, which makes it listenable from beginning to end. It has as many 'hooks' as a good AC/DC album. <br /> <br />   Load lacks these hooks in my view, which is why I characterise it as Reload-lite or Reload hardcore. If, like me, you loved Reload, I would say that you might find Load a disappointing album. If however, you loved And Justice For All and Kill Em All, I'm GUESSING that you might find Load superior to Reload. It's just that I really don't rate And Justice For All and Kill Em All as good albums. What Load has in common with them is the absence of a 'killer' song to shift units. <br /> <br />   All in all, Load is listenable, but lacks songs with repeat listen value like Reload has, or one killer track like mediocre Metallica albums like Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning has [I've reviewed these albums on this board]. <br /> <br />P.S. I've also reviewed the following cds by this band <br /> <br />Reload <br />Master of Puppets <br />and Ride the lightning <br /> <br />as well as Megadeth's \\"Greatest hits\\" cd, a Black Sabbath's compilation and Iron Maiden's \\"Ed Hunter\\" cd. <br /> <br />P.P.S. Here are some songs I consider to be classics of the metal genre: <br /> <br />Metallica: Fade to black <br /> <br />Megadeth: Prince of darkness <br /> <br />Iron Maiden: Run to the hills [though it doesn't have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time] <br /> <br />AC/DC: Hell's bells
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The only negative points on this documentary that I've seen in some reviews here, in other places and in the media as well are that Al Gore shares too much of his personal life and his lifetime important events that might have little to do with the subject of global warming. <br /> <br />I think that almost every reference made to his personal life if taken without the prejudgment of personal promotion is relevant in making this movie more complete and more interesting. It shows his personal journey with \\"the possible climate crisis\\" as he faced some very interesting facts as early as his undergrad years.  <br /> <br />If you carefully connect the points about the attitude shown by politicians and even people in general to the weight example and fog parallelism even the death of the his kid and sister do make a lot of sense on what he trying to achieve. <br /> <br />I do think though that they could have cut a few of scenes just showing Al Gore working on his presentation (moving pictures around) on his apple laptop. With that said it is more compelling to me at least to see the person with a struggle, that should be everyone's struggle, every step of the way than just a scientific documentary with a narrative on the background.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game with the great hope of entertaining and be entertained at the Thanksgiving night. At first no one wanted to play the game, except my 3-year old daughter. I changed the rules of the game so that she and I both could enjoy it. We literally played it as if we were playing Tetris on the computer. She had great fun and so did I. Then my sister-in-law's husband decided to play and we played the two-player version and it was a blast! I can't wait to play with 4 people. I'm sure the dynamics will improve on an already great game.<br /><br />Blokus is a board game onto which tiles of different shapes made up of squares, or units, not unlike the shapes seen in the famous computer game called Tetris. The shapes come in four groups and identified by a different color: red, green, yellow, and blue. Each player starts at a corner and places a shape. A shape can only touch the corner edge of another shape of the same color. Each player places a shape in this fashion until all the shapes are finished, or it is impossible to place another shape. Players do their best to prevent their opponent(s) to place any more of their shapes, while attempting to place all of their pieces.<br /><br />The game between two people takes approximately 20 minutes and decisions made early on bear fruition later in the game to many surprises and challenges.<br /><br />Player with the least amount of units not used is the winner.<br /><br />The colored shapes on the board create interesting mosaics and even have artistic appeal as well as mental gymnastics.<br /><br />This is a very clever game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Well, Well, Well, oh well.....  In a word, *STUNNING*!  I read the reviews today oh boy, about a lucky band who  made the grade. And though the Gallaghers were rather sad,   well i just had to laugh.  They blew their minds out in a car, they didn't notice   though the times had changed, the tunes they thought they   knew so well, just made their music pointless.  No wonder they couldn't get thru the record!    This record is like a RIDE IN A SMALL JET: you're heart   will race, you don't know where the music is headed next.  Revolution defines rock,and is worth the price of admission alone.  The mix displays the awesome creativity of these four liverpudlians,  and like a diamond under a microscope, you discover the true clarity   of these gems.Ringo's drumming shines like a diamond.    Didn't know what to expect, I am blown away by this record   and am anxiously awaiting having their catalogue get this   treatment.     Please George?
0689878451|5.0|We bought this for a child who has two fathers and no mother. Her real father and her step-father are her legal parents. There is no homosexuality in the family. How many thousands of children have the same family structure? I suppose there are many family structures that children live with from the faults of disaster, war, death, disease/disability, multiple divorces and remarriages, migration, immigration, and incarceration. If kids feel better about their homes and families from reading this cute book maybe the bigots can find trouble, suspicion, hatred, and ignorance somewhere else.

B000HC2MG6|5.0|Stop the Clocks deserves the respect of hardcore fans and past fans of Oasis. The band has been making music for the past 12 years, haven't lost their touch, haven't sold out to make pop or rap, and, after 12 years, still revolve around the once-known-to-be fueding brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, the voice and soul behind one of the most exciting and unpredictable bands in recent memory.  <br /> <br />Clocks delivers a retrospective of Oasis's bumpy career thus far. To no surprise, most of the songs, which were all compiled by the Gallaghers themselves as songs that, according to them, encapsulate their band's best contributions to modern rock over the past decade, are from their first two albums: Rock 'n Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, and Slide Away from the 1994 breakthrough debut Definitely Maybe; Some Might Say, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova from the 1995 mega hit follow-up What's The Story Morning Glory. Other classic hits include the UK number 1 hit Go Let It Out from 2000's dud Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, the Liam penned ballad Songbird from 2002's subtle Heathen Chemistry, and the UK number 1 hits Lyla and Importance of Being Idle from 2005's solid Don't Believe The Truth. The boys even manage to thrown in 4 great b-sides, which sound better than most of the singles they've released to date: the brilliantly written acoustic ballad Talk Tonight, the sentimental The Masterplan, the arena rocker Acqueisce, and the stunning Half The World Away.  <br /> <br />The only flaw I find on the compilation is the title: Stop The Clocks is a song Noel has been writing, rewriting, recording and re-recording over the past 5 years; someway, somehow, it would have been nice to have this song included on the compilation instead of causing some sort of confusion, and even misleading some music-goers to the content of the album, but that's Noel Gallagher for you!  <br /> <br />Besides that, both the collection of classics and the band still rock on!  <br /> <br />Recommended  <br /> <br />A
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all.  It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.  If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish. <br /> <br />Thank you Mr. Gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen.

B000HT386M|4.0|It may not have been an Academy Award Winner, but I thought it was very entertaining and enjoyed watching it very much.  It isn't supposed to be a non-fiction film and I think everyone has judged it too harshly.  It is only entertainment and I feel it totally satisfied this bill.  I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again.
B00005JPAD|4.0|Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, The Aviator) returns with The Departed, a gangster thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic), Jack Nicholsen (The Shining), Matt Damon (Ocean's 11), Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights), Martin Sheen (Catch Me if You Can), and a whole lot of cellular phones!    The story is about two undercover spies, one working for gangster Costello, played by Nicholsen, in the police department (Damon), and one working for the police chief, played by Sheen, in Costello's band of low-lives (DiCaprio). What you get is a one helluva twister of a movie. The plot, as simple as it may be, crawls all over you like a snake in the sand pinching you every now and then, making you wonder in amazement \\"What the heck just happened?\\" In the midst of all that, there's a love traingle that evolves between a police therapist and both Damon and DiCaprio.    For a movie that is being hyped up as Scorsese's return to basics, it's not what you'd expect. The movie is fun, but not colossal like Scorsese's classics Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, and his previous film, The Aviator.     Recommended    B-
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I'm a former professional jazz musician and really appreciate what Diana did  in her early years -- her best albums for me are \\"All for You\\" and \\"Live in Paris.\\"  To my ears, the energy is not there anymore -- I think that killer non-stop touring for all those years has used up a lot of energy.  The pressure's off now -- she's married and has children on the way -- that's going to have its effect.  She's just not \\"into it\\" as we used to say.  Anyhow... great talent and has given us some of the best jazz performances I've heard in my time as a jazz player and listener.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Guys don't diss the DVD so much, I mean I know it's a shame they took away THE REAL JABBA; real bummer but other than that nothing else had a flaw and for those guys saying that it won't fit your screen and all that garbage it's absuloutly a lie! Come on!! At first when I watched I saw there was so much more guys in the cantina like this wolf guy and these two lovers; no idea why they took them out. But I was REALLY looking forward to see THE REAL JABBA I mean why in God's name did they take that part out I have been hearing so much about it and they cut the whole seen!! Why?
B000GIXEIG|2.0|Saw this Movie at the actual Premier in NYC and met Sturla Gunnerson and I told him exactly how I felt. Gerard Butler needed a bigger horse. I expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater. Sarah Polleys language was uncalled for in the film. They could have written better lines. The fade in, fade out was like a child filming with a video camera. The film was funny at times and mixed with gore. Like eating sweet and sour. Being a Gerard Butler fan I was distressed after watching this film. Why did he do this? Gerry Butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes. This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera. I expect Mr. Butler to be past these B films and know he does have much better stuff in the works...than goodness. <br /> <br />All in all the film was terrible. The scenery was captivating and breathless. I at times found myself saying wow, but it was about the story of Beowulf & Grendel and it did not meet my expectations that I have read even in the easiest translations. All I can say is Mr. Butler your an incredible talent, becareful what you choose. Movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral. I know Mr. Butler is indeed better than this.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I think Josh's new CD is wonderful!  It's new music, very refreshing after hearing his and Bocelli's CDs for so long which are great, but yawn, so very the same music as other tenors.

B000HEWEJO|3.0|Paramount has issued a great picture but dull sound with pops every now and then in the film and I have noticed certain scenes that have color like the lighting of the Nick's and some of the town lights and light at the end corner part of the screen in the Potter's Office scene. If this is a repackaging of the previous Republic video release were there color segments? I don't remember any. Is anybody else seeing this? Was this always a part of the film and if so, I wonder why I hadn't noticed it before. I have been waiting for a decent edition of this movie but still out of luck but hadn't seen the movie in 5 years since I traded in my previous Republic edition and am stuck with this edition until Paramount or some other studio remasters the audio hopefully similar to From Here to Eternity, Jaws, and Wizard of Oz all of which had original Mono soundtracks and now have Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound as well as the new Bond sets!<br /><br />In conclusion, great movie still poor audio quality.<br /><br />CAP
B000JK8OYU|1.0|First of all, THIS IS NOT A REVIEW ON THE BEATLES MUSIC! <br /> <br />This is how it goes: Back in the sixties, a little kid (Rocky Racoon) just out of his diapers got into daddy's closet and thought it would be fan to mess up BIG TIME! <br /> <br />And that it what has happened! <br /> <br />After listening to this CD I realized that this is like playing with marbles, they can go in any direction and not make sense and this in NOT how The Beatles intended it in the first place. In the original recording the song were so beautifully crafted and brought joy and love to all of us around the world. Yes, the have the love, inspiration... <br /> <br />Listening to this was just a sequence of annoying surprises, pieces Here, There and Everywhere but NONE in the right place. Was this really necessary? <br /> <br />The Beatles`s music IS the greatest in the Rock/Pop World. This CD is some else's playtime... NOT WORTHY! <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie is an album very dear to me...the cover art and the imagery on the booklet, i found this very stunning when i was 14, ten years ago now. I remember vividly sneaking into brothers room to listen to his mellon collie cassette. I was captivated by the track stumbeline, and i began a 5 year infatuation with the band. How couldn't I? <br /> <br />I think this album was the point when the Smashing Pumpkins captured their image most brilliantly, and to a 14 year old they were mysterious, interesting, fascinating, brilliant, and so so so different and better than everything else at the time. Indeed the world realised this, this was a very popular album at the time. <br /> <br />The band seemed to have an understanding of what it was to be the Smashing Pumpkins. To this day i am captivated by the video clips accompanying the singles. This wasn't a shallow garage band, i believe that everything they touched at this moment was magic. <br /> <br />I would disagree with the people saying that too much was crammed on Mellon Collie, and filler, FILLER? Maybe you just want to justify a negative respone. No there isnt any filler, each track is alive with melody, a subject matter, dynamic, beauty. To me each song has it's own life which means no two songs are alike.  <br /> <br />Maybe I'm a bit sentimental but this CD captured a time. I would love to be 14 again and soak in all the imagery and sounds all over again for the first time. Mellon Collie was responsible for me beginning a life long interest and obsession with music. I think music is the best friend you can have, Mellon Collie is my oldest friend.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|I must admit to having never been a fan of any performer, until Loreena.  I have loved her music.  After buying and hearing her latest album, I remain a fan, but somewhat grudgingly.  I am very disappointed in Ancient Muse.  I assumed she took her long sabbatical from recording because she understood that her albums were beginning to have a repetitive feel to them and that she had to detach herself from the grind of creative composition and performance to allow time for her to travel and study in order that she might find a new musical soul.  My disappointment in Ancient Muse is that while very good, it is more of the same, not easily distinguishable from her earlier albums.  In her new album I did not find any sense of evolution or development in her musical style.  I did find a great deal of instrumentation that appears to me to be more filler to an otherwise incomplete album offering in terms of time than a complement to her considerable voice.  I would recommend her new albums, but only to people who do not have her earlier albums, and then I would tell new buyers, as I have, to track down Elemental, which I think is significantly better than Ancient Muse.
B000JCETDS|3.0|This version of \\"PICK OF DESTINY\\", as noted, comes as follows: <br />* A copy of the soundtrack, which is NOT in a jewelcase, but in a cardboard package with the 3-D artwork pasted onto the front (NOTE it is the same 3-D/lenticular image that is also available on the regular edition of the soundtrack) <br />* 8 Tarot cards, each one an illustrated reflection of \\"the genesis of the D\\".  Cute. <br />* A replica \\"pick of destiny\\", plastic-y but nicely detailed. <br />* A cheap fold-out poster - not the film artwork, but a shot of JB, KG and Saskquatch. It's quite small- it is housed in the cardboard CD holder. <br />* A cardboard box to hold it.  <br /> <br />The music-- well we've all waited a LOOONG time for new Tenacious D material (I mean, they've been mainstream since their show debuted in '98 on HBO as a Mr. Show bumper, and this is only their 2nd album!), and personally I'm a bit let-down.  A few of the songs are GREAT, but in total the album is only 35-min. long, and of that probably only 20 minutes are worthwhile NEW material ('Classico' and 'History of Tenacious D' are not new songs).  I'd hoped for more, honestly; I suppose we'll have another 4-to-5 year wait for more material?? <br /> <br />Overall this \\"Limited Edition\\" it's hardly worth the extra $$, in my opinion, unless you REALLY need the replica Pick Of Destiny. The 3-D artwork is the exact same as on the regular (and much cheaper) version, the cardboard case the CD comes-in is just cheap, and the poster is definately nothing special (it's so small I'm surprised they didn't include that in the regular version as well). <br /> <br />All that said-- ooking forward to seeing the flick.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|I have been checking, more or less weekly, for YEARS waiting for a digital release of this version.  I just minutes ago found out about this.  Duh.  All the time I spend searching for complicated stuff and I was unaware of this being available. <br /> <br />NOTICE TO WARNER BROTHERS:  I will STILL buy THREE copies of this when it becomes available on DVD.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|I've seen the defense that this \\"is a soundtrack\\" and isn't the official 2nd-album by The D. And while I can appreciate that line of thinking, the fact is that they've been in the spotlight for 9 years now (since being a Mr.Show bumper in '98), and in that time they've only managed to squeak-out their debut release and... this.   <br />Less than 35-minutes of music, much of it feeling very filler-like, including two recycled tracks ('History' and a revamp of 'Classico').  A fan can't help but feel disappointed. <br />At least the price (esp. here on Amazon) is right.  It's priced just above an EP, and that's about how much new music you get. <br /> <br />I do hope they buckle-down and get to writing a proper new album.  Hearing the genuis that is 'Kickapoo' on this soundtrack just reminds us HOW AMAZING Tenacious D can be when they really put their minds to it. <br /> <br />
B00005JP9V|5.0|Best movie I've seen in ages! No Hollymood mush, just grime and substance. Even the emotional scenes are understated just like real life. Our turbulant times magnified by 10. I've seen some American reviews complaining that elements of the film weren't explained to us but I don't see why the audience need to be spoon fed, use your imagination for a change! <br /> <br />This is much better than V for Vendetta, you'll probably never see another film like it. Hopefully the story will continue...
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|The son of the greatest superheroes the world has ever known, Commander and Jetstream, Will Stronghold is expected to follow in his parents' footsteps and go on to save the world.  On his first day at Sky High, a superhero training academy, he is relegated to the role of sidekick when it's discovered that he hasn't gotten his powers yet.  Though his parents are disappointed, they expect that he's just a late bloomer and that he'll inherit his powers at any moment.  Meanwhile, they'll continue saving the world and Will will continue his \\"hero support\\" classes.<br /><br />Sky High is more or less a live action version of The Incredibles.  Commander and Jetstream serve as real estate agents by day and hang out in the inner sanctum of their basement to relive their glory days.  When Will finally inherits his powers, his parents have dreams of making them the greatest superhero family the world has ever known.  This movie was funny, entertaining, and full of adventuresome moments.  If you liked the Incredibles, I'm sure you'll like this one.  Also, be sure to watch the super bloopers reel in the bonus features section of the DVD, which just goes to show it isn't all fun and games being a superhero.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I don't really care about bonuses or extra scenes, especially when the picture is top notch like \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" The movie was really awesome because it is such a beautiful tale of love and loss between two very complicated men (Heath Ledger played Ennis Del Mar, and Jake Gyllenhaal played Jack Twist. There has not been a love story (released in the US) in the past thirty years that compares to \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" Anyone that appreciates classic cinema will totally enjoy \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" because it is emotional, heartfelt, and very thought-provoking. It's like watching The Titanic, \\" \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and, \\"Johnny Guitar\\" all rolled into one picture, but even better.
0399103422|5.0|This book is in my top 10 list of all time books.  Mario Puzo wrote the mafia book of all mafia books.  To really understand the Godfather movies, you have to read the book.  Puzo is a wonderful writer who lacks nothing througout his book.  His descriptions of the mafia world's layers and relationships is so intricate, but at the same time easy to follow.<br /><br />My favorite story line in the book is the development of Michael from the outsider to the next Don.  Michael is fantastic.  Taking over after Sonny is killed in a retaliation killing he rises slowly and then wipes out all his competition before securing his total reign as the new Don.  This book you can read over an over - and still be entertained.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />JVD
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|Like other reviewers, I had read David Hurwitz's review of this set on [...]. It sounded like a worthy addition to the two sets I already have---Bernstein I and Gielen.    I've been trying to decide how to characterize the set, i.e. what's different from the other two I own. I think its strength is the consistently excellent and musical playing on the part of the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. It sounds like the players love playing Mahler and are committed to doing so with attention to detail and with affection. The sound is excellent.    It's elegant, vital and lyrical playing, and most of the time I find it completely satisfying. But if it's straightforward, letting the music speak for itself, it is also a more Apollonian approach, and sometimes I long for less understatement and more theater. Bertini's more classic style works very well in Symphony 4, for example, but in Symphony 6 it misses the fierceness which is also part of Mahler, and which Bernstein and Gielen face head-on.    But that's the mystery and the pleasure of musical interpretation. No interpreter is perfect, and each brings his or her own strengths and weaknesses to a performance. Bertini's humility contrasts with Bernstein's intensely personal approach.    Overall this is a very rewarding set. Over time one if its greatest advantages may be that one doesn't tire of it as one might tire of a more idiosyncratic set. Highly recommended.
B000HT386M|1.0|Who hasn't fantasized about being able to stop time, with all the fun and depraved stuff you could do? Unfortunately Adam Sandler was not the one to do it. This movie had such promise with this topic and Sandler's juvenile humor, but this turned into the old cliche of \\"you don't know what you have until you loose it\\" scenario. The movie trailer had all the funny parts of the film. This \\"comedy\\" had too much sickness, depression, sadness and death in it, and should have been advertised as such.
B00005JPCD|4.0|This is a movie about a tap dancing penguin who saves his penguin tribe from starvation by finding out that the fish (penguin food) have disappeared because of our overfishing. <br /> <br />1) It's a cute movie - I bought a plushy baby Mombo right afterward. <br /> <br />2) The music's ok - It felt alot like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" in the way it was presented, and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" did the style ten times better. <br /> <br />3) The eco-message wasn't too ham handed - Let's face it, humans do overfish (Grand Banks, anyone?) and if the oceans around Antartica were overfished, it would have a bad effect upon the penguins. <br /> <br />4) How the humans were presented was ok - Just try to tell me that we wouldn't want to save a tribe of tap dancing penguins. <br /> <br />5) Religion got what it deserved - The point about this was that dogmatism without investigation can sometimes prove to be wrong (Galileo, anyone?). <br /> <br />All-in-all a very good, but not 5 star, movie. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Excellent Film! I was already a little environmentally conscious before, but after watching this documentary I feel embarrassed that this man, Al Gore as I'm sure a few others as well have taken the time and dedication to put forth this knowledge to us. Meanwhile 98% of us including myself do little or nothing. I do pledge to myself to take a much more proactive role in trying to save our planet. If it all happens anyway, then well at least I know I did my part.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|I love Sarah's live performance and I realy recommend this album the sound quality is just amazing, buy this remastered and complete version of Mirrorball live.
0345440900|4.0|The E.A.S.Y. helped me understand how to get out of the bad habit of having the baby need to eat (she's really only interested in the sucking) in order to fall asleep (so that I could stop being the human pacifier).  I like how she helps identify when the baby is tired and also tips regarding the pacifier.  I related less to the \\"baby needs to sleep in the same exact way every time\\" since I think it's important for the baby to (if possible) be able to fall asleep in different places - daycare, home, night, day, restaurant, traveling, etc.  but then again, our baby has (so far) turned out to be an angel (at abour 2.5 months).
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I can't think of a reason why you take 2 years of your life remixing an album and making rookie mistakes like the intro of \\"Lady Madonna\\"... totally out of rythm when the piano comes in.  <br /> <br />\\"Here comes the sun\\" and \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" are the best of the album... There are several tracks that can have my total admiration for the work done over them, but there are a few that have some mistakes that could be prevented with simple plug-ins... If you are going to add a Guitar Solo from one song into another song,... you could modify a bit the notes that just don't go with the harmony. The solos everywhere were copied and pasted with no detailed attention... <br /> <br />Overall it's a great job,... but it could have been better.
B000AQBA1W|3.0|I agree with an earlier reviewer who said The Corrs failed to take any risks with this album.  I do however think it brave of them to include two songs in Irish as well as the instrumentals.  That being said, I would have liked the overall sound to be indicative of a pub session or a sing along held at someone's home on a cool summer evening in Kerry.  The band obviously have the roots to pull off such an album, and it would have been nice to see these songs done in such a manner.  My biggest gripe in regards to production is the overly processed vocals that sound very Britney/Christina/Jessica.  Hats off to them for including the Phil Lynott song \\"Old Town\\"--a wonderful picture of Dublin in the early 1980s that is long gone in this post Celtic Tiger age.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This CD is wonderful! If you have seen LOVE it is even more special. I can't say enough about what a great job they did with this CD.  Having seen the Beatles when I was a little girl and seeing LOVE it brings back wonderful memories of both!
0060837020|3.0|Esther, the main character, is a racist, homophobic narcissist, as superficial as she is sensitive, as innocently waifish as she is ruthlessly passive-aggressive, always needing more than the world has to offer. She's an interesting mass of contradictions, but for me ultimately unlikeable, making the first-person narration sometimes hard to take.  <br />The first half of the book, set in New York where Esther is interning or something at a women's magazine, is the most engaging. It's like a cross between Sex And The City and My So-Called Life. She indulges fully in the glamorous lifestyle she is afforded on the company dime, but laments being numb to the experience.  <br />In the second half the narration continues taking a more lamenting than expository tone, ranging in effect from tragically romantic, when she actively commits to her decision to give up on life, to just whiney, when she seems to be demanding sympathy for insensitive or cruel treatment she suffers but does little to combat or avoid. The book seems more like a plea for pity than understanding a lot of the time.  <br />There are a few uniquely effective instances of metaphor and descriptive writing, but many more that are banal enough to encourage skimming, so whatever points Plath earns for vision are lost for filler.  <br />All in all I can't say the book's not interesting, but I can't say I'd recommend it.
0060832819|4.0|I am new to Coelho's books and having recently read (and really enjoyed) \\"The Alchemist\\", I thought I would give his latest work, \\"The Zahir\\", a look. I found this book insightful, thought provoking and spiced with little gems of wisdom. A page turner right up until the climax at the end of the book. Well worth the read.
B00005QCYD|3.0|This Prequel, \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" is good, but \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"The Lost World JP\\" were so much better
B000H30B2C|3.0|After Lord of the Rings I guess I expected more. But what made LOTR the best movie of all time was the source material. And \\"King Kong\\" is not exactly a literary classic. There are some nice special effects but the ape/girl thing is hard to swallow and somehow the movie comes off a bit anti-septic and clinical.  <br /> <br />The old original at least had some \\"atmosphere\\" (albeit with dodgy special effects). <br /> <br />I think LOTR has jaded me. I don't think anything will ever match it in my lifetime.
6304711921|5.0|Jack Skelington rocks!!!!!! Wow I wonder what Thanksgiving Town is like, or maybe Easter Town, Or Saint Patricks Town oh well.
B000002OHX|5.0|My brother surprised me with this album for Christmas back in 1973. I was 16 at the time. Though I had seen the band's records in stores I had never heard them. Of course this album became an instant favorite (and bro I am forever grateful).<br /><br />The best thing is that after all this time this record is still a major source of inspiration. I especially love plugging in and blasting along with Andy's killer lead on Warrior. Damn, what a way to kick off a song.<br /><br />Other faves are Blowin' Free, Ballad Of The Beacon and Throw Down The Sword. Great stuff.

0060920432|4.0|This is a curious but engaging book.  Despite the use of the word 'psychology' on the cover, I would rate it 1/3 psychology, 2/3 philosophy, anthropology, and sociology.  The author's psychological contribution is based on a series of self-reporting tests where subjects were beeped at random moments and asked to record their moods and thoughts.  Lord knows what happened if the beep came during a sensitive business meeting or while making love, the author does not say.  He should have.  Little also is made of the tendency of anyone to respond in accordance with what they feel will be expected of them or will be well received.  This factor and how it was treated should have been debated.  When all that is said and done however, there is an honest and provocative account of what makes for the happiest experiences of (mostly) (western, industrialised, modern) people.  You could also  reframe it as an account of how these same (mostly) (western, modern, indistrialised) people arrive at the state of concentrated and unified attention which throughout the ages has been recognised as the path to paradise.  The author gives in fact fair attention to the Oriental paths to the same result, although he stops short of recognising that the Oriental formulation of the result is meaningful.  The author's knowledge of the philosophical tradition is deep, and his references to it are always refreshing.  A thoroughly interesting read, to be balanced with any modern work on neuro-psychiatry for a satisfying synthesis.

B000FSME1A|5.0|So, there seem to be about two significant complaints with this edition. The first is that the actual films are split over two discs, and the second is the lack of Eleanor Coppola's documentary, Hearts of Darkness.<br /><br />On the first complaint: switching the disks is no big deal. The place selected for the swap divides each film pretty evenly in half, and I find that the division serves as a useful intermission point. Apocalypse Now is such a huge film (original or Redux) that having a brief moment to go get a drink or perhaps use the restroom is a good thing. So, for me, at least, the films being stretched over two discs isn't really a problem.<br /><br />On the other hand, the lack of Hearts of Darkness irks the completionist in me. In retrospect, however, I see that finding a VHS copy for a reasonable price is not difficult. I have not yet watched even half of the excellent special features available here.<br /><br />The video quality of this set is fantastic. I have not seen the film any other way, but the images are amazingly crisp, clear, and devoid of grain or artifacts. The colors are bold and vibrant. The sound is just as good. I had little difficulty hearing what a character was saying, whether they be shouting something in the fray of battle, or whispering something in a terse silence.<br /><br />The menus are easy to navigate, and the special features are very good. In particular, the deleted scenes offer an interesting look at some concepts that never left the cutting room floor. Personally, I felt that two deleted scenes in particular (The Tiger Cages and Special Forces Knife) would have added a lot to the overall value of the film. I'm glad that they are at least preserved for viewing here.<br /><br />While it may be lacking the acclaimed documentary, this is a great DVD set. It allows you to experience two amazing films (the Redux is, if anything, more surreal than the original) with maximized quality. If you haven't seen these films yet, I urge you to give this Complete Dossier a look.et, I urge you to give this Complete Dossier a look.

Props for bringing it full circle, they just might make some kid grab the White Album after reading all of these comparison reviews.

0679735909|3.0|Remember when The Great Zambini appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show? He did this high wire act where he balanced three Golden Retrievers on his head as he juggled seven one-of-a-kind Ming Dynasty China plates and two tailless Siamese cats. In a way, A.S. Byatt's performance is a lot like that. Indeed, there are so many spectacular accomplishments in Possession, that the book has broken five Guinness Book World Records. First, it is the only volume to successfully incorporate all one- hundred and twenty-seven literary forms currently cataloged in the OED. Second, the book contains the largest collection of rare sesquipedalians ever assembled. Third, Byatt is the very first novelist to apply the Charlie Chan movie technique of getting all the characters gathered together in one room for a climatic last scene. Forth, Possession is the first truly pedantic compilation of Baroque literary styles and structures to ever make it to the best seller list. Fifth, on Pages 291 to 295, Byatt, in perhaps her greatest achievement, becomes the first artist to paint a landscape without paints or inks. Her  composition is formed with monosyllabic dabs: brown, black, red, gold (not yellow), green, blue, pale, white, Rose and Blanche. For pure virtuosity, Byatt's new art form, dubbed pointless pointillism, rivals the best of Seurat, Monet, Renoir, Warhol, Zambini, and even the original Great Ventriloquist, Signor Wenchez.
0060977493|5.0|It would be impossible to review this novel without commenting on Roy's unusual writing style.  Inevitably some readers will find Roy's prose to be pretentious and self absorbed.  I found Roy's unique writing style and peculiar wordplay to be a distraction at first, but as I read on I found myself mesmerized by the author's strange, often poetic prose.  I don't know why she capitalizes words that don't require capitalization or why she sometimes puts a period in the middle of a sentence, but after a while, her short choppy sentences develop their own soothing rhythm.<br /><br />The God of Small Things tells the story of a middle class Christian family in India and the events leading up to a tragedy that will change their lives forever.  I found The God of Small Things to be a unique and sometimes disturbing novel, beautifully written.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, The God of Small Things is either a brilliant literary achievement or a self indulgent waste of paper.  I'm with Man Booker on this one.  I highly recommend this unique, richly written, sometimes unsettling novel.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|If you experience a problem playing the DVD of Love, like I did, I have a solution: Switch your DVD player setting to VIDEO out. It seems the producers made this disc intelligent to the point it senses if your player has DVD Audio capabilities. I didn't even realize my Panasonic DVD recorder had DVD audio out. It really doesn't. If it did, it would have seperate RCA output for left and right front, left and right rear, center and sub. I'm confused as to why Panosonic desined it this way. I called Capitol Records, spoke with a recording engineer, and was BLOWN AWAY after I took his suggestion. Go through the players menus and swith to VIDEO output. This will send the video layer to your AV receiver. You should then get a selection menu, including AUDIO SETUP (for Dolby Digital, DTS, PDM, etc.). I did not get this menu initially. Hopefully this helps. The 5.1 is unreal. I'm going to buy a DVD-Audio player ASAP to get the even better experience!!!
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Wonderful <br /> <br />Terry Gilliam is the Orson Welles of our time.  Lambasted by critics for his excesses, admired by others for his genius.  I'm with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while.  Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake & Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.  Check it out!
B00005JPCA|5.0|Bond is back.<br /><br />Before he officially becomes 007, Agent James Bond (Daniel Craig, Layer Cake) is sent to spy on a terrorist cell in Madagascar and then to destroy the man, known as Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who is bankrolling world terrorism in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro.<br /><br />Absolutely brilliant. I loved this film. Signalling a real fresh start for the series, this film is far more serious and darker in tone than the cartoonish Die Another Day, and reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" in the sense of being a welcome reboot for the franchise.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is fantastic, he is not just a good Bond, he IS Bond, closer in tone to Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery, than Pierce Brosnan (with the exception of Die Another Day I really enjoyed Brosnan's films though) or Roger Moore, and has little in the way of quips. He is coldhearted, less suave and quite egocentric and rude, as he's learning the ropes of being an agent at this point before he is given his Licence to Kill by his boss \\"M\\" (Judi Dench), he's like a prototype Sean Connery.<br /><br />Some great action, an early fight on top of a crane reminded me of the climatic fight of 1995's excellent \\"Goldeneye\\" - perhaps the best Pierce Brosnan outing, no coincidence that film was also directed by Martin Campbell.<br /><br />I think the film is a wee bit long (145 minutes is quite long for an action film), and couldn't believe it was a UK 12A (cinema rating) as some stuff was definitely not for kids and quite brutal.<br /><br />I loved the humour in the film, there were some very funny moments that had me laughing out loud in places. I loved the part when the barman asks Bond if he takes his drink shaken or stirred, Craig growls \\"Does it look like I give a damn!\\" sending up a clich&eacute; of the series, or the part when he drove in a circle to get back to his \\"home\\"! What was especially good was how the film could be amsuing without resorting to the groanworthy puns of earlier films.<br /><br />I liked how the character of Bond could be vulnerable though and feel pain (something hinted at in Die Another Day). I think the hero is more realistic if he is not a Superman.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but it certainly keeps you on tenderhooks for the next film.uns of earlier films. <br /> <br />I liked how the character of Bond could be vulnerable though and feel pain (something hinted at in Die Another Day).

B000001EL3|4.0|After the release of the legendary \\"Alive!\\", Kiss went back into the studio to make a great follow-up. That studio follow-up is \\"Destroyer\\". It's hard to say if this is Kiss's best studio album, since their works from 1974-1977 were all great. Whatever your point of view is, this is a true work of art in the KISS catalogue. It's got some of their greatest anthems and their most popular song, the ballad \\"Beth\\". If you've ever bought a Kiss compilation album, you've probably noticed several tracks from this album on there, because there will definitely be at least a few. The only problems here are that because some tracks are so great, others pail in comparison. Also, the fact that Space Ace was M.I.A. in several tracks brings it down. <br />\\"Detroit Rock City\\" 10/10: When I heard the edited version on \\"The Very Best of Kiss\\", my first Kiss album, I didn't know the opening newscast. However, that just builds up the suspense for what is probably the greatest KISS song ever! Strong guitar attack with some cannon drumming! <br />\\"King of the Night Time World\\" 10/10: Although the end is kinda repetitive, this song is a definite feel-good rocker. <br />\\"God of Thunder\\" 10/10: Dark 'n' dirty riff with one of Gene's greatest performances. This song became legendary, pure and simple. <br />\\"Great Expectations\\" 5/10: Sorry, but this is a song that goes in the wrong direction. It has a little bit of a weird feel to it, and that's about it. <br />\\"Flaming Youth\\" 9/10: There are some keyboards thrown in to this anthemic rocker. It's got a cool riff, too, and is one of the better songs on the album. <br />\\"Sweet Pain\\" 8/10: While this is a very good song, the riff keeps going and the chorus repeats itself a little, too much. <br />\\"Shout It Out Loud\\" 10/10: One of the definitive Kiss rockers. Great guitars, bass and drums all the way and the lyrical/vocal delivery just adds to its greatness! <br />\\"Beth\\" 10/10: A sweet and gentle ballad that rounds out the feel of the album perfectly. I'm glad to hear Peter Criss's vocals on this song, as it's one of the few songs he does sing. <br />\\"Do You Love Me?\\" 10/10: This one has a swanky strut of a feel to it, and is all-around awesome. <br />\\"Bonus Track 1, aka Rock and Roll Party\\" 7/10: I don't know what this is, except it's a minute-and-a-half-long track. Paul mumbles the first part but then you can hear him belt out \\"Let's have ourselves a rock and roll party!\\". Whenever I wanna just keep this album running, I let this one play. <br /> <br />Overall: 89/100: This one gets a solid B+ for some really great tracks. However, some aren't as good as others but \\"Destroyer\\" is still an excellent studio album from Kiss. All fans should definitely own this, and all new-comers to Kiss should pick this one up, as it is highly recommended.
1400044162|4.0|As I write my review, this adage readily comes to mind: \\"The pen is mightier than the sword.\\" <br /> <br />This is a book that tells from the author's own perspective, the story of the Nigerian Civil War [1967-70], the story of the subjugation of the Igbos and the genocide that resulted in the name of war. I was amused, horrified, chagrined...The story is centered about the life of Professor Odenigbo and his houseboy, Ugwu, and their lives, loves and loyalties and how these interplay within the political climate of the looming civil war, the mobilization, struggle, and resistance, and its humiliating, albeit \\"inconclusive\\" end. <br /> <br />Adichie certainly did her homework well, and I cannot dispute that. However, I couldn't help but feel that all her major characters, except for Prof Odenigbo and Ugwu, were but mere \\"toys\\", glaringly manipulated to bring out the author's voice. Clearly, I heard the author's voice speak throughout the book so clearly! Sure, it remains a novel, but it is much more. I was chagrined at the unfair manipulation of poor Richard [although, she attempts to rescue him a few times], whose role was, in fact, ambiguous, her sweeping castigation of the West for siding with the Federal government, her undisguised contempt for the colonial rulers, among others. She never really tries to introduce another perspective, if not placating voice, - her voice carries the day. <br /> <br />Personally, I also think sexually explicit scenes were unnecessary in a novel of this stature. They became irritatingly overused and I got the feeling she absolutely needed sex to keep the story moving. And I think that was a big mistake. It simply turned me off. I guess she gambled with arousing that lust for the erotic beneath the human heart. Violence, too, if used sparingly and at the right moment, can create the desired effect. I know the truth must be told, but I really wonder why she depends on so many of these scenes to keep her story moving. <br /> <br />Beyond all these complaints, however, this a good story and the author should be praised for her efforts. There is a lot to be learned from pre-Civil War Nigeria - the clash of culture [Western and traditional (Igbo, in this case)], the vibrancy of the intellectual community, in relative bliss, totally apart from the power intrigues at play during that time. Especially hilarious is the misplaced pride of Richard's houseboy, Harrison, who elevates himself above his contemporaries because of his knowledge of English cuisine, which Adichie conveys in the most hilarious scenes.
B0000029LG|4.0|I never got this CD, but I did see a couple music videos from this album(You Are Not Alone, Childhood, Scream, Stranger in Moscow, They Don't Care About Us).  In the first 2, Michael is clearly pissed off about how he has been treated.  \\"Scream\\" was one of those examples.  This song was a music video from HELL!!!  I was mortified by the video. He is on a spaceship, dancing wildly, screaming, and smashing things, with is hot sister, Janet, helping him out on revenge against the media.  Truly, he is pissed out of his mind in this song.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|First let's get this out of the way--\\"Love\\" is the soundtrack to a show and that's the reason it exists. The bottom line here is that the remixes even if they differ very little from the final versions will make many of these songs feel fresh again to Beatles fans that have heard them a million times. Heck it might even convince someone raised on Nirvana or listeng to Cat Power to give them a try.<br /><br />The best mash versions of the songs on here are truly inspired George and Giles Martin combine the rhythm track from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" with George's \\"Within You Without You\\" to truly stunning effect. The same can be said for \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" and even \\"Come Together/Dear Prudence\\". \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" features Harrison's acoustic demo (which appeared unadnorned on the 3rd \\"Anthology\\") with new orchestration by the Martins. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" features the progression from John's demo, to the first two versions the band cut to stunning effect as well. All of these are highlights of this album. All of these certainly deserve four or five stars.<br /><br />Equally as good are the new remasters of classic Beatles recordings including the first completely true stereo mix of \\"I Am The Walrus\\". While all the tracks sound stunning in either their new stereo masters/remixes or 5.1 remixs there isn't anything new here that a Beatles fan doesn't already own. It sounds a heck of a lot better than the CDs currently on the market for the band (with the exception of \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" and \\"1\\")but it's still the same classic songs. That's not a bad thing it's just that their whole catalog has been due for an upgrade for some time now.<br /><br />Why four stars? The mash remixes are solid throughout (although none as brilliant as \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" or even \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter\\")and the newly remastered tracks sound glorious but I was hoping for some of the mash tracks to be more radical than they are. Regardless hearing the 5.1 remix of some of these classics for the first time makes it a fun listen.<br /><br />Nevertheless Beatles fans will enjoy hearing the familiar strains of classic Beatles songs some altered a lot while others are altered a little. Like the \\"Songtrack\\" release this isn't anything new but will be enjoyed by Beatles fans but can't replace the band's classic back catalog which sorely in need of being upgraded.cks to be more radical than they are.

B000063UR2|5.0|I wanted to see the US version, and i can say that there is a huge differce between tangerine and Mr Goldsmith, certainly his score is much deeper and envolving. <br /> <br />Did you know this movie inspired Shigeru Miyamoto to Create the Ultra Famous Video Games Series ZELDA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00002E233|4.0|The `Deep Blue Sea' released in '99 is an highly entertaining action film that pushes all the right emotional panic buttons and delivers a suspenseful thriller pitting a band of marine scientists against one of mankinds' most feared enemies, the shark.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most about this film was the way the storyline constantly surprised me by taking one unexpected turn after another. Who will live and who will die? Guess all you want, but I guarantee you'll be surprised. Great fun but not for the faint of heart.
B000FGGE68|2.0|Sigh..... such a waste.<br /><br />The ONLY reason to watch this movie is for Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />The special effects were good, but effects cannot carry a movie... well at least not for me.<br /><br />But the story?  Horrible.<br /><br />I've watched it twice, the second time because i had no clue as to what was going on the first time.  And the second time was a complete and total waste as it was.  I'm just glad i skipped this on the big screen.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|What a wake up call this documentary shouts!!! <br />Professional scientists around the world all agree that what Al Gore presents in this film is a very conservative generalization of what's in store for us... most all scientist actually believe things will be even worse!!! <br />Though I was aware of most all of the data presented, I didn't realize just how perplex and intertwined the issues just are (i.e. How most all of the suns rays are reflected back into space when we have ice caps & how most of all the suns rays get absorbed by the water; soon the artic will be open seas during the summers). <br />Only thing that bothered me was that completely crappie, not enjoyable cartoon.  Anywhoo... I'm definitely going to show this to friends and family. <br />I leave by pointing to the facts that have been known now for at least a decade... unfortunately we still have people in this country who still believe the world is flat!!!
B000GPIPSS|1.0|The original negative for DRACULA disintegrated from overuse (over-printing) in the 1940s, so any hope of a real restoration is gone--meaning that there is no adequate source material for an HD version down the road. For the \\"75th Anniversary Edition,\\" Universal took the same mediocre film elements as before and brightened/sharpened them to make the details more visible. Not a good idea because everything looks glary and washed out now, as well as losing all feeling of day/night contrast. The brightening exaggerates the already terrible graininess and print damage of the source material, making it pretty unwatchable. They also re-cropped, re-sized, and reframed the image relentlessly, so the original compositions are no longer really represented. Although no audio fragments are erased like earlier DVD versions, the sound is the worst yet, *very* distorted: you actually need the English subtitles to understand the dialogue. The fascinating (and possibly superior) Spanish version of the film, made simultaneously and also included, was treated better because the original negative survives and it's in good condition, so they didn't have to mess with it so much (though the re-cropping, re-framing, re-sizing, and pannning/scanning are there too). But it's no reason to get this set. The 2004 \\"Legacy Collection\\" set includes both versions and three more films, they all look better, and all the original extras from 1999 are there, the new \\"75th Anniversary\\" bonus features being disposable. I'd go with that at about the same price. Even better, if you can get the 1999 single-disc version with the Lugosi film (the only DVD version with decent audio), the Spanish version, and the extras--\\"used or new\\" on this site, in fact, and cheap (the one with the blue poster-cover), that would be the best solution of all.
B000005GWE|4.0|Why has this album gotten such mixed reviews? I'm not sure, but here's my take.<br /><br />It's not that it isn't very good; it is. But it is an album that requires close listening, and patience. While you might like some of the cuts the first time you hear them, several will take a while to sink into your synapses. So, basically, this music is just not as immediately accessible as much of the work by both of these artists. But my guess is that most people who are fans of either guitarist--or fans of good modern jazz in general--will end up digging this record if they give it a little time. (And if you're a fan of both guitarists, as I am, I can't imagine not wanting to have this album!)<br /><br />A correction to an earlier review: someone referred to Steve Swallow's \\"acoustic bass guitar\\". Ever since he switched from acoustic bass to bass guitar decades ago, he has always played electric basses, as he does on this recording. But it's an understandable error; he has a way of getting a very acoustic sound from whatever electric bass he is playing. Don't know how he does it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I think this version of Solaris is a great film that easily stands among the best motion pictures of its genre. It is not for those with short attention spans, or for those who approach it unprepared to activate a sense of wonder, but for an intelligent viewer, Solaris is a tale that is not to be missed.<br /><br />Others have written icebergs worth of ink on the content of Solaris, so I'll only say that in each of the times I've seen this film over the last half-decade, I have become more fond of it and more impressed. In a medium where loud sound effects are the norm---all the better to reach a population desensitized by an inundation of noise---Solaris approaches through its gripping stillness, and in this quietude it launches one of the more psychologically-perplexing stories in modern science fiction.<br /><br />Who among us has not looked into deep space and been caught up in its mysteries? Who among us has not lost someone we love? And who has not wished for those who have left us to return? Those are the elements of Solaris, a film unique in American cinema.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|\\"Hysteria\\" was huge. Three long years after exploding into the pop culture arena with their album \\"Pyromania\\" and the phenomenal single, \\"Photograph\\", Def Leppard came roaring back, determined to take their music all the way to the top of the charts (where a little album called \\"Thriller\\" had previously kept them at number two).  <br />Yes, their drummer lost an arm. Yes, they went through three producers...the trials and tribulations of the making of this album are well-described in a lovely liner note essay. <br />They came up with a monster album filled with classic songs, killer riffs, exquisite sonics...this album is the best example of the marriage of pop music to metal that exists. Period. <br /> <br />First, the remastering of the record sounds spectacular. Given the density of the tracks here, you can spend hours listening to songs over and over again, finding new little details, or appreciating more subtle touches. <br />\\"Subtle\\"? Did I say \\"subtle\\"? On an album whose first four songs are, in order, \\"Women\\", \\"Rocket\\", \\"Animal\\" and \\"Love Bites\\"? <br />Well, yes. Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange's productions are famous for layer upon layer of vocals, instruments, percussion, noise, samples...and you can dissect each and every one for days. Elegant little synth lines hidden in bludgeoning anthems, or operatic harmonies that seem to fit together like puzzle pieces... <br /> <br />Def Leppard also have a healthy sense of humor and wit. This is a fun record. Again, look at the names of the first four songs... <br /> <br />The record starts off weak, as I have always felt \\"Women\\" to be one of the least interesting things on the platter. \\"Rocket\\" gets things moving; it's an homage to the poppy, glam-rock heroes of their youth. <br />\\"Animal\\" is where the \\"Hysteria\\" sound clarifies and crystallizes. It's a catchy pop-metal anthem, in an era where metal was dark or hidden behind epic explosions of hair and spandex, and pop was often mall-bound and limp. The soaring vocalsof Joe Elliott at the end of the song NEVER gets old. <br /> <br />\\"Love Bites\\" is a rare hard-rock ballad that works, so much so it reached Number One. In fact, rock bands were never considered \\"singles\\" band (for really no good reason), but Def Leppard gleefully slung tunes, one after another, into American Top 40 radio (and MTV) until they themselves were competing with people like Michael Jackson.  <br /> <br />The album went to Number One, stayed for a month and half, and sold, like, sixteen million copies. <br /> <br />Back to the record, we now come to the most totally awesome single. Ever. Dude. Seriously. <br />\\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" is a perfect amalgam of power-pop hooks, crunching guitar chords, elephants-on-steroids drums, peerless sonic production...and a chorus a three-year-old can sing. A song both critics and fans love to love. One listen, and it's back to 1987. <br /> <br />\\"Armageddon It\\" is yet another crisp, thundering rocker, which sounded sweet coming from car radios back then...and still does now. The lyric wordplay confirms the idea that these guys have a lot of fun with themselves. <br /> <br />\\"Gods of War\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" are lesser effors; ambitious yes...just not as successful as the preceding tracks. <br /> <br />The blinding \\"Run Riot\\" gives those thundering \\"elephantine\\" drums a dose of crack, and the result is a happy thrill ride of a pop song. <br /> <br />The title song \\"Hysteria\\" is a justly celebrated, slow rock anthem, composed of seemingly a thousand parts, making another singular epic tune. Crisp guitars, layers upon layers of vocals, great melodies, interesting production effects... <br /> <br />I think the album ends a little weak with the dance-rock of \\"Excitable\\" (which is still at least fun to listen to) and the ponderous \\"Love and Affection\\" (which is not). <br /> <br />All in all, clearly one of the best of that era. One of the best of that genre. One of the best pretty much ever if you care at all about modern popular music. <br /> <br />Now for the extras: The B-sides are terrific, and almost worth the price of admission in and of themselves. In particular, \\"Tear It Down\\" should have been on the album. It's better than four or five of those that made it. The live versions are interesting...Alice Cooper's \\"Elected\\" sounds terrific, but the only \\"Hysteria\\" songs are \\"Women\\" and \\"Love and Affection\\". I hope they are saving the other ones for a subsequent live release. <br /> <br />The remixes are \\"extended\\" versions, but I think the proper word is \\"prolonged.\\"  By inserting long, lyric-less gaps into a song does not make it any more interesting. These are all examples where \\"more\\" is definitely \\"less\\". <br /> <br />The capper is an absolutely bonkers version of 'Release Me'...yes, the Englebert Humperdinck song...with truly  unhinged vocals from the bands' Welsh crew master, Malvin Mortimer. Strange beyond belief, but riotously funny. <br /> <br />So there you have it. I honestly wish ALL classic albums would come out this way. This was really a treat.
B00005AQFC|5.0|One of the best rap albums ever! But, because it was produced by Dr. Dre. Dr Dre is a producing genius. <br />Snoop Dog has never and will never reach these olympian heights again because he does not have the same team and label behind him. Every song on this album is a hit. It's magnificent. <br />Unfortunately, Snoog Dog has sucked ever since. His albums following this one have had the odd decent track on, but have been weak otherwise.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|For a straightforward action sci-fi, its a really good film. I don't know anything about the original toon but this stands on it's own. The plot isn't amazing or anything but at least its not falling apart with holes - you can simply enjoy the movie.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|It sounds like a nice idea.  Let George Martin, the influential producer of the Beatles, loose with the original tapes of the groups sessions to create a \\"mash up\\" of tunes as backing for a Cirque de Soleil show.  All you hear is from the original sessions (except for a string arrangment for one song Martin especially created for this recording).  How could you go wrong? <br /> <br />In the liner notes, Martin talks about the process of creating the mix and compares it to creating a film soundtrack.  Taken as individual songs, there's some wonderful classics here, some presented pretty much in their original form, others using components of several mixed together.  But as a listening experience as an album, it's enjoyable and rather forgettable.  It just doesn't hold together musically and feels like listening to a backing track that would accompany a dance performance, which is basically what this is.  It's the same thing that keeps most film soundtracks from working on their own as a full-length album; musical passages and the order of the tunes is dominated by the needs of the film or the performance and just listening to the material without the visual references makes the music sound a bit disjointed. <br /> <br />This isn't an album I'd get out for a listen too often except to marvel at the clarity and 5.1 mixing of some of the classic songs included in this audio collage.  Ultimately, it just makes me want to have the Fab Four's original LP's finally remixed in high resolution audio for mono, stereo and (where possible) surround - all the issues so far on CD have used the \\"mix down\\" tapes used to master the vinyl albums.  \\"Love\\" simply makes this need to upgrade the Beatles full catalogue to the DVD-Audio or SACD format that much more apparent.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I used to think Global Warming was a myth, now I think otherwise but there is one flaw the media misguides the American and world population on. They make you think the weather is somehow going to tilt wildly like it did in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. That is a big misconception. Case in point with the Hurricane patterns as of late, they blame global warming on them for being so strong, not true in a sense because those patterns go through cycles like what we are going through now it happened in the late 1950's- early 60's. And general climate, I was reading a review from here about a person talking about how the weather wasnt the same now when she was a child. Climate does the same thing also, remember we had The Dust Bowl and every year the leaves are not going to be spectacular color that is just the way mother nature intends it to be. It's always going to be different every year. I will say this about the movie Al Gore did a whole lot better than I thought he would. I remember he used to be so robotic when talking in public or on stage. He has come a long way in 6 years.
B000002KCC|5.0|This is the best Neil I've heard. It's hasty, it's sloppy, it's depressing, it's drunk and stoned, it's borne of tragedy and despair.    In other words, it's great rock and roll.     If you can't feel Neil and Crazy Horse kicking your a** with \\"Come On Baby, Let's Go Downtown\\", you really don't like rock and roll, do you?
B000H7JCIW|5.0|Like her legendary mother, nobody around today takes command of the stage like Liza Minnelli and this legendary event at New York's Radio City Music Hall clearly illustrates this...always a five star event in concert, I have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and I am here to say that she has still got it and always will!!! In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!!
B000DWMN2S|4.0|I've been a fan of Elijah Wood since he was a little kid, but he isn't the reason to see this film. His performance is understated to a fault. Other flaws include a score featuring Ukrainian folk/pop which gets annoying, and a very slow start, and an ending that makes the audience sad. However, the virtues greatly outweigh the misfortunes. This tale of an American Jewish accountant who hires a cut-rate tour guide in the Ukraine to search for his grandfather's World War II village and the woman who helped him escape the Nazis turns out to be close to wonderful. The Ukrainian guide and his own grandfather and their dog are hilarious companions, and that's the best part of the film. It achieves a rare feat...many laugh-out-loud moments in what is essentially an uncovering of a tragic historical event. Eugene and Boris, as the traveling companions, steal the movie from Elijah, and their dog almost steals it from them. Rent this, have patience with it, pay close attention to it, and you will have treated yourself to nearly two hours of thoughtful story-telling. Thanks, Jim Clark, for recommending it.

B00005K3NY|2.0|...with LSD in order to enjoy this movie. As many have said, the idea is interesting. Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well. <br /> <br />Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all.
0743289412|1.0|Well, I finished the book and the only stars that should be given should go to me for slogging through 500 pages of mindless plot, idiotic and repetitious sayings, and an unwavering idea that King was trying to make me feel sorry for him for everything he has to \\"endure\\" for being a famous author.      I have been a King fan since the mid-70s and was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new book.  Like others before me, I got the book, ran home, got snuggled down for a good King read, and prepared to lose myself for a couple of days.  Well, by page 50 I was fed up with all the cute sayings and pet names Lisey's family had for the everyday things in life; I also got tired of having to look back in the book to remember what 'SOWISA' meant; and I got tired of reading \\"smucking, smucked, smucker\\", whatever.      I long for the days of King when he was writing such greats as \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" \\"It,\\" and, of course, \\"The Stand.\\"  I'm just huh-yoogely glad I got this smucking book from the public library rah-cheer rather than buying it; it was a smucking waste of time.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm not going to write a review in which I espouse on the merits of each track, detailing the virtues of the thumping beats, retro synth stylings, and unbeatable dance grooves.  What I will say is that it has been a year since this wonder came out and I am still finding new sounds to love about it. I listen to it all the time and even heard the melodic tones eminating from a neighbor's window this morning.  You will listen to it over and over again.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|Even if somebody could out-Beatle the Beatles, it would never sound entirely legitimate anyway. <br /> <br />Giles Martin has done an admirable feat splicing together numerous Beatles bits and bobs. At times the mix is a mess, most often when he tries to mash one tune with another. The results are more enjoyable in the juxtapositions. The most brilliant moment? The way \\"For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\" runs into the end of \\"She's So Heavy\\". Heavy! John would have been tickled pink. <br /> <br />Altogether, a fun listen, but nothing you'd ever really get into. And that's what we're looking for in music, isn't it?
B000JK8OYU|2.0|oh yoko you did it again. I love The Beatles, but what has been done in this CD is unremarkable.
B00065MDS6|5.0|Please understand that I came upon King Crimson just as Crimso Mk. I was laid to rest, in 1973 or so. I was a lonely, too-sensitive fifteen-year-old growing up in Alabama, and newly in love with prog-rock. I \\"learned\\" the King Crimson oeuvre chronologically, starting with ItCotCK, then ItWoP, then \\"Lizard.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Islands\\" had just been released that very year; KC broke up immediately after the conclusion of the \\"Islands\\" tour, and I therefore had missed my opportunity ever to see them live--or so I thought. <br /> <br />Having put my POV in context, please know that upon first hearing I knew that \\"Lizard\\" would be my favorite of all the KC Mk. I albums, and so it remains to this day. There is truly no accounting for taste, of course, and I am sure that mine is the decidedly minority view, but the opinion formed in my sixteenth year is concurred with in my fiftieth. <br /> <br />First, \\"Lizard\\" is saturated with jazz fusion - another of my musical loves that lingers to this day. Many of the \\"sidemen\\" on the album, including Mel Collins and Keith Tippett, continue to produce experimental jazz, and they never sounded better than on this record. The complex, interwoven layers are, in fact, much more dense than what groups like Weather Report and Return to Forever were laying down in that era, and I would suspect that even the grand-daddy of Fusion, Miles Davis himself, was probably impressed with the complexity and breadth of \\"Lizard\\" (though I have no way of knowing this). <br /> <br />Half of the album (Side Two on the original vinyl) is a \\"concept piece,\\" and the remainder is a loosely conjoined bit of psychedelic free-association that hangs together just as well. The sound is even more dense than the Mellotron-saturated first two albums, yet so much more sophisticated. <br /> <br />\\"Lizard\\" appears to have been a \\"perfect storm\\" of sonic bliss. The following offering, \\"Islands,\\" featured most of the same ensemble - and has some flashes of the same brilliance- but is nowhere near as satisfying (and in fact, is the weakest of the four early Crimso works). <br /> <br />The hell of it is, even after KC was resurrected in 1974, with \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" (and the KC Mk. II era that would last to nearly the end of the seventies begun), it was obvious that the \\"Lizard\\" sound would never be heard again. It remains like a prehistoric insect in fossilized amber, and shines just as brightly. <br /> <br />Thank goodness for modern audio engineering and the wonderful world of the \\"Digital remaster.\\" \\"Lizard\\" never sounded better, and I highly recommend it to anyone dedicated enough to King Crimson to procure the very best the band has to offer.
B000001DQG|3.0|When a Rock superstar launches a Mega-hit album like \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" (as a double LP, in addition) what to do next?... Quite difficult!  With \\"Caribou\\", EJ tried to keep his lucky star in the heights of success. However, the album falls short to be the logical sequel to his previous masterpiece. Anyway, it is an album worth to give a try. \\"The Bitch Is Back\\", \\"Pinky\\" and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\" are genuine EJ superhits. But \\"Solar Prestige A Gammon\\", as well as \\"You're So Static\\" and even \\"Stinker\\", are an exercise on a different EJ. Strange songs, but hey, if you expect to listen the same tam-tam-tam and tah-dah/tah-dah/tah-dah on every record you get from your favorite artist...
B000000Y2R|5.0|This concert from 1955 is a \\"must have \\" for anyone interested in the history of jazz.This is something of a time capsule - an impromptu concert in Toronto by the individual winners of a jazz poll.No rehearsal - they just turned up and played. <br />This is all about \\"bebop\\" and reeks of late 40s New York : Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie playing a mixture of Gillespie compositions ( Salt Peanuts ) and standards such as A Night In Tunisia and Perdito. <br />The rythm section is Bud Powell,Charles Mingus and Max Roach and the standard of playing overall is breathtaking.The sound is actually pretty good,considering that this is a 50 year old tape recording. <br />A treasure.
0618680004|5.0|The book was wonderful. I was already a Dawkinite before reading it, and I remain so afterward. The vast majority of his arguments were well-thought, well-written.  <br /> <br />He just made sense.  <br /> <br />Claims refering to his so-called bigotry and lack of tact/style are entirely inane, not to mention Red Herrings. My jaw dropped when I saw someone dismiss his work simply because he wasn't nice about what he was saying, as if the style of one's speech can discredit the meaning of the speech.  <br /> <br />Ridiculous. Style has no bearing on the strength and validity of his arguments.  <br /> <br /> <br />I heartily recomend this book for individuals who want real answers provided within the scope of british wry humour.

0452285186|5.0|I leave this out in my living room and people inevitably flip through it and laugh a little.  It's not a *book* by any means.  It's just a collection of drawings featuring the ingenious ways depressed bunny rabbits think up to off themselves.<br /><br />And heck, it's about time someone dealt head on with the whole \\"suicidal bunny\\" issue, isn't it?<br /><br />Bravo to Riley for so heroically bringing this formerly taboo subject to the forefront.<br /><br />It's a very random, very irrelevant bit of fluff.  It won't cure world hunger, it doesn't propose new ideas to hedge global warming, it can't nurse an ailing puppy back to health.

B00005JPCC|5.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />How did James Bond become a \\"00\\" agent? What makes him so good at his job and so distant to the beautiful women he often encounters? Wrap your mind around those questions and then go and see director Martin Campbell's latest Bond flick, CASINO ROYALE. That someone could pull off such a fantastic film whilst giving us the Bond-background is something of a marvel. Leave aside (for the moment) that Daniel Craig isn't as debonair as previous Bonds, and you just may enjoy Casino Royale on a level never before seen.<br /><br />It's simply a fact that Craig isn't the dashing, clean-cut, and uppity Bond audiences have come to expect. He's rougher, tougher, and a bit naive. He loves instead of lusts. He learns to kill with a conscious (in the beginning), but still delivers pithy lines (\\"That last hand nearly killed me.\\")<br /><br />The question of James Bond's beginnings have always been in question and Casino Royale gives them to us while also delivering the action, a few gadgets, a kick-butt automobile, and the curvaceous women we expect.<br /><br />Director Martin Campbell first cut his teeth on a Bond film with GOLDEN EYE in 1995, so he knows the lay of the land. He also went on to direct the stylish THE MASK OF ZORRO in 1998. From there his repertoire stammers with several duds, but came back in glaringly fine fashion with this year's Casino Royale.<br /><br />From the opening credits with its flashy and somewhat retro poker card graphics, to the black-and-white film stock beginning, audiences immediately realize they're in for something special. We quickly watch Bond make his first two kills, granting him access to his 007 status. Then we get to see him nearly ruin his career by causing an international crisis. From here he's sent on hiatus by M (Judi Dench, MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS) to get his head together. But of course Bond never lets go of an assignment until it's finished. Continuing his international crisis across borders, he travels to a tropical island where he meets up with terrorists who are trying to advance their causes by selling bomb-making material. He meets up with one of the racketeers' wives in true Bond fashion. But the British Secret Service have their eyes on him and quickly find out what he's up to. They are forced to go along with Bond's plans to enter into a high-stakes poker game with the evil Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen, EXIT), a facially scarred and blood weeping villain who recently lost a ton of money because of Bond's interference in his \\"business\\". If Le Chiffre wins the $120 million game, he'll have enough money to get back into supporting bombers and bomb-makers.<br /><br />Bond also happens to be The Service's best card player, but he has to convince the penny pinchers of the British government that he's got a good chance of winning or they'll refuse to back him (if Bond loses the British will, in effect, be sponsoring terrorism). Enter Vesper Lynd (Eva Green, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN), a government finance agent who agrees to give James Bond the money to enter the tournament. As the cards fall, so does Bond's chances. As all appears hopeless, Bond wins the tournament, thus crushing Le Chiffre's chances at re-entering terrorist haven, and threatening his very existence because he's lost all of his financing given to him by the dark forces of the world (they'll obviously want their money back at some point and now Le Chiffre is broke). Obviously Le Chiffre is none to happy about Bond winning and kidnaps him and Vesper.<br /><br />By now Bond has grown very fond of Vesper and they form a relationship unheard of in terms of Bondom. He confesses his love for her and eventually (after a dizzying and testicularly funny escape from the clutches of death), agrees to leave the Queen's Service in order to live a life of love and happiness with her. But all Bond fans know this cannot be. A sense of terrible foreboding grips the film as Bond learns the true nature of Vesper.<br /><br />It's wonderful to see how all of this effects James Bond and how it coalesces to help form the Ian Fleming character we've all grown up with. Vesper, through Bond's love of her and her betrayal of him, helps turn James into the tough-loving, womanizer we all know. This betrayal also lets us see why James Bond doesn't trust anyone and prefers to work solo.<br /><br />So Daniel Craig being a bit rougher around the edges in appearance actually fit the script nicely. He IS rougher. He IS tougher. And he IS the Bond we've come to enjoy.<br /><br />(Note: Caution to all those who get this when it comes out on DVD. There is another comedy film entitled CASINO ROYALE starring Peter Sellers, so make sure you're aware of which is which.)re of Vesper.  <br /> <br />It's wonderful to see how all of this effects James Bond and how it coalesces to help form the Ian Fleming character we've all grown up with.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|When I first heard about this release, I didn't even think about buying it.  After reading all the positive reviews here on Amazon, I was pursuaded to buy this album.   <br /> <br />I was expecting some grandiose remixes, some completely mind blowing material, with songs completely rearranged.   <br /> <br />Although I didn't grow up in the 60's listening to this band, I grew up with their music...their songs were taught to us in elementary school, and I've never stopped listening.  So I fashion myself a Beatles fan, maybe not a Beatlemaniac.  But I know the source material well enough. <br /> <br />After listening to this \\"new\\" album, I came to the conclusion that this was not nearly bold enough.  The hype surrounding this has been completely overblown.  I understand what it is...A Cirque Du Soleil soundtrack.  So why not package it that way?  It is packaged as \\"The BEatles like you've never heard them!\\" <br /> <br />The potential was there for this album...but it seems as though the Martin's didn't want to step on any toes whilst making this album.  If you're going to tamper with this holy grail of pop music, you can't do it half-hearted at 50%.  A few overdubs sprinkled here, some rearranging there, an alternate take mixed in...that just doesn't cut it. <br /> <br />All of these songs are pretty much intact, as they were...With new interwoven intro's and outro's...the meat of the songs are mostly the same.  Alot of things they tried simply didn't work.  The string arrangement at the beginning of \\"Octopus's Garden\\" doesn't fit musically at all.  Just an awful job.  When the song finally kicks in, it is excellent.   <br /> <br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is the obvious highlight of this album.  The intro sounds a bit forced, and you notice the cut-and paste job, but I guess it works.  The rest of the song is brilliant. <br /> <br />The sound of the album is the only redeeming factor.  The vocals are vibrant, crisp...and makes you wish they'd digitally remastertheir whole catalog of music.  \\"I am the Walrus\\" sounds absolutely stunning. <br /> <br />This cd isn't the worst CD I've ever bought, but it left me wanting more.  More creativity, and more boldness.  They could have gone in a million different directions with the source material.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure who this cd was made for...The hardcore fan or the new listener?  The two camps who oppose or support tampering this music? <br /> <br />To me, they didn't do enough.  Does that please the purists?      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The entire \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy is absolutely amazing and all are groundbreaking achievements in filmmaking but in my opinion they wouldn't be as good without the amazing master work of composer Howard Shore. 'The Return of the King', in particular, has the most expressive, emotional and dramatic music of the three films which perfectly complements the emotion and drama of the movie. The music alone is a work of genius. From the orchestral music to Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\", this soundtrack is truly astonishing.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I was very hesitant to see this film when it was released in theaters. I was raised with Christopher Reeve as my Superman, and that was that. I enjoyed this movie when I realized this was a new Superman and a new take on Superman. It's kind of the same mentality with \\"Batman\\" -vs- \\"Batman Begins\\" Same characters, but a whole different movie and a different concept. You can't put them together and expect to be satisfied.<br /><br />With Superman Returns, you can't put it into the lineup of the original Superman films of the '80's. Instead, this new Superman deserves a whole new fan base purely based on its own merit as a truly enjoyable film. They did a good job on this movie, and it shouldn't be marred by the expectations of us old Superman fans.<br /><br />Superman Returns really evokes emotion out of you and I found that the characters were a bit more true to who they really are. Lex Luther was played very well by Kevin Spacey, and I found that I didn't love and laugh at Lex Luther, which is the way it should be. He's a villain, you can't like the villain (i.e.- I always found Gene Hackmans Lex Luther to be hilarious and funny) Superman Returns has a very real dark element to it, it seems more realistic. Superman himself was played very well and instead of being a campy \\"Can Do!\\" superhero, he came across to us as a real guy, and I liked that. Lois Lane as played by Kate Bosworth is pretty ho-hum, as I think they could've done a better job on the casting. A 98 pound 22 year old isn't a very convincing choice for the part of the strong minded and strong person that Lois Lane is supposed to be.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a great film, but take it for what it is and enjoy it as a whole new Superman film rather than a sequel in a series.

B00004U8P9|1.0|What an absolute utter piece of garbage. There's a reason why this motion picture...and I use that term loosely in this case...failed miserably when first released. Because it's God-awful and stupid. It was only after many years of playing as a 'midnight movie' that it finally made any money. Even then, the show was frequented by high school drop-outs, hippie wanna-be types and other losers who had nothing better to do than try to act like the idiot characters on the screen. Jeez....not even 'I Spit On Your Grave' or 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' were this bad.<br /><br />With a sincere apology to Tim Curry, who is an otherwise fine actor, but here, he is just one VERY ugly alien transvestite singing silly songs. And his name...Frank-N-Furter? Ooooh...how original. I wonder how many functioning, non-drug addicted brain cells it took to think that up??<br /><br />If this film is your idea of a great movie, well, all I can say is that you have my sympathies......
B00005UW7G|3.0|I recall viewing Losey's interpretation of Don Giovanni back in the late '70s at the movies in suburban Adelaide, South Australia.  It struck me then that this what opera should be - drama and music without the limitations of stage.  This is still a wonderful interpretation of this work but the quality of the sound and vision on my DVD is awful.  Is there no way to resurrect the original?
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's voice has never sounded as dreamy as on this compilation, infused with delicate winter melodies of comforting warmth.<br /><br />Her new take on \\"What Child is This\\" is surprisingly refreshing and she gives new appeal to many classic renditions to capture your awareness of the intrinsic beauty contained in each song.<br /><br />\\"River\\" is filled with romantic longing and desires for simpler times...\\"I wish I had a river I could skate away on...\\"  This song brings out the ecstasy in Sarah's voice.  The blending of modern and classic songs works fairly well because Sarah maintains the mood with soft soothing vocals and highlights of music that never overwhelm the mood.<br /><br />\\"In a Bleak Mid Winter\\" has acoustic elements and lyrics setting a modern yet romantic mood. The final track is breathless and compliments all the elements of this album as the mood is set for listening to this again and again.<br /><br />The entire album makes you want to get out some eggnog cookies and apple cider and read a cozy novel or write Christmas cards. A winter candle may be essential...a fireplace or fireplace DVD...most definitely!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000002UB6|4.0|Plagued by the Beatles' inner turmoil and Phil Spector's occasional overproduction, it's amazing that \\"Let It Be\\" (1970) turned out as well as it did. The record has a rough-edged charm and sounds more group-oriented than \\"The White Album.\\" Though the Beatles didn't hang around to clean up the post-production mess, they certainly didn't disgrace themselves. \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" \\"One After 909\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" remain memorable tracks - while George Harrison's overdubbed guitar solo on \\"Let It Be\\" is preferable to the single release. Unfortunately, there never will be a definitive version of the \\"Get Back\\" project. The 2003 \\"Let It Be. . . Naked\\" has some punch, but the throwaways of \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It\\" were omitted, along with the studio chatter. As a result, the reconstruction sounds hollow compared to the original album.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I heard this CD playing in the Sundance Music Store in San Marcos, TX. and just had to have it!  It is Cale and Clapton at their best and a must for all fans of both idols.  This road is worth traveling down.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I really enjoyed the performances by Peter Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even Jamie Foxx deserves credit for the work he did in Jarhead.  <br /> <br />I do not normally like Jake Gyllenhaal. It is not that I dislike him at all, in most of his roles I have simply found him unremarkable. He brought a passion to Jarhead that he has not had the ability to display in previous movies. He has come a long way since Bubble Boy. <br /> <br />I like Peter Sarsgaard. I have liked him in pervious parts and I appreciate the complexity he brought to the character in Jarhead.  <br /> <br />Not too long ago I could be heard requesting the end of Jamie Foxx's 15 minutes of fame. More often than not he plays a relatively transparent character and he does little, if anything, to bring the parts to life. (Granted, I have not seen Ray, so I am speaking only of his other work.) If he continues to bring the maturity to future characters that he brought to Jarhead, I will gladly eat my words.  <br /> <br />I liked the way Jarhead, in a subtle fashion, portrayed different types of Marines. The movie primarily featured the enlisted son of a proud veteran, the cowboy Marine who can't wait to kill anything and everything, the man with the haunted past trying to lose himself in the Marines, and the firm-but-fair, almost fatherly, commanding officer. There were many other men and women who fought and participated bravely in the war, but these characters were the focus of the movie.  <br /> <br />I liked two main themes/symbols from the movie. I found it very interesting the way the movie suggests that soldiers are coached on how to address the press when expressing their opinions on the war. I also enjoyed the contrast in one of the final scenes as the veteran Marine joins the young men on the bus. This scene was brilliant in its awkwardness.  <br /> <br />(I was a little disappointed by how similar boot camp experience with the drill sergeant was to the beginning of Full Metal Jacket, but it may not bother you at all.)  <br /> <br />I approached Jarhead very objectively and found myself very pleased with the movie. I had no expectations, lofty or otherwise. I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was. The language and some subject matter may make the movie prohibitive to a younger audience, but I believe Jarhead is an important movie for the respect and appreciation of our armed forces.
0812975219|5.0|With one essential concept in hand, Nassim Nicholas Taleb takes us on a tour of our vanities. The idea is asymmetry, as in the notion that less of a greater mass can be greater than more of a smaller mass. Take a cancer screening. If the rate of incidence is 1% in a population of 10,000, and a test designed to determine presence of cancer will affirm this for 90% of those who indeed have the cancer and 1% of those who do not. If one has an affirmative result, what is the probability you have cancer? Experiments have shown the bulk of laypeople and a disconcerting number of statisticians and doctors answer \\"90%\\" incorrectly. The number of people with positive results includes both the incorrectly and correctly labeled groups. The number correctly labeled are 10,000 x (percentage of population with the disease) x (% tests will correctly identify these) = 10,000 x 1% x 90% = 90. The number incorrectly labeled is 10,000 x (percentage of population without disease) x (% tests will incorrectly identify these) = 10,000 x 99% x 1% = around 1000. Thus 10 / (10 + 1000) = about 1%. The recurring cognitive bias that causes this error is the attending to probability (90% vs 1%) instead of expectation, the probability times payoff (10 vs 1000). <br /> <br />As Taleb shows us in biological and economic climates, this mode of thinking leads us astray. Just as the well-dressed talking heads breathing numbers in succession repeat the words bullish or bearish, we do not bother to say \\"but how much?\\". Content is important to Taleb, perhaps the most refreshing part of this walkabout is his reminder now and then that we really ought not to be be impressed with those made wealthy fromt he markets, since extreme success has a greater likelihood of coming about due to noise than skill. This especially hits home when Taleb's musings reminds us wealth itself is not as interesting as, say, essay-writing and contemplating Homer. In a world driven by power laws (the 80/20 rule that describes distributions of the bulk of wealth among percentage of population, as well as size/use of words, population/number of cities and more), network externalities (each additional node to a network makes the network more valuable, Microsoft is used because other people use it), asymmetries matter, particularly if they are mostly attributable to chance and confabulated by those Taleb describes as charlatans: the media pundits and economists, the opiates of the middle class (\\"normative economics is like religion with the aesthetics\\"). <br /> <br />The problem is induction. These asymmetries show up again in the role of the black swan problem, which has profound implications for epistemology, what we can know. Hume's perception that even if we observed a man for a thousand days and observed he did not die, it would be improper to take finite data to create a law that \\"this man will never die\\". We can never truly estabish the causal mechanism that would allow for us to induce laws like these, because any observations we make could still be wrong down the road, and all the while at best we perceived correllation. The assymmetry arises when one could take a thousand white swans to have whiteness as a rule and all this data would be upset by a single black swan. Thus countervailing evidence can be disproportionally devastating, and indeed, be highly illuminating in unpredictable ways. One could concoct a dozen coincidental explanations to why swans must be white, but the presence of a different colored swan would have one scrambling to narrow down the possible mechanisms for producing color in swans. <br /> <br />What Taleb holds is that what's true for markets is true for minds. He sees the persistent misconceptions about the capacity of economists to explain data and traders to turn consistent profits as stemming from our cognitive biases. Thus leads him to go so far as to claim Kahneman and Tversky, who illustrated basic cognitive biases that completely contradict standing assumptions of neoclassical economics, as the two greatest influence on economics in modern history. Taleb's reading of the behavioral economic literature is incomplete, for instance, it leads him to assume persistent losses are psychologically less painful than an equivalent single loss. Dan Gilbert has shown that we possess a psychological immune system of sorts that prevents large gains or losses from having long term effects on our happiness, but small frequent gains and losses figure prominently. But he shows that a handful of these cognitive biases have profound effect when combined with a mystical reverence for the dogma of statistics (more information is better) and our faith in those that have training in repeating these assumptions to us as fact. The style of these essays is exploratory, and determined to explain by dint of logic rather than \\"proved\\" quantitatively. Taleb is honest in his appraisal of the capacity of mathematics to explain, and since narrative is still a powerful way to seduce coupled via induction, it is appropriate to weave a story for us. <br /> <br />It's a delightful story, particularly because we are marinated with Taleb's idiosyncrasies, sometimes off-topic, often trivial but always memorably written. His respect for skeptics like Montaigne, who declared \\"I am myself the matter of my book\\" is apt. Taleb, who actually refers to his origin as Levant, is romantic in his passions, he would prefer to call himself as a professional skeptic. He is a wonderful chimera, and this charming book serves as an invaluable primer on enjoying the spectres our mind produces as spectator.
0743289412|1.0|...I really tried. I had such high expectations.  I got the book the day it came out, I ran home, put on my P.J.s, grabbed a cup of coacoa and closed the blinds.  After slogging through the first couple of chapters, I got up, threw open the shades,  got dressed and went to the movies.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|\\"Love\\" will probably be the closest thing to a new Beatles album that I will see released in my lifetime.  I was born about a year before John Lennon was shot.  After discovering the Beatles, in my early teens, I felt like I'd been denied something extraordinary.  Here was a man who could sing very well, write great songs, and perform them in such weird ways.  I have never, to this day, heard anything as bizarre and full of ideas as the White Album.  Maybe it was the time when they were making the albums, but I doubt that was all.  The Beatles' albums show me how to make great art.  You can't make it in a vacuum; you can't always make it alone.  The Beatles were a group of talented individuals, coming together, to make something special. <br />  <br />With \\"Love\\", George Martin has proven himself as an essential member of the band; that is, if there was any question of that to begin with.  The Beatles were great at experimenting in the studio, but it was always Martin who formalized those experiments.  It was Martin who, during a lunch break, recorded and sped up an organ for the solo in \\"In My Life.\\"  It was also Martin who recorded a different and, in my option, much more focused outré to \\"Glass Onion\\" (for evidence of what it sounded like with Lennon's cut, please refer to the version on Anthology 3).  Martin made sure that, no matter what instrument was used, what process it took to get a particular sound, it still came out sounding like a good pop record. <br />  <br />Here, we have the songs deconstructed.  \\"Glass Onion\\" is an experiment as daring as \\"Revolution 9\\", but with a beat.  \\"I Am the Walrus\\" is in full stereo, making it more disorienting (for this song, a good thing).  \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" is three songs in less than two minutes.  These songs are ingrained in our DNA; we hear them in the grocery store.  We hear McCartney playing them at the Super Bowl.  For Martin and son to bring out the original inventive spirit in which theywere created, lo those many years ago, is an achievement. <br />  <br />If anyone wondered who decided all the vocals should go on one channel and the guitars and drums on the other in those songs on Rubber Soul and Revolver, I think \\"Love\\" proves Martin is that man.  In the 5.1 mix, the vocals are prominent on the center speaker, while the instruments are often panned hard to the left and right.  The two rear speakers are used for ambience, and the occasional surprise.  This makes me happy.  The best part of the recording quality of a Beatles record is that you can hear the discreet parts of the song.  Each instrument, each person clapping, even the occasional stray studio sound can be heard.  The listener is the one who makes a recording complete, and in the case of the Beatles, they knew that and created songs that reached out for completion.  This is still the case with \\"Love.\\" <br />  <br />This album should be remembered for two main things.  The first, more prosaic item is that this will hopefully show how to make an album in 5.1.  You can use multiple speakers and not have a wash of sound (or even a wall of sound).  You can isolate tracks in speakers and still have them fit in with the larger sound.  It's an impressionistic approach to mixing - sit next to one speaker and hear one part of the song, but step back and hear the whole thing.  It's a good trick.   <br />  <br />The second reason this album should be remembered is for the people who made it.  The Beatles showed us all how exciting it can be to create.  Their songs resonate to this day because you can hear the people making the music, can actually feel the joy that went into each track. <br /> <br />It is an exceptional combination of artistic talent, craftsmanship, and technology that brings us \\"Love.\\"  As is always the case, it takes the most effort to reach the simplest truth.
0375703764|5.0|My daughter gave me this book and insisted that I HAD to read it.  I flipped through it and put it on the bookshelf convinced that it was one of those things she thought I would love,  but ultimately I just didn't \\"get\\" like Trauma Center, the Wii, and the musical stylings of ClosedEyesTakeLives (if you enjoy the screaming more than singing music - you should definately look them up).  But I digress, House of Leaves turned out to be the most interesting book I've read this year. The story, and the format, (Darren Aronofsky meets Edgar Allan Poe) is innovative.  I can see where the margin notes and reverse writing could be distracting, but don't be discourage, it IS worth the effort.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Great Album!  Sarah has a pure, beautiful voice and sings these songs well.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The alum is, perhaps, a touch on the melancholy side, wistful, maybe even a little sad.  Still, I loved it.  My favorite track is \\"River\\" - which I finally discovered (after all this time) was written by Joni Mitchell.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|Just when you thought that there was no hope...when the best you were ever going to get was mud...something like this SACD gets released.   I had bought this album in four previous formats: LP, dbx encoded LP, CD, and the 1997 Remastered CD.  Until now, the 1997 CD was the best of the lot, but the 5.1 mix offered here absolutely blows it away by a huge margin.  I must have played \\"Lovely to See You\\" fifteen times and I still can't believe how good it sounds.  This is how the MB's meant it to be heard.  Wow!  A big 5 stars plus for the 5.1 mix on To Our Children's Children's Children also.
B000JJ4GW0|4.0|U2 got it right with \\"U218 Singles,\\" which is THE definitive \\"best of\\" collection (or \\"singles\\" collection, since this isn't technically a \\"best of\\" ... are you confused already?). I recommend simply buying U2's albums, but for the casual listener, this is a good place to hear some of their most famous music. <br /> <br />Of course, questions always abound. Why did they stop with 18? Why not go all the way to 20? That way they could have included \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Discotheque,\\" two hard-to-miss singles in their catalog. I don't know why U2 insist on ignoring \\"Pop,\\" which is one of their best records, but I guess it's their prerogative. At least they didn't remix any of the songs from that album as they did on \\"Best of 90-2000.\\" <br /> <br />I agree with all of the selections here, though as I said, they could have grabbed one or two more singles along the way. And the track listing is just about dead-on perfect. (\\"New Years Day\\" sounds great right after \\"Vertigo,\\" for example.) Sure, you could create your own \\"U218\\" via downloading, but as a compilation album, this one does justice to the material and the listener. <br /> <br />The two new tracks are outstanding. \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" rocks; it's not some phony corporate pairing of a couple of popular rock bands (Green Day being the other), but a passionate, soulful performance. And \\"Window In the Skies\\" ... it took about three listens to grow on me, but I really think U2 (Bono in particular) did a great job with it ... sort of a throwaway, but a very nice melody that could easily have been composed by John, Paul, George and Ringo. <br /> <br />I bought the deluxe version which includes the concert DVD. Another sterling live performance from the boys, this one in Milan, Italy. My favorite rendition would have to be \\"I Still Haven't Found,\\" though it's awesome to see Bono whip the crowd into a frenzy during \\"Elevation.\\" My only complaint is \\"Original of the Species.\\" This particular performance of it doesn't work. With the string section, the song threatens to turn into a Barry Manilow moment. I would rather have seen \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" from this show ... or just about anything. <br /> <br />U2 albums are always interesting visually, and this compilation is no different. The booklet features dozens of Anton Corbijn's typically brilliant photos of the band from throughout their career, and the lyrics are helpfully reproduced along with release dates and cover art from each single. <br /> <br />Does \\"U218\\" represent an \\"artistic decline\\" for the band? I don't think so, not on the basis of the two new tracks, which are as strong as anything they've yet done. Did they do it for the money? Doubt it, not with the Vertigo tour continuing in Australia and New Zealand. Contractual obligation? Maybe, but we could have gotten a lot worse than this effort. I think U2 are doing the smart thing ... consolidating their most popular work into a single album for new fans and casual listeners. I have no problem with that at all. At least they're still alive and making relevant music. <br /> <br />Still the best (as well as the biggest) band in the world!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I found this movie to be highly entertaining as well as interesting. Following up the original movie, this sequel fitted perfectly and followed the original movie very well. I found Kate Beckinsale both believable and quite alluring in her role. While she doesn't fit the \\"action female\\" persona, Beckinsale does a creditable job. This movie goes into the history of the struggles between the vampires and the werewolves. Its tell a good story and within the frame of the this tale, the movie work pretty well.<br /><br />The movie got slammed dunk by many critics who may take themselves too seriously. Many movies of this genre suffered from professional critics who often write like snobs instead of looking into the such movie and taking it for what it is. Of course, it probably don't help that many critics really don't like this genre despite of their public statements.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed the original movie, you will definitely enjoy Evolution. Its well acted, well supported and script reads very well to support the frame work of the story. Like many other reviewers, I would say forgo the critics on this one and listen to those who enjoyed this sort of film.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is great. In the begining I didn't think this band would be as  <br />huge as they become. They are slow putting out albums, but when they do their quality.
B000002TQB|4.0|Hailed by many as Blur's best album, \\"Parklife\\" was my first sampling of them. After many years of being a huge fan of 90's alt/rock, I decided to check this band out. What do I think of this album? read on...    I was familiar with the first song on this album, \\"Girls & Boys\\" from seeing the video on Vh1 classic late one night. This song was the reason I got the urge to check this band out, a very catchy tune. The album continues next with \\"Tracy Jacks,\\" and the comparisons to the Who and the Kinks come to mind with this certain song. \\"End of the Century\\" is one of the albums highlights. This song should be up there with the likes of Radiohead's \\"High and Dry.\\" The next song, \\"Parklife\\" is more fun brit-pop, I'm not much for spoken word, but this song comes through with its catchy chorus.    The next four songs bring down the album just a tad bit, \\"Bank Holiday\\" is a quick punky song. \\"Badhead\\" is a great mellow song, but it seems out of place between \\"Bank Holiday\\" and the instrumental \\"Debt Collector.\\" \\"Far Out\\" is a short, more experimental song. I like this song, it reminds me of the psychedelia of Syd Barret, and early Pink Floyd. Its a shame the song is so short.     The album picks up again with \\"To the End,\\" this is easily one of my favorite songs on the album. Its a very british song, and I love the chorus. This song has a more epic feel, which I like.     The rest of the album is hit or miss. \\"Clover Over Dover\\" is one of my fav's from the album. More of a downer of a song with its depressing lyrics, and thats what I like. \\"This is a Low,\\" the longest song on the album, and its many peoples favorites. I have to agree because its a very well written song, and its a good way to close out the album.    Blur's \\"Parklife\\" was better than I expected, and I'm ready to dive deeper into Blur's other albums. It's a great start if your a blur noobsause like me.     Blur's \\"Parklife\\" - Final rating: 77%
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this movie as a requirement for school.  I had no idea what it was about going into it, all I knew was that it was a foreign film.  So it hit me very hard after leaving the theater.  I was, to say the least, caught off guard.   <br /> <br />The first half of the movie is lighthearted, funny, sweet with Roberto Benigni shining (he just makes you love him).  Without going into the plot which can be read up top, the second half of the movie is set in a Nazi concentration camp.  Which is, of course a subject that is not funny at all.   <br /> <br />Benigni didn't make this movie as a historical documentary (to those that may argue that the story is unrealistic).  As viewers we are spared the horror of what the camps may have really been like for the sake of the true intent of the movie which in my opinion is to show how a father spares his young son the reality of where they really are, out of love and through laughter and imagination. I might make it sound hokey but the whole package is genius.  <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a lovely movie but don't expect lighthearted comedy. It's very bittersweet.  (for lack of a better word) There are some truly sad parts.  One of my all time favorite movies....I had tears streaming down my cheeks when I left the theater.
B000J103X4|5.0|i'm not saying this is will be the album of the year, but so far it  is way better than Jay-z and Snoops albums. i only wish if g unit and the game could reunite or work with Shady not even aftermath becasue i don't think dre is that good anyway, and that is why tupac wanted him fired from death row! overall my fav songs are Scream On EM', CA VACATION, Let's Ride, One Blood, Bang and Compton. rest of the songs are good too. i think the only album that might be better than The game's album could be the Re-Up.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|It's just a fantastic season long arc interrupted by just a few standalone episodes. Great, great space opera stuff.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|No matter what side of the political fence you are in. No matter what you think about the environment. \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is a movie you MUST see. After we saw the movie, which depicts Al Gore doing a slideshow presentation about the current situation and outlook of the global warming crisis, we scratched our heads at how careless we can be about a topic that our very survival as a species depends on.<br /><br />The movie gives hard data in a visual way, that is compelling and easy to understand, showing how bad the current situation with global warming is, compared to our entire past history. It goes on to elaborate in terms of particular geographical areas, how they are doing today and their outlook in case certain (not too unlikely) environmental events unfold. It presents the US in the context of the world, what we are (not) doing about the problem, and most importantly, it gives lots of tips of things we CAN do, to make a difference, along with directing viewers to the movie's web site: [...].<br /><br />There is no way that you can watch this movie and not care about this issue afterwards. All you need to do is get yourself to watch it.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|I did like the Three Cheers album, in fact I liked every single song on the cd.  The Black Parade is basically the same thing.  In every song I find myself being reminded of a song on the previous cd.  This cd is extremely similar but has less diversity.  If you already own Three Cheers, I wouldn't waste the money on Black Parade.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|If you like the Beatles you might not like what has been done to their music on this album. I liken it to one of those K-tel brand album collections where you get hit songs sung by someone other than the original recording artist. Yes this is the Beatles but they are \\"one off\\" - you'll know what I mean when I hear the album.  <br /> <br />I know that is the point but it could have been so much better rather than the \\"Disneyfied\\" approach they took. I believe that others have done more with the music (with less cooperation from EMI). Ultimately a CD that is doomed to collect dust.    <br />
0618680004|3.0|I use \\"Atheist Taliban\\" here to sarcastically refer to British author Richard Dawkins. In his book, \\"The God Delusion\\", Dawkins expresses his case for atheism. More correctly, he spends the considerable majority of this book attacking religious beliefs. His approach appears to be, rather than make a case for or defend his atheist position, it is better to attack the case for religious beliefs. <br /> <br />Dawkins' attack includes multiple references to \\"American Taliban\\". He uses that disagreeable title on multiple occasions referring to Americas' Christian religious right. My point is: the Taliban that governed in Afghanistan was a most ruthless and vicious organization that committed atrocities of degree and quantity. Although the American religious right has some violent elements in an extreme minority, its comparison to the Taliban has no legitimate grounds. Thus, this rhetorical comparison amounts to no more than a classic \\"straw-man\\" position, and it weakens the authors attempt to be considered a thinker of importance.  <br /> <br />The other flaws in this book are: regular criticisms of positions of Bush, Blair, and others that the author disagrees with (no value toward the topic), and poor examples intended to buttress a position statement left a sense they were merely filler material. Again, little or no value toward his main position was served by these intellectually lazy comments: apparently he just couldn't resist preaching-to-the-choir. <br /> <br />Most of the arguments for the atheist position here are well argued and properly stated. There are also many examples of social issue examination, and comparing those issues to religious practice and biblical phrases. These comparisons are engaging many times, but the effect of the name-calling (e.g. American Taliban) and intermittent condescending leaves me with the impression that Dawkins true audience is the committed atheist/liberal, whom will simply cheer him and smile as if in a campaign-trail audience. <br /> <br />There are important criticisms of Islam also, especially exposing the motivations of violent fundamentalists. Dawkins quotes from Sam Harris on several occasions, and frankly I highly recommend Harris' book \\"The End of Faith\\" instead of this book. An even better understanding of the violent Islamic movement is found in \\"Civilizations and Its Enemies\\" by Lee Harris.  <br /> <br />The other reviews have expounded on the positive aspects of this book. That side has been satisfactorily expressed. My review has intended to provide a completion to the reviewing profile. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is an easy read: very few deep philosophical discussions here. Those discussions are general and well done. The book is aimed at a pop-culture audience in America and Britain, and is designed to hit a few nerve endings and stir up introspection and reconsideration of ones religious tendencies. (Although I doubt that many religious believers will even pick it up.) Less rhetoric and it would have been a better book. <br />
B00005Q4CS|3.0|The contradiction in reviews is easy enough to glean from the various comments. There is such a concentrated dose of graphicness and extreme feelings of depression conveyed from these, that the viewing will automatically trigger feelings of disgust from the average or normal person. I do not blame those who feel this is a five star film, but the other extreme seems pretty unfounded. On the other hand, I find the raves hard to believe. This is a wonderfully produced, deep, well-acted movie. A true psychological thriller. Ellen Burstyn is truly outstanding. Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a versatile actress. Overall a very above average film with a limited degree of appeal to most people. Well worth seeing once, and I would recommend teenage viewing for the shock value. This review is regarding the directors cut.
B00006GA4C|4.0|Great album.Great recording?No.Great guitar tone?To me,yes.To most people,no.But like a good friend once told me rock and roll isn't SUPPOSED to sound that good.This is a raw recording with raw playing.That's what I love about it.Pure high energy hard rock.I always loved the Detroit bands from this era(MC5,Stooges,Amboy Dukes,Frijid Pink)and this record really captures that spirit.This is not\\"We're An American Band\\" Grand Funk or \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" Grand Funk.This album makes their later stuff sound like the Carpenters.OK,not exactly.Just buy it and play it loud. <br /> <br />
B000093BDX|5.0|This is an awesome CD. I actually grew up listening to these guys. My mother listened to these guys whenever we were either cleaning the house or just to relax and have something fun to listen to. I really didn't like borrowing my mom's Beach Boys CDs, so when I saw this one at Kmart in Grand Forks North Dakota, I knew I had to get this one so I can have my own Beach Boys CD. I also remember watching the episodes of Full House these guys were on (I still watch those episodes when they are on as well), now after an episode of Full House featuring the Beach Boys, I always pull this CD out of my CD case and listen to it. This is really a fun album!
0393061434|5.0|This is a great geek book. <br /> <br />The book is written in very colloquial style and could easily be titled \\"a long chat with Woz.\\"  His style is straightforward and frank, and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing about his experiences growing up, building Apple and beyond. <br /> <br />Steve's approach to life is very methodical, and it was interesting to see how he mapped the learning experiences that led to the creation of the Apple II.  Shy an awkward, he articulates the struggles that many nerdy types faced growing up.  I loved hearing about his hippie years. <br /> <br />Determined to always figure stuff out and passionate about doing things efficiently (elegant designs), he got a kick out of that \\"Eureka\\" moment, as he calls it, when a problem that has consumed one's focus for ages finally works. <br /> <br />My favorite part of Woz's story is how he does not take himself too seriously.  He was a prankster at heart (I've always postulated that the engineer is a social animal).  More than once I laughed out loud while reading about the pranks he pulled.  <br /> <br />Woz's intent is clear in the book, he wants to set the record straight, there seem to be many rumors about Apple, him, Jobs, etc. that have become \\"fact.\\"   Most importantly he wants to encourage innovation and the Engineering profession by sharing how much fun he had being an Engineer.  After reading the book you can't help but feel like you know the guy.  Thanks for sharing Woz, great book.
0385493622|5.0|Engaging story on its own, wonderful book for the intelligent individual who is unfamiliar with 'serious' math. I found it riveting and am looking forward to re-reading it so I can step through the math more rigorously.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|You heard me! This movie sucks. Everything about it is stupid. This film is disgusting. It is polution to your mind to watch this. Stay away.
0375505091|5.0|We've always known that Annie Leibvoitz can create an arresting photograph.  With this volume she roots herself in the body of her other work, creating something immeasurably richer.  There are few single volumes of any photographer's work that rise to this level. Thoroughly rewarding... <br />
0618680004|5.0|I have just finished reading The God Delusion and I am very impressed with this book. Professor Dawkins articulates is reasonings and arguments very well, very powerfully and very convincingly.<br /><br />I admit that I am something of a fan of Professor Dawkins and I have read most of his books and I look forward to every new book by this scientist.<br /><br />Needless to say, many religious folk are working themselves up into a lather over this book and probably most of these people have never and will never read this book. Some of the reviews here on Amazon reflect some of these not quite sane and preposterous reactions. I suspect that many of these reviewers have not read Professor Dawkins' work!<br /><br />However, if you're interested in learning about the atheist stance on the question of believe in deities, this book is an excellent starting place. If you're an atheist, agnostic or religious, this book is worth reading. You may not agree with the conclusions of Richard Dawkins [I admit that I found it hard to find fault with any of his arguments, not that I was particularly trying to do so, I just went into the book with an open mind.], but you will find the way he sets out his ideas very interesting, passionate and, indeed, entertaining.<br /><br />I am hoping that this book is the harbinger of a new Age of Reason / Age of Enlightenment in the 21st century. There was a lamentable rise in silliness, foolishness and mumbo-jumbo in Western societies in the last quarter of the 20th century. Let us hope that that period in now over and we start dealing with the real (and amazing!) world again!
B0009K8L5W|5.0|This was Shakira in her pure rock best long before she got commercial.  This along with Donde Estan Las Ladrones were her best work.  Listening to Estoy Aqui you can hear snippets from other rock classics as her later American hit Underneath Your Clothes seemed to take its beat from Aerosmith's Dream On.  Shakira is Baranquillera, from the same city as my family.  She studied guitar with the same woman who gave my son piano lessons (taping his fingers to keep them straight).  Shakira rebelled against the bayanato classic sound of Colombia to mix Lebonese sound with classic American Rock and nowhere does she do it better than this disc.  I hope one day she comes out with English Language version of these songs so American audiences can appreciate these brilliant songs!
B000JLTRKE|3.0|a movie about 2 men trapped in a pile of rubble.  This movie sumarizes the events of......9/11? Hmmm.  Um.  Well okay, but weren't there more than 2 men trapped in a pile of rubble that day?  More people trapped on the higher floors who had to jump from the building?  Okay.  Well in this movie about these 2 men they become trapped in rubble and help keep each other alive.  They are trapped in a building.....what?  The World Trade Center?  Hmmm.  I don't remember....AH!  Yes now I remember, sorry folks I forgot about the 30 second shot of the Towers, my bad.  Alright.  It also deals with what there families are going through and how they react to the situation.  Curiously, it doesn't show anyone else in the rubble or anyone else's families in pain.  <br /> <br />Wierd.  Very wierd.  It makes it seem as if this day of tradgedy and horror was only expierienced by a few and not by many, that is why in my eyes this movie fails at what United 93 did.  United 93 did not try to hide the horror or make us feel a certain way, it gave us the facts and left the rest up to us.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This is an excellent first English Language disc by an artist who was already well established in the Latin world.  The rock sounds are here especially with Underneath Your Clothes, which sounds a lot like Aerosmith's Dream On.  Those of you who enjoyed her superior prior works (Pies Descalzo and Donde Estan Los Ladrones) may be a little disappointed in the commerical direction that this one went (take the pop candy song Whenever).  Also some of the English lyrics are really non-sensical and we are not sure what the title Laundry Service has to do with anything on the disc.  This is what prevented me from giving the disc 5 stars.  Shakira has a good sense for great sound and music is her strong point over lyrics.  But her Lebonese roots engrained in many of her sounds gives her music a unique feel to it that will keep her as a megastar for many years to come!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I have, for a long time now, been a hearted fan of Yanni's work and I was fortunately enough to assist to his openning presentation of this concert US tour and still  today my companion on the occasion and I treasure that concert as one of our most memorable experiences. It has been a mile stone in our lives ever since. When the presentation ended, we left the arena in a complete silence, hand in hand, as if we were still holding in that grasp all the unexplainable emotions experienced while the music and the lights were rushing within us through our eyes and ears. That is why when this DVD came out we gave one each as a present and a token of remembrance. I simply recommend this production to any music lover.
B000063Y8F|5.0|We've owned the Rosle Garlic Press for a few months now and each time we use it, we cannot stop raving about how easy it is to use and to clean up afterward. We cook a lot of dishes which call for minced garlic and this garlic press has made this chore so much easier! Our kitchen won't be without one ever again!
B00005JPBD|2.0|<br />creo que es la peor peli de almodovar entre las 6 que yo vi. yo digo desgraciadamente porque quiero mucho como un brillante director a pedro. pero esta pelicula me aburre muchisimo. menos mal que yo pude aguantar hasta al final.... <br /> <br />ehhh, tambien es normal que los \\"espectadores\\" pseudo-authenticos que han empezado a ver a las pelis de almodovar despues de \\"todo sobre mi madre\\" piensan que es una peli authentica de almodovar. yo me rio. <br /> <br />pues muy mala y aburrida. para el favor de las pelis anteriores yo di 2 estrellas. pero \\"authenticamente\\" daira 1 sola. <br /> <br />
B0009A40ES|5.0|This film is stylistically and visually stunning. One could imagine that transferring this book to the screen was no easy task while retaining its essence. Yet it is done in this film literally to perfection. <br /> From the casting, sets, mood, cinematography, lighting, acting, everything is superb. <br />  <br /> This is the film that propelled Christian Bale's career and you can see why. Handsome with an immaculate body yet pulsing with menace. He manages to project the subdued brutality necessary for the part while relying on very few tricks. The way Bale as the lead deceives everyone around him with his soulless conversation is creepy beyond words, especially since you're in on the 'gag'. When the character finally pops, the film gives the violence its due. Holding back would have hurt the film and the director wisely chooses for the full bore approach. <br /> <br /> The mark of a great film to me is one that seems to breathe with its own life. Where you have no doubt in your mind that this world exists somewhere and you believe you could step into it. That is an excellent description of the world American Psycho inhabits. It is simply an excellent piece of filmmaking.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Jean Reno does the Dirty Harry (burnt out cop) schtick better than Clint, whether it's in an action flick like the Crimson River series or Ronin or in a comedy such as Wasabi you can count on him to deliver a character that's credible, imposing and soulful.
B000083C49|5.0|A lot of fun is to be had with this installment in the Star Trek movie series. There is nothing like watching people from the future travel back in time to around this time period and try to interact with people of the past. That is exactly what this movie is about as Kirk and the crew go back in time to the late 20th century to retrieve some whales that are extinct in their future. Obviously, this movie is hilarious, which is what is intended. But, this also teaches us a leason that we need to be more careful on what we do now because it does effect our future.<br /><br />The story really does add the comedy touch to what could be considered a serious topic of whale extinction. There are many moments that Trek and non-Trek fans alike can enjoy just because of the fun nature of the entire movie. From Spock swimming with whales to Chekov asking actual people who didn't know they were being filmed where the \\"nuclear wessels\\" were. If you are a fan, you have to see this movie. This is a must have once again for anyone who loves great films.
B00006G8HX|4.0|While maybe not as good as the Wrath of Khan, this story offers a great conclusion to this two part story. The only let down of this film is that Leonard Nimoy as Spock isn't seen until the very end of the film, which may discourage some fans that they didn't get enough of the Spock they know. But, the story makes up for any loss of the film and the age progression of Spock actually makes the story even more intersting.<br /><br />This film also marks the debut of Leonard Nimoy directing a Star Trek movie, and he is makes a great director. The most bizarre thing about this movie is that it features Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon. As funny as it may seem and even appear when watching for the first time, he actually made a pretty intersting and convincing Klingon and enemy. There is a lot of drama that takes place in this movie as well as another known character is tragically killed. Overall, another great installment in the Trek movie franchise.
B00005JNS0|5.0|\\"Cars\\" is the inventive, creative, and entertaining animated film of the year.  Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides.<br /><br />The characters' witty names reflect their personalities and help with screen play motion:  \\"Lightening McQueen\\" (Bullitt and the Cooler King would've driven this racer), \\"The King\\" (Petty's Superbird always grabs my attention!), \\"Tow Mater\\", etc.  This movie is brilliant and funny.  Your entire family will enjoy this DVD.  Your little ones will, especially, like it.<br /><br />I always prefer the wide screen version, but have also watched a friend's full screen \\"Cars\\".  Both are great.  If you want good clean fun, with a poignant moral at the end (honor, loyalty, and friendship are more important than winning, fame, and money!) then \\"Cars\\" is the fun-flick for you.  Race down your DVD soon!<br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Although a stylized version of the book, this is a thoroughly fun and enjoyable movie...if not just for the visual beauty of the scenes, costumes, etc, but for the wonderful performances by all actors. This is a true \\"feel good\\" movie that I watch often, especially when feeling down...it's for all those who are romantics at heart. I'll even admit the ending (near ending really) always makes me cry, sigh and wonder where all the \\"Mr. Knightlys\\" have gone. :)
B000JJS8TM|5.0|We have all rated things with 5 stars before but that doesn't quite give this disc justice though. This is a stand alone at the top of the mountain disc!!! A trip down memory lane in DVD-A with the Boys is what it is. What a fun time my wife & I had listening to this gem. <br /> <br />If you have a car with DVD-A capability you will not be disappointed. It plays perfectly. <br /> <br />6 Stars!
B000HT3P7E|2.0|I love this show.  It's one of the best written and best acted sitcoms in years.  I've been anticipating this box set since CBS mailed the pilot on DVD to select magazine subscribers. <br /> <br />Imagine my disgust after finally purchasing the box, and discovering that Fox decided to only release it in pan and scan format, literally costing us a third of the action.  There is no excuse nowadays for releasing a DVD of a show shot in 16:9 HDTV in 4:3 format.  If you want to get a copy of this series, either track down the widescreen versions, or wait for Fox to come to their senses and release this set done correctly.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|Great music - on an old fashioned CD player. Forget listening on your computer, or exercising fair-use rights to listen on an MP3 player. The music is great but the medium is severly limited. I normally boycott crippled content like this - I never pirate music, only pay the price for those who do and who have caused the record industry to keep its customers in straight jackets.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!
B000JK8OYU|1.0|In my opinion, the Beatles Catalogue should be left alone and not suffer from such remixes.  At times the voices sound out of tune and this detracts from the overall listening pleasure. <br /> <br />With the amount of media hoopla surrounding each Beatles release it is difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff. In this case, sadly, it is chaff. Disappointing and definately for Beatles fans ONLY.
B000I5X824|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this group and their Greatest Hits album.  Just when I think I know their music well, they continue to evolve and grow to levels that totally amaze me.  Aaron Lewis' voice is without a doubt one of the best in rock music ever.  His talents as a singer and song writer are totally mesmerizing and combined with the instrumentals, the sound is both haunting and intensely beautiful. Anyone thinking of purchasing this album should do so.  Their music will be around forever.
0393061434|3.0|The colloquial tone of iWoz makes it very easy to read, but the content is lacking. Don't get me wrong, he seems like a heck of a guy, and a great engineer, but the book falls short of his past accomplishments. Most chapters are dry - they are chronological and outline his development, but they don't offer the reader much motivation. By the end of book, I felt like I knew Woz, but I wasn't any better off myself.<br /><br />Woz stresses his love for logic and, apparently,  honesty. Perhaps myself and Woz have different definitions of 'whitehat' and 'blackhat'.  In my dictionary - lying to police, phone phreaking and faking company product flyers  hardly passes under a honest person. They were 'just pranks', but they  left me wondering.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being too critical, Woz does offer some good advice: projects are part of learning; patience is key; follow your instincts; see things in grayscale. His story is interesting, but I didn't leave my hands scratching to go out and start a project myself.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I make no excuses. I am a fan of Il Divo and proud of it. These men are not a \\"boy band,\\" but a quartet--and a well-matched one at that. It's been a long time since I've heard music like this, and I never expected to hear it in the Pop genre.  <br /> <br />\\"Siempre\\" is just as beautifully done as their past efforts, but it's also quite different--more up-tempo songs and things you wouldn't have expected. I usually reserve this time of year for Christmas music (Il Divo's \\"The Christmas Collection\\" is also exquisite!), but I'm going to have a hard time this year because I am in love with Il Divo's rendition of \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?\\" The criticism that they need new material is unfounded. There are several new songs on this album--the hauntingly beautiful \\"Come Primavera\\" comes immediately to mind. Also their version of the John Miles favorite, \\"Music,\\" was completely rewritten for them by the composer himself.  <br /> <br />If you liked Il Divo's past albums,you will love \\"Siempre.\\" If you haven't yet discovered these young men, do yourself a favor and give them a try. They are truly phenomenal.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time in years last night. Great for all the stars, the \\"swinging sixties\\" atmosphere and the great music(made me think of my late grandparents and their Herb Albert albums!) I'm glad I read the other reviews about Sellers walking out and all the production problems--that explains alot about the plot problems and why Sellers character was killed off before the conclusion. Still a really fun film I enjoyed as much now as 25 years ago. After watching Peter Sellers performance I have no doubt Mike Myers thought the same. When Sellers(with his nerdy/hip looks and thick black glasses)took off his shirt and exposed his hairy back all I could think of was Austin Powers! + The scene in the first Austin Powers with Bacharach's \\"The look of Love\\" was lifted staight out of this movie. Obviously a big influence. GREAT FUN. I WOULD BUY A COPY
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Trying on this new suit may initially make you feel like you may need some new shoes to go with it.<br />You may find yourself first turning to the side, and seeing how it looks in your mirror, or imagining yourself driving in it, with the top down.  Perhaps you found yourself pulling over to the curb and listening to the bawling rain, warming up your hands before you headed out into what has become a  brawling storm, and when you did, found yourself  with no road, and gripping that shifter as tight as you could, you felt every bump in that road.  We've been  out on that road, and many years ago found ourselves out to the end of a pier in the worst rainstorm of the year, when the wind blew the rain sideways and right through us, grinning madly...I'll never forgot that day, and I will never forget Mr. Waits, who has saved me from this world many, many times.  Some stories may take you for a ride, but these will leave you with a heart pinned to your arm.  And if you have to go, will you remember that we do belong here, and have been asked only to be true, and when we get out, we may find that Tom has slipped a couple of his parking tickets in our pockets...not a bad deal after all.  The seven LP box set for Orphans has just been released, and it is a gorgeous massive tome of print and sound that loves to be hoisted into one's lap. It's sheer weight and size gives great pleasure, and it's presence in a room dominates in a proud and glorious fashion. Wonderful sound from 180 gram vinyl. Record sleeves are enlarged text from Orphans little 78' record style sleeves, and hold great facts and mysterious knowledge all in giant print in it's original yellowed newspaper look. There is no mention of the source of these newsprint scans, but they were a gift to Mr. Waits many years ago, all pasted in a photo album in the 1880's. Hey..they didn't have API to fill up the pages in newpapers back then.....
0375831002|5.0|Death, the narrator, is wicked smart and quite poetic.  Set in WWII Nazi Germany, this is the first novel I have read that points to the devastion of war across politics.  The lessons regarding the power of words - books - etc., make it a reading level beyond the middle school set, and perhaps really only worthy of the devoted teenage reader.  I think it is a mistake to market this novel as young adult fiction -- I would hate to think that it would lose an adult audience that would love both the young subject of the novel, Liesel, and come to appreciate our protagonist, Death. I giggled, and I sobbed.  A rare novel. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AP04L0|5.0|Gary Cole is the heart and soul of Mike Judge's Office Space. His portrayal of Bill Lundberg (SP?) is so dead-on it is just hilarious to watch. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, an everyday 9 to 5 computer programmer for Initech. He hates his job and the whole rat race that surrounds it. In fact, all he really wants to do is watch Kung Fu with his super hot girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. So after being somewhat hypnotized during a therapy session, Peter decides to just stop going to work or going on his own terms which leads to hilarious results. Peter's cadre of co-workers include his underappreciated buddies Samir and Michael Bolton. When Peter learns that Initech plans to fire Samir and Michael, they hatch a scheme to rip off the company. If you've ever hated your job or felt trapped in a terrible company then you will definitely relate to Office Space. You may also recognize Milton (the office psycho) as the nerdy fat guy from dodgeball. Milton loves his red swingline stapler and playing his music at a reasonable volume. Diedrich Bader is also hilarious as Peter's neighbor Lawrence. Anyway, this movie is laugh out loud funny and a great addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Let me state upfront that I was very wary about this album. I realize that it is a soundtrack to a Cirque du Soleil play, and that in that sense it could've been nothing more than just another compilation of Beatles songs. Moreover some of my acquaintances and friends whose musical taste I respect, were disappointed with it. That lowered my expectations, but I decided to buy it anyway.<br /><br />\\"Love\\" (26 tracks, 79 min.) starts right off the bat with the best moments of the album: a mind-blowing a cappella version of \\"Because\\", followed by, in sequence: the famous piano chord ending of \\"A Day in the Life\\" IN REVERSE, the opening guitar riff of \\"Hard Day's Night\\", Ringo's drum solo of \\"The End\\" segueing into \\"Get Back\\"... GENIUS! There are many other delightful moments such as the drums and bass of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" used to augment/mash up \\"Within You Without You\\", and the mash-up of \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\", the latter one recalling the \\"Stars on 45\\" medley of Beatles songs, with the \\"minor\\" difference that this is actually the Beatles, rather than some 3rd rate imitation.<br /><br />In all, I find this to be a great addition to the Beatles catalogue. One of the things that struck me was how greatly improved the audio quality of the songs on the album is. I listened to this on regular stereo, and can only imagine how much better even it would've sounded like on the Audio 5.1 DVD version of this (which also is available in the deluxe package of this). Which brings me to my last point: how much longer before we get the truly remastered version of all the regular albums, which were issued on CD about 20 years ago?
B000H6SXMY|1.0|The packaging sux. Loox like a manila folder. Definitely go for the limited edition - the extra 100 bux is worth it for that AWESOME box!  <br /> <br />xoxoxo
0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond has an ambitious goal: explain the history of mankind globally.  His thesis is quite simple: different people had different histories because of geographical (environmental), not innate (racial) differences. He presents, develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully.    Some people remained hunters-gatherers, while others became masters of the world.  The crucial factor in human history is food. The availability of materials (plants, animals) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions, which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture (craftsmen, warriors, bureaucrats, priests, kings). Intensive food production, population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population. Craftsmen developed maritime, military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories.  Population growth generated a centralized organization (a state structure) for decision making (politics) and conflict resolutions (law).  Domestication provided other cardinal advantages. Infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases. Through intimacy with animals people became immune. But, when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized ones, they were wiped out. Also, animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means.  Other important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge: migration and, cardinally, writing.    While hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian, states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth. They became ruled by an elite which controlled nearly wholly (kleptocracy) or partially the manna of the state (the budget).  But, how could the elite continue to control the masses?  Jared Diamond sees 4 different solutions: arm the elite and disarm the masses, redistribution of wealth, impose public order and curb violence (police), construct ideology or religion to justify the kleptocracy.  The author remarks judiciously that with the organization of the state the irrational beliefs of the population became institutionalized into an `official' religion.    All in all, Jared Diamond's book is a magisterial and very revealing Darwinian essay about power problems and survival of the human species.  A must read for all those interested in the history of mankind.
0440539811|5.0|I first read R.A. Wilson's epochal \\"Illuminatus! Trilogy\\" twenty-five years ago and now, a quarter century later, find myself no less thrilled with it.<br /><br />Not just one of my favorites, it is also one of the truly formative books I've read in my lifetime, and has prompted me to study - with greater or lesser seriousness and in greater or lesser depth - a wide range of esoterica, from the \\"Principia Discordia,\\" to the writings of Hakim Bey and Peter Lamborn Wilson, to the Kabbalah and Chaos Magick.<br /><br />It has also prompted me to explore the role of a cultivated sense of humor as a spiritual path.<br /><br />Rabelais said to his readers, \\"For all your ills, I give you mirth.\\" Hagbard Celine, one of the heroes of \\"Illuminatus!\\" tells his devotees that Love will not free humankind, nor will political power nor force. Rather, it is our imaginations that will liberate humankind to achieve the evolutionary zenith of its destiny.<br /><br />To which this convinced Discordian and conspirator against consensus reality adds a hearty \\"Amen\\" and, as the Illuminati would say, \\"Ewige Blumenkraft!\\"
B00005JPCY|4.0|I found Tony Scott's \\"Deja Vu\\" incredibly fascinating, but I don't really understand why; many of the plot elements are based on the ideas and theories presented in science fiction stories, all of which are completely implausible, let alone unrealistic. And yet, for some inexplicable reason, the film works as a whole. It's both a crime thriller and a sci-fi marvel, a combination that has only recently found its niche in cinematic narrative (such as Steven Spielberg's \\"Minority Report\\"). The story is founded on the idea that deja vu--the strange sensation of familiarity in a new circumstance--is more than just a trick of the mind. It's actually a phenomenon resulting from an unprecedented scientific discovery: the ability to literally look into the past. What an intriguing concept, especially when it can be used to prevent a crime from happening. It may be impossible, but my God, it's entertaining.    The film begins with the explosion of a New Orleans ferryboat, one that was carrying over five hundred people, specifically military officers and their families. Brought on to the scene is Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), an ATF officer with a keen eye for detail. In attempting to discover the identity and whereabouts of the terrorist, he learns of a murdered woman named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), and right away, it's clear that she's somehow connected. For one thing, her body was found in the same river where the boat exploded. Furthermore, half of her body is burnt, and the fingers of her right hand are missing, seemingly because of the flying debris. But Carlin knows that she's more than just one victim of a nautical tragedy; something more sinister befell this woman, and he intends to find out what.    This is where the odd occurrences begin piling up, and if you're not watching closely, you'll leave the theater feeling more confused than satisfied. Consider the scene when Carlin searches Claire's apartment; her refrigerator is adorned with letter magnets, andthey spell the message, \\"U Can Sav Her.\\" Who exactly is this message for? Who's sending it? What does it mean? Also consider the moment when Carlin checks her answering machine; it contains one of his own messages from earlier in the day. He called because he was given a phone number from an unknown person, one who supposedly wanted to speak to him. How does this make any sense? For most of the film, it makes no sense at all; the woman who left the number would be found dead only hours later.    Bear with me, because that's just the start of the film's cryptic, cyclical nature. Carlin meets Agent Pyzwarra (Val Kilmer) and is immediately appointed to a special unit of the FBI, one that has access to special surveillance footage (supposedly obtained by top secret satellites orbiting the earth). Despite the fact that the material is four days old, the operators have the ability to view any person from any angle. How is such a thing possible when no surveillance equipment is present? Carlin begins to suspect something as he views footage of Claire; she has moments when she feels as if someone is watching her, and it's making her uneasy. His suspicions are confirmed when she actually sees the light of his laser pointer shining through the screen: he's looking into the actual past, not just recorded footage of it.    The theories behind this technology are far too complicated and wordy for me to cover in-depth. For the sake of simplicity, let's just say that a select group of scientists have found a way to fold the fabric of space, and we can now watch what has already happened. Such a radical new form of security leads to the discovery of Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), a militant psychotic who holds a grudge against the American government. It also leads to a pretty outrageous idea: if one can look into the past, then can one actually change the past? Carlin is willing to give it a try, not only because he wants to save the people on the ferry, but because he wants tosave Claire, as well. Of course, doing so will require him to be physically transported into the past, an act that's more than a little dangerous (according to the lab technicians, anyway). Will he be able to save the day, or are his actions an echo of events that have already transpired?    You've probably noticed that I've been asking a lot of rhetorical questions in this review, but short of revealing the outcome, there's no other way of summarizing the plot of \\"Deja Vu.\\" This is the kind of film that forces you to observe every single detail, no matter how minute or insignificant it may appear. Even if you are paying close attention, I can assure you that a couple of important things will come as a surprise by the end. For the sake of complete understanding--or, at the very least, for the sake of avoiding confusion--you may have to see this movie more than once. I'm considering doing that; even though I understood everything that happened, I'm almost positive that I missed some key details.     If such mind-engaging material is too much for those who merely want to escape in a story, then avoid \\"Deja Vu.\\" This goes double for those who seek plausible uses of science and technology; as entertaining as I found this film, it relied a little too heavily on suspension of disbelief. It's far too difficult to accept any of these ideas as possibilities, especially since they were included in a crime drama. Tony Scott was able to pull it off this time, and that's why I'm giving the film four stars. But I have a feeling that other director's may not be as lucky with such material; the genres are simply too different to allow for a completely cohesive narrative. If another such film is attempted, then here's hoping for the best.
B00005AQF7|4.0|I know, everyone considers this a classic, and is probably thinkin im out of my mind to give this a three, but i just wasnt a real big fan of it. I like snoop dogg, im not a very big fan tho, which probably is why i dont see this cd to be what everyone calls it.  In my eyes, aside from classic songs (gin n juice, whats my name, etc), i didnt like the rest.  o well, maybe itll be one of those albums that takes a little while to respect. I didnt like the chronic when i first heard it either, and that was a sick album.  Well, if my opinion changes at all after a few more listens, ill update my review, but until then, it gets 4.
0312330537|4.0|An extremely ambitious effort.  While categorized as a fictional novel, Roberts would have you believe, both in the book and his website, that at least the jobs and travels are true, while not making this claim for the women and friends noted in the book.  If true, the man has had more than nine lives.<br /><br />Hemingway-esque in its aspirations, one finds a travelogue of India and the Afghan/Pakistan border, a sociological study of the slums of Bombay and some of the fighting tribes in Afghanistan, a memoir of a failed man looking for redemption while maintaining a life of crime, an action thriller as the protagonist Linbad goes to a Bombay jail, fights toe to toe with his good friend Abdullah against a whole host of enemies including a pack of wild dogs and a gang of mysterious Iranians, and a philosophical journey as Linbad listens to a mafia king pin communicate his theory of good and evil from a quasi-scientific metaphysical perspective, all the while manipulating the lives of the people around him.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book though I admit the author goes right to the edge of being pretentious with his protagonist being portrayed as a lovely and lovable man who just happens to be a drug dealer, fugitive, and iresistable friend and compatriot.  To some, the author may have went overboard.<br /><br />The book is long at 900+ pages, which served me well at hunting camp where I take one long yet highly readable book to keep me awake during the long mid-day when the deer aren't moving.  While the book is not at the par of the previous two season's books (LBJ in the Senate and a biography of Alexander Hamilton), it did provide some great insight into India, the people that populate Bombay, particularly expats and the slum-dwellers, and a unique philosophical position that is one the author now promotes explicitly on his website that attempts to maintain a notion of God consistent with our scientific understanding of the universe and how the universe is \\"moving towards complexity\\".<br /><br />I think this book would be a wonderful basis for a multi-year TV series.  India is hot right now and we are mostly ignorant of its culture.  Having Linbad guide us weekly to all that is India while providing an adventure or two would be better than most of the crap on TV plus the book has at least 4 seasons worth of material, its that big of a book.\\"moving towards complexity\\". <br /> <br />I think this book would be a wonderful basis for a multi-year TV series.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|As someone who never read the X-men comics, I have nevertheless enjoyed all three of the movies.  This one suffers from diminishing returns like most sequels and while good, is not as coherent and satisfying as the first two.   <br /> <br />Minor spoilers ---  <br />Good points: It is an action movie with three terrific set pieces : Magneto's rescue of Mystique, the fight at Jean Grey's house and the end fight at Alcatraz.  As before, I liked the scenes between Magnito and Charles Xavier.  Their relationship is facinating and I wish it was visible more in all three of the movies.  Also, the introduction of Beast by Kelsey Grammer was interesting.  I did not expect him to be good in an action movie but he was. <br />  <br />Bad points : I know there are many mutants with different powers but it felt at times there were just too many to keep track of in a 104 minute movie.  Without the Dark Pheonix background in the comics, the Jean Grey story was hard to follow or fully understand.  I was not sure what she was beyond all powerful.  As a character, she was not well developed here. <br />    <br />In summary, I believe this was the weakest of the three X-Men movie but still had some interesting characters and action scenes that would allow me to recommend this movie to others.
0307346609|5.0|This book was extremely entertaining, well-written, and well-researched. The author clearly put a lot of thought into imagining the world's reaction to a zombie outbreak. Although the book is written in the form of ad hoc interviews, there is a somewhat linear retelling of the events leading up to, during, and after the outbreak.    I enjoyed the author's extrapolation of how each region of the world would react to the zombies. Each country, with its strengths and weaknesses in terms of culture, geography, and political climate, came across different fates during WWZ. The author thought the details through very well. For example, Iran was retold of having the military strength to withstand zombies, but the author thought of something I did not: how could it (or any country) deal with the millions of refugees coming across the border? And what of N. Korea? Those 23 million citizens having disappeared under the mysterious veil of their political war-machine could very well have either survived or turned all into zombies.     The final inexorable march of humanity's victory over the zombies was well done too. It reminded me of America's slow-but-sure island hopping strategy to reclaim the Pacific during WWII. The author's mention of the Redeker plan was extremely convincing. I actually had to look up that name in Wikipedia to see if this person really existed in history.    The only disappointment I had was the author does not delve into how the zombie outbreak came to be. What is the pathological reason for the existence of zombies? Note that I have not read the author's other book on surviving zombies, so I may be missing something.    All in all, extremely entertaining. I could not put the book down.
0743298020|3.0|Add a star if you are a female and add another 1/2 star if you haven't seen any movies in the past 10 years. I was given the book as a gift and felt somewhat forced to read it by a female university professor colleague of mine. While I must admit I admire the author's ability to write her reflective pieces differently from her updated narrative chapters (compare the long, beautiful prose of the former with the short sentence fragments and modern writing of the latter) I found the story to be derivitive, taxing, female-centric, and ultimately unsatisfying -- SPOILER: Why write a mysery novel and then not wrap up the mystery? There are several loose ends, and several characters just disappear.  Unforgivable. For fans of Rebecca, Wuthering Heights, The Woman in White -- none of which I would ever want to read again myself. Overrated, and overpraised by the critics.
B000ILYYJE|1.0|Amazingly, there is no signal being sent to my Polk subwoofer in Advanced Resolution Surround on my discs. The subwoofer does not even indicate a signal being received in this format at all. In stereo Advanced Res, it comes booming through perfectly and also in the digital DTS 5.1 format. So all is not a complete loss, but I did pay for the rush of high res surround. This is the only DVD-Audio I have ever experienced this with, have a Denon player and brand new Pioneer receiver. Obviously some kind of quality control snafu is present.
0345440900|5.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend when my daughter was about 3 months old.  I simply could not put it down, even though I was so tired all the time.  I read and followed all her advice and found her to be common sense, practical and just brilliant.  Her insight and advice made all the difference for me as a first time mom.  I had my baby sleeping through the night in 3 days!!  I have recommended this book to many first time moms and purchased many copies as gifts.  Her web-site is also phenomenal.  This is a must have for any mom, even if you have older children.
B000H7J9R6|4.0|Mr. Salles show his growth in this movie. He and the brilliant Mrs. Connely lead the movie to a high place. There's grat actors but the movie is in the Connelly's shoulders, and she didn't dissappointed us. Beside her beautiness, she is one of the best actress around. <br />Blu Ray tech is a promise yet. The image is not better than the DVD through HDMI. If you are a very good DVD player you didn't notice wich tech is better. I watched \\"The Last Samurai\\" HD-DVD edition and it seems to be better. Much better. Let's see what happens in the future.
B000002BUY|5.0|What we have here is undoubtedly the overwhelming favorite among longtime Incubus fans. I don't really fall into that category but I do love it to no end. Brandon's intensity is unparalelled here, Mike's guitar duties are as heavy as ever, Dirk (now departed) is ever present and sounds great, Jose is, as always, pounding away, and DJ Lyfe (now departed) plays a pivotal role as well. As much as I love the new stuff I can't say that each member plays as big of a role as they did on S.C.I.E.N.C.E. If there's one thing that I do find a lot more satisfying here it'd be the prominence of Brandon's percussion additions (not to mention the excellent use of thet didjeridu!).<br /><br />Let's say on the off chance that you're new to Incubus and have yet to venture this far back. If you'd need a hint of the heaviness and whatnot, I'd say if you'd take the heaviness of Out From Under (Make Yourself) and Make Yourself (Make Yourself), then mix the vocal stylings of Under My Umbrella (Morning View) and Megalomaniac (A Crow Left Of The Murder), you'd basically know what to expect. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is heavy and doesn't let up very often. I love that about this CD though and I can't help but wonder why they don't pull out more songs from here in concert.<br /><br />If I were to dissect this record into favorites I'd, without a doubt, start with Redefine. It's the perfect opener because it pretty much accurately lets on how the rest of the CD is going to sound, i.e., some rapping, yelling, singing, and some distorted guitar riffs. From there, you name it I like it. The only song I might leave out is the instrumental which doesn't do much of anything, Magic Medicine. Favorite Things is a fun romp with nice lyrics and a nice riff throughout. Nebula features one of Mike's heaviest riffs ever and features some insane vocal work. Deep Inside is pretty funny. And Calgone is the perfect closer complete with winding slow/fast verses and a wonderful chorus. All in all, it's as close to perfection as radio rock is ever gonna get.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Redefine, New Skin, Favorite Things, Summer Romance, and Calgone. It wasn't going to be easy for Incubus to top this, and in some fans minds they never will, but for this fan, I think they did. However, if you just want to hear Incubus go all out S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the CD to go to without question. It's sure to get your blood rushing one way or another and so long as they keep making music (knock on wood), each and every fan will always compare the new CD to this one. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the place to start for newcomers for sure, and for everyone else, it's highly recommended.ection as radio rock is ever gonna get. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are Redefine, New Skin, Favorite Things, Summer Romance, and Calgone.

B000FQ4M58|3.0|I first reviewed Bat Out Of Hell 3 on Amazon shortly after its release. One year on and many more listens later I wanted to do a double take on Bat Out Of Hell 3, minus the rose-tinted glasses I had on first time around. I couldn't help myself after all I'm a big fan, listening to a new Meat Loaf album, with 'new' Jim Steinman songs, why would it not be worthy of anything but five stars?    POSITIVE: Meat Loaf is singing better than ever. Pulling of the likes of \\"Blind As A Bat\\" is nothing short of remarkable. \\"Blind As A Bat\\" is the standout song on Bat Out Of Hell 3, verging on being one of the best songs Meat Loaf has ever recorded. It was written by James Michael and Nikki Sixx. There are other songs too: \\"Alive\\" and \\"What About Love\\", both worthy of being on a Bat album and both incidentally were not written by Steinman.    Meat salvages older Steinman songs like \\"Bad For Good\\" and \\"It's All Coming Back To Me\\" from previous Steinman projects and he succeeds in making them his own, even if they do lack the rawness of their predecessors. Desmond Child is on the production helm and holds this mighty ship together with plenty of bells and whistles. \\"Monstero\\" is an organ fuelled overture and is of the substance that Bat albums are made off. Many of the original Bat Out Of Hell musicians, including Todd Rundgren, turn out for this grand outing. Nikki Sixx and John 5 are on here too. Brian May makes an interesting if somewhat pointless appearance for the opening of \\"Bad For Good\\". Some of Meat Loaf's long standing road band get the opportunity to dazzle, none more so than Patti Russo who makes her last outing as Meat Loaf's other half for \\"What About Love\\". Patti Russo should have taken the lead for all female vocals, no one else comes close to her. Try searching the internet for a leaked version of Russo singing \\"The Future Aint What It Used To Be\\" - let's hope she graces more Steinman songs with her voice.    NEGATIVE: Don't be fooled. The extent of Steinman's involvement in Bat Out Of Hell 3 was principally the lawsuit Meat Loaf filed against him over the right to use the Bat Out Of Hell title. OK so Steinman has allowed Meat Loaf to use his older material, plus a couple of newly penned cast-offs. Funny, but in the 1980's/early 1990's Meat Loaf could be heard slagging Steinman for writing \\"Bad For Good\\" claiming that Steinman was pandering to the whims of the record companies who were looking for \\"another Bat Out Of Hell\\", but it now appears that when Meat Loaf is in desperate need of Steinman songs to record for Bat Out Of Hell 3, he seems to forget his moral standing on this matter and suddenly \\"Bad For Good\\" is good enough for him to record. \\"In The Land Of The Pigs\\" and \\"If It Aint Broke Break It\\" succeed only on the typically punchy Steinman titles; lyrically and musically they are pointless rants. \\"Seize The Night\\" is essentially a sloppy recycle job of \\"Good Girls Go To Heaven.\\"    It's nothing against Steinman or his most recent writings. Steinman had more tracks for Bat Out Of Hell 3 and of the calibre that you'd expect from this musical genius: \\"What Part Of My Body Hurts The Most\\" and \\"(It Hurts) Only When I Feel\\" were even performed live by Meat Loaf who claimed they would be recorded for Bat Out Of Hell 3. However, Steinman is a canny guy and he wasn't going to be pressurised into jumping through Meat Loaf's hoops when delivering the final Bat album. Unfortunately for us we'll probably never hear Meat Loaf record these Steinman songs, but the leftovers on Bat Out Of Hell 3 will undoubtedly suffice the marketing machine, or at least make it OK to slap on a sticker boasting \\"new songs by Jim Steinman\\".    Desmond Childs production is alright, but it's not Jim Steinman, and the result can sometimes be an overproduced sound reminiscent of early 1990's pop/rock. Diane Warren shows up to contribute \\"Cry Over Me\\", but it has no place on Bat Out Of Hell 3, even on an album like this that is a little disjointed at the best of times, the song is simply dire. Patti Russo has been sidelined in favour of two other female vocalists for the remaining duets. You'd think that Meat Loaf would have worked out that after thirteen years that Russo can't be topped. (Now Russo has been dropped from the band you can't help wondering if the Loaf is on some irrational power trip or is shamefully and uncharacteristically crawling to the record label suits). In the end it looks like Steinman is having the final laugh by allowing Meat Loaf to record \\"Cry To Heaven\\" as the albums closing track - as if it were meant to be another \\"Lost Boys And Golden Girls\\" or \\"Heaven Can Wait\\". Sadly it is neither, and by the time some whistles are thrown into the mix, the sentiment is vomit inducing.    IN CONCLUSION: Bat Out Of Hell 3 is fine enough but it's not the album it should have been. It's not what it says on the tin. I would however pay the full price just to hear \\"Blind As A Bat\\" but in essence Bat Out Of Hell 3 is cobbled together. In all fairness to Meat Loaf he's cobbled it together with some of the finest musicians in the business, a testament perhaps to the mighty dollar, but it doesn't make it right. It's your call to decide what a Bat album should be to you.    But when all is said and done, Meat Loaf is still one of the greatest performers of all time; the master of all things over the top and the king of thrilling rock and this perhaps makes it easy to be critical when certain elements of his work don't quite come up to par. Regardless of what Meat Loaf does he will undoubtedly remain, as he does here, in his own league.
B000002KHH|5.0|HEY, JUST WONDERING IF THE 1990 RELEASES ARE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS AND NOT THE REMASTERED OF 1996 AND THE BLACK BOX SET. JOE SIEGLER'S WEBSITE STATES THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THE CLIPS ON HERE ARE TOO CRAPPY TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I DOWNLOADED A VERSION OF HAND OF DOOM  AND ELECTRIC FUNERAL AND IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. DON'T MIND IF YOU SEND ME A SONG TO LET ME SEE EITHER. :) I ALREADY HAVE 1996 ALONG WITH ANOTHER FOUR ALBUMS JUST BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE BLACK BOX SET. I WON'T MIND TO PISS AWAY MORE MONEY FOR BLACK SABBATH. :)~
B000J103X4|5.0|Its safe to go ahead and add the Doctor's Advocate to the list. It is a true west coast classic. No Curtis Jackson, no Andre Young, and Game still did it.  GREAT CD! Any westcoast hip hop fan must have this in the collection.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Rent/buy this movie, period. This is the best film of 2005, and most critics agree--which is rare. In fact I have yet to read an unfavorable review written by a professional critic. Anyone who would rate this film less than A- in Story, Acting, Direction, Visuals, and Overall probably did not actually see the film! It is such an honest portrayal of two people's love for each other.  <br /> <br />The breathtaking cinematography alone is oscar-worthy. Then you have the masterpiece short and simple story transformed to the big screen effortlessly. Heath Ledger could have won best actor for his portrayal of the cowboy whose emotions were so far bottled up inside him that he could barely speak. You can feel his every emotion, ranging from guilt, embarrassment, sorrow and joy without his uttering more than a few syllables. Jake is also brilliant. Both are at the beginning of very long and fruitful careers if this is a part of what they are capable of. <br /> <br />This film starts in 1963, a time when acceptance of diversity was not widespread. In some ways we have come a long way from that time period, but in others our country has not. This film affirms why two people in love (man/woman, man/man, woman/woman) should be given equal rights in marriage under the law--why marriage has caused a big policital debate does not make sense. Aren't there other, more significant global problems to deal with than two people in love wanting to have a recognized committed relationship? This film is not about that issue specifically, but it is impossible not to consider this after you see the results of these two men living a life of secrets and lies over several years. One tries to come up with a solution, whereas the other is too ashamed and fearful to pursue his truth. And it is a shame--a very sad reality. See the movie, especially if you are hetero, because for 2 hours you may see the best film ever made about two men in love, and some of the challenges it can bring. Ask yourselfwhat you would do in either of the men's situations.  Would you be honest about who you are and who you love or hide in shame and fear because of how others might judge you?
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I had to search high and low for the 2-disc version of Love, but by all means, it is worth it. That way you can have one for your car and one for home and you will not be dissappointed. The idea of George Martin and Son sitting in a room with all those original tracks is simply the stuff that dreams are made of to an admitted Beatle Geek like me, but I think that this result will appeal to people on most every level. At times, you are lulled into just listening to a mix that is 95% of what the original was - just fuller and more the way you heard it in your head \\"all those years ago.\\" And then, without warning, you are listening to bits and pieces of tracks from the vault that somehow miraculously fit together in an incredible total package that will delight the hardcore fans, and welcome those youngsters who missed out on the magic the first time around. A splendid time is guaranteed for all....
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I finally got the DVD-A version of this album, after buying the stereo-only version first b/c the local store was sold out of the special edition (apparently it's doing very well commercially!).  I'd have to agree with the maj. of reviews below, this is an absoultely wonderful trippy time to be had by all!  Both long-time Beatles fans and newcomers should enjoy this set.  Well done.    However, on my DVD-A player the jet-noise end of \\"Back In The USSR\\" is CUT in two places!!  It's just like a dropout, or a track change silence on the old cd recorders.  What up????  I doublechecked the stereo CD, the fade on \\"USSR\\" is just fine.  AAAUGH!     I'm playing it on a relatively new Pioneer DV-578A, which plays just about every format under the sun, including DVD Audio and SACD.  Haven't had a problem with it as yet, perhaps it's just my luck that the first one is plaguing this masterpiece.      Anyone else having this problem?  Is this another 'whoops' like the mono mixup on Capitol Albums Vol. 2?    In any event, even with this hiccup it's absolute bliss to experience The Beatles at this level of SQ.  I'm glad I got to hear it.  Can't wait for the hi-res remasters of the entire catalogue!

B000002GVO|3.0|Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time. To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'. We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album. Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands. If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful. For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Can't believe the number of negative comments here.  One of Shakira's great strengths is her multi-cultural diversity.  If you thinks she's \\"Latin\\" all you must be listening to is Pies Descalzo or Donde Estan Ladrones.  I have everything this woman has ever done (including Magia and Peligro) and her refusal to be confined to a style or genre is what makes her great and gives her the wide appeal she has.  This is also the reason she does her own producing; maintaining creative control. <br /> <br />Just shut up, sit back and listen; you'll find magic here if you do. <br /> <br />PS., I don't speak a word of Spanish. <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|How can anyone trash this? This is the greatest rock band in the world doing something different. To have a true, clean stereo mix of \\"I am the Walrus\\" is a treat in itself. Have you heard this cd in 5.1 surround? It actually feels like you sitting there with them in the recording studio. Unbelievable. I say 'hooray' for Apple to come up with something so artsy. John would've loved that. <br />My favorites are the real creepy \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite...\\". The rough screams of Paul in the end singing lines from Helter Skelter. Sends chills down my spine! <br />And how about how Gnik Nus flows beautifully into Something.  <br />While My Guitar Gently weeps has a wonderful score added to it. I want to hold your hand makes you feel like you are at the Ed Sullivan theater, except this time you can hear the band.  <br />Overall I think this was a very cool concept. The more I listen to this CD the more I fall in LOVE.
B000002HK4|5.0|True, ACOS is nearly perfect in every way, a joy to behold, and one of those songs to listen to, study, reflect upon, and drink in over and over, always wanting more... <br /> <br />But the covers are the hidden treat on this album... <br />Everyone knew they were getting their money's worth on the title track, but the way they acknowledge their fans by giving so much more, they're just too good to us!  It truly is FUN being a fan of DT. Listen and ENJOY!
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson's 1979 solo debut Off The Wall stands today as Michael Jackson at his rawest and most sincere.     Long before the scandals, the nose jobs, and the court appearances, Michael Jackson was the youngest member of the beloved Jackson 5, later known as the Jacksons. In the late 70's, Michael was no longer a little boy, he was a young man who, in a few years, became the biggest selling solo artist and the most exciting live act since The Beatles. He teamed up with producer Quincy Jones, and the result was a collaboration that spawned 3 classic albums within 8 years: Off The Wall, the record breaking Thriller, and Bad.    Off The Wall captures Jackson right before the madness kicked in, and it is quite a moment to cherish. The 10-track album features some of Michael's greatest classics: the US number 1 hits Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, and the groovy Rock With You, the sweet ballad She's Out Of My Life (a song so sincere that MJ actually cries at the end), the upbeat Working Day And Night, the Paul McCartney penned Girlfriend, and, one of my personal favorites, the charming title track Off The Wall.     Many people regard Thriller, the 1982 follow up, as Michael's greatest achievement. Thriller was so successful that it overshadowed the Grammy winning debut. Whatever the case may be, Off The Wall is definitely Michael's prized contribution to music, an album so sweet and so modest, Michael ought to take lessons from it for his future release.

B000G7PMD2|5.0|Can these guys really keep getting better???  I know some people are complaining about the setlist, but it works for me.  Spans their careers pretty well, I think. I mean, if I REALLY want to hear all of their old stuff at the same time, I'll listen to an older concert.  I really enjoy the live sets, not only for the energy, but for them to achieve their high level of playing while playing together, live, speaks volumes to me about their talent.  Plus, (and you know they know this, too), their songs NEVER sound the same twice.  I mean, I've got bootlegs of consecutive shows on the same tour, promoting the same material, and they not only play different setlists, but the songs they do play every night NEVER are identical.  They have fun with it, mix it up. You gotta love that!   James even sounds better than usual. I think he's mellowing as he ages.  Anyways, I really, really love this show, and if someone has never heard them live before, before I play for them LATM or MLINYC, I'll play this one FOR SURE!

0060934913|5.0|This is an interesting read into the back alleys of life inside a restaurant. If you've ever worked in the BOH or FOH, you'll probably recognize similarities between your own crazy stories, and his. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. It's a quick read... you won't want to put it down! I wish there was a sequel.
B000G73UEU|5.0|I saw the video of \\"I'm Your Man\\" which is half-documentary and half concert film, was blown away and immediately ordered the CD.  While it's true that some of the singing is, shall we say, weird, most of it is just wonderful.  That Cohen's poetry is celestial is indisputable, and it's nice that these young folks like it, too.  A particular treat was Teddy Thompson's rendition of \\"Tonight Will Be Fine.\\"  Cohen's lyrics just kill.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|I am and always will be a true fan of U2, but I felt a little cheated when I bought the \\"Deluxe\\" edition for 30 bucks only to find out that if you down load it from itunes you get an extra track. Other than that the book is fantastic and I like the one new track \\"windows..\\". The dvd rocks too. Definitely worth the money if you are a true fan.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|With their third studio album, My Chemical Romance seems to become less emo and more in the footsteps of Green Day with apparent ambitions of making The Black Parade as big a success as American Idiot, as other reviewers also have pointed out. In my opinion they have more or less achieved that characteristic, though being a bigger fan of Green Day I would have to credit American Idiot with being the better album here. Regardless, The Black Parade still is clearly worthy to be a recipient of five stars, for with this album My Chemical Romance has gone down a path full of excellent contrasts of soft and heavy melodies, with always catchy song structure and lyrics that aren't afraid to get up close and personal while electric guitars are slamming in the background or even during the calmer songs (such as the beginning of \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" and the opening track). The album as a whole may seem dark owing to many of the song titles and perhaps the trotting skeleton on the front cover, but this is not entirely so; some tracks such as \\"Dead!\\" have a somewhat bouncy, sprightly feel with the electric guitar and Gerard does not sound as mournful on this album as he does for example in the hit \\"Ghost of You\\" from Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge. Aside from that, I would suppose that the album is rather dark, though the band's newfound concentration on a more refined hard rock sound contributes more to deliciously loud and solid guitar jams than it does to whiny lyrics. Not to say that Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was whiny, for its emo characteristics are very vague and the album as a whole is more alternative than emo thankfully. In conclusion, The Black Parade shows further improvement from My Chemical Romance with its powerful expression of emotion and great guitar riffs; I'd probably call it the band's best though their second CD has been one of my favorites for awhile now. For once I'm beginning to hear the band get airplay on the hard rock rather than alternative stations, perhaps a sign that their faltering emo influence is gaining a different audience's respect. That may have something to do with Gerard dying his hair white; but anyway, I'd give this album five stars and would most recommend the tracks \\"Dead!\\", \\"How I Disappear\\", and \\"Teenagers\\".

B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence's decision to lean a bit more on the heavy side with this album away from the style of past hits like \\"My Immortal\\" is in my opinion a fairly good one. By having less predominantly soft tracks and instead more songs like the hit \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" that combine components of soft and hard (often with piano, violin, and pounding electric guitars), Evanescence is able to generate a more unique sound that ventures away from sounding like the countless female artists on the pop hit stations whose music never involves hard electric guitar-playing in the background. For a long time, Evanescence was the only band I ever heard on the hard rock stations with a female singer, and by making an album with an even more prominent inclination towards a hard rock style they have preserved their uniqueness. While Evanescence's hits now sometimes share hard rock radio space with Flyleaf's hits (they have a female vocalist also), the band's relatively Gothic style of blending oftentimes eerie strings and guitar patterns with Amy Lee's heartfelt vocals still seems to not sound similar to any other band. As for the softer side of The Open Door, Evanescence still has a considerable degree of talent with making softer pieces too and a song with a peaceful nature as of \\"My Immortal\\" would not have been a disappointment to find on The Open Door; some tracks such as \\"Lose Control\\" on this album do have some of those qualities and are more or less as appreciable as the songs that are heavy all the way through. One of the hardest songs on here, \\"Cloud Nine\\", is now my favorite Evanescence song for its awesome drums, creepy ambience, and rockin' riffs to match. \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" also is probably among my favorite Evanescence tunes also, with only a few of my favorites still coming from Fallen (such as the hit \\"Going Under\\"). Overall I'd say this is a great second album (third I guess if you count the live CD) that ranks pretty well among the other releases of 2006.If you liked Fallen, chances are you'll end up liking The Open Door just as much if not more. Five stars!
0743289412|5.0|I have read Stephen King's newest book from cover to cover.  I say this up front as I have noticed that many people who rated this one or two stars eventually fess up to not reading the book all the way through.  As soon as I discover they didn't finish the book I skip the review.  If you are not going to read Lisey's Story through don't reveiw it.  If you feel you must vent in any case at least state from the beginning you didn't finish it.  It is also quite obvious that some who claim to read it either a.) don't pay attention to what they read or b.)have retention rates of a smucking four-year-old.   <br /> <br />With the diatribe out of the way let's look at Lisey's Story.  I liked it.  It was a bit reminiscent of Bag of Bones at first but ultimately a different story.  The central theme is how a person copes with the death of their spouse.  That the dead spouse in this case is a well-known author should be no surprise.  Those who criticize King for his use of authors as main characters in his work have obviously forgotten the old adage of \\"write what you know\\".  This makes a lot of sense.  King has written about working in an industrial laundry, he has written a bit about teaching, but for the most part he chooses most of his protaganists from the world of letters.  It works for him.  It works for me also, as a reader.  What could King possibly know of being a computer programmer, or postman, or insurance underwriter, or even a lawyer?  Nothing.  He has been a writer since his early days and has been a published author since his mid-twenties.  While his stories are fascinating they are often about more than just the tale being spun out.  Thus, he has a theme to explore, and he writes a story, and to keep things simple he chooses a writer for the main character.   <br /> <br />Lisey's Story is a well-written tale of trying to heal after the loss of one's life mate.  Along the way Lisey encounters many obstacles, including those wishing to benefit from his death,and, the bane of all celebrities, the whack job.  She also has some more private boojums including her sisters and their lives.  I thorougly enjoyed reading this over a period of two days.  I could hardly put it down.  It is his best post-Dark Tower work.  It heartens me to see he is still in the writing game and still going strong. <br /> <br />A final note to some of the one-star reviewers.  Try to think things through a bit more instead of wheeling out tired old trash.  I seriously doubt King is writing to pay his bills at this point in time.  He is writing because he has to and he shares because that's a part of the compulsion with any story teller.  I hope we see more stories from him in the future.
B000002BBY|2.0|I like the song Wonderwall.  It had something special and undeniable but I just can't get into the majority of Oasis music.  They occasionally hit on something that is \\"catchy\\" but since the Beatles broke up, anything vaguely \\"catchy\\" is considered to be \\"Beatlesque\\".  Likewise, nowadays, when anything is \\"catchy\\", it would have to be considered \\"rare\\".  Arrangement wise, I've always thought of Oasis as more like a wall of sound.   Which is \\"Spectoresque\\".   I'm a guitar player and a recording engineer and I just don't think their guitar player is especially good and their recordings are muddy.  A free for all.  That may be due to the fact that a lot of guitar players who aren't very good hide the fact by playing very loudly.   I don't want to bash the group.  I want to like them but I just can't.  Besides this one, I own two more of their albums.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|Lo mas seguro es que muchos seguidores de KISS tengan los tres primeros ALIVE y no le vean el sentido a esto, en mi caso particular, tengo los tre Alive!, pero, el precio del box set no es tan elevado, en segundo lugar, el box set esta muy bien hecho, version digipack que se abre con cuatro cds, es decir, los dos primeros Alive vienen en un solo disco cada uno y no en dos como era antes.  El Alive III trae Take It Off que estaba solo disponbible en la japonesa, dicho sea de paso, es tremenda cancion. <br /> <br />El Alive IV, el que estaba originalmente esta muy bueno, es interesante escichar canciones como Heavens On Fire y Lick it up por el line up original. <br /> <br />El libro interior esta bueno, muchas fotos que no estaban en los alives anteriores.   <br /> <br />Para mi, un cinco estrellas, y eso que no estoy de acuerdo con tanta recopilacion de KISS, pero con esta, totalmente. <br /> <br />Lo que dicen del sticker de los bonus tracks de 2000 man y God Of Thunder, en mi caso, no estaba. <br />
B00005JOVN|3.0|What began as an innocent New Year's party with a sexy performance from singer Gloria (Black Eyed Peas' Fergie, aka Stacy Ferguson) literally goes upside down for the passengers of the luxury liner Poseidon. A majority of the passengers die, except for a selected few: seasoned gambler Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) and daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), unlucky-in-love homosexual Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), Jen's fianc Christian (Mike Vogel), Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon), and onboard waiter Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez). But as they proceed through the sinking ship, they must deal with the fact that not everyone will survive. <br /> <br />Back in 1972, there was a popular disaster flick called \\"The Poseidon Adventure.\\" Starring Gene Hackman and Shelly Winters, this flick wasn't anything big, but it earned Winters a Golden Globe win for Best Supporting Actress, and had the song \\"The Morning After\\" which, of course, got an Academy Award for Best Original Song. And it's no surprise that a remake would pop out of nowhere, because who wants to see this opus with modern-day special effects and new actors to populate the Poseidon. Who better to turn to disaster flick maestro Wolfgang Peterson? <br /> <br />And boy does this movie pack on the special effects. Sure, they're nothing really special, but whenever an explosion occurs, glass breaks, or water fills, they can bring up blood curdling tension. And wait until you see the finale, which can be explained as nothing more or less of a doozy. Director Peterson knows what the crowd wants, and he delivers. Composer Klaus Badelt (\\"16 Blocks\\") even adds a good soundtrack that is actually suspenseful than cheesy. <br /> <br />Compared to what critics are saying, \\"Poseidon\\" has some decent acting. Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell take advantage of their 2D characters and give them enough heroics and heart. There are some good performances from up-and-coming actresses Emmy Rossum (\\"Phantom of the Opera\\") and Jacinda Barrett (\\"Ladder 49\\"). Sadly, Peterson is sometimes too fixated with the disaster that he fumbles dealing with stereotypical characters, including the ones played by Richard Dreyfuss (as the gay guy), Jimmy Bennett (as the annoying little brat), and Mia Maestro (overacting as the stowaway) who fail to come off worthy of our attention. But as long as you focus on the more developed characters (Lucas and Russell the most), it shouldn't be a big deal. <br /> <br />Which is why I had to give this film an 8. The suspense of this movie is massive, but it's dramatically inert when several annoying characters are introduced (I know I'm gonna go to hell for this, but I wished they got rid of Nelson and the annoying brat), thus failing to let Josh Lucas grow as an actor and Kurt Russell get back his credibility (though he had success with 2003's \\"Dark Blue\\"). But aside from this, if you're looking for a good popcorn movie, \\"Poseidon\\" should entertain.

B00005JP01|2.0|Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a bad boy who keeps moving from town to town every time he gets in trouble. After racing against bully schoolmate Clay (Zachary Ty Brian) and getting in a fight with him, the police recommend that he move to Tokyo with his father (Brian Goodman) to learn some lessons. His father prohibits him from driving, but after meeting smooth-talking hustler Twinkie (Bow Wow), he enters the world of drift racing that goes around Tokyo. One of the reigning champions of the sport goes by the nickname D.K. (Brian-Tee). Little does he know that D.K. has ties to the Yakuza crime syndicate, and after losing a race, he is forced to pay off the debt of his loss by venturing into the deadly realm of the Tokyo underworld, where the stakes are life and death. And it doesn't help matters that he starts dating D.K.'s girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelly). <br /> <br />If one thing's for certain, every installment of \\"The Fast & The Furious\\" is known for several things: cardboard acting, bare-bones plot, and tense racing scenes. For the first two movies, Paul Walker was the lead, and in every movie, he had to go undercover as a gangsta street racer taking down a syndicate. Sure, those movies weren't really deep, but with a good sense of humor to back up the implausibility, no one cared. Those movies made buck. <br /> <br />Well, now that Paul Walker has left, along with Tyrese Gibson and Vin Diesel (or does he?), the latest installment switches gears for a new type of ball game. Instead of an undercover cop, we got a brat going mano-y-mano against the Yakuza. Justin Lin (\\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\") is, of course, leading the franchise to a new direction trying to add some bones to the franchise, but with the original producers of the franchise - Amanda Cohen (sister of director Rob Cohen, or so I think) and Neal H. Moritz - involved, it's pretty much the same deal. But that does NOT mean there's some fun to be had. <br /> <br />Obviously, as soon as the intro and credits (for the first time) kick in, you get that feeling that you're not seeing a Oscar-winning hit here. It's your basic popcorn-munching alternative to the summer when other movies are playing. For this installment of \\"F&F,\\" the budgets has gone smaller, but the ingredients are still there: CG-rendered cars racing across twisty highways, sexy girls populating clubs, minimal use of plot, and basically the worst acting you ever seen. <br /> <br />Too bad some of the action sequences aren't really exciting. While Lin does want to ramp up the absurdity (but not too much, because Sean is not the best drifter) for the sake of fun, it ain't much to write home about. There's quite a lot of shaky camera views, super-quick close-ups, and other stylish tricks to ramp up speed. It works for the second half, but I suggest for part 4 (if there ever will be one) that CG-rendered cars should be removed for real cars. <br /> <br />And I don't really like the acting that much. Lin is obviously directing the trials and tribulations of Sean Boswell. But not only does Lucas Black (of \\"Friday Night Lights\\" fame) come off as a bad impersonation of Paul Walker with a hillbilly accent, but the producers prohibit some shade of character development. They even have Twinkie, played to comic relief by Bow Wow, own various types of bling and Lebron James shoes. The star power is small, except for Sonny Chiba and - in a cameo - Vin Diesel. Maybe it's a good idea, because doesn't the franchise cater to teenagers and adrenaline-fueled junkies? <br /> <br />There are other questionable aspects: bizarre music played in background (\\"Bawitdaba\\" and a couple of tracks that sound like they came out of \\"Dance Dance Revolution\\") is one of my main beefs. But Lin has managed to save any creative energy for the last two race scenes which actually bring out some tension that was missing in the beginning. \\"The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" is still a far cry from a reinvention, but baby steps nevertheless.

B00005JOVH|4.0|The death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has taken a toll on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden). Things change, however, when she is revealed to be alive in the same ocean she drowned in. However, when Scott rescues her, he dies, and Wolverine and Ororo Monroe/Storm (Halle Berry) take Jean and keep her in a rejuvenation center. However, Grey winds up acting homicidal and winds up killing everything and everyone, including Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Magneto (Ian McKellan) kidnaps her, along with other mutants. Matters are further complicated when a \\"cure\\" to eradicate mutant DNA surfaces, and what follows is a war between the good mutants and the bad mutants. <br /> <br />Even before there was a \\"Spider-Man,\\" the most famous comic book film of the millennium was \\"X-Men.\\" Starring big-named heavyweights (Halle Berry, Ian McKellan, and Patrick Stewart) and directed by Bryan Singer (\\"The Usual Suspects\\"), both \\"X-Men\\" movies were box office gold. Not to mention did it make Aussie hunk Hugh Jackman a major star. Bad news came in 2005 when Bryan Singer ditched out of his latest opus to do \\"Superman Returns.\\" To add more fuel to the fire, comic book fanboy Brett Ratner (any Chris Tucker movies and \\"After the Sunset\\") would be asked to direct it. And here we are, in 2006. <br /> <br />Despite new direction, \\"The Last Stand\\" remains the same concoction that Bryan Singer developed. As with any new installment, the movie features brand new mutants: Angel (Ben Foster), Beast (Kelsey Grammar), Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Leech (Cameron Bright), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and Siryn (Shauna Kain). Of course, too much is too much, and with the movie clocking in at 105 minutes (just as in the original), Ratner doesn't seem to develop some of these characters, especially Angel and Kitty Pride (the latter develops a \\"bond\\" with Bobby Drake, which isn't explained if he really loves her or not). <br /> <br />Ratner picks the movie back up to speed when the finale kicks off. Of course, he's going for an all-mutant free-for-all, but slick camera work and tense music from composer John Powell keeps things in perspective. He also has a tendency to end the movie on a bittersweet note, killing off a couple of mutants from all installments. However, the movie doesn't have the gravitas as the last two installments, and some of the more sentimental scenes come off rather fake. I'm told the \\"X-Men\\" comic books had a soap opera-style story, but the rancid, melodramatic scenes (including one between Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry) are a bit of a doozy to sit through. <br /> <br />I still enjoyed the cast, however. Once again, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, and Patrick Stewart are in top form. Halle Berry manages to pull a bravura performance after stinking up 2004's \\"Catwoman\\" (good thing she has a sense of humor about that one). And you haven't lived until you've seen Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ellen Page (Kitty Pride) on screen. <br /> <br />Too bad for formerly interesting side actors. Famke Janssen has a tendency to overact (given, she has done \\"nip/tuck\\") instead of offering Jean Grey some bits of genuine pathos, even if she went evil. Scenes between Shawn Ashmore (looking to join Paul Walker into the \\"School of Keanu Reeves Wannabes\\") and Anna Paquin/Ellen Page are flat and unfocused. And Ben Foster's Angel doesn't get deserved screen time, because his backstory is very interesting out of the bunch. <br /> <br />Regardless, Brett Ratner does the unthinkable and makes the plothole-ridden package come full circle. It's not gonna win any awards, but then again, the last two installments clearly weren't Oscar contenders. Any movie that has Rebecca Romijn naked in a fetal position will bring in a torrent of male moviegoers.

B00005JOUM|4.0|When master thief Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) takes a bank hostage, NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are called onto the scene to investigate and ease the situation. But they don't realize that Dalton is smarter than the average bank robber, and hostages constantly get whacked off. Complicating matters for the cops is Manhattan Trust's chairman of the board, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). A man with something to hide (in a secret safe-deposit box), Case hires power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to move and shake her way into the middle of the crisis, the better to protect Case's secret. <br /> <br />If anything, Spike Lee is a good director. However, during the course of the new millennium, he has churned out a bunch of rancid comedy-dramas: \\"Bamboozled\\" (with Damon Wayans) and \\"She Hate Me\\" (with Anthony Mackie). The problem wasn't that Denzel Washington - Spike's trump card - wasn't in them. They just weren't funny or insightful. So cut to 2006, and we have ran into the director's latest opus, \\"Inside Man\\". Good news, it's a great thriller that finally reunites him with Washington, and casts plenty of famous white actors/actresses (including Willem Dafoe, Foster, Owen, and Plummer) in memorable roles. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Man\\" touches on plenty of topics, one of many is Lee's trademark - race. But here, he manages to get into a groove instead of struggling to find a consistent tone, and enters into \\"25th Hour\\" territory by using 9/11 archetypes a backdrop. An act of terror in a bustling bank bristles blacks, whites, Sikhs, Latinos, and Jews in equal measure. The cops on the scene hardly hold in their own prejudices, and Lee playfully frames the film with two versions of A.R. Rahman and Gulzar's hit Bollywood song \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\". <br /> <br />There are also plenty of twists. We won't spoil too much for you, but as mentioned in the plot summary above, we know that Plummer's character has shady motives, and that Dalton may be doing more than just a heist. <br /> <br />And let's not forget the performances. Washington once again pulls in another powerhouse performance playing Keith Frazier. He keeps dropping monologues, stays even-tempered (much like he did in \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\"), plays cat-and-mouse games with Owen's bank robber, and shares some often humorous chemistry with Ejiofor (another great African-American actor, circa \\"Four Brothers\\"). Of course, he can play this character in his sleep, and we'd praise him no matter what. He shares equal chemistry shared with other stars, such as Foster (doing another impressive job as another female protagonist), Dafoe, and Plummer. <br /> <br />Well, it's safe to say Spike Lee has come back, but not in the way you hoped for. It still has Lee focusing in on racial issues, but he has created a thriller that is not loud or relying on cheap pyrotechnics. It wouldn't be obvious, considering he has Denzel Washington in his holster.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|I'm sorry but did anyone ever ask for the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition to be released without the bonus features?  Second, the title is misleading because this really isn't a Limited Edition as the title so aptly states.  Don't be duped into thinking this is the box set for the ORIGINAL EDITIONS of the Star Wars Trilogy. <br /> <br />I find the method of releasing the Star Wars Trilogy editions to be quite strange.  First there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released with a bonus features DVD included.  Then there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released WITHOUT features.  Then there's the new, limited Original Editions of the Star Wars Trilogy released on DVD but there isn't a bonus features DVD! <br /> <br />Why can't there be a Star Wars Trilogy edition released with both the originals and the special editions AND the bonus features DVD?  Wouldn't that save a lot of hastle?

B000F3AAUW|5.0|DJ/Producer Danger Mouse & rapper/singer/songwriter/producer/ex-Goodie Mob member Cee-Lo, collectively known as Gnarls Barkley, have joined forces to craft one of 2006's best and weirdest albums! What confuses me, however, is why their music is being labelled as Pop music.    Understandably, there are talented and creative forces in the world of Pop (Pink, Nelly Furtado, etc.), but the genre's generally the household of superficiality, mainstream predictability, talent-challenged Pop tarts and temporary heart-throbs. Unlike most run-of-the-mill Pop stars, Cee-Lo's vocals are strong, powerful, soulful and slightly raspy - the type that are easily capable of equalling, if not wilfully overpowering, Danger Mouse's insanely unconventional, upbeat production (see album opener \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\", where Cee-Lo unsubtly wails with maddening passion over Danger Mouse's boisterous horns). Then of course there's the UK-record-breaking #1 smash hit \\"Crazy\\", where Cee-Lo contemplates mental insanity over a dark, eerie beat.    Speaking of contemplation, it's obvious that Cee-Lo & Danger Mouse put a lot of effort into this stellar collaborative effort. From the crazy production to the singing to the rapping to the thought-provoking lyrics to the diverse subject matter, Gnarls Barkley manage to successfully throw all of their wacky ideas into a rather brief 37-40min.-long album and balance everything out to perfection. This type of album sure as Hell wasn't meant to be tailor-made for the pre-teen set.     On \\"Necromancer\\", Cee-Lo pervertedly details his sickening love for necrophilia over suitably haunting production, while \\"Just A Thought\\", \\"Smiley Faces\\" & \\"Who Cares\\" -all three of which talk about depression, pain and/or contemplative suicide- best exemplify the album's lyrical complexity. On top of all this, there's an infectious cover of the Violent Femmes' \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" - complete with bouncy xylophonic sound effects and electric guitar strings- and the schizophrenic\\"Transformer\\", where Cee-Lo rapidly raps and loudly sings the hook with the help of a few random (but different) vocal samples and/or effects, as well as Danger Mouse's super-fast production.    Well, does this album have any weaknesses? Believe it or not, this album really has no weaknesses. The comparatively short running time prevents the set from getting monotonous or self-indulgent (thanks for pointing that out AMG), and with just about no filler in sight, Gnarls Barkley have crafted a perfect debut album.     Only God knows what the f*** possessed these two nut-bags to create a concept album of such brilliance (though I doubt it was from \\"Feng Shui\\", as they stated on the track of the same name), but \\"St. Eslewhere\\" definitely a classic example of what can happen when artists motivate themselves enough to push musical boundaries in search of something more. 5 stars, easily!
6305313687|4.0|American History X is a very controversial film.  It is a definite favorite in my collection. This movie featuring Edward Norton goes in depth with a white serpremesist (spelling?) group and how in the end a main leader in the group is able to helphimself and his brother see life in a completely different way.  I won't give away anything, but there are ups and downs in the movie, but anyway you look at it, it is definently touching.  Some of it MAY be offensive, but I wasn't offended too much, and NO not because i AM white.  Just because I feel like the more I know the better off I am.  Of course it made me angry, but you have to shrug it off and realize this movie may change others for the better....A VERY moving film. A must buy. <br />
B000IOM0WY|4.0|THE ITALIAN JOB is billed as a remake of a popular Michael Caine movie from 1969, but it is so highly inventive in most aspects that it's really more of an original.  The movies still occupies itself with a daring robbery of gold bricks involving managing traffic and the use of mini-Coopers, and some of the characters even have the same names as the first movie.  However, the remake is a definite thriller that is guaranteed to stoke the adrenaline levels of watchers everywhere.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie Croker.  Donald Sutherland plays John Bridger, his criminal mastermind mentor.  It's this relationship, along with Charlize Theron as his estranged daughter Stella, that really drives the movies.  Edward Norton plays the bad guy, while Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G round out the crew.<br /><br />The movie opens with a fantastic bit that establishes the relationship between Croker and Bridger, then moves smoothly into an action riff that eats up screen footage and shows off Venice and the canals.  After a double-cross in the Swiss Alps, the movie skips ahead a year and introduces us to Stella Bridger.  Stella makes her living as a professional safecracker who uses her powers for good.  Charlie talks to her, telling her they've finally tracked down the man who killed her father, and he offers her a place on the team to get revenge.<br /><br />From that point on, the movie sprints forward into a rapid-fire game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the bad guy.  It plays out like a chess battle, but accelerated to tire-screeching hairpin twists and turns.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of the movies is awesome.  The video content is so clear in Venice that you'll swear you're on the canals yourself.  Director F. Gary Gray's pacing and shots are designed to thrill, and they do.  The picture is absolutely stunning.  The audio quality is pretty amazing as well, but the studio opted for the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound effect instead of going all out for uncompressed sound.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you do get a much better picture with the high-def version on a high-def monitor, but the sound could have been better.  You won't be upgrading your sound, but purchasing the disc will definitely upgrade your video presentation.  The special features included on the disc have already been packaged, so they don't add anything new.instead of going all out for uncompressed sound. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that you do get a much better picture with the high-def version on a high-def monitor, but the sound could have been better.

1594200823|5.0|Most of the reviews on this book obviously reflect the reviewers biases.  This book is a very easy to read and understandable explanation of the various processes by which we can get the food we eat.  The section on the industrial food chain focuses a little too heavily on corn, but he had to limit it somehow or the book would be overwhelming.  The way he followed corn from goverment policy and farming to fast food is effective and makes a lot of sense. <br /> <br />The section of the book dealing with organic and whole foods markets shows weakenesses in the system as well as some great examples of other options.  The last section on hunting his own meal was a little more self indulgent and not as much in line with the writing style of the others.  But it was entertaining. <br /> <br />This book has changed the way I look at the food I eat.  Everyone should be aware of the issues it raises.  I would reccomend it to anyone.

630562285X|5.0|It is always good to see Sean Connery but he and Zeta-Jones have very little to no chemistry as a team if that was intended. The film starts off well but their chemistry or relationship is rather strange if one even cares about that aspect. Caper films such as this have been done much better. The preparation scenes for the caper are a bore and look pretty unprefessional for characters who are supposed to be in this line of work. What this film needed was a good  director and a good editor as well. The film has a few good scenes thanks to Connery, but the film never reaches its potential.

B000ICLHIE|5.0|My only beef is with the sequencing.  I like Tom's ballads, but I'm less inclined to listen to a dozen in a row.  I'm interested in Wait's more aggressive and experimental tracks, so naturally I prefer discs 1 and 3.  Also, a project like this, made up of rarities and oddballs, demands extensive liner notes, info on who did what, when the tracks were recorded, etc.  The hefty booklet here only gives us a general list of the musicians involved.  I want the whole story.  That being said, there are plenty of great recordings, more than enough to justify the price of admission.  While I'm commenting, let me say that Waits, whose voice and performance style are often praised, doesn't get near enough recognition for his skills as a producer.  Tom's ability to manipulate sound is astounding, especially to a novice home recording enthusiast like me.  Through the use of unique instruments, inventive recording techniques, unusual sound sources and a whole lot of trail and error, Tom Waits creates records with a variety of textures unequalled by any other producer's body of work.  Orphans is a smorgasbord of studio magic.  Can you think of any other musician who can create the sound of paint peeling and iron rusting?
B00005JMAH|4.0|\\"Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" was My favorite Harry Potter movie yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|As this album proves, Loreena McKennitt is the queen of accurrate world music.  Nothing is overdone, sentimentalized (Yanni) or glossed over with recurring modern sophistications (Enya).  Her music is timeless, and this album is no exception.  Some have compared this release to Enya's previous album, Amarantine, saying there is too much familiarity with her previous work.  While that may be true, this much must be said: whether similar or not, the album is STUNNING.  Loreena's music is one of the only example of music that is accurate and hypnotic, deep and authentic, but it doesn't buckle under it's own weight or drift into territory with vague inspirations.  If you are interested in Loreena, I would start right here, a thoroughly current and wonderfully appropriate ode to an ancient muse. <br /> <br />Here is my track-by-track review of the album (for those of you who still aren't too sure): <br /> <br />The album begins with the haunting \\"Incantation,\\" which pulls the listener in to the theme of the album, bringing us to \\"The Gates of Istanbul,\\" which passes away in a \\"Gates of Istanbul\\", a song driven by a slight groove and accented by the various stringed instruments, pulling one to the regions of Turkey and the Far East.  The culmination of this Turkish sound that begins the album is \\"Caravanserai,\\" which begins subtly, meditatively, before gradually sweeping up in passion with Loreena's yearning voice and which concludes with a flurry of drums and what sounds like Middle-Eastern bagpipes.  This song is one of the standouts--a magnificent achievement. <br />  <br />Things take a different route with the instantly immortal \\"The English Layde and the Knight.\\"  Opening peacefully, a gorgeous choir summons the start of the story, and then breaks way to give attention to strings that sound like they're from a random year from long centuries past in an idyllic English village--almost renaissance...  The tale unfolds with Loreena's singing, but the mood of the song remains achingly beautiful, lifted to musical bliss by the recurring theme of the choir and the strings.  <br /> <br />\\"Kecharitomene\\" is a rousing, hypnotic piece that is delivered through a haze of brilliantly-synchronized foreign instruments that start out gracefully creating an atmosphere of the Far East, but by the end of the song, images of Mongols dancing around fires at midnight or of musicians wandering roads in ancient China are impossible to resist, and the song sweeps over you with its majestic horns and stringed instruments, held together by a passionate, recurring theme on a section of strings that reminds one of the Twelve Girls Band.  The piece ends after this ecstatic moment in a quiet way, as if the dancers are at last, well-spent and exhausted, on the ground.   <br /> <br />\\"Penelope's Song\\" follows, an intimate love song with more of the bagpipe-like instrument in \\"Caravanserai.\\"  Next is the interesting but un-magical \\"Sacred Shabbat,\\" which is followed by the more imaginative \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky,\\" a piece that lyrically educates and musically relaxes, like a moonlit journey across the Silk Road... <br /> <br />The closer to the album, the moving, heart-breaking \\"Never-Ending Road (Amhran Duit)\\" is one of Loreena's best pieces.  Reminding one of the intimacy in this album's own \\"Penelope's Song\\" and the immortal \\"Dante's Prayer\\" from her previous album The Book of Secrets, the track unfolds tenderly, almost painfully beautifully, as Loreena sings about the union of holding on AND moving on in the midst of love.  The lyrics are stunning, and her voice sounds like it is straight from her heart...  The song hypnotizes in an entirely different way than the rest of the album, by arresting the listener with the tender--but raw--emotion and depth of this woman's music and experiences.  It's a moving and apt conclusion to the best album of its genre category that I have ever heard.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Oh! Boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio multichannel surround System.This was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192kHz.Example ..Donald Fagen \\"Morph The Cat\\"or \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" dvd-audio disc..these dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.Today we have the so call Bonus Dvd Audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed  with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.If you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in \\"all channel Stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call DVD 5.1 disc.The stereo version of the Beatles LOVE album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended.
B000B8QF14|1.0|basically, this cd/dvd is documentation of green day's sloppiest, all time low, and over all worst tour ever. with the addition of so many band members onstage, why, i wonder, do billie mike and tre play sloppier? on this tour, mike misses many backing vocals, billie's guitar playing is at an all time sloppiness (embarassing for such an amazing guitarist). also, billie's guitar sounds are TERRIBLE, why can't he make his les paul juniors as powerful as they sound on the recordings? anyways, about this cd/dvd: it's nothing more than a handpicked selection of the most overplayed songs from the tour (their \\"greatest hits\\") with the banter completely cut out. it is very very dissapointing coming from a band who used to put on an amazing energetic live show. but.... if you are a new fan to the band or are young and stupid, then you will probably love this cd/dvd.
B000002AV5|5.0|This is the only Sade album you'll ever need. Great from beginning to end.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Let me say at the outset that I haven't heard this cd yet and I am not reviewing its quality or appeal.  I am merely questioning why this material is not left as the artists intended.  How is this process any different than movies being resized and cut to fit a tv screen.  The Martins are just a couple of technicians tooling with the music. Is there any reason, then, why any one of us cannot take a creation of any artist and splice and chop until we feel we can market it to the masses and make a buck?  Please understand, this cd may sound great, I just feel art should be left to those who create it,  and not after the fact tinkerers.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie was filled with magic wow. It was cool but weird.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|This latest Dvd-audio version of Morph the Cat is nothing short of breathtaking..the reason why i have a dvd-audio player in the first case.In a world of so many bogus fake Dvd disc and so call 5.1 mix,this a refreshing departure from the mediocre...there is nothing like the real deal..highly recommended.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|To state it simply - John, Paul, George and Ringo please take a bow! And a huge round of applause to George and Giles Martin. The music is still as good, if not better, than most of the current pop music. And now with this \\"mash-up\\", it shows it can compete with the top 40 out there on the radio today! Now please George, let Giles lend you his ears a little while longer and remaster the sounds of the original albums....it's long overdue! And we don't want anyone else \\"fiddling\\" with the remastering...it has to be done by the Master himself..with a little help from his son. Then we will let you retire peacefully....you've more than deserve it!
B00005JPCC|5.0|Martin Campbell did a great job directing this movie.  Daniel Craig did an awesome job as James Bond.  But I thought maybe Sean Connery might be better.  Second time I saw the movie today.

B00008DDXC|4.0|THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED, ENEMIES OF THE AIR BEWARE. This movie was cool and weirder than the first one.
B00005JPCD|5.0|This movie is another big step forward in computer animation. Action is livelier, textures are more lifelike, and even industrial geometries come to life forbiddingly. Fer cryin' out loud, they got fat dumpy penguins dancing like hot human babes - who'd have guessed? I'm jaded, though. I've come to expect artistic and expressive breakthroughs in computer animation. If they upend the whole game board on schedule, when they're supposed to, I can only be politely impressed.<br /><br />But I'm really impressed. They got everything right - even the people. If those were real people, esp. that little girl, then accept my apology, because I thought they were animations (except that bunch at the end). They got the mood right, family tensions (OK, not deep, but way over the bar for a kid's movie), determination, and making friends with folks who look different. They also offer some really cool water ballet, the kind you'd learn from the Blue Angels. This may be just a little intense at times, if you have small and skittish kids, but that's just because a world of carnivores has intense moments in it, like it or not. The mommy/daddy thing is tasteful, loving, and biologically vague.<br /><br />It's not just for kids, though. It has the kind of wit, the kind of musical and cultural literacy that keeps the grownups engaged, too. (You bought the tickets, you deserve at least as much as your young'uns.) Robin Williams bounces suitably off the wall, though not so much as in Robots. Everyone puts in good voices, which is kind of unfortunate. The real star power here came from the anonymous geeks who programmed the physics for penguin bone and blubber, then put a human spirit into it. Maybe it's a compliment that the great voice actors sank so silently behind their characters - I'm more impressed by the mathematical feat of computing how fuzz on baby penguins catches the light, then forcing me and everyone else into an \\"Awww, cute!\\" response by means of that arithmetic mastery.<br /><br />I could pick a few nits, like the very odd schedule on which Mumble sheds his juvenile coat so long after his peers, but only a few. And, if I did, it just wouldn't be any fun. This movie is fun, not to make fun of. It's also a pretty fair 100-minute treat for fans of a capella music. It's not my style, but it finally made me understand why people buy movie soundtracks.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release<br /> <br />I could pick a few nits, like the very odd schedule on which Mumble sheds his juvenile coat so long after his peers, but only a few.

0385336691|5.0|As I am a `Virgin' as far as Lee Child's books are concerned, I was quite surprised to read on the fly leaf that the author is not American, particularly as the content of the book is pure American thriller. This type of book is not really my cup of tea and would certainly not have been the first book I would have picked off the shelf, but I get books sent to me both from publisher's author's and also my family use every occasion to buy me books as presents and this is where this one came from. <br /> <br />I have since learned that as far as thriller authors are concerned Lee Child is  flavour of the month, so it was with some interest that I sat down to read the book. The book is well structured. It has a beginning a middle and an end (you would be surprised how many books don't). Well written by an author who has researched his subject thoroughly and in Jack Reacher the leading character in the book he has portrayed an endearing modern day  hero, who grows on the reader as the book progresses. For anyone who loves thrillers particularly American based thrillers. This would be manna from heaven. For those who love the authors writing, I am preaching to the converted. For those who have not read his books, they are well worth reading. Try this one and perhaps then you will want to read his other books too.
B000AO8CCE|4.0|Ever the innovator, Miles continues along the fusion path on this album with his new electric quintet all the members of which have gone on to have great solo careers and read almost as a who's who list of jazz history: Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, John McLauglin and Josef Zawinul among others.  Not quite as way out there as \\"Bitches Brew\\" was to become and hence is a little more accessible but this is a very good representation of Miles' earlier electric fusion output.<br /><br />This version of the album is a real treat for fans too as the mini-lp replica sleeve design is very well executed and the mastering is very well done as well resulting in a very good sound quality and hence listening experience.  Recommended.
B00005JPCY|4.0|Déjà Vu is an engrossing picture that appeals to the inner longing of anyone who has ever wished to somehow go back in time and change things.  What better things to change than preventing the death of hundreds of innocent men, women and children in a horrific bomb attack by an American terrorist, and saving the girl of your dreams at the same time.     The movie starts as a straight investigative thriller and soon diverges into science fiction territory involving viewing the past, a la \\"The Dead Past\\" by Isaac Asimov, and eventually physically traveling back in time.  Denzel Washington's acting convinces the audience that this is possible and in this and other ways carries the film with his performance of a dedicated, affable, and noble man.   I have seldom seen him in a role I liked better.      There are many clever twists and turns that add credence to the movie's premise, and a number of edge of your seat situations, including a chase sequence that occurs simultaneously in two different times that has to be seen to be believed.    My only reservation is the PG-13 rating, as the mass murder at the beginning of the film is realistic enough to give an impressionable mind Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the graphic evidence of torture found at an autopsy along with scenes of mayhem and murder are not suitable for younger audiences.  There is also a strong element of voyeurism and brief nudity.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film is shocking! It's about time someone gives us the truth of our ways.  This is the most wasteful society, all about convenience.  Hopefully everyone will see this movie and make changes to cleaner fuel and energy and stop wasting our precious resources.  Our children deserve a planet to live on.  Al Gore, you did us all a great service making this movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Pixar is amazing. There is no way of picking a favorite from pixar. Every movie they make is so original, funny and heartfelt. The really put their hearts into every movie they make.<br /><br />This movie is about a car who is selfish and through a life changing expericence with a small town, who changes into a good car.<br /><br />Great detail to everything in this film, down to every little tire mark on the roads and to the trip to california when you see different landmarks in different states.<br /><br />Nicole M*
B00004VVND|5.0|i was one of the first people in the world to see \\"WESTWORLD\\" when it came to the theatre (1973). didn't realize this til years later when i bought the dvd. the one with the 8 page booklet (not the cheaper priced dvd)<br /><br />  in it they say it was released in 4 major cities one week prior to the films actual release. i was on vacation with family when i was a kid and was fortunate enough to get to see it. was a great movie to see in the theatre.<br /><br />  we we're in Lakewood, OH at the \\"WESTGATE MALL\\". i remember the main character being chased by a gunslinger. for those of you who don't know the character Yul Brynner played in the movie was based on his \\"MAGNIFICENT SEVEN\\" portrayal (the man in black).<br /><br />  even when he's shot, burned. he never breaks character and is still wearing his hat! this is a movie on Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. from start to finish it is a great movie.<br /><br />  if i'd complain at all is that we don't see more of \\"MEDIEVIL\\" or \\"ROMAN\\" world. the movie wasn't about those parts of the \\"AMUSEMENT PARK\\". pre-JARRRASIC PARK. we are focused with \\"WESTWORLD\\" an amusement park of the \\"OLD WEST\\". where you can be a sheriff. have a shoot-out, rob a bank, or have sex with the prostitues at the whore house.<br /><br />  if you can think it the park will make it come true for you. thing is you better be ready to pay for the price of the admittion, WITH YOUR LIFE!!!<br /><br />enjoy<br /><br /> CMH
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I want to thank Al Gore for devoting his time and energy to such an important issue.  He presented the informaion extremely well with visuals complimenting the material.

0618680004|5.0|Once again, Richard Dawkins sings praises to the wondrous results of evolution. His insights provide me with a deep sense of awe and gratitude that nature's process of picking, sorting, choosing, and rejecting genes has resulted in my being here to enjoy our world. The underlying message that I gleaned from The God Delusion (and from his other books) is that the physical and psychological entities that connect us all are far more important than those that divide us. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the myths of the organized religions divide us deeply and unnecessarily. It should be clear to any rational observer that unless we overcome these divisions in the very near future, civilization and possibly humanity itself is doomed to the extinction afforded many other failed experiments of evolution. <br /> <br />Why do those who espouse religious faith uncritically accept so many notions that fly in the face of established scientific evidence? Dawkins examines this problem in great detail. Humans have been most reluctant to conceive that the object of their religious devotion might wish for them the same degree of maturity that their own parents bestowed upon them. Our parents, when we leave their nest, are sad to see us go but proud that they have helped us become self-sufficient and productive members of society. How disappointed God must be to see that the faithful among us still depend on him to guide their lives in the greatest detail, count on him to protect them from problems well within their control, and do good deeds only because they live in terror of what he will do to them if they don't. <br /> <br />Dawkins is joined by Sam Harris (Letter to a Christian Nation, The End of Faith) and Daniel Dennett (Breaking the Spell) in elaborating the toxic effects that the organized religions are having on human progress. These courageous scholars are pointing the way to rational and deeply satisfying alternatives to blind faith.  <br /> <br />
B000H30B2C|5.0|I believe this movie was the best movie of the year, a very close runner up was Batman Begins.<br /><br />This movie was beautiful. I loved how the changed the story a little. Instead of a dingy screaming blonde that King Kong is chasing after, they made the blonde girl, Noami Watts, a smart, loving, caring woman who loved King Kong and was his best friend.<br /><br />I also liked how they changed the blonde girls love interest from the actor, to a plain joe type. Great actors in this film. Jack Black was great. Noami Watts deserved some type of award for this part.<br /><br />I loved the scene when King Kong finds Noami Watts in the city and he slides around on the ice as he holds her.
B000IZJZLM|3.0|I will keep this review short and sweet.  I recently saw these talented guys open for Barbra Streisand in San Jose, CA.  They have booming voices, great prescence, potential, etc....however, their producers need to pick new songs and not have them sing songs that have been done a million times over and done better.  Also, they have now released 4 cd's since early 2005!  Their management needs to take them into the studio, take their time and put out something stellar!  They are MORE THAN CAPABLE OF IT!  I don't fault the guys for this lackluster release, I fault their management team!
B00005NFLB|5.0|It is rare for a sequel to surpass an original, and that is even less likely the more numbers you add to it.  This movie is not as good as the original, but it is still very enjoyable.<br /><br />The original was a Spielberg film based on a Crichton novel.  While Spielberg's influence is still there, he allowed Joe Johnston to take his place in the director's chair.  The credits state that it features characters created by Crichton, but unlike the first two, it is not based on Crichton's work.<br /><br />There are changes to make it fresher.  The raptors have a makeover, the Pteradactyls (which were in the original novel) make a movie debut, and the spinosaurus steals the show.  Additionally, my favorite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus, makes a couple of cameos, though they have no role in the story.<br /><br />The movie's hero, Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) was consipiously absent from \\"The Lost World\\", with the cynical Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) taking his place.  Malcolm and John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) are missing from this movie, while Grant and his then girl-friend and still good friend (Laura Dern) return in this installment.<br /><br />Why do I like this picture the best of the three?  Because of the human story.  Like the original and unlike \\"The Lost World\\", the characters stand their own in a world of special effects dinosaurs.  The story of this movie deals with friendships and respect.  It includes the healing of a family.  I felt good emotionally when the closing credits started, as well as being wow-ed by the technology and visual images.<br /><br />Like the first movie, this would be a good one to have a discussion after.  In this case, though, the discussion can move to friendships and family, rather than philosophical topics.
1583762027|4.0|Like many, I'm sure you've been faced with an overwhelming or ugly task that you just keep putting off.  Brian Tracy covers some ways to get out of that rut in the book Eat That Frog! 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time.  This is one of those reads that is probably best if you've never delved into self-improvement or time management books before...<br /><br />Contents: Set the Table; Plan Every Day in Advance; Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything; Consider the Consequences; Practice the ABCDE Method Continually; Focus on Key Result Areas; Obey the Law of Forced Efficiency; Prepare Thoroughly Before You Begin; Do Your Homework; Leverage Your Special Talents; Identify Your Key Constraints; Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time; Put the Pressure on Yourself; Maximize Your Personal Powers; Motivate Yourself into Action; Practice Creative Procrastination; Do the Most Difficult Task First; Slice and Dice the Task; Create Large Chunks of Time; Develop a Sense of Urgency; Single Handle Every Task; Conclusion - Putting It All Together; Learning Resources of Brian Tracy International; Index; About the Author<br /><br />The \\"frog\\" mentioned here is the old adage about eating frogs first thing in the morning.  If you eat the ugliest frog first, everything else will seem easy by comparison afterwards.  All the suggestions and ideas that Tracy presents are tied back into the \\"frog\\" theme, which make the chapters a bit easier to remember and help to lend a cohesive feel to all the material.<br /><br />On the positive side, these suggestions do work to help you become more efficient at whatever you're doing.  As you can probably tell from each chapter title, the concepts are pretty much common sense, but they're easy to ignore or overlook when you're in the downward spiral of overwork.  Given that each chapter is only two to four pages, it's not a laborious task to grasp the concept being presented so that you can apply it to your particular situation.  On the down side, if you've read any self-improvement or efficiency books before, most of this will be familiar to you.  I don't know how much new stuff you'll come away with.  And if you're a follower of the Getting Things Done method of personal productivity, you'll likely have issues with the reliance on lists and prioritizing your to-do list.<br /><br />It's a fun, quick read, and a single idea might be all you need to make a large leap forward in your personal productivity.  Just don't expect any groundbreaking, original stuff.n.  On the down side, if you've read any self-improvement or efficiency books before, most of this will be familiar to you.

B000H30B2C|4.0|After his great success with (and some might say, overexploitation of) \\"The Lord Of The Rings,\\" Peter Jackson turned his attention to yet another desired project - \\"King Kong.\\"  It's obvious how much he loved it (one merely has to review some of the bonus material in the original's DVD rerelease to see that), and the source material HAS been improved in some cases, but one can see with both the theatrical cut and this \\"extended\\" edition, much bloat has been added, a la Lucas, in order to \\"make a classic even better.\\"  Sometimes, though, improved scenery and realism in the effects, and adding more material, just plain gets in the way of what is, was, and always will remain, a simple story that succeeds BECAUSE it's simple. <br /> <br />For the most part, Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" is refreshing.  I love the original because it tried to tell an adventure story that mingles reality with fantasy.  Back in the day, this was a hard thing to do because it actually meant having to physically MAKE the effects happen.  Here, Jackson plays to his strengths because he, and the geniuses at WETA, show the exact same effort with a modern method - one can see how they slaved over the digital shots to make them fit into reality.  He did the same thing, to phenominal effect, in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"  He and the writers also know that today's audiences don't need for the script to be simplistic in order to keep us entertained.  If the story is well-told, we're willing to sit through character development and genuine emotion-building moments.  In showing us a sweet, platonic, and doomed connection between human woman and giant male ape, Jackson gives us a payoff the original only hinted at. <br /> <br />Yet when we see this over three-hour enterprise, I get the feeling that less truly would've been more.  The original clocked in at just over an hour.  The theatrical release came in at under three.  Even that felt a little heavy.  I can't really put my finger on what would've been better to cut (although I think we could've done less with the wonders of Skull Island), but I think we could've spent less time watching it as a whole and still gotten one Hell of a ride from this retelling. <br /> <br />All and all though, the Extended Cut IS interesting.  The wonders of digital film media is that, once you watch the whole movie, YOU can decide what to watch and not watch, thus shorten the film experience the way YOU want to.  It makes the whole thing worthwhile in the end.  And I'll be honest - I'd rather see the complete vision of the storytellers the first time around anyway.
B000IZJZLM|2.0|I preface my review of Siempre by stating I'm a huge Il Divo fan and have seen them in concert once.  It was an amazing show!  I frequently listen to their first two albums, which I really enjoy.  However, my least favorite Il Divo songs are the ones where they take a once popular English song and transform it into a version in another language.  With that said, I'm somewhat disappointed with Siempre.  Of the nine new songs, most of them fit the pattern I mentioned before.  This time, they chose songs that I'm either tired of or didn't like the first time around.  So here I sit with a new CD I have no desire to listen to again.  I'm hoping it will grow on me.
6303148352|5.0|I have a friend who thinks Steven Spielberg basically is a B-movie maker.  Actually, Spielberg takes B-movies, and transforms them into A-movies.  This is a case in point.  It is full of dazzling special effects, yet the human actors stand on their own, with performances that keep your attention.  The pacing also is excellent, with intense action broken up with character development, some philosophizing, and plenty of humor to make the suspense more effective.<br /><br />One thing that Spielberg effectively does is introduction of characters.  This movie is an example of this.  The first time a dinosaur is actually seen is very effective, and the same is true with the first appearance of the Tyrannosaurus.<br /><br />I would divide science fiction into three categories:  1) true science fiction, that is based on realistic speculation; 2) science fantasy, which is non-realistic (e.g. Star Wars); and 3) science horror, which is a horror story in a science fiction setting.  I would consider the book to be true science fiction; the movie creeps more into the science horror category.<br /><br />I mentioned the book, written by Michael Crichton (who also worked on the screenplay).  People who read the book first liked the book better, as is often the case with movies based on books.  I saw the movie first, and I realize that there is a difference in the two.  The purpose of the book is to show the dangers of genetic engineering, when man enters the realm of God.  While this point is not absent from the movie, the purpose of the latter was to be a money making exciting blockbuster movie, which it succeeded at.<br /><br />This explains some of the changes; for example, some characters that survive the book die in the movie, and vice versa.  John Hammond is more likable in the movie than he is in the book.  Some of the changes are to make the picture more enjoyable, and some are probably to keep the people who read the book guessing.<br /><br />One last comment.  I am a recent creationist, which means I believe dinosaurs and man co-existed.  There are people who share my beliefs that think Jurassic Park promotes evolution.  I disagree strongly.  I have no doubt that Spielberg and Crichton are evolutionists.  However, the references to evolution in the movie are not strong enough to indoctrinate anybody.  The plot for this movie would work as well from my point of view as from an evolutionary point of view.<br /><br />So, if you want to be well-entertained for a couple of hours, this is an excellent way to achieve that goal.am a recent creationist, which means I believe dinosaurs and man co-existed.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I am, was, and always will be a Beatles Lover! To me the Beatles music is on the top of the all time music pinacle. Any and everything else starts miles below in my opinion both quality, excellence, variety and just everything in every way about music. I am  56 years old, and haved loved everything about the Beatles for over 4 decades now, with no foreseeable end to my love of this music. <br /> <br />Anyway, IF you are anything like me, I have to report the \\"new\\" album, The Beatles LOVE, is nothing short of a true masterpiece. It is created from the original masters created by the genious George Martin over 40 years ago. Him and his son, Giles, in collaboration with the creators of Cirque du Soleil, created a Cirque show from this music. (That I get to go see in a few weeks in Las Vegas) and the album collection was released last week as both a CD and a set that has a CD and an Audio DVD.  <br /> <br />The sounds, and songs are like no Beatle song you have heard, but yet are totally familiar. The mix of parts and pieces of songs, and how they transition is beyond words to describe.  <br /> <br />My only regret (WARNING HIPPIE CHILD about to speak) is that I cant listen to this stoned out of my face HAHAHAH . But alas adult responsibilities and mandatory drug testing pervade our society *sigh* <br /> <br />It is just to absolutely lose yourself in the most decadant of musical escapes. <br /> <br />The Audio DVD has a clarity, and musical layers of separation that just boggles the mind, and moves the soul. Just a tip here, IF you listen on a DVD player,  turn your tv ON and use the onscreen controls to select your audio output. I did not do this first time around and it uses the default PGM Audio. Using that, a few songs had a long pause, and even stopped at one point. Once I changed to Dolby 5.1, it not only did not do that annoying pause/stop, but the sound improved greatly! <br /> <br /> <br />OK, I must waft back down to reality now.. But seriously , IF you likethe Beatles, you will just LOVE this work of art! <br />
B00004YRM2|3.0|Like Jurassic Park, \\"The Lost World\\" is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, who was a co-writer on both screenplays.  The original novel was darker than the movie; this movie reflects that darkness.<br /><br />The main character is Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), a supporting role in the original, and a non-surviving character in the book.  The only other movie character that has a role more than a cameo is John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a character that likewise did not survive the book.  To me, the first hint on the tone of the movie was to make cynical Malcolm the star instead of the more typical heroic Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) from the original.  Even the humor is darker.<br /><br />The first scene in this sequel is actually from the opening of the original novel (I have not read the novel \\"The Lost World\\"), partially used because it introduces a dinosaur not in the original movie, though these critters played a role in the original novel.<br /><br />This sequel, though, is more of a horror story than a true science fiction story.  Its goal is to terrify you.  As a result, many of the human characters are meant to be victims for the monsters (e.g. dinosaurs), instead of characters you really care about.<br /><br />This movie follows the formula of the original movie:  1) an attack by a dinosaur; 2) an introduction to why the characters come to the island; 3) some wonderful dinosaur footage, and lighter hearted plot/character development; 4) the attack of the tyrannosaur(s); 5) more action; 6) the attack of the velociraptors; and 7) the rescue of the survivors.  This sequel does add a second ending, where a tyrannosaur is allowed to roam the streets of San Diego as you would expect from a B-grade horror movie.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, this will be to your liking.  It is well crafted as far as the special effects.  However, I would not recommend this movie.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|This one grows on you, just like his first album. It stops short of reinventing the style but does a very good job not repeating O. For example, here we have electric guitars, more percussion, production that goes from very simple to often masterful in the same track. At first listen a song like Rootless Tree is a simple then offensive, but after a few listens Damien fans will hear the brilliance in it.<br /><br />This isn't music manufactured to hook you in between radio ads. With music being the way much of it is today, I've found that I've \\"tuned my ears\\" to the templated song, waiting for the quick hook so I can absorb it, listening a few times then throw it away, but you can't do that with Damien's music and if you approach it that way you're likely to pass his work off as simple folk music. But if you listen trying to search for what he's trying to say, if you seach for the soul of the artist you'll find no mask on this album. 9 is a coherent work, it is a brilliant album every bit as good as O, if anything it has more variety than O. I think a lot of people will say, there's no Blowers Daughter or there's no Cannon ball on 9. I guess I don't understand those comments, because I always thought of those songs as just part of the sum of that album. I never thought they defined that album as a great album. 9 doesn't have a few stand out tracks , but it has a lot of brilliant moments spread out across the album.<br /><br />One quick historical note. Track 3, \\"Elephant\\" was originally titled \\"The Blowers Daughter, Part II\\" and has been showing up in live sets for a long time now.
B00005JPCY|5.0|\\"Deja Vu\\" is excellent! The third re-teaming of Denzel Washington-Tony Scott-Jerry Bruckheimer combo is excellent and smart and one of the original films of the year. The directing by Tony Scott (his third go-round with Denzel Washington since \\"Crimson Tide\\" (1995) & \\"Man On Fire\\" (2004) & his sixth go-round with Jerry Bruckheimer since \\"Top Gun\\" (1986) is excellent. The story and screenplay by Bill Marsilii & Terry Rossio (who is known for his work on the \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\\" trilogy) is excellent. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (the sixth go-round with Scott since \\"Enemy Of The State\\" (1998) is excellent. The cinematography by Paul Cameron (his third go-round with Scott since \\"Beat The Devil\\" (2002) is excellent. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (his seventh go-round with Scott since \\"Top Gun\\") & Jason Hellmann (who also film edited Bruckheimer's \\"Glory Road\\" (2006) is excellent. The casting by Kerry Barden, Billy Hopkins (his second go-round with Scott since \\"True Romance\\" (1993), Suzanne Smith, & Denise Chamian (her second go-round after Scott's recent pic \\"Domino\\" (2005) is excellent. The production design by Chris Seagers (his third go-round with Scott since \\"Man On Fire\\") is excellent. The art direction by Drew Boughton (his second go-round after Scott's recent pic \\"Domino\\"), Gary Diamond, & Scott Plauche is excellent. The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg is excellent. The costume design by Ellen Mirojnick is excellent. This is one of the most original films of the year. This is smart, excellent, and well-paced. This is another one of Tony Scott's hits.
B00004Y3OU|5.0|Just some general comments here, since I hardly need to get into talking about CP itself (which is a modern masterpiece no matter which way you look at it):<br /><br />It is absurd to assume, as some here have implied, that all Director's Cut versions are garbage. They are not just merely offered in order to glean a few more bucks from audiences, many of whom never saw the original in the first place, especially in the case of foreign films.<br /><br />Yes, when several scenes have been added, not all may fit within the familiar framework of what one might remember from a previous viewing. Well, that's just like life, isn't it?<br /><br />And, in particular, it's just like the cinema.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I bought this version of the movie with hopes of it being frickin' awsome...and when I got home and popped it in I WAS RIGHT! This is the best special edition EVER!It's even better than the LOTR Box sets(Which I might add are also pretty sweet).I've loved this movie before I bought the Spec. Edition, but this just makes it better.I suggest that if you are a big fan of either Bruce Campbell or just The Evil Dead trilogy you should BUY!There are extras that would give any B Film lover a Campbellgasm.<br /><br /> Sincerely<br /><br />  \\"Groovy\\" Kyle
B000003KMM|5.0|Bollywood loves to churn out action films, but the Indians could learn some lessons from the Jewish-American cartel in Hollywood concerning story construction from this classic sport melodrama presented in the traditional three act format - three 40-minute blocks to produce a 2-hour movie.  Much is done brilliantly in the construction of the film and its story.  In the opening scene, the antagonist is introduced and hooks the viewer when she reveals the premise and plot - a rotten season where attendance falls below 800,000 for the year will allow her to escape her lease with the city and relocate her recently inherited Cleveland Indians baseball team to Miami, so she's invited has-beens and screwballs to training camp with the aim of composing a team that stinks enough to cause attendance to drop.<br /><br />The remainder of the scenes in the first act introduce the protagonist (the catcher played by Tom Beringer) and all the main characters: Team Coach, Born-Again Pitcher, Voodoo Man, Pretty Boy, Willy Mays Hayes, and Wild Thing.  Nice subplots and tensions are introduced between these unforgettable characters, after which the main subplot is presented between the catcher and his ex-fiancee.  All of these characters have no idea that the team's new owner expects them to stink - they're all playing and coaching with determination.  But Act One ends with them playing their first game and losing 9-0.<br /><br />Act Two opens with a scene in the office where the owner is complaining to the General Manager that the team is bad, but it doesn't stink.  And she complains that there is even some improvement.  So she increases the complications for the characters by taking away their perks and making them fly in a propeller plane rather than a jet.  While they continue to lose , subplots and tensions continue between the characters.  However, they also continue to show improvement especially when Coach notices that Wild Thing's pitching would improve if he wore glasses.  The owner responds with more complications - their propeller plane is replaced by a bus.  By the end of Act Two, their record is 60 wins and 61 losses.  That's when the plot is given its turning point - Coach finds out that none of them will have a job in baseball after the season ends because they were hired to lose.  After Coach shares this with the players, the catcher says there is only one option available to them - win the whole darn thing (as winners, they could work for another team next season).  The players will need 32 victories to stay in baseball after this season.<br /><br />Act Three begins 31 victories later when they have to play the Yankees for the championship, who they've struggled against all season.  This act is 41 minutes of inning-by-inning action, conflict, and suspense.  In melodramatic fashion, they win! It's an awesome climax to a succession of dramatic suspense scenes. And in Hollywood subplot fashion, the catcher gets his girl.s.  The owner responds with more complications - their propeller plane is replaced by a bus.

B000JJ4GW0|5.0|U218 Singles is a two-disc collection showcasing some of the best songs U2 has ever created, although I wish they had included Electrical Storm.<br /><br />On the CD there is a new clarity in the energy of Bono's voice and on the second disc the sound is more raw and real (Live from Milan) with audience participation and Bono's witty comments and repartee. This brought new meaning to \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" which has always seemed to affect me on a deep level.<br /><br />Spiritual and Sensual, Bono breathes passion into every song with emotional ecstasy in lyrics like \\"all I want is you.\\" I figured out why I love his songs so much. He says things I want to hear and he also captures the excitement of love in all its many forms and revelations. His poetic lyrics can drive any romantic heart a little crazy, while he retains a very edgy masculine appeal.<br /><br />This album is a moment you won't mind being stuck in and it captures the excitement of the U2 experience that encompasses many musical angles from soothing melodious comfort to sharp awareness of what it truly means to be alive in a world filled with conflict. In one song, Bono changes the song into a prayer and makes this a beautiful moment in time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B00005JGAF|5.0|Unlike some reviewers here, I didn't exactly grown up in the punk era of the late 70s/early 80s.  Yeah I was around, but the diaper rash kinda hampered my appreciation for the genre.  I kind of backed into the Ramones in high school after wondering where Green Day got their ideas from (and I am happy to say that once I heard the real thing I dropped Green Day and started buying albums from the likes of the Ramones, Talking Heads, The Clash, Devo, etc. etc.).  This music wasn't really THAT old when I first discovered it, and it has really stuck with me through all my phases.<br /><br />Anyway, in this era of emo, mall-punk, sloppy pseudo-hardcore and the like, it's refreshing to throw this one on the player and remember that punk rock can be far from the cheesy and awkward \\"devolution\\" which has occurred.  Perhaps this fact alone shows the limitations of the genre as well.  I mean, there is by definition only so much you can really do with a few chords and a lot of nervous or angry energy.  That potential was largely maxed-out by around 1986 (although you never know, some would have said the same about 50s rock n roll).  The point is, nothing that has happened since the release of this album takes anything away from its superior quality and the absolute pop PERFECTION of these rock n roll nuggets.  It's got an angry Beach Boys sound that was stunningly unique for its time, and it's just so much fun to listen to nearly anywhere.  If you like punk rock, this should be the first stop you make.<br /><br />-HW
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The first time I noticed the album cover, I was completely intrigued with the distant snow-capped mountains and invitation into a cozy magical tent, you might just happen upon in a magical forest. The music was worth the wait, with moments that delivers on the promise of mystery. Once you enter the mood, it remains consistent throughout and can create a world in which to relax or escape.<br /><br />\\"Pray for their souls who died for love,<br /><br />For Love shall still be lord of all\\"<br /><br />The highlight of this album seemed to be \\"The English Ladye and the Knight\\" until I heard \\"Penelope's Song\\" that is even more impressive. The lyrics are romantic and dreamy:<br /><br />\\"Long as the day in the summer time<br /><br />Deep as the wine dark sea<br /><br />I'll keep your heart with mine.<br /><br />Till you come to me.\\"<br /><br />This track is followed by a purely instrumental \\"Kecharitomene\\" with ancient echoes and Celtic worlds mingling as one in an enchanting fusion. The songs have a sacred quality enhanced greatly by the soft beauty in Loreena McKennitt's voice.<br /><br />The instrumentation throughout is of rare beauty with \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky\\" capturing the very heart of the muse. The entire album is not only a mesmerizing listening experience; it is an escape into mystery where Loreena McKennitt whispers your soul awake.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000BTC5LW|4.0|First, the DVD is great.  Let me get that out of the way.  But I must warn those that have seen \\"The Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" concert, the female vocal solos  (Great Gig In The Sky) that made your hair stand on end, that made life worth living, that brought hope in mankind forever, that made the most cold-hearted sob with emotion...yeah those...well...they are a HUGE disappointment on Pulse.  The first soloist was good, a level below all three solos on DSOT, but solid.  But your thinking, \\"she was first so we're gonna get better as we go\\".  Nope.  They're \\"pretty\\", but  just not the the journey to the center of our being that you got in DSOT.  <br />Disclaimer:  If you've never seen DSOT, this won't be a problem for you.  Enjoy the lovely voices. <br />
B0001I55SS|3.0|I really liked this film when I was younger, but seeing it again, it sadly doesn't hold up particularly well, at least scriptwise.  It has a great premise, but its execution is pedestrian.  Honestly, even when I was a kid, I think I just cut the movie some slack because I was naive, but I kind of knew it was a rather pedestrian film.  You'd think with Disney's money and the talented cast here (including the great Maximilliam Schell as the captain of the doomed ship), they could have done something really fantastic, but they didn't.  It's a rather simplistic rendering of a great idea.  True, it's considered a kids' movie by many (although it was the first Disney movie to get a PG rating, which was a real big deal back in those days), but still, you'd think they try something deeper.<br /><br />The film, however, looks astonshingly good today.  The special effects are quite good, the ship is immense and fascinating, and the film was shot in 70mm and looks it.  Unlike another dated Disney movie, Tron (which was also PG, shot in 70mm, but is SO DATED now), this film still looks good.  I only wish the script was better.  Still, I like to watch it now and again.
B0002858YS|1.0|A friend recommended that I should get their CD because they rock! So I did. Boy were they wrong!!! These guys suck big time. Just another cookie cutter pop/rock (boring) band of today. I will never buy a CD of these guys ever again and I will never listen to my ex-friend!!
B00004RFFI|2.0|This is a terrible, terrible movie.  Stupid characters, junk plot, moronic dialogue, I really couldn't wait for it to end.  I got dragged to see it, and I just remember, is this the best film that they can make?  I remember Philip Seymour Hoffman was in this, and I wanted to belt his character with a shovel (or equally heavy instrument).  All of the stormchasers are kinda idiotic, and if these people were real, they would probably be killed.  The performances simply consist of Bill Paxton and crew getting debris thrown at them for 2 hours.  People scream a lot in the film, too.  It's just wretched.  Watch the weather channel if you dig tornadoes.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|What's all this talk about what kind of music this guy makes on this album. Is it pop, is it R&B, is it blues? Who cares! This is just great music!! Very rarely is find an album on which ALL songs are appealing. This is one. Some songs even give me goosebums. Every time I hear them. BUY THIS RECORD. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
B00009ATIX|1.0|When the remake of Tarkovsky's Solaris was announced, I went ballistic.  I cursed, I threw things, I went into a rage because they were remaking (don't give me that \\"reimagining\\" crap) one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, and were remaking a Tarkovsky film (!).  Remaking a Tarkovsky film?!?!?!?  Absolutely sacrelige.  Next, they will be \\"reimagining\\" the Sistine Chapel.  I saw about half of this film, and I had to shut it off to prevent myself from doing bodily harm to myself and the TV.  How many times did the sod (a British slur term in which I will refer to Soderbergh as for the rest of this review) watch 2001 and Solaris before making this?  The cover box on the DVD is a blatant ripoff of the famous picture/poster of Dave Bowman in his spacesuit with the blinking lights on it.  There are shots that look just like HAL 9000's eye in 2001 (except the eye is bigger.  Wow, what an amazing idea, Sod!  Make it bigger!).  The dialogue is on the level on a high school drama.  Clooney (who is a good actor) is too straightforward and is not haunted enough.  He just looks old here, not necessarily sad, which is the way he should look.  Nastasha McElhone reads her lines without any emotion at all.  The rest of the crew (especially Jeremy Davies turn as the \\"stoned\\" guy) are a bad joke.  In Tarkovsky's original film, every member of the cast had dignity, and the film was really profound and mysterious, a true epic sci-fi film worthy of comparisons to 2001.  Here, it's dumbed down.  It takes the guise of an \\"important\\" film, but it isn't.  It's just a remake, and a bad one at that.  Sod has a rep for being an artistic filmmaker, but a lot of his films are remakes of much better foreign films (Traffic is a remake of a far superior British miniseries, for example).  He is very overrated.  He said this was his most ambitious film.  Ambition doesn't mean copying Kubrick and Tarkovsky, sod.  Avoid this.  Stanislaw Lem, the author of the original novel, didn't like either version, but he acknowledged that Tarkovsky had a vision at least.  He said the sod was a hack, and he's right.  Watch Tarkovsky's original masterpiece.  It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.sion, but he acknowledged that Tarkovsky had a vision at least.  He said the sod was a hack, and he's right.  Watch Tarkovsky's original masterpiece.  It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the Firefly series over the course of the last month, and culminated my Joss Whedan experience by watching Serenity.  The movie is great: is has witty dialogue, great characters, and a quick plot wonderfully interwoven with Western and scifi themes.  Watch this movie and fall in love with the Firefly series, or watch the Firefly series and then fall in love with the movie.  Either way, curse the shortsighted Fox executives that killed a wonderful little drama.
B000K5FPNW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and a classic in the genre.    Just watch it to be entertained, watch it to see an incredible imagination or really delve into the themes and questions it raises.  I love the story line and the \\"dirty realist\\" approach to some off the strange settings and places.    You can appreciate this movie on a number of levels, its story has ever twisting interesting events and the ending is a real surprise.
B000093BDX|1.0|marketing people at record companies have no scruples. how many times can you re package the same group of songs? especially when there's so much unreleased stuff the beach boys did which was brilliant (ie the original Smile album plus numerous studio outtakes and incendiary live sets which have surfaced on bootlegs over the years?!) Rather than piss your money away on this collection, save a few more dollars and buy the boys' box set, endless summer, or even made in the usa, which at least has two songs that are unavailiable anywhere else)
B00005JO1R|5.0|If your at all interested in Johnny Cash and like movies, you'll be pleased with this movie.
6304698690|5.0|I had been eying this movie up for quite a while on the shelf of my local library... and finally rented it. Took it home, expecting it to be vauge and lackluster, but was shocked and *pleasantly* surprised to see that it had great charm, beauty, and belivablilty. <br /> <br />Mary is portrayed not as cynical and spoiled brat, but rather more in the light of the child lacking in the love and compassion of her father and mother. The scenery? Simply magnificent. As for the magic... it simply puts this movie into more of the fairy tale genre. (C'mon, nobody minds The Little Mermaid? Aladdin? Beauty and the Beast?) A little discretion from you parents though is wise... I mean, the rating IS pg, you should be able to explain to your kids the foolishness and folly of magic. <br /> <br />And guys? I should know whether to negate it because of love for the book. I read the it 4+ times.  <br /> <br />Hope you enjoy it. I did. Very much.
034544678X|5.0|Amazing insight into why your dog does what she does. It is an interesting read. I would buy this book again in a heartbeat!
B00005ASOI|3.0|I watched this movie with high expectations - this being Dario Argento's best movie. However I was disappointed with the movie. The set design and the music are very effective however it is let down by the plot, dialogue and acting. <br />The movie did not make me feel scared or at all curious about what would happen - it was very predictable. As always the scenes where the poor victims meet their grisly ends are imaginative.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I just received this dvd set this afternoon (Thank you Amazon for a quick ship to Canada!) and it is by far the most impressive box set I have gotten.  I just love how all 5 seasons fit into the Rambaldi box and how easy it is to open and close back up.  I really got into Alias during it's second season but didn't find time to watch much of seasons 4 and 5, so having every single episode in one complete package is great!  This is a great set for any Alias fan that doesn't already have the individual seasons.
B000005RFQ|5.0|to quote a line from \\"Trashed.\\" I think Gillan is an individual with a history of kicking our butts with his Hippy Banshee wailing..Like the Head band he wears inside the album cover along with leather Indian like Jacket..I think he's got the \\"Great Spirit\\" looking out for him and making sure we're entertained. Ronnie James Mantle was not dropped when it passed oN..
0385336691|3.0|I've been hooked on Jack Reacher and Lee Child's exceptional writing since I read the Persuader.  Without Fail, Die Trying, Echo Burning, The Killing Floor, One Shot -- I can go on and on about these exceptionally entertaining, tightly written thrillers, and the unique,highly intelligent, explosive hottie Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Despite some unfortunate quirks, I love the Reacher character.  But it's the quirks and the plot holes that stood out for me this round.<br /><br />4 days in the same clothes, with one of those nights spent staked out on a stoop?  In New York? Oh please. A man who does not change his underwear for days and gets the girl -- that is so totally unbelievable and detracted away from the plot.<br /><br />Reacher doesn't know about text messaging?  Makes him a bit of a dinosaur.<br /><br />All the cars that were central to the plot and not one of them had a tracking device?  Oh please.<br /><br />Reacher has no paperwork, but he just happens to have a passport?  Oh please.<br /><br />Reacher's sense of inner timing started making him sound like an obsessive-compulsive Big Ben.  I waited and waited to find out why this was mentioned over and over and over again, why it was central to the plot -- to no avail.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  The beginning was pure Child genius, as was the end, especially the pacing at the climax.  And the scene with the veteran amputee was exceptional. The theme of the loyalty and protection of women was very good. The rest was just filler and boring; and the mercenaries/bad guys were incompetent sticks.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version ready by Dick Hill. He did a fantastic job, but I had a hard time understanding the amputee.  I know the guy was supposed to be  toothless but I couldn't hear the words. Also (this could may be an engineering issue) some of Hill's lows were too low to hear, even when I cranked up the volume.<br /><br />The global problem is Reacher has not matured, not grown. He is ronin --rootless, paperless, homeless, with no belongings. That box is becoming a prison not a plot-driver. In this go-round, he is a cardboard cut-out.  I hope Lee Child does much better by this wonderful character next time.
0312319517|4.0|This is one of Frederick Forsyth's thrillers, a convoluted story that involves a Serbian thug who kills the wrong person, an American aid worker whose family is wealthy, and the guy who chases after him, a Viet Nam vet who has nicknamed himself \\"Avenger\\" and who specializes in not killing, but delivering to the authorities, people who have killed Americans. Forsyth is good at this sort of book, which remains his forte. The plot's involved, but not overly so, and the first half of the book is character development but relatively little real plot in the present tense of the book. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this novel a great deal. The Avenger's character is well-developed, and interesting. The bad guy was a bit of a cardboard cutout, but Serbian villains who are mass murderers tend to be pretty much the same, so I suppose that's not unreasonable. The author has a sideplot that involves Osama bin Laden et al, and it's a bit contrived, but interesting anyway. I would recommend this book.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|As i began this movie, i was disappointed. The main actress did not have the beautious presence of the protagonists in the adaptations of Mansfield Park, Emma, or the A&E Pride & Prejudice. The sets were not particularly vibrant, and the characters were, well, normal people. However as the movie progressed, i became impressed against my own first impression. Amanda Root brings forth the spellbinding silence and oppression of intelligent, regretful young ladies, with smaller claims to youth and beauty than others. Her pain is so tangible, and her loneliness so palpable, you can't help but feel for the accomplished and overlooked Anne. Like Sense and Sensibilities Colonel Brandon, in Willoughby's words, she is \\"the man (in this case woman) that everyone speaks well of, but no one remembers to talk to\\". As the film progresses she seems to become prettier and livelier, and her repression begins to lift, and you see her true geniality and open-heartedness. As for Ciaran Hinds...well, not only is he handsome, but he plays his part with such feeling and passion that you can't help but wait in anticipation for the inevitably happy conclusion. Both parts are semi-stereotypical...Anne, who mistakenly turned down her true love due to the faulty advice of her friend, pines and diminishes, becoming quiet and somber in near self-induced solitude. Wentworth, being the man, seeks occupation overseas and tries to forget her. He can't, however he is less forgiving, being the one spurned so many years ago, and you spend half the movie agonizing over his attentions to the unaccomplished, flirtatios, more beautiful Louisa. All in all, a good watch, with the feeling and sad repression of true love that makes Austen amazing. Anne and Wentworth are not as funny as Darcy and Elizabeth, but instead are reminiscent of the sensible, quiet adoration of such characters as Elinor and Colonel Brandon...not ostentatious, not overly flirtatious, but sensible and sad and loving and repressed. I lovedit...in fact, i'm going to go turn it on right now.
0393327655|5.0|Harris' polemical work, 'The End of Faith', is brilliant in its delivery and message.  If you are reading this review, you are probably familiar with the general thesis of the book so I won't regurgitate the book's contents here.  Suffice to mention, however, Harris systematically states, describes, and provides examples of why faith (and the religions engendered therein) are responsible for many of the world's past & present atrocities.  The only alternative, as he sees it, is a concerted movement toward empiricism and reason.  The flavor of this book could have been much more rant-like, but Harris manages to articulate his points with wit, panache, and punctuated absurdity.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is the best. Wheither or not the lyrics are similiar to anothers, it is still pretty darn good. If you think about most music is a newer version of country.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Best Christmas movie that I have seen in this decade.  Since I enjoy trains I was fascinated not only the train but also the winter scenery enroute to Christmas town.  I was dazzeled by all the Christmas decorations and the big Christmas tree.  Even Chistmas music was playing in the movie too.  When I saw this on a borrowed DVD, I loved it imediately so I too bought a copy for myself to add to my collection of Christmas DVDs.  When I saw that train pulling into town I was also singing out the tune of O Christmas Tree as I heard in the movie.  Next time when I see the movie once more I will also make myself a cup of hot chocolate.  I you have children get this DVD.  It is definatly worth it.  Don't forget to get some hot chocolate ready for them for refreshments.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Denzel Washington is a detective with a mission:  a raise, a promotion, getting his name cleared in a \\"misplaced drug money\\" case, and some respect.  Nothing more... no saving the world or anything.<br /><br />In the meantime, a bank robbery begins, with multiple hostages taken, demands made, a hostage killed and hostages beaten, and rescues thwarted.  Then... the bank is stormed, and everybody comes out... except the robbers.  Where are the guns?  The explosives?  The dead hostage?  The robbers?<br /><br />Perhaps there was an inside man.<br /><br />Great excitement, with nifty twists and turns.  The one curious issue is the role, and character, of Jodie Foster as \\"the discrete problem fixer.\\"  \\"My bite is worse than my bark,\\" she says.  But this character never seems tough, or rough.  It is a mystery why Foster was cast for this character.<br /><br />You are never really sure who is \\"the inside man,\\" or even the robbers.  I might have to see it again, and pay closer attention.  But that's okay, because it is a sponge-worthy film.
0060989157|4.0|I was very surprised that this book was so good. I expected it to be poorly written or self serving but it wasn't. I am not a Motley Crue fan but I love biographies and this one did not disappoint. The guys are very honest even if it doesn't make them look good.  Great read.
B000065VB0|5.0|Every track here deserves its place.  Gabriel flows from individual neurosis to collective identity, turning out cutting critiques of each.  The opening song, &#34;Intruder,&#34; could not be more unsettling with its thundering toms, grating harmonies, and lyric - &#34;Intruder's happy in the dark / Intruder come / Intruder come and he leave his mark.&#34;  It seems fit then to place &#34;Biko&#34; at the end of the album, where electronic production techniques recontextualize African music sources into a haunting tribute to the late anti-apartheid activist.  The production of the album creates a technologically advanced yet primitive world, much like the one in Ridley Scott's &#34;Blade Runner.&#34; I get the feeling that the movie's entire soundtrack was based off the instrumental &#34;Start,&#34; the only sweet spot on this album.  While I can understand criticism of the production as dated, I would argue that its dissonance, distortion, and booming tones are more out of time than anything else. In &#34;I Don't Remember,&#34; the abrasive guitar and elastic bass are never quite where they seem, reinforcing the narrator's confusion and paranoia.  The off-kilter rhythm and eerie synthesizer on &#34;Games Without Frontiers&#34; underpin an alternating militaristic and carefree sentiment.  While it is the most complex work here, I cannot say which is the most memorable.  This is Gabriel's masterpiece.
B00005JPCC|4.0|After the rather inferior Die Another Day, the Bond producers went back to basics, and came back out with a royal flush.  Daniel Craig is a way better Bond actor than Brosnan ever was.  Rougher, tougher, and edgier in every way!  Eva Green is the best \\"good\\" Bond girl I've seen since Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies.  There is real chemistry between her and Craig!  Mads Mikkelson makes for the scariest Bond baddie in recent years.  His torture methods on 007 is even enough to make Auric Goldfinger cringe!  Dynamite action sequences bring back some good old-fashioned stuntwork instead of cheesy visual effects.  My only complaints are a sometimes slow going final third act and I wished they had more of a car chase with the new Aston Martin.  Still, it was fun to see Bond get his first tux, explain the entire recipe of his preferred drink to the casino waiter, and best of all, get his Walther PPK back after a 2 1/2 Bond movie series hiatus.  Bond is back on track!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Let's put it this way.  I drove around Denver for an hour in a trance the first time I listened to this album.  Excellent piece of work...very mellow but an amazing amount of variety.  Highly recommended...just make sure you're sitting down the first time you spin it.
0812975219|5.0|I'm really not sure how anyone could say that the tone of this book is arrogant.  His main theme is that no one is infallible, and that no one should take himself or one's theories too seriously since success may just as likely be due to chance alone.   <br /> <br />The successful usually do not wish to attribute success to randomness, but rather to some virtue such as hard work, perseverence, strength of their philosophies, etc.  This is human nature, and these same successful people become outraged to the implication that the real secret to their success may be mostly due to blind luck.  I suppose the outraged are those unwilling to consider that this might be true.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|Well, listened to the \\"Love\\" album complete in Dolby 5.1 from a friend who bought the double CD/DVD(audio only) & the production & mixing were excellent but the rest of it was just ok\\" for me, nothing special except excellent sound. Personally, i'd rather kiss a toilet seat then endorse this record. I know, i'm hard on the new Beatles releases of late but really, this is exactly what I thought it was which is a soundtrack to the show everyone has been to in Las Vegas. I know because of people who went to this show & told me it is just the CD of it. I do have the card they issued to the show from a friend who went & gave it to me(looks like a credit card). The last release that really impressed the hell out of me was the \\"Anthology\\" sets(even though I had 98% of it in the complete versions of songs included on those disc's way before it was released to the general public who in reality never care for out-takes etc etc). So now i'll have to wait for the remasters & see if they are truly the releases of the band. Other then that I am glad everyone else liked the release. So enjoy & i'll wait for the remasters to be released & maybe, just maybe i'll give a positive review (search our website Judemac Forever on msn)
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This DVD is great for sitting around with friends while discussing the music.A little wine doesn't hurt either.Sound quality is stunning. <br /> <br />Like others have mentioned, I originally had problems getting my dvd player to play this dvd. Using the digital optical link to my amp produced NO sound.After reading about this problem on other forums, I used the 6 analogue wire connections and the external decoder option on my amp (which means using the decoder in my dvd player)and got it to work. Other suggestions I have seen mention setting the dvd player to dvd video out also.  Hope this helps.

0743298020|3.0|Eliciting excellent prose was the mainstay of this novel.  The author crafted superb sentences that flowed into each other, but the plot was not seamless.  A good mystery should tie all the ends together; I felt the events were not woven tight enough to give this a great rating. Both main characters had secrets and Setterfield had no problem revealing their hidden agendas and pasts, but it seemed to take tooooo long.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|First off another reviewer nailed it. Paul and Gene have nothing to do with this release. At best, Tommy Thayer served as a reference to the company that released it. That's about as close to a KISS connection as it gets on this one. This was released by Universal, which now owns Mercury/Polygram (Kiss's old label). They still own some rights to the music they recorded while being under contract to that company. Which brings us to this product and actually the last few Kiss releases, all of which have been \\"best of\\" collections put out by Universal. The only releases of recent times that were completely under Paul and Gene's control were: Kissology Vol. 1, Alive IV symphony, Rock the Nation DVD. Those are all valid products full of unseen footage and unreleased material (unless you're familiar with the bootleg market). So please stop slammin' Gene and Paul so much! yes they are greedy, money hungry, penny pinchers, but at least we get something out of it when it's under their control. <br /> <br /> And as for this CD collection.... I actually enjoy it. Yes, 3 of the 4 discs are just remasters of currently available stuff. But, Alive III was never remastered, and of course the Millennium concert is new. For someone who doesn't have any of Kiss's live stuff, this would be a great set. For someone who has Alive I and II but never bought Alive III (which seems to be the case with some generations of Kiss fans), again this would be a great deal. And everybody, new or old fans, get thier money's worth just because of the Millenium disc. Especially if you get it at the Amazon or Best Buy price. The packaging is awesome (typical Kiss), the sound quality is excellent (I can't tell a difference between this remaster and the ones from a few years ago for Alive I/II, but Alive III definitely sounds better, and the Millennium show is at least a 4 star disc if released by itself), they even got both the original Alive albums onto one disc each. All in all I say this is a solid effort to put out a decent product for once from the Universal company in relation to Kiss.  <br /> <br />I don't really see it necessary at this point to review it from a musical standpoint. Again, 3 of the 4 discs are just remasters of older material, and even the Millenium show is just a showcase of the bands history to that point. The only new songs that the fans haven't heard live before are the ones from Psycho Circus. So if you are even reading this I imagine you are already familiar with the Alive series of albums and my insight into them wouldn't be of much help anyway. Just go buy it.... new or old fan. If you've heard the Alive albums before, just listen again, they only get better with time, especially compared to what gets pumped out of the music biz nowadays. And if you haven't heard them before.... well I'm sorry, genuinely sorry that you haven't heard this piece of music history that way too often gets overlooked or tossed aside because of an image. There's still time to redeem and educate yourself. Go buy this!
B000I5X81A|4.0|Generally this new album sounds a lot like a new J.J. Cale solo-album; though some tracks obviously bear the trade-mark of Eric Clapton's guitar. Cale wrote the majority of the material so this is really no big surprise. Vocally the two sound very much alike; on several tracks they sing in the unison and it seems that Clapton has tried to adapt to the style of Cale.<br /><br />Musically it's Cale crossing over wellknown territory and there are no big surprises to be found on the album. But like on all Cale's albums some tracks do stand out among his mostly blues-riff based songs - on his best albums like \\"Grasshopper\\" many tracks stand out, but that's another story.<br /><br />Here the opening track \\"Danger\\" with its infectious rhythm sets a fine mood from the start. An \\"After Midnight\\" type of song.<br /><br />Though the following tracks all are well performed, they generally sound like something Cale has recorded before. Next track to make an impression is \\"It's So Easy\\" - classic Cale with a great guitar intro.<br /><br />The only ( out of two ) Clapton's songs that stand out is the melodic and acoustic \\"Three Little Girls\\" - sounds a lot like a Cale song. Lyrically the song may be a little too sentimental for some to take; but I like it a lot.<br /><br />A re-recording of the old \\"Don't Cry Sister\\" is another highlight and two fine tracks close the album - especially \\"Who am I Telling You\\" is a song likely to grow on you.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Despite the proliferation of sci-fi movies in the Fab Fifties, the truth is, only a handful of films rose above the genre's b-movie budgets and drive-in mentality.  In an age where giant radioactive monsters attacked, and stalwart scientist/heroes battled alien menaces, Forbidden Planet stands proud as an \\"A\\" picture: A handsomely-mounted interstellar adventure filled with intelligence, wit and wonder.<br /><br />Now's it's the 50th anniversary of this landmark MGM masterpiece, and sci-fi fans (and movie lovers in general) are being rewarded with this deluxe 2-disc release.  You can give that previous \\"bare bones\\" DVD release to a friend, THIS is Forbidden Planet restored to its Cinescope glory, complete with 5.1 sound.  No matter how many times you've seen it (I estimate having seen it myself at least 30 times over the years), you haven't seen the film look this good.<br /><br />\\"Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet\\" is a great documentary, in which we are fortunate to see many surviving cast members.  Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson and others offer their memories of the production.  You'll learn how the \\"id monster\\" was created, and see Bebe Barron discuss the film's \\"electronic tonalities.\\"  There's also a fun featurette on the creation and cultural impact of Robby the Robot.  \\"Watch the Skies,\\" a documentary which originally aired on TCM, offers a survey of fifites science fiction.<br /><br />Now, all that would be enough to satisfy most fans.  But MGM goes the extra mile with MORE features.  Most impressive is the inclusion of the 1957 follow-up film THE INVISIBLE BOY, featuring much of the Forbidden Plaent creative team and, of course, Robby the Robot.  It's an often-overlooked sci-fi/fantasy film about Robby's friendship with a boy (whose father could seriously use a parenting class).  There's also an episode of the 50's t.v. series \\"The Thin Man,\\" featuring Robby, a clip from \\"MGM Parade\\" with Robby and Walter Pidgeon, and a collection of other Warner Bros. sci-fi movie trailers.<br /><br />Certainly, no fan of fifties science fiction can be without this superb set.  But I encourage even those who aren't familiar with Forbidden Planet to add this to your collection.  It's a deluxe presentation of an acknowledged classic, one you're sure to enjoy for years to come.and a collection of other Warner Bros. sci-fi movie trailers. <br /> <br />Certainly, no fan of fifties science fiction can be without this superb set.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Cabin Feaver (Roth's first feature) seemed much more developed than this.  As you will see in many other reviews, this film is uneaven, obviously that was a decided part of the feature, but for the complaints it was obviously not carried out as well as it could have been and i have to agree with that.<br /><br />secondly; the film relies so much on showing the characters as complete party guys that i fealt myself unable to really sympathise with the preppy, rich boys, on their wild party through Europe.<br /><br />third and final; The film looses it's awe when viewed more than two or three times, or if you've just read spoilers or listened to your pals talking about it, then it is pretty much over.  If you know about why it has an R rating (other than the softcore porn int he first half) you know the secret.  it's not particularly well hidden and there isn't anything to be gained by a repeat viewing.<br /><br />overall it IS a very well done film with vivid imagery and an engrossing storyline.  But, i am waiting for Roth to put out some more material before the jury is in on him in my book.
006441034X|4.0|Few authors besides Diana Wynne Jones would venture into the satirical fantasy genre and attempt to make it rich and meaningful.  But Diana Wynne Jones does just that, showcasing not her full brilliance but just enough to make \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" a classic among the light-hearted fantasy genre. <br />    <br />   Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, toiling away in her deceased father's hat shop.  In the land of Ingary, it is considered unwise for the eldest to go off and seek for their fortune, so the timid Sophie is content to stay in her hat shop forever.  All of this changes when the angry Witch of the Waste shows up in Sophie's shop and turns Sophie cruelly into a ninety year old woman!  Sophie than ventures to the moving castle of the dangerous Wizard Howl, hoping he can help her with her spell.  Soon, the old Sophie finds herself tangled up into the affairs of Howl, the Witch of the Waste, a fire demon named Calcifer, and the King of Ingary that all somehow connects to a dangerous contract made between Howl and Calcifer. <br /> <br />   Jones's trademark quirky writing style is evident throughout the story. There are tons of little magical details (such as a door that acts as a portal to four different dimensions) that give the story it's \\"extra spark\\", as Calcifer would say.  Jones's characters are again ingenious. Sophie is timid in the beginning and not until after her aging does her true, somewhat fiesty, self come out.  Howl is charming, immature, loveable, and unbearable all at the same time.  And calicfer is quietly as entertaining as he is mysterious.  However, sometimes the story's plotting is a bit lose, such as the ending, but even a mediocre Jones is still brilliant.  All readers will recognize Jones's message that outward appearences mean nothing, which runs deep throughout the whole book, and it is this brilliance that makes the story something special. <br /> <br /> <br />  \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" at its heart is a satirical fantasy, making fun of all the genre's accepted standards and rules.  But Jones's adept attention to detail, characters, and story makes the book someting much more meaningful.  While not her best work, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is still a highly recommended tale for those readers looking for a witty, romantic, and magical read.   <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is one of the best investments of $17 and 90 minutes of my time, I have made in a long time.  I wish I could have given it 6 or 7 seven stars, to counter some of the obviously thoughtless 1-star reviews.  If Al Gore had appeared this thoughtful and poised in the presidential debates, he would have won the election by an even more comfortable margin - enough to unravel Florida.  And saved us all a lot of wasted time, tax money, international embarrassment, and tears over the last several years. <br />But I am getting political here -- and Mr. Gore did not, in this film -- good for him.  An abundance of facts, and a wonderful presentation.
0307120007|4.0|This is a great book with really fun touch and feel items, but the book is not durable with its flimsy cardboard and its spiral binding.  For the price of this book, I do think it should be more durable.  My son loves to have this book read to him over and over again, but it is wearing out quickly.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I was not disappointed with this new album - perhaps those who were expecting something \\"totally different\\" may be a bit let down. However, I would invite them to listen to the CD a few more times - there is a lot going on in there, and your Western ears may not be catching all the subtleties underlying her considerable talent (and all those who helped her) that is displayed in this album. And of course if it was totally different, then we would be complaining that we missed the old Loreena and wanted her familiar echoes of Celtic melody back again.  <br /> <br />Yes, she does cover some familiar emotional material, but in a new/ancient landscape that includes a much wider tapestry of culture and mixture of foreign musical sources, all included in a subtle mix that does not shout at you \\"Look - I'm here just to make it all sound different.\\"  <br /> <br />Her voice has seasoned and matured but still sends a thrill up the spine, and there are a number of cuts that leave you in awe of the music's grandeur and brilliance that has transported you into a different space. We should all be grateful that she has graced us with such a wonderful musical journey.  <br /> <br />Certainly a number of cuts on this album will form a part of a \\"Best of Loreena\\" album whenever that appears in the future.  <br />
B000ETQPYM|1.0|One has to wonder if Ms. Ahern would have found a publisher for her astonishingly bad novel if she was not the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister. <br />The book shows no talent for writing at all. The plot is derivative. The writing isn't merely awkward. It is downright unreadable. <br />Touted as a best seller, Ms. Ahern should pay restitution to the trees from which the paper was made to print her thoroughly awful book. <br />If there was an option for zero stars I'd use it.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|To me, Heathcliff is one of the most complex and compelling characters ever written and I had once thought that any actor would fall short in playing him in a film or miniseries.  Having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time, I have to say that Ralph Fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti-hero to life.  Emily Bronte would have been proud.  Everyone who has read Wuthering Heights knows about the tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and how he becomes a dark, brooding, manipulative, diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from Cathy, including her daughter and his own child and ward.  Fiennes brings out Heathcliff's many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me.  Juliette Binoche as Cathy Linton/Catherine Earnshaw is great as well.  The supporting cast is quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here!  The backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic, just like Bronte described them in her book.  I am very impressed with this adaptation.  I haven't seen the 1939 film adaptation or the miniseries from Masterpiece Theater yet, but I wonder if they come close to this wonderful film.  The BBC will produce an adaptation some time next year and I think that Richard Armitage (North and South) would make a wonderful Heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting.  In the meantime, I shall treasure this one and watch it over and over again.
B00005JPBP|3.0|Following Nolan's career for sometime now, at least since his brilliant film, Memento, hit the screens as one of the most original stories to come out in years, my expectations were quite high, fuelled by his last project, Batman Begins. Although an interesting script, co-penned with Nolan's brother, John Nolan, (Whose short story inspired the film Memento) lacked in character development and is plot driven to the point that insignificant literary devices are used to justify motivation and therefore comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />Two 19th century magicians begin a deadly rivalry over an undisclosed span of time that becomes all-consuming for each of them. The reason for this rivalry is a revenge for the death of Hugh Jackman's characters wife who dies while performing a dangerous trick. Christian Bale's character mistakenly or not, ties the wrong knot around the woman's wrists, instigating her failure to escape from the water tank, resulting in her death. There is no motivation for the Bale character to intently kill her, as he cannot remember why he knotted the rope in a particular way. This \\"mistake\\" is enough to set the Jackman character on a life time obsession to kill or exact revenge on the other magician. The unintentional knot, to my mind, came across as a weak literary device to ensure the plot drives forward.<br /><br />The cast is certainly impressive from Jackman, Bail and a small part played by David Bowie.<br /><br />Art direction and cinematography in this film are excellent, as a period piece it was realistic down to the smallest detail.<br /><br />All the performances were first rate except for a few scenes that felt to be a little clunky, obviously needing more rehearsal time.<br /><br />Overall the film felt to be rushed, certain scenes unnecessary and others that should not have made the final cut.<br /><br />The ending of the film is surprising though leaned towards the absurd, suddenly turning a thriller into a Science Fiction piece.<br /><br />The Prestige is well worth a look at, one of those films that will appeal to a certain audience, while leaving others wondering what all the hype was about.<br /><br />3.5 stars.iction piece.  <br /> <br />The Prestige is well worth a look at, one of those films that will appeal to a certain audience, while leaving others wondering what all the hype was about.  <br /> <br />3.5 stars.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IOM1RI|4.0|First, see the movie, or you will be lost. Very good soundtrack. This<br />has the best D songs yet. The little acoustic songs, \\" baby,\\" (one of<br />my favorites) \\"Dude\\"( untill the end) and yeah yeah yeah, \\" history.\\" Plus some heavy jams,\\" Master exploder.\\" More up-tempo, \\" break in-city, car chase city.\\" Those two are simply o.k. Then,the un-believably catchy, \\" the government totally sucks,\\" and the two part, \\"Papagenu.\\" Yes most of the songs are very short. So what?? I agree There are a few songs which could have been a little longer, but most of the songs fit as short. The cd's only 33 minutes. The two longest songs, \\" Kickapoo.\\" 4 minutes. And the 6 minute battle between the D and the devil,(Dave Grohl)\\" Beelzeboss.\\" Like the 1st album there's a lot of f-words. Except this time I would guess almost double. For a 2nd album that's 20+ minutes shorter than the 1st album, that's a freaking lot. Enjoyable.
B000784WMW|5.0|If I remember correctly we were made to watch the BBC adaption in 10th grade and I was dreading it but once Dalton stepped onto the scene or should I say galloped onto the screen I was totally lost. I'm glad to see that I am not the only one mesmerized by Dalton's performance in this adaption. For me, this is the ONLY adaption I have enjoyed because Dalton just ruins it for every other actor. After watching the mini-series I bought the book and read it straight through without sleeping. I just love the book and love this version. Yes, it's a bit funny to hear Dalton's Rochester referred to as unattractive but given the magnitude of the performance I can overlook that. The man is stunning in this film and that doesn't hurt but it's the way he delivers his lines that amaze me. I was hanging on every word. This is my favorite book and film of all time. I was highly disappointed... like beyond consolable that the new DVD features a whole hour more than the BBC production yet not ONE new scene of Dalton. That's a tragedy. I'd have died and gone to Heaven if there were some lost scenes of him on the DVD. Ah well.
B000059QYB|5.0|I love this CD.  I have been a fan of Billy's since the early '80s, and this CD encompasses all of his best songs.  It finds its way into my CD player quite often, and I just never seem to tire of it!
0743233832|5.0|This is a great book for bringing into focus the important things in life.  Written almost 2,000 years ago, the information is very valuable and relevant today.<br /><br />While we may know and understand a lot of the information contained in the book, as the authors point out in the introduction, \\"we need more often to be reminded than informed.\\"  The book is not to be read once and placed on the shelf.  It can and should be read from time to time.  It is not necessary to read from front to back or to read the entire book.  You can open the book to any page and find some valuable lessons.<br /><br />A recurring theme of the book is that no one controls your mind but yourself.  But what you allow into your mind controls your outlook on life and your circumstances in life.  Therefore it is imperative that you only think appropriate thoughts.<br /><br />Another very important lessons that is repeated often is \\"for the present moment is of eaual duration for everyone, and that is all any man possess.\\"  That we should not live in the past or the future, but live fully in the present moment.<br /><br />He gives us good advise when we are reminded to remember people, \\"...who ignoring the good that lay at their feet, ran after some vain thing and never found the happiness that was within their reach all the time.\\"<br /><br />There are many excellent lessons on how to lead a better life.  It is well worth reading and contemplating on the lessons contained in the book.<br /><br />It is truly a treasure from the past that still has great value today.
B00005JNJV|5.0|All the press releases to the first Batman by Burton alluded to how different the character would be older, darker, at conflict with continuing role as a crime fighter. What we got was a semblance attempt by Michael Keaton, brow furrowed thru most of the film, to deal with his dual identity which came off shallow and unconvincing and of course being outclassed by Nichcolsons Joker didnt help either.<br /><br />Well finally Christian Bale, working with an excellent script brings us the darkside of Batman and what makes him tick. This movie makes great effort to unfold his story, not rushing thru his metamorphises from Bruce Wayne to the Batman and allows us to follow a delightfull, errr, reimaging of how he got his clothes, weapons and Batmobile and how he had to strive to better what he got to suit his purposes.<br /><br />  Gary Oldman, that wonderfull chameleonish actor now puts on the threads of Jim Gordon, before he became commisioner and he does a fantastic job of  making choices between what Batman might be, just another thug jockeying for position in gotham by eliminating the Falconi mob and what he really is, someone who wants to help.<br /><br />  Michael Caine as Alfred? I wont insult this genius by trying to say  anything, positive though it may be, about a role he was born to play.<br /><br />  Liam Neeson, I didnt feel for his character, I never thought he played the philosopher warrior well anywhere. Neither as Qui Jon the Jedi nor as the man who tries to induct Bruce into the league of shadows.  It all sounds like he was reading directly fromt he script in monotone.
0684803356|5.0|If you read only one, perhaps this should be it.  I am not a trained student of Hemingway, or of literature for that matter.  I know what I like, and I can recognize junk.  You don't have to be an expert or even fully understand the author and his times to appreciate what a superb novel this is.  As I was reading it, I could realize why Hemingway was so honored, even during his lifetime.  The story is basic, though the setting is in unsual one for most American readers (who today probably would guess that the \\"Spanish Civil War\\" has something to do with General Lee and the Alamo).  The main character, Robert Jordan, is an American leftist attached to a guerilla unit in the Spanish mountains.  Like Hemingway, Jordan is intelligent, deliberate, controlled, passionate, and motivated by his ideals.  Through him the reader encounters the chaos of this amateur war that is being played by foreign professionals.  The entire book, which is of some size, revolves around one mission and take places over only a couple of days.  In addition to a political statement and a philosophical autobiography, this is a superb war novel.  The book build up the mission (to destroy a bridge) so much that by the closing pages of the book, as the mission is unfolding, my heart was literally racing and I could not put the book down.  I won't spoil it - but this one ends like so may of EH's books, and like EH thought life itself would end . . . .<br /><br />Great book - don't miss this classic.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I thought King Kong was the best movie of 2005.  Part Raiders of the Lost Ark, Titanic, Jurassic Park and Bambi.  Not to mention the original landmark film.  I was one of those who bought it when it first came out and thus was mad when I saw they were coming out with another one with deleted scenes.  I would have saved my money and waited.  So the question I asked myself was do I want to spend the money and buy a movie I already have.  I read that there might be a scene where they show Kong actually in the boat being taken back to New York.  Something that confuses me to this day.  But, alas, it is not there.  Still there are added scenes with dinosaurs in the jungle and that is worth buying this new edition for.  Fortunatley, they didn't make the first part of the movie before they get to the island any longer.  That was long enough.  But, added jungle scenes with a triceratops and others are fun and you wish they had left them in the original movie.  If you do not have King Kong already buy this one.  If you have it and love it, like me, then you won't be sorry you bought this one too.  For those cynics who are incapable of having fun and didn't like the movie first time then skip this one.
0743298020|5.0|When I was 9, I read A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.  I vividly recall reading it with a flashlight in bed so I could finish the book when it was past \\"lights out\\" hour so my parents wouldn't spy light spilling out from under my door.  As an adult reading THE THIRTEENTH TALE long past my scheduled bedtime, I didn't have to grab a flashlight.  But I did stay awake reading into the wee hours, and I did get up once when the coyotes were howling to peer out the window into the dark...you will understand when you enter the world of the book.
B000I5X80G|3.0|When I first heard that Young was going to start releasing his long-awaited and mythical Archives series, I was very excited. After listening to the first release in this series, Neil Young & Crazy Horse Live at the Fillmore East, I was a little underwhelmed. I can't say anything here is bad. It's great sounding classic live Crazy Horse with material taken from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The problem is, there really isn't enough here. Considering the original performance consisted of a full acoustic set and full electric set, including Cinnamon Girl!, Young really could've shelled out at least an extra 20 minutes from that performance. Realistically, this should've been a 2 disc set and about 2 hours long. Instead we get about a 1/3 of the concert and not even the entire electric set. Weak.

0743289412|1.0|Lisey's Story is the newest in a series of boring books by Stephen King. Very sad considering Mr. King used to be one of my favorite authors. I hate to say this, but it seems since Mr. King got hit by that van, his writing has gone downhill.<br /><br />Liseys's Story got alot of good reviews and I thought maybe the old, page turning Stephen King was back. Not so. I was lucky to get through about 50 pages of this book and called it quits. I was being put to sleep.

0679422714|1.0|Shame, shame, shame! It truely is a shame, albeit interesting, that even one person gave this book a review of more than 1 star. This doesn't bode well for the educational level of the U.S. public I'm afraid. The anti-Maoist, anti-communist, propaganda simply yells out from the first paragraph to the end of the book. Anyone with even a cursory level of education at all would have been skeptical of this book as supposedly being some sort of legit analysis after page 1, paragraph 1. So, I sit here perplexed as to how there could possibly be so many folks who claim to have read the \\"book\\", and who have found something worthy in it. It's actually quite sad. One reviewer, actually more than one, easily recognized this when they noted that this book was directed primarily for those right wingers who already have their minds and agendas made up. Any even semi-objective person, especially scholarly person, would laugh at how poor this book was written. It's actually quite embarrassing to read those who gave this piece of National Enquirer fiction 4 or 5 stars. It's little more than a thick propaganda piece which even Mao would have been embarrassed by. I find it quite ironic that this \\"book\\", which is supposed to be criticizing the communism of Mao, and, of course, communism in all it's forms by association, uses gross propaganda which even the worst forms of communism would probably not even use. Or at least they'd know how to use it in a little better and more sophisticated manner. So, what we have here are the usual two breakdowns. Those who are simply looking for what they believe to be more ammo for their already agenda-laden indoctrinated minds. (And being that the book is thick helps this as it gives the illusion, and that's ALL it is, that there's really something there) And those who are looking at the actual work from a scholarly point of view, and at least attempting NOT to let their preconceived notions jade the ability to be somewhat objective. I would guess that most Chinese scholars, or scholars of Chinese history and politics, probably use this book as a thick coaster or tire wedge. There ARE a few scholars who have left reviews here which I urge those who are at least making an attempt to learn something to check out. And, as another reviewer said, who I believe teaches as well, they will use this book as an example of how NOT to write a history. Note also the number of Chinese reviewers who are critical. I guess they've just been too indoctrinated by communist propaganda, so much so that they do not understand what Chang has managed to somehow understand. There are many other books, REAL books, on China for those who wish to learn something. Many have been named by other reviewers so I won't repeat them here. If there were minus stars, this would receive about a minus 4. The reason that it's not a minus five is because most of the spelling was correct.kb

B000GTLQXU|3.0|Whereas The Poseidon Adventure (the 1972 original classic) focused on the characters trying to survive the upside-down-ship-sinking disaster, this incredibly unnecessary remake merely uses its characters for a good excuse to put a lot of cool special effects together and call it a film.  To play these characters, the filmmakers assembled some of my least favorite actors in the world (e.g., Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell).  Fortunately, though, the cast includes the angelic Emmy Rossum, who looks extremely good wet, I must say (especially from certain camera angles).  Josh Lucas is actually quite good in his role, although his sudden transformation from a guy who cares only about saving himself to full-fledged, selfless hero is problematic, and I guess you're supposed to pull for the kid to survive, but none of these characters really matter all that much.  You would think this kind of life-threatening ordeal would endear the characters to us, but that just doesn't happen.  Why develop characters when you can just keep blowing things up?  That seems to be the filmmakers' philosophy here.<br /><br />You already know the story.  A rogue wave comes up and knocks the cruise liner Poseidon all the way over, leaving a small group of characters to defy the captain's ill-advised instructions and head upward to try and find a way out through the bottom of the ship.  They face all kinds of deadly obstacles on their way, from rising water (duh) to live wires to flash fires and explosions, etc.  Some make it, some don't, but it's not like you actually care about any of them.  The only thing resembling a subplot involves Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and Jennifer's young suitor (Mike Vogel), who hasn't really gained the old man's trust as of yet.  Dreyfuss' character is gay for no apparent reason, and we learn next to nothing about the other main characters.  Basically, this film has the kind of script that could easily have been written on a napkin during some writer's lunch meeting with the director.<br /><br />The CGI-laded special effects are pretty good (albeit excessive), but it's just a mistake to build a film around the special effects.  I certainly appreciate the filmmakers going to so much trouble to make the climactic first few minutes of the capsizing surprisingly graphic and as real as possible, but it would have served the film well to devote some of that same passion to the weak script.  As it is, the film - like the ship itself - sinks more and more with each passing minute.uring some writer's lunch meeting with the director.

B00005JPCY|5.0|Deja Vu.  I went to this movie with some friends of mine with LOW expectations(I wanted to see The Fountain, but thats a long story).  I was expecting a big, dumb action thriller with some time travel garbage thrown in.  Don't get me wrong, I think Denzel Washington is a great actor, Adam Goldberg is also great, but the trailers made it seem(at least to me) like a big action movie.  Bruckheimer's name didn't help.  Surprisingly it was fresh, smart, funny, and exciting. <br /> <br />Tony Scott, what can I say.  I feel bad for him, but I'm gonna have to stop if he keeps directing good movies like this.  Would that not suck to have Ridley Scott as a brother.  I can think of Thanksgiving.  <br />*Scott's mom* \\"Dear Lord, thank you for Ridley's amazing directorial abilities and gifts.  And thank you for Tony's um, action films.\\" <br />Sorry, off track.  I thought Scott's editing and cuts were great, I was really surprised at how good a job he did. <br /> <br />The acting is great, what else would you expect from Denzel?  It wasn't Oscar worthy, but it was a great performance and with anyone else it probably would have not have been as good of a story. <br /> <br />The story.  Its a bit confusing, but not confusing enough to be scratching your head over.  Basically, there is a government program that can look 4 and a half days into the past(theres more to it than that, but its too hard to explain).  Denzel falls in love with a lady(Paula Patton) who is a victim in a ferry explosion.  There are some fabulous scenes, such as the Ferry, the car chase, and the room with the computer. <br /> <br />Overall this movie has a little bit of everything: Humor, action, suspense, great CG, and a bit of a love story thrown in.  Go see this movie, I was surprised at how well it worked and this is the type of movie anyone can enjoy.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Like so many others I was wondering if Loreena would ever make music again, and was eager to accept whatever came along if she decided to. Well, An Ancient Muse goes way beyond my expectations. As others have said, it builds upon her past work and thus is familiar, but the power of the music has reached a new level. We've had the CD for less than a week and it has already become the most played item in our collection. Worth the wait? No - the wait was way too long. I'm already eagerly awaiting what comes next.

0062502182|1.0|So many people had recomended this book to me over the past few years that I thought I should read it myself to see why they loved it so much and how it changed their lives.  The book did NOT live up to any of my expectations.<br /><br />It bases absurdly unlikely plot twists on precepts of animism (everything has a spirit with which you can talk adn even trick into doing what you want) and superstitious nonsense that it tries to color with philosophic jargon.  Page after agonizing page of trite platitudes does not make a fable, nor does it make a readable text.<br /><br />The book is boring, but what makes it unreadable is the sillyness of most of what goes on.  The universe conspires to help you follow your dream if it is your One True Dream? Oh, but you just had this dream twice, so the universe will send you various magical beings to guide your quest.  The universe protects drunks, children and the elderly from harm?<br /><br />The characters do not seem real or the least bit believable.  The descriptive language is flat.  There is never a sense of danger or anticipation.  The plot is simple and predictable enough that once you get about helfway, you could write the same ending yourself (and probably do a better job).<br /><br />Basically, don't bother.  It is bad enough that I now have a lower opinion of the people who told me that they loved it and that it changed their lives forever.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I love this album, but I also have loved each Beatles album in the original \\"uncut\\" versions prior to this one.  The show is full of Beatles-themed theatrics which brings the music to life, however listening to the album by itself I can see how one who has never heard the original versions of the songs may be mislead by the artists intent.  I think that this album may be enjoyed by anoyone, but if I was the artist I would want the listener to hear the originals first to gain more perspective.  That said, this album IS for Beatles fans.  It's a great album, I L-O-V-E the remastered songs, they sound amazing.
B000GFRJ58|5.0|When Ronnie Lane was having financial difficulty he asked Pete Townshend for a loan. Pete said no. He then suggested that Pete produce his solo album and contribute songs to a solo album Townshend had a counter proposal; they record an album together. The result is the marvelous \\"Rough Mix\\" which features both songwriters in top form and meshing to create a unique sythesizer of both their sounds. The album sounds like a collison of these two unique songwriters and their bands (Lane was a member at one time of the Faces and The Small Faces)than just about anything either one of them created by themselves. The production by Glyn Johns and musical contributions from John Entwhistle, Eric Clapton, Charlie Watts and Rabbit makes this marvelous musical confection come together and gel.<br /><br />Does this album sound better than the previously mastered version? Yeah it's improved but only for the 5.1 mix. The Redbook layer (which sometimes doesn't play in CD players) is brighter, louder and more compressed. We get the original album remastered for CD with video interviews with producer Johns and Townshend on the DVD-audio side of things. There are also stills from Townshend's collection of the recording of the album. The 5.1 mix of the album sounds quite good as well although I find myself listening a bit more to the stereo CD side only because I tend to listen to music much more in the car than I do at home.<br /><br />The booklet has information on the recording of the album in a brief essay as well as the original lyrics for all the songs. The big find though is three previously unreleased songs two by Lane and one by Townshend. \\"Good Question\\" builds on a demo from \\"Scoop\\" that Townshend recorded called \\"Brrr\\". Both \\"Only You\\" and \\"Silly Little Man\\" are exceptional Lane tunes that add to his musical legacy.<br /><br />A warning to Townshend/Who fans; don't except \\"Empty Glass\\" this album has much more in common in tone, feel and sound to Townshend's \\"Who Came First\\" album than his later albums.<br /><br />Pete's in great voice throughout. Townshend's songs tend to rock out a bit more than Lane's but the two provide perfect balance to each other here. My advice--if you're going to listen to the Redbook CD layer a lot stick with your original CD.album than his later albums.<br /><br />Pete's in great voice throughout.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Set in a futuristic Britain, the story opens about about the story of Guy Fawkes and his legend. Being an American, I had no clue who Guy Fawkes was or is and if the legend was fabricated or if it really did happen.<br /><br />The movie proceeds with introducing you to Evey (Natalie Portman) and in the background you can hear tirade from the \\"Voice of London\\" is loud and booming. while Evey looks into a mirror and applies her makeup.<br /><br />I was hooked on this first scene because the \\"Voice\\" was damning and condemning in all it's viciousness. It makes you think of the facists that are currently beating their bibles over everyones' heads. I enjoyed the entire movie, including Hugo Weaving's (\\"V\\") eloquent speeches and vernacular. I felt Hugo Weaving really was the star and made the \\"V\\" character come to life in such a vivid form.<br /><br />Here is my favorite quote:<br /><br />\\"Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.\\"<br /><br />As much as I love this movie, there was one scene that really didn't belong. Throughout the whole movie, it was philosophical and chilling.<br /><br />There was a \\"knife and dagger\\" scene (towards the end) that just didn't belong. It belonged more in a horror or action-only film where that sort of thing is expected. But when you have a vengeful hero that has an eloquent dialect, then all of a sudden he turns into a throat slicing, body sawing, (you get the point) You really just want to fast forward through that part. Really, we all see action movies where there is NO plot and the main objective is cool bloody graphics and scenes. This wasn't the movie for it. It was tacky and distasteful.<br /><br />That was the only scene, in my opinion, that felt out of place and out of step with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to people who liked 1984 and other similar stories.slicing, body sawing, (you get the point) You really just want to fast forward through that part.

0393051587|3.0|I have been reading \\"A Christmas Carol\\" almost every year at Christmas since my teens.  My original copy was just about dead, and then I saw this.  I already own the \\"Annotated Alice in Wonderland\\" and think it is wonderful, so I had high hopes for this book.<br /><br />The annotations are great for literary stuff - influences on Dickens, prior work that is similar, the history of Christmas books, etc.  The illustrations are also wonderful, not merely the original ones but also contemporary pictures of life in London as well as some other famous early illustrations of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", notably Gustave Dore.<br /><br />It is much less informative when it comes to vocabulary.  For example, in the first stave there is a description of Bob Cratchit going down a 'slide' on Cornhill.  I have always known that this was unlikely to have been today's  playground slide, but I didn't know what it was.  There is no annotation to this question, but my question has been at least partially answered by an accompanying illustration which shows a plank of wood which has been coated with ice.  In the same paragraph there is no explanation of the word comforter - not a filled quilted blanket, as today in America, but a long knitted scarf.<br /><br />Overall, I have to give this an average rating, mainly because if you are going to do an annotation, you had better do it completely.  This is especially true in this case where the author has had almost 20 years to fix things.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|I couldn't bring myself to like this movie. While the acting was pretty good, the directing IMO was overambitious and the script  atrocious - full of holes, unconnected story lines and just plain static. While some people might call this art, to me it looks more like incompetence. In any case, the film is a project no one could salvage from well-deserved obscurity.<br /><br />The plot line is cliche-y, good ol' conspiracy genre mixing corrupt Saudis, ruthless corporate executives and cabals formed by US Judiciary, State, CIA, large law firms and large corporations...  working together to derail a well-meaning pretender to the 'Saudi' throne... throw in the Hezbollah, naive Pakistanis brainwashed into terrorists, expat financial advisors (Matt Damon) working to help the renegade prince and a seasoned CIA Mid-East operative (Clooney) made into a scapegoat after a botched assassination, and you get a collage of same-looking faces, roles, scenes and story lines that is all but undecipherable.<br /><br />There is a sort of coming together at the end, but it is a whimper rather than a finale, nothing gets resolved and it all falls flat. For heaven's sake, we all know that most everyone associated with the oil business is corrupt, its part of the business model. We know there is a rat race out there, and that the world is dog-eat-dog. Yet reason many of us watch films is because we want to see good craftmanship, vision and inspiration, not to find our political opinions confirmed. I'd say this film fails miserably in making the viewer care about its characters, about the Middle East, its realities and its problems.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|hostel is terrifying. this is one of LG's better films by far. i have to admit i was scared through the movie for a couple of different reasons.  <br /> <br />1)the gore/torture scenes aren't THAT graphic, but they do justice for horror's sake. just to imagine the pain is enough to freak you out. <br /> <br />2)the plot is very strong and makes the movie even scarier, just to think, this could actually happen. <br /> <br />these two things teamed up together to make this a new generation horror movie. acting was great. lionsgate outdone themselves with their 2006 release of hostel. i can definently say i was impressed.  <br /> <br />the only con about the movie is i wish it was longer. it's only about 90 minutes long. overall, fantastic, thrilling. 4 stars. a must see.

B00000DLV1|4.0|I remember listening to this album when it first came out, and it's aged pretty well, but for the turn-table bits. Those are an acquired taste. Overall, the Roseland recording improves on almost every song in their catalog -- an exceedingly rare feat for any band. The best you can usually expect is a clean recording, but Portishead goes much further by \\"re-imagining\\" each song with orchestral backing. And the results are such that you might find yourself mesmerized by songs that never did much for you before. And they don't screw up the songs that were already good, except perhaps for \\"Sour Times.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most beautiful song, \\"Roads,\\" is marred by an enthusiastic audience clap-along. All throughout the album, you'll note that the audience is a surprisingly muted presence for a live album (muted in the mix phase, not in the raw audio, it sounds like). But they come out in cheerful force... to the aid of the most haunting and lonesome Portishead song I've ever heard. The incongruity doesn't recede with repeated listens, either. At least the band manages to drown these yahoos out during the peaks.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if they had the audience on separate mikes and could release a version that doesn't include that part. Wishful thinking, though. If there was a chance that Portishead was still around and putting out more stuff, it wouldn't irk me so much. But this is all we got  -- three albums, one of which is this live \\"greatest hits\\" recording. In other words, not much. (I don't count Glory Times because it's a remix album, and barely one at that.)
B0002UOK04|5.0|i picked this up one day after after listening to a clip of one of the songs figuring i'd give it a try since i had heard it is similar to Children of Bodom or Kalmah and such. I think i listened to it 4 times through in a row it was so good. This piece of metal is just great, its got a nice melodic/viking/folk whatnot sound to it thats not quite like anything i've heard before. i would recomend this to anyone who likes good metal.
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is one of those books rarely encountered: massive in scope and detail, yet effortless in the reading.<br /><br />Guised as fiction, the book is essentially an autobiography.  Having escaped from an Australian prison, our hero Lin arrives in India with little more than his forged passport and a fierce desire to live. He immediately meets an enterprising tour guide, Prabaker, who serves as both logistical and philosophical mentor through the complexities of a culture that is totally unknown to Lin.<br /><br />At first I was worried this would be some sort of \\"Bwana in the Jungle City\\" sort of book, and my guard was up.  And I suppose I should defer to friends in Mumbai for the ultimate adjudication of that concern, however to my somewhat sheltered eyes no such cultural bias or snubbery emerged. Lin travels to the country village of Prabaker's family, learns the Marathi language, and generally adapts his behavior to that of the local mores. After months spent acculturating in the small town, Lin returns to the city, and establishes residence in a sprawling slum, setting up a free health clinic and making full use of the black market and other underground economies for his own survival and that of his clinic.  And this is just the beginning.<br /><br />Lin is captured and thrown in the worst of prisons, where he is tortured and beaten almost to death. Upon his final release he works as a smuggler, passport forger, and guerilla in the Afghani war against Russia.  In spite of his criminal activity Lin maintains higher ethics than many so-called upright people, and continues to care for the poor of Bombay through his health clinic and other tangible supports. His love of Karla, a mysterious Swiss American, is complicated, deep, and transcendent.  This is a fascinating work and leads to many wonderful discussions of the nature of moral behavior and the role of motivation and means.<br /><br />I read criticism that this is too narrow a view of present-day urban India, and depicts exclusively an underbelly of crime and corruption. But this is not a travelogue. It is the story of one man and his experience. It so happens his experience was pretty much confined to the seamier side of town. One need only visit the author's website to see that he has taken his experience and spun from it a network of good works; projects which serve his beloved adopted nation on several levels.<br /><br />Like War and Peace, and other large works, Shantaram deserves several readings in a lifetime for full appreciation. The prose is beautiful, at times embarrassingly florid, and yet always spot on real. This is as much a book of philosophy as of biography.  Even more remarkable, this is a first novel.  One can only sit back and breathlessly await more from author Gregory Roberts.<br /><br />And we don't have to wait too long.

B00005K9LN|5.0|British Steel was my first Judas Priest album, which I bought on casette back in junior high.  Thinking back now, I can't remember what turned me onto it.  Maybe it was the \\"Breaking the Law\\" music video I saw on Beavis and Butthead, but it's not important now.  I listen to everything from Marilyn Manson to Cannibal Corpse and British Steel is still one of my top ten favorite metal albums.<br /><br />It's not bone-crushing heavy, no.  It's not that kind of music.  I wouldn't call it \\"pop metal\\" but it's not lyrically deep or technically complicated.  I would relate it most closely to ACDC's Back in Black.  It's just real catchy, fun, and good.<br /><br />It's more than just good melodies.  There's a certain punch to it, and I think it's in the delivery.  The mid-tempo song like Grinder and Metal Gods get a real good groove going and then just keep it up.  It's something about Rob singing those short staccato syllables over the beat.  Some of the tracks like Living After Midnight and Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise have more of a rock 'n' roll feel to them rather than what I think of as metal, but still rock none the less.  And of course Rapid Fire is here as the obligatory fast tempo priest screamer with the banshee wail at the end.  The Rage, while it does seem out of place on this album (as another reviewer pointed out) with its moody, brooding, sludgey feel and decidedly darker lyrics, becomes one of the album's best tracks with repeated listens.  This song always gave me the most colorful mental imagery, though admittedly partly because of misheard lyrics (like early Ozzy, I find rob's voice sometimes garbles itself).<br /><br />There's not one mediocre track on the record.  The big picture is that British Steel is a very solid and fairly diverse collection of classic metal that's best heard while shouting along in one's car on the highway.<br /><br />Now, a few notes about this reissue:<br /><br />I can't speak for the difference in audio quality, since everything sounds bad on casette, but I will review the extras.  The bonus track Red, White & Blue is a mediocre outtake that sound WAY out of place on the record, and in my opinion, tarnishes the album.  It's not terrible, but it just doesn't fit.  Another reviewer cites it as being a leftover from the ill-recieved Turbo album priest recorded several albums later.  If this is the case, why is it here instead of on the Turbo remaster?  The live version of Grinder, however, while hardly necessary, is well performed and, in my opinion, a keeper.  On a sidenote, I can't help but wonder why the track order was changed from the original release.  My old casette version had Breaking The Law as track 1.  I'm getting used to hearing it this way, but I can't help but wonder which way the band intended it to be.rything sounds bad on casette, but I will review the extras.

0066620996|5.0|When I selected 'Good to Great' to take along on my summer vacation, I had no idea that what I was about to read would shift my perspective on leadership, employee motivation, product diversification as well as organizational transformation. Excellent work! Mr. Collins and his team did the legwork (and provide the supporting statistics) to unearth variables and characteristics of companies that have, despite challenges, successfully navigated change.   <br /> <br />The book is well-written, and the material is delivered in an organized, readable format. Collins interlaces facts, cases histories, interview comments along with some basic prinicples of organizational development to present a compelling case for analysis and organizational self-reflection.   <br /> <br />I don't think a week has gone by since August that I haven't somehow revisited at least one of the concepts Collins presents in 'Good to Great'. In pursuit of my Master's Degree in Management I have read numerous books during the past two years and for me, this one definitely stands out.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|For a band where all 4 members played their last collective note decades ago, the Beatles' \\"Love\\" is a pure masterpiece. It belongs right up there with Sgt. Pepper as a work of exploratory genius. While no track is held as sacred in the mix, every note is a diamond. Love is a beautiful hallucination that you will remember and cherish.<br /><br />The Beatles were known for experimenting with sound. Some of the modern day effects processors such as the \\"flanger\\" used today were invented specifically for a Beatles record.  Whether it was a string section or a sitar player flown in from halfway around the world, the Beatles had every thing they asked for to make great music.  It was George Martin who brought it all together and made it work.<br /><br />Years after their break up, their recorded work began to be weighed down with nostalgia, marketers stripping their legacy for spare parts, gutting their vital work for greatest hits CD's and sneaker commercials.<br /><br />George Martin was reduced to spend his remaining years rehashing the same stories over and over for countless books and dvds like a forgotten museum curator or a bored librarian.<br /><br />Love changes all of that.<br /><br />George and Giles Martin break into the Beatles museum, perform a musical s&eacute;ance and resurrect a rock band to change the music world one last time. They open the cage doors wide and let the songs run wild, thawing every note that's been frozen in our minds. The Martins turn our old Beatles upside down and set them (and us) free in the process.<br /><br />Nothing is where it \\"should\\" be; shooting us through the rabbit hole before we have a chance to change our minds.<br /><br />Welcome to the Beatles' Fun House.<br /><br />Just when there's a lull, mischievous Beatles leap from behind corners to scream \\"Help\\". Relax too much, and John Lennon jumps out screaming to start Revolution. Unpredictable, reckless, dangerous- how's that for a Beatles record?<br /><br />Martin keeps you off balance the way a great record should. You're not falling asleep to this record. One minute later, the floor will drop. There's no sentimental fluff here.<br /><br />Don't skip tracks. Listen to it in one setting. Don't bother previewing snippets. It's a waste of time. Telling you what happens in all 26 songs is like spoiling the cliffhanger of a movie. Every song has a purpose to the CD. There is perfect pacing.<br /><br />Have you heard rare Beatles tracks before? Memorized all the Mark Lewisohn studio diaries that tracked every recording they made? Then little new material will surprise you. But you will hear the Beatles in a way you never have.<br /><br />To call it a \\"mash up\\" is to cheapen it. Mash ups usually include more than one band and from different genres.<br /><br />It's not a remix. It's a reconstruction from the person who helped build it in the first place.<br /><br />The sound quality is ridiculously good. Every note sounds new. This is a living and breathing CD. It's not a greatest hits; but you will be sorry when it's over.<br /><br />We are meeting the Beatles in a new way. George Harrison sounds beautiful in a way I might not have known. John Lennon's voice is a revelation. Paul McCartney's bass is perfect. Ringo Starr's drums sound incredible.<br /><br />Every sound you hear is a high point flashing by in seconds.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br /><br />John Lennon shares parts of Tomorrow Never Knows with George Harrison's Within You Without You.<br /><br />The Martins mix the hard edge of I Want You with Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.<br /><br />George Martin may have lost some of his hearing but that didn't stop him from writing a nice string section for George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps.<br /><br />Gnik Nus (sun king played backward) is a gorgeous acapella vocal that segues perfectly into Something.  You can play the Beatles backward, forward or all at once and it will still be beautiful.<br /><br />Stare at your watch and you'll miss it. In fact, you'll want to listen to it many times to capture all the treasures on this CD.<br /><br />Some of the best parts of the CD are the drop dead gorgeous intros. But you have to hear the ending of the previous song to appreciate it.  So if you skip tracks you'll never hear them.  Hidden in the ending of Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows, the intro to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is slowed down to a dramatic ambient crawl, the kick drum echoes like a heartbeat before the song is sped up to normal like a music box and the Beatles come to life again.<br /><br />Here Comes the Sun is rethought to begin with vocal harmonies at the beginning over a raga beat, and as the guitar begins playing the melody we remember, a sitar plays on the right channel to heartbreakingly beautiful effect.<br /><br />When you hear the drums stop in the middle of Hey Jude and just hear their voices, you will be blown away.  As Hey Jude fades, the horns keep playing.  It is right at home as Sgt. Pepper reprise begins. You have 2 endings at the same time. One for an incredible song (Hey Jude) and one for a landmark album (Sgt Pepper).<br /><br />The album ends with John and the Beatles in a playful mood, saying good night.<br /><br />This isn't some producer who the Beatles never met hacking away at their legacy. George Martin looked John Lennon in the eye when he recorded almost every song as a Beatle. He wrote the string arrangement for Paul McCartney's Eleanor Rigby. Without George Martin, Sgt Pepper's orchestral arrangements might just be a wish. He is considered the \\"fifth Beatle\\" for a reason. This wasn't made in some back room against the wishes of the Beatles.<br /><br />George Harrison had become good friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Lalibert&eacute; and wanted this project to happen. Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and George Harrison's wife Olivia all heard mixes and gave feedback, suggestions and  encouragement.<br /><br />To be fair, without C D S, this CD would not have happened. The good news is it is great on its own merit. You don't need the show to appreciate it.<br /><br />Credit should also be given to Giles Martin, who obviously helped the project a great deal. He was also trained by the one person who the Beatles trusted with their music: his father.<br /><br />This may be the last Beatles project George Martin works on.<br /><br />As the master tapes are put back in their boxes and the vault door closes, George Martin can rest knowing he made something very special with \\"Love\\", if only for one last time.  Thank you, George Martin.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. -EveningOcean CD \\"The Attraction\\" Evening Ocean com<br />[[ASIN:B000GL196M THE ATTRACTION]]ntros.

078401213X|4.0|Pi is one of those movies that wonderfully speaks to the psuedo-intellectual in all of us, and gives us comfort in the idea that somehow we might actually be able to gain understanding of this mess around us.<br /><br />Now, don't take that as a insult, the films by this director(I can't spell his last name off the top of my head right now, sorry) are quite fun and enjoyable.  Actually, i'm sure quite sure why i'm writing this now, as I'm not sure i know anyone who hasn't seen this movie, and who doesn't suddenly turn into a religious scholar and mathamatican upon discussing it.  I'm not going to discuss the plotline, i'm sure you've already read the main review.<br /><br />But I will say that the movie is very entertaining and well put together.  Not everyone seems to like the black and white, but I think it gives this film character.  The movie is fairly creative with its characters and set up, and the story itself is interesting and keep enough pace to not lose the average movie goers attention.<br /><br />So in short, see it.
B00005JNX0|3.0|I moderately enjoyed this but am starting to be bothered by the tendency of animators to be content with creating films that 1) have no real story and 2) are built around whatever animal characters haven't previously been used in other films.  Though other films have had lions, few or none have featured zebras, hippos, and giraffes.  I can imagine the early concept planning sessions:  \\"How about a gerbil?  Has anyone used them before?\\"  I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that they create the characters for these things first and then construct a story around them.  And that is the problem with this film:  they don't start by creating a great and compelling story.  Contrast this animated film with either of the SHREK films or THE INCREDIBLES.  The latter films have great stories.  Or going farther afield, contrast MADAGASCAR with any of the film by Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  Miyazaki's films are not merely brilliantly animated; they feature magnificent stories.<br /><br />Despite not really having a story, the film is otherwise executed with the kind of panache and sheen that has become standard in the CGI-film.  The characters all look fascinating and are wonderful to look at.  Alex's mane, to cite only one example, with its hundreds of individually articulated strands of fur is stunning.  There isn't a frame in the film that isn't wonderful to gaze at.  And the voice over work and the individual jokes are marvelous to behold.  There just isn't a whole lot of story and what story there is arises from Alex's need to eat.<br /><br />My worry with the contemporary Hollywood animated film, whether CGI or hand drawn (though virtually none seem to be hand drawn these days) is that increasingly story is being neglected for the design of the look of the characters, a long string of in jokes, and the background art.  SHREK had all of these elements as well, but also featured a strong story.  So, a truly intelligent animated film clearly is still possible.  MADAGASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.  I would gladly have given up a few of the jokes for even a halfway decent story.ASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.

B00001ZWTT|1.0|When I was in middle school I believe and this movie was a hit, it was one of those things that breaks one's belief and hope in the species they are a part of.  Why this movie, or the music from it proved a hit is nothing more than a testament to the idea that the earth might be better off being ran by cockroaches.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I bought this album mainly on the strength of the one song Wintersong which I just love. Her voice reminds me of a Angel sent to earth to spread her kindness and mercy to all. <br /> <br />The other notable song is the cover of River, which sounds even better on the version with just her and the piano on the Amazon streaming video. O Little town of Bethlehem also sounds better with her and a real guitar in the video. On the album she plays a Dobro which sounds odd. <br /> <br />Silent night I felt was a bit too fast and War is over sounds too happy for my liking.
B000002ADT|5.0|One time I was telling my friend who is also very into music about how upon becoming an angsty teenager one should be assigned a certain group of records straightaway.<br /><br />I think that \\"Kind of Blue\\" on the other hand should be assigned to the average college student upon enrollment.<br /><br />I will say in all honesty that I really didn't know anything about jazz before this record.  I still don't really know much about jazz(but this record makes me want to, and it has me asking questions to those that do).  Its just one of those pieces you can spin that will appeal to anyone with ears and the slightest bit of taste(the latter part is becoming increasely scarce these days).  Its one of the most mood setting albums I know, and its a mood that I want to be in.  Just sit back, relax and embrace the album's sleekness and warmth.

This one is just two, not that great.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is turning into quite the filmmaker. Already his first two films, Amores perros and 21 Grams (which I thought was the best film of 2003) were hugh international successes, which brought much praise Inarritu's way. His new film \\"Babel\\" is equally deserving of such praise. It is one of the year's best films.<br /><br /> As was the case with his previous films \\"Babel\\" is an interlocking character film, where we get to meet many different characters, each involved in a different storyline, which very carefully starts to intertwine all the characters together.<br /><br /> Given that the film's title is \\"Babel\\" the movie becomes a religious epic. It is a story of love, tolerance and forgiveness. But it never preaches to its audience. The film makes us believe in these people. They are more than merely pawns who help move the plot forward. Every character gained my interest. I was genuinely interested in what would happen to them.<br /><br /> Inarritu is proving himself to be one of the most gifted directors working today. He expresses the human condition in a lyrical and poetic way that hasn't been done since Ingmar Bergman.<br /><br /> Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star as Richard and Susan an American couple visiting Morocco. Susan gets into an accident. While travelling on a tour bus, she is hit by a bullet. A terrorist attack is the immediate response. But things aren't that black & white. Richard must now do everything he can to save his wife.<br /><br /> Adriana Barraza plays Amelia, an illegal alien who has been watching an American couple's children. She has requested the day off so she can attend her son's wedding in Mexico, but, on the day of the wedding finds that she is not longer able to have the day off as the children's parents are unable to come home.<br /><br /> Amelia now decides to bring the children with her as her nephew, Gael Garcia Bernal, drives them into Mexico.<br /><br /> Zohra (Wahiba Sahmi) and Yasira (Fadmael Ouali) are children who must attend their father's sheep. The father has recently bought a rifle in order for his kids to kill wolves which attack the sheep. Soon the young boys get in trouble when a \\"game\\" goes terribly wrong.<br /><br /> Finally there is Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) a deaf-mute, who's mother died and has left her with her father. The two aren't on best terms leading Chieko to feel like an outsider and seek love and acceptance, sadly in all the wrong ways and with all the wrong people.<br /><br /> How any of these stories connect I will leave up to you to go and see the movie but the connection are done in a masterful way. Inarritu slow builds the suspense in the scenes just enough to get our attention and then changes course going to another story.<br /><br /> That technique may bother some, but, what it does is brings us closer to the story. He become more and more involved in these characters and their situations.<br /><br /> It's hard to say who gives the best performance in the film. There isn't one character who stands out more than another. Everyone is equally effective. This is a true ensemble piece. It would however be a shame if \\"Babel\\" didn't recieve Oscar nominations for \\"Best Picture\\", \\"Director\\" and \\"Screenplay\\".<br /><br /> Inarritu and company weave a story that will touch many people's hearts and challenge their minds. In the end, what more could we possible ask for.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of the year's best films.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is one of those Indie films that people will either love or hate - there is very little middle ground. Maybe that's one reason why it usually works - it never falls victimn to Political Correctness or outrage - it cruises along almost like a documentary. The four addicts played by Ellen Burstyn (diet pills), Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans (heroin) are like failures from the show \\"Intervention.\\" Leto, who would wreck his career with \\"Alexander\\" a couple years later, is quite good and Connelly, who nearly stole \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" from Russell Crowe is hauntingly effective and real. Ms. Burstyn is a marvel: her sad,lonely Brighton Beach widow left with nothing but a dream of game-show stardom is an amazing performance. Her Oscar nomination was richly deserved - she has received Oscar nods in 4 different decades - a feat that only Bette Davis and Meryl Streep have also achieved. But \\"Requiem\\" is a jarring and often ugly film that dectracts from its allure. This film is a serious downer - don't watch if you are having a rough day
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|The movie: For my tastes, there were too many long sequences of preachy dialogue - I found myself squirming in my seat waiting for the movie to get back on track.  However, friends didn't have this as an immediate reaction, but agreed after I mentioned it.<br /><br />The underlying story: (1) Guy Fawkes is an unlikely hero.  The Gunpowder Plot was to replace a religiously tolerant government (for its time) - the laws on religious conformity were largely unenforced (a version of \\"Don't ask; don't tell\\") - with a Catholic state that included the Inquistion.  Guy Fawkes had more in common with the autocratic government of this story than with the resistance.  (2) The victory against the dictator had been won before the Parliament building was destroyed, and that victory came from the leader being parodied and mocked on TV.  V's destruction of the Parliament building was an act of anarchism - destruction of institutions simply because they are institutions.  Realistically, you don't destroy institutions with long solid records because they have been briefly subverted.  OK, so I think more about these things than the average movie goer!
B00005JPAM|4.0|Director Stephen Frears using reels of archival footage created an insightful pseudo documentary surrounding the drama played out around the British royal family in the wake of the tragic death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />Helen Mirren was at her frumpy and matronly best portraying Queen Elizabeth trapped in the quagmire of tradition in attempting to respond to Diana's demise.  The royals were represented as a privileged and aloof lot severely misjudging the outpouring of emotion of the British people indicative of their affection for the beloved princess.  This was shown most clearly through the heartless response of Prince Philip played by veteran actor James Cromwell.<br /><br />While Prince Charles was played sympathetically by Alex Jennings, the real savior of the Brits was newly elected prime minister Tony Blair played superbly by Michael Sheen.  Blair while wafting through the proper etiquette in dealing with the queen, accurately judged the emotion of the British populace.  The Queen's lack of a public response to the tragedy was eroding her support throughout the country.  New kid on the block Blair advised the Queen to show some unrestricted emotion and compassion, which she ultimately did.<br /><br />The movie featured a myriad of excellent acting performances yet tended to drag as this unforgetable calamity and drama played out before the unobscured view of the television cameras.
B00005ATQD|2.0|First of all, pot doesn't make you aggressive. It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.     Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.    Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying \\"I'm a doctor\\", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)    The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed? Was there really foul play involved in death of the junkie prostitute and the quick exit of the piano player? What the hell was the point of this movie?      P.S. London only looks like New York City if you don't live in New York City.
0618680004|5.0|No one should be surprised if the people who do not like or understand Dawkins' book resort to a variety of faulty arguments in trying to combat the author's bold assertions and the fairly clear and direct arguments he uses to support them.  I would like to point out the repeated use of what I consider false analogies by Dawkins' critics, specifically the use of religious parallels.  These are such statements as \\"Dawkins is preaching to the choir,\\" \\"Dawkins is a fundamentalist himself,\\" \\"Atheism is just another belief system,\\" and so on.  I personally think these phrases very telling, since Dawkins is trying to make exactly this point: that the poverty of religiously influenced thinking is such that people can't tell the difference between good and bad arguments.  Many religious people will only assume Dawkins is trying to replace their beliefs with other beliefs.  They are so used to being indoctrinated that they can't easily tell when someone is giving full credit to their potential intelligence by instead trying to persuade them of certain truths on the basis of carefully collected and organized factual information.  Yes, his tone is excited and sometimes over the top, but the facts are still there in his presentation.  You don't have to like the man to learn something from him.<br /><br />That said, I would also like to say I was myself persuaded by many of the author's arguments.  I would not previously have called myself an atheist, but now I will.  Dawkins has removed the stigma that word had in my mind by making it clear to me that honesty leads to atheism, and that those who revile atheists often do so reflexively, without really thinking at all.
B000F48CD8|3.0|This is a good album but I havn't got that much into it the way I do \\"White Stripes\\" & \\"Greenhornes\\" albums if I didn't know who the \\"Greenhornes\\" and \\"White Stripes\\" were I don't think I would be that much into this band. Best song on the album for me is 'Level' for obvious reason it rocks hard like granite, anyways I hope this is a one time deal because I am really looking foward to hearing a new \\"Greenhornes\\" album and that 6th \\"White Stripes\\" album Jack says he only needs 2min to record.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|Do I really need to type a review of this \\"more of the same\\"?  Seriouly people, stop hoping and start listening.   They obviously ran out of ideas a few albums ago.   If they're going to at least record a \\"comeback album\\" they should make sure that it's not recorded \\"underwater\\" (production wise). <br /> <br />P.J. can rock out and that will be cool.   But stop make excuses for this sleepfest. <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I bought this album the day it came out but put off reviewing it this long. It had to grow on me. At first I really only liked 2 songs, one of which (\\"Call Me When You're Sober\\") I'd already heard often enough to like already, on the radio and such.  <br /> <br />Now, a good month in, I have to agree with what many are saying. It's a good album and a strong return. No sophmore slump (well, technically it'd be junior but since \\"Origins\\" is so hard to find that most people don't even know it exists...) on this album. The only song I really still don't care for is #10, \\"The Only One\\". It's boring and I'm not a fan of the electronic sound it has. I'm also not too fond of \\"Lose Control\\" <br /> <br />Other songs such as \\"Snow White Queen\\", \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Weight of the World\\", \\"Good Enough\\", and what I think is my favorite Evanescence song yet, \\"Lithium\\" are really good and while similar to the content off of \\"Fallen\\" also different and more true to their goth roots. There's alot more piano solos and Amy does more voice work on this one, although I will say, in my opinion, this album isn't going to be as radio friendly as \\"Fallen\\" since it's a little darker and more gothy.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Al Gore created the film AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH as an important step to alert the global audience to the threat of global warming that is all too terrifying.  Some may dismiss this well-made documentary as Gore's reaction to the election debacle that placed our current 'President' in an undeserved office, but that is just another true piece of this alerting film.  Gore is the preacher/prophet here and he comes off as an admirable, warm, human, wise teacher whose mission is to bring us all into action.<br /><br />The facts are now clear, thanks in many ways to both Gore's book and film.  Gore takes the role of professor here and demonstrates by graphs and charts and then terrifyingly real photographic comparative images just how endangered our planet really is.  This may not be a film that allows us to put our heads on restful pillows at night, but then that is the purpose.  Without threats, without shouting from the pulpit, Gore merely relays the facts, negates the skeptics, and finally extends his hand to show each of us how we can participate in change, be that change communicating with our government officials to take immediate action or how to convert our own walking atmosphere into a healing place.<br /><br />Art has always opened the windows of light on society's foibles.  AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH does just that and now that the DVD is out perhaps even broader coverage of this disastrous situation will find its way into the homes of everyone.  We are all involved in the warming of the globe: we are all responsible and must excite change.  Grady Harp, November 06
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|The listener is captured by the essence of U2 in some of their finest songs ever recorded. In turn I believe each listener will be caught up in the essence of all that U2 (and Bono especially) encapsulates within and exudes without through the enchanting lyrics and the all-time connection with their listeners. One lover to another, we as artists ourselves appreciate the beauty that is the poetry of... U2.      The new tracks \\"Saints Are Coming\\" - Green Day, U2,  and \\"Window in the Skies\\" are brilliant additions to the already spot on  line up of U2 favourites included.  As for the live tracks, not a single performer or group of performers can equal the powerful presence that Bono, The Edge, Larry and Adam bring to the stage.  Even recorded live performances by U2 bring you to another realm and you find that you lose yourself in a world where you are the sole member of the audience who has been pulled onstage to accompany The Boys from Ireland in their glorious moments of superstardom.    Although I have the Complete U2 Collection from iTunes (with over 400 songs and digital book) as well as a full collection of their other albums and most of their books,,, I was desperate to secure yet another piece of U2's history. The added benefit is that the proceeds from the sale of this album benefit \\"Music Rising\\", the charitable organisation that The Edge has established to help the musicians that are victims of Hurricane Katrina.     I can, without a doubt, assure you that U2 is THE greatest rock band in the WORLD!    [...]

0743289412|2.0|This book is incessantly repetitious without a forward thrust. The language is geared to a ten year old. (Bool, anybody?) Add a few dashes of misogyny (e.g. Lisey gets a phone call warning her she'll be cut up in a very delicate place) and you have a miserable reading experience. At one time, Mr. King was underrated by the critics. Now it is the other way around. This whole opening section (the 140 pages) could have been cut down to 20 without any character or plot loss. Lisey's Endless Story is only a necessity for die-hard King fans.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Bringing back the wonderful set of characters that were so fondly remembered from Final Fantasy VII game on the Playstation.  This movie sets a wonderful backdrop of beautiful visuals that at times are very lifelike.  The musical score and voice acting are excellent for an English translation.  Watching this movie trully sets a tone for the environmental movement.  The message is clear.  The Earth will strike on those who harm it so.  This tale is set in a futristic world in the Final Fantasy Universe.  The place is very similar to Earth but has noticable differences.  Mainly being the use of magic.  Although these individuals have had much of their world destroyed from the battles of the past.  They live in a dreary dark place where people are being taken over by a mutant virus that will eventually kill them.  Their are subtle but strong spiritual overtones.  With a cathedral being home to flowers and the only rays of sunlight that pierce thru the holes in the roof.<br /><br />Overall I would say this is a wonderful movie to watch whether you are a Final Fantasy fan or just enjoy excellent animation and storyline.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, if not my favorite.  Unbelievable to me how people get their \\"shorts in a knot\\" about the previews.  Fast forward through them.  Jeez!  Don't tell me you can't with your edition.  I got this DVD on the day it came out and certainly can.  Incredibly screwed up to give a \\"poor rating\\" to a great movie, just because of some previews.  That's life.  While you are forwarding, go get yourself a brew!!  Don't cost nothin'!!!!!!
B000J10EQU|4.0|I really enjoyed this film at the theater.  It begs to be watched on a really large screen.  Even if viewed on a 60 inch television it will not deliver the same punch.  Where's the DTS audio track?  Certainly movie makers are aware by now that home theater freaks know the difference. The absence of the superior DTS audio format will make this a rental rather than purchase item for me.  I grew up watching the original Superman series on tv.  Part of the charm of the Superman saga is the innocence of the character relationships.  The decision to write an illegitimate child into the story line (no matter who the father is revealed to be) might have \\"updated\\" it for a population that doesn't bother to marry before pregnancy. Sadly, it does nothing to recommend the film to a younger generation which desperately needs heros to emulate. <br />The special effects are marvelous.  The acting is quite good especially Brandon Routh.  Kate Bosworth comes across as Superbitch not Lois Lane.  Guess that's because she still loves Superman but is driven to make him suffer (explain that to me girls).  One real surprise choice is Brian Singer's decision to mute the color renditions; especially Superman's outfit.  No brilliant reds and blues in the costume as we are accustomed to seeing.  Colors appear almost as a comic book page come to life. Of course that might have been the intent.  To sum up, a good movie theater experience but rental only for home viewing. Children under twelve shouldn't see it.
1401301363|4.0|I bought this first Nigella book after making the quadruple chocolate loaf cake recipe from her television show.  Some bloggers have given the recipe bad reviews on their sites but this was my first successful cake AND it was made in the food processor.  The homemade cake tastes just like the superexpensive exotic ingredients brownies sold at Bloomingdale's that I used to forego lunch to buy in high school.  I like this recipe because it works and it uses ingredients that I usually have on hand otherwise cookbooks are just for browsing.<br /><br />I made the cake a second time and substituted olive oil for the butter and 2 spoons of Hellman's mayo for the sour cream because I was out of the proper ingredients and the cake still turned out fantastic.  FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I caught her new show just as she was starting this recipe so I saved the last half of her show on dvr and it is still on my dvr so I can have it playing whenever I make another loaf.  A reviewer on another cookbook wrote that this other tv cook did not ever give measurements on her tv show so that one would have to buy her books but upon reflection, I have never bought a tv cook's books who did NOT give measurements on their shows.  Unconsciously, I seem to be less interested in finding the books of those handful of tv cooks who don't give measurements and watching their shows  is just vegging out in front of the tv set.  The best tv cooks get you out of your seat and into the kitchen.  I never did that watching Nigella Bites but I bought three of her cookbooks after catching that half-episode of Feast even though Feast does recycle some recipes from the other two books.  The perfect success of the cake made me believe in Nigella.  There are just too many cooks with books with similar recipes to know what to buy and a search on Amazon will show that every five years, the same ideas and themes get recycled.  Letting the consumer test drive the product brings in hesitating bystanders like me.<br /><br />p.s. I just made the chocolate gingerbread and it is very good so long as it is not overcooked.the chocolate gingerbread and it is very good so long as it is not overcooked.
B00064WSNW|5.0|What King Crimson fan doesn't have this album in their collection? Thats like not having Peter Frampton Comes Alive or Led Zepplins ZOSO.This one IS A classic example of Robert Fripp craftsmanship.King Crimson is a take it or leave band.You either admire them or not.They never got the attention they deserve but thats cool with me.They are spared the misery of popism and overkill.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We may never see more stories about the crew of Serenity but the Firefly Season One is a great viewing experience.  I really liked watching it all at once without commercials and I probably wouldn't have been able to sustain my interest when it aired on Fox since it was aired out of sequence.  If this series were to return on a cable channel such as HBO or Showtime especially if showcase on the On Demand channel, then this series would deservedly flourish and gain a bigger following. I recommend seeing this series before seeing the film Serenity.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|If you already have everything U2 has ever done, the only reason to get this would be for the DVD.  At only 10 songs, that may be a bit steep.  It was worth it to me though.  Great DVD by Hamish, in the quality of the Boston and Chicago shows.   <br /> <br />\\"The Saints\\" was awesome on the album.  Other than that, not necessarily a good deal unless you're new to U2.  Pretty good selection, but missing some big ones like \\"Bad\\", probably because of time constraints on the CD.  We'll just have to wait a few years for the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD audio greatest hits in 7.1 surround with 30 songs!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of The Beatles, and the very idea of this album sent me into a whirlwind of anxiety.  How could the most beautiful and accomplished body of work in pop music possibly be improved by \\"mixing\\" and \\"editing\\"?  But now, having heard it, I realize there was no cause for concern.  The Martins didn't improve the music of The Beatles;  that would be impossible.  But they didn't destroy it, either.  What they did was present it in a different language, if you will, by amping-up the bass, making the drums heavier, adding string fillers, creating sound effects, cleaning up the original sound until it is crystal clear, and, of course, cutting and pasting individual vocal and instrumental lines of the existing tracks to form new vocal and instrumental lines.  Another thing:  by stringing a lot of the tracks together without breaks, they formed larger bodies of music which resemble the movements of, um, what would Diana Ross call it?  \\"...a SYM-phony!\\"  I can't imagine that anyone who likes Beatle music would not like this CD, but I guess there are those who just want it left as it is.  For those who are not familiar with the original music, it's hard to say.  They might not \\"get\\" it.  On the other hand, they just might consider it one of the most strange and awesome things they have ever heard.  For me personally, it is like the deification of The Beatles.  The treatment lovingly applied by the Martins makes the music all the more grandiose than it already was.  That might be overkill for some people, but I like drama, and this to me is an album on a celestially dramatic level.  And I have to say this - is there a vocal more flawless than John's on \\"A Day In The Life\\"?  If there is, I haven't heard it yet...
B000BTGY1O|1.0|This film lose its innocence when we can see a tool of torture, -used in the cruel bullfightings- in the hand of Jose Da Silva Pereira, on a scene at the stairs. This fact spoils everything.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|My comments are in two categories, namely \\"King Kong\\" - the movie and secondly the HDDVD experience.  <br /> <br />The storyline is excellent, I liked the added underlying story about Denham's reliance on his movie for final success or failure. The development of Kong's arrival at least an hour and a half into the movie was excellent, the tribal scenes were well done, the wrecking of the ship, and much much more. I saw this movie as a kid in the 70's, and now we have a very much updated version for our kids. So for the movie, I give it 5 stars ***** <br /> <br />Now, onto the HDDVD, content. I thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the non-HD version, then when I saw it in HD, I was in awe, the graphics are even richer, my kids point out they can see flashes of light in places that were not there in the regular DVD, that Kong looks so much better, the landscape and overall beauty of this film shows its true colors in HD. So for the HDDVD I have no choice but to give it 5 stars as well ***** <br /> <br />To the nay-sayers out there, please do check your setup, my HDDVD player is an XBOX based player, the XBOX then connects via. a composite RGB cable to an Onkyo A/V receiver(TX-SR674), the receiver then connects via. and HDMI cable to a Sony WEGA Rear Projection 1080i television. If you have not set things up correctly, you may not get the experience you are looking for.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Horror mocking is awesome, espessially for horror fans who know whats going on.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin has always seemed to be a gem among gems. When you combine Robert Plant's spirited vocals, Jimmy Page's outrageously revolutionary guitar playing, John Paul Jones's wizardry over the bass and keys, and of course, John Bonham's masterful madhouse of drumming, you get the rock and roll behemoth that is Led Zeppelin. And while they have given birth to such popular songs as the haunting \\"Kashmir\\" (Physical Grafitti), the heavenly headbanger \\"Communication Breakdown\\" (Led Zeppelin 1) and what is probably the greatest rock and roll song ever \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" (Zoso), this album is something even more.    Back in 1969, when people were probably least expecting it, came along this titan of an album. Within are tree-trunk drums, deep basslines, soaring vocals, and a truckload of awesome guitar riffs. For musicians, this album is like gold, for it forever changed guitar and drum playing. And for music lovers everywhere, it's a festival of good old rock 'n' roll music. Through these nine tracks, the four, then-young rockers of Led Zep take you through a journey of funk-influenced, strongly blues-based hard rock that is sheer joy.    \\"Whole Lotta Love\\": A great song carried by the legendary guitar riff and similar bassline. After a minute and a half long break of percussion, guitar effects and spacey vocals, which give this song a very surreal feel to it, a smashing solo rips through by none other than Jimmy Page!    \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\": Progressive verses build up to an explosive and very funky chorus, along with some mystical lyrics to accompany this very cool song.    \\"The Lemon Song\\": A slower and longer song that's quite blues-based, where John Paul Jones shines as a bassist. Just goes to show how underrated the man was as a musician.    \\"Thank You\\": An excellent ballad combining superior acoustic guitars, dreamy keyboard lines, and an amazing vocal/lyrical. A truly beautiful song to put it simply.    \\"Heartbreaker\\": A personal gem on the album. The funky drums and stunning guitar riff carry this song through. It's also got two of the greatest guitar solos of all time. Definitely one of Zeppelin's best songs.    \\"Living Loving Maid\\": I just don't understand why the band doesn't care for this song, because it's great. Even though it's short, at only two and a half minutes, the heavy drumbeat and funky riff make this one a real rocker.    \\"Ramble On\\": Starts off acoustic but has a great build-up. The instrumentation and lyrics make this one an awesome Led Zeppelin folk song, as they have done some great ones.    \\"Moby Dick: Legendary drum performance, pure and simple. Every drummer should listen to this, as it changed drumming history for good. Of course, this has something for guitarists/guitar enthusiasts, too, as it's got a fantastic, but incredibly deep, slow-strut riff to it.    \\"Bring It On Home\\": A wonderful closer to the album. The first thirty seconds are bass-playing and Robert Plant on the harmonica. Actually, this works really well, as this song, like others, has a build-up. At the high point of the song, the guitar and drums come in for an excellent solo and stellar riff.    Basically speaking, this album inspired a generation. Everything about this album is great, as every song is strong, some, though, stronger than others. But to get my point across, this is a milestone in classic rock history and I would definitely recommend this, especially to classic rock/guitar/Led Zeppelin fans, especially newcomers to Led Zeppelin. Hope you all enjoy this one, 'cause like I've said before, it's a real gem!
B000AP04EW|4.0|This movie is 100 percent enjoyable entertainment.  It's a Pitt and Jolie masterpiece; but there's surely nothing challenging about the plot beyond watching both these superstars strut their amazing and magnetic screen stuff. But, it's nevertheless enough to entertain with breathless random. I liked this movie because of the crazy twists in the plot and the witty and camp style of the alluring dialogue.  This is a good Saturday night movie with just enough chick flick appeal melded with high quality testosterone.  I'd watch it again, just to see Pitt and Jolie together. They are as masterful in their creative roles as the Movie plot is preposterous.
0765315246|5.0|This book does not require any advanced education in physics, as some Sci-Fi does.  It does not require you to learn a whole new universe with new languages and odd cultures.  In fact the only effort that this book requires of the reader is the hard work of sitting and enjoying a truly excellent story.<br /><br />This book does not resort to any fancy literary devices or try to be cute and clever - it is simply really good writing that tells a really good story.  Straight, simple, good.<br /><br />One warning - don't read this book within a year or two of reading 'Starship Trooper' - both excellent books, so enjoy them separately with a little time in between.
032147404X|5.0|I loved this book.  He teaches you how to get those shots that you see in magazines and it was especially helpful to me because it gave a lot of information about the Nikon DSLR and how to use them.  I would highly recommend this book to all beginner and intermediate photographers.  Thanks to Scott for the easy to understand lessons!
0743289412|5.0|Although I had a hard time getting into the story once I was there I was hooked.  This is Stephen King in his finest back with a thought provoking book.  Lisey shares her deep grief in a different way, Scott does an excellent job of describing his childhood horrors and I'm sure nightmares.  Lisey's sister Amanda is a cutter and for those of you that aren't in the know, this could really happen. Wake up people, you are being introduced to a world that few know.  I would liken this book to Misery.  Parts of it could happen to you!!!!
B000IU3XU6|2.0|I have to say that I was tremendously disappointed in Josh's latest album. I've always loved Josh Groban, and think that he is a mega-talent, but the music in this album is just plain mediocre, at best, and does nothing to showcase his talent. He also uses quite a bit of falsetto, which I personally, dislike. At other times, he seems to be reaching for his top notes, and they appear thinner in sound, which is something that was not evident in his earlier albums.  There is not a single hit on this cd. The mood of this album is also completely depressed!! I realize that artists must share their innermost soul, to feel that they are being true to themselves, but, I would prefer that Josh sing music that is more uplifting, like his earlier albums. After listening to \\"Awake\\" you just want to slit your wrists and end it all!!  Josh, please, please, please go back to what you do best.  This foray into a more far-out pop style makes you sound just like any other singer.  Your uniqueness is in bringing the classical sound to the masses.
B00005OBSD|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars and then some. The song going down slow will blow your mind, and is worth it alone. Paul Kossoff's ( Guitar absoutly screams! It is so ,bluesy and heartfelt, that it send shivers down your spine. Brilliant and masterful playing.This is a must have not only for blues/rock fans, but anyone who is into good music. Solid start to finish, you won't be sorry.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|While I haven't yet heard the surround-sound version, I was awestruck by the stereo PCM mix on the dvd disc. The bass sounds alone are worth the price of admission, and it's a real tribute to the original EMI team that these tracks sound so fantastic. George and Giles Martin have done a wonderful job of mixing up the original tracks, a two year task, to come up with something that evokes the excitement of Cirque de Soleil, while staying true to the Beatles' musical vision, leaning heavily on their psychedelic era. The Martin's sonic experiments don't always work, as in the throw-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink ending on \\"Strawberry Fields\\", or the backwards \\"Sun King\\", and we've already heard \\"Because\\" a capella on the Anthology series, adding bird and bug sounds does not help, the original Abbey Road version still rules. But these are minor quibbles; mostly, it's delightful, and often surprising, as when the strings from \\"Good Night\\" are used behind Ringo's \\"Octopus' Garden\\" vocal track. Also, many of the songs are presented more or less intact-\\"Revolution\\" is a revelation, and it certainly whets one's appetite for the coming remixes of the Beatles catalog.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is a very intelligent man. He has been writing about evolutionary biology since the 1970's, and his \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was revolutionary in gene-centric views of evolution. As an athiest, Dawkins is not a quiet guy. He not only does not believe in any religion, he believes religion is essentially a bad institution, especially its indoctrination of young children. I agree with most of what he says, but his lack of expertise shows through at times. For example, Dawkins demostrates pretty conclusively that people do not get their morals from religion, but the alternatives he presents are sparse. This is a fact that he admits, but it still amounts to only half of an argument. Dawkins does not seek to 'convert' people to atheism per se in this book, but rather to demonstrate the falsehoods and negatives of religion. He does admirably in this attempt, with ample quotations as a result of his admitted lack of expertise. However, despite the drawbacks of Dawkins' non-religious studies background, he is a phenomenal thinker and writer, and thus I would recommend this book to anybody.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that I am a big Loreena McKennitt fan, owning almost every CD she has ever released.  Because of the powerful beauty of her other albums, I was excited to learn that she had a new one coming out and rushed to pre-order it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album just doesn't meet the high standard of her other works.  Though it's a perfectly lovely recording, it lacks the power of previous releases.  The main reasons it doesn't have quite the punch to which we are accustomed are the following:<br /><br />1.  There's a lot less of McKennitt's singing on this one than usual.  While the instrumentation is quite fine, I am much more interested in her voice than in hearing track after track of wordless music.<br /><br />2.  Her other albums have varying tempos, with some slower and some faster songs throughout; this one features slow songs exclusively, all with similar tempo.<br /><br />3.  The style is very similar on each song, leaving me feeling like I heard the same song already a couple of times with different words by the end of the album.<br /><br />It really is a pleasant recording, but easy to ignore where the others have my grabbed attention and held it.  I really wish I could give this as great a rating as I was expecting, but I can't.  I will say that my infant son fell right asleep while listening, so grab it up if you need a good lullaby CD!
B000I5X81A|5.0|...this is the kind of stuff you'll get. I mean, music. With real instruments and real feeling.<br /><br />Although not characteristic for each one's style, this record has everything: Clapton's sliding riffs from \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" (\\"Missing Person\\"), a bit of bluesy \\"Shades\\" on a classic Dixie remake (Taj Mahal's harmonica on \\"Sporting Life Blues\\" helps a lot), a bit of \\"5\\" (\\"Don't Cry Sister\\"), the southern moods of \\"Okie\\" (\\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\" - fantastic remake), some sunny rays of bluegrass (\\"Dead end Road\\"), the slow harmonic turns of \\"Cherry\\" on \\"8\\" (\\"Who Am I Telling You?\\") - the vinyl version...<br /><br />A JJ addict? A must have. A Clapton fan? Then watch the movie above and hear Clapton's words: \\"There's one thing I'd love to do before I go underground: a JJ-like record...\\"
B000H305U0|3.0|I thought every review was going to give this album 5 stars, until I check them out, so now I don't feel alone.  <br />Intitally, after I heard Sexyback and I decided to buy the whole album, because it seemed a bit different from Justin's previous work. Justin also gets hyped like crazy. So maybe my expectations were too high. It's definately a decent album with top notch production. I'd say my favorite songs are: 'FutureSex/Lovesound', 'Sexyback', 'Let Me Talk To You' (prelude), 'Set The Mood' (prelude), 'Damn Girl', and if I push myself.. 'My Love' (though the video helped a bit). The rest of the songs get skipped.  <br />I got through them the first few times, but they just didn't grow on me at all. I never expected to skip most of the album. I wish the preludes had been separated from the previous song, so I could listen to 'Let Me Talk To You' (prelude) without having to sit through 'Sexy Ladies'. The crazy thing is 'Sexy Ladies' sounds ok musically (the production plays a big part), as do the other songs I skip, but the lyrics just don't help it. The lyrics are still generic(like on Justified), though on 'Losing My Way' there's a socially conscious moment(..with generic lyrics). But Timberlake can sing and his confidence coats everything and makes it listenable. But on '(Another Song) All Over Again', I think he could have pushed the vocals alot further than he did. That was the only song I've ever heard him on, where I noticed his vocal limitations. <br />Alot of people just love this album so maybe you will too. Is it a step above 'Justified'? Um, I skipped less songs on Justified, but the stronger songs improved upon the previous albums formulas. Overall it's fun and danceable.
B00005JPAD|1.0|Once upon a time Martin Scorcese was able to do great movies like the age of inocence. But that time is long gone. Now he really just wants to make money. And money he did..  <br />The script of the movie is quite stupid. The movie sometimes goes from one scene to the other without much being added to the storyline. There is lots of pointless violence. Cops are depicted as irrational individuals that say f*** all the time, like to punch each other and make their own justice.  <br />Besides being stupid the movie is also boring and the shooting is crap. Directors nowadays shoot movies like an MTV videoclip. <br />Martin, please pay that mortgage soon and start shooting real movies again... <br />

B0006A9FKA|4.0|This delightful comedy not only pays tribute to the 'zombie' movie, it also takes the mickey out of them at the same time. Targeting Dawn of the Dead, it reunites the team that made the English sitcom 'Spaced'.<br /><br />Shaun has just been dumped by his girlfriend, fails to gain the respect of his work colleagues, having trouble with his mother and is under increasing pressure from his flatmate to kick out his overweight, loud-mouthed unemployed best friend. Could his life be any worse? Well shaun wakes up one morning to find a deadly virus is quickly turning the population of England into zombies. In a hillarious scene with actor Nick Frost as his best friend Ed, Shaun at first thinks a female zombie who has wondered into his back garden is heavily intoxicated and trying to come on to him.<br /><br />Shaun comes up with a plan to rescue his mother and friends, including his ex and leading them to safety with the hope of winning back Liz, trying to show her he can be responsible and a reliable person.<br /><br />The storyline is your classic zombie tale, and the only zombie movie I can reacall where the word 'zombie' is actually used. All the entertainment however is in the jokes, especially from Nick Frost who reminds me a bit of Jon Favreau's humour. This is worth buying as it is very fun to watch from time to time. Is also loaded with heaps of special features.<br /><br />Also stars Dylan Moran from the brit comedy 'black books', a show which has featured many of the cast from the movie over the years. And Lucy Davis from 'the office'.
B000059XUP|3.0|Seeing The Crow flash across the screen again was something I wasn't sure I'd be able to experience again after the tragic misfortunes of the first Crow movie.  I've heard it said that one of the crew members on the first movie actually thought it was cursed.<br /><br />But this second movie, which is based around a new Crow (Vincent Perez) and the returning Sarah from the first movie (played in this one by the beautiful and dark Mia Kirshner) wasn't cursed like the first one, the curse this had was that it was a sequel to something that likely didn't need one.  Although I enjoyed the dark circumstances that surrounded the actual onscreen play, with the nod to \\"La Dia De los Muertos\\" (The Day Of The Dead) being my favorite, the story about a murdered father who returns to avenge his son, to me, takes away from the romantic overtones of the first movie and the Crow comic book overall.<br /><br />The original story was written by James O'Barr to help him exorcize the demons he lived with after losing his first love early in life and he's made mention that in truth, the Crows story was told then, and in his eyes had been told completely.  But as with all things we find interesting or fall in love with, it was decided that there needed to be more, so they made more.<br /><br />I kind of doubt Brandon Lee would have come back for the sequel if he'd lived as I'm sure he would have felt, as O'Barr did, that Eric Dravens story had been told.  I make a few leaps here, making mention of things James has said to me and maybe a little of what I hope Brandon Lee would have done had he survived the accident that took his life, but I make them with the best intentions.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, being a comic book geek, I was sure I would.  I have to admit to having felt a little betrayed when the sequel came out, just as I was when the ensuing comic follow-ups came out, but the Crow has become an avenger of wrongs that couldn't be put right any other way, a dark hero to the masses who suffer and have no way to let that out other than to dream of a hero who would go beyond death to right their wrongs and although Eric and Shelleys story was told to completion, there are more stories to tell.  This is one of them.  There are others, there will be others, likely as many as there are people with stories of their own, because truly, who among us doesn't feel the need at some point in our lives to be avenged?<br /><br />See the movie, be forewarned that it contains violence in the extreme, some nudity and a lot of what might be termed \\"the darker aspects of life\\", drugs, gangs, betrayels, S&M and torture.

If you go in with no expectations based on the first movie or the comic book, this 3 stars quickly becomes 3 1/2 or 4.to the masses who suffer and have no way to let that out other than to dream of a hero who would go beyond death to right their wrongs and although Eric and Shelleys story was told to completion, there are more stories to tell.

B000HT386M|4.0|... and it surely isn't going to win any best actor awards, but it was uproariously funny and had a moral. Walken was, once again, a great weird/bad guy, but not a bad guy... is it my imagination or does he play the angel of death a large number of times in his career? And what was it with his dancing? He actually CAN dance, but he sure didn't look like it at the wedding scene.<br /><br />Anyway, Sandler's acting is sub-par, but that's nothing new to me. I adore Winkler, though, and think he did a superb job on his part in the movie as well.<br /><br />There were some moments in the movie I literally laughed out loud, and I'm not usually one to do that. The liposuction scene, \\"It looks like a tongue,\\" just killed me!<br /><br />It's a decent movie for kids, but it does have a few sexually suggestive scenes with the animals, so probably not for the very young crowd, but my pre-teen loved it and laughed big belly laughs all the way through.<br /><br />It's definitely worth the watch.

0671799320|5.0|\\"Behind every great fortune is a great crime.\\"  The fortunes discussed here involve oil.  Two of the most interesting figures are Rockefeller Sr., who is portrayed as a miserly monopolist; and Gulbenkian, an Armenian philosopher and consummate businessman.  Getty, the muckrackers, and other historical figures are also mentioned in detail.  But Yergin's book--more accurately described as a delightful tome--does not stop there.  He covers world leaders from Eisenhower--who stopped the British from re-taking the Suez Canal post-Nasser--to the Shah, who replaced, then jailed, Mossadegh.<br /><br />A major historical omission Yergin makes is that he fails to note Kermit Roosevelt's possible role in Operation Ajax, which is discussed in Perkins' _Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_.  Still, the scope of this book is incredible.  We learn that oil was around one dollar a barrel in the 1940's (meaning our addiction to \\"black gold\\" is fairly new); that BP is the successor to the nationalized Anglo-Persian Oil Company; that U.S. and British policy wished to prevent Anglo-Persian's oil from falling into Communist hands, making today's current events especially interesting; that one possible reason we, rather than the British, have a special relationship with Saudi Arabia may involve FDR's superior knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, as well as his polio; that at one point, Venezuela and Mexico were our major suppliers of oil, with Venezuela supplying 55% of the U.S.'s oil (Today, Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela still supply most of our oil); that Leavittown gave rise to suburbs (fun quote from its founder: \\"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist.  He has too much to do.\\"); and much more.  This book should be required reading in every history classroom in America.  It enlivens history with its detailed depictions of characters who changed the course of world history.  It is around 800 pages in paperback, and is, without question, worth the time investment.
B000ADKTSA|5.0|South Korea has been making some outstanding movies these last couple of years, but unfortunately not many people have given enough credit to these remarkable movies.<br /><br />The director Chan-wook Park showed what he was capable of doing in South Korea with his first smash hit movie Joint Security Area.<br /><br />After that he went into a complete different territory with the very dark, but excellent thriller Sympathy for Mr Vengeance.<br /><br />Due to it's dark theme Sympathy failed to attract the repeated success of Joint Security Area.<br /><br />Did that stop Chan-wook Park from making more movies?<br /><br />Absolutely not!<br /><br />Chan-Wook Park is back with a Vengeance himself giving us the Ultimate Revenge Masterpiece Oldboy!<br /><br />I wish I can comment more on this movie, but doing that could be a threat in spoiling this amazing experience in cinematic history!<br /><br />Instead I will focus my review on the acting and direction of the movie. As many are aware now, the movie revolves around a man imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years. The motive of the movie is revenge. But the most important answer to all this revenge is WHY????<br /><br />This movie will litterly have you nailed to your seat. Yes, it's very violent, I would say graphic as in the likes of Last house on the left, though NEVER exploited in that sense. This movie is all brains!<br /><br />The direction is the first thing that will have you in awe. From the first 15mins of the movie, you will see how masterfully this movie is shot. In a split screen scene you will actually feel what this man has missed in those 15 years imprisoned in this apartment. His anger for his imprisonment, the complete mess in his look and clothes are all truly convincing by Choi Min-shik who has appeared in two other big Korean movies which are Failan and the award winning movie at Cannes last year Chihwaseon.<br /><br />As I have already mentioned the violence is very graphic and will probably be rated in the USA NC17. Which is understandable. But do not let that cursed rating put you off. This movie is bound to have you talking and discussing for days if not for months. Just be very well prepared for the final shocking twist!<br /><br />Well done Chan-wook Park you have showed the world what a truly excellent film director you are. Oldboy gets a well deserved 10/10will probably be rated in the USA NC17. Which is understandable. But do not let that cursed rating put you off.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I went to see John the second day after his album was released.  I saw him on the Harbor in San Diego and it was awesome.  John and his band played all of the songs perfectly and it was a spectacular show.  I have always liked John Mayer but this album took that liking up another notch or two.  All the songs on the album are good and it really seems like he has changed his style to a more Jazzy/Blues style.  The song \\"Stop This Train\\" has a very similar message to the Jack Johnson tune \\"Breakdown\\".  I would highly reccomend this album to anyone that has even the slightest interest in John Mayer, you wont be dissapointed.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|What a surprise!!!!! Nearly every song is above average...no fillers!!!! Stay Beautiful is the best song on the album-better than Tim McGraw. You'll hit repeat on the ipod over and over again for that song alone.  <br />I didn't expect this album to be this good. The song released on the radio right now, Tim McGraw, is catchy but not vocally impressive. Taylor seems a little bland on the song and her range is limited. With that in mind, I expected the rest of the songs to be similar. On the contrary, the other songs show off her talents much, much more.  <br />You'll find a couple songs are very popish and you will unfortunately forget you are even listening to country at times. Similar in sound to Michelle Branch's pop songs pre-The Wreckers. Regardless if they are country or pop they are good songs. Overall, this is a very good CD and you wont regret your purchase.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|A huge fan of both the comics and the cartoon series, I loved the first X-Men, particularly the way Singer created an ensemble team, combined the mutants' talents, and made them explode on screen (sans funny spandex costumes). The second was also enjoyable, although the original remains my favorite. The third was an absolute mess. A feast for the eyes, certainly, in terms of special effects and action, but it had little appreciation for the characters. <br /> <br />Unlike the first two films, there is a lack of focus on our mutants. They are merely warriors within an army, without character or cause. There are too many of them - the audience gets lost in a visual series of \\"powers,\\" and it seems Ratner was merely using the premise of the X-Men and mutants purely to display some sort of special effects mastery. You really only see glimpses when you hope to see the whole picture. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the explanation of the Phoenix, as both the comics and cartoon were often unclear about the hows and whys. And Famke Jenssen does a masterful job with all her silent gazes and glares. But Xaviar is cast off too quickly and without purpose. What little script that exists is canned and even corny. And the film disregards too many of our feature mutants. Rogue - one of my favorites from the comics - is incredibly powerful, but she is nonexistent in the film. She serves almost no purpose, which is a complete waste. Mystique is also wasted. She was so awesome in X2, I would have hoped to see a repeat performance. <br /> <br />In a nutshell: sorry premise, misuse of mutants, too many mutants to identify with any of the characters, and hardly more than a special effects fun fair.  <br /> <br />I would LOVE to see another X-Men ensemble, but only if it returns to its roots as envisioned by Bryan Singer.
0446310786|5.0|It's more than a story or a tale, it is the kind of book you keeps thinking on it 10 years after you read it. <br /> <br />It's about sanity, about the freedom you are ready to grasp without failling into madness, or just otherness.. <br /> <br />Recently I discovered an step in project plan called \\"sanity check\\", I recalled the book inmediatly.  As I told before is a book about sanity and freedom. You'll find yourself inbedded in the characters, feeling the loose borders of the reality. Doubting your own borders and assumptions, stretching the hand beyond the walls of your own freedom and sensing the feeling the panic behind.
B000784WMW|3.0|Jane Eyre is my favorite book; I've read it three times.  The only reason I gave this movie three stars is because the movie followed the book very well.   <br /> <br />Clarke was a fair Jane, though I don't think she captured her passion at all.  She was entirely too calm when Jane should have been a lot more passionate.  And there were moments in the movie when she seemed very pretty and as much as we would like Jane Eyre to be pretty, she is not in the least. <br /> <br />Dalton was a very poor Rochester.  He acted the part very badly and he and Clarke clearly had no chemistry.  I also think that he played the part a little too angrily, though that could have just been bad acting.

George Martin is a genious, but he bombed on this one.    There are apx 20+ songs on here.  They are fantastic songs, but they sound completley unchanged.  I feel like I just rebought a greatest hits album I already own!  The Beatles songs are gourgeous on their own, but the thing that upsets me, is this album was completely FALSELY ADVERTISED.[...]    I originally bought this album after listening to the 4 tracks on the beatles myspace[...]    Those songs were so gourgeously redone and are truly novel gems.  Bad news, is the rest are so minimally altered, you cant even tell the difference.    If you are a purist this is fine, it is like being tricked into rebuying another greatest hits album.[...]

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Saw a special screening. I enjoyed it a lot, but I can imagine just how really amazing it would have been if Donner had the time, actors and money to shoot it like he wanted back in the late 70's and early 80's. Donner was forced to do this version based on the script only and the new scenes he only had. <br /> <br />The wrong thing to do is to compare Lester's overplayed version with Donner's. It's not fair to Donner. Watch Donner's version with a new perspective and think to yourselves, \\"if only he had been allowed to finish this version per his vision.\\" <br /> <br />The new Brando scenes were so cool to see as was the opening Daily Planet scene. The opening scene was especially good cause it was originally about 80 to 90 percent finished. Clark getting his powers back was definitely more dramatic and there was more at stake. It was a great scene and awesome to see. If only Donner had time to have shot more coverage to let the scene run even smoother, then it would have been so perfect. <br /> <br />Editor Michael Thau did a Q&A afterwards and was very detailed about Donner's decisions and opinions. The new Superman II was based on the written script and what they had already shot. Mr. Thau said that Donner would have done an entirely different ending if he was allowed to finish. Remember in the script, in Superman I, Lois was supposed to die and the 3 villains escape. A cliff hanger. At the last second, it was decided that Superman turns the world around and we have the great ending we do. Donner is forced to do the same ending again in the new film cause that is all he had to work with. <br /> <br />The epic fight scene vs the 3 villains would have been more vicious, with the city and planet utterly destroyed. Fire and smoke covering the planet. What a visual. <br /> <br />Donner is a true visionary. I am grateful for his dedication and allowing us to glimpse what could have been. It still is a film very much worth seeing and owning on DVD.

B000H0MKOC|4.0|Thank You for Smoking is hilarious in the same way that watching Sasha Baren Cohen pretend to be an immigrant in Borat is hilarious.  It's funny because it's a film that can laugh at itself--and does so for nearly two hours.  For instance, in one scene the president of the Academy of Tobacco Studies says, \\"(Cigaretters) are cool, available, and addictive. The job's almost done for us.\\"  This movie is satirical without being too over the top and that's what makes it great. I mean what isn't funny about a group of best friends who call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death) and work as lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol, and firearms industries.  It's almost too much, but it's done so well that you can't help but laugh.  Also, one of the best parts of this movie is the far underrated performance of Adam Brody as the assistant of a Hollywood superagent played by Rob Lowe. Brody's scenes are some of the best in the movie and his immersion in the vapid, Los Angeles movie market makes for great movie-watching. I would definitely recommend Thank You for Smoking the next time you're in the mood for a laugh.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Recently I've gotten back into vinyl.  \\"Year of The Cat\\" is one of the handful of records I kept, and thank god for that moment of clarity!  I'm listening to this right now on a new turntable.  First time I've heard it in probably 2 decades.  The music really holds up - There's not a weak song on the entire album.  The recording quality is fantastic (recorded at Abbey Road in London).    Very highest recommendation.
0140157352|3.0|There is a lot of useful information in this book.  There are plenty of words in this book that add no value.  It was almost as if the authors were trying to fill space.

B00006IUL7|3.0|When I saw this film in the theaters back in 2002, I was blown away.  I had seen Christopher Nolan's Memento, and couldn't wait for his follow-up film.  I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams - a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together.  I was wrong.  I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast.  I was not disappointed.  When this film was released, I immediately bought it, poured it into my collection of films, and watched it at least a dozen times since then.  I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles.  I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play - and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit.  I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, clich&eacute; ending.  I was in awe of this film - that is - until I saw the original.  Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision.  It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the \\"How to build a great climax\\" handbook handed to new ... mainstream directors.<br /><br />For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good.  If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen.  I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments.  To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations.  While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his \\"unknown\\" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character.  You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is.  There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the \\"bad cop\\" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer.  Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt.  A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.<br /><br />Outside of the characters, Nolan's indiscreet changes do morph this film into something completely different that originally conceived.  To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake.  It is a new interpretation of a classic film.  Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film.  For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood \\"running\\" in Nolan's film than in the original.  Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace.  Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely.  That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form.  This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical.  Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months.  It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.<br /><br />Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia.  So, where does that put us currently?  I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say \\"no\\" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his \\"dark\\" stint).  I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films.  For that, I gotta respect him.  I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best.  Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino could not compete.  To summarize, together these two films cannot compare because the original is 100% better (because they ARE two separate films), but apart Nolan does cloak a good story with great cinematography.  So, I would suggest it.  Count me on the fence wit this one!!<br /><br />Grade: *** ½ out of *****e Hollywood \\"running\\" in Nolan's film than in the original.  Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace.  Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely.  That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form.  This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical.

0446677450|4.0|I have read this book as well as 3 of his other books within his \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" series.  I feel that this is a great motivational book.  I found his insight regarding quadrants interesting and the psychology of individuals who fall into each category.<br /><br />Overall - I find that Kiyosaki in ALL of the books that I have read, lacks real world \\"how to\\" information, and is basically a hypester.  I found this book enjoyable, however, don't look to this book for specific life altering information aside from basic adivce that most would believe leads to wealth such as: open and run successful businesses, accumulate appreciating paper assets (stocks,bonds,mutual funds...), and real estate investments.  Please don't expect to find coaching in this book regarding how run a successful business, or how to purchase and manage real estate investments or how to select paper investments.<br /><br />If you read this book you have read his entire series as I have yet to find a more redundant author.  I do overall recommend reading this book as I give it a rating of 4.  If you have had no financial guideance in your life and would like to begin somewhere, I feel that this book will get you motivated to improve your future.

Sure the guys of the band started to do weird things like dressing up in a radiation protection suit.  But no, this IS an album to be reckoned with.  Id say, the lyrics alone are Bono's greatest body of work since The Joshua Tree.  OK, yes there is some industrial loops and other technical jargon through the tunes.  But strip it back, and youve got something if not as strong, but maybe even stronger than Achtung Baby. It highlights the negative things that are happening in this world.  And Please. Will God Send His Angels?  Or will The Playboy Manson do anything for us? Or whilst Staring at the Sun, will this be our Last Night on Earth?  Who knows!  But no, it is sad what happend when this title came out.  Because it deserved alot more than what it got.

0618680004|2.0|From page 239 of `The God Delusion': <br /> <br />\\"In November 2005, the citizens of Dover, Pennsylvania, voted off their school board the entire slate of fundamentalists who had bought the town notoriety, not to mention ridicule, by attempting to enforce the teaching of `intelligent design'.\\" <br /> <br />Enforce the teaching of `intelligent design'?  Not so! <br /> <br />I quote below the actual Dover `intelligent design' policy from the NCSE website, a website that bills itself as follows: \\"This site is meant to be a public resource for understanding the legal issues involved in defending the teaching of evolution in public schools. It began as a resource site for the Kitzmiller v. Dover lawsuit, resolved on December 20, 2005.\\" <br /> <br />Q. What was the Dover \\"intelligent design policy\\"? <br />A. On October 18, 2004, the DASD added this statement to its science curriculum: Students will be made aware of gaps/problems in Darwin's Theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design. Note: Origins of life will not be taught.  On November 19, the DASD issued a statement to be read in biology classes, which said, in part: Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book Of Pandas and People is available for students to see if they would like to explore this view in an effort to gain an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves. As is true with any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind. <br />  <br />These, taken together, comprised the DASD \\"intelligent design policy\\". <br /> <br />The Dover school policy merely reminded students that evolution is only a theory, that there are alternative theories, and to keep an open mind.  Evolution was still to be taught, as required by Pennsylvania law, and intelligent design was not to be included as part of the curriculum.  Is reminding students to keep an open mind really unconstitutional? <br/> <br />Find this hard to believe?  The entire transcript of the trial and Judge Jone's ruling are available on the above mentioned website. <br /> <br />Dawkins' book is preaching to the choir--a stating of the standard arguments against religion. True, many of his arguments are valid, but not original. Dawkins is a kind of atheist's Ann Coulter--without the humor.  I was expecting more.     <br /> <br />

B000F7CMRM|3.0|Gee whiz! This really isn't \\"Traffic\\" or \\"Magnolia\\" it's just a really well done present day thriller. For almost three hours, it hardly goes beyond the surface of the multiple story lines. George Clooney's character is very well played. He is not \\"the sexiest man in the world\\" in this movie but an aging, over weight CIA spy cum-arms dealer who gets his fingernails wripped out before your eyes. It's kind of like James Bond meets the Maytag repairman! Okay, using the weapon that got away from Clooney to destroy the LNG tanker is a stretch but so was believing that Saddam Hussein had WMD - oh wait, they believed that one! <br />If you want a little escape get \\"Syriana\\". If you want some real escape, go get the old Mad Max boxed set and just ignore anything Mel Gibson has said in the last five years.
0765315246|5.0|There's a long, long tradition of military adventure in science fiction and it breaks into two types. The type worth reading examines motivation among soldiers and the deeper issues of the life they lead. (The other type is basically GI Joe and Sgt. Rock in space and may be ignored with no loss.) Probably the two most influential military sf novels of the past half-century -- and the rest o which all the others are automatically compared -- are Robert Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_ and Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ (written specifically as a response to Heinlein). I'm pleased to say that Scalzi's first novel jumps him right up into that rarified company. It's several centuries in the future and Earth has become something of a backwater (which may be an explanation for the fact that the small-town American Midwest seems not to have changed a bit . . .). The Colonies are where the action is -- but Americans aren't allowed to emigrate to them, only (apparently) South Asians. Well, the U.S. tried to destroy India and its neighbors in a nuclear war, so that's only fair. But if you really want to leave, you can always enlist in the Colonial Defense Forces -- once you reach the age of seventy-five. The CDF will transfer your consciousness into a heavily modified clone of the young you, complete with SmartBlood and a BrainPal, and they'll give you an extremely intelligent rifle and teach you to use it to kill all the alien species who are in competition with humanity for lebensraum. John Perry is such an enlistee, a recent widower with no reason to stick around and get even older. Though his opinions about war are equivocal, he turns out to have an unexpected talent for it. The casualty rate is quite high in the CDF but Perry not only survives, he becomes something a hero as well as an officer. Even more, he runs into a Special Forces lieutenant created from the DNA of his late wife, though the six-year-old personality inhabiting the body is decidedly not her. Scalzi has a genius for dialogue of the dryly witty sort and he avoids all the clich&eacute;s of the less readable type of military sf. There's a sort of sequel out now and I'll be looking for it.a genius for dialogue of the dryly witty sort and he avoids all the clich&eacute;s of the less readable type of military sf.

B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor's voice is in excellent form on his Christmas CD entitled James Taylor At Christmas. The CD boasts an excellent collage of traditional and somewhat formal holiday hymns interspersed with more playful, upbeat pop numbers. The ultimate effect is sheer delight to almost anyone's ears; and just one listen to this CD will prove it.<br /><br />The CD starts off beautifully with a playful and heartfelt rendition of \\"Winter Wonderland.\\" Chris Botti plays the trumpet on this song, too. This secular music is quickly followed by the more religious \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain.\\"<br /><br />Some other songs celebrating the joy of the holiday season include a pleasing and laid-back duet for James Taylor and Natalie Cole on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside;\\" \\"Jingle Bells\\" onto which James Taylor puts his own stamp using a unique arrangement; \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" and \\"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)\\" written by Mel Torm&eacute; and Robert Wells. Toots Theilemans does a great job on harmonica for \\"The Christmas Song,\\" too.<br /><br />\\"In The Bleak Midwinter\\" is a much more religious song with a lush musical arrangement; James Taylor addresses the importance of loving Jesus as Jesus loves everyone. \\"Who Comes This Night\\" is based on the nativity scene in the manger and it is equally charming.<br /><br />The CD ends with the thoughtful \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\" The musical arrangement is flawless and this is the perfect song to end this CD.<br /><br />The liner notes are beautiful. There are two great photos of James Taylor and the song credits are there, too.<br /><br />In addition, there is the issue of the differences between the three \\"versions\\" of this CD. This CD is, for the most part, a re-issue of James Taylor's 2004 Christmas CD put out by Hallmark. There is the 2004 Hallmark version which is now difficult but not impossible to obtain. The 2004 CD has the song \\"Deck The Halls.\\" On the other hand, this 2006 Christmas CD has the songs \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"River,\\" a song about escaping from the holiday crunch-rush. There is, believe it or not, a third version of this album that does have \\"Deck The Halls\\" as a bonus track. I agree with the reviewer who writes that this third edition WOULD be the definitive James Taylor Christmas CD. If you can't find the version that includes \\"Deck The Halls,\\" I suggest this CD as a solid alternative.<br /><br />There may be three versions of this CD; but James Taylor surely put his heart and soul into every song on all three CDs. All technicalities aside, you can't go wrong with this CD. It still boasts excellent sound quality, great cover art all its own, a wide range of Christmastime songs and excellent contributions by Natalie Cole, Chris Botti and Toots Theilemans.

B000HCO83Q|1.0|I enjoyed the first X-Men movie not only because it was so thrilling to see a live-action adaptation of a cherished comic book series, but also because it had a plot that made sense and it didn't go (too), over-the-top.  The sequel, X-Men 2, was still very enjoyable because the plot was consistent to the end and the action sequences were not as overdone as MI:2.  X-Men 3 was THOROUGHLY dissapointing for me because it tried so hard to pack in everything it could, to the detriment of the plot.  I found myself wondering why this series of mismatched scenes were jumbled together when there should have been a very solid plotline to follow.  Were we to focus on Jean Gray?  Archangel?  Magneto?  What was the movie about other than an excuse to go WAY over-the-top on every sequence and barely work on character development.  What a pity the last movie was so thrown together.

B000IMV4IW|4.0|Yes its a great cd crammed full of great tunes but where is \\"Do you know what i mean\\" ( a number one and Oasis highlight). I know Noel hates Be Here Now (not a good album for sure but this song was a monster. Not a single track from this third album made it on the cd) Theres plenty of Top 5 and number ones that also didnt make it but this one songs omission is to me unbelievable. Oh well- as other reviewers have said its all good stuff but those looking to get all the essential Oasis will have to wait for a boxset or a later compilation- ps the japan issue adds \\"roll with it\\" and \\"let there be love\\" but still no \\"know what i mean\\".

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Along with the Amazonian rainforest, there can be few natural resources which have been ransacked like the Beatles back catalogue. Anthologised, lobotomised, and generally pillaged in the pursuit of commercial gain, public demand appeared to have finally exhausted itself with the middling response to 2003's unfortunately titled \\"Let It Be... Naked\\".    Until now. Prompted by a long-term friendship between George Harrison and Cirque De Soleil's founder Guy Laliberté, and given the blessing of the Axis Powers (Paul, Ringo and Yoko), Love is the latest addition to that bulging catalogue.     Essentially the soundtrack to the Cirque show launched in Las Vegas last July, \\"Love\\" is a jaw-dropping 80- minute mash-up of The Beatles' more accessible tunes, slavishly compiled by Giles Martin and overseen by father George, all delivered in sumptuous 5.1 surround sound.    Those fearing a train-wreck along the lines of Twin Freaks - The Freelance Hellraiser's remix assault on the Wings back catalogue - can rest easy.     Starting off with \\"Because\\", it segues into the drum solo from \\"The End\\", hammers into the opening riff from \\"Hard Day's Night\\" and then lurches straight into \\"Get Back\\"  before you can splutter \\"Stars On 45\\".     From there it's a musical landslide of Beatleology ( \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"A Day In The Life\\", \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" ), all overlaid with snippets from every nook and cranny of their back catalogue.    So we get \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" as one continuous ebb'n'flow of mid-period drugginess, \\"Come Together/Dear Prudence\\" as an acid-fried soundscape and - best of all - the cosmic drones of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\" fitted together like a glove.     Wherever a song is allowed to stand alone (\\"Back In The USSR\\", \\"Revolution\\"), it arrives with double-tracked vocals, stripped back instrumentation or - why not? - the faint tinge of sitar.     If the scale is almost beyond comprehension, \\"Love\\" also represents a sonic DaVinci Code for Beatles trainspotters, who could spend the rest of their lives arguing over whether the snare sound is derived from \\"No Reply\\" or \\"Paperback Writer\\".     Completists will enjoy a newly unearthed demo version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", but it is the Martins' obsessive quest for innovation which deserves the garlands.        Paul Moody   [...]
B000HIVQK8|5.0|This is my favorite Harrison album,yes I prefer it over All Things Must Pass which is a wonderful album but can seem dense in spots.The addition of the 'b'sides really help the remaster of Living in the Material World,especially Deep Blue now I don't have to dig up my old 45 to hear that tune! Material World is fresh with some great tunes and let's not forget Georges slide work.Crisp and fresh would be the tone of this disc
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Well this cd is sure to make a purist mad and raise questions among fans for sure. Simply put this is the beatles modernized into a pyschedlic mishmash collage of many of their finest moments. Soundwise its fantastic-the editing and tracklisting are excellent and the sacred originals have only been altered via the original tracks(read the liner notes this isnt really a radical remix as some have said the tracks are all tracks of the original members)- only a string section was added to while my guitar gently weeps which wasnt original. In my eyes (and ears)this is fantastic and is one of the best listening experiences i have heard. Ofcourse the orignal songs and albums are great but this is fresh sounding and the experiments almost all work amazingly. In the wrong hands this could have been a disaster but Giles Martin has achieved one of the most successful reworkings of a catalog that i could ever remember. For an eighty minute sonic tour of the beatles genius i think this succeeds on all levels. for me this is a dream come true.

0060934913|4.0|Anthony Bourdain emphatically has a problem with kitchen personnel who call in sick, especially vegetarian ones \\"brought down by any rumor of a cold.\\" But I suspect that vegetarians, being health-conscious virtually by definition, are simply putting their own well-being ahead of the momentary staffing needs of their employers. Which policy would their customers prefer? We can guess at Bourdain's choice: the open sore on Chaucer's Canterbury cook. It should also be pointed out that vegetarians, being thinkers again virtually by definition, are probably less inclined to live from paycheck to paycheck, and therefore have the financial wherewithal to call in sick when they are sick, instead of coming to work coughing and sneezing all over the food because their world would fall apart if they missed an hour's pay.     Bourdain also has a problem in general with vegetarians, especially vegans, both of whom are \\"the enemy of everything that is good and decent in the human spirit, an affront to everything I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food.\\" (He once described a vegetarian meal he had in Berkeley as \\"soul destroying.\\") Even allowing for comic provocation, his view is really astonishing. For starters, it's the exact logical opposite of moral truth. People simply cannot be criticized for not unnecessarily killing and eating animals in their daily life. But it is also illogical in Bourdain's own stated world-view: that people should be open to other cultural norms. Well, what of the vegetarian cultural norm, as found, for example, in Berkeley?     Bourdain writes of his daily need for (among other horrors) veal broth. I suggest readers do a little research on how veal is made. It's not exactly soul enhancing. Vegetarians are affected by such matters, and for this sin they are comically damned (along with many others) in this comical book.
B000092T6M|4.0|Alright, I'm not going to go crazy and write a long drippy review about this movie, but I will say that this was one of about three movies that I would watch over and over again throughout my childhood. I first saw it at around 7 yrs. old i think, and I loved the specific feel to it, the way you can just escape to this period and experience it like you are there. The cast is great.. Morgan Freeman is amazing as always etc.. and Kevin Costner is... well, Kevin Costner. Reading other reviews, especially by historians, critics seem to hate how he doesn't really played the part he should have, for one thing, at least try to have an accent, but I think his American accent and attitude in the movie really made  me like it even more, because it really is one of a kind when looking at other medieval-based movies. It's over-the-top, glaringly inaccurate, and I love it for exactly what it is! Remember like-minded history buffs: don't expect this to be rigidly framed to the actual legend. It's just a great action film.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Well, I've read enough to know that the science presented in \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" is correct. The telling statistic in the movie: no climate scientists dispute the evidence that the cause of global warming is man-made, but over 50% of media reports express doubts. So corporate media--filled with ads from oil companies--isn't clarifying the debate, but instead plants seeds of doubt in the public mind.<br /><br />Reading the one-star reviews on this web page reveals consistent parroting of right-wing talking points that politicize truth into science fiction. The ignorance is stunning.<br /><br />As to the complaint that there's too much Al Gore in this film, I'll just allow myself to disagree. The guy's been tarred relentlessly by his political adversaries. He never claimed he invented the Internet, you pinheads! That was a misquote published in a newspaper that never got adequately retracted. It's again a punchline used to avoid the real issue of the science presented in the documentary.<br /><br />Gore's a really decent man, and the inclusion of his personal journey and why he came to care so deeply about this issue is absolutely relevant. It actually depoliticizes his 'motives' for presenting his slide show.<br /><br />People also forget that the reasons there wasn't more done during the Clinton/Gore administration is that the so-called conservative right had just taken charge of Congress and wouldn't dream of enacting any legislation like this. Clinton/Gore never presented Kyoto for a vote because it would never have been approved by the Republicans.<br /><br />But all the blather misses the point. There will always be people who continue to claim that cigarettes don't cause cancer, that seat belts don't save lives, and that people don't affect the climate.<br /><br />The Catholic Church only pardoned Galileo in 1992, okay? Bad ideas are often hard to get rid of. Oil companies are super rich and get what they pay for: lies in the press and stooges in Congress.<br /><br />Get this movie. Watch it.

Classico is funny but really short, and the whole Devil loves Metal track is pretty good. Other than that the whole cd is like snippets of sound that aren't even songs.

B000I5X80G|5.0|This is definetly 5 star material here. Young and Crazy Horse just simply sound terrific. Some of the songs clock in at over 10 minutes but there are no tedious moments. None of it sounds dated at all. The guitar interplay between Young and Danny Whitten is simply amazing. BUT a lot more music could have been put on here. How about some from Young's earlier acoustic set? Or some more electric? Borders wants $18.99 plus tax for this. That's a pretty steep price for under 50 minutes of music. When the CD ends you want more; it's that good!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Credits: George Harrison and Guy Laliberte for the concept, Paul, Ringo, Yoko and Olivia for sanctioning the production and especially the 5th Beatle genius of Sir George Martin and is son for brining a fresh interpretation to the most treasured music of the past 50 years. The task of selecting what to include in this amazingly inventive production would have been daunting to anyone other than Sir George.  His intimacy with every detail of the recording sessions and production provides us with a gift none of us ever could have expected. We should all give thanks that he was able to stay with us long enough to produce such a masterpiece. Avid Beatles fans have had these songs floating around in their minds as lifelong soundtracks for decades sometimes out of sequence and sometimes just snippets kicked off in our heads by a word, a look or a feeling. \\"Love\\" is alarming at times because your instinctual expectations are turned upside down by new treatments and arrangements and it all works wondrously. We get a nice through-the-looking-glass view into the world of Beatles and their producer. If this is how George Martin conceives such a mixture who would be foolish enough to argue? My only request of Sir George and his son Giles is that they provide and extensive interview relating how they tackled what to include, how they selected the numerous snippets involved and how they sequenced the finished product. John Lennon used to ask his mates \\"Where are we going boys?\\" And the response was \\"To the toppermost of the poppermost\\". They made it all right and they remain the only occupants of that lofty realm.
B000HBK1YW|4.0|This 2-disc set has been remastered very well and has never sounded better and certainly calling it jazz/rock does not quite do it justice. It's been hailed as a leading representative of the Jazz Fusion genre and I guess that'll have to do for want of a better description.<br /><br />The music here is meant to shock and to force a rethink on what music and improvisation specifically is all about. In that sense, it closely resembles avant garde and modern art. Just like modern art, this album is designed to force a response either positive or negative from its audience and in that sense, it succeeds very well.<br /><br />The material in Disc 2 is a little more assessable and more closely resembling jazz as one thinks of it in the main while disc 1 for some reason reminds me of the soundtrack of the first \\"Dirty Harry\\" movie whenever the villain gets centrestage.<br /><br />An album that grows on you and seems to get better each time you listen to it, it has inspired and influenced countless other jazz fusion artists and so is very important in the overall history of music let alone the jazz genre in itself.<br /><br />This version of the album is also a real treat for fans as the mini-lp gatefold replical sleeve is a work of art.  Essential listening and a worthy addition to any music-lover's collection. Recommended but expect to be shocked, surprised and to move out of your musical comfort zone for about 90 minutes.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|I loved the Aeon Flux animation in HS.  I would watch them over and over (mostly because MTV would reply stuff constantly) and it never got boring, there was always some new detail to take note of. <br /> <br />This movie might be a good movie on its own.  But it is not representative of Aeon Flux's world at all.  It draws only the tiniest bit upon this amazing and endlessly creative world that was the original animation.  I was very disappointed by this movie.  It was flat and horrible if you're familiar with the animation series.
1401200605|2.0|There was a lot of hype surrounding this series for the lead up to its release, so its difficult to compare the result to its expectation. Technically there is nothing wrong with this trade paperback collection of the first half of the Hush story-arc. Jim Lee's artwork is slick and dynamic, the inking is crisp, the coloring is lush and vivid. The action sequences are fun and the characters are rendered with the fantastic musculature and big-breasted look typical of super-hero fare. Jim Lee does a great pin-up and you can tell he puts a lot of love into what he does. <br />But sadly the whole comic (both trade volumes) reek of heavy marketing and editorial imput at the expense of a good yarn. Big Villains and Big heroes pull customers, so DC whipped out most of its big names in a typical 'event' storyline without much overall logic of story-telling subtlety. Jeph Loeb did it twice with the Long Halloween and Dark Victory, and those were great series (and great tpbs, check them out), but here he's take out all of the nuanced writing and replaced it with management gimmicks. Its not really his fault, he has a lot of bosses to answer to.  <br />Its all like the hollywood blockbuster starring and directed by the current who's who from the celebrity gossip pages. The production values are top-notch but you end up leaving with a bad taste in your mouth and a sense of guilt that your money will be used to produce more along these lines.  <br />I wanted to enjoy this series, and I gave it a go since I've been keen to see what the Batman franchise has been up to in recent years. However, it is glossy and slick to cover up the fact that story doesn't really matter as much as sales numbers. This is the typical big-house outlook that really pulls in the cash but produces a lot of eye-candy junk.  <br />These sorts of 'events' books really offer nothing and deliver nothing to the genre and aren't worth your time except if you're a Batman/DC worshipper. <br />'War Games' is a muchbetter recent batman arc.  <br />Skip this one.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|It's hard to believe that its been more then ten years now since Tupac Shakur died. I have been a fan of his music since \\"[[ASIN:B000005Z0E 2Pacalypse Now]]\\", whether it be classic Pac material, post-death material, remixes or rare unreleased music - I have always wanted to hear it. Watching movies like \\"[[ASIN:B0000DZ3GK Resurrection]]\\" gave me some more insight into what the man was really like and where he came from. Pac's music has touched million's of people worldwide, and will continue you do so for a long time to come.     Tupac Amaru Shakur - (June 16th 1971 - September 13th 1996) R.I.P.     \\"Pac's Life\\" (2006) is the sixth post-death studio album and has numerous guest appearances from Krayzie Bone, Ashanti, T.I., Hussein Fatal, Papoose, Carl Thomas, Keyshia Cole, A3, Jay Rock, Young Buck, Chamillionaire, Nipsy Hussle, Young Dre, Lil Scrappy, Nutso, Yaki Kadafi (R.I.P.), Stormy, Ludacris, Keon Bryce, Big Syke, E.D.I., Young Noble, Snoop Dogg, Chris Starr, Gravy. Having heard some of the original unreleased material, which was used for this album, I can agree with the reviewer who would of liked to have seen it be released as is. A good example of that would be the unreleased original cut \\"Play Your Cards Right\\" which has Pac and KC & Jojo delivering a very memorable track. Another misstep is having the \\"Dear Mama\\" (Bonus Remix) appear on only the UK version of this release. Anthony Hamiliton appears on this exceptional remix, of one of the all time great 2pac cuts. \\"Soon As I Get Home\\" is the most authentic, unaltered Pac track on the new album. The addition of singer Keon Bryce and Ludacris on the male version of \\"Play Your Cards Right\\" works well, Ashanti and T.I.'s inclusion on \\"Pac's Life\\" is not bad either. I find some of the production, beats and guest appearances on other tracks to be lackluster or not fitting. I don't feel like \\"Pac's Life\\" measures up to do some of the other post-death album's, all the same I can understand the material being moreand more limited.
0618680004|1.0|Mr. Dawkins attacks religion by assuming that all of it is like Fundamentalist Christianity/Islam. He shows no philisophical depth in the finer points of Buddhist/Hindu metaphysics, or any of the myriad belief systems that exist in the world. He also doesn't understand the cultural value that religion had in the evolution of thought itself.
0316166685|5.0|While struggling with my own issues surrounding God and heaven and whether or not there is an afterlife, I stumbled onto this incredible book. I had purchased Ms. sebold's other book, an autobiography about her own rape and how \\"Lucky\\" she was to be alive, at a library book sale. I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" in one day. It is so much more than a book about rape. It is inspiring. Please read this book, it may change your attitude about death and heaven and most of all,life.
015603008X|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Flowers for Algernon\\". I've never read a story with this plot and had no idea what was going to happen at the end.<br /><br />Well written. I like how the author in a subtle way had Charlie's writing and dictating improve as he got smarter.<br /><br />I like how as Charlie learned about himself by the end of the book. That is knowledge I don't think he will lose.
B0000033WC|5.0|The alternate version of the album is a gem - more personal, intimate and quirky than the original.<br /><br />Amongst the rest (ie  the \\"bonus tracks\\") are 2 superb versions of Ocean, his best version of Satellie of Love, and the magnificent demo Love Makes You Feel Ten Feet Tall which contains elements of at least two later songs - have fun identifying them!
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|2006 has been a great year for Black Metal. Incredible (and accessible) CDs from Venom, Cradel of Filth, Dissection (RIP Jon), Satyricon, Carpathian Forrest, Celtic Frost, Enslaved, and now I. This offshoot from the ashes of Immortal more recalls Moterhead with more \\"guteral\\" vocals, plus a creativity usually not associated with this sub genre (at least not till this year). Those who enjoyed the Dimmu Borger side project Chrome Division should deffenatly seak out \\"Between Two Worlds\\".
B000002KIK|3.0|The last album that Ozzy did with the Sabs is one of the better ones, in my opinion.  \\"Never Say Die\\" has some really schorchin' tunes to offer.  Athough it is not one of the best it is considerably better than \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" which was thier previous album.  \\"Never Say Die\\" was the 8th and last album with Ozzy.  It was released in 1978 and Black Sabbath was not so much into expieramentation as they were with \\"Technical...\\"  The sound of the album has a great feel and somewhat goes back to the old heaviness that we all love Sabbath for.  The songs are well executed and very catchy unlike 1976's \\"Technical Ecstasy\\".  Ozzy sounds great on this record.  His voice, at the time, was sorely underrated by critics.  Tony Iommi's songwriting for this album was as diverse as it was new and recognizable.  Some stand out tracks are \\"Never Say Die, Johnny Blade, Hard Road, Shockwave, and \\"Swinging the Chain\\", which Bill Ward does vocals on so, that in itself is different.  \\"Johnny Blade\\" is one of the best tunes that Sabbath has ever written.  If you have'nt heard it by now, you are a loser!  \\"Johnny Blade\\" rocks!!!  As new and diverse as this album is, it still comes back with that old Sabbath feel.  This is a definite must-have in any real heavy metal cd collection.
076790592X|5.0|this book is a great reminder of a something that we all already now, but from time to time need to be reminded of. i have read several of this author's other books, and with every single one i have difficulty putting it down. the author's style of writing has an amazing way of grabbing the reader's attention and not letting go until the book is finished, only to leave you thinking about what you've just read.
B00004RJDA|4.0|I really don't want to like this movie,  but I do.   Unfortunately,   the things I like about it have nothing to do with the Julia Roberts character,   who can be so obnoxious that I wonder WHY William loves her so much.   She has a few moments of sweetness,  but the rest of the time she is acting ridiculous or downright unstable.   She is rude when he bends over backward to help her after the orange juice spill,  she puts him through the ridiculous charade of having to act like a journalist when he visits her at her hotel,  she invites him up to her room despite having a boyfriend,  then goes beserk on him after they sleep together when she flees to his home to escape the paparazzi.   I mean,  what kind of idiot hides from the press at a private home,  then goes to open the door herself because she wants to know \\"What he's up to\\"?    She's so stupid she deserves to be found out hiding at his house.   Of course,  then she goes ballistic on him,   and runs out of his life after blaming the whole situation on him.  I was actually pleased when he initially refuses to resume their relationship when she comes to see him at his shop a year later.  One puts up with the obnoxious Anna Scott because Julia Roberts is so believeable,  and so enjoyable to watch,  but seriously,   why would anyone go so crazy over such an unappealing person?  <br />     Most of what makes this movie good are the other characters.   Hugh Grant basically plays the same character in every movie,  the stammering,  awkward,  bumbling but adorable nice guy.   You can't help but like him,  and his William is such a decent man I feel he deserves far better than the neurotic Anna.   The characters around William make this movie worth watching,  and if I were Anna,  I'd stick with William just to be with them.   Spike is hilarious,  stealing every scene.  Honey,  Bella,  Max,  Bernie....just wonderful.   They make this movie sweet,  enjoyable,   and worth watching over and over again,  even if I am puzzled as to why William wastes time pining for Anna.   The music is great,  and the scene in the marketplace over a year's time is inspired.   All in all,  there are enough good points in this movie to make it worth your while,  despite the bratty American movie star.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This album is a true masterwork. Produced over many months by veteran producer George Martin and his son Giles, this album - especially in the 5.1 DVD-Audio format - reveals both the sheer quality of recording and performance of the original multitrack recordings, and the enormous possibilities of the modern digital recording studio in the hands of true masters of the craft.  <br /> <br />Many of the original multitrack masters had a multitude of instruments crammed on to just a few tracks: disentangling them to permit the remixes present on this disc must have taken weeks on its own. Yet here you will find elements from the original songs presented more clearly than ever before, alongside elements lifted from other songs and spun in forwards, backwards and sideways. You'll hear things clearly you could never quite hear before, and some things you simply never knew existed.  <br /> <br />Tracks from the early days feature quite traditional mixes while later, more psychedelic offerings are brim full of interesting little features that repay multiple listening, especially in surround. The audio quality is, quite simply, stunning: the DVD-Audio surround content is at 24-bit, 96kHz, which means, essentially, that you're hearing the masters as they were heard by the Martins at Abbey Road when they played them back - no other audio system can offer this. Even the CD is excellent, with none of the over-compression so prevalent on modern recordings.  <br /> <br />There is only one new piece of recording here - a poignant new string arrangement for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" recorded at Air - every other sound you hear is from the original mulitracks. The 26-track album is a more or less continuous segue of songs, some including transitions that contain elements from several different numbers, with a natural flow, development and conclusion.  <br /> <br />Yes, it's the soundtrack to a show; yes, you have literally heard it all (almost) before; but in another way no, youhave never heard this before - and you should take a listen. Congratulations to everyone concerned.  <br /> <br />Be sure to buy the DVD version if you have a halfway-decent surround system (especially a DVD-Audio player, though any DVD player will play this disc in surround or stereo), though the CD sounds fine  - and leave your preconceptions at the door.
0060090383|5.0|I love Marian Keyes' books,  and \\"Rachel's Holiday\\"  is one of her best.  To start out at the begining of Rachel's journey into rehab,  when she hilariously explains why she couldn't possibly be a drug addict,  and to follow her through her journey of denial,  pain,  and rebirth,  is one of the most satisfying reading experiences I've had in my VERY long reading career.      Review after review of Keyes' books put her into the \\"Chick-Lit\\" category,  but that does her such a disservice,  as her wit and insightful take on her characters put her light years ahead of the average author.    All of her main characters are so multi-dimensional that you can't help but identify,  just a bit,  with some feature of them all.   I've never done drugs,  and am not even a social drinker,  but I was still able to relate to some of Rachel's thought processes as she is forced to confront the truth of her life and of her coping mechanisms.    Rachel is so smart and so funny,  and yet Keyes easily portrays the less attractive aspects of her personality without making her any less sympathetic.   In the end,  as Rachel starts to confront some hard truths about herself and her life,  you feel a little of her triumph as she moves toward recovery.   The other characters in the book are enjoyable too,   like Luke...every woman should have a Luke in her life,  and we feel the pain of Rachel's only being able to appreciate him once he's gone.   One of my only criticisms of Keyes other books is that the best friend characters end up being a little interchangeable,  but Brigit is believeable as Rachel's fed up roommate.    Rachel's fellow addicts at the Cloisters could be caricatures,  but Keyes is able to make each one real and poignant in his or her own way.     If you've ever avoided Marian Keyes because you think she is just another chick-lit author,   give her a chance,  she is so much smarter and so much deeper than that,  and each of her main characters takes an emotional journey that isso much more satisfying than just finding \\"true love.\\"     \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" is one of the greatest examples of this.

B000004712|5.0|Herbie Hancock's body of excellent work is vast but this 1996 CD is one of his more interesting latter day recordings. It's also one of my favourites. On it, he is joined by some of my most favourite players; Michael Brecker on tenor and soprano saxophones, John Scofield on guitar, Dave Holland on acoustic bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums and electric percussion and Don Alias on percussion.<br /><br />The idea is a great one - take current popular songs and make new jazz standards out of them. The idea of making jazz versions of pop tunes is not new of course but while other so-called jazz musicians have just remade the originals of their choice, lazily replacing the vocal phrases with their instruments, Hancock has done the job the way it's supposed to be done. He's considered the tunes very carefully and then, together with Bob Belden, given them new and exciting arrangements. Produced by Hancock and Guy Eckstine, the album tackles tunes from Don Henley, Peter Gabriel, The Beatles, Babyface, Sade, Simon & Garfunkel, Prince, Nirvana and Steely Dan.<br /><br />It's great stuff. I particularly love the way Hancock would phrase the end of a solo, only to have that phrase echoed by Scofield at the beginning of his. They do that on two of my favourite songs - the opening \\"New York Minute\\" and \\"Love Is Stronger Than Pride\\". The ballad \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is pure magic. The way John Scofield plays on it blows my mind every time I listen. \\"Thieves In The Temple\\" and \\"When Can I See You\\" (where Don Alias really shines) are also particularly interesting.<br /><br />But I love all the songs really. Just as you think the album is about to end on a quiet note via \\"All Apologies\\" and the Herbie Hancock and Jean Hancock original \\"Manhattan\\", in comes the stomper \\"Your Gold Teeth II\\" to pick things up again.<br /><br />I had quite a few of the original songs before I heard this album and those I didn't have I went and searched out after I'd heard it. I feel Herbie Hancock has managed, (with the exception, maybe, of the Nirvana tune - nobody and nothing, in my view, can beat the haunted and haunting sound of Kurt Cobain's voice), that very rare feat of making covers of songs sound much more interesting than the originals. Some of his more recent outings have been a bit ropey in my view (though, admittedly, very popular) but there's no doubt in my mind that he's one of the musical geniuses of this generation. If ever any proof was needed, this album with its all-star cast, is it.the Nirvana tune - nobody and nothing, in my view, can beat the haunted and haunting sound of Kurt Cobain's voice), that very rare feat of making covers of songs sound much more interesting than the originals.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|Giant pharmaceutical companies come under scrutiny - some might say attack - in this fast moving political thriller based on the novel by John le Carre. I remember seeing a number of documentaries round about the time this movie was released in cinemas, that questioned the motives and methods of \\"Big Pharma\\", particularly in the way they work in third world countries. I remember one documentary in particular looking at one company that was testing drugs on children in northern Nigeria, usually the children of illiterate parents, by promising them cures and getting them to sign consent forms that they couldn't read. In that context, this movie seems to know exactly what it's talking about, hitting the nail squarely on the head.<br /><br />The phenomenal \\"City of God\\" director Fernando Meirelles (who showed us the slums of Rio de Janeiro in a completely new light) brings his distinctive visual style to a very exciting story, filmed in Kenya, with twists and turns I could never have seen coming in a million years. Activist Tessa Quayle (played by Rachel Weisz) is murdered and her diplomat husband Justin (played by Ralph Fiennes), who up until that point seems rather hesitant when it came to local affairs, becomes suspicious that she was killed because of what she knew and what she could do with that information and becomes determined to get to the bottom of what led up to her getting killed. He gets right stuck in with no thought of risk to himself.<br /><br />The story unfolds in a series of flashbacks and while it is said that le Carre novels are notoriously difficult to adapt, Meirelles handles the material superbly, knowing what subplots to keep and which to discard. Even so, it is not an easy plot to follow is not for the faint-hearted. It requires complete concentration but the final result is an edge of your seat thrill and I'm so glad I got this on DVD. I know I'm going to want to watch it again soon and again later. By the way, Weisz won a well-deserved supporting actress Oscar for her role in the movie.<br /><br />The DVD extras offer you deleted scenes, extended scenes, a mini-documentary \\"Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya, another one called \\"John le Carre: From Page To The Screen, and Anatomy of A Global Thriller: Behind The Scenes of \\"The Constant Gardener\\".pporting actress Oscar for her role in the movie.  <br /> <br />The DVD extras offer you deleted scenes, extended scenes, a mini-documentary \\"Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya, another one called \\"John le Carre: From Page To The Screen, and Anatomy of A Global Thriller: Behind The Scenes of \\"The Constant Gardener\\". <br /> <br /> <br />
0743298020|5.0|I don't get a chance to say this as often as I'd like, but `The Thirteenth Tale' is easily the best story I've read in quite a while. I utilized the word `story' as opposed to `book' because many books simply don't tell a meaningful, moving, and complete tale as well as this Diane Setterfield debut. From beginning to end, it moves evenly along with descriptive and colorful characters in ever entwining and perplexing situations, yet written in interesting and understandable prose. It took a little time getting used to the sudden changes in grammatical first person narration, though it became effortless once realized.<br /><br />`The Thirteenth Tale' is a mysterious and ghostly story of mortal existence, family skeletons, and the grief suffered from life's trying disappointments and unfortunate fate. It's a story of love and personal closure. It's an intricate story of twins. But most of all ... it's a puzzle.<br /><br />Margaret Lea, a young writer whose father is the owner of a small book store, is asked by an aging author to write her biography. She's summoned to the house of the famous yet sickly author, Vida Winter, to hear her story told slowly and delicately. The past is brought to life, yet Margaret is constantly left to read between the lines and decipher the mystery for herself. Vida tests her wits and psychological framework by supplying her with only pieces of the puzzle, while insistent upon hearing her story as well. Margaret was chosen for a reason.<br /><br />After all, everyone has a story.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the reading public is puzzled by the fact that Vida's collection of stories is missing the thirteenth tale. However, Vida is quite aware of the existence of her final, yet most magnificent story of all.<br /><br />In fine British prose, by an author who is blatantly in love with the works of Emily Bronte, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austen, and who appears to be following down that virtuous novelist path herself, `The Thirteenth Tale' is a heartwarming and melancholy story of truth brought to the surface. I enjoyed it immensely.truth brought to the surface. I enjoyed it immensely.
0553062182|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book. First of all, I do believe that the HSP trait is a distinguishable trait. I myself have started to discover and do some research into the subject. I have no doubt that Dr. Elaine Aron is an HSP herself and her book has helped many. Maybe I was born too late or something or just my natural tendency to not put too much value into self-help books in general. Maybe it's a GenX thing, I don't know... but I think the root of it may be my general disdain for the psych \\"establishment\\" as it exists right now. They have pretentions of \\"open mindedness\\" but I really do believe a great majority of them have this \\"happy psychologically well-rounded medium\\" that they ALL seem to want to drive people toward, regardless of how many paths there are up that mountain to get to that point. I fear Ms. Aron, with her PhD credentials, has fallen into this trap of not being able to think outside the \\"psych box\\", so to speak. My biggest complaints about this book are:  <br />1. her dismissal of the word \\"shy\\" and \\"shyness in general\\". (see below) <br />2. her over-insistance on psychotherapy as the cure of everything.  <br />3, her over-reliance on childhood experiences as the ultimate factor in just about everything related to HSPness. A side note to this complaint is she seems to think childhood experience is at one of two extremes: either blissfully wonderful and magical in every way or horribly dysfunctional and wracked with trauma and just plain awful in every which way (of course requiring years of psychotherapy to get over!--sorry, I can't help being sarcastic!). I would think that most people's childhoods, whether they are HSP or not, would fall somewhere in middle, don't you think? That would be where mine falls.  <br />4. Generational and socioeconomic complaints: This book, like many other self-help books of this type seem always geared toward overly-affluent suburban Baby Boomers. As a struggling GenXer male who hasn't had a six-figure income to escape from and find out that life is more important than making money, (sorry, sarcasm is too ingrained...it's a GenX thing!)I just feel so disconnected to this type of thinking that prevails in most self-help books of this type (which is why I mostly avoid them!) Aren't there HSPs who AREN'T age 45-60 females from New York or San Francisco?(where this author divides her time) out there who have a perspective to say? (Hmmm, maybe I should write it myself!) <br /> <br />I'll address these complaints briefly in depth. As someone who has both been called \\"shy\\" and have called myself that for as long as I can remember, I have no problem with the label. Granted, we should not let our labels BECOME us, but if there's something that fits and is not derogatory, why not? Frankly, what's wrong with \\"shy\\", Ms. Aron? I respect your view on it, but I disagree. I don't think \\"shy\\" is an inherently negative description. I'm mystified as to why you think every introvert should shed it.  <br /> <br />I guess I wish this book had been written by an HSP layperson instead of a clinical psychotherapist who is stuck inside the box of that school of thought. That would make it seem more like it was written by a friend and not a shrink who has to keep their occupational distance from you. This is a highly emotional (and sensitive!) subject for us HSPers, so I dunno...maybe my response is just a natural reaction of my type. Who knows? Psychology is an inexact science to begin with, anyway. <br /> <br />So basically, it was a frustrating disappointment to read this book. I'm giving it two stars only because it at least was groundbreaking in it was apparently the first book to try to identify and distiguish this specific trait. It deserves credit for that at least.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I haven't played any of the Silent Hill games and probably won't but this film sure left me wishing I had more time on my hands so that I could.  This film works on a lot of different levels and you have to go back through it in your mind before you realize that the story does work and make sense.  ALL of the actors are very strong in their roles - solid acting all the way around.<br /><br />The feel of the town of Silent Hill reminded me of what I was feeling when I read HP Lovecraft's \\"The Shadow Out of Innsmouth\\".<br /><br />The costumes are so effective it becomes very hard to discern the line between live-action and CGI effects.<br /><br />One warning - much of the imagery is very nightmarish and disturbing - but it isn't really gore - can you get your head aound that?  It's like being dropped square in the middle of a Hieronymus Bosch painting that has come to life.<br /><br />Excellent, haunting and disturbing.<br /><br />Follow-up:  Just watched Silent Hill a second time.  In some respects it was even better because I could focus on the incredible imagery instead of trying to follow the story and plotline.  The acting, the sets, the effects, and the music score are pretty close to perfection.  Silent Hill definitely raises the bar for excellence in the horror film genre.  This is an intense work of art.  If I had any criticism it would be that the sound did not transfer well in a couple of places where Dahlia is speaking.  BUY NOW!
B000I5X81K|5.0|As with most CD's I've purchased I have my favorite songs at first but they change with repeated play time and or mood. This doesn't have to be your \\"Favorite\\" but it is still a fine effort by Josh. Since I enjoy various styles and types of music I'm glad he is trying to change up his sound. He is a young man and will be around a long time so why should he get bored with his \\"sound\\" .
B00005JPCD|4.0|I thought this movie was very interesting.  The messages were well placed and the music was great.  I felt the message about the environment was possibly too much for children, but I think this movie was really good overall.
B0000214F1|2.0|The version I saw lasted one and a half hours. I guess it must have been seriously chopped down: the blurry scenes suddenly seemed to stop, and then moved on to something completely different. I was reminded of Monty Python. Well, the scenes weren't all that different, just more of the same. Porn is designed to arouse. There was nothing whatsoever arousing about this, and none of the participants seemed particularly aroused either. However, it had something, so I give it an extra star, but I don't know what it was. The wreck of a possibility, I suppose. Very good, stellar cast. O'Toole, Gielgud, McDowell, Mirren are all great actors. The constant puzzle was: What on earth were they doing in this crazy and chaotic mess? Just earning a crust? They all looked a bit puzzled themselves: like, what am I doing here? One did get some kind of a feel of how it must have been to be absolute ruler of the entire known world, to have everyone obey one's slightest whim (another question I kept asking myself: Why did they obey him?), and to have no feeling whatsoever for one's fellow-humans. Living an existence totally without faith or purpose, it was suggested, merely leads to a desire to be quit of the whole rigmarole of absurdity. It became faintly interesting when it was intimated that Caligula actually wanted to die, and in any case he knew he would be killed sooner or later. In terms of return on investment this was one of the oddest ways of spending $25 million (that's what it says on my disc cover) I can imagine. Still, no odder than Caligula's own investment strategy. Actually, come to think of it, the whole thing was trash from start to finish. Also, Caligula was not the worst of the Roman Emperors: there was a later one called Heliogabalus, I think, who went even further than little Bootikins.  What a joke.
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|Abbath has returned since the sudden break up of Immortal, although it was sad, painful..I is nothing short of a Masterpiece.  Abbath has shown why he is metal's best musican.....Now time for the mighty Immortal shows in 2007, and hopefully a new album
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I love this guy and his debut CD. Really, truly every single song is fantastic. I don't even have a favorite, they are all just soooo good. His ballads will melt your heart and his other songs make you want to dance or at least move around in your chair. Not only does he have a great voice, he is darling with his Scottish accent and Italian good looks. Get this CD...you will not be sorry

1582701709|5.0|This book is an incredible companion to the film and audio productions. The Secret is by far the best piece of personal development material ever produced in the industry. This speaks to no single company or discipline. It has something for everyone, and it is meant for everyone. No doubt, the finest material for anyone in search of personal growth in spirituality and mind potential.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore's documentary on global warming is a true wakeup call for anyone who sees it. Al Gore's use of hard data in the film provides for a feeling of wanting to get involved and to help out. Mostly free of political bias, he really has a passion for the environment as he thinks long-term. I recommend everyone see this film, and I plan on getting it for a lot of friends and family so they can start to do something to help with this global crisis.
B00005JPBJ|5.0|Having just finished watching this movie half an hour ago, I think I can say that Saw 3 could very well be the best horror movie of this year. As seen in the previous 2 movies, it's full of twists, turns, and reveals even more of the story of the first 2 movies without ever losing your attention. It even recalls small characters from the first movie and makes them the main characters! Particularly the girl who worked with Dr. Gordon from the first movie. We get more into her character, who goes by Dr. Lynn in the movie, finding out she has a destructive family consisting of a husband and a daughter. However, the reason they're so out of hand is because they've been emotionally scarred ever since their young son died from getting hit by a taxi driver. She is caught and Amanda (Jigsaw's apprentice) forces her to help Jigsaw's health problems because he has a severe brain tumor, all the while her husband, Jeff, is having to go through a \\"maze\\" to find out who killed his son.<br /><br />However, as other reviewers have stated, the movie focuses more on Amanda than anyone else. Hey, like Jigsaw said, \\"Your life is in the hands of Dr. Lynn.\\" It turns out, Jigsaw was never through testing her, ever since he saved her from her drug addiction. Unfortunately, she failed. Well, there's a LOT more than that in the movie, but I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Saw 3 is easily my favorite movie of the series. The storyline is very interesting, the gore is top notch and very realistic, the torture devices are fascinating, it shows what big role Amanda actually has in all of Jigsaw's games, and there's even a level of emotion in it; mainly because we realize that only Amanda understood Jigsaw, and vice-versa. So if you're a fan of the Saw series, go to your local theater and watch it NOW. It's the best one in the series yet, and is my personal choice for best horror movie, and maybe movie, of the year.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|Once upon a time, Pearl Jam was my favorite band in the world.  I was never much of a Ten or Vs fan, but everything from Vitalogy through Binaural is just brilliant.  The melody, the creativity, the energy was just superb.  In the Yield/Binaural era, I once said that Eddie Vedder could release an album full of nursery rhymes, and I'd buy it. <br /> <br />Well, they've done it, and I bought it.  I was never really a Riot Act fan, but for all its flaws, it at least had one thing going for it--it was daring.  Some of its experiments didn't work, but at least there were experiments. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam (\\"Avocado\\"), to me, marks the onset of a new era for the band--an era when they ditch the prospects of coming up with interesting music in favor of pleasing the crowds.  Sure, this is their most well-received album in a long time.  But it is terrible.  There is but one song that is even above-average by their standards, and that is Severed Hand.  Everything else is just... Pearl Jam.  The same old formula, with no new ideas thrown in.
0743457900|4.0|I am only half way through but wanted to say that JLC writes wonderful prose far above the standard of most thriller writers and has a wonderful grasp of psychology. Extremely confusing but then spy stories always are and are intended to be. I keep remembering the excellent TV series and wished I'd watched the series all through but the series has not replaced the book. The TV version (I saw an episode again recently) has dated a bit and the book hasn't. The mid 70s when I was a schoolboy now seem very far away and yet so close....
0060512806|5.0|Got a month of free reading time? And that's free time for ONE book? This isn't a condemnation of Cryptonomicon by any means, just a warning to those who pick it up. Because once you start reading, chances are you won't be able to stop.<br /><br />Author Neal Stephenson is either an authentic genius or a certified wacko (or both), because Cryptonomicon is so intricate, so layered, and so engrossing, that someone who could write this much material, and contain it in one novel, must have an odd functionality to their brain.<br /><br />Spanning two generations of families during pre-, intra-, and post-WW II, this epic (and it most certainly deserves that title) shows the reader the early formation of computer language that developed thanks to code-breakers within the U.S. and German intelligence communities. This may sound horribly boring, but it is far from tedious. Author Stephenson knows not to bore readers. He incorporates cryptanalysis into everyday life, often with hysterically funny results (at one point a character relates his masturbatory behavior to helping solve enemy codes; and another time the London street layout helps design a code system that is nearly unbreakable). All of the characters are incredibly human, from the earliest \\"geeks\\" (Richard Waterhouse and Avi) to the rough-and-tumble WW II gladiators (U.S. Marine Bobby Shaftoe and General Douglas MacArthur). There are deadly battles with Japanese soldiers, crushing encounters with German U-boats, and even a treasure hunt finale that'll tickle your funny bone. There's romance between a geeky code breaker and the young granddaughter of Bobby Shaftoe. There's government conspiracies, and unlikely alliances between men on opposite sides of the war. There's ...just too much to put into one review! Fortunately, though, Neal Stephenson (author) masterfully ties all of these threads together and culminates it into one of the best conclusions seen in novel length fiction history.<br /><br />At 1,130 pages long (paperback), the thickness of Cryptonomicon may be a deal-breaker for some readers. Don't let it be. The author's able prose is sustained throughout its ample length and will keep readers coming back to see what awaits the Shaftoes, the Waterhouses, the Roots, and the Dengos.<br /><br />A prodigious novel from a genre-busting author, Cyptonomicon defies categorization. It is and isn't science fiction. It is and isn't historical fiction. It is and isn't a techno-thriller. It is and isn't many things. But the one thing it most certainly is is a masterpiece.ages long (paperback), the thickness of Cryptonomicon may be a deal-breaker for some readers. Don't let it be.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Really...isn't any true Beatles fan going to buy this?  And if you are indeed a true Beatles fan, you should buy Love. I've listened to it all the way through a couple times and I have to say that I really enjoy it.  The stereo version of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" alone is worth the price of the cd.  I do wish that the Martins had been a bit more adventurous with what they were doing, but I can imagine the trepidation they must have felt re-arranging and re-imagining the most sacred of all pop music and Love is after all sort of a soundtrack and I guess they felt the songs needed to stay relatively in tact so that the folks who went to the Cirque Du Soleil show wouldn't be totally disoriented.   <br /> <br />For the most part, what they've done works quite well and some of the arrangements are downright ingenious.  The sound is spectacular and I just have the cd.  I can only imagine what the 5.1 mix sounds like, though to be frank I enjoy the \\"old-fashioned\\" traditional stereo way of listening to music...it sounds somehow more powerful and \\"real\\" to me.  I'd love to hear a stereo mix of this stuff on SACD or DVD Audio.  Again, \\"Walrus\\" is just incredible...it is so good it's almost like listening to the thing for the first time all over again.   <br /> <br />It's also fun recognizing the bits of pieces that the Martins have taken from a  song and stuck onto something else.  The only negative is Love makes me want to hear the entire catalog remastered even more than the re-issues of Yellow Submarine and Let It Be did.  Why has it taken so long?  I guess Apple is pretty shrewd...they dribble things out over the years and really wring every penny they possibly can out of us.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is an album that's for fun.  I applaud Paul and Ringo for letting the project go forward.  At least they have a sense of humor and aren't so freaking stuffy about the Beatles' legacy to think that having a bit of fun with the catalog is some sort of blasphemy.  Come on...it's POP music.   <br /> <br />And is George Martin the coolest 80 year old ever or what?  Man...what a blessed life he's lived.  And so deserving...
0800177177|4.0|I have seen some odd reviews of this on Amazon, people saying it doesn't resemble the book in any way. Pish posh! Of all the Dracula versions I've seen (both Nosferatus, the Hammer ones, the dreadful 1970s Universal one), Coppola says the closest to the book.  <br /> <br />All right, so Mina isn't supposed to fall in love with the Count, but I enjoyed the way it frees her from her repressed role in the novel, and it's damn sexy. As far as I can tell, this romantic dimension is the only real way the film deviates from the book – I think Coppola was entitled to call it ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’.  <br /> <br />Personally, I also think the somewhat stiff acting (particularly Keanu) rather suits the feel of the novel – it’s theatrical in the same way One From the Heart was, and the film also utilizes many of the visual ideas Coppola developed for that film: shots and visuals are overlaid over each other, floating from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> It’s a million miles away from the realism of Herzog’s Nosferatu, but the stylized, sumptuous visual style (all filmed on a sound stage) work s just as well. It rather successfully harks back to the golden age of Hollywood, recalling films like Wizard of Oz and Singing In The Rain.  <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|Sandwiched between Tommy and Quadrophenia, this album more than holds its own. It is the crowning achievement of one of the world's greatest bands.  <br /> <br />From the still bizarre beginning of \\"Baba O'Reilly,\\" you know you're in for something special. The album never lets up, with great lead vocals by Pete, Roger and John. The original album ends with \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" which is the reason the word \\"anthem\\" was created.  <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are all interesting too. But you need to get this one for the new, fresh sound of the original tracks. This disc is without equal.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Junk-science!  You people need to unbrainwash yourselves in a hurry.  This \\"man-made\\" global warming is one of the biggest frauds ever to be foisted on the world.  You need to train yourselves on how not to succumb to this propaganda.  I don't know if Al Gore is just a useful idiot that believes this nonsense or is a willing accomplise.  I have seen him speak and I believe thatn he is a mentally unstable sociopath.   <br />    Now, has any of these experts talked about huge volcanic eruptions such as Krakatoa and Pinotubo that have spewed more greenhouse gases, sulfuric acid and billions of tons of other crap into our atmosphere for centuries (many times more than we humans can ever dream of).  No.  Have they explained how ice ages have come and gone with no human intervention.  No.  How water vapor (clouds)  have much more of an effect on climate than CO2. No.   <br />     People, simply put the purpose of the global warming scare is politcal.  Notice how Al Gore was not a Global Warming fanatic until he got his but handed to him in the 2000 election.  Its about making people afraid and thus allowing more regulation and hurting our Country economically.  Dont fall for this crap.  Wake up. <br />

B00005JPCY|1.0|I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now, for the most part,  a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on sites like Amazon.com!<br /><br />While I have no complaint with the acting, the storyline is just utterly ridiculous, and boring as sin. I don't think it is asking too much  for a story to make some sense, instead of  treating the movie going public like a bunch of teenagers looking for some cheap thrills!<br /><br />Where do I begin? This highly professional terrorist has no motive for his madness. He pops out of the blue, belongs to no organizations or movements, and has no ideology, no allies, and no one helping him. Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being \\"too much\\" of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest. (Plus a cigarette, of course, don't all bad guys smoke these days?) Oh, please, give me a break! How sanitized a story can you get? The filmmakers and screenwriters of Deja Vu have absolutely no guts, whatsoever, to make any kind of statement other than that terrorists are crazy and get hurt feelings! Wow! What an interesting insight!<br /><br />Next, The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last  Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals, which, in-turn, all end-up going into cardiac arrest, and dying. But when our fearless hero, Denzel Washington, goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears. Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier, and it knocked out a whole city's power!<br /><br />The dying problem is also solved too, with a full recovery taking less than a day. Keep in mind, when most people recover from  going  into cardiac arrest, they are usually not stong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of  HOURS later! But Denzel is special, and he doesn't even have super powers!<br /><br />When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet, he begins losing blood fast. So fast in fact, that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room, pronto! Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints. There they wash his wound with water and dry it with paper towels. He miracuously stops bleeding because he washed his wound. No need for stiches or compresses, just soap and water stops bleeding from gunshot wounds. Imagine what other miracles would have occurred if he had the time to wash the rest of his body!<br /><br />I think you get the picture. This is such a dopey film because the  stupidity is non-stop! It's a shame films are not rated based on cleverness and intelligence. If they were, perhaps filmmakers would start making more interesting movies!recovery taking less than a day.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Like others have said here, this album was worth the (extra long) wait!  Beautiful, emotion-packed music and singing (Loreena's voice is gorgeously haunting) that will have you dreaming of moonlit nights and far off lands.  And we've also got her PBS special and a tour to look forward to in 2007!

B000IU3Y1O|5.0|To put things plainly and clearly mindful shopper...This is a first true \\"BEST OF\\" Depeche Mode.<br /><br />Each collection prior to this release only showcased a set of singles in a consecutive order.  I am referencing \\"Catching Up With Depeche Mode\\" from 1986, \\"The Singles: 86-98\\" from 1998, and \\"The Singles: 81-85\\" from 1999.<br /><br />Finally, a remastered set of songs (selected by Daniel Miller who needs no introduction), that span the entire career of the band.  Might I say that the proof is in the pudding!  If you are an archivist or just a<br /><br />dedicated fan, you must own this set.  Beautifully packaged with liner notes written by Paul Morley co-founder of The Art Of Noise, also responsible for the success of the infamous Frankie Goes To Hollywood.  Each single is noted in random order, which keeps you guessing the whole way through! Kudos!<br /><br />\\"Martyr\\" the brand new single sits perfect amongst this collage of pain and pleasure.  In fact I might have to say that this track is one of their best of the last 10 years!  Pure ear candy my friends.<br /><br />Depeche Mode as a whole create music that transcends all generations.  Their songs merge with you when you are young and continue into your adult life.  We can identify with the lyrics, and my friends,  I am very sure that each of you have several memories no matter how vivid or remarkable reflected in a Depeche Mode song.  Best Band on the planet?  I say without refute!<br /><br />The DVD is the treasure!  Consecutively, I say with a chuckle, 23 videos from 1980-2006.  Most of us have these already,  but the real easter egg is the short film documenting each song!!!  My personal thanks to DM for stuffing these little bits in their releases!<br /><br />We simply just can't get enough!
B000I2J2W2|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Forbidden Planet, it has long held a place in my heart as one of the all time Sci Fi greats. Needless to say after getting an HD DVD player I was excited to pick this up, and check it out. The results unfortunately are mixed. The principal photography of the movie has an excellent HD DVD transfer, tons of detail so much in fact I was rather amused to clearly see the lines between the physical sets and the painted backdrops!  <br /> <br />Ok so now the bad part. Any shots that feature FX work by Disney (laser fx, the ID monster etc) are all blurry. They look like standard DVD definition compared to the HD DVD footage that surrounds them. You see quite a pop when the image cuts from fx footage to on set photography. The image sharply gets more detailed, or swapping to FX less detailed. Its a shame WB couldn't really do this special edition the justice it deserves by getting the quality consistent all through the movie.  <br /> <br />The movie has lots of great extras, but the mix and match nature of the image quality sadly hurts the overall presentation. <br /> <br />
0380789019|5.0|I really enjoyed the Anansi Boys so when I was looking for another book to read, I came across Neverwhere.  Neil Gaiman is a great writer.  I found myself staying up into the wee hours of the night to finish the book (yet wishing that it would not end and the story would continue).  I highly recommend this book if you like fantasy books.
B00023BLXK|3.0|I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought \\"This movie was MADE for me,\\" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution. <br /> <br />I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting. <br /> <br />First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the \\"will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change\\" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than \\"He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.\\"  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that? <br /> <br />I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared. <br /> <br />And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that \\"Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?\\" (Iam exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.) <br /> <br />And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.   <br /> <br />And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the \\"stupidest decision in a movie ever,\\" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revolución, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between \\"boy and girl live happily ever after\\" to \\"girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.\\"  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of \\"I know that we'll meet again,\\" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, \\"that boy is going to have to stop dancing andlearn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.\\"   <br /> <br />I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.  And then Katey's optimistic \\"We'll see each other again someday!\\" was just waaaay too much for me. <br /> <br />So, in short, if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain while watching a movie, this one's going to give you a lot of issues.  If you CAN turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is--a dance movie--you'll probably like it, though find some things (like the romance) lacking.

0618680004|2.0|Dr Dawkins is an articulate writer and public speaker. His ideas are interesting and sometimes well researched. His appreciation of religious views is fairly poor because he tends to see Christianity almost exclusively in terms of American evangelical-fundamentalism; though he is aware of non-fundamentalist views within Christianity.    He advocates ridicule of the things he thinks are ridiculous. That is the core of his argument. If it looks ridiculous then ridicule it.    There's a problem with that approach. It will not persuade. It will not reach into the world view that a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew holds. So this book is addressed to people who are already inclined to accept its premise - namely that belief in the kind of God that the Bible reveals is ridiculous.    If Dr Dawkins wrote this book to \\"reach people\\" then his method dooms him to fail in that goal. If he wrote it to earn some money, then he'll achieve the goal.

Pros / Benefits when this came out in 2006:    1) Includes every studio album w/ Jim Morrison (meaning it leaves out Other Voices & Full Circle)  2) Includes rare unreleased versions of songs & the Studio version of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\"  3) Includes a 5.1 Surround Sound DVD of each album with videos    MAIN PRO:   4) The 2006 version is $150 list, the 2008 version is now $80 list or currently $65 on amazon.  I tried to find out if their are any difference between the 2 releases, and I could not find any.  If anyone finds anything definite, please let me know, because otherwise this price drop certainly makes it worth to consider, and is still cheaper then the out of print \\"Complete Studio Recordings Box Set\\" see below.     Cons / Things You Might Want to Know (but is not bad at $80):    1) This is not the 1st release of all the doors albums w/ Jim Morrison in it in 1 box, that goes to \\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\" Box Set released in 1999, which includes the exact same re-masters, but unfortunately is out of print since this was released.    2) This does not include the \\"Essential Rarities\\" bonus disc found in the \\"Complete Studio Recordings\\" Box Set, which you can buy separately  3) The 5.1 Surround Sound DVD's lack superior sound quality as one might expect according to other reviewers, which you can also buy separately  4) All the bonus tracks from this box (I'm pretty sure anyway) can be obtained from the 2007 re-released versions of the albums      Ok, now some suggestions:  1) If you are looking for some great footage of the Doors on DVD and have none, get the \\"Doors Collection\\" DVD, that shows the best concertfootage and films of them  2) If you want more unreleased material, seek the \\"The Doors Box\\", which is a 4 cd box set including rare & semi-live versions of songs that I don't believe you can get anywhere else, but look that up yourself  3) Again, because of this huge price drop which I still find quite unusual, this is actually a good deal at $80 and certainly at $65 currently on amazon, but not at the $150 when it was first released.  If you want all the re-mastered albums, I think this is the way to go.    Hope this helps.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Making movies is an awesome album by one of the finest bands to come out of england. It has awesome rock tunes like Expresso love, Tunnel of love, and skateaway. Highly recommended.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|People around me were singing this movies praises, so I rented it for Thanksgiving. Frankly I thought it was as a result of the tryptophan that none of us watching it could bear to wade through the wafer thin characters, erratic editing and disjointed thoughts of the writer/director. I enjoyed Traffic but this was unbearable.     To give the movie a fighting chance, I watched it again the next day thinking that I had probably dozed through some of it and this was why it made little impact. Nope I was wrong, same old crap! There are too many characters to care about any of them. (Spoilers removed for anyone dopey enough to watch this snoozefest - H. Mullan)    Had this been a three part miniseries it would have been done better. As it is do yourself a favor and miss this one. Or on the other hand, rent Gigli, Syriana and Glitter and invite your friends for a worst movie night ever.    By the way, if you suffer from insomnia, may I suggest using this movie instead of medication as Syriana does not appear to have any ill side effects.
B0002OERI0|5.0|GREEN DAY are one of the finest groups to have come out in the SF BAY AREA after Metallica. Billie Joe Armstrong is an excellent singer who has a great voice. American idiot is a great album and has some of the greatest songs like the awesome 9 min epic JESUS OF SUBURBIA and HOLIDAY. <br />Highly recommended.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Usually these type records don't live up to expectations, but this is an exception. Clapton and JJ Cale are terrific together. First rate songs,mostly written by Cale, and down and dirty guitar work from two masters. John Mayer and Derek Trucks add some nice licks, as well as the late Billy Preston on keyboards. To the critics here who harp about this being too laid back and the ages of the musicians, skip this and get the new Josh Grobin or Clay Aiken discs. This album is the real thing, done with skill and passion. I hope JJ and Eric do this again soon. Highly recommended.
B00000J2KR|5.0|Whatever you think of the story, the actors, the dubious casting of Ryan O'Neal, you should watch this movie simply to see the art of cinematography at its highest form. An absolute feast for the eyes.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|A literally very dark movie. Sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. You'll probably have a headache after watching it! It's pretty low-key in comparison with the T.V. series, but this film version is truer to Mann's original vision. Thankfully it's not a buddy-buddy cop caper movie and we don't witness the usual inane banter and wisecracking. However, if i have one criticism of this and most other Michael Mann movies it's that they have absolutely no humour in them. Heat could be regarded as an exception but that's down to Al Pacino's overacting rather than director's input! That said Miami Vice is pretty riveting stuff. Jamie Foxx is good enough in the role but doesn't have too much to do. However Colin Farrell is totally miscast. He's looks like an early twenty-something playing dress-up, and dress-up with a mullet and tache no less! (by his appearance i imagine he was intending to audition for a Metallica bio-pic but wandered into the wrong room) They should have got a more mature actor for this role. I mean we're supposed to believe that Foxx and Farrell have been together for years and trust each other implicity. It just doesn't work with Farrell in the roll. Also, he has zero chemistry with Gong-Li, but it's hard to blame Farrell for that as I couldn't understand a word she said in the whole movie. She should have had a translater. I surprised Farrell didn't say \\"pardon?\\" or \\"come again?\\" at least once to her. I don't dislike Farrell but he's extremely limited and I think he's more ideally suited to those slick, cocky roles that Cruise used to do in the '80s - Top Gun, Color of Money, Days of Thunder - where action sequences would distract from his limitations. Excellent direction by Mann and good entertainment throughout but doubtful you're wife or girlfriend would watch it with you, unless she wants to see Colin Farrell dressed up as a redneck!
B000002H5I|5.0|I got the LP version of this album as a Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it. She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the Reagan years (\\"Talkin about a Revolution\\", \\"Fast Car\\"). But she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. \\"Mountains O Things\\" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she covers are racism (\\"Across the Lines\\") and domestic abuse (\\"Behind the Wall\\"). Even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988. <br /> <br />I bought the CD version in 1992 and I never get tired of listening to it. All of the songs are good but my favorite ones are \\"Talking about a Revolution\\", \\"Fast Car\\", \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\", \\"Mountains of Things\\", \\"Why\\" and \\"For My Lover\\". <br /> <br />
B000GFLAI0|1.0|yet again as with love and theft  dylan has gone into the studio with one song.As with suger baby its the last offering of a medeoce album,but is a great song.I think dylans talent now lays with his book writing more than his music. Sometimes you just run out of things to say and its more interesting to look back and shed light on a wonderful life.If dylan comes  with another song (and i thiunk he always can) release it as a single not an album and let columbia deal with more reissues.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I would consider this relaxing. Not in the ambient, electronic sort of way; this is very much blues. It's a different kind of blues; trance blues, which is Junior Kimborough's (all of these are covers) stamp on the blues. My words can not begin to describe how much this EP means to me. It's study music, it's driving music, it's music to make love to. <br /> <br />Just get it.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I have all 4 seasons of Alias on DVD but I bought the Complete Collection because of all the bonus features. Whoever marketed this product is really stretching the truth by saying a hardbook 'book' is included. I would call it more of a 'booklet' considering it is about the size of liner notes in a CD case and maybe 20 pages. The contents of the 'book' are disappoining as well. It featues questions and answers that most fans already know and pics from episodes - I thought mayeb they would include some behind the scenes footage but nope. <br /> <br />If you don't have any of the Alias DVD's then this set is worth getting. If you are just buying it for the 'bonus features' that could only be found in the set, then I would skip it.
B0000027EP|5.0|While I remain loyal to the Eddie Clarke era of Motorhead, I must admit \\"1916\\" is as good as latter period Motorhead ever got.<br /><br />  The production is much better, with plenty of loud guitars and drums.  If there is a weak spot, it would be that Wurzel and Co. are pretty generic players.  The profiency is there, but not much originality exists.<br /><br />  To make up for that weakness, which has plagued all post-Clarke releases, with the exception of \\"Another Perfect Day\\", Lemmy throws in a keyboard heavy \\"Nighttime\\", an honest-to-God power ballad (\\"Love Me Forever\\"), a Ramones tribute, and most shocking of all, the title track and album closer, \\"1916\\".<br /><br />  Lemmy is a well-known war historian, definitely nobody's dummy, and here he laments a particularly horrible battle in WWI where 10,000 soldiers died before noon with neither side gaining an inch of ground.  Set to a lonely mournful organ and a snare drum, Lemmy sings in a clear voice and by song's end, it's damn hard not to get a lump in your throat the first couple times you hear it, so surprising is the music, yet so perfect.<br /><br />  For this track and the stretching out of musical boundaries that Lemmy undertakes on \\"1916\\", it is an essential for Motorhead fans.
B000001F6N|5.0|The song \\"The Supernatural\\" is why I started playing guitar and was my introduction to Peter Green who went on to steal Mayall's drummer and bass player (Mick Fleetwood and John Macvie) and started Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac which was a chicago style blues band.
0345308239|5.0|This book pretty much informed my entire world view.  Tuchman posits the existance of folly, which she defines as the pursuit of public policy contrary to self-interest.  For folly to exist there has to be an alternative course of action, a large and vocal opposition, and I forget the third thing.  She takes as her template the Trojans taking the Greek horse inside the walls of Troy, and goes on to use the Renaissance popes causing the Reformation, the British losing the American colonies, and the Americans in Vietnam to underline her thesis.<br /><br />Tuchman is such a great writer, none of the didacticism of the academic here, no \\"as we shall sees\\".  She writes about real people screwing up with such lucidity and such exasperation.  \\"Lord, what fools these mortals be!\\"<br /><br />My other two Tuchman favorites are A Distant Mirror and Stilwell and the American Experience in China.  But everything she wrote is good.  I'm still mad at her for dying before she could write more.
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" is an intriguing and captivating novel about Santiago, a Spanish shepherd boy who goes on a quixotic quest to find himself.  Leaving the security of his flock and livelihood behind, Santiago crosses the Straits of Gibraltar into Morocco only to be duped into handing his money over to a nattily dressed thief.  Enter Plan B where Santiago spends a year in the coastal city of Tangier working for a crystal ware merchant.<br /><br />Santiago earns money and learns some valuable lessons, but ignores his shopkeeper's advice by not returning home.  Hitching up with a caravan headed east, Santiago gets dropped off at an Egyptian oasis not far from his destination of the Pyramids of Giza.  The story's time period is not revealed, but it is clearly set before World War II.  Therefore, travel is both arduous and dangerous.  After a stay at the oasis, during which he meets a fascinating young woman named Fatima, Santiago sets out again.<br /><br />Without the protection of a caravan, our hero is vulnerable and finds himself in scarier and scarier situations.  In due course, a group of marauders take him captive and are about to kill him, but Santiago wagers that if he can change himself into the wind, he should be let go.  With shades of Carlos Castaneda's \\"Journey to Ixtlan,\\" Santiago pulls it off and resumes his trek.  Then, with the Pyramids in sight, he discovers an answer to his quest.  Only later does he reach his true destination, and with a couple of unexpected twists thrown in for good measure.  A refreshing and insightful tale!  Fr. Dennis Mercieri
B000002P2W|4.0|Really, I don't see why so many are so quick to pan the Who By Numbers. Sure, it's not in the league of, say, Who's Next. But there's a lot to like about this release. We all agree that Slip Kid; Squeeze Box (a fun song); Dreaming from the Waist (which addresses Pete's issues with sex); and However Much I Booze (which is about his alcoholism, obviously) are the best song. I'd also stick up for Entwistle's Success Story and especially the heavily underrated Imagine a Man, two songs you really don't hear that much about, which is too bad. In other words, the first half of this album is pure gold. The second is where it drops off, other than How Many Friends (the homophobic bit aside). Let's face it, there's not really much to like about They Are All In Love, Blue, Red and Gray or In a Hand or a Face. But it IS interesting to hear a rock star attack his demons, though I'll admit Roger's tough-guy bluster gets in the way. But it's a good album all the same. This is comprable to the Stones' It's Only Rock 'n' Roll: both are great discs that not many appreciate.
1582701709|5.0|This is a good book & video and worth  both reading & seeing by everyone, but when I say everyone I mean almost everyone because some of us already know this and are only happy to find these ideas finding a more accessable channel to the masses.  <br /> <br />I don't mean to sound like I'm talking down to anyone because I am not intentionally, it's just that it has felt for sooooo long that the majority of humanity didn't care about truth or bettering oneself, not only to find happiness with oneself but to make life and the world a better place to exist.  <br /> <br />So by all means get this video, change the way you think, your perspective, your life and the world but if you want to know where these ideas came from, that is who brought them to the awaremness of the few in his struggled to bring them to the many, then you'll want to learn from Robert Anton Wilson what he tried to teach us over the last 30 years and 20+ books in both fiction and nonfiction.

B00005JPCY|5.0|Denzel Washington fans will not be disappointed with his latest work in this sci-fi / action / drama / thriller quadruple punch of a powerhouse film.     The plot centers on an honest, hard-working ATF officer Doug Carlin (played by Denzel Washington) who is recruited by Agent Pyzwarra (Val Kilmer), into a super secret domestic spy agency to help them track down the identity of a terrorist bomber who killed 500 innocent people in the most horrific act of violence since 9-11. Agent Carlin almost immediately becomes suspicious of the voracity of his recruiters when they demonstrate a new piece of spy equipment that they conveniently fail to mention allows them to peek four days into the past and piece together the scene of a crime.     As with all films dealing with time travel, temporal paradoxes pop up everywhere as Carlin tries to save the life of the stunningly beautiful but hapless Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who unwittingly falls prey to the vile terrorist, and with whom of course, Carlin falls in love.     It's fascinating to watch Carlin chase clue after mysterious clue that he left for himself in another time line as the two alternate realities collide in a series of mishaps that ultimately lead to the death of his partner, the murder of the woman he loves, (Loved? Will love?), and an ever chaotic series of time shifts as he races against the clock to save the lives of innocents as well as the object of his love interest. Will he succeed? All I'll say is the cliff hanging finale will surprise and delight you as our hero finally confronts the most vicious human being he's ever encountered.     The cast is superb in this mind twisting race through the imagination and the film will positively keep you on the edge of your seat until the very heart stopping end.     It's rated PG-13 for graphic violence but if you enjoy brain teasing action that will thrill you from start to finish, then you want to watch this movie!

0307341542|4.0|I really enjoyed this mystery and I don't usually pick up novels like this. Unlike Eye Contact (which was flat and obvious), Sharp Objects leads you in different directions with a cast of characters who could have committed the murders. It was a real page-turner to find out who actually did it. <br /> <br />I did have a slight problem picturing the main protag's skin as she suffered from years of self-mutilation. <br /> <br />Other than that, Flynn's writing was lively and visual and I really enjoyed this novel.
079284131X|4.0|Usually the first movie it's allways the best one,I like this one because it was more serious than the others that came after,I liked the first three movies but the the original is my favorite!
055358202X|2.0|As a huge fan of the first books in this series, I have been enormously disappointed by this most recent episode -- the series now seems to be going the way of Jordan\\"s \\"the Wheel of Time\\".  Truly the energy and sweep of the first books is understandably difficult to maintain, but all good things must come to an end -- preferably without being spun out interminably.  Other reviewers mention variously 1) that half the book was cut by the publisher to get to 1000 pages and 2) that the book is too long by several hundred pages as it is.  Either way, this is a story that has bogged down, and needs some energy to overcome the mercenary logistics of word count.  So, save your money and hope that Martin comes back up to bat in the next episode.

B000ERU5EK|5.0|It was Above & Beyond, both directly through their various projects, and indirectly through the Anjunabeats label, that first introduced me to trance, and they remain in my eyes one of the most consistently high-quality artists of the genre.<br /><br />There is a lot of attention given to composition and songwriting here, as is typical of anything carried on Anjunabeats. Gimmicks and image engineering are completely absent, a stark contrast with the surprisingly pervasive dance music with which many Americans are familiar. Compared to that category, Tri-State is awash with emotion, subtle effects, and a careful application of symmetry and music theory.<br /><br />\\"Can't Sleep\\" might as well be the best representation of this flavor of trance this year (at least since Max Graham's remix of the Jessica Jacobs song \\"I Know You're Gone\\"). A poignant, throbbing masterpiece that could almost carry the weight of the album on its own, it is among the trio's best work.<br /><br />Contrasting with the emotional, vocally intoxicating sound of \\"Can't Sleep\\" is \\"Indonesia\\" - a purely instrumental piece that could best be described as \\"intriquing.\\" Together with other tracks that introduce vocals in different techniques, the result is a varied landscape of sound that nonetheless remains stylistically cohesive.<br /><br />There is just a bit of filler on here that prevents me from giving the CD a cup-runneth-over raving. Also, \\"Air For Life\\" is a great song, but was released so far in advance of this album that it feels like old music to me. Granted, if you don't haunt the Anjunabeats web site for new releases as I do, you are unlikely to have noticed this. It's just that my opinion of Above & Beyond is so high that I don't hold them to the same standard as many other artists.  If you have even the slightest appreciation of trance, it's hard to imagine being disappointed in this album.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Perhaps the most telling thing that could be said about John Williams' score for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is that it doesn't really sound like a John Williams score.  For the most part, with a few notable exceptions, I have generally found John Williams' over-reliance on catchy themes and trite progressions to be very rarely to my personal taste. Fortunately (both for the film and for those of us listening to the score), the music for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" has none of those usual markers. In fact, this may well be Williams' best work in a long time.<br /><br />The music for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" captures the spirit of the film well -- memorable yet subtle, beautiful yet haunting, intimate yet mysterious. Like the geisha tradition itself, the music is a study in contradiction and cool sensuality.  There is a theme that runs as an undercurrent through most of the score, an understated and quiet refrain against which each individual piece is set.  Overall, taken from beginning to end, the story of the film is encapsulated in its music -- not so much the details of plot, but the emotional elements that are key to conveying the feeling of the story.<br /><br />It would be remiss to talk about the composer of the music without pointing out the performances that bring the compostion to life.  Yo-Yo Ma  playing cello and virtuoso Ithzak Perlman playing violin both have some remarkable solos throughout the score, and it through their flawless performances that the music is realized.  Each player puts a piece of themselves into the music, elevating it to something more.<br /><br />Good film music acts in an intimate relationship with the film it accompanies. It makes its presence known without being showy or overly demonstrative. It accompanies in such a way that you might not notice it immediately, but later you realize that the experience would be greatly lacking if it was not there. It feeds emotion with subtle movement and careful craft. Like the geisha, the music for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" casts a haunting spell that will not soon be forgotten, and cannot be ignored.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" casts a haunting spell that will not soon be forgotten, and cannot be ignored.
B00000ICN5|5.0|The liner notes of this CD quote a 1981 spectator of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble's live show: \\"It was like church.\\"    That's exactly what it was like. I used to say it was \\"like a religion,\\" some 25 years ago, for me to show up an hour early at Fitzgerald's in Houston, to be first in line when the club opened and get a table right in front of SRV's microphone. What I remember most vividly is his hands on his guitar. He didn't schmooze his audience; he didn't have much patter. Stevie Ray expressed himself through his fingers, and he poured out his soul.    I think he knew very well that one night, my hand was regularly moving in my purse because I was starting and stopping a tape recorder. According to SRV, he was then stuck in a recording contract with someone who would release neither an album nor him from the contract. I listened to that bootleg frequently between his live appearances. (Don't ask: I no longer have it and wouldn't copy it if I did.)    Thus I can \\"Testify\\" that the cuts on this first album faithfully replicate the sound of his performance of these songs. Nothing is added - there are only bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton ably anchoring SRV's guitar - and nothing is taken away. If the trio required more than one recording for each of these tracks, it was only to choose among SRV's brilliant improvisations.    The liner notes from the follow-up album, COULDN'T STAND THE WEATHER, emphasize SRV's macho appearance as this Texan blasted away a New York City audience. \\"Macho\\" is not what SRV was like. He had a slight build. He was soft-spoken. The last cut on the original issue of TEXAS FLOOD, a tribute to SRV's wife, is exquisitely tender, the opposite of macho - in front of God and everyone! SRV played not to impose himself on his listeners but to persuade. Which is ultimately much more powerful.    I learned only from the liner notes for the TEXAS FLOOD reissue that SRV is credited with igniting the 1980s blues revival. That's what a prophet is for, isn't it?
B0001O3YC6|1.0|This may be the worst movie I have sat all the way through. <br /> <br />I kept thinking (or hoping) not that it would get better but that it would get less bad. <br /> <br />It didn't.  It just went from bad to worse. <br /> <br />This is chiefly because of bad writing throughout, lame special effects, and bad--spectacularly bad--acting on the part of the two principal white males. <br /> <br />Cole Hauser, who plays Vin Diesel's Probation Officer, learned acting in modeling school: to act, strike poses.  He overacts, or I should say overposes, shamelessly. <br /> <br />Vin Diesel has the opposite technique.  He apparently filmed this while in a coma.  Either that or he phoned it in, and his body was produced by special effects. <br /> <br />The women aren't bad, but nothing can redeem this hopeless clunker. <br /> <br />Even the creatures aren't very frightening.  And the more you see them, the less frightening they get.  All of $1.75 was spent on their computer animation. <br /> <br />And at least that much was spent on red-syrup for blood.  There is also a lot of blue-syrup for blood.  This is either the creatures' blood, or simply some arty filming. <br /> <br />Also in the Arty Filming Dept. is the overall YELLOW of the first scenes.  Later this is dropped, with no explanation.  Also dropped is the notion that the survivors have to use breathing apparatus.  I guess they got tired of sucking on tubes.  These simply disappear. <br /> <br />They aren't the only ones that suck.  Marvelously sucky are the stabs at Portentous Dialogue.  Seeing Vin Diesel debate (or somnabulate) theology with the Muslim guy is truly amusing.  (But don't eat your lunch first.) <br /> <br />What redeems this whole mess is the fact that YOU DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. When they die, or when they escape, you don't care.   <br /> <br />A silly comedy.  The songs are especially unmemorable.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Brick is a very ambitious attempt at hybrid yet derivitive indy type film making.  Such attempts can yield incredible results as in Slingblade, Pulp Fiction or Blair Witch Project.  Other times the result is a miserable mess.  Unfortunately, Brick is a steaming pile that is more akin to the latter than the former. <br /> <br />Set in the modern day, Brick is essentially a 40's style noir tale juxtaposed to a cast of Southern California highschool street rats.  After having seen the film, my recurring thought was \\"Why?\\"  I suppose I can see how someone might think this story concept could work.  It's a fairly original concept.  I'll give it that.  I'll even allow that the right treatment of Brick very well could have worked to some degree.  Unfortunately, it definitely does not work here. <br /> <br />The major characteristics and archetypes of the noir genre are represented in Brick.  As in many noir films the dialogue is highly stylized and germane only to the universe in which the story takes place.  There is a machine gun cadence to the dialogue delivery that, at times is unintentionally funny.  Unintentional humor is not something filmmakers should shoot for.  It's a good thing people in the real world don't talk the way noir characters do.  If they did no one would understand a thing anyone else was saying.  I appreciate this aspect of the noir genre and have enjoyed it when done well in classic noir films.  But in Brick, it's just too hard to believe that modern day Southern California teens could ever be capable of such dialogue.  It is also hard to swallow the notion that these kids could have lived long enough to become as jaded as is necessary to be authentic noir characters.  As such the entire foundation on which the film rests rings completely false.  These failures totally undermine Brick's character plausibility and represent a fundamental and fatal flaw.  Clearly, the film sounds like a duck, but we know all along that it's not a duck. <br /> <br />The hero of the tale is of course a romantically tortured tough guy loner.  His adversary (aside from the entire world) is a highly intelligent yet amoral and calculating crime boss with a gaggle of lesser minded goons in tow.  There is the obligatory murder victim around which conflict must revolve.  There is a brainy touchstone and ally of the hero who seemingly exists for no other purpose than to do the heroe's grunt work and flesh out details to advance the mostly uninspired plot.  There's even a Macguffin thrown in for good measure, which in this film's case is of course a brick (of heroin).  I am confident when I say that my divulging of these details does not in anyway constitute a spoiler. <br /> <br />The noir genre by definition is hinged upon extreme melodrama, quirky and intense dialogue and extreme machismo.  When depicted with a backdrop of plausible characters the formula can work very well.  But when channeled through modern day teens whom we know are much more likely to be downloading P-Diddy tunes on their MP3 players than playing gumshoes to murder, the whole affair simply collapses under it's own weight.  The director and writer aimed high and should be commended for that.  They just missed this time.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The first time I tried watching this, I stopped after 15 minutes.  (It's 3 hours long; so I stuck it out for about 8%.) <br /> <br />Later (painfully) I watched the whole thing, and tried to put my finger on what was so bad about it. <br /> <br />Bad acting?  Yes, surely. Ben Affleck's shameless hamming and godknowswhere accent are brutal.  Alec Baldwin's scenery-chewing is laughable.  The feather-headedness of ALL the females is insulting and stereotyping and deadly.  <br /> <br />But it wasn't just acting.  After all, Josh Harnett and Cuba Gooding and Jon Voight aren't too bad, considering.  It's also atrocious writing.  It seldom rises even to the level of cliche. <br /> <br />And pacing.  Everything is glacially SLOW.  The movie actually takes longer than the events themselves.   <br /> <br />And characterization.  To say these characters are shallow is to give them too much credit.  They are way beyond shallow and into the territory of the transparent.  They are made of smoke and acetate.   <br /> <br />And tension--or lack thereof.  The characters are so depthless and the pacing so static, you can't honestly care which of the interchangeable heroes gets the girl, or even who wins the war.  If THIS is what America is all about, maybe the Japanese should win. <br /> <br />But I think worst of all (and this is saying a lot) is the music. <br /> <br />Seldom or never have I heard such unadulterated schmaltz.  Endless glissandi of strings, tear-jerking angel choirs, cliche-dramatic horns--every second. <br /> <br />It amazes me that even Hollywood, as good at trivializing as it is, could reduce something like the Pearl Harbor attack to a soap opera for sixth graders. <br /> <br />Dull.  Dumb.  Dreary.  Deadly.  Dolorous.  Damp.
0783114222|5.0|Born in 1957, I was as attached to the space race as any young boy could be during the 1960's.  It was part of my being and I watch Neil Armstrong put his first boot on the Moon via a well used black and white TV.  This series brought all that back for me and told me 'the rest of the story.'  It is not a story that can be told in an hour, or two, or five, and it is hard for my children to understand how the Apollo program changed the world technologically, socialogically, and psychologically, but From Earth to the Moon brings the story to life.  If anyone but Tom Hanks had done this it wouldn't have been the same.  Bravo.
B000J103N4|5.0|This album has special significance for me as it, along with the Dead's American Beauty and a couple of classical LPs acompanied me on a trip to South America at the beginning of the '70s. perhaps it was because Crosby's sailing experience oozed from the grooves (I too was at sea). This is arguably Crosby's best work (it is to me). The richly crafted harmonies, carefully woven acoustic accompaniment and general \\"aura\\" of the overall album make it a gem of the period. It is criminal that this work has been so overlooked. Although Crosby is the dominant featured performer and composer, this LP highlights the then lively communal SF music scene. Those followers of the current underground scene would identify with this. Standout guest performances include glorious Joni Mitchell vocals (along with Neil Young), earthy Garcia guitar and potent Phil Lesh bass lines. Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady also provide excellent supporting roles. I can't identify one particular track, 'cause the WHOLE album is so damn good and works so well as an organic whole. Over the years, I have found myself repeadedly coming back to this album for inspiration. Inspiration for what?...writing my own music, recapturing a feeling which oozes from these grooves and, yes, inspiring my life through just listening to the music. THIS IS '60S MUSIC OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND IN THE BEST SENSE. Its a treasure undiscovered by many people. Discover it yourself, set back and be prepared to be touched by its magic!!
B00006LLNU|5.0|A common whine today is that music isn't like it used to be, and that there is nothing good coming out still.  This record is one of the many arguements against that ill informed babble.<br /><br />Sigur Ros's () album is among one of the most intensely beautiful things you'll ever hear.  If you scan most of these reviews i'm sure it will be a common thought, as it is among most all of the people I know who listen to this group. The music at its peak is like staring down from a huge perch overlooking a neverending city of ice and glass on a crisp winter morning while realising that your life is the sum of so many greater things.  The tracks stick with you in the pit of your soul, this is an album you want think, feel, write, drink, and make love when listening to.<br /><br />I firmly believe this album will be considered a classic in so many years, paired up against albums like My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\" ,the Cure's \\"Disintergration\\" or Radiohead's \\"Ok Computer\\".  And hopefully new bands will take a cue and use it as an influence down the road.
1582701709|5.0|I am so loving, happy, and grateful that this groundbreaking movie was put together by these true champions of information! After viewing \\"The Secret,\\" everything that I've researched from a scientific and spiritual perspective immediately clicked. I was instantly inspired! Actually, I've been inspired by the powerful messeges in the film ever since. After viewing the movie, it then became apparent that I needed to evaluate my current paradigms along with my conscious and subconscious way of thinking! I took massive and immediate action and assumed all responsibility for my previous, habituated way of thinking. Then, I began to remove all resistance out of my life and create empowering paradigms and relationships by using tips and powerful insight from \\"The Secret.\\" For instance, when I first get up in the morning, I rattle through everything that I'm grateful for and create my day as it was intended. I speak, focus, and visualize positive things into form on a daily basis. I also listen to James Ray's \\"Science of Success System\\" in the car and everywhere I go, driving the empowering material deep into my subconscious.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to tell you how fast my intentions and visualizations are manifesting presently! I was able to write my first best-selling book within two months after viewing the movie! The words and ideas for the book just kept flowing unlike anything I ever experienced before. My practice has exploded in patient volume and financial collections in the last several months as well!  I'm constantly attracting powerful business partnerships at a very fast pace and now have several streams of revenue. I am continuously drawing abundance and prosperity into my life and I'm convinced that coincidence is simply attractor energy working in my favor!<br /><br />I am definitely more aligned with our universal creative source, through which all life comes into being, after watching this movie. I am a very spiritual person in general but I am further enlightened after connecting with these teachers of the secret, James Ray in particular. I have never felt so much gratitude, joy, peace, and happiness as I do today! This movie is an ablolute must!.<br /><br />Dr. Matthew J.

0060516402|4.0|Read this book and enjoyed it.  Like many management books, it does a good job of packaging common sense, but I suppose distilling information into bite-size chapters is valuable. <br /> <br />The book has entered the lexicon of Corp America and management consultants a bit too much, but overall, it's worth the read.
B000BJ7BCK|1.0|What a piece of trash. I had to suffer this forgettable flick in a bus trip and it is beyond my comprehension why and how a studio would spend so much money in that. It is silly, cheesy, and one had to lack any wit to like this. Simply a dog of a movie.
