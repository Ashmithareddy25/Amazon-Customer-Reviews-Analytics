B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read the third book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy hoping for a more interesting plot and less sex. The plot is sex, a little drama, make-up sex, repeat. Ana Steele is no Lisbeth Salander. E. L. James has a delightful vocabulary and timely sence of humor. Wish she would use her writing skills on a more intriguing subject matter.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|In tough times never forget who you are.  Maintain your virtues, your values, your honor.  Excellent movie!  This movie has great character development.
0525953728|5.0|First of all I want to thank the author for his service!  I have only just received the book and I am just starting to read it.  I am only one chapter in and I am completely sucked in by the book and my adrenaline is rushing already in the first chapter.  I whole heartily look forward to finishing the book and I am proud to be an American and I am glad people stand up and write accounts like this.<br /><br />An update to my review.  Something I never mentioned is that I am a disabled veteran and I truly appreciate \\"Mark Owen\\" for standing up and writing this book.  I set a new personal record by reading this entire book in about 30 hours.  It is such a compelling story that I found myself not being able to put the book down, and that is saying a lot from someone who barely reads books at all.  It is definitely a must read for anyone interested in History, or even just for anyone who wants to read a very compelling non fiction story that wants to know what life is like as a member of the Navy SEALS.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  Great Job \\"Mark Owen\\"!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I was suck into the 50 Shades whirlwind by a colleague. She mentioned the book at work which then led on to a big debate between the ones who liked it and the ones who didn't. Apparently my colleague was gifted the book by her daughter-in-law. How about that!<br /><br />Anyhoo, out of curiosity I bought myself 50 Shades of Grey. As I went along, I got intrigued - by the plot, the whole dom-sub equation & Christian Grey of course! The sex was exciting to read as well. By the end of the book I had to figure Christian Grey out! So I bought myself 50 Shades Darker. I just finished this book and I can tell you, I am not reading 50 Shades Freed!<br /><br />Why? Firstly because there is only so much one can read about sex! I personally don't mind reading detailed sexual escapades as long as they are well structured and strategically placed with the aim to entice the reader. But when you start reading about it every time they do it - which apparently is at dawn, morning, noon, pre-evening, evening, night & midnight - it just becomes too much! And it also makes you question - IS THAT POSSIBLE?<br /><br />Secondly, two people who just met, like 2 weeks ago, fall in love and decide to get married. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Now it can happen, but not for a character like Christian Grey. I just can't begin to fathom how a complex character like his could act that way. And don't get me started on Anastasia Steele. The woman is crazy! Period!<br /><br />The style of writing, the repeated use of words and expression is not what bothers me when reading this book. What bothers me is that Christian & Ana's actions and reactions contradict the personalities that the author has tried to depict.<br /><br />So people, I am out of this whirlwind. But I will confess, I do plan on watching the movie. I just HAVE TO see Christian Grey on screen! :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Once I started reading I could not put it down. A book that you want never to end. Made me laugh and feel every pain and joy the author had wrote about.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|This movie is so funny! I think us parents may have laughed even more than the kids! Perfect for the whole family! Allllvvviiiinnnnnn!!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows!  It has incredible footage!  The animation seems so realistic, like I'm there with them.  I watch this movie every year around the Christmas season and decided to purchase my own copy.  That way I can watch whenever I want!  It makes me laugh, it makes me cry and it makes me feel good all over!!!  Love, Love, Love it!  If you don't have your own copy or have never seen it, this is a must have movie!  Enjoy
B0049J3QNG|5.0|My family loves this movie! A timeless animated film. Prefect for the whole family. A great sequel to Toy Story with even more characters added.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I changed my mind several times during this book.  Very well done!  I have passed it around the neighborhood and may use it for next year's Book Club even though most will have read it already.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Such a fantastic movie to add to the Disney Pixar collection. A great choice for the whole family providing many laughs! Anyone can cook!
B008ASLQZW|1.0|This movie looked like it was on a low budget.  Watch the first one, better story better graphics.  No need to watch this movie
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|As a family this movie is one of our favorite! Absolutely hilarious, providing many belly laughs for everyone, young and old! Highly recommend!!!! One of the best movies of all time!!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This movie does a great job bringing to life the heart-stopping action of the book!! I'd recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12. Littler children might have a problem with the violence.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Movie was great but then I read the book which is even better.  Highly recommend reading the book if you have not.
B003YV0A02|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it many times  the quality of the movie was great I watched it using my roku player and the picture and sound quality was excellent
B002VXGW2E|5.0|i have enjoyed this film ever since it was released and finally bit the dust and bought it!<br />i enjoy it every time i watch it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Download was easy, the playback was a bit off but not overly obnoxious (computer related I'm sure).  It was worth the money to be able to catch up on the action prior to season 5.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was an amazing book!  I couldn't put it down.  I'd read at lunch and between client meetings!  Can't wait to read other Gillian Flynn books!
0525953728|5.0|Easy to read , tell the true, informative as well ( because I didn't know the true before ..)<br />For a military perspective ( seals ) is a no go book and I can  understand....<br />But for a civilian like myself I can only say thank you ... for sharing with us the true about the raid and your seal experience.<br />Matt ....this is a NO easy Book you know that but many people out there are so happy about the result of that mission ..about yourself and your team....all.<br />You will remain a navy seal team six chief for the rest of your life.
B003XDZLTG|2.0|love crocs, love the invention... great comfort,BUT be careful!! I order my true size and have to cut off the back strap, it make your foot go to the front and touch the front of the shoe... very uncomfortable, without the back strap, they where good but look awful...you're wondering why i don't order a size up ?... I did ! and its too big..I am in between sizes in this style, what a sad thing.
B00846REIS|5.0|Not sure what it is about billionaires and their love stories....but I loved it!  Great story.  Can't wait for book #2!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I began watching this movie knowing that it probably wouldn't appeal to me because I'm a senior.  Imagine my surprise when I was absolutely glued to the TV!  The actors were perfect for their roles, and I became very interested in the story.  In fact, I am so interested in the story that I can't wait for the second movie to come out.....I am buying the book so I can find out what happens next!  I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Streamed this movie first day it came out, I already watched in theatre but was worth watching again.  This movie followed the book pretty well, but as in most cases just does not go as deep as the book did.  However, it is still a good movie.
0525953728|1.0|Some people have said osama was already dead if that is the case then this author just wrote a book about a lie the goverment told.  If this is the case Im glad he is making money.  If this book is true than he is a traitor.  I defended him before I read the book.  Now I think hes a disgrace.  Im donating $26 dollars to the seal foundation.  Yes twice the amount i wasted on it.  Everyone should do this so the TRUE SILENT HONORABLE HEROES BENEFIT. GOD BLESS ALL WHO HAVE FALLEN FOR OUR WONDERFUL COUNTRY<br /><br />Military knows<br /><br />Norwich University
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought it was a bit predictable as to the outcome.  It was obvious that she would have an influence on him but I didn't see the ending coming.  I would recommend it to other readers.  Sometimes I think we just need to read books that make us feel good about ourselves and this book did it for me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ending of this book is a real downer after a very exciting first part of the book.  Liked the idea of alternating chapters by him and her.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I never thought is like a book so much!! It's great!! Must read!! I couldn't put it down! My husband wasn't disappointed with the outcome either!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First thing first for me to even read a whole book to completion is great so one star for that but over all it's not a bad book but kind of boring a little to much sex an not enough other things going on. I was waiting to read something exciting to happen. I guess I would get what I'm looking for in the other two books but I'm not in any hurry to purchase those if they are like book one..
B0079J27SS|3.0|These are the recordings I grew up with in splendid Angel Records sound.  There is something luminescent in the New Philharmonia Orchestra under Klemperer's baton.  These recordings deserve the red carpet treatment in preservation.<br /><br />So I have to wonder what planet are the Abbey Road engineers living on?  The liner notes boast that \\"In order to have the best digital remastering tools at our disposal for the remastering, we transfer from analogue to the digital domain at 96 KHz and 24-bit resolution\\".  Ten years after the Rolling Stones released their 1960s recordings on 2.8 MHz Direct Stream Digital format (DSD), the Beatles' recording studio is using 1990s digital resolution for these priceless glorious recordings.  Since the engineers wanted to do equalization and sometimes noise reduction, DSD might not be as appropriate.  However, if they truly wanted the best the would use 352.8 KHz 24-bit DXD, with 3.7 x the resolution.  DXD is now being used to master even CDs for goodness sake (e.g. [[ASIN:B003OCM3U6 Autumn Yearning Fantasia (DXD Master)]]).  EMI's use of 1/4 the available digital resolution is inexplicable.  And a tragic loss for posterity if these tapes decay without ever getting a high resolution digital copy.
B000W1SSV0|5.0|This album has been a favorite of mine since it first came out in the 60s.  My original vinyl got lost in the shuffle somewhere so it is a joy to bring it into my life again.<br />The songs and the delivery are timeless.  It's a thrill to hear the \\"originals\\" after so many interpretations through the years by so many varied and excellent artists, and<br />to still be thrilled with the freshness.  It's like coming home.  Getz & Byrd set incredibly high standards of musicianship and interpretation of this wonderful genre.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you like a thriller, you will like this book. It was a page-turner. You have a love/hate relationship with the characters. And the surprises come at just the right time.  Good read. Good book.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This is the second book I read by Kate Morton.  I decided to read it because I really liked the first one I read (The Forgotten Garden.) Well, I liked this one even better.  There are generational relationships explored, mystery and romance, need I say more?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, not yet having read the book.<br /><br />I knew it was going to be good, but what a pleasant surprise to find it great!<br /><br />A wonderful experience.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This CD is easily worth a buy! A slightly new driection has definately paid off with a much Darker feel.<br />Tracks 2, 3 and 5 in particular are awesome when driving or training in the gym ;)!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Its been a long time since a really good scary movie. Could not watch alone !! Each actor is excellent. Don't miss.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A great read, better than the Girl Who Played With Fire, it's just a shame there won't be any more, I think Lisbeth Salander is the most unusual heroine that I have had in a book in years
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun game - I haven't played much yet but it's starting to require some strategy to direct the water.  I think it is worth the money.  Plus... Agent P is awesome.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|This is a very good album that stands up well when compared to their first.  If you're a fan, you'll probably like this!
B00136Q1I0|5.0|Bruce is one of the all time greatest performers around and he shows it here...again.  I continue to admire his skill
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The author did an amazing job describing the emotions of Katniss to the point where you felt how Katniss felt. Go ahead and buy this book, you won't be disappointed.
B008M36EEI|2.0|This is nothing like Slum Dog Millionaire, and that's a disappointment from the first scene to the last. Even though it is intended to be a much more intimate and nuanced movie, it never stirs the viewer's emotions enough to achieve \\"suspension of disbelief\\" since it is so utterly unbelievable. That is a shame for the cast, who try mightily to reach the audience. But, this movie fails with terminal cuteness. I don't think that even a thirteen year old could find its silliness engaging. Sometimes you can just try too hard.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Best action pysc flick out there no question.I suggest this for anyone who is willing to look beyond thier little world.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a Twilight-type romance for adults.  I am a huge Twilight fan, but I think this is better written and more easily relatable for an adult.  The characters are more fully realized and believable (which is saying something for a centuries old vampire).  It is certainly one of the best fantasy/romance books I have read.
B007MGWBU2|2.0|We expected the movie to funny. There were parts but not as many as we had heard. It would have been better if it we set at the theater the whole time with shows like the tv show.
B007STBUIW|5.0|What else can I say that hasn't already been said about Jaws? Over the years, this movie became my #1 favorite movie of all time, supplanting Star Wars.<br /><br />If you only ever saw Jaws when you were younger and still think it is simply a summer blockbuster action/horror movie with no depth to it, then I urge you to revisit the film with an adult mind. The performances in this film are top notch. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and especially Robert Shaw expertly bring their characters to vivid life.  There's more going on underneath the surface of this movie than simply a shark terrorizing a resort town. I won't bore you to tears with my thoughts but suffice to say, this movie is an interesting look at the intricate relationships that form between people living in a small town, and specifically the relationship that grows between the three main characters as they embark on a mission against a \\"remorseless eating machine\\" that tests them to their very cores.<br /><br />The Blu Ray video is excellent and the sound is top notch. I would highly recommend upgrading to the Blu Ray for the documentary \\"The Shark Is Still Working\\", which is included in this package. Narrated by Scheider, it provides an in-depth look into the trials and tribulations of the making of the film and how Spielberg turned what could have been a complete disaster into a masterpiece.
B000W0B0KM|5.0|I have just gotten into thrash for about a year now.  I love the old Metallica and most of what Megadeth has done but this album blows anything those two bands have done out of the water.  Every song is relentless and every instrument is audible. If you love thrash, this album is for you.  If you are just getting into thrash, this album will seal the deal.  It's a shame music like this is not made anymore today.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was compelled to read Mockingjay since I had read the previous 2 stories in the trilogy. I have to say that I was quite bored with it. The only thing that kept me in it was because I did need to know how it ended. I found it to be very redundant. Too much of the same thing over and over and after a while I just felt that the story line was cluttered.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|My favorite show!  I'm not a TV kinda woman, but SOA has me hooked!!!!  The only TV show I will tape if I can't be home or up to watch it.<br /><br />Jax Teller charactr is sexy as hell... As he is in real life, I might add. Let's not forget the beautiful blue eyes and captivating smile of Tig, played by Kim Coates, if he weren't married......  Lol!  Ya right, in my dreams!  Lol!  (If you are ever looking for a woman to play his (Tig) love interest, I'm up for an audition!!!!  :). Blonde, green eyed italain.) :)<br /><br />Seriously, If you haven't seen this series, I recommend you start, its a must see!
B007R21JJK|1.0|This board lasted just 2 months before expiring completely, with no graphics being displayed on the monitor. Gigabyte gave no help to resolving the problem. This is the first time I've used a Gigabyte board in a computer build, and the first time I've had a board fail. The on board graphics on this board are slow compared to some of the other boards available from different manufactures. Replaced with an MSI board, which has a much better graphics performance than the Gigabyte board. In short faulty product and no support at all from Gigabyte, I shall be avoiding Gigabyte products in the future.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the final book to have a satisfying end.  Heart-wrenching, true, since the main character of Katniss Everdeen goes through hell and back emotionally and physically, but we finally arrive at a conclusion which wraps up many of the loose ends and more.  Looking forward to seeing this on the big screen.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|Update to the Update: If anyone is having Amazon compatible issues with some apps, you can go to the Play store and get the same app and it still works on your device. To Amazon's credit, they did issue me a full refund and I used it to purchase this App from the Play store and install it. Thanks Amazon for your awesome customer service!<br /><br />Update:  Since Amazon can not, or will not, fix the compatibility issues I'm having, I'm reducing my rating of this product to one star. I've contacted the developer and he assures me my device is compatible, but yet he nor Amazon has solved the issue here.<br /><br />I love this app... it works great on my cell, and until three days ago, it was compatible for my motto Xoom.  I noticed the version on my Xoom was not current with the latest update for my phone, so I did as usual when this happens... I un-installed the app and then went to the app store to reinstall it.  To my surprise, the app store now says that it is not compatible with my Xoom!!!  It seems that Amazon can't solve this issue so I hope the developer reads this and can.  There is no, at least to my untrained eye, a place to directly correspond with the developer. Again, this is an awesome app and I hope I can get it to work again on my Xoom, as I really hate to change to another program.  If this can't get resolved, I will change my five stars to one.  Sorry, but that is how business works in the real world.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this entire series. Easy to read and enjoyable. Wish there were more books to this series, I did not want to put it down.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hunger games was an excellent movie.  Enjoyed it tremendously. Will watch it again and I don't watch many movies more than once.
B007P3TMW2|4.0|Parts of this movie were a bit....the only word I can come up with is pretentious, but otherwise it was very good.  The young actor (sorry I don't know his name) was very good in this, and will have a very long career.  Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were very good as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book. Very intense. Sucks you in and you can't let go! Great descriptions, makes you feel like you are there.
1400069289|5.0|This book really tells it all when it comes to our habits. A must read for<br />anyone involved in making changes in their life and community and societies.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|My VCR broke down, so I needed a digital replacement.  Harold and Maude is one of the greatest Romantic Comedies (eased-out of the top spot by only Groundhog Day).
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am in the middle of this book right now.  So far, I am loving it as much as I did the first one. You can never anticipate where the story going.  Always a surprise.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Hunger Games on Blu-Ray with bonus digital copy is amazing!  It was great to add this to my iPhone so I can watch on the go!  The movie is fantastic and one that you can watch more than once.  It stays true to the book which is exciting!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was great!!!!  So many twist and turns I never saw coming... I am going to read all her other books now.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I just wasn't captured the way I thought I would be.  I would give the author 10 stars for his service but only 3 for his writing style.  Sorry, I was a little disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you can suspend belief for a little while, this book will keep you engaged.  It is a page turner with twists and turns that will keep you guessing.  If you are looking for entertaining fiction, read this book.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Probably my favorite of the Marvels. Definitely worth seeing - I would also highly recommend watching this before you see The Avengers - it adds to a lot of the back story for that movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love the series and can't wait for the next. Such an unpredictable storyline. Martin just keeps killing off my favorite characters and I'm always dying to see what happens next!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I had not read the books before seeing this film, so didn't know what to expect.  The premise is strange, and the violence is tough to watch, particularly because its children on children violence.  But if you are looking for a strong, intelligent, courageous, honorable heroine, you'll find it in this film.  What I like most about Katniss is that she wins by outsmarting the creators of the game.  Her character is such a nice change from all the Bella-like characters out there.  A WAY better role model for young women.  Loved it!
B008602KQI|4.0|The film was good, the book was better.  I enjoyed the creation of the dress, the scencry and all the characters.  The cast was great.  Hope that the second and third movies are as good
B0014KFV6I|1.0|I love the album, but I am unable to download it from iTunes to my IPod. I will have to pay $40 (my warranty is up), to get Apple to tell me what the problem is. Consequently, this purchase was pointless.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|If you have read and liked the first one you need to read this one. It only gets better from here not to mention it answers a lot of questions from the first book. Its a page turner. There are some grammar issues in this book as well. But over all its just as good as the first one. I would recommend reading all three books.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love how I received the Blu- ray in 2 days after my purchase. The digital copy is an awesome bonus. I do have a request to add subtitles on the digital copy. It was the best deal ever!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I an so hoping the the author writes another book I loved them all. I laughed I cried and rejoiced with the characters. Good job
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We were entertained and engrossed from beginning to end. The acting was superb, the characters were real and endearing (or not - the bad guys were just so, so bad!), the costumes and scenery were amazing. We really couldn't wait to watch the next episode. We are so ready for Season 3!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I really liked this pack for the first few month[[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories (Black)]]s using just around the house and for short day trips.  We just got back from our first two week vacation (day hikes - nothing big) and it is shredding along the seam of one of the shoulder straps.  It won't last another vacation! I am very disappointed and will contact Amazon to see if it can be returned! Didn't last quite one year with very little usage - have to assume it's a piece of junk!<br /><br />OK, this is an update.  Amazon took back the shredded pack and sent a brand new one.  No questions, no hassle.  I sincerely hope the new one will last longer - I'll keep you posted. I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars.  If it last longer it will probably go to five stars!
B00136JPB0|5.0|This is a moving album, from start to finish the album goes on an emotional journey. Another great artist whose music ended to soon
B0060D10I2|4.0|The visuals are great, and the acting is very good as well.  Helen Bonham Carter's Red Queen could be a cult classic.  The Cheshire cat is also one of my new favorite characters.  The story is a bit weak, especially since Alice is \\"rebelling\\" against fate except at the end she does fulfill her destiny in Wonderland.  Then in real life she doesn't, and instead becomes a British merchant in Asia, which is effectively like becoming a colonist.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|On the whole, the process was simple step by step - although of course this meant Work, with the reformatting since my book was already written. But I did discover a few things about Word that I did not know, I also now have what I need for future reference, and the fact that it was a free, smooth download was All bonus! Thumbs UP!
B0026FJT22|5.0|all episodes of Breaking Bad are excellent. very addicting you will not be able to not watch. I dare you
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I discovered the EP a few days ago, then was surprised when a friend told me the album came out. For $5, how can you not buy it? It's a great album, I love the style. If you own the EP, there are the same tracks plus more, but it's still a great deal and it's on repeat for me now.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A book revealing details and perspective of Scripture and much more. Should be on every open minded religious and atheist bucket list of must read books.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love that I can use this on my kindle fire but most the time is has an error and I have to force close it. then there are times it wont let me open it at all. needs some work.
0525953728|1.0|This Book should not have been written<br />poor taste and judgement.. really compromising our country's security<br />seems like these days its all about making money<br />and above all disrespecting our Commander in Chief<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my money here
B001H69D9K|5.0|In this wonderful recording from Ronnie Scott's jazz club, released in 2008, Jeff Beck delivers an absolutely definitive demonstration of guitar techniques coupled with a remarkable level of musical and sonic imagination. There are many fine guitarists on the world stage but few can match Beck's equal mastery of so many varied and differing genres including blues, rock, jazz, soul, funk, reggae and Asian influences - and all heard to perfection on this inspired night.<br /><br />The four-piece band features the outstanding talents of Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and the new sensation on bass, the talented young Tal Wilkenfield from Australia. The Stevie Wonder 'Cause we've ended as lovers' is a good track to sample the multi-talented line-up, but every track is a winner in its own way.<br /><br />The guest artists, Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton all make valuable contributions and there is a very enjoyable extended extra bonus with 7 items featuring the opening set played by the Rockability Band who all happened to be in London at the time and who reprise an earlier disc which had never before been played 'live'.<br /><br />Eagle Rock has provided a recording with involving camera work with crisp imaging. The sound is presented in excellent  DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo.<br /><br />This will give enormous pleasure to anyone to whom the program appeals and is a perfect example of Jeff Beck at the very top of his considerable game. For such purchasers this will be an unmissable 5 star issue.
B007AQIZNG|5.0|These guys are just the absolute best!  I'm so hooked on their exploits that it is almost cultist.  The dynamic between the 2 is so raw & always on the verge of \\"going there\\" but never does.  I'm so looking forward to season 8.  I want to grow old w/ Sam & Dean & Castiel.
B008602KQI|5.0|I lusten to the audio books, saw the movie in the theater and loved it. As soon as I got home I signed up to be notified when it was ready for pre order. I ordered the blu-ray for myself and the regular DVD for a friend who love the movie too. You must see this movie. It does start out slow but it gets better Just like the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is written in the point of view of the two major characters. It is very well written and it keeps you on your toes, a real page turner!!  You end up feeling remorse, anger, sympathy for each main character even when you know the truth!  I really enjoyed it!
B005GG0MIS|3.0|This book is a fascinating read, but gets carried away with detail, sometimes resulting in redundancy that is boring.  Could it have been shorter?  It always makes one wonder if the editors actually read the whole thing themselves!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E.L. James does not disappoint in book 2! She delves further into Fifty Shades background and reveals more about his childhood. There are twists and turns everywhere that keeps you reading. I love the book. Aside from all the sexual encounters there is a story there! I finished this book quickly and now I'm reading the final book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the book, the whole series is awesome, can't put it down. Just sorry that it won't let me share this book or any book in this series on my Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay started out as a hit with young people. Mockingjay is a fitting conclusion to the three part series. The Hunter Games Trilogy is a parable of what could happen in a time of total government dependance and power. Katness never bends to the evil a totalitarian government.Great read for all ages.
B0085776BG|4.0|Red Tails is a movie based on a historical group of African-American pilots that overcame the odds.  The dogfight and plane choreography are fantastic throughout the film, with incredible effects and masterful suspense.<br /><br />The main criticism I have of the film is that sometimes the characters fall into some simple roles, with Cuba Gooding acting like an understudy of Douglas MacArthur, a captain that struggles with drink, a young pilot struggling for acceptance by his peers, and the hotshot gloryhound that has to do some growing up.<br /><br />However, Terrence Howard is superb as the leading Colonel, and the film adequately conveys the suspense and risks of the fighters, ultimately leading to triumph over both the Nazis and the prejudice of other soldiers at home and abroad.  In the positive feelings and victories, the movie hearkens back to war movies of the WWII period.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the story, both in novel and movie form. The acting was brilliant, the portrayal of Panem was precisely how I envisioned it. The casting was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence was a convincing Katniss.<br /><br />Many people hate the idea of the main plot; young people matched up to do perform in a battle to the death. Great! I can't stand the idea myself, but it is the context of the plot that makes it good. Controversy is what makes a story good. You don't want any of it to happen. The \\"good guys\\" in the story don't want it to happen. That's what draws you to the main characters!<br /><br />It is a very emotional story, and you can't look away for an instant because you will miss something important.<br /><br />As for the actual blu ray I preordered from Amazon, I haven't looked over the special features yet. But when I get the time, I will.<br /><br />The best thing about this purchase is that I got an HD digital copy added to my Amazon Instant Video library - for free! I can basically watch it anywhere with my laptop!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Every season gets better. The guest stars are dynamic and fit right in as people with dark passengers.<br /><br />The end of the season story leaves many options for Season 7.
B00122RFOO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00122RFOO Moondance]]<br />I believe this to be one of his most listen to selections of his musical genius. I myself have been listing to this particulate collection since the early '70s and still find it vibrant and always worth listening. If memories are built on sight, sounds and smells. Then, the sounds of van Morrison create an avalanche of memories.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I had to find out what happends next to Anastasia.  I think book 2  better than book 1 of the Trilogy. Definately 2 thumbs up!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have had NOTHING but trouble with this book. The  pages aren't stable, they just continue to run as I try to read them, I have attempted to return to exchange but because I didn' check it the 1st week I had it there is no way to return. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Its a simple game based on a simple concept... but trying to complete the missions and to pick up random fun upgrades increases the replay-ability dramatically and has kept me addicted.<br /><br />If there was more variety in the levels and if more of the upgrades had a stronger effects (or any effect at all) I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, fantastic game
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I put off purchasing this book for months despite Amazon's repeated recommendation because the idea of love as a disease sounded like a wishy washy romance novel. While there is certainly a love story involved, when I finally caved and bought it, I really loved the story. I read it and the sequel and am anxiously awaiting the next book! If you aren't sure, try the sample.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was an adventure from beginning to end..It is not something that might not happen in this world. The action was great..
B000Q79HTC|5.0|I bought this to replace a copy I lost, I have the trilogy agin, \\"Identity\\" is alittle sloe moving a first but witin the context of all three its's the ground work.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well its not a bad flix.  My kids have watched it 100 times so for me its a 4 star
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is timeless with its pervasive interplay of marital banter. It is biblical in nature, defining the never ending growth and demise of marriage and friendships. I rarely read books about relationships, but this one is unique in its complexity and ever changing rules of behavior. A fascinating read<br />for all adults of any age. I am an 81 year old divorced male and loved every page of this adventure.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is riviting from the beginning. It holds the viewers attention and is a surprise at every turn. Not so unlikely for our future . Good movie.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Requires more suspension of disbelief than Ender's Game. Much more philosophical. I stuck with it despite some doubts in the first few chapters. It was well worth it. I found myself tearing up at the end.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie!!Its super cute and perfect for the whole family. Cant wait for number 2 to come out!
B001F7MSFM|4.0|I picked up this movie because I'm a big Hellboy fan, and I had picked up the orginal movie and wanted the set.<br /><br />To be honest, I like Hellboy 1 better as a complete package.  I think the writing is weaker in Hellboy 2, and the director made the odd choice of shooting Ron Perlman like any of the other actors instead of from low angles, as he did in the previous movie.  It meant that Hellboy no longer looked huge and 7' tall, and in a couple of scenes where he takes his coat off, his head looks oversized and his body comparatively normal human proportions.  I found these things disappointing.<br /><br />On the up side, however, the villain in this movie, Prince Nuada (played by Luke Goss), is amazing, and worth the price of the movie all by himself.  He looks stunning, and the scenes where he displays his martial skills are lyrical and a pure pleasure to watch.  He is also an excellent actor, and steals every scene where he appears.<br /><br />I should mention, too, that the Golden Army itself is beautifully realized, and the sets and the various arcane objects that Hellboy interacts with are also.  Just watching some of the scenes unfold is a treat for the eyes, and Mike Mignola's involvement in the production comes across very clearly.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I have read the books and as one could expect the movie doesn't follow the book 100%, but it still does a pretty fine job and I felt the movie alone was well made.  Would recommend to anyone whether or not they've read the books or not.
0345525558|5.0|I don't let many books keep me up past my bedtime (usually 10pm), but last night I finished this one at 12:35am, having been unable for more than two hours to bring myself to turn off the light...just had to see how it played out. Some reviewers have expressed difficulty with the way the book ends, and I confess that I felt everything was tied into too nice a bow, too easily, but that doesn't stop me from giving it 5 stars...as I do with any book that pulls me through the story the way this one did. I espcially liked the portrayal of Victoria's first few weeks with \\"the baby\\" (which did not at this point have a name)...I, too, have experienced what she did when I felt I was being consumed by a newborn. I was disappointed with how she handled her fear of motherhood, but ultimately believed that she did what she had to do. This book is about how to ameliorate guilt and grief when we feel we've done something unforgivable, and Diffenbaugh handles that theme well.<br /><br />A big bouquet of bellflower, oregano, and heliotrope to you, Vanessa.
B004TSXUWY|3.0|The story was a bit tedious and repetitive; I finished the book only because I don't like to start something and then leave it unread.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like that the game uses minimum moves not time clock to win hints, which i had to use several times. it even gives a won hint when u use hints. good variety in the levels and not so hard it gets frustrating.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book, really quick read. Well written, couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Rare to find a book I REALLY enjoy- this one definitely was a good one!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I don't care for mindless junk, and if you are reading reviews, you probably don't either.  It's fast-paced, fun to watch, and far from boring.  I hope they keep up with this series, because this sequel was even better than the first.  It's pure fun, and getting caught up in their stylized version of Holmes and London is very entertaining.  You won't regret watching.  Just rent it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie.  The story line, the action, the characters all just captured me.  And as always, the quality of the physical product from Amazon was perfect.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I read this book concurrently with a book by Jim Holt about 'why there is something rather than nothing'. Both were heavy reading, but it was just what I was looking for.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't see the hype.  Slow moving, predictable and poorly written.  Not a fan! Probably will not bother with the other two.
B001NKI60W|2.0|This movie is definitely for the younger crowd and not for adult viewing. It is totally nonsensical and not wworth watching.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I just love James Taylor's Greatest Hits CD. It has all his best songs and its a nice change from all the new music out right now. Its a must for your music collection.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie stayed very true to the book, though in such a short time span I think it was hard to convey the kind of life Katniss and her family lived in District 12 and why the Games were so horrifying.  Overall, worth watching, and definitely worth reading.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I'm more of a white noise person. Some of the sounds are not the relaxing kind of sounds to me. They do have alot to choose from though.
B00846REIS|2.0|Yes, I read the entire book. However I should have realized from the cover alone how similar this was to Fifty Shades. The author was not even creative with the names of the main character EVA here and ANA in Fifty Shades. Please give us just a fuzz of distinction. In both books these main female characters literally fall on the floor of the devastatingly rich Dom's work place within the first chapter--it doesn't stop there either. I have had my designs copied before and felt the twinge of anger from the lack of creativity and laziness that others \\"cash\\" in upon. Here sadly, I feel the betrayal will be continued with her next novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Terrific site to get ideas for everything you can think of. Wedding, teaching, home decorating, cooking, DIY projects and more. Really great site!
B0082JYEEO|5.0|Another brilliant, unique, and eclectic album. I actually saw many of the songs on this album performed live when she came to Portland. And I can honestly say that Regina Spektor is a genuine artist and sounds just as good, if not better, in person. She is true. True to herself. True to her art. And true to her fans. If you enjoyed her previous albums, you will not be disappointed with this one. I dare say you will love it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was so lost on this book because It had a difference to it. I could not get a picture in my head about some parts because everything changed up so fast. But then the ending was so fabulous and it was a great way to end a series!
B0036T1RMM|5.0|Magnolia is a magnificent film by Director Paul Anderson.<br /><br />All the dreams of youth and the little hopes of middle age are woven together into a story<br /><br />about those who were sure that life would treat them better than it has or ever will.<br /><br />Jason Robards last film, a role that expanded Tom Cruise's skills as an actor, Julianne Moore reveals even more of her talent<br /><br />and William Macy gives one of his best performances, Jeremy Blackman plays the long suffering child prodigy as well as anyone has.<br /><br />A modern \\"Magnificent Ambersons\\".
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was great, but there were times when i thought to myself, it seemed to be going in circles and that it was drawn out. Then BAM! A twist is thrown at you! But All in all Im glad I read it. The ending was cool. I wish it would have went on that a little more, but hey Suzannes the pro not me right? Great book!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|This book is wonderful for all kids. It has a fire breathing dragon, a princess and yelling, what's not to like? The princess is smart and breaks the mold of the traditional happily ever after. It is well written and I love the themes. This is one of my sons favorite book and we read it often.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|Over the last 6 months I have become quite the fan of Stephanie Plum.  The books are an easy read and they make me laugh and there's the bit of romance. Diesel is an interesting character, but we have all the 'regulars' as well, which keeps me reading to the end.  Can't wait for the next adventure.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love this album! It is great for everything! Road trips, sitting on the deck tossing back a few, background music while doing homework- it doesn't matter. Easily one of the best albums to come out in the past couple years.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book has been so much fun to read and so practical.  It breaks down body language and limbic response with images and descriptions.  It does a great job of relating these behaviors to children if you're a parent, interpersonal relationships, and the most entertaining.. people in the media.  I am more aware of peoples body language than ever and I will probably re read this book a few times.  Highly recommended!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This was actually a pretty good movie. They kept all the key points from the book and if you are a fan of the books like I am, that is a MUST.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Based on the board game, you can now play Carcassonne anywhere - even when you're out of table/floor space! A 4-player game moves relatively quickly. It's a little easy to beat, but fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is easy to use.  There are a lot options.  You may have to try each one of them to find the best combination.  The audio quality is good, too.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|A bit predictable. Not the page-turner that The DaVinci Code was. It wasn't terrible, I just had it figured out too soon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was very intriging.  The writing style unique, and it kept my interest until the end. Lots of twists and turns.
B000VM9Z8K|1.0|This book followed the vow too much... Even down to the crappy ending.  I usually love her books but after just finishing the vow a few weeks ago this one was too close to that.  I would not recommend this to anyone who has read that.
B000TEPIQS|5.0|I have always loved her and this really shows her talent. The soothing sounds of Sia are mesmerizing. I listen to this while im on the train going to school and it totally allows me to zone out on her voice!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book keeps your interest at a peak - you don't want to put the book down.  The characters in this story of the South and slavery,are depicted in a very historical, true to life manner.  The reader is drawn to the characters and fears for their well-being.
B000TETLPC|5.0|this is a great album, every time I put it on i can't stop listening. It is disturbingly motivational for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire Hunger Games triology. All three books kept me going with cliff-hangers at the end of almost every chapter. I felt very invested in the books and in the final outcome. Each story was full of new things to imagine and new obstacles to overcome. I was also surprised at the amount of romance, which I liked :) Not too sappy or too vulgar ... just right; And never taking your sights off the main focus (the struggle between the districts and the Capitol). I was actually sad when I finished the last book, knowing there would not be another for me to read. I would recommend the entire triology to anyone. The book has action, adventure, drama, and romance. A great read all-around.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|After treating myself to a tablet for the kitchen to use for recipes (got it refurbished for a song!) I was worried I wouldn't be able to use my word docs on it - only pdf....but Documents to Go was the answer!  Plus, I normally take notes after making things - to \\"fine tune\\" what I'm doing.  This was a great price and once I figured out HOW to install it worked great!  I'm a total tablet newbie....
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was out of sight! Never thought I would enjoy this one. Especially since I never read the books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book. Very easy read and never a slow part. I would read this a second time. Very thought provoking.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was well written and there were twist and turns until the end. I would highly recommend the book. great summer read.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent movie and the easy ordering and fast shipping mad it even more so because I was wanting to watch this so badly!  Thanks !
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Every story rolls smoothly into the other on such a great timeline with unique narratives from people's point of view. I loved every bit of it.
0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist is one of the world's best selling novels and has been translated into more languages than any other book by a living author, according to Wikipedia. I think I understand why. The novel is full of hope and also acts as a spiritual self-help book. Paulo Coelho, born in Brazil, has led an interesting life. He was locked away in a mental institution by his parents because he wanted to be a writer; he dropped out of law school, became a hippie, experimented with drugs, became a songwriter, and went on a pilgrimage that changed his life. This pilgrimage, which led to his realization that though he wasn't yet living his dream, no doubt inspired him to write The Alchemist. It is an inspiring read, reminiscent in ways of the Tales of 1001 Arabian Nights. There is magical realism, fun adventure, and the conviction that if you really want to, you can achieve your dream. At the same time, Coelho's story seems more a vehicle for preaching his philosophy and sometimes grows tiring. In modern American culture, we are skeptical of what it means to live and achieve one's dreams, especially in the days of post-9/11. American novels like Steinbeck's The Pearl warns us of the possible consequences of achieving the American Dream, and in the daily scandals of young celebrities shown in gossip magazines and television, we find one such consequence. I admire Coelho for his conviction, but I also believe he treats the idea of chasing and achieving dreams too simplistically.<br /><br />Coelho's spirituality is very apparent through his language of Personal Legends and the Soul of the World. The boy will learn to speak through God, like the great prophets, and perhaps Coehlo is also serving as a prophet, instructing his readers how to lead their lives. I think Coelho is trying to say that anybody, through hard work and merit, has the ability to speak directly with God, and not just the chosen few, the prophets. This, perhaps, is what adds to its popularity. It is what made Christianity such a powerful religion. Rather than being for the elite few, Christianity spoke to the impoverished many. The problem, however, is that while Coelho seems to be preaching to the many, his story undermines this. Based on what the narrator says throughout the novel, it seems that only the elite few possess the ability to achieve their Personal Legend.<br /><br />This is apparent in the way the story is told as well. Only those who the king and the alchemist choose to explain the rules of Personal Legends to can actually achieve their dreams. This is also lazy storytelling. Every time the boy is consumed with doubt or faces an obstacle that threatens to turn him away, some powerful characer, like a genie from the Tales of 1001 Arabian Nights, enters the scene and tells him the right way to go. The boy would have never chased his dream had it not been for the appearance of the magical king, and he would have given up had it not been for the appearance of the alchemist. Coelho seems to believe that the world conspires to make our dreams come true, which is easy enough to argue in a novel with fantastic elements. Real life isn't so simple or easy, though.<br /><br />Coelho's narrator implies that those who do not achieve their dreams don't because of their own personal failings and fears. However, he fails take into account the twists and turns life takes. There's also the fact that our dreams change, and that they are not absolute convictions. Our dreams might change as we gain new perspectives on life, or they may not have been very clear to begin with, but always developing in our mind. And perhaps when we do take up that career, while our mind dreams of other things, we realize that this career fulfills us in ways we never imagined. And once you achieve your dream, you may likely face the question, is this what I really want? You may also begin to dream of something else. Dreams aren't so simple, after all.<br /><br />The Alchemist is not a boring read, and at times is very entertaining. I enjoy the stories from the 1001 Arabian Nights, and the novel is at its best when its adventure plays out like them. Theft, travel, war, sandstorms and love. Coelho is very inventive in the ways he makes use of what at first appears to be an obstacle to the boy's journey. However, the novel plays out largely as a philosophical work, and Coelho's idealism seems born from another age, an age of innocence. We have become realists and pessimists today. Of course, as a spiritual work, I believe the novel will play out differently for everyone. You might become a believer, and the novel may serve as a source of inspiration for you. Just because it doesn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for you.d at times is very entertaining.

0060557818|5.0|I've seen a trend in the two Gaiman novels I have read so far (and I have seen Stardust so I know it's true in that story as well) of parallel fantasy worlds concealed within the real world of London, and even the world as a whole. Those who reside in this fantasy world are very much aware of those in the real world, but those in the real world have no clue about the fantasy world, and if they do become aware of it, they cease to exist in the real world. This isn't entirely original, I know, and anybody can point to Harry Potter as another story that uses this trope, though some of the details are different, but Gaiman makes it feel fresh. He has very quickly become one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Gaiman writes with a good deal of wit and humor. He carefully unfolds new plot points to keep things interesting, and his characters are all well-developed. The villains, Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar, centuries old, provide humorous banter as well as suspense. They have an appetite for things inanimate as well as living. Richard's inability to cope with his new surroundings sets up some funny situations, but it also makes the reader sympathetic towards him. Door is a strong heroine, and one of those interesting ones. It seems too often that Hollywood equates strong women with action heroes, rather than strength in character, and in return any semblance of personality is gone. I take as a recent example the movie Mirror, Mirror, where Snow White becomes an excellent swordswoman, but she's a very dull character. Gaiman makes Door a strong heroine without sacrificing her personality or turning her into an action hero.<br /><br />In fact, Gaiman wisely avoids making this into an action extravaganza. Richard, Door, and the Marquis must use their wits rather than their muscle to defeat Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar, who have the ability to move with superhuman speed. How the story unfolds and resolves reveals Gaiman's superior sense of storytelling. Gaiman also uses his fantasy as social critique. London Below is reminiscent of impoverished areas in large cities of developed countries. The more fortunate of us prefer to pretend these areas simply don't exist. And in today's post-9/11 world the novel takes on new meanings as well, particularly in its conclusion. The film, The Hurt Locker, brings a new perspective to Gaiman's conclusion, and those familiar with it will know what I mean.<br /><br />Once you've entered this world, there's no going back.s his fantasy as social critique.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Having never heard of the book or the author previously, I was happy to have stumbled onto this intriguing title while looking for another book to download on my Kindle. The author has a wonderful way of describing the many interesting characters Harold meets on his journey. The way she brings the reader into Harold's pilgrimage is so well written that I felt as though I was the one caught in the icy rain with blisters on my feet! The book was a wonderful read - and the ending was totally unexpected and moving. Great job, Ms. Joyce!
0439023521|2.0|The Hunger Games is, technically, well-written, but its style is not very engaging. Katniss, as the narrative voice, is too apathetic. She doesn't show compassion towards others, except maybe her sister, and even that is evident only in her decision to take her place in the games. Her sole focus is in hunting and surviving. She's very narrow-minded. She never seems to consider the broader scope of the society she lives in. Human history provides many examples of people in harsh conditions who consider how to make life better not only for themselves but for others. Consider slavery. Frederick Douglass learned to read and write while enslaved, and escaping wasn't enough for him. He fought to free all of the slaves. Katniss instead chooses to tolerate her life and hope that neither she nor her sister get selected to participate in the games. It never once crosses her mind to try and do something proactive.<br /><br />Of course, readers of the novel understand that Collins is not endorsing a society that makes use of child violence for entertainment. I've heard and read many discussions of people saying how horrible the slaughter is, but this discussion does not happen within the novel. The viewpoints of the characters are not discussed, not even in the sense that many of us talk about the violence in our large cities. The problem with the violence is that it plays out more like a Hollywood action movie, which serves the goal of making it exciting rather than a condemnation of violence. These teenagers fight one another more like action heroes/villains and cold-blooded, experienced assassins than frightened, inexperienced teens. The novel's message would have been more effective had Collins instilled the sense of terror of battle, or a sense that these teenagers are being forced to kill when none of them want to. And with an exception of one character, the deaths are not seen as tragic, but as one less obstacle in the way of Katniss winning. In Howard Fast's The Hessian, grown men prepare to ambush a troop of Hessian soldiers. As they wait for the Hessians to arrive, they shiver with fear that they'll die. And when the ambush is an overwhelming success, they grow sick at the sight and smell of death. That level of humanity is missing here.<br /><br />What also struck me was the lack of emotion during the lottery process. Where are the mothers and fathers crying out in agony, fighting desperately for their children? Why aren't the teens themselves overwhelmed with fear? They all accept their fate like sheep. Nobody fights for their own survival, or the survival of loved ones. They simply accept their fates. This is why I included the Martin Luther King quote at the start of this review. The people of Panem accept a negative peace in order to avoid tension rather than a positive peace. I can't help but think of King's condemnation of those who silently watch and do nothing, believing that justice will prevail eventually but feeling no need to fight for it. The novel views Katniss as a strong female character, but she doesn't fight except when her own survival depends on it. To me that's cowardice. And it's short-sighted. She's no stronger than her mother because she's just as mute when it comes to her society. She would rather tolerate her life than fight to make it better for her and her people. Her only form of rebellion is to say, I refuse to have any children. That's good for her, but what about the generations to come?<br /><br />At one point in the novel, Gale wonders what would happen if everybody refused to watch the games. This is an interesting question, but it's the wrong one. The right question to ask would be, what if the tributes refused to fight?, grown men prepare to ambush a troop of Hessian soldiers.

This is an interesting question, but it's the wrong one. The right question to ask would be, what if the tributes refused to fight?
B003K16P3M|5.0|Fabulous read. What a great find. Very developed characters with a wonderful plot. I am very picky and this kept my untreated until the end. Left me wanting more.
0553386794|5.0|One word sums up this book: daunting. It is written from the perspectives of eight different characters. A majority of these, six to be precise, are members of the Stark family, holders of the northern realm of Winterfell in the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />Once the early introductions begin, the plot truly sets in motion, and it is filled with mystery and intrigue. At the end of each chapter you want to know what happens next. The final 200 pages or so are particularly good. This is where most of the action is, but the action is not boring, as it often tends to be in fantasy adventure stories. For one, Martin knows how to build up suspense, and he realizes the importance of letting the reader know what's at stake. Too many fantasy stories I've read are far too pleased with the fight scenes and grow annoyed with all of that other stuff, like character and story, but for Martin the action is perhaps the least important aspect. First he lets us get to know his characters, and then he lets us know why we should care about the action.<br /><br />This is not a fantasy story for the kids. Its massive length is one indication of this, but also its content. The violence can be very graphic, with lots of innards spilling out and blood pouring from wounds. There are also several sex scenes, mostly involving Dany and Khal Drogo. The themes, as a result, are much more mature than you would find in a Young Adult fantasy tale. Martin tackles the politics of power, introducing a huge host conflicting interests that make the game of thrones so complicated and impossible to predict. Characters make decisions that have dire consequences, though they seem the right thing to do at the time.<br /><br />The story plays out like the dramas of real historical games of thrones, and as such you will find that no character, no matter how much you love them, is safe from death. Several times I laughed, several times I felt saddened, and at other times I was angry with the novel's villains. Though using the word villains may oversimplify the story, particularly since we see things mostly from the perspective of the Starks. I don't know if it's so easy to say who is truly good and who is truly evil. Certainly some are more evil or more good than others. There are some characters who do a very good job of hiding where their true allegiance falls, and what their true intentions are. Ned Stark sets himself up as a good guy because his values place honor as the most important quality in a man. Where that gets him I will not say.<br /><br />In the end I say you should go and read this book. Grab it from your bookshelf, where you look at it daily, contemplating whether today is the day you will begin. No, you may not have a life until you finish it, but I guarantee you will enjoy your time with it. Of course, Martin sets up such enticing cliffhangers at the end that you might just dive into the next one, and the one after that, cursing the author for writing such an addiction.h using the word villains may oversimplify the story, particularly since we see things mostly from the perspective of the Starks.

B005IQZB14|3.0|An entertaining read but not very original.  The author is a little whiny, and why didn't she just get proper shoes?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was skeptical at first to read this but once I started I couldn't put it down.  It may be a bit much for some more conservative readers.  As soon as I finished the first I had to purchase the second right away and again the same with the third.  Definitely peaks your interest about some things that may be unmentionables in normal conversations.  Yes, there is a story and a very good one at that.  In my opinion, one of the series of books I've ever read.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I got my order, as described early. Which, I needed because my watch had died and I'm lost without it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|enjoyed greatly. the story line develeped well, cliff hangers kept us. some complete story also, would be difficult to start watching without starting at the begining of season one. im glad they will finish the story in the last season and not just stop unanswered.
B003YTN4S4|5.0|Amazon rocks!!! We have owned this movie many times, and the kids love to watch it all the time, but kids are not too kind to disks so they scratched and broke. Eventually we will convert all our films to Amazon instant. Kids cannot scratch what is in the cloud, after all. We love you Amazon, don't ever change. Because unlike all of our Blu-rays and DVD's, Amazon is not broken. Thanks for the solutions to my problems.

B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was good, the special effects were great and the casting of most of the characters was done well. I could have said the movie was great if not for the fact that I read the books first. Some important shortcuts were taken that gave the movie and character development a different feel than that of what one gets from the books. Lets hope that in the next movie the writers stick more to the original story line and not input their own line up. All-in-all thw movie is worth owning and certianly worth seeing.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Many of these reviews base their rating on the appropriateness of the book being written in the first place, how much a hero you regard the author to be, or the importance of the Bin Laden mission.  This review is not one of those; it's a look at the book itself, in the context of similar books.<br /><br />Before my review gets bashed, I'll preface by saying that I've read many SEAL and other SpecOps books and regard all of these guys as heroes who sacrificed much, sometime everything, to do a job for their country that mostly goes entirely unrecognized.  But my opinions of a guy's heroics have little to do with the quality of his book.<br /><br />This is not the first SEAL book to have been written, nor is it the first by a former Seal Team Six/DEVGRU member.  After reading it, I would not put it among the top tier of those books.  It suffers from what I see as a fatal attempt to balance several conflicting priorities in writing it.  All of these have to do with deciding how much detail to include or exclude.<br /><br />First, the security restrictions were an obvious (and oft-stated) concern of the author's, and, just as obviously, the cause of much of the ensuing controversy.  In my opinion, the author erred on the side of being overly cautious when describing his missions, though not as much in the Bin Laden raid.  The missions from his background are described in such generic terms that they could have conducted by any special ops personnel, anywhere.  After reading many of them, I was left wondering why most of them were included in the first place.  Yes, they were probably representative of his career, but most lacked drama in their telling and seemed perhaps overly breezy.  The author clearly did not wish to get into too many operational details for running afoul of the security censors, but we're left without the insider-type details that are so rich in other accounts.  It's the details that make a reader feel like he's really watching the boots on the ground, not just hearing a guy tell watered-down stories at the bar.  The Maersk Alabama incident is a good example.  The author was part of this high-profile mission, but the only new information we get was a small bit about the interrogation of the one captured pirate.  The rest was already covered in open news sources.  In my opinion, other (DOD-reviewed) books have gone into much greater detail, so I can't see what there is to complain about regarding security breaches.<br /><br />Secondly, despite some of the uproar from the SPECOPS community, the author seems overly humble in his book.  He comes across as the epitome of the \\"quiet professional\\" during his career.  He lives for the job, for his teammates, and being the best SEAL he can be - for the team.  It seems he advances through his accomplishments, not force of personality or politicking.  He deliberately limits his career to stay in an operational capacity and on those ops, he's either leading by example, or just a well-functioning cog in the machine.  But those impressions do him and the reader a disservice.  We like old-school heroes and this guy clearly had the \\"right stuff\\" but he'll never come out and say it.  He spends too little time being introspective about his role in the SEAL's successes and has an almost apologetic tone when including himself at all.  I really would have liked to get to know the guy better in his book, other than his penchant for telling bad jokes and his case of OCD.<br /><br />Thirdly, the book seems to be aimed at as broad of an audience as possible.  This is probably had as much to do with the lack of details as the security issues.  Either the author, co-author, or publisher seemed afraid to let the minute details into the book that give it the real air of verisimilitude.  Every once in a while we might get a brand name for a knife or his boots, but otherwise very little.  Some may argue that those details bog down the narrative, but the typical reader of military memoirs lives for that kind of stuff.  It's what allows the reader to live vicariously through the author's eyes.  Without those, the book could well have just been written by an informed journalist (such as the co-author), rather than a guy who lived and breathed this stuff for a decade, and for whom details were everything. Might that have turned off some of the mass audience who were otherwise drawn in by the Bin Laden angle?  Probably so, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />Finally, the biggest draw of the book was of course the Bin Laden raid (or UBL, as the book puts it).  The book clearly struggles to balance how much of the author's career to include as preface to the climactic raid.  In my opinion, there was not enough of the former.  Yes, many books have covered BUD/S training that sailors go through to become a SEAL, but each man's experience there was unique.  The author gave his time there the short shrift.  In other SEAL books, that time was critical to finding out what really motivated a man and what his strengths and weaknesses were.  In the author's case, he pithily describes his motivation as just getting to the next meal, a fear of failure, and always wanting to be a SEAL.  We get no sense of where he struggled or succeeded, other than a few mentions of his marksmanship.  Once he gets into his missions, many of them seem to be more typical recollections than really critical moments in his career.  That may be because they were breezily told so they lacked weight or significance beyond their military value.  It felt like prelude to the \\"good stuff\\" at the end, so I found myself hurrying to read through much of it, not because those sections were so grippingly told, but because I felt like I was waiting for the real story to start.  In the best of this type of book, I find myself racing to get to the end of a chapter to find out what happened in each mission.  Again, the first decade of his career (the UBL raid essentially ended it) felt unfairly glossed over atthe expense of the UBL raid.  I guess that was to be expected given the title.<br /><br />I came into the book with high expectations from reading similar titles, but these unbalanced priorities left me wanting more from all of the parts up to the Bin Laden mission.  Once he hits that part, though, things really took off.  The mission was told in much more detail than earlier operations, so you began to feel like you were down in the weeds with the SEALs.  The narrative was told suspensefully and with details that we haven't seen or heard before.  Those details, incidentally, became the focus of the security uproar, but seem to actually give little away in terms of tactics or operationally-sensitive information.  It seems more that the details differed from the official narrative and were thus uncomfortable for some in Washington.  I doubt many terrorists are gaining new insights from facts like the SEALs no longer land on top of a target, that they use military dogs, or have $65,000 night vision goggles.<br /><br />The Osama Bin Laden mission saves this book from being a (relatively) unremarkable entry in the genre of special operations memoirs.  The mission itself is a draw, regardless of how it's told, but the author manages to tell a great story about it.  It's unfortunate that a confluence of other factors weakened the earlier parts of the narrative. Given the title, I suppose I should expect the non-UBL-related parts to be de-emphasized.  I'm sure many lay readers will enjoy it and not notice what I found lacking, but the typical informed readership, I feel, is going to be disappointed.  I gave the book 3 stars because the first half (or more) was a letdown, while the end was outstanding.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|i use this a lot when sitting around doing nothing. it is good to keep your mind active. i have a couple of different apps of mahjong and like this one the best.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is the greatest book ever written. I am already almost done reading the second, and DYING because the third isn't finished yet! READ THIS BOOK.
B0011TMOIK|4.0|The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it would not stream in HD for some reason.  I switched to netflix and checked by streaming a movie on it and it seemed fine.  Other than that it is a great movie.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Very easy to buy and very easy to enjoy over and over again. My two girls love this movie. Will be buying more movies in the future like this.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|This was a great love story on how two people were helping each other out and not knowing it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I Never wrote a review about a book before. But for this book however, i have told everyone I know about how much i enjoyed this story. I thought it was very clever and very well written. I will be reading more books by this auther.
B00866H7SS|3.0|Another enjoyable story of lust, love and sex!! Very similar to Fifty Shades but heads off into its own storylines which kept me reading.  Looking forward to the second book.
B00899DV6O|5.0|Love it! Great variety in lyrics and sound! The music on this album can be enjoyed by all members of my family!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|At first I couldn't put the book down. It was the kind of situation that one always dreams of doing, rebelling against the accepted normal respectable way of life and doing something totally out of character and eccentric but for a very good reason and with a strong belief in what is right.<br />The last chapters were a little drawn out but still a very good book.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I rented this movie because it was .99 I figured I wanted to see it how could I lose? I really enjoyed this movie it was a lot of fun, the characters were great. Great movie.
B007URCTOG|5.0|The movie \\"The Vow\\" is about a man's vow to his wife for life.  When she loses her memory, he works at making her fall in love with him again.  Who wouldn't want to marry a guy like that?
B00821OX98|5.0|We streamed the movie on our TV with a [[ASIN:B007KEZMX4 Roku HD Streaming Player]]and watched episode after episode on a rainy weekend. It was very entertaining and high quality. It was suspenseful, and almost like watching a long movie!
B008CP92ZO|3.0|It's one of those movies that most of the funny parts you've already seen in the previews.  My husband and I both ended up falling asleep and didn't finish the movie.
B002OR0RP0|3.0|Entertaining movie for kids and a brain break for adults.<br />My grandson would have like this movie because of his love of animals and dinosaurs.<br />Also it has action, humor and is very colorful.
B004KA9VGA|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this as i thought it had all the elements to make an interesting read. However, i have actually given up on it about 2/3 way through. I feel that it's not going anywhere and that the characters are very weak.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|I just bought the one song, \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and it is a nice song, very enjoyable with a nice beat.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|My husband just loves this film. Whenever it was being shown on television you would find him watching it - again and again and again. Finally decided to just order him his own copy. Now he can watch it whenever he wants. He's happy...
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The price was good and quality was excellent. Also received the movie in two days was really glad. Was able to sit and watch this movie with my husband who would not go to the movie. He also enjoyed the movie,
B008ASLNN2|3.0|I thought the plot was a little incoherent, and it didn't have the same manic energy that propelled the first Sherlock movie to greatness. I think taking Sherlock out of London for a good part of the film hurt it - it feels like it lowered the stakes, instead of raising them (as it was clearly intended to do with a globally-focused antagonist). But it was still eminently watchable - hence the three stars.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book gave me an insight into the life of someone in a wheelchair and also on the persons right to die. Not saying I'm agreeing with it but definitely made me think about it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I really enjoy Philippa Gregory's style, giving the main character of her novel the voice of the story - it makes it more personal.  Ms. Gregory is an excellent writer, giving details pertinent to the character and story line, and repeating and rephrasing details when important to review, without seeming redundant.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! It has very large buttons and uses the whole screen. I use it all the time.
B0043RSJ8G|2.0|The book was not as big of a page turner. Putting in both gay and religious contiversial aspects was too much for the story. Was just trying to get through and I predicted the ending by chapter 4.
B002RI97IY|5.0|A must read for anyone looking for little moments of space in your life where it seems to make sense and you can feel joy coming within when there is nothing really happening without. It is in the simple things that you will notice it.<br />Gives great depth to the workings of the mind and all it's tricks!<br />This is my second time reading it and still it works to wake you up. I will definately read it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|I actually craved reading this book. Everyday I wanted to read more and more. Everything is perfect except for the author's lack of thesaurus.
0425263908|2.0|Not Original - A bad \\"Fifty Shades\\" knock off!<br />I was very disappointed with this book.  The author is clearly trying to ride of the success of Fifty Shades of Grey but there are way, way too many similarities with the characters!  The \\"biting of the lip\\", \\"Eva\\" vs \\"Ana\\", the \\"pants hanging on his hips\\", \\"how beautiful he is\\", \\"how he wants to control her\\", \\"how he always says mine\\", \\"the strikingly beautiful roommate - the fact that Eva has a roommate\\", even the way the term \\"sex\\" is used is the same and Gideon (what kind of name is that anyway??) just happens to be the successful owner of his own company too just as our beloved Christian!  The plot seems rushed at the beginning and then big bits of information just fall into the story from nowhere...who even said anything about being a \\"dominant\\" and who tells someone after a week their very sorted and private past of abuse??  I give this book two stars only because the \\"trysts\\" between Gideon and Eva were well written and excitable!  Needless to say, I will not be purchasing the next book - part II...let me guess this story will be a trilogy too!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book is very well written.  A book you can not put down.  What an intelligent, thoughtful writer. I will buy everything this author writes.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Mobile gaming still has a way to go in terms of keeping me entertained for more than just a few minutes.  But this game does exactly that.  It's a side-scrolling game with the simplest controls possible. Touch the screen & your main character goes up or down depending on the jetpack or gadget he happens to be in; collect coins, avoid obstacles, repeat.  Sounds simple and repetitive, and in a way, it is.  But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for even more than a few minutes at a time.  Being able to add different jetpacks or different perks (with in-game currency, not real money) keeps the game fresh.  There is a real currency purchase option, but the game never once prompts you to buy coins; you have to hunt and peck for that option.  All in all, a game I still find myself playing when I have a half hour or so to kill after a solid month of game play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Down load was a piece of cake, can't put it down. I am lost in the fight :), Really enjoy having my Kindle, it is a joy to read and so convenient!
B008EQIEWS|3.0|It was ok, nothing like the first one. Don't wast your time or money on this show. If you want to watch a good show just re-watch first one.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Heights is one of my all time favorite books. Having it available on the  Kindle is an added plus.  Bronte is an excellent author.
B007SGM084|1.0|Fifty Shades of \\"Stupid\\", poorly written, immature , out of order, repetitive ,  very difficult to finish. Not well written. Would not recommend, save your money!
B008EL4YX6|4.0|at first this looked like a typical kids game...but the further you got into the game, your mind really had to process all the visual possibilities to obtain the best \\"grade\\" for each level. I give it an \\"A\\". very stimulating, thinking game for all ages.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|I LOVE all things British and this was one to add to the list. A little cheesy and predictable but very clean and great cinematography.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great Book.. characters easy to fall in love with. I can't believe this type of book is so main stream. It was entertaining!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|My wife had. Ever seen this movie, thanks to amazon I was able to show her this IncredIble movie. I wish they could add a option for 48 hours.
B008602KQI|3.0|I've read all three books in the Hunger Games series.  This movie, although PG-13 worthy, could've been a little truer to the book.  How the mockingjay pin was acquired is a very essential element that was missed or misinterpreted in the movie. Not sure how they're going to omit those \\"elements\\" in the next two movies.  I find it interesting that most people I've talked with that have seen the movie and have not read the book(s) do not appreciate the underlying \\"anti-socialism\\" mood pervasive in the books.  Instead, they are horrified at the child to child combat.  Please read the books before you judge the rest of us!
B007SGM084|5.0|Spellbinding! Hard to resist - afterall variety is the spice of life!<br />Who wants Black and White when you can have more fun with Grey?!
B00122BEPA|5.0|This cd is awesome!!! All the remastered songs aren't jumpy or digital sounding like I was expecting. And its Van Halen!!! Can't get any better!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I liked this book at least as much as the first two, if not more. The third volume answers many questions that were left open in the first two books, so it really is a \\"must read\\".
B0070YDOT8|4.0|Good  games...except should give more free coins and maybe different slots.  New games would be nice.<br />Enjoy the video poker but would like more.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Hunger Game books and Suzanne Collins. When I heard that Gary Ross was directing the movie version, I had high hopes because of the quality of his previous films (such as Seabiscuit.) This filming of the book is generally very faithful. Inevitably, it leaves out some aspects (such as the mute slaves.) The casting is nearly ideal, with standout performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Henderson, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and Elizabeth Banks. But, the production, expensive as it was, seems to lose some of the grandeur that the book creates because of lack of resources. The initial reaping has too few applicants - it is, after all, the collective young people from a whole district which may have more than a million people. The riot scenes are all too obviously filmed close so that the poverty of extras isn't obvious. The views of the Capital are momentary instead of awe-inspiring. The design is excellent, but the implimenation seems to be too sparse. The hand-held camera is particularly annoying: close and shaky, it is supposed to suggest a documentary but seems all-too-obviously a ploy to distract from the small cast. Nevertheless, the human aspects come through very well, particularly given the very high level of artistry among the actors.<br /><br />I recommend this film.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book is very real addressing issues that a child with special needs may encounter and from the mind of the child to give the reader a first hand look at why they behave the way they may.  It also shows home and marriage flaws that make this story more relatable.  In the search for an answer to a dog murder mystery this young boy goes through many problems, finds some solutions and learns about himself as well as his relationship with his parents.  Great book!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Wonderfully written personal account of not only the \\"BUDS\\" training but an in depth look at the Special Ops mentality and code. As a veteran, I was moved by Marcus' account of the training, firefight, and his survival until rescued. I am very proud of this young man and all his brothers-in-arms and their combined sacrifice to this country.<br /><br />All in all it was a great read.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing track #1 on Sirius/XM Radio for a while. Then track #7, Run Free, started playing on Sirius and I said to myself, I have to check her entire cd out.  So I actually logged on Amazon intending to purchase another artist's cd and came across Rebecca's cd and once I listened I couldn't download it fast enough. I've been listening to it everyday since. Simply beautiful voice and awesome lyrics!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|this book was justs as good as the 1st one, if not better. it is captivating and there is so much mystery about what to expect next.....i cant wait to read book #3!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Maybe I'm too old for this (52), but the books get weaker from 1 to 3. Entertaining, but definitely meant for teens.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|A definite must read for any fantasy lover! It takes a little while to get going, but once you get into it there's no putting the book down.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|Evil Dead was always one of my favorite campy 80's horror flicks. To finally be able to see it on bluray is awesome. Even though bluray enhances alot of the aspects of older movies it didnt take away from this flick at all. It still has that old school quality that was special about scary movies from the 80's. Plus its the first time Bruce and Sam got together to start something that us geeks would always treasure.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|If you have a job you should read this book. It makes you look at complex tasks very differently and reminds you that you're not so smart. That's why you should read this book.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Without pretensions this movie has kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! The fighting sequences are the best of every movie I've seen, and the director didn't leave out any detail to make it seem absolutely real. Even after a big fight when someone got hurt, you could still see them on the screen in pain and you can hear their moans. Absolutely brilliant.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is great!! I was never really into romance before I read this book. The first time I looked at it, I didn't want to read it. But I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterward!! My favorite book of all time!!
B008602KQI|2.0|Unfortunately I read the books first and this movie was just boring and<br />it left too much out.  Did not follow the book that well.  I WASTED MY MONEY on<br />this movie.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I neglected this show since it's start, thinking it wouldn't be for me. Was I ever wrong. After watching one repeat on television, my cousin and I purchased all 5 seasons,and watched almost non-stop. Easily the best show on television. The cast is bright and hilarious, and it's a show I hope goes on forever.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This was a fun movie. My Grand daughter, her friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />It was action packed and kept our attention from beginning to end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Beyond the new type of book this is.... It has a story line that keeps you hooked beginning to end.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great read for any age.  A retired teacher had just read this and recommended this to me.  How we react to extreme deformity is examined from the viewpoint of the person with the deformity. Great discussion for young people who expect all to be perfect.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|A great sequel to Pillars of the Earth.A spellbinding, page turning adventure.You wont want to put it down. Engrossing till the end.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is a great looking functional app and it looks better than any other weather app that I have.  I love it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use and consistent with info; allows multiple locations with quick access. 5 stars if it had high/low for day on home screen.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|I read this book anticipating Hemingway's sparse, minimalist use of language, but I quickly became disenchanted with the style. It may have been innovative in its time, and such a sere but straightforward use of the language may be appropriate for other subjects (I'm thinking of The Old Man And The Sea), but in this instance I found it simply impoverished and, oddly, pedantic.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|These guys are RAD!! I kept hearing the It's Time song at work often and kind of dug it. then listened to other tracks on this album and I love bands that blend genres..these guys clearly do. Hard to pigenhole them. First track has a very Dubstep feel to it which I love, then next few tracks sound kinda Coldplay esque and then \\"Demons\\" just explodes...the beat sounds very familiar to \\"love the way you lie\\" by Rihanna and Eminem. Good live instruments combined with synths, electronica type feel in the background, some heavy bass snares in some tracks and some beautiful balad types, like \\"Every Night\\".<br /><br />I got my cd at Best Buy which has two bonus tracks.  For $9..couldn't beat that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave Flynn's SHARP OBJECTS a 5 star review and really enjoyed the book. However, if I had read GONE GIRL first I would have given SHARP 4 stars for not living up to the greatness of GONE.<br /><br />I loved this book from start to finish. Flynn is now is must read on my list.<br /><br />If you're a fan of thrillers or crime fiction of any kind, do yourself a favor and read GONE GIRL... today.
B0088WK27S|5.0|I was a bit scepticle about watching this movie but I must say it was well worth it. An inspiring story and actually based on a true story, this movie gives you hope that good still exists.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have only one word about this novel - Wow.  Best fiction I've read in a very long time.  A page turner on every level.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|You just can't go watch theses movies expecting a shakespeare type work of art. It was good for what it was and the story wasn't as bad as I expected and in the end the movie comes somewhat together. Besides, I liked the female lead.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|(Rewritten after multiple \\"not helpful\\" votes)<br />For the amount of money Disney dumped into this project, I expected a better movie.<br />It starts out well.  The pace is nice, the main character is likeable, and the dialogue has a good flow.  The problems start when John gets to Mars.  The special effects just are not as polished as they should be.  The scenes where Carter is first learning to walk on Mars are just awful and should have been cut.  Throughout the rest of the movie, the filmmakers struggled to properly integrate CGI with the live-action.  I honestly think it would have been a better film if they had just done the whole thing as animation.<br />Another problem for me was the movie smashes together 3 of the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the result is a lack of character development.  There are many great scenes and subplots that simply got left out and this led to relatively flat, cookie-cutter characters.<br />The streaming experience itself was very smooth.  There were no glitches or buffering problems during playback.  Picture and audio quality were both excellent.<br />Final verdict: This movie is a fun experience, but it suffers from a lack of character development and some poorly integrated special effects.  It is worth renting (once), but I would not buy it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I would have liked this movie. They missed so much of the story behind the action. The movie plot was weak and under developed.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found it to be very repetitive. Hard to pick out the story plot among all the extranious items. I did however finish the trilogy. Not sure what that says about me!?
B005D9MUWY|1.0|This may be an issue with amazon, not the product. Amazon said this as working on the kindle fire so I bought it and it will not work. At the time amazon said the tablet version wouldn't work. However, when I tried to install this version, it said get the tablet version. So I tried to get the free tablet version, and it never downloaded.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a wonderful series!! I can't wait for the 3rd.  You find out more about the characters, and get a deeper insight to life at the manor.  I love the charaters, the history, and how time changes for the good and the bad....love this and continue to tell all my friends to watch it.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I was surprised at how much i enjoy this remake. Usually remakes aren't as good as the original, but this one was done very well. Really enjoyed it. It followed a lot of the original script.
B005KWL2IW|4.0|Fun album, return to form! I still love Sound of White Noise and Among the Living better, but a great entry into Anthrax's album library.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I still don't know why I don't own this movie.<br />If you haven't seen this movie; stop what your doing and watch it.<br />Because this movie is worth your time.<br />I would recommend you buy it rather then rent it, even if you haven't seen it before.<br />It is a feat of strength to dislike this movie.<br />Highly recommend it for owning and renting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put it down!!!! Good book!!! I can't believe all the twists and turns!!! Didn't know what was coming next
B008JAG2AA|5.0|If you like the first couple American Pie movies, then you'll love this one.  It has the same humor and everything.  Also, it has almost all of the cast from the very first movie.  Definitely recommend this if you liked the first American Pie's.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|LOVE THIS NEW SERIES OF BATMAN MOVIES. MORE ACTION AND BETTER STORY LINE.THE OLDER VERSIONS WHERE COMICAL LIKE THE TV SERIES.MUCH BETTER ACTING.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this new album. Can't stop listening to One More Night and Doin Dirt. There are just so many great songs with wicked beats.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this in only three days. It explained a lot of issues from Fifty Shades of Gray. Im so Fifty Shades of HOOKED now!!!
B000NY12CI|5.0|If the reader is interested in learming about Islam as it is prectised in a tribal society, this is the book for you.  One can't help but admire the courage of this woman who was willing to sacrfice everything to free herself and others from the male domination of that religion. It's amazing to me to see how the forces of history converge at the proper time and place.Would this story had been told but for the welfare state of Holland? If there is to be any change in the Islamic beliefs, it will come from strong woman.  If there is a writer out there who would like to share their story about a reformed Islam, I, for one whould like to hear about it. .  I'm sorry it took so long for me to find the excellent read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app. No complaints. Only issue I have sometimes is that this app will randomly force close on it's own. Other than that, no complaints.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book!!!! Will read all three again.  Couldn't put it down! Loved the ending and the preview of \\" shades of Christian\\"
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was able to fill in all the gaps left out in the book prior to it. I really enjoyed how all the characters were tied in together this time.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|Starship Troopers: Invasion is a breath of fresh air from the previous from the three previous films. I've been a fan of Starship Troopers since I first saw the film Starship Troopers back when it came out in November of 1997 a few weeks before the very disappointing Alien Resurrection. It wasn't a great film, but it was fun and entertaining with Denise Richards and two of my favorite actors in Michael Ironside and Neil Patrick Harris. Michael Ironside I think is a little known actor, but you might recognize him from his voice acting as he was the voice of Darkside in the Superman and Justice League cartoon series along with his work as Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell series. Then there is the one and only Neil Patrick Harris who I've followed since I watched him in Doogie Howser. He really is special multi-talented actor who enjoys what he does. Heck was the best thing in the Harold and Kumar films, and the only reason to watch How I Met Your Mother. Though I enjoyed the movie I hadn't read Robert A. Heinlein novel the film was based off of. After the film I picked up the novel and loved it. Starship Troopers had little in common with Heinlein's novel besides a few things like the main character Rico. Seven years later Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation a film that should never have been made was released to DVD. The plot wasn't terrible, but the acting and effects were just god awful. After the crap fest that was Starship Troopers 2 Bold Films and Stage 6 thought it was a good idea to make Starship Troopers 3: Marauder. The film worked out well bring back Casper Van Dien and bringing in the hot Jolene Blalock along with a decent script, good acting, and above average effects, but even with that it was still just an average film, so I was surprised to hear there was another film coming out especially that I heard very little about it, but when I saw it at Red Box I decided to give it a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />As I said earlierin my review Starship Troopers: Invasion is a surprisingly really good film. The story follows the starship Alesia and their group of marines as they arrive at The Federation asteroid base Fort Casey, which has been overrun by bugs. It seems like a simple job for Lieutenant Tony Daugherty and his men, but things get complicated when Carl Jenkins the Minister of Paranormal Warfare commandeers the John A. Warden from his longtime Friend Carmen Ibanez and disappears. The Alesia her marines, Carmen and the prisoner Major Henry Varro chase after him on orders from General Johnny Rico. The story follows the universe of the films as it is a continuation. I won't give anymore way except to say the story is great, but better than the three previous films. The only real flaw with the film was the characters. That is a problem with films with a ton of characters like war films. For example The Thin Red Line it's a really good film, but is really hurt by the overabundance of characters. There are a lot of characters in Starship Troopers: Invasion to many for having real character growth. Many don't live long enough for you to care. Still there are some that stand out like Trig the women sniper of the team, and a private nicknamed Holyman. Obviously he is a religious man, and he was a good character. Of course the returning characters were good as well including Rico, Carmen and Carl. I wish studio that made the film had gotten Casper, Denise and especially Neil to do the voices of the characters. Still the voice actors did a good job voicing the characters, and it was interesting to see how the characters have grown and changed. The only character I didn't really like was Major Henry Varro nicknamed \\"Hero\\". The writers tried to make you care about him, but it didn't work he just felt like a useless character.<br /><br />Of course with this movie being a computer animated film I have to talk about the animation along with the action. Now I'm no expert in graphics or animation, so I only go by what I think is good, and in my opinion the computer animation was great. The film was really detailed, and you could see the expressions and emotion along with the pain and sadness in the characters faces. The detail of the ships and bases was really well done as well. Then there was the action, which there was of course a lot of, and it was brilliantly done with the bugs, explosions, fire fights and bloodshed. It is riveting and even if the characters aren't the best in the world the action will keep you glued to the film.<br /><br />Starship Troopers: Invasion overall is a great film, with great animation and action along with a really good story, good voice acting and decent characters. It is definitely the best Starship Troopers film I highly recommend everyone see especially if you're a fan of the films and book, but is it the best adaption of Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel no. That honor goes to Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles the excellent 1999 animated series that ran for 36 episodes. Sadly it got canceled before it could come to a conclusion. It uses the characters from the films, but takes a different route that works really well along with the animation which was great. The series goes in depth into the character's lives as well as brings some characters from the novel as well as introducing new ones. I highly recommend both this film and the animated series if you're a fan of the novel and films or you're a Sci-fi fan in general.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|It was sooooo sad! The beginning of the book is ok but the end of the book was my favorite part. His struggle to regain his humanity was really sad.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I think these books are better the the lord of the rings series, and I love that on HBO they are following the books almost to the tee.  Just glad I have gotten past the parts I've seen so now it is something new!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm a person that loves to read but usually doesn't find enough time in her schedule to pleasure read.....well not on this case. I couldn't stop reading.  I purchased the e-book do I read it in which electronic device that was in my possession: my kindle fire, my computer and my iPhone.  The internal struggle that both Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey were going through kept me coming back for more.  Plus Anastasia happens to be my name sake ;).
B005NFW0U0|3.0|The video quality is good but it would be nice to have the option to download to my desktop, so I don't have any broadband internet charges.
B0083VFEMW|4.0|As bouncy and poppy as one expects from Scissor Sisters, with more down beat/pensive songs thrown in. Still keeps the vibe the SS have in their previous albums!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I understand what Don Draper means when he says nostalgia is subtle but powerful. This book drew me in to the central story, which turns out wasn't preventing the assassination. No, the central story or stories as the case may be, are love stories. One, the romance between George/Jake and Sadie, and the other the love story that Stephen King tells about the past, which makes us long for a simpler time, whether or not we lived it the first time. In spite of the smells and the prejudice of late mid-century America, we fall in love just as surely as Jake did... deep in the heart of Texas.
B008602KQI|4.0|I like this movie a lot and believe that they captured the overall essence of the book.  The only thing that I was really disappointed with was that the DVD has no deleted scenes on it.  For those of us who have read the books, it would have been nice to see what hadn't made the cut.  Other than that very good dvd.
B002DD67XG|5.0|This is an excellent album by an extraordinary musician. Would definitely recommend this to anyone with a love for music.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|If you read Something Borrowed and liked it, then you will like Something Blue. It is the book form of a romantic comedy- light, happy ending and a quick read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great love story with a lot of spice.  Loved it! The story was a lot like shades of gray but better.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This is a great film. My kids love this movie and were inspired by it.  We were inspired to persevere and never giving up.

1409136612|5.0|Maeve Binchy is the greatest! The only problem I had with this book was that it ended way too soon!! I love the way many of the books by Ms Binchy are set in the same community in Ireland and you get familiar with a cast of characters and get to keep up with their story while you read the story of another family. I can't see why anyone would not completely enjoy this book. My personal preference is for books that don't include bad language and that makes me keep selecting books by Mave Binchy as well.
B008602KQI|4.0|As usual I like the book better. But again it is very hard to put this book on film. They did a good job and showed most of the mainpoints.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|This is a fun little logic/puzzle game that requires a bit of fast thinking and creative problem solving as well as good timing and manual dexterity.  It's a nice diversion game that can be picked up and put down quickly.  While there is a level editor that allows you to create new challenges, I've not experimented with that.  You can also download thousands of additional levels that others have created.
B00122BEPA|3.0|i KNOW THAT SAMMY HAGAR DIDN'T WANT TO DO A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE, SOMETHING HE FELT WAS A LAZY THING TO DO AND A QUICK WAY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK.<br />IN HIS TELL ALL AUTOBIOGRAPHY HE WENT INTO DETAIL HOW EDDIE TOOK FOREVER TO RECORD HIS PARTS FOR THE THREE SONGS THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE, NO SURPRISE OVER ED AND HIS BROTHERS DRINKING PROBLEMS SPILLING OVER INTO THE RECORDING PROCESS. NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THIS COLLECTION, JUST WISHED THEY MADE A WHOLE NEW ALBUM INSTEAD OF REHASHING PAST GLORIES.<br />  THE FACT THAT THERE WERE THREE NEW TRACKS RECORDED FOR THE COLLECTION WERE ACTUALLY VERY GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE BRILLIANT TONGUE IN CHEEK \\"UP FOR BREAKFAST.\\"  SOME OF THE LIVE RECORDINGS INCLUDED WEREN'T NECESSARY, THEY COULD'VE INCLUDED MORE OF HAGAR'S BETTER TRACKS.  THE DAVID LEE ROTH ERA MATERIAL WAS MORE ABUNDANT MAINLY BECAUSE THE SONGS WERE MORE SHORTER THAN THE MORE MATURE STUFF THE BOYS DID LATER IN THEIR CAREER.<br />  FOR A TWO DISC COLLECTION FOR NEW FANS I'D SAY GET IT. AS FOR THE DIE HARDS OUT THERE, JUST BUY IT FOR THE NEWER SONGS OR JUST DOWNLOAD THE MP3'S FROM AMAZON, I AM SURE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ALBUMS ALREADY ON CD OR VINYL.<br />  FROM ONE MUSIC LOVER TO THE NEXT, ENJOY FROM WHAT WAS AN AMAZING BAND, LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN GET IT TOGETHER WHILE THEY STILL HAVE DAVID LEE ROTH...CHEERS!
B008602KQI|5.0|Incredible acting along with very realistic storyline comparible to the actual book.  Yes, some of the gore was left out but in picture form, there was enough blood and guts portrayed.  The scene when Cat lets loose after the little one's death (from group 11-Rue?) along with Catniss having to kill somebody else, was emotionally catching.
B000KG499M|5.0|I bought this display base thinking it would fit my [[ASIN:B004KJ41E8 Bandai #03 Aile Strike Gundam 1/144, Real Grade]] but, alas, it doesn't. I do intend to build Master Grades in the future so I guess i bought this for future use.<br /><br />The plastic looks sturdy and constructing the base is fun (comes with a two screws so be ready). The base comes with a name plate and several connectors for various types of Gundam models.  The base does have some cool panel lining details which makes it fit the futuristic theme of Gundam. The packaging says it will fit: 1/144 and 1/100 scale models, High Grade, Master Grade, and Real Robot Revolution. But after testing with my 1/144 real grade I do not think it will work on the Real Grade series.<br /><br />Some researched has shown me that the Real Grades need the Action Base 2. Please feel free to comment if you found a way to safely fit a Real Grade to Action Base 1.<br /><br />All in all, a good buy.
B0051XQI84|4.0|We watched this movie as a family; I am a bit iffy about some of the mysticism with my young children, but overall it's a good time and a funny movie that everyone can appreciate.
B00821PH5M|5.0|We are all tired of the played out \\"Zombie Apocalypse\\" type televison shows.

It is far mor realistic than other outer planetary type shows because of one magic name....Steven Spielberg\\" whatever that man touches turns to gold.<br />This series is a must see.
B00846REIS|5.0|I totally love this book, can't wait for part 2!!  The story line resembles that of Fifty Shades, but more realistic.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great retention of suspense,and as good a stream of feminine consciousness as I can recall reading.Nicholson's answer( in his role as a writer) when asked how he visualized a woman was caustic and terse: I think of a man and subtract reason and accountability.<br /><br />That script writer never read Gillian Flynn.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I couldn't put this series down !!  There was a great character work up, felt like you knew these kids.  Plenty of action and wonderful tender moments !  LOVE LOVED it.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I was desapointed as I've asked for the original in French, However, as I've already read the book in Portuguese and English I can't avoid to say that Victor Hugo is really one of the Greatest Writter of the Universal Literature and les Misérables, his masterpiece, is one of the best books anyone interested in explore human  raw emotions can ever read.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book is fascinating and provides a unique look into the relationships and friendships of modern former presidents.  I just can't put it down!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The characters in this book are very interesting and the author has a wonderful way with words.  I've got to say that the first half of this book was a page turner but once the obvious switch happened....it was no longer as much fun to read.  This is the first time, in a long time, that I did not enjoy the ending.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I didn't have high expectations of this movie while watching the trailer.  That soon changed after the story started to unfold.  The characters were great and I think this movie was actually pretty funny for a drama.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|This is a wonderful story along the same line as Nicholas Spark tales. I greatly enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to anyone! Anyone, that is, that enjoys a \\"chick\\" flick!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King delivers a great horror story very much in the spirit of his earlier work. Mile 81 would have done well along side stories like Graveyeard Shift and Children of the Corn, pretty much anything in the Night Shift collection, or Skeleton Crew, or even Nightmares and Dreamscapes. For the Constant Reader, being most likely swept up in the brilliance and beauty of the Dark Tower series, and just about anything Mr. King has written recently, this horrific tale is a refreshing treat if you miss the earlier stuff that defined Stephen King as a modern master of the horror story. Quick, brutal, and not lacking substance, Mile 81 is a must-read for the casual fan and the Constant Reader alike.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Not the normal King.  The boundaries of reality are stretched but not broken.  Nice to go back 60 years and remember all the \\"good\\".
B004CFBMRY|4.0|A very interesting story that is enthusiastically told by a fellow running aficionado. Really enjoyed the character descriptions and their developments.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I've heard a lot of mixed things about the 4th installment.  Glad I ignored the negative.  So far, I'm liking it as much as the rest.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Did not hold my attention as Hunger Games did. The conclusion was seen way ahead. That said, I did enjoy the book and look forward for more triogys.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Read the books and they will fill in some of the questions the movie did not cover.  Overall a good movie.  Moved well and kept you interested.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Well written in many ways. Plot was disturbing but absorbing. Characters were well drawn. Ending was awful and overshadowed whatever qualities the book had.
B00122N0MU|5.0|If you are a young music fan or have lived under a rock for the last 35 years and just discovered Mark Knopfler than this is the album for you.  A solid selection of his top hits with Dire Straits and a reasonable smattering of his solo work.  The real beauty I find in Marks' work is not his ability to come up with the occasional hook, but his mastery of the guitar that makes it a distinct part of his presence.  His guitar work is so expressive and haunting that it can take over a song and lead you into remote corners of his creativity only to real you back in with his flawless timing and powerful story telling.  What is missing are songs like Six Blade Knife, You and Your Friends, Ride across the River, Fade to Black and Speedway at Nazareth which could make up part of a true listeners collection.  What is included are two powerful songs Brothers in Arms and One Every Street.  These songs are possibly the best engineered and most dynamic of the collection and deserve a close listen.  If you do not have a top of the line stereo, take a CD to you local stereo shop and have them que up these songs on their Krell, Mark Levinson, B&W 801 type of system.  Not only will the music reveal itself at a whole new level but your local shop will use these songs to demonstrate and sell their top shelf equipment from that day on.<br /><br />This album will also open you to Marks solo offerings which are quite good.  Some of the dynamics and epic boldness of Dire Straits are gone replaced by more subtle overtones and expressive slice of life style stories.  His mood can shift from blues to country to electric in the same album which always makes for an interesting listen.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I really love the CD the songs are great and I can't get over the sound. I play it everyday going to and from work.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Love all the Angry Birds!  This one is a big change from the other versions and it's taking me a while to get the hang of it!

B008602KQI|5.0|The movie depicts a time in the future where a cruel group that has defeated the populus of what you can imagine is the us and placed them under its thumb. simular to a communist state with a twist. The herowin manages to out smart the rulers. Good movie that is true to the book.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The storyline was good. But the characters were terrible. Crazy makeup lady really ruined this movie. An attempt to be dramatic that was more comical than anything.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob - I rate this book 5 stars. Ii is very compelling  and held my<br />interest all the way to the end.  I was almost sorry when I finished reading<br />the book - I wanted to read more.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One was very entertaining and well-written. Readers should be forewarned of the sexual content, however. Almost half-way through the second issue of the trilogy and can't wait to see how the author develops the characters even further.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|As the title suggests, the value of this book lies in its ability to bestow knowledge of current events on you, namely its potential for use as a political football.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have just begun to reread this wonderful classic by Victor Hugo.  I had read it as a teenager in High School many years ago.  It is taking me longer this time because I  am writing down the pearls of wisdom contained in this story, as I go along.  I had forgotten how fluid the composition of each sentence, of each chapter.  I have a very clear mental picture of \\"Monseigneur Bienvenue\\" in my mind.  I have had to put the book aside for a brief time, but I can't wait to get back to it.

B008602KQI|5.0|My whole family read the entire series, so we couldn't wait for the movie to come out.  And of course we had to buy it on DVD.

I think they've seen it 5 or 6 times now!

Robert Redford leads an all-star cast on an espionage thrillride that will leave you wanting more. The well-placed comedy adds flair to this classic 90s action/drama.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW! Fantastic read. Once I got two chapters in I couldn't put it down. The author really knows how to pull you in to the story. Found myself blushing a time or two!
B000SW16M6|5.0|I first saw this when it came out nearly 30 years ago and like it as much now as I did back then. For anyone who is into movies that offer a decent mix of comedy, drama and well-placed romance, this movie should be for you. I had to buy this to add to my collection of great 80s films: such as Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, St. Elmos Fire, Pretty in Pink, and many others.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|This movie flopped big at the box office but it's a great story, very well done, along the lines of Swiss Family Robinson and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  It's set on the 1800s and John Carter is taken to Mars through a \\"star gate\\" type of thing.  On Mars, he becomes a hero of the planet and falls in love with a beautiful princess.<br /><br />Like I said, it's really quite a good story....IF you can enjoy a fantasy.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book started off good couldnt put it down. When i started #2 i was a gonner lost sleep over it just to get another hour of sleep in. But book 3 is just not doing it for me lost my interest will only read it if nothing ele is available.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|The whole series is great.. Master and Commander is a reread about 5 times..  Very highly recommended... but dont blame me if you get hooked on the whole set
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|I use this product and love it, but at the same time I find it rather aggravating.  What bugs me about it is the graphic screen that does not go away.  It's fun the first time you see it, but it gets old rather quickly.  If they added a feature to turn that off and just let you work out of a window, the app would be perfect!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Everyone should be aware of this true story told in history and verified as to its truth.  Nothing like the holocaust must EVER happen again.  Be sure to watch, and thank God for our freedom in the USA!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Having a read a variety of 'self-help' books over the years - with limited success in producing lasting, measurable change - I purchased this book with some skepticism in spite of its glowing reviews.<br />However, it actually delivers in a way that works for me.<br />It provides a basic but solid understanding of the body/mind basis of motivation, and some simple and effective ways to apply that understanding. It does not require subscribing to a particular philosophy, belief, or system in order for it to work. There are no hidden fees.<br />Even though I first read the book relatively quickly, doing only a few key exercises, I have already seen tangible results in my day-to-day life.  If I never pick it up again, it still is easily one of the best investments I've made.<br />Which is why I'm re-reading it, more slowly, and applying the exercises as recommended.<br />My thanks to the author for presenting her findings in the form of this engaging and eminently useful book; I'm grateful to have found it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Whenever Nicholas Sparks comes out with a new book, I am so anxious to read it.  This author has never let me down; this book was absolutley excellent.  Sparks has a unique way of drawing me into his books; I can 'feel' the characters.  This book was difficult to put down.  I am always sorry when I finish one of Mr. Sparks' books and this was no exception.  I will read this again in a couple of months.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a very good rendition of the book.  It was surprising that it was so tastefully done because there was so much violence in the book.  There was very little blood and gore in the movie.  It is a good movie for teens.
B006LSZECO|4.0|really liked the first half and most of the second. Kinda felt let down at the end, I was expecting a little more.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Totally addictive and lots of fun! Wish you got more colors to start. Takes a long time to earn more.
0545101425|5.0|When it comes to the Hunger Games series, you never know what to expect.  This book, like the first two, will surprise and entertain you at every turn.  I listened to the book during my commute to work, and couldn't wait to get back in the car.
B008M36EEI|5.0|Absolutely  funny!  The movie captured all of the humor and poignancy of the book, but provide d a better ending.  Well worth watching!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is book three in the 50 shades series...and you know what they say...Third times the charm :) LOVED it! Couldn't put it down. I loved the progression in the relationship. The book is not all S&M Like people think and There is a Great Love story throughout the book. I know some are really hating this book series, finding it too dark or too \\"Dirty\\". I didn't find it either. Yes there are issues in the relationship that they need to work through, but what relationship doesn't have issues. Some people have a hard life and thus more \\"stuff\\" to work through.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie can't  wait till the next installment . My daughter just finished reading the series . I suggest that you read the books first before you vie the movie
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's alright...I don't know what all the hype is about...it's a love story...boy meets girl...boy chases girl...boy gets girl....just because he is into \\"unconventional\\" sex...what happens behind closed doors is between 2 people.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Lee Child continues the saga of Jack Reacher.  Ex-army M.P., now an American drifter, Reacher finds himself summoned in a way only he would understand by an old colleague who needs his help ASAP.  He soon finds himself in another adventure with three old Army friends, who set out to find out what happened to missing members of their old unit.  They set off to teach a sell-out to the country and a wannabe terrorist what it means when Reacher says, \\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"
B00493E1GI|5.0|First time I tried to watch it I fell asleep. But the next 6 times I fell in love with story, cast, scenery and whole concept of getting away to renew yourself.  Watch it and enjoy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|What a great series, I love historical fiction and this book did a great job of doing that with sci-fi.  Once I picked this up, I couldn't put it down.  I also finished the next book, A Shadow of Night, which was even better, I am sad the third book isn't out yet as I would love to finish this series.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the message, it did get a little bit technical for me.  I would recommend it as I like the message and inspiration.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I have to say that I did not like these books as much as I thought I would. I had read so many good reviews and expected a rich complex story. I thought the concept was great and even original (??). However the story was not well developed. I found the story to be too simple, predictable, cliché, and unreasonably heroic for my taste. Even the supposedly dark moments in the book were not described well enough to be felt dark or disturbing. This not to discourage anyone to read these books. Many people have read and truly enjoyed these stories. YOu may be one of them which is great.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Like her other novels, you are searching for the end once you read the first chapter. It was a good read.
B0030BCCAM|5.0|zombie/nick drake fans rejoice.  the first 3 excellent colin blunstone albums together in an inexpensive package.  blunstone's breathy vocals remind me of nick drake's  the music and songwriting is first rate throughout.  blunstone's albums are much more enjoyable than the zombies offshoot, argent.  buy this.
B004V4420U|5.0|It's really easy to read, the items not only are well explain but they are also seen in a good depth. There is a \\"Thins to remember\\" after each item and they help keeping things in your memory. =)
B008M36EEI|5.0|Its just all good. Different feel. I liked it.  AlOt. Do I really need to explain a 5 star rating???!!!!
034580404X|5.0|These books were dark, edgy and I couldn't put them down. What surprised me was that there are a couple of really fine authors that also write about this subject, and they should have the same praise. One or two have books that I liked more.The Shadowlands series by Cherise Sinclair is one of them.  All that aside these three books are a MUST READ.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Thought this was pretty good considering all the bad reviews. I have seen much worse with better reviews. This is why I don't rely on the reviews that much. Enjoyed this  movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was much better than I expected.  However, some of the sentences could have been better worded.  I found myself rereading sentences to make sure I had read them right within the meaning of the paragraph.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I love reading others' perspectives about our connection with the Universe and this one is a great read. I would recommend this to any and all believers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know a lot of people who highly recommended this book/series. I actually waited to get it until vacation so that I would have it to read while on the drive. I had the first one finished in about 10 hours, and that included non-reading time for naps, driving and dinner.
B004WWC9EC|5.0|Since I have read all but one of Dan Brown's books I guess you could say he is one of my favorite authors. As usual this was a book that was hard to put down. Having it on my Kindle made it so easy to read a few pages whenever there was a little time. If you like to feel like you are one of the characters and be kept at the end of your seat this is a book for you. It will grab your attention in the first few pages.....believe me.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Why I never read this book as a child, I can't recall, so it was a delight to find it here on Amazon. I have literally just finished it - and I loved it! Although most probably considered 'quaint' by today's standards, this book is a gentle gem of universal themes of friendship, hope, joy and redemption. I would highly recommend it to one and all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book. The ending left so much anticipation for the next!  Cant wait to read the next book!  I would recommend this book for any post-apocalyptic fan!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was one of the best NDE books I have ever read. Well written, easy read, and a book I highly recommend. I lost my son 3 years ago and this book took a weight off my shoulders as to where he is. I feel so much better knowing what I know now about dying. Thank you, Anita, for this special book!!!  A must read...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is great, I kept reading and reading, so enticing, love it, love it.<br />Truly enjoyable, did not want to put it down.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great app. I could spend hours playing this everyday. The levels are always constantly. adding a new twist.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading all three of these I finally watched the movie.  I got so into these books that I began to have dreams about all the chacters.  I loved all three of them, great story. I was a little leary about them at first because of all the viloince, but when reading them it turn out to be not that bad.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Great movie I would recommend and def see again. Lots of laughable moments and very good dry humor any brit would love ;)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It lets you see more behind Mr. Fifty Shades, and tells more about why he is the way he is.
B008602KQI|5.0|video service was great! did a pre- order and was able to watch movie on the release date got hard copy as scheduled!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is probably the best book out of the three of them. You get to know how the relationship between Mr. Gray and Ms. Steel is going to be, and he learns that its not all about him...
B007SGM084|5.0|It's a awesome book. Starting off sexual and turning into sexy romance. On the kinky side and pretty graphic. It will spice up your own sex life!
B008602KQI|5.0|great movie it could come true if rommney wins the election in november 2012 he could be in charge of the games.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|there is NOTHING romantic about this story. it is sad, sick, and  very disturbing. this book left me irritated and wondering what kind of sick %*># wrote this book. i have NO desire to read another one. EVER.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Typical Mark Wahlberg action movie. Lots of guns and shooting. Fun car chases and close calls. If you liked \\"Shooter\\" you will like this action adventure flick as well.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I found it to be very boring and repetitive. If she dug her fingers into his hair one more time I would have to scream!!
B001NLKWLW|2.0|Interesting story, I like how it moves through several generations to solve a mystery. The character development leads much to be desired, there are many trite, unbelievable characters in the book
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I never watched the Game of Thrones on TV so wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Each character is fully fleshed out, you almost feel you know them and you know their type.  I recommend this to everyone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I don't know what Fallen Tree Games is thinking, making a great game with NO permissions!? What, are they trying to confuse us or something?<br /><br />GREAT job Fallen Tree Games. Loved the first one and love this one as well. Keep up the good work.
B003E88TKS|4.0|When we saw the first trailer for this movie, we expected a light comedy with George Clooney as the main character. As it is the case with almost all of his movies, there are light and even comedic moments spread throughout the film, but it's not a comedy per se. The film starts on a light note, showing us how life on the road (or the plane)looks like for many of those people, traveling for weeks at a time. The main subject itself is anything but funny or light. People are losing their jobs right and left and this film shows, how it is mostly handled by the big corporations.The director was able to show the individual pain that comes with the loss of a job and how the person on the other side of the table can't really feel, what the now unemployed person experiences - until it might hit them too.<br />A very well executed film that makes you think, but doesn't put you down in any way. Recommended.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|As a reader who is already familiar with Jon Krakauers work, I was unaware of the Chris McCandless story until I was made aware of this book.  It is a fascinating story and obviously, McCandless was no ordinary traveler. Considering the feature film and subsequent documentaries about the McCandless odyssey, Jon Krakauer tells the story so well, delivering a true to life realism. As the weave of the story moves forward, it brought me to feel that perhaps the element of the story that I wanted to know more of was the formative childhood of McCandless, a window into what compelled this young man to direct his life toward such a tragic end. This is a book that I will surely read more than once.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I really like this album.  I like the more synth sound to Maroon 5 that they have on over exposed.  I also like the explicit versions because they really fit what they are singing about.  :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a good read as a murder/mystery book.  I rated 3 stars because at times I was frustrated with every other chapter being a flashback. The format lost me a bit but overall it was okay.
1455502758|5.0|You really should buy and read this book. It's worth every penny you would spend and the weight in which this book will hit you in the face will certainly change you forever.
B006LSZECO|3.0|For the most part I enjoyed this book. The author writes well and I liked the way she alternates chapters between the two main characters. I found the ending somewhat disappointing.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was hipped up before it was released on Blu-ray.<br />In my opinion it was a good movie.  The camera was a bit shakey on some scenes, but the it looks great when viewed on a full HD 120Hz LCD TV.  Can't wait to see the next 2 movies in Blu-ray.
B0006GAOCW|1.0|The poor little rich girl, how lonely! And it doesn't help that she gets to chauffeur her college friends at the taxpayers' expense on Airforce One (just for the bunch of friends), with Secret Service agents as butlers. Poor little girl!<br /><br />This is a paparazzi People-magazine type of schmaltz about a poor little rich girl's search for happiness.<br /><br />How vulgar and silly can you get?
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Liked the series in general - did not like the way the book was ended. Felt like it ended abruptly.
B007U8UBGI|4.0|Love it! Jack always has something newish, something borrowed or blue up his sleeve. Lottsa love gone wrong songs, love the piano! Very fun mix of songs, quirky lyrics....but dont we all know that about Jack. :)
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Liked it a lot - kept me wanting to read the last book of the series. I liked it better than both of the other books in the series.
0385535139|5.0|This book is both smilingly humorous and as serious as a heart attack. No matter how the author described the partners in the \\"boutique firm,\\" all I saw was Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathieu. The description of what my law brothers often refer to as \\"the dirty shirt practice\\" is more fact than fiction. While lawyers are perceived as wealthy and powerful, the majority struggle to build a practice and need to keep an eagle eye on cash flow. They dream of the big case just around the corner and have a tough-as-stone, one-person office staffer who knows more than their spouses about the lawyers. The description of the mass tort bar is equally accurate, as is evident by the barrage of TV ads soliciting clients to phone some 800 number if they have suffered a legion of injuries allegedly caused by some drug or medical device. John Grisham lays out these issues in a cogent and meaningful tale wrapped around two product liability cases, one involving a cholesterol medication tied to heart attacks, the other involving a lead paint coating on a child's toy tied to horrific brain damage. Despite these serious threads, Grisham's description of Oscar Finley and Wally Figg, and all the troubles that arise from involvement in a mass tort case, kept a smile on my face. I read this book nearly nonstop and was sorry to see it end. Thankfully, Grisham summarizes the lives of the characters after the story ends, which left me satisfied and pleased.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Great crazy weird movie that is a must watch. I just cant believe it took me this long to watch it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading \\"50 Shades of Gray\\", I HAD to read books 2 and 3.  I really wanted to know what happened to the characters.  I loved reading these books and felt a little sad when I was finished and they were \\"out of my life\\".
B0090EIILU|1.0|How this movie ever made it to theaters is beyond me. I have seen episodes of Sanford & Son that have kept my interest more. The humor sucks and the acting worse.
B004WOH19S|4.0|Excellent fast moving story about two publishing giants. It had many business references and had a classic good guy bad guy conflict.  It demonstrates how someone who is very successful can also be ethical and use his intelligence and background to help his business career.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|just started listening to the group. One of the best albums I've ever listened too. A definite must for anyone who appreciates some hard rock.
B003UBTX72|5.0|As a big Stones fan, it was fascinating to read about the life of Keith Richards, from his childhood through today, his influences, how he creates, his many loves, his many issues with Mick, his struggles with addiction.  I just couldn't put this book down.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|This was a great book about one person's experience losing someone very close to them and learning to come to grips with that through an amazingly physical and psychological journey.
0547391005|5.0|My son got this book for his little girl at the library.  He renewed it as many times as allowed and she cried when he explained she couldn't keep it any longer.  Grandma found it on Amazon and when I gave it to her she was so excited she clapped her hands and hugged it tight!  She Loves it! Who knew an old monkey from Africa could make a little girl so Happy?
B007IXWKUK|3.0|What  a  fantasy,  No male has  that  stamina.  Have  to  admit the  story line  got  better  with  each  book. Sequal in the  works?
B008EQIA7W|3.0|'Wrath of the Titans' is a solid pick for a Friday movie night at home.  It has good effects, plenty of action, and weak on plot/character development.  If you've seen its predecessor, 'Wrath' is better, although not by much.  The movie exceeded my low expectations, and was good mindless fun.  One thing to note: if you purchase the HD version with the intention of watching on the Xbox 360, Amazon Instant Watch doesn't support 5.1 on there, which is annoying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use, log in, view your profile and follow or unfollow fellow pinners. Have had no issues with this so far.
B00846REIS|3.0|Although this book is good, it's exactly like fifty shades of grey. It's uncanny how similar everything is. From the characters to the setting, down to the sexual acts. I will say its a bit more steamy than fifty shades.<br /> I will admit, I will read the next two books that come out because I enjoyed them. But be prepared if your a fifty shades fan.... This is a copy cat!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This is one of Jane Austin's lesser known works. Glad to find it on Amazon, but difficult to obtain a print version. Enjoyed it immensely. Better than some of her other books.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game is fun to play. There are times I don't want to put it down. I want to keep playing the game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Starts out interesting, but plot never really develops.  overall very poorly written.  Lack of plot.  I suspect being purchased for the shock value, but certainly no literary accomplishment.
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the movie, does not go into as much detail about the tributes but the movie was very well done.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|always a fantastic time. love the music. very relaxing and satisfying when you complete a table. wish there was more music tracks.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|This game is a strategic game of sort and the graphics are nice for a mobile game.  After so many levels it just becomes the same old game and then it become boring. This game won't get a bunch replay so enjoy the first run thru.
B008M34INW|3.0|Not the best Gibson has done but it had good story line and good action. Streaming quality was excellent and sound very good.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|We love this game.  It's sturdy, feels good to play with because it's all wood and it's easy to learn for little ones.<br />Great at teaching patience, turn taking, and gentle, dynamic touch.
B008476HBM|4.0|This is the first classic that I have ever read! I think that it was a great first choice to start reading these sort of novels.<br />Recommended! :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|Works great most of the time but I am getting a little irritated when it does not respond and I have to force close..fix this and it will be perfect
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Its alright but there are some problems. sometimes the app freezes up. otherwise it is a fun game. wish I could play it on facebook also.
B005IQZB14|4.0|In interesting read. I had never heard of the Pacific Crest Trail before, so it was eye-opener. I was in Yellowstone at the time so it was a very good book for the time.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Americans are generally uniformed about the rest of the world.  We may have something special here.  However we can learn from the rest of the world.  The BBC is our window window with a good view.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Finally he's happy!  I loved all the books but this one is the best!  Would love to read one about how the kids have effected their lives too.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Caitlin Moran firmly refutes the notion that feminism is an out-of-date thought model, and she does so with humor, bawdiness, and a very quick mind. She has a two-step process for modern young women to determine whether or not they are feminst: Do you have a vagina; do you want to be in charge of it? If you answered yes to both, you are a feminist<br /><br />Her analysis is set against the decidedly unprivileged background of her own youth as the eldest of seven siblings in publicly subsidized housing. This book is a witty romp about some serious stuff and I recommend it to your attention.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very different book - twists and turns all the way through make for a very fast and good read.  The depth of the characters was amazing and extremely dark a well written account of the secret side of what seems like average every day people.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it...ending could have been different, but still quite enjoyed the book! Book 1 was my favorite, but very much enjoyed this journey with Katniss beginning to end of this trilogy!! Can't wait to see more from Suzanne Collins!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|The music is really great, and most of the songs have a very good balance between melodie and drums. If you like indie rock you will love this album.
B000ICXQGK|3.0|I never got to watch this.  I was saving it for Labor Day Weekend but when I went to watch it, it had been removed from my \\"library\\"  I think it is supposed to be good but I don't know.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Me and my kids love this movie. It has a good story and is very funny. We've watched it so many times and we still laugh each time we watch it.
B00846REIS|4.0|it was a really good book, the only problem that i found was that it followed the same story line as 50 shades. i felt like i was reading the same book again and it was very predictable.
B0037RDPEG|2.0|I couldn't connect with this book. The author rambled on about the first part of the book for too many chapters. The second and third part was readable. Don't know why everyone raved over it.I would'nt recommend it.
0375507256|5.0|Everything is connected. I was completely enchanted with this book. I laughed out loud, I cried, I enjoyed every word. Each chapter reads like its own short story, until you start to realize...everything is connected. When I finished the book, I wanted to go right back to the beginning and read it again.
B007MJT1K2|1.0|Violence, story they can't follow. Waste of money. Will not be buying this movie now, or in the future ever.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in quite awhile. I enjoyed it even more because I read the book first. I can't wait for the next two installments to be made.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|As any of you could guess this was an amazing movie, didn't feel like it dragged on at all. And there was much more graphic violence than I would have guessed.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|The program does not include headers & footers nor page numbers. It will not open if the original contains these items.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is outstanding.  After reading Fifty Shades of Grey I thought it couldn't get any better but it actually did.  I can't wait to read the third installment Fifty Shades Freed.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Curious that the pivotal figure is the one most in the dark.  We also see her as increasingly absorbed about being the cause of her own effect.  Still, a good extention of the original story.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|I wanted to watch this movie again, before going to the cinema to watch the new batman movie. I usually rent through itunes, but i saw that amazon is providing the same service. I have bought through amazon in the past and I haven't had a negative experience that's why i decided to give it a try (the price was also cheaper than itunes). I tried watching the movie but I wasn't successful, the audio would go faster than the video.I couldn't finish the movie. I tried downloading the movie to my computer but i wasn't able to....I have an excellent internet connection, i have no problem downloading video or watching TV or movies online (through other companies) so I was very dissatisfied with the quality of this service provided by amazon.I will stick to my regular use of the amazon website.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Spatacus (portrayed by Kirk Douglas) made a far better transition from gladiator to a rebel warrior with a cause.  At least the book series finished with a reasonable degree of conclusion.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|Got the tool and was happy to replace my old multi-tool I've had for years. This one looks great. A few knives screw drivers the whole nine yards. Thought the phillips screwdriver was some joke since it was so flat that I was wondering where the real one was. It works but barely.<br />So put the knife in its sheath and went on my way. About an hour later I bent down to pick up something the straps on the sheath broke. It was disappointing, but it had a second strap config on the  it so hooked it up that way. Well it lasted about another hour and that broke too. The knife tool is great but the carrying case is poor quality. Needs thicker straps to carry that big tool.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read.  Takes place in a suburb outside of Boston.  An assistant district attorney's son is accused of murdering a classmate.  Lots of twists and turns.  Very thought provoking.  Did not want to put this book down.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome books! Loved all 3 of them, couldn't stop reading! Hope there is more to come in the near future.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I'm not much for games,never was but this is great .Crazy birds dive you bonkers trying to keep up.I can't keep my Fire from my wife long enough to play.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Item arrived in a timely manner. I didn't need as long a cable but it did the job it was purchased for. Copying home movie tapes from camcorder to computer.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Thank you Adam Brown and everyone that contributed to his life and his story.  Going from his young days and trials to his determination and grit inspired me and I know it will inspire others.
B007SGM084|1.0|The books are sooooooo very bad. After the first torrid sex scene the rest is just a copy paste of the same with slight variations (change of location) and is repeated ninety seven times. I really do not get the populality of thesee. They are fifty shades of BORING.
B004Q3UJ5I|5.0|Awesome... One of my favourite seasons... This has a lot of plot twists and great casting. The videography is also very well done. Really builds on the first 3 seasons.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read all three books; the first movie was very close to the first book. Can't wait for the other movies! Excited!
0307951529|5.0|CG came to LA on his book tour and gave an incredible speech that really inspired me to read his book and learn how to enhance my small business. He is very down to Earth and it was so nice to see a motivational speaker that wasn't shoving the information down your throat with over the top speeches. I learned a lot from him and cannot wait to read his book! Check out his tour dates and see if he is coming to a city near you!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Mmmmm interesting reading!  I found it captivating really!  Loved it found i couldnt put the book down.  Buy it you will love it, its  a<br />romantic story really.  Every girl will find it intriging to read!
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is the 1984 of the current generation.  There is no way the movie can capture the essence of the book, but the movie is a nice accompaniment to the book. Read the book....watch the movie.  You'll be glad you did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|obviously the app lacks some of the ease and functionality of the full site version, but is still nice to use and great yo kill time...like pinterest is known for! :)
B008602KQI|2.0|This is a film with high production value.  However, the plot is simple and the outcome is easily predicted after the first 10 minutes. The storyline follows a Myth format. It's just a matter of enjoying each battle between our heroine and her foes to its predictable conclusion. You may not need (or want) to see it a second time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I started reading this the instant it hit my Kindle - in the middle of the night.  Far from telling America's secrets this is a gripping first person account of what drives a Seal, the kind of deployments they face, and the successes of our Seals.  The writing is great.  Thank you from the bottom of my American heart for being on the wall for all of us.  And thank you for sharing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is one of the most thrilling and thought provoking book I've read in a long time.<br />As soon as I finished it I downloaded the third book \\"Mockingjay\\".  I highly recommend<br />all three books of the Hunger Games.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i love love love this book the series are awesome they're my FAVORITE books i strongly recommend you to read it lol Best book ever! its so interesting entertaining with a little bit of a love connection but ntt anything like twilight. you never know watt happens next everything come with a shock or surprise read the first book first. i couldn't stop read i finished in 4 days and that's really good for my grade level. i think its better than the movie! but it!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I have not read the books and did not know much about the series before I saw this movie. That being said, I did not read the books of the Lord of the Rings series or the Harry Potter series and had no problem connecting this those stories in movie form.  There was so much hype about this movie that my husband and I thought we had to see it.  Maybe something was lost by not seeing it in the theater but I just wasn't that into it.  I get that we are supposed to be horrified at the idea of sacrificing children for the sins of our forefathers.  I get that it would be a horrible experience that would turn a child into an animal and rip your humanity away and that two people refuse to become animals.  I get that there will always be people who stand to profit from the suffering of others.  I just didn't care, I didn't feel like there was enough to make a connection with the main characters.  And all the surrounding figures are distracting even if colorful.  Visually this picture is very good and they play up this point.  I will however see the next movie in the series and hopefully I will connect more with that one.  It was on sale and so I would say it was worth the price for rental.  I will not be buying this movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love the different takes authors have on time travel, how it works and the effects resulting from changes.  I love (good) SK books.  What could be better than a good SK book about time travel?  This is one of the best books I've read this year.  I enjoyed our visit back to creepy old Derry, ME.  If you're reading reviews to sway you for or against investing in this book, I think it was definitely worth the money.
B0088TG252|4.0|This movie keeps your on the edge of your seat most of the movie.  I was never bored and didn't notice the time fly by as I watched.  The intensity of both actors is very good and you end up rooting for the good (Ryan) and the bad (Denzel) guy.  Ryan Reynolds plays a safe-house manager who receives an extraction team holding Denzel Washington in custody.  Denzel plays a secret agent who went rouge years ago.  He is using the safe-house to try to get away from some thugs who are trying to kill him but of course they find him and then the run is on.  Ryan tries to keep Denzel in custody as the two fight off waves of thugs, all the while the government is trying to determine is Ryan has gone rouge too.  It's a good movie and I will probably see it again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this after the 50 Shades trilogy and didn't realize how bad those were until I started ready this!  I mean... 50 is fun but Gone Girls is a seriously good read.  I love the characters and the twists and turns.  I also really enjoyed the in depth looks into human behavior.<br /><br />Very much recommending this one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games so little time! games are fast paced and fun to play. a great selection and free to play
B008MEM24S|5.0|Got it for my duaghter age 11 and even my son can play it a bit age alomost 4. They play it on vehicle trips camping and to family get togethers. They like ist alot as it is simmiler to Whare's my water that she had played a bit before that it was easy to get into and now she and her freinds play it on her Kindle Fire.
0545265355|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is action packed and full of great surprises.  I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of 13.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Awesome!  Love creating different sounds and adjusting volume on each sound to create the perfect relaxation music. Just wish it had a timer feature.
B008602KQI|3.0|I thought the book was way better than the movie. The movie could have been way more exciting if it was rated R instead of PG-13. I think they should come out with a rated R version and let the younger teenagers watch the pg-13. but overall the movie was okay and i really enjoy having it on amazon instant video!
B00821P888|5.0|This is a great show! I have watched every episode and am an instant fan! Cannot wait for next season to begin!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was excellent!!  Full of excitement. Could not wait to get to the end.  The entire trilogy in my opinion made it a book you wanted to continue to read.  Hard to put down.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was better written then the first in the series. We learn a lot more about fifty. There is still a lot of sex in this book but the main focus isn't on it, like in the first book.
B000WD7DOG|4.0|Love Barney, Ted and Marshall! Not a big fan of the two girls in this show!! Its a good episode, not the greatest by any means!
B00338QELU|5.0|Since Mankell is Swedish, I expected a Swedish setting.  And it was, briefly.  Then the reader is removed to ancient Japanese history, and then to African politics and new threads begin to emerge.  A Swedish female judge is the link between all these confusing sections, and little by little she follows the clues to a brutal mass murder in a remote Swedish town.  Everywhere there is a cloud of fear and mystery--no one is safe, it seems.  Everyday lives on several continents are always in danger.<br /><br />This novel was deeply engrossing.  The complications were far deeper than the usual mystery.  The judge's quest for the truth was dangerous and powerful and I kept hoping her life would be spared.  It's a super good read.
B006ZTY07Y|5.0|Loved this episode!! If you have seen other episodes of Big Bang theory, this one won't disappoint. If you have not, you will still love this!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If you're expecting a light, easy read and some good sex scenes, then you'll like this book. The writing gets redundant though!
B00808CNPO|5.0|Loved this episode!! If you have seen other episodes of Big Bang theory, this one won't disappoint. If you have not, you will still love this!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|this is a good game, the only down fall is that it randomly got messed up and now you cant view your coins. still a fun game even with the glitch active.
B001BR90O8|5.0|an older movie with michael j fox. a guy trying to move up in the company of his uncle sure leads to an interesting ride with some serious antics n curveballs in it. overall a good one to watch.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am enjoying this book very much.  I have always wanted to read it, and with the new movie coming out in December I became motivated.  It is much better than I thought it would be.  DJ
0525953728|5.0|First, I pre-ordered this book and it was released on Sept 4, and with prime, I expected to receive it by Sept 6.  Instead, much to my delight, I received it Sept 5.<br />As this is Sept 6 today, have not had chance to complete the reading yet.  But already I can tell that this is a book to keep forever and to encourage younger folks to read and learn from.<br />Sept 7 ---- Just want to add these comments, since reading other negative comments regarding the military; one, that I am not military, never have been, and never will be --- as I am a seventy year old retired woman.<br />Second, this book is a must read because of the total lack of transparency in our government these days.  The book would not have been necessary if the truth had been forthcoming by the government.
B008602KQI|4.0|Greta film. I did not read the books and went into this movie blind. I enjoyed the cinematography and overall plot line. I feel that Jennifer Laurence is the next big thing in Hollywood and her character is a great role model for young women everywhere.<br /><br />4/5 stars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Revived an old womans sex life for a while. Loved all three. Will read again. Have told several friends to read.
B007SNMYNS|1.0|Not for the people who just wants to drop some weight.Way too restricting and the book is bogged down with way too many medical reasons why we should not eat wheat .
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy and fun way to show your individual style, tastes and hobbies.  Easy to link with Facebook and have your friends join in the fun.<br />I have found so many great and useful ideas and recipes on Pinterest.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This soundtrack, from a terrific movie, is one of the best ever !!!  My wife & I listen to it all the time !!!
B008JAGG38|3.0|This movie doesn't do much beyond our expectations of these characters, but, in the end it delivers enough laughs to satisfy one in the decision to hit [play].
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Simple as that. Anyone that watched the original series and has seen most the previous movies will appreciate all the call-backs from this installation of trek. The back story for Kirk is just meh. And Kirk running into Spock Prime is just ridiculous. All in all a good action sci-fi moving picture.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the all three books and was sad when I read the last book!  Took my time reading a little every day to extend it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I enjoy this game. I have it on multiple devices. The objectives keep me playing. It is challenging and fun. I have spent hours playing.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Definitely the best of the trilogy. I'm glad I took the time and I think Alex was glad she spent the time.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books so wanted the movie so I could watch whenever I wanted.  It came in great time and the big surprise I got it free to download on my computer so I can watch it anywhere I am.  Love it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was superb, but it is different from the book.  In the book everything is according to Katniss's view but in the movie you see what other characters our doing behind the scenes<br /><br />Amy L. Wygal
B003O86FMW|5.0|I heard so much about the Hunger Games, just had to read it.  Although I think the series is a wonderful read, it is not for the younger crowd.  I definitely recommend the series for the 16 and over, but anything younger seems inappropriate to me.  It was well written, definitely kept my interest from page to page, I think I read the trilogy in the space of 2 weeks.  I really enjoyed the writing, the author is great!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this entires series was awesome.  I borrowed the first two books of the set from a friend and realized I could download them on my Kindle Fire.  So, I ordered the third - easy transition and so convenient.  I loved all three and looking forward to a continuation. :)
B004Z5POAW|3.0|Nice book. A good analysis of many important personal development items. But it lacks the goosebump passages i experienced many times in the alchemist.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|WOW ... what a love story! These books are written in such a way, that I have no problem envisioning all the characters in my mind; they have come alive in such a dramatic way that makes me blush!
B008602KQI|5.0|Reading the book first really helps to understand the movie.  The Hunger Games was set in a surreal world, with strong characters.  I found the movie captured the books feel, as best a movie can do and I found the characters to be mostly right on with what was in my minds eye as I read.  Some of the actors surprised me on how they took on their character, great job by ALL.  Read the The Hunger games trilogy first before seeing this movie to get the total effect.
B005YZX32I|5.0|The title says it all. Best feature is being able to use the search function in the kindle app, making it easy to find different key terms and diagnoses.
B003O86FMW|4.0|From the ending of the first book, Hunger Games, you knew that there was something bad coming up. There were also a<br />lot un-answered questions that made you want to read further. Getting \\"into\\" the book made it quite hard to put it<br />down without getting to the conclusion. [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an inspiration to anyone who reads it. It is a brilliant piece of work based off of the very true life of Henrietta Lacks and her kin. It's tragic and funny in all of the right places. Though it is an educational novel, it certainly keeps you hooked for the emotional ride that is the Lacks' lives.<br /><br />I hope to read more stories like it in the future.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|After all the stellar reviews, I have to admit the novel was a let down. Apparently, it features many characters and plot lines from his previous short stories -- and I can see how this could have been a  great 'short story.' As a novel, it just goes on and on. The future is too similar to our present (with a thin layer of fantastic creatures laid over it) to make it interesting. If the message was \\"the more things change, the more things stay the same\\" and humanity is simply doomed to repeat its own mistakes, then, yes, I got it -- after about ten pages.
B005MW95JI|5.0|Amazon is my favorite place for streaming shows I need to catch up on or a friend just told me about. Easisest menu. I do wish it was clearer which episodes I've watched yet. I get confused when I'm starting and stopping an entire season. Perhaps better/deeper shading when I'm finished with a number episode so I know where i've left off
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Almost too hot! Well written and alot of sex.<br />However, the story has substance and is quite interesting reading. Make sure your partner isn't far away during the reading of this book!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was good although I read the 3 book series first and I was disapointed that they left so much from the book out. I am looking forward to the next movie in this Hunger Games series.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I got Imagine Dragons EP \\"Continued Silence\\" a couple months ago and love it! I was really happy to find out that they have the same sound as their EP in their full length album. I really love this CD all the way through! This is the kind of album that will be in my top favorites for a long time. They have an awesome unique style, all the instruments and vocals go together so perfectly in every track. These guys know how to write music, and I can see in the future  that every song they write will be grand! I believe these guys are going to hit the top fast! I highly recommend this album to anyone!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I recently found out that I'm intolerant of Wheat. The procedure cost me about $400, so i'm delighted to be able to tell people read this book and for under $15 you will have a better understanding of wheat intolance than what I learned spending $400!!
B008602KQI|3.0|I purchased the blu-ray and watched the movie after I read the book.  The book is not real complex and you would think that it would be a simple thing to make the film and not change things.  This movie, like many, not only leaves out alot of things, it changes plot lines for no apparent reason.  For those who have not read the book the movie will be very entertaining. If you have read the book be advised that the movie leaves out most of the sub-plots and changes others. Unfortunately, this has become all to common with movies based on novels. The movie is entertaining so it gets 3 stars, if it had followed the story better I would have given it more stars.
B006X9EUUS|5.0|I have a long commute (90 minutes) and this has become the turn it up loud and let the miles and minutes pass by. I get home after a long day renewed, refreshed, with a smile on my face and a sense of triumph and victory in knowing I have shared this time with a truly creative artist who loves God as much as I do. If you're \\"religious\\" you may not like this, but if you're a sinner saved by grace and have waded through life's sh*t then you'll love this. I can almost guarantee it. (At least you'll respect it.)
B0011Z10PC|5.0|Great album! One of the best albums I have ever heard. I highly recommend to everyone who loves great rock and roll!
B007SGM084|5.0|The book is good almost can be a comedy with the wording and stuff and reading it with a girlfriend reading it to makes things in bedroom ten times more interesting
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I put it on before I got to sleep and in no time I'm out like a light.
B007SGM084|5.0|My friend left her hardcopy book at my house and I picked it up to read the first few pages to see what the fuss was all about.  I got addicted right away.  I had left the book in my desk at work and had to buy the trilogy on my Kindle.  I love it!! I wish it didn't end!  The sex parts got redundant after a while and I started to skip through them.
B00132S74A|3.0|Am big fan of Ken Follett's books. Amazes me that he can right in so many different historical periods and about so many types of subjects and people. However, \\"Code to Zero\\" is not up to his usual writings. Although a good ending, much of the book is a slow read and the plot does not flow as his other plots do. Clever use of Rocket launch paragraphs at beginning of each chapter and then back to the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This was a really fun app! A \\"hint\\" button could be included for people who are stuck, but I got \\"perfect\\" on all levels (except the ones designed for a tablet). I never had any issues with it. I have a Droid X Android OS 2.3.4 (Gingerbread).
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is enjoyable.  I read all the books and was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  I found it very entertaining and there was enough of subtle hints and clues dropped here and there for future movies to make them even more interesting.  Definitely recommend.  But the books are still better; nevertheless, I have never seen a movie that was better than the book.  Enjoyable!  :)
B00355L2TU|2.0|When I read the reviews I saw that many people complained of knee pain, I blew it off and assumed they were \\"old people\\".  I got through 17 straight days before I had to stop.  The moves not only affected my knees, but my ankles hurt so bad that I was hobbling.  I'm 23 and in good shape.  I don't think it was the exercises themselves, but the pace.  The video is so fast that you don't have time to focus on the movements and make sure that you're keeping good form.  I would suggest a work out based on a number of reps, rather than a set time.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Great movie! Just wich I could stream in in HD via my logitech revue. That is the reason i gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey's Bossypants is like a conversation with a good friend over a few drinks. I actually read it after \\"hearing\\" my niece reading it - she kept laughing out loud when we were sitting at the beach so I downloaded it on my Kindle and was not disappointed. The most entertaining read in a long time, Fey approaches the subject of gender politics in entertainment in a straightforward way and gives credit to mentors (and Alec Baldwin) who saw her immense talent, encouraged her and created opportunities for her to showcase her gift for great writing and putting together an amazing ensemble of talent on 30 Rock. I may now have to watch the show although I will always be a Tina Fey fan.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This is a very good book! It's even better than the TV show which is one of the best on at this time.
B007SGM084|3.0|No muy buena la historia, poco enriquecedora. Abusa mucho de escenas de sexo y explora poco el lado psicológico y lo aborda de manera muy superficial.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved this book, although it was slow to begin and toward the end it rambled a bit.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|The book is definitely more thorough in explaining the whole story (as most books are), and as always happens in movies, changes and cuts had to be made, but in all, the movie is great.  If they would have put everything in the book into the movie, it would have had to probably been rated R, and that would have cut the audience down, so they had to do what was necessary to still get the point across, but appeal to a broader audience.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|If you are a Software Developer, and view it as a profession rather than just a job, then this is required reading.<br /><br />It's also a book that you should reread every few years.
B004PGO25O|1.0|Was hoping to learn something new with this book, but unfortunately it is simply a rehashing of ideas (sometimes directly quoted!) from his previous work, The War of Art.  The book is far too simple, far too short.  It's unfortunate because The War of Art had a huge impact on me, but this book did nothing, and just seemed like a lazy effort.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not wait to start reading book two and hated to know only one book left in the series.  Great writing for a first time author and wow what a story! Mainly a love story that has interesting characters and family ties.
B006GM8NXM|5.0|This episode will lead you wanting more. This is a great show. I have finished watching 2 seasons in like a week. I can't stop watching, a must see.
B004NELBPC|1.0|This is not a news organization.  It's a propoganda mouthpiece for the White House socialists.  Go see \\"2016\\" to learn Obama's plan to re-make the United States into a Eurpoean-style welfare state, to enable the Muslim world and see where he developed his radical philosophy.  Why doesn't the media reveal his mentors? Why don't they tell the truth about how wealthy Obama is?  Did you know he pulls in some $70,000 each month from book royalties on top of his Federal salary?  Don't be fooled by the Huffington Post, the Washington Post, NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was one of the best book..ever.  Every page was interesting.  The development of the characters was visual.  The ending was total shock.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I now can actually repin things! Def the best app ever! When i saw it i wasnt sure if id be a good one but it was!!!
030758836X|1.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and did not finish it.. it did NOT grab me at all!  I am an avid historical fiction reader and wanted to try a mystery for a change.. think I will stick with Sandra Brown when I take a break from historic fiction.. The plot of this book started out great, but fell apart during the first 50 pages... happy I did not waist my time to finish it.. found out the rest of the story from my friend..
B00563M11M|5.0|Snuff is excellent,well worth reading,if you only ever read 1 Terrry Pratchett book read Snuff,full of some old and well loved characters and interesting new ones
B003A9OVS0|5.0|My son brought this to my attention after getting a 1 song free download from The Gorillaz website. I liked it, so we decided to get the whole album.  We love it! Great for young and old alike.  I highly recommend \\"Sweepstakes\\".
B006LSZECO|3.0|Thank heavens the story as told by the unbelievably inept husband -(really, a writer out of work who does nothing but play video games, who promises his wife he'll take her back to NYC, then buys into a bar???? give me a break) - that part ends before I abandoned the read. Then the sociopathic wife takes over, and it's pretty fascinating from that point, but still a few too many weirdos. Criminals one thing, the mentally deranged quite another.  But then, I'm a psychiatrist's child, so I may be biased.
B008M34INW|4.0|A lot of thrilling action that keeps you hooked till the end. The plot is somewhat loose towards the end but the movie is highly enjoyable overall.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  Very moving.  A must read for all teens and adults.  Couldn't wait to read the other two novels.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always liked playing solitaire; this is pretty much like on the computer, but with an optional auto finish. I do enjoy tapping the card instead of dragging it. I would like to see more deck appearance options though.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What a great book for a summer vacation by the pool and beach. The constant twists and turn are classic and the answers are as good as the journey which is rare.
B008602KQI|4.0|Followed the book pretty well. Moved along quickly. I was disappointed in the parade and preparations for it. Although her costume was great the excitement was dulled.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I loved the first Quell and I'm sure I'll love this version too.  Thank you Fallen Tree Games and thank you Amazon.  HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was ok.  Guess I expected more with the hype about this book.  Kind of left me depressed about how people manipulate each other in a marriage!!!
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Great story  easy to follow and better follow through than true blood<br />good books alone, great story in order written<br />can not wait for next book
B007IXWL2C|3.0|If all you want to do is read about sex then you will love the trilogy. The plot was only hinted at by the end of the first book, and started to get a little better by the end of the second book. The third book finally made it worth the time to read it.  Would have really have enjoyed it if it had been much less detailed in the sex and just been in one book.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The book was very creative and really drew me in. It was definitely a book that I was disappointed when it was over.  Not your typical vampire book.  Created great visualization. I would definitely recommend it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the Pinterest app.  It is very easy to use, and I love how easy it is to repin!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing this Mahjong.  It was some difficult and easy ones to play.  Also, some are a challenge and some not.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is the fourth time I've read this book. It gets better each time I read it. It's a must read for every age. Now that I have it on my Kindle, I'll probably end up reading it again. It's addictive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great follow up to the first book in this trilogy! Easy read, easy to follow story line, and keeps you wondering what will happen next!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is essential for anyone who has developed a \\"Wheat Belly\\" as described in the book.  The truth about how the wheat we eat has caused the rampant obesity problem in the United States. This is a life style changing book and I would recommend it for anyone who has been fighting the weight battle most of their lives.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|Simply fantastic.  The album is amazing from start to finish.  The deluxe edition is the way to go as it includes the extra songs and I love the rendition of \\"Addicted to Love.\\"  Couldn't recommend this album higher.
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw it in the theater twice, and I'm equally glad to have ordered it for my home library collection.  I only add movies to my home collection if I feel that I would watch them more than a couple of times (otherwise I just use my Netflix account to order them when I want too).  But, this movie is so well done, so moving and having this with all the extras makes it a great addition to my library.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|A must see for all movie enthusiasts. Probably more to a man's liking however. The content is very much believable though improbable. I would consider it be be in my top 25 best films of all time. Much more here than a POW escape story. The dialog is spot on rendering the British feel and their attitudes. First rate portrayals in almost every scene.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was recommended to me after i read the Fifty Shades trilogy and was pleasantly surprised. It has its similarities but is completely different when u get to the heart of the story. I feel its a bit more complex and \\"adult\\" meaning Eva isn't naive as Ana is and Gideon knows what he wants a little more than Christian does.<br />My only problem is that this first book was too short (read it in just a few hours) and I still have a month to wait for the second to come out. I LOVED Fifty Shades and feel that anyone else who did would enjoy this book as well.
B0083Z6AH6|1.0|As an Austen fan I was disappointed. To a non Austen fan this book is akin to watching paint dry while listening to a 4 hour lecture on the intricacies of interpretive dance, followed by a cyborg reading the phone book.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|We read this book as part of our Judgment and Decision making course in the University of Queensland.  Good read.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was great for the entire family. There are parts in this movie for every movie lover. My husband enjoyed the action, my son loved the trivia of the game, and I extremely enjoyed the drama. It gave us a family night to remember.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|This movie gives you what most comedy films do now a days and that is a few laughs and some cliches nothing out the ordinary. It has the story line of almost Every movie dealing with friendships gone wrong and how they mend it. Great movie to watch with friends or a girlfriend.
B009329ZF2|4.0|My family couldn't take their eyes off the screen!!!! We really enjoyed this movie and will soon be purchasing it. The main character actually reminds me of my husband. Even if they start out under achievers they always seem to be a Hero in the end!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat while reading it, and made me day dream about the magical tents when I wasn't reading. Great book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the fact that this calculator is so large.  It works beautifully.  And the best thing ever its free.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|I returned this item because it was damaged.  I can not rate an item that was returned to you with out me being able to see it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it because there are clients for all platforms, my iphone, ipad,kindle fire, Mac, windows  and nexus 7! allows me to capture anywhere and review anywhere!
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I have played this title 2 times and it seems they force me to watch these previews.<br />This totally destroys any possible postives about this disc. It's a shame.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
0525953728|5.0|I was very excited to get this book. I downloaded it on my Kindle and was immediately hooked. with in-depth accounts of SEAL Team Six, I was pretty impressed with what goes on in covert operations. Even in the Bin Laden raid,  I was very impressed how many things that went wrong, but they still got the job done. All of our military men and women, should be celebrated every time we see them. the book goes into complete details of the raid. as a military historian myself and i have lots of military members of my family, I do not feel that this book is a breach of classified details of any missions form future missions that united states government will be doing.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|I loved the individual description of the family members of this book. The story line was good, and at times didn't want to put down.  Near the end of the book, the story line started to become predictable.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I loved Castle from the beginning for its fabulous writing. Now with season three the writing is still funny and the characters are more heartfelt than ever. Season 3 is one of the best!
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor's greatest hits is one of the best albums ever. If you never have listened to it before I highly recommend it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the service in providing me with this video.  Watched it twice now and loved the movie.  Tastefully done. It did not just go for the gore.
B005K17RU0|5.0|DO YOU NEED TO CHECK THE WEATHER ?THAN GET THIS MUST HAVE APP FOR ANDROID USERS ,YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Not my type of book at all but I loved it. I thought it was clever and kept me hanging on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow this book is sooo cool I like never put it  down and I am reading Catching Fire AGAIN!!!!! I can't help it. Suzanne Collins really did it up! Soooooooooooo AWESOME! I hate that I had to borrow it for free from prime. :( Suzanne Collins you are so awesome!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a great read.... Somewhat similar to the 50 shades series, but better written. Not as much S&M to read about, so I preferred it. The story line is good and she keeps you wanting to come back..... I a cannot wait for the next novel!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The characters in this book are so fabulous! Very intriguing twists and turns in the story plot. Borders on creepy, but interesting creepy! I couldn't put it down!
B0047WJ12K|1.0|I watched 45 minutes of this before deciding it was too boring to continue.  If you love CG effects and don't care about an interesting story, this movie is for you.  You have to wonder why an original, creative storyline is a rare animal in hollywood.
B008602KQI|1.0|Watching this made me feel that I had come into the story already past the halfway point, and that I had missed why the society was the way it was.  What a ripoff of so many better stories!  It's bland, tame, and passionless compared to the actual history of the Roman Empire.  None of the characters rise to the level of being either admirable or despicable, and Donald Sutherland is utterly wasted.  I will NOT be watching the sequels!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i am really enjoying and love the easy functions of this calculator.  enjoy the large keys makes it easy to use and read.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie and was prepared for the second to not be as great. Boy was I wrong. I think that the sequel topped the original for sure..... what a wonderful romp with action and witty dialogue galore.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Are you kidding, all 3 books kept me at the edge of my seat. Such interesting reading, Saw the movie of course we all know no justice to this writer. Awesome series!!
B002361MLA|4.0|While I like this book and its message I found it hard to get into. I tried A New Earth by Tolle and whizzed through that one--much more readable and personable. Same message.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|Never heard this full album and the remastered tracks are amazing. The extra set are a nice look on the underside of the doors.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I loved the book. It is very different from the movie. Movie is amazing too. It was difficult to pause reading so I could do get to my work. I would recommend this book for everyone who wants a good story to read and is interested in apocalyptic genre in books.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|i knew when i ordered book 2 i was sunk. book 1 was dreadful but i couldnt put it down...book 2 was better as i just skipped the completely stupid sex scenes but again, couldn't put it down so who is the loser here? i guess we both win that award.
B008POAQS4|5.0|Nothing is better than this show you don't even have to understand LAW to enjoy it. Best part is you get to watch the most recent episode as soon as it airs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again E L James is a captivating writer who writes from the heart and the humor is great. I look forward to more from her.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|This movie was excellent on all levels. It managed to delve into what might otherwise be considered 'dry history',highlighting many facts, names and relationships while still being very entertaining. All of the actors did an amazing job;especially Kate Blanchett. The costuming was first rate, as was the selection of of music. I had seen the movie several times before I purchased it, but I just had to own it.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|Very good movie! Don't let the english subtitles scare you off.<br /><br />Lots of action along with a very good story line
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A nice change in a plot. Kept me engaged and wanting to reach the end.  Although I found the beginning most interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed the whole series and really liked this book, but it was my least favorite of the three.  It was filled with endless violence which is usually not for me, but somehow worked in this book.  I have a pre-teen son and definitely would not want him reading this yet....just too graphic.  The changes in Peeta's personality added a lot to this ongoing story and I was happy with the final resolution.<br />This book offered lots of twists and surprises and kept me reading on to find out what other unexpected plot twists would happen.  I was sad to see the series end and my only complaint was that at times the descriptive made up words didn't always make sense to me and I know they were important to full understanding of the book.
B008M34CSI|4.0|Great special affects and good story line.  Love the Aussie actor Guy Pearce.  He has really buffed up and looks great. Prime for a sequel.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Simple puzzle game with simple logic to derive solutions.  Very easy play - TOO easy.  There have to be better, more engaging alternatives.
B001661RC2|5.0|IF YOU'VE FOUND OTHER BLACK KEYS' ALBUMS TO GET MONTONOUS, THIS IS GOING TO BE A SIGH OF RELEIF. INSTEAD OF THE STAPLE GUITAR AND VOCAL EFFECTS & STYLES, THIS RECORDING BACKS OFF THE CONSTANT HEAVINESS AND GIVES SOME MORE MELLOW, PSYCHEDELIC EXPRESSIONS. I WISH THEY WOULD DO MORE EXPANSIVE MUSIC LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE; IT REALLY SHOWS HOW BROAD THEIR TALENTS ARE. ENJOY IT MORE WITH EVERY LISTEN.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|This book was mildly enjoyable in itself as a novel, but it was most definitely not a prequel to Mazerunner other than that it's set in the world before the events of the Mazerunner series. It doesn't do anything to explain the events, characters, or mysteries in the later books. I can't recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the original series. It's certainly set up for ANOTHER prequel, which seems to me a cheap way for Dashner to sell more books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Never read anything like it, but it almost immediately grabbed me. Once it did I couldn't put it down.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I really don't know what all the hype was about, yes there was plenty of action in it but I didn't think it was well written. I got to about half way. I'd be somewhat curious to see how the story ends alright, but the writing came across as juvenile or forced in some way and I'm just not willing to spend the time reading it through to the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a Great book, i never wanted to put it down. I didn't think I'd be that interested in the topic but it grabs you.
B002ZG99IG|3.0|The main problem with the Roommate is that it doesn't set out to do anything that you've most likely already seen plenty of times in other suspense films involving a calm person starting out nice and innocent and eventually turning into a murder-happy psychotic nutcase the more comfortable they become with the object of their obsession.<br /><br />What makes this one worse than most is that the storyline is based around really forgettable writing concerning college kids that enjoy the party lifestyle, so it's harder to take these characters seriously which slowly but surely deteriorates the writing.  Any potential this movie could have had disappears with every predictable segment we're forced to watch.  This film never steps away from the predictability which is what clearly makes it inferior to other suspense films with the same concept.<br /><br />Crazy girl becoming obsessed with her roommate?  Check.  Crazy girl showing signs of controlling the person they're obsessed with by staying up late waiting for her roommate to come home from a date and inexplicably yell at her like a mother who's daughter is late for her curfew?  Check.  Crazy person kills a pretty kitty cat by putting it in the washing machine (or dryer) in a pitiful and desperate attempt to pretend to have sympathy which in turns just makes the obsession even stronger once the victims tearful weak side is revealed over the sad news and needs someone to comfort?  Sorry for the run-on sentence there, but it's all here!<br /><br />None of this is remotely compelling to me however, and if you've seen films such as the Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female, I highly doubt it will be compelling to you either.  I believe this film is directed for the younger crowd which is why the writers went with a college environment.  Adults will probably find this film severely lacking.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Very good music! Saw them in Newport R.I. at the Jazz festival and thought they were the best over all!
B007SGM084|2.0|I haven't even finished the first book yet, so I'm saying that potentially I dislike the series.  I had heard it was not exactly \\"well written\\" but even that doesn't matter much - what I don't like (so far) is the NON PLOT, the ridiculousness of the dialog, and the ludicrous, unbelievable (well, imho, of course) concept of a SEX contract.. and not just sex, but SUBMISSIVE sex.  I regret that I spent my hard-earned on this series, but it's because I DID spend money that I'll probably persevere and read it--in between reading books that I can relate to, books that I enjoy, books that I LOVE! Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against reading some steamy stuff (author Sue Miller comes to mind) but 50 Shades, so far, doesn't \\"do it\\" for me!!  If I could return it and get my money back, I would do so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books. I was hooked from the start. If you are squeamish about sex this may be an uncomfortable read but otherwise very tantalizing!!!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Stevenson was a classic author.  When authors like Robert Louis Stevenson write, the characters and scenes come to life in your mind. I recommend this story for young readers too.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|My daughter calls these types of books mind candy because they are written for teenagers, but I enjoy them. The writer makes Drizzt and the characters he meets so real.  Really fun reading.  You want to know what happens to Drizzt.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|This movie was beautifully directed and acted.  I became so engrossed in the movie that I forgot it was a silent movie.<br />It is true artistry.
B008602KQI|4.0|Awesome movie.  Although somethings were changed vs the book I still loved it. I can't wait for Catching Fire to come out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I couldn't put it down.  I don't typically read mysteries but this was well worth a read.  A good psychological thriller without being too far-fetched or gory.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Needed replacement for charger when old one chewed by my dog. This was the one I needed. Keeping this one out of reach.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this book was great. I loved the suspense and the characters. I am hooked on it!  I can't put it down waiting for the next move of the characters. It was captivating!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl:  A Novel was truly captivating.  Enjoyed all the twists and turns.  Great entertainment.  I look forward to reading more novels by Gillian Flynn.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Such a light and refreshing album. You should buy it. I liked it, and I think you will too. Also going to be great for road trips!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought I had read enough slave vs plantation owner stories.  However the unique perspective of a white Irish refugee girl who has lost her parents and becomes indentured to a slave owner adds a whole different view of the issues of the time.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Great read/ story but only if you're into this type of semi-historical fiction. I can see how some people say that its a bit boring, but if you like the subject; history & architecture & people, you'll love it. I really liked Pillars of the Earth and this one is just as good sort of.  For me the freshness of Pillars made it a bit better.  World Without End is similar and clearly shows Follett's skill in developing several inter-connected stories and his incredible attention to detail (he really does his research).  Remember that this is fiction so sometimes you just got to go with it.  I found myself very riveted by the book and entertained.  I recommend this book if you're into historical fiction.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really great book that meant a lot to me personally and I would recommend it to all of my friends!
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This Is good Book, that really just continues the story of Ruiz's previous book \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\". Well written, interesting content. A lot of historical information about the Spanish Civil War.  Not quite as intriguing as his previous books, but readers will still enjoy the characters and plot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put I town. I'm definitely not a reader but I read this 514 page book in about 5 days. I have other books that I have started but still haven't picked up to finish. This one is definitely top of the line!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure why everyone was excited about a book where children murder each other. After reading, I must say, the hype about the series is true. I'm glad a read these (twice).
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|The music on this album is great! Part classical, part modern. Classical enthusiasts will love this as well as opera enthusiasts. The music is fluid and melodic. I'd give this album a 10 out of 10!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|The first time I read this book I was in high school.  Our third year french class not only read the book; but also wrote a short play to perform for grade school students in our area.  I have shared this wonderful classic with my grown children and now am introducing my granddaughter to the amazing world of The Little Prince.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Best Fifty Shades, not just a sex book, but a good misery story as well. You have to read the other two book first, but this book is totally worth it (the first two books were okay to good, never great).
B008602KQI|5.0|I really loved the Hunger Games movie. There were a few things from the book that didn't make it in the movie, but there always is. I thought it was a great representation of the book with perfect casting. Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, and Elizabeth Banks were all especially perfect for their parts. & Josh Hutcherson did a great job as Peeta, as well. It was solid all the way around, and I can't wait for the second one to come out next Nov.!
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent and compelling story well filmed and acted.  The premise is intriguing and the possibility of sequels is a good idea
B000001DYA|2.0|I bought this cd thinking I remembered just how hot the band was, and how they were the progenitors of something that has since evolved into a wide genre of hard, loud, faster-than; I guess that all the drugs I did really colored my perspective.  I was hard-pressed to find ANYTHING that really spoke to me on this disc.  For those fans who can't imagine what I'm babbling about, sorry, no offense.  Just keep doing what yer doing. I know that I really dug INSIDE/OUTSIDE, so I guess my next move is to dig out the stereo and lp and see if that sentiment still holds true.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I really liked book 1 of Hunger Games, although I was surprised that it ended the way it did, up in the air, with a big fat \\"TO BE CONTINUED\\".  This is not a trilogy, this is one book that happens to be sold in 3 covers.<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games\\" told a compelling story.  However, \\"Catching Fire\\" just pounds you over and over with the sad stick.  To me, it was just way too contrived with disasters and unnecessary, intentional, unrelenting badness.
B008M34INW|5.0|dont ask me to review and then give me specifics of how you want it. its not about you. off
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great graphics.  Gives a lot of useful data in a very user friendly format.  Really helpful to see where you use the most battery life and how you can adjust it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my favorite book until I start the next I'm a single mom and sum how I find the time to finish the book in a few days. Buy it you will thank me laters baby!!!
0525953728|3.0|The controversy surrounding No Easy Day is completely unwarranted.  There is no obviously classified information in the book, and the vast majority of the details about the preparations, raid, and aftermath have already been reported elsewhere. The book is also pretty general. Frankly, the New Yorker article in August 2011 was more informative about the raid itself, and had the added benefit of being based on interviews with higher officials than this author had access to, so there was a more complete picture.<br /><br />No Easy Day was pretty insightful with regard to the current DEVGRU mindset, training, pranks, political challenges, and so on.  But it was anticlimactic after all the media hype surrounding its release.  The biggest revelation in the book has to do with Bin Laden's demise in that it contradicts the official account, but the author's description of how Bin Laden died won't be much of a surprise for people who have some familiarity with Special Mission Units like DEVGRU, Delta Force, the British SAS, and other units.  Other than that not much of the information about the operation is new.  More than half of the book is devoted to the author's other missions and training, but not enough detail is given about them so it seems like a run-of-the-mill special operations book that anyone could write.  No Easy Day certainly does not \\"set the record straight\\" about anything.  This was a disappointment; after all the drama in the media, I was expecting the author to make some big revelations about the operation, but I found that his account of the mission tracks pretty well with what has appeared elsewhere and was far from explosive.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews, I do take issue with the whole \\"he betrayed the code of silence\\" claim and other security-related criticisms.  I reviewed the official DoD non-disclosure agreement on classified information, the SF-312. The SF-312 does not go beyond existing federal law, which defines and criminalizes espionage. To summarize, a person cannot be criminally prosecuted for sharing information that is not harmful to the national defense, even if it is classified.  The author is not currently in the military so he doesn't have a security clearance to revoke and cannot be administratively disciplined.  At worst, he breached his contract by not submitting the book for review, but the damages are speculative at best because none of the information in the book could be used against the U.S. Everyone who would be interested, like foreign governments and terrorists, already knows where the DEVGRU base and other key facilities are, among other things.  If DEVGRU does not already have security measures in place for its personnel, then it is sorely remiss in its duties.  Overclassification is a serious concern, and I applaud the author for taking a stand for the proposition that this important operation, whose details have been leaked for ample political gain, is fair game to talk about in books.  At the same time, the author does not talk about any classified tactics or technology-- not even the stealth features of the Blackhawk helicopters used in the raid, even though the wreckage of the one that crash landed in Bin Laden's compound was photographed and written up in Aviation Week as revealing a previously unknown program.<br /><br />On another note, if anything the author is too modest in his account.  The book really downplays the Captain America-level performance so often attributed to units like DEVGRU, and it dilutes some of the mystique surrounding Special Mission Units by showing that luck and personality are just as important to an operator's mission success as actual ability.  I found that really interesting, but his lack of a big ego probably isn't typical among DEVGRU.<br /><br />In my opinion, a book called Rogue Warrior by Richard Marcinko, the founder of Seal Team Six/DEVGRU, was a better read about the SEALs and was more fun even though it was published in 1992.  There is also a book called Kill Bin Laden, which was written by a Delta Force commander about the battle of Tora Bora in 2001.  Either one will be at least as interesting to you as No Easy Day, and in my opinion you should spend your money there given that all of the spoilers in No Easy Day have now been reported in the media.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I considered myself fit...before starting this. Its hard but a great workout. You definitely feel sore the following day. Jillian does a good job of tailoring the workout for beginners up to advanced. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to work out at home. It says 20min workouts but they are really about 25mins long.
B0090EIILU|2.0|I'd been looking forward to seeing this one. I even checked local theaters about 6 weeks after it started playing and was surprised to see it was no longer playing here (Las Vegas). That should have made me suspicious. I think SBC is a fantastic talent and have loved all his work up until Dictator. Unfortunately, his foray into pure fiction was a disaster. After a reasonably strong start, this film falls into predictable, mildly humorous moments that added up to my fighting to stay awake and then giving up entirely. SBC you get one more crack at pure fiction, and if it fails again you need to go back to the fool them once worlds of Ali G, Borat, and Bruno that provided me with some of the most entertaining video moments of my life. One star is for the first 20 minutes and the other is for the beard.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Don't start unless you have a lot of time to kill - it sucks you in and won't let you go!
0307592731|3.0|I was very interested in reading Wild once I found out that it was an autobiography of a woman who hiked the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) by herself when she was in her mid-20s. It sounded like a truly incredible story. The self-account is well-written, but I have to admit that I found myself wanting it to come to an end. The author, Cheryl Strayed, is extremely candid about her life- the good, the bad and the ugly, which makes it hard to read at times because her decisions (at the time that her hike took place in the mid 90s), were not the wisest. I did enjoy her insight into what it took to hike a trail for over 190 days as a woman, but overall I was just trying to get to the last page and be done with the book because I couldn't make peace with/relate to some of the things Cheryl did as part of her journey. If you're looking for a good read about hiking a trail, try Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. It's his story of hiking the Appalachian Trail with a high school buddy and is much more entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Hunger Games.  It's a well written story, that just keeps moving.  There's good character development and you can certainly become attached to them.  Highly recommend.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie - definitely read the book first so you understand things they don't explain in the movie, but even without reading the book the movie would be great!
B0023SDPS6|2.0|I have enjoyed the TV series, Longmire, & I thought the books on which the series is based would be as good or better than the series. However, I was very disappointed by the language in the book. My experience is people do not use that kind of language in everyday conversation. It is not necessary in order to tell a good story. Consequently, I will not be purchasing anymore of the Walt Longmire Mysteries by Craig Johnson.
B0086DBE62|3.0|This was a \\"new\\" version of Snow White and it came up short.  It was more like watching a stage play rather than a movie.  The stars couldn't make this movie any better.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The three book series went from very interesting, to mildly interesting to somewhat disappointing. I was excited to read the first book, enjoyed the second book and wondered what I was doing reading the third book
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was sad that the book ended. Great writing. I enjoyed the story line. I wished it was longer. I have not read the other books and probably will never read them. I read reviews for the other books in the series and was  disappointed of the other books. I want to remember Ender and his game, always.
B000U7VTCG|3.0|\\"Neon Bible\\" isn't a bad album by any stretch. That being said, it's not nearly as cohesive, poignant or profound as both \\"Funeral\\" & \\"The Suburbs.\\" There are still some stellar standout tracks, such as \\"Leave the Car Running,\\" \\"No Cars Go,\\" and \\"Intervention,\\" but the overall package isn't quite as compelling as their others.<br />Still worth a listen here & there, but doesn't quite have the staying power I've become accustomed to from their other releases.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A friend highly recommended this book to me because I am having marital issues with my wife and we're close to calling it quits. After reading the first three chapters I bought another copy to give to my wife to read. We both enjoyed it.<br /><br />We started counseling a couple of weeks ago and when I told the counselor we've read the 5 Love Languages, she was excited for us. She institutes a little bit of the book into our counseling sessions and used it as a baseline for our first session.<br /><br />The book showed me ways to communicate/love in a language my wife understands. It's teaching her that it's not helpful to us for her to keep bringing up past events and harping on the negative if we're to make our relationship work. The best part is the books gives real situational examples and teaches you how to judge your spouse without being judgmental.
B008602KQI|5.0|The DVD was very cool. The case is pretty and it arrived on time (unfortunately, class had started up by then and I wasn't able to watch it right away).<br /><br />The movie itself is awesome. It's a very good adaptation of a book. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. It's one of my favorite movies. It makes sense even if you haven't read the book. Since the Hunger Games are broadcast on essentially national television, this allows the announcers of the games to pause and explain things to people who haven't read the books without feeling unnatural. Mainly the broadcast is geared toward pleasing the Capitol audience (those in the Districts aren't really given a choice in watching it), and it's conceivable that the Capitol audience wouldn't know exactly what say trackerjackers were.<br /><br />Overall, it's a  very good movie and fans of the book should watch and love it. Relatively few things were left out or skipped over. The story of the Mockingjay pin is changed and Katniss does not drug Peeta in the cave. There is also significantly less bloodshed and suffering in the arena, probably done to keep a PG-13 rating. However, the thing to remember is that the author of the books was on the screenplay team and presumably had a hand in all of the changes. While the dialogue is not always straight out of the book and some scenes are shortened, it does capture the spirit of the book extraordinarily well.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it.
1932735410|5.0|This book is must have for anyone studying for the PMP exam.  Rita's book offers many practice tools, advice, and plenty of practice questions in each chapter.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Did not disappoint. There were a few little things that were left out of the movie but still great movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love having this app but it does need a little work! I would like to be able to edit my boards using the app instead of going through the browser.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was one if my favorite books to read this summer. The author did a great job of getting you excited and interested in every new twist and turn. You can tell the author is knowledgable in history and you end up learning so much more than you thought you would. I literally couldn't put this book down and ended up stating up until the wee hours of morning reading. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The film was very predictable but it didn't take away from the action of it. Overall worthy to see movie.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|i love it!i would like to get the first 2 books of the series and i plan on getting the ones that came after this although the 2nd one is out of print.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book continued to drag just like the first one.  Many things I could think of to add excitement besides just sex in another place.  About every 50 pages we get one piece of plot the rest is all sex.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers had me wishing for more. I wasn't ready for the story to end. Riveting from Page 1, you will not be able to put this book down. The main character is so strong, yet extremely fragile; a study in contrast in so many ways. Creativity and destruction working side-by-side within herself. Which side will define her?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great Puzzle Game!!! My daughter downloaded this game on my kindle fire for her to play Lol :D  I didn't even what it was Lol. The Easy to hard levels makes it fun for ALL!!!! We enjoy it together :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book starts out slow, but once you get into about 30% of the book it really starts to peak your interest. If you don't like a book that flips back and forth between present and past you might not enjoy this read.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great follow up to the first two. The book isnt supposed to be some sort of intellectual masterpiece. It is simply a nice \\"romantic\\" story with some pizazz. I can honestly say I will miss these two characters. I would love for the author to write it from Christians perspective..I really enjoyed the ending where she wrote from his perspective.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|what happens when the former drummer of DT hooks up with the guitar player from Deep Purple  you get  Flying Colors  another supergroup that will be around for a very long time long as they stay true to there form
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the triolby twice.  Book one was given to me as a gift, after reading it in only one day, i couldn't waait to buy book 2 and three, i couldn't put it down.  I absolutely this book.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|two long time veteran classic rockers come together to produce in my opinion a long enduring classic cd that will stand the test of time.. Would be nice to see a tour in the near future of these men preforming this album live
068981528X|1.0|I did not like this story at all.  I found it disturbing.  The pig smashes the wolves' houses with a sledgehammer, then a pneumatic drill.  The wolves build a house that looks like a cross between a bank vault and a prison, complete with barbed wire, which is destroyed when the pig uses dynamite to blow it up.  This is just not my kind of humor.  I was looking for a cute/funny story for my kids and this was not it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the movie, I just wish that amazon would have had the bluray/dvd combo.  It also arrived August 20th instead of the 18th.  I bought two copies one for myself and one for my niece.  My niece got her copy the day it was released and mine did not arrive until two days later.  The movie itself is great.  If you liked the books you will like the movie.  The movie surprisingly does not have a lot of gore.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|I FINISHED SEEING ALL FILMS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE OF 2011 AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS AND THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST PICTURE AND THE YOUNG BOY SHOULD HAVE WON BEST ACTOR AND HE WAS NOT EVEN NOMINATED.ENOUGH SAID.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|I give American Horror Story 5 stars... Love everything about the show. Can't wait for the next season to start. Would have liked to have seen more of the first season in the second season cast but, variety is the spice of life.. Right?
B0000009RT|5.0|I have been living with enough creative tension to think of a hellfire harmonica society in which the vocal of Trouble Every Day ends with: Play your harmonica, Son. The comic spark symphony will only start when everybody automatically thinks that hellfire harMonica Lewinsky had more life than anything that will ever be legislated.<br /><br />I like the one song so much that those who do not have Trouble Every Day implanted in their heads hardly seem capable of thinking the kind of history that makes trouble the inspiration for hellfire. Life before Y2K had some interest that is missing for those who never put the harm in harmonica.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|most of the actors Ive never heard of before, dialog and plot were confusing, special effects were great, the conclusion showed the twist ending
B008OOYALE|4.0|its alot of fun to play-however it takes a while to get started.  I enjoy interacting with others-and the graphics are alot of fun!
B001MSMULG|4.0|Daniel Silva is a rising star among \\"spy\\" thrillers. While he has written many novels, I am a new convert to him. His writing is like watching a blockbuster movie, you just don't know what is going to happen next. I just wish some of the art work mentioned could be included, for me it would add a little more enjoyment to the books.
1476712042|5.0|This book was great! Didnt want to put it down. I rarely ever read books and when I do it ususally takes me months to finish. Because I could find a million other things to do. This book was so good I couldnt put it down. I had it read in 2 days! Love the characters. Can't wait for the next book! If you loved the characters and history of 50 Shades of Grey then you will love this one!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Not as good as the first and my entire family loved the first one.  Ok for a rainy day with nothing to do
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series and can hardly put the book down. It is full of adventure and is intriguing. You never know what surprise will be revealed as you go to the next page.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|This book was utter rubbish, I can't believe I fell for the hype and bought it, the first one in the series was bad enough, why did I spend time and money for this nonsense! I couldn't read it after 50 or so pages, I can't stand the inner goddess vs subconscious debate, what a WASTE OF TIME! And so poorly written...the worst book ever!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I found \\"11/22/63\\" to be excellent reading.  I always look forward to a new Stephen King book but I hesitated to read<br />this book when it first came out; too many bad, old memories.  However, after getting my Kimble G, I decided to try<br />It.  I was pulled into the plot, identified with the main characters and found myself squirming in all the tight<br />situations.  Stephen King brings the characters to life and It felt as though he was telling this story \\"face to face\\".<br />I would recommend \\"ll/22/63\\" to anyone who likes adventure, mystery and mild fantasy combined with a touching<br />love story.
B008602KQI|5.0|I received the movie in a timely manner.  It was great that I also recieved access to watch it on line after midnight of the day of release.  Kids really enjoyed it.  Thanks
B008602KQI|5.0|Very well done, especially when you consider all that they had to live up to because the book was so detailed.  If we hadn't read the book before seeing the movie, there are things that might not have made as much sense.  Overall, we really enjoyed it & are looking forward to the next Hunger Games movie!
B008602KQI|5.0|This film was a phenomenal film.  I was glad that I pre-ordered it so I was guaranteed to get it.  The only thing that I did not like was that I did not get it on the release date.  I had to wait a few days after that.  I am not sure how to rectify this in the future for new products.  Otherwise, the services were great and the product itself is amazing.
B007SGM084|5.0|If you are going to read Fifty Shades of Grey you might as well buy the trilogy because you won't be able to stop after the first book!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was intoxicating.  I could not put it down.  I would definately read again.  It took me a while to come back to reality after I finished.  It made me feel like I was in the story watching the character's and their lives unfold.  The story flowed well with not a lot of time spent on discriptions of the surroundings, which sometimes bores me.  You got to know the character's and easily took on their feelings.
B007JRUCGO|1.0|This movie once again proves how hard it is to make a good sequel. This was a disappointing two hours we would have been better off to have watched that documentary about the emperor penguins which I can't even remember the name of.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the other Hunger Games books, they kept my attention throughout the series and made me wanting more. I would strongly recommend the Hunger Games series.
B000VHPXR2|5.0|This is the music from one of the best rock opera's ever written. The cast is fantastic.  Both Mary and Judas stand out! The music is great
B007KZY1YY|3.0|It's a Mills & Boons kind of a love story with loads of sex ! How can anyone have sex every 5 minutes? read the book if you want to learn about 50 or may be 150 different ways to have sex!
0345803493|5.0|I love this trilogy it's been dark and lite keeps you intrested that for sure! Ya never really know what Fifty is thinking!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Each book is better and better! I love the Kindle book editions, I can read for hours and never get tired. I am looking forward to the fourth book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was not what I expected. My friends had read it and kept telling me I needed to read it too. I started and could hardly put it down then once I was finished with the first I could hardly wait to start on the next, I'm now on the third chapter of that one and so far it's even better!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is one of the best Harry Bosch books.  Learning about his mother was great and makes this a very human experience.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|There are very few movies that I found made about the Jane Austen's Persuassion book and this one starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds was done very well.  The actors did a spendid job in each of their assigned parts and the script was well selected.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|the best one so far, I've really enjoyed this book. More perspectives and characters to get to know.  I'm becoming addicted to this series... just in time for school.
B005OP2928|5.0|only 2 things to say:<br /><br />1) Buy this is you liked season 1 and 2.<br />2) This is no better and no worse than either season 1 or 2.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was having trouble using pinterest on my kindle fire, and this app completely fixes the problem! thanks so much to the creators of this app!
B00846TTDG|4.0|It was definitely dramatic when you know the content is accurate portrayal of our brave soldiers.  The sacrifice both the service member and their families make is profound but with all sincerity appreciate their service beyond words.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great overall movie. Very interesting film opening you up to a different world Filled with joy, tragedy and unique characters.
B008602KQI|5.0|Everybody who read the books first, super enjoyed the movie.  I didn't read the book first but saw the movie in the theater and couldn't wait for my physical copy.  I'm very pleased with how fast the movies can come out on DVD now.  I have a Plasma large screen TV and absolutely loved this movie, once again.  It's a great film and one that I believe everybody should see.  I received my digital copy via Amazon, as a pre-order and so that I could watch it the day the blue ray was released. Then the physical copy just two days later.  This movie is a must see.  Although futuristic, it sort of seems the way the country is currently headed -government run.  I love Amazon!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It was a good book, but I think it was more for the teenage group. It did keep my attention.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the Hunger Games trilogy and enjoyed them immensely. I thought it would be very difficult to bring this to the big screen.  I was wrong.  This is a great movie.  Of course some of the details had to be omitted in the screen version, but there were also enhancements I enjoyed.  Like the scenes showing the game people at work and their environment.  Looking forward to the next two movies.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  In the end, I'm happy I read it.  It's a profound story told in a very matter of fact way.  I liked that it was written by a previous journalist. While you knew which side he was on, he presented the information as factual, making it a much different read from an autobiography of someone who had been in the same situation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good story.  Gets you interested from the beginning and you can't stop reading!! I highly recommend this series.  They are budget friendly at Amazon!
B006I1OB0U|5.0|The first copy of the Blu-Ray I purchased from another vendor was less expensive, but the sound only worked about 1/2 the time.
B007YQ6SYK|4.0|I enjoyed this album! Easy to listen and sing to once you know some of the words. I like the gentle and soulful sound as he relates his stories. Buy it! You'll like it!
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Zafon is always a great read and story line combines great suspense with a touch of the exotic. Highly recommended
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent story. very well written , draws you into the characters lives. I was sorry when it was over. I would love to see it a TV series on HBO or something like that.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Nice efficient interface and updates all news easily as opposed to individual topics. Smooth sliding color photos shown to summarize text.
B008602KQI|5.0|I went to the Hunger Games movie at 9:30am the first day and went two more times. I am 63 years old and had read all 3 books in about 2 weeks time. I hadn't finished any book in years. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss and I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting of Woody Harrelson. I love the Hemsworth brothers (Liam and Chris) so that was another plus. As the cast of Catching Fire is being announced I know I will be reading the books again since the sequel won't be out until November 2013. I bought a copy of this movie for myself and for a Christmas present. My copy is currently being passed around my water aerobics class since some of the seniors have read the books but not seen the movie. I recommend this movie very highly
B000KI6286|5.0|Wow what a candid and funny parody of the extremes of business. This is a cult classic. W o w I t w a s f u n.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|I was disapointed in this last installment of the american pie franchise.. It just wasn't that funny.. Good think stifler was in it or else I would have given it 0 stars
B00846REIS|3.0|This is a well written book.  The author has talent.  The read was enjoyable.  But I'd recently finished the Shades of Grey trilogy.  Either much of this was simply ripped from those books or all romance novels are the same plot.  I read Shades for the BDSM as well as all the buzz.  It did not disappoint. It too was well written and enough BDSM to be interesting though hardly a legitimate BDSM book.  Crossfire has no BDSM and a very thin plot.  The male lead in both cases is very young, very rich and suffered childhood abuse.  The female lead meets the hearthrob by falling down in front of them in both books.  Will I read the sequel due out in October?  Probably.
B005USZML4|3.0|This book was just okay.  It was'n't like John Grisham's other books, and I was more than a little disappointed.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Finally someone has had the courage to take on the government's recommended food rules. Just try Dr. Davis advise - it will change your life!
B005USZYDU|3.0|This book wasn't like John Grisham's other books, but it was much better than \\"The Abduction.\\"  Don't think I'll read any moreTheodore Boone books.
B001EBWITA|4.0|I don't know why people give this movie such a hard time.  I admit, fantasy action horror movies are not my favorite genre as I'm typically partial to artsy, pretentious indie movies that claim to be provocative.  However, I was pretty surprised how entertained I was by \\"Constantine\\".  I don't know the source material as I don't read comic books nor do I feel that comic book movies are typically very good, but \\"Constantine\\" manages to put together a pretty fascinating universe that's based on Christian mythology.<br /><br />The best aspect of the movie is how it doesn't go too far in any direction.  Keanu Reeves plays the anti-hero who does good, but for selfish reasons.  Weisz plays the love interest, but is never pushed into an awkward kiss/sex scene.  And Reeves, while successful, is not ridiculously invincible.<br /><br />Obviously fans disagree with me, but I have a hard time understanding why crap like \\"Fantastic Four\\" or even the much less crappy \\"The Dark Knight\\" are rated higher than this one.  If you like comic book movies (or hell, if you were raised Catholic), you really should see this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|This film was incredibly well made, and a very good adaption of the book. While others may critique the lack of violence as compared to the books, I felt they did the best they could without having to have an \\"R\\" rating.<br /><br />The product itself was great, as, the now standard and easy digital copy was a breeze to transfer.  Most importantly, the making of extras on this set are fantastic, especially the interviews with Donald Sutherland, who you could tell really cared for the role quite a bit.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Season Four is pretty stressful for me to watch.  Dexter just has so many balls in the air and he is lying to so many people: Rita, Deb, Quinn, and everyone else in the office.<br /><br />The episodes are great and compelling to watch, but doggone it did they ever ratchet up the drama this season.  And the season finale was a huge shocker.  No spoilers from me, but W-O-W!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it did a passable job of getting book to screen but now that I've seen it a few times on DVD I now think it's a pretty good movie all on its own. I thought Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job. She is a really good actor. I've watched the movie with people who have not read the book and they enjoyed it as well so it's not like you have to read the book to enjoy the movie. All in all, I think it's a solid B and I eagerly await the next movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you didn't see it in theaters, The Hunger Games is an excellent movie.  As is usually tha case, the movie doesn't capture all of the novel on which it is based.  Having read all three books of the series, and watching the movie a few times, I still believe the Movie is very well done, very well acted, and certainly fulfills its purpose:  Entertain the audience.  There is violence, drama and suspense, however, the level of violence and blood is kept pretty low.  This movie is not for young children.  Each parent has to make their own dertermination as to what is appropriate for the age and maturity of their children.  If this is a concern for you, then watch the movie before allowing your children to watch it.<br /><br />I highly recomend reading the book.  It makes the movie better.<br /><br />This is a story of corrupt central government, or dictatorship, supressing the population of the country, (divided into \\"districts\\")by keeping them poor, close to starving, and denied the opportunity for wealth or personal gain.  The only indulgance is that every home has a good TV.  Of course, all programming comes from the government.  The \\"Hunger Game\\" is an annual event to commerate a previous uprising of the people.  Katniss may just cause more than a little uprising.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008ENNXQI|5.0|Very cute and well done adaptation of the classic Snow White story.  Funny and sweet family movie that can be enjoyed by young and old.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of the best books I have read lately.  As soon as I finished it, I started it again.  Cute and easy read.  I even recommended it to my mother and she fell in love as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was sad that the book ended.  I loved the trilogy of fifty shade.  This book has improved my marriage and sex life tremendously. I learned so much from Christian and Anna and all thanks to the author EL James.  She really outdid herself with all the details.  The details provides a fantasy world for us married women that lack imagination.  Men have their porn to watch and now we have something to read!  I would love to meet the author someday and thank her personally for writing so well and so detailed for womenkind..
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Even if I grow up with 21 jump street in tv I never had the chance to watch it, but I was pretty septic about this movie, I thought it would just another kind of funny movie but at the end I really enjoyed it, suprisingly funny, with a lot of action and both actor are great in their role
B008RJFRTK|1.0|This app has less value than my 5 year old outdated GPS. I can't search for specific street addresses which makes it only as valuable as a paper street map for me in my line of work. Wast of $5. I want my money back! Should have read ALL of the reviews.
B00846TTDG|2.0|We didn't really like this movie, at first we were enthusiastic, but at the end we found this movie pretty much boring and without interest.
B000YJ85BI|3.0|This book, a sequel to Old Man's War, wasn't up to par with the former.  The book was o.k. but not as imaginative for my taste.
1466401885|5.0|I bought this book with little expectation one way or the other. I needed something to read, period. I am really surprised at how much I liked this story. Its been a while since I read a story where the female character didn't make me want to roll my eyes every other chapter. Abby aka Pigeon was a believable girl ( for her age ) and circumstance. I loved Travis and all his imperfections. I liked that the main character list was kept small and the outer characters were not overly explained. I highly recommend this book.
B0068C9W44|5.0|I wish I bought the clean version, I have to skip the title track and a few others or listen to it alone without my 4 year old. I love the cd anyway...would recommend! Great price on Amazon!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|good movie good story wonderful scenery good acting will watch it again cant wait for the next one worth the watch
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This book was a great read as are all her books!  Looking forward to the next book in this series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Folks that don't particularly like King will like this book. The mystery of the Kennedy assassination fascinates and the story is complete enough to keep the reader involved without having to suspend too much disbelief.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Oh well what more to add to what as been previously written. Compared to the other 2 the 3rd book of the hunger games is somewhat of a disappointment. Basically you go through the book because you truly want to know what happens to Peeta. And then in the end, you just get sad on the way Katniss sees her life. She just looks bored... \\"oh let's have a baby because Peeta wants\\"... \\"oh let's jump out of a bridge because Peeta wants\\"... there is no driven passion anymore. So you go till the end exactly because of that... you want closure.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|You cannot stop watching this movie - it holds your attention from start to finish. I didn't think I'd like it because of the premise, but once I got past that and the initial scene at the cornocopia (if it scares you try to look away for a minute), the story just grabbed me and wouldn't let go. Absolutely fascinating.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the first two books in nothing flat. Book 3 was very good also. I enjoyed the first two the most, but Fifty shades freed answers many questions, and really ties all three books together in a very nice conclusion. Very good read, very pleased, very happy I chose this for my Kindle fire. Love it! Highly recommend!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is going to be part an explosive series!  Sanderson has now matched or exceeded that of George martin.  He does such a good job creating the characters and setting us up for a surprising read.<br /><br />I'd you haven't read the mistborn trilogy I also recommend taking a look at that as well.  He has now become my favorite author by far.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wow...what a surprise. Wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book. Cheryl you are an amazing woman!I felt as if I was on the trail with you...I could visualize your poor feet, feel your pain and anguish, cheering with you at your accomplishment. Amazing amazing story and achievement...couldn't put mt kindle down. Just purchased Tiny Beautiful Things...can't wait to read it. Keep writing Cheryl!
B008UO7WB8|5.0|I love it!  I have two kids and most of the time, I can't get my shows on time.  So by purchasing it on Amazon, I could watch it whenever I want and wherever I want... On my laptop, Kindle, etc. It's soo convenience!
B002DD67XG|5.0|Bought this CD for a couple of tracks, and did not realize all the songs on it that I knew and loved.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Great concept and story . . . But you can't really expect less from Neil Gamon, he's just brilliant. The story has been Masterfully made into  movie format. It's an especially helpful concept for alienated parents although I hate to soil the beautiful film by associating it as such, because it really is a stand alone masterpiece.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is great. Just wished it could have gone into as much detail as the books. But, I know that is how it usually goes with books made into movies.
B00846REIS|1.0|After reading 50 shades.. this book doesn't even come close. I wouldn't recommend, in fact after reading this book, I didn't even go on to the next book that follows it..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book it's the best ever. I have read all the Hungers Games and this is the last I think it going to be a great book!!!!!
B0073CNGCC|5.0|I rank this up there with Pride and Prejudice and all the best MASTERPIECE CLASSICS. The acting is impeccable and the costumes are perfection.<br />A really wonderful production- and although it leaves you wanting more- each episode is a full story unto itself.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book, after being toted as \\"shocking\\" by so many readers, was little more than poorly written erotic repetition.  Nothing in this book was shocking.  And, to be fair, some of the scenes were kind of hot, over all the erotic benefits of the book were killed by the repetitive nature of the prose.  It felt like it was written by a high school student, right down to the 20 dollar words thrown into it.  Someone was writing with a thesaurus...
B001NKI60W|5.0|This movie and music never fails to cheer me up. Wonderfully filmed in the Greek Isles with music by Abba and Meryl Strepp taking the lead. Get it for the women in your life or for yourself!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Literary masterpiece?  No.  Lots of fun?  Yes.  Bone up on your pop culture before reading this.  A tour de force of geek fiction.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie. I know I will watch it many times. There are a lot of extras on the DVD that I haven't watched yet.a great purchase.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|Who knew Harry Potter could act? \\"The Woman in Black\\" is a good Gothic ghost story that's worth the time. Suspenseful, dark, brooding...essential ingredients in any thriller and TWIB doesn't disappoint.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The book contained very little action or resolution but lots of details on certain characters, especially Cersei. Not my cup of tea.
B000Q76K1A|3.0|While there is a lot of action in this movie, it fails to live up to the expectations of those who enjoyed the fabulous book by Robert Ludlum.  While movies based on novels often fall short, Harry Potter being an exception, this rendition of the novel ignores major plot points created in the book.  That said, if you've never read the book, or can ignore the temptation to make comparisons to Ludlum's work, this is still an action movie that fans of that genre may enjoy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! Always jobs to do to level up quicker! Very addictive! Wish the energy wouldn't run out so fast but its a great game!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|The video quality of the movie was phenomenal. I felt like I was watching it in theatres again-great display and sound as well. I highly recommend it; worth every penny!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Looks pretty. Too bad it did not work. when I opened it the time read two colon's with the number 64 and was counting seconds. The actual time was 9:44pm.  never could make it show correctly. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a diverting summer read--well-written with an ambitious structural gimmick that works for the first 3/4 of the book.  Unfortunately, the ending--which needs to be truly compelling--gets chewed up instead by the very \\"machinery\\" that Flynn has so cleverly constructed. Disappointing.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love this app, it helps me close down my other apps so I can continue them. I also like this app cause it shows me what is running. It helps me keep apps closed to save my battery.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|This movie is a blast from the past. Its got great humor. John Canddy at his best. A very funny movie. Dont miss this one if ya havent seen it. If ya have watch it again. Very funny flick.
B008602KQI|5.0|Even as a book Hunger Games kept me on the edge of my seat. The author pulls off an impressive combination of gutwrenching suspense, heartbreaking tragedy and even subtle romance. But while the first person POV provided mystery and realism, it also presented some limitations. Then along came the movie, filling in the gaps and then some! I felt like a kid in a candy store, going behind the scenes to see the gamemaker's headquarters and even footage of different districts around panem. To put it in Layman's terms, Collins presents us with another world. Ross expands upon and deepens the immersion.<br /><br />It's quite an experience!<br /><br />I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie. It really amped up the enjoyment I took from both products. (Plus its super cheap on amazon anyway! )<br /><br />As for target audience? I'd recommend Hunger Games to just about anyone simply because it has something for everyone from adventure lovers to romance buffs. You'll find something to love and someone to root for.<br /><br />ABOUT DOWNLOADING MOVIES ON AMAZON: This service was not as dazzling as the movie itself, so I did not change the stars based upon it, but you should know that Amazon movies require you to download a separate video player which runs off of windows media but doesn't have as many features. So that's how it works. Download the movie, then the player and the player will keep your collection of movies for you. I can't even find the actual movie file in my computer so don't get any dreamy ideas of opening it with any other program. Features are limitted and I find that very annoying.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I liked the fact that he is in this huge band but still grounded...
B0086T6XQ2|5.0|It's sometimes hard for me to understand the dialog but overall this is a most enjoyable show.  It has humor, suspense and a right-on characters as Sherlock and Watson.
B004SBX112|5.0|The game leads everyone to understand physics and energy. The various birds give different options and the necessity to think and use resources in different ways.<br />.
0525953728|5.0|Coming from a military background. It was nice to get the real story from a real seal. Glad to see most of the profit going to vertern help. Highly recommend this book for all people!
B0039O8AQK|4.0|This book/movie has been iconic for futuristic predictions which sadly are coming true today.  the film is obviously old with old style film features but that is not a reason to avoid this film.  The things that occur in this film are eerily similar to what we are seeing today such as thought crimes, constant war, spying on citizens, marshal law, break down of families.  I would highly recommend you watch this film and see the end result of what is to come unless we work to bring real change in this world.  This won't happen in the political arena.  We need to be the change we want to see in the world.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Fun Book.  Very futuristic.  Well written and keeps you wondering how it will end.  Can't wait to read a sequel to this story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Absolutely loved all the twists in this novel.  They never quit.  It was capturing from the beginning.  Couldn't put it down and enjoyed every bit of it to the end!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|At first I was skeptical about this book because if the 50 shades fad going on and a lot of people were comparing it to that. I am so gla I decided to give BD a chance. I fell in love with the characters and the interesting journey they had to take. As an avid reader of supernatural and fantasy young adult books this was a welcome reprieve. I could honestly say that I could read this book over and over again. I'm counting down the days for her next book which is told from a different characters perspective. A very well written young adult novel.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Could not believe how stupid and horrible this movie was. To have a big name actress as Julia Roberts I was very disappointed!!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Sister was slowly engrossing and became riveting.  I read it in a weekend - couldn't put it down. Love the twist.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I'm not a big TV person but I love this show. Can't wait for more! Bring out the dead. Give me a crossbow.
B008602KQI|1.0|This is a very said movie and one that kids should not be seeing, what does it mean to have kids hunting and killing other kids? To me it's pretty sick and unbelibale that it's marketed to a young audience.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a great story, well told, about a man who changed our world drastically.  I couldn't put this book down!  The insights into the life of Steve Jobs truly changes the way you think about Apple products.  I have always been an android guy, but Steve is making me feel guilty and I might have to switch to Apple!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|whatever your hobby or obsession happens to be, you will find all of the world's unique ideas right here! Enjoy
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was expecting more from this book because of all of the hype it was getting in the media.  The plot was mediocre, by this I mean it was very predictable.  The sex scenes in the book were a little over the top and made the book really stand out.  I wish the writing would have been better.  I knew by the first chapter that this was a glorified harlequin book.  I have not read the other two books yet, I am just not interested right now.  I hope they turn out to be better than the first.  I would say it is worth the read just so an opinioned can be formed about it.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Definitely worth a read if you like fantasy but in a more brutal, character-focused way.  The whole series is not lighthearted, but without a doubt a consistent character portrayal.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie and story line .good to see that movies getting better.would watch in bluray but also good if you do not.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Entertaining and light. I like the characters. They have chemistry and the world they live in is so much fun to read about. Will definately read more of the books in the series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games have been fun, but there are a couple that are designed poorly. I will continue enjoying the good ones though.
B007P1INW4|5.0|Such a good episode. The tension builds and mounts as they deal with a pretty serious, and frighteningly true to our world, case. All this seriousness doesn't stop the overarching story though, when things get serious for Castle, as he gets caught with a bomb of his own. All in all an amazing episode, for an amazing show.
B008602KQI|3.0|I sat through the whole movie in 2 settings. It was boring and really too unbelievable. The ending also left a lot to be desired. I would not recommend it as a must see movie. I really wish I had just rented it.
B005NB5RWM|5.0|This film is great! I have seen many civil war films,but this war film has to be the nearest thing to the real thing.[[ASIN:B005N4F48Q Gettysburg: Extended Edition]]
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you don't have a lot of time to play, beware - this game is VERY addictive!! My 4 year old loves it too.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie starts out a little slow, but the action picks up and never stops. I was on the edge of my seat watching all the action going on. It took a lot of genious to do this movie. I loved it! Can hardly wait for the second one.
B008YYCUES|5.0|Each new show is great and since I download each on I can watch as often and whenever I want to....enjoy
B005AKFXZW|3.0|First of all I have to admit I didn't finish this book so this is more a first impression and not a full review. Also keep in mind that I'm probabaly not amongst the target audience that Morgenstern had in mind when she wrote this book. For me it reads like a teenage goth girl 101 type book (me beeing a 27 year old male) to be read along Nail Gaiman. I like how the writing style fits with the mystic tone of the book. Perhaps the reason I didn't feel I 'got it' is because that's what Morgenstern was going for. However, I cannot say I really liked this book, but I didn't hate it either. It an OK read. But if you like gothic storytelling I would think it pretty good.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Jack Reacher is on a roll in this one! For me, I loved having the people from his past come up in this book so we can see how he belonged to this family that was the MP special unit.  Love Jack Reacher!
B006LSZECO|1.0|By the time I finished this book, I disliked both the main characters very much.  Also, the ending was extremely disappointing.  Don't waste your time.
B005F2BBLK|1.0|It seems like a unique, creative idea lost its way in the production process resulting in a collection of disjointed events and discombobulated humor.
B004GNFSO0|3.0|This was a fascinating book and one of the most interesting escape stories that I have ever read.  There were parts of the story that did not seem to be true; crossing the Gobi desert for several days without water, crossing mountain ranges without climbing equipment, seeing sasquatch, etc.  I did some further investigation after finishing the story to find that there are serious historical questions about this account.  I do not think that this book should have \\"true story\\" in the description.  I still recommend the book.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I could almost feel the pain of Harold's blisters as I read of his journey.  I highly recommend this story of personal discovery.
B008602KQI|3.0|the movies was alright but it seemed be nothing more that a modern love story set around the hunger games,it might me  fine  for some people but personally i did not like it much at all
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed every page of it.  I couldn't stop reading and I couldn't stop thinking.... The story is beautifully woven and surprises the reader. It is not a fiction book as I had thought at the beginning but mostly a book about politics. The Greek mythology comes to life with the idea of the girls and boys being reaped for sacrifice to the powerful Capitol. And what happens next is very realistic. It could happen in our world!
B000VDUWMC|4.0|I thought that this was a fantastic book explaining the history of man on different continents.  The format of the book kept me very interested going from the basis of food production to all the outlying factors in the success or lack of success in different human civilizations.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|A friend told us this movie was scary and awesome. It was neither.  Whoever came up with this should just quit their job, cuz they suck at it.
B005V4X8JA|5.0|The best edition of this classic album I've ever heard - including first-press vinyl- taken from the master tape has held up well.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|I love the series and seeing them older with adult issues but still reminiscing about things they did in high school; hit home.
B00846REIS|2.0|I read this after the 50 shades trilogy hoping for something similar but not exactly the same. I swear you could change the names to Christian and Anastasia and it would fit in right after the second book.<br />In all fairness, this novel was written much better in terms of mechanics and composition compared to 50 shades (which was horribly written).<br />In the end I was hoping for a new story line but got the same young multi millionaire falls for the unlikely plain Jane. Oh and plus all the juicy smutt. ;-)
B008NNNF7G|5.0|From the lyrics to the musicianship  top to bottom this is one of the greatest albums Ive heard in years. Its one of the very few albums out in which the lyrics actually show true depth and life experience. The music is written with soul and passion behind it. Its one of those albums that will be a go to album in your collection for years after you buy it. Definately a must have.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Very well written.  Good story, excellent character development.  Grisham is superb at keeping a reader's interest from start to finish.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great time killer. Love the score and good graphics. Makes you think without making you feeling frustrated. The hint feature is well done.
B003A914F8|5.0|The best American band too few people heard, heard of & saw live. See them before you can't! This album sets the groundfloor for one of the most inventive rock trios ever, when you take everything into account. From here, they waxed & waned producing some greater albums & some lesser, but they always gave a great live show & each album came with some great songs. This album contains, arguably, the most consistent excellence of any of their albums I've heard (I need to catch up on a few, admittedly--just been away from new music for a while) & remains, probably, my favorite!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am not much of a reader but i could not put this book down. I was so glad I bought the trilogy on my ipad :) because I think I would have gotten up in the middle of the night to look for the second and third book.Great book ;)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three within 5 days<br />Great love story<br />We all could use a Christian for awhile in our lives :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously love this book. I really loved the cliffhanger ending... this book jumped right into the action this time instead of having to set up poverty levels in  the districts...
B005LAII0S|5.0|This movie surpass all expectations. I was skeptical until my family ask me to watch it with them. I found it to funny, amusing and entertaining. Julie Roberts did a great performance. I would recommend this film as a family friendly movie to anyone. I am so glad I bought this for my family.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This is a excellently  written book, a true original. there is very little character building but the human race becomes the main character. This book kept me eagerly turning pages all the way through. This is a great read and the style of story telling is fresh with a new twist on the Zombie genre. Read it you wont be sorry.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Wonderful movie which explores piecing a family back together after heartbreak and  tragedy.  Love, love, love George Clooney's portrayal of a dad!
B0013F1D02|5.0|Stardust is a great film! Because it is based on a Neil Gaimon book, it has just the right amounts of quirk, adventure, humor, and romance. It is a great and classic example of High Fantasy done well (and without borrowing ideas heavily from<br />Tolkein, like most fantasies do.)<br /><br />Great story, great cast, great soundtrack! Definitely a must see.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest so I was so happy to finally have an app on my Fire for it. I never had an issue logging in. In fact I've had no issues at all. You can't do every little thing that you can on an actual PC but you can do enough to make getting it worthwhile. Love it! It would be awesome if there where a way to pin from websites on the Fire though :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|As in most cases, the book is still better than the movie, but director Gary Ross has done a marvelous job adapting the story of a future, dystopian society in which the government punishes its people's past rebelliousness by forcing their children to fight each other to the death. Katniss Everdeen is the intense, intelligent, and capable heroine. She's a legitimate BAMF, complete with archery skills and a no-nonsense attitude. The villains of the story, President Snow and the other people of the Capitol, are spectacularly creepy, and you get the uncomfortable sensation that their crushingly brutal government isn't as far-fetched from reality as we'd like to imagine. A must-watch for those who appreciate strong heroines and who recognize the symbolism of a repressive government.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The \\"darker shades\\" book was actually boring.  I liked the erotica scenes but beyond that the storyline was flat.  We all want to know about Christians past and what he is hiding  from Ana.  I could have gone from the 1st to the 3rd book and not missed anything relevant to Christians past or the plot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had no previous information about the book.  Surprised yet drawn to read further.  Shocked that Ana was still a virgin.  Can a man really change from that past?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so pleased with the U Bible and find it easy to use. Great for quick look-ups while preparing my Sunday School lesson or devotionals, or for simply reading and Bible study. I was looking for an application with different versions to be able to utilize the different versions available without having to use several different Bibles. Such a time and space saver.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well maybe a man can change after his past!  Can two people really do it that many times?  S&M is a little hard to believe.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched this movie many, many times since I bought it--amazing, thoughtful stuff regarding making hard decisions in the most brutal of circumstances (and yes, we humans are capable of everything as it was depicted...and more...we've \\"been here\\" before in our history). I highly recommend this movie for everyone, but especially for families to watch together with group discussion afterwards...let your kids lead off on this one, parents--this one is dedicated to them (and their choices in life) and the parts we \\"adults\\" play, for good or ill. And let Hope NEVER be \\"contained.\\"
B000V698WE|5.0|This music will stay with you your entire life to render your life a theme, happy music.  Coltrane's life work.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|What's not to love?<br />I was hooked with the first episode of this series and hope it keeps going for at least a couple more years.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|If you are interested in learning new ways to practice s&m or sexual toys you will like the books.  There could be a very good storyline to these books but while it develops enough to make you want to finish the books, never truly takes off.  The sex scenes truly get boring and something to quickly skim through.  Great series for learning positions, marginal for storyline and character development.
B006LSZECO|5.0|haven't finished the book yet but it's great, if I wake up in the middle of the night, I start to read it instead of going back to sleep.
B008602KQI|3.0|Movie was slow like the book and I nodded off a few times.  I wish I had watched before buying
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|As a avid Heeath Ledger and Matt damon fan, I totally enjoyed this movie. The effects were also good. Worth watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put down any of them.  They are a great, quick read.  I had no interest in the movie until I read them and now am looking forward to the second movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By far the best book in the trilogy. All three books were very good but this one just had that extra spark.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I highly recommend. to anyone who has read book one of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series that they complete the trilogy.<br />Book three explores another level of their relationship, and should not be missed.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The whole series can be lumped up into the one word....garbage. It is a train wreck that you cannot look away from. The writing is so painful it is as if a school aged child wrote it. The word \\"cock\\" is used dozens of times, but only in the context of \\"she cocked her head\\". The whole thing just feels so contrived and on top of it the story is unbelievable. The story between Anna and Christian is about as believable as the girl next door who works down at the laundry mat, marrying Brad Pitt. Half the time I spent reading the book(s) i was rolling my eyes and laughing at the utter garbage going on.<br /><br />Just no - skip this one. Because for me, once I start a series, regardless of it being good or bad I must finish it because I always figure it will get better. In this case, it just gets worse.<br /><br />The kink and sex factor is about PG rated. There is very little in it that shocks and surprises you.<br /><br />On top of it all, we have women thinking this is a healthy relationship, which it is NOT. The lead male in the book is abusive and controlling. I do not mean in the sense of their sex, but genreally. Anna walks on egg shells around him not to get him upset...real healthy girls.
B008M36EEI|4.0|I came across this title while watching trailers on another movie DVD. The story sounded interesting. I was not disappointed. No action, no violence. Just a good story.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Book two of this series is full of intrigue and surprises.  No character<br />is safe from elimination which makes for a suspenseful, unpredictable story.
B008602KQI|5.0|Overall, \\"The Hunger Games\\" was a really great movie! Jennifer Lawerence was outstanding and is a rising star for sure.<br />I read the book before I saw the movie and for the most part the movie did a really great job of following the book.  Watch this movie. You will like it.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Reacher continues to intrigue, \\"do what is right\\" and entertain in the process.  Lee Child did a good recovery and repair job regarding Reacher's beliefs and values given Reacher No. 11: Bad Luck and Trouble.  I had taken about a year off of Reacher after reading No.11.  I am now back on the journey with Reacher having purchased and read No. 13 and 14 - Gone Tomorrow and 61 Hours.
0151907374|5.0|I bought this book for my partner, who was always referring to it. He couldn't find his book and thought he lost it when he moved 11 years go. I was on Amazon, saw this book, and thought  it would be a nice surprise. When given the book, he was flabbergasted, saying \\"You found it! You found it!\\"  Seems it was the exact same version  he had purchased years ago, by the same publishing company.... go figure!<br />Thanks to Amazon again, for having just what I need.
B000QFQE4U|4.0|It is by nature unmercifully condensed.  Several events and characters are combined into one instance.  It is quite moving, however, gaining traction as the film wears on. Good reenactment of the actual Audubon Ballroom assassination, based upon multiple sources.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love the television series and the books are just as great.  The vivid descriptions puts everything into perspective.  I am enjoying reading the books and putting a face to the characters.  As in the TV series, Arya is my favorite character.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Season was great..actions as always and I trully just love to watch and hear what DEX has to say.  I cant wait till next season.
B00138KCU6|5.0|Bruce and the E Streeters are marvelous.  Each song is a winner.  Just love this album.  Lots of finger-snapping.  Just a joy.  Get it!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was SO hot you needed kitchen hot pads to hold it while you read.  No seriously, I enjoyed the book.  It seemed to be a bit repetitive in the plot, he pursued, she surrendered in various types of sex.  Very little story, but a good read before you go to bed with your husband.  You can use your imagination here.  I'm in the process of reading the final book of the trilogy, but having a hard time staying with it because it's just more of the same.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Fascinating read. I have been sharing the stories and examples with others and recommending this book.  I even wrote an editorial for our local paper.<br />It seems once you decide it is OK to cheat the first time, it is easier to convince yourself to cheat more and more.<br />This book ties right in with the recent episode of cheating at Harvard.<br />It caused me to stop and ponder, \\"What would I do?\\"  Of course telling myself I would never cheat, but they made it so easy.....
B008ASLNN2|3.0|We enjoyed this movie, but it did not make a lasting impression.  When it shows up on cable we might watch it again if there is nothing more compelling on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. However, without giving the ending away for those who haven't read it, suffice it to say that I really would have preferred a different ending.<br /><br />I liked Gillian Flynn's writing style, and how she used alternating chapters to tell the stories in both character's voices, and in two different time frames until the middle of the book.<br /><br />If you like mystery/suspense novels and enjoy following the trail of clues as they unfold, this one has some great twists and turns. I'm not a medical or forensics expert, but Ms. Flynn really seemed to take her time researching her story that weaves a web of evidentiary manipulation by a brilliant sociopath. Bottom line, it's a page turner that may leave you asking yourself whether justice was served.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I was a little hesitant to rent this because it didn't seem to do so well in theaters, but I was very suprised. The cinematography is spectacular - definately watch this in HD. And the plot line was interesting and proceeded with a good pace.  I thought the actors were very believable as well.  Five stars!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story kept me riveted and coming back every chance I got.  Interesting twists and turns made me root for each of the characters at different times.  But then the ending!  I was left feeling very frustrated, unsatisfied and somehow cheated.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first one but still a good read.  The characters are still interesting and it still is a page turner.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|I like anything with one of the Wahlbergs in it.  I never miss a movie with Mark.  He is always good and his movies always keep me interested and entertained.  This was no different.  Fast paced with lots of twists and turns, this movie held my attention from start to finish.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to admit that this book had me interested from the get go. It was very good until the ending. The ending of the book ruined the whole book.
B003Z0D4SM|3.0|It took me a while to get into the story line.  But when I did it was worth the wait.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|The best three-man band ever, remastered and mixed. The 12-inch Velcro Fly kicks serious a$$!<br />Too bad nothing from Antenna made the grade, still a great album.<br /><br />MUY BUENO!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw the movie twice in the theater and then bought 2 dvds for myself and my granddaughter.  The movie was great, very suspenseful. We really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to the next one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Having never read anything by Gillian Flynn before, I was anxious to get started with \\"Gone Girl.\\"  My expectations were met and exceeded!  Her writing style kept me entertained the entire time.  The twists, turns, and characters were key to the success of this story. The ending was not what I pictured at all but I would still recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie was just as entertaining as the first one and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys nonstop action with ample cynicism and dark humor.
B000JMKNVK|4.0|This is my fourth LeHane novel, and this one got my attention faster than the others.  All were very suspenseful, this one just set the hook faster.  I have just started my fifth LeHane novel.
B0019IB0II|5.0|As a social worker of 24 years, I have learned much about the effects of physical and psychological trauma to the brain and the devestating aftermath. As a spritual being, I am always seeking ways to bring myself and others the peace we so desperately need. Dr.Bolte-Taylors book is brain 101 and then a mind blowing simple appraoch to being able to obtain that peace at any time or any place. Her explaination of the energy we bring to each other is so simple and yet so powerful. I have read it twice now and have recommened it to countless friends and peers in my profession.
B008602KQI|4.0|La calidad del video es impresionante y los extras valen la pena. En general una muy buena compra... Esperando que salgan las otras películas.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think I got more than I bargained for. I just wanted to get some personal tidbits about Tom Cruise life, throughout his amazing career. I have always been impressed with his passionate acting, his good looks, and that wonderful smile. I certainly got that, and so much more. His involvement in Scientology is an eye opener, indeed, but considering that this Biography is unauthorized, I did try to sort out what may be truth, and what may be conjecture. All of it was very interesting, and certainly worth the read.<br /><br />So happy that Amazon gives me the opportunity to choose this endless variety of good reading material.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Despite the multitude of characters, and trying to sort everyone out, this book is one that draws you in and compels you to keep reading.  I had to download the next one immediately.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I not only love this book but I also loved Book 1 & 2. I wish the author would continue the story line but what else can be said about ANA & CHRISTIAN.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In a world where sequels tend to be less than the original, I enjoyed this one even better than the first. It is well worth the purchase.
B00136NVH4|3.0|I really didn't listen too well to the samples before I downloaded the album.  I thought I remembered the albmu as being really pretty kick ass, but I was wrong.  Basically the best parts of the album are the hits we all know.  I found much of the rest of the album to be kind of boring by comparison.....Maybe it will grow on me, but I'm not too sure it will....
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|Movie was really weak.There wasn't much substance. I found myself bored at times.<br />The movie is not worth the time to watch it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is such a great way to relax after a frustrating day. The music is extremely soothing, and it always makes my day.
B002PA8Q1S|1.0|Don't bother watching this horrible movie. The plot (if that is what you could call it) is really bad. The movie stinks.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Was an extreme waste of time, had trouble staying interested.  No real story line, if you want to read about food, wine and shopping, this is a great read!<br />The first book was the most interesting and hooked you into buying the next two.  The author should have just stopped at the first book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so twisted!!!  I loved it.  I want to find more like it.  I told my friends that this book is a must read. To run out and get it.  The only thing I didn't like about  it was the cussing.  It was too much.  The ending could've been better.
B001NI24OI|4.0|Texans love football, high school, college and the professional levels. Friday Night Lights is a tale about a coach a star high school athlete and his teammates and his family. The movie is alos a tale about growing up in america with a focus on Texas, the ups and downs that are experienced in life and growing up. The movie show how the luxuries in life can cause heartache and pain.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book.  Very well written...lots of sleepy days as I could not put it down at night!!!  Highly recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is well written, the characters are well developed and the story well told. I learnt so much about flowers and feel that this is a book that you want to own.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Acoustic and electric guitars; blues rock and country-tinged tunes; ballads and never-ending jams: Could an album possibly be more eclectic!?  That's the case with 1971's Eat A Peach.  It truly represents every aspect that made the ABB the force they were.  Impeccable musicianship, stunning covers of their blues heroes, and peerless original material abound throughout the record.<br /><br />\\"Ain't Wasting Time No More\\" is a bittersweet lament with gorgeous slide guitar, compliments of Dickey Betts.  \\"Melissa\\", one of the band's now classic tunes, is the perfect marriage of acoustic and electric guitars.  \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Trouble No More\\" show the band flexing their blues muscles.  \\"Stand Back\\" and \\"Blue Sky\\" are outstanding originals that demonstrate the high level of songwriting the band was at during this point.  And the lovely coda, \\"Little Martha\\", is breathtaking; melodically and harmonically, it is truly a sophisticated composition in the vein of acoustic players like Michael Hedges and Leo Kottke, the latter of whom would actually cover the song twenty or so years later.<br /><br />The bonus disc is a concert from July of 1971.  What needs to be said about this?!  The band is at its peak.  Duane is alive and well and playing with fire and grit and spirit.  A fine companion piece to the original album.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I'm really happy to see this on the Kindle Fire! It's a very addicting game with a lot of ways to up yourself (literally). A good game to have on any device!
B000002G8N|4.0|This album finds Eric Clapton in comfortable and somewhat familiar territory; he's exploring his blues roots with cuts like the languid \\"Floating Bridge\\" and the up-tempo Muddy Waters shuffle \\"Blow Wind Blow\\", while continuing to hone his own abilities as a songwriter.  The former he does almost effortlessly, while the latter is a bit more labored.  It's true that the opening tune, \\"Something Special\\" is pleasant enough, and \\"I Can't Stand It\\", the album's only hit, is solid, but the rest of the originals, possibly save \\"Hear Me Lord\\", are weak at best.  \\"Another Ticket\\" (the song, not the album), suffers from dated strings that sound out of place and maudlin.  And the last two tracks, both originals, are generic and devoid of anything interesting.  One of the album's highlights, however, is a wonderful cover of a tune called \\"Black Rose.\\"  On this song, lovely acoustic and electric guitars wed to form one of the best tunes on the disc.  Not Clapton's best, but a decent enough effort.
B008602KQI|4.0|First time I saw it I was upset about all the things missing from the book. But now I love it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After hearing all of the comments from those who had read the series, or at least the first book 50 Shades of Grey, I was pleasantly surprised to discover the hidden jewel of this trilogy; it's actually a very intense love story. The depths that the author goes through to unveil the 50 Shades of F***ed Up\\" is amazing! I found myself crying far more oftan than I had been left breathless by the \\"kinky f***ery.\\" I couldn't put this series down, I read all three books within four weeks, and am seriously hoping that the teaser at the end of the third will result in a new novel from Christian's POV. Definitely worth the read!!
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I finally got around to reading this classic tale of migrant workers during the Great Depression and I am so glad I made the effort. Lots of history here and a good explanation of the rise of the collective labor movement. I did study some of this in my school days and I would have enjoyed having the benefit of reading this relevant work back then. Steinbeck's portrait of the Joad family brings all of this much closer to home and some of the stories (most notably the chapter describing the roadside diner)are really terrific. It is not a quick read but it does stay with you. A great investment of your time to better understand major issues still confronting our country today.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I'd recommend you read the book - actually, all three of them - before you watch this movie because of the necessity for the screenwriters to condense the story for film.  The books go into so much more detail that you're able to mentally fill in the gaps when you watch the movie, gaps you wouldn't even know were there without having first read the book.  Still, the movie is very well done, and I believe anyone would enjoy it either way.<br /><br />A word of caution, the books and this movie are a little dark, and the premise of the story, that is the hunger games themselves, is almost shocking in its brutality, especially for a series of books intended for younger readers.  After all, the games are about 24 young people placed into a computer-generated and -manipulated, but very real, environment in which their mission is to kill all the other contestants before they themselves are killed, the last person standing being the winner.  A little macabre, especially when it all takes place in a gray, hostile, post-apocalyptic world.  Having said all that, the movie is still a great one with well-developed characters (not as well as in the books), it's reasonably true to the book, and I highly recommend it.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I have read this classic several tmes during my life.  I own hardback and paperback copies of it.  The book was published in 1943 and I first read it a few years later,  probably when I was 12 or 13. I became so engrossed in the story I once sat on our very small porch rooftop to be like Francie, who read on a fire escape she could reach from her apartment window.  The story of young Francie, a voracious reader, who lives in Brooklyn with her poor family - an alcoholic father, an always-exahusted hard-working mother - is one of the best books any woman, young or old, can ever read.  When I discovered it was available now on Kindle, of course I bought it. I'm now 76 and can't wait to share Francie's life once more.<br /><br />This is not a child's book. It is about a child who makes her way in a difficult world and neighborhood,  with help from unlikely caring people along the way.<br /><br />Thank you to Betty Smith, the author, and to Kindle for making it easily available to thousands of us.<br /><br />Janice Kirkland, Salem, Oregon
B002PYW26O|5.0|Great movie! It's one of those movie you can watch over and over and it's just as good every time
B008JAG9BW|4.0|Say what you want, but the American Pie series has been a fun ride.  Okay, some of the gags are starting to get old/recycled, but let's face it... you've got to love Jim's next door neighbor growing up to be a hottie and setting her sites on her former babysitter!  You've got to love Stiffler's Mom and Jim's Dad.  And there's just something familiar about this crew that continues to entice.
B003O86FMW|1.0|The first book was very good but the second and third book s were very boring. should have stopped with just the first.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so addicted to this! I love it! I recommend this to anyone!... I have gotten so many wonderful ideas from this site.
1451673442|3.0|I think it is a good idea to practice grateful living..and there are some interesting ideas in the book..but it also seems like just writing things down and saying thanks ahead of time will make things all better..by Magic!!! Not very realistic...nice idea though.
B00330UFQS|5.0|I am finding more and more \\"new country\\" to add to my collection, and the songs/ and lyrics of Lady Antebellum fits nicely.  A solid album for all to own.
0385737947|3.0|I had seen this book mentioned many times by my friends who love young adult books. I decided to pick it up and see what they were talking about.<br /><br />Thomas finds himself in a box and being lifted up in the box. When the doors are opened, there is a large group of boys looking in on him. Thomas doesn't remember anything of his past and he has no idea what is going on in the place in which he was delivered. He starts trying to ask questions and no one has a straight answer for him. Things are strange in this new world and before he knows it, things get even stranger when the first girl is brought into their world. Things continue to spiral out of control once she arrives and all of them have to figure out how to survive.<br /><br />I found the beginning of this book a little slow and annoying. Thomas is constantly asking what is going on and the answers are vague or not given at all. I found myself as frustrated as Thomas with the lack of answers and how he was being treated by the other boys.<br /><br />As the story continues, I found myself less irritated. I became anxious about how they would get through and survive the Maze. After about half way through the book, I couldn't put it down. I was so impressed with how Thomas fought through all the questions and persevered.<br /><br />I felt like this book was different from many of the other young adult books I have read lately. It felt like it wasn't a \\"copy\\" of an idea from someone else. There could be other books out like it but I have not encountered any of them to date. I thought that the author was inventive and left you wanting more at the end of the book. I look forward to picking up the next book.<br /><br />(Library Book read Aug 2012)
B005LAIGWS|2.0|The first was way better than the second!<br />Ghost Rider looked nothing like the first.Nicholas Cage acting in the first was great,but the second was a disaster..<br />Even the special effect sucked<br />..
B000N2HBSO|3.0|This book is well researched, very thorough, but for anyone with a passable amount of American History knowledge rather redundant, and long. It isn't as bad as it looks because it has tons of citations and notes at the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All 3 of the trilogy are page turners - can not be laid down .  The Hero would be a perfect role model for young ladies or those with low self esteem.  She shows complete control in the 1st 2 books but disappointed  in the last book - she settled!
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is nothing but a cheap imitation of 50 Shades of Grey.  I hope E. L. James sues for plagiarism!  The plot line is virtually identical......down to the same dialogue in certain chapters.  The only difference is that 50 Shades takes place in Seattle, WA and Bared takes place in NYC.  Oh, and 50 Shades is well written.  Very disappointing.  Save your money.
B000FC10MU|4.0|What an imagination the author must have. Loved every minute of this. Thought provoking adventure set on awild road trip thrum little known usa
1401201911|5.0|This is the best superman graphic novel I have ever read, it's quite interesting to see what would happen if superman was raised in Russia, a must read for any superhero fan.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie! Extraordinary performances by josh hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence! I recommend this movie to everyone! It is great!
1401216676|5.0|I bought this because it's a classic, I like the alternate story of the joker's origin. I like the fact that the joker and batman are shown as equal counterparts.
B0013F1D02|5.0|A fun romantic tale. An entertaining story full of adventure and magic. A beautifully told story of young love and old witches.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|Love this album, but I really like pink. I would recommend this and any of her stuff to anyone, I have already.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've read all the books to this series of movies before it came out. The movie was very authentic to the books except for just some small places. I saw it in a theater and just want to collect the whole set now.
B0035XVVDY|2.0|This movie starts great and has a very exciting story line and keeps you excited until the end but the ending is poorly written and directed. I already thought of couple of endings that would make the movie more exciting and suiting the story line.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|An excellent deal, quite a bargain really. If you are into the series but don't own the books yet, this is a good start.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|came brand new in the box just as advertised. Took a while to get but worth it. I cannot wait to have a weekend to myself to watch them
B0015F1VY8|4.0|Beautiful images in this film. All performaces were well done and the plot was interesting enough. Worth the time, and a good follow up to the first film \\"Elizabeth\\".
B008602KQI|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS MOVIE CAN BE ENJOYED BY ALL AGES AND I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE SECOND MOVIE.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults alike.  The animation is excellent and to view it in 3D on a 60\\" screen is breathtaking.  There aren't that many 3D movies to chose from and most are animations, so if you're looking for some good material to tryout that new 3D big screen HDTV you won't be disappointed with \\"Ledgend of the Guardians\\"!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|For those looking for fantacy reading that you can put down almost as fast a you pick it up, this is your book.  If you have been there, this is all verynice pulp for those poor ladies that dream themselves as a a princes, but lack the credentials.<br />A waste of the cost of the book...
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I really wasnt sure if the series was something I wanted to read, but most of my friends were chattering about it, so I took the bait. I was angered by Ana's lack of self-esteem, and Christian's violent tendancies - the whole power and control, punishment and reward system - like Ana allowed herself the be Pavlov's dog. The so-called vanilla sexual encounters were titillating at first, but clouded the story line, and became boring. I don't recommend the 50 series to anyone but possibly bored housewives.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy to use from my Android phone.  Can even set up daily prints through HP apps. Highly recommend this for anyone with an HP wireless printer.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great work by Gary Ross of adapting the movie from the book, and great extra content like the famous letter sent by Donald Sutherland about his character and how I can be portrayed, thumbs up!
B0088RQ4TI|2.0|I rented this - High Definition - movie assuming that high definition was what I would get.  Unfortunately the definition of high definition that Amazon uses and the one I use are two very different things.  The one they use seems to be 720p as opposed to the 1080i the rest of the world uses.  Although I certainly enjoyed the movie (squinting aside), it will be the last time I rent an HD movie from Amazon.  Just glad I didn't buy it.  What a disappointment that would have been.  If you have access to Comcast HD movies on demand you might want to use it.  Even though it is a dollor or so more expensive, you get what you pay for...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I didn't think I'd be buying Book 2, but once you start reading and get past the \\"kinky stuff\\", the story line is great.  It is a well-written, sadistic, funny, romantic love story.  Can't wait to finish the series.  Hope the heroine can totally convert her man.  It's really a turn on and can't wait to the the movie version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Like it's two predecessors, the book is entertaining, and its characters are engaging and believable.  Comparing it to other authors, I would say it's George Orwell crossed with James Patterson.  The book is well plotted and resolves the central conflict of all three books in a believable way.  I'm 75 and enjoyed the books as much as my 13-year-old grandson who urged me to read them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From page one GONE GIRL draws the reader in and  does not  let go til the surprising end.  This book was finished in  record time because I couldn't stop reading  til late at night.  Highly recommended!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't like the end but, that was because there was no more of the engrossing story left for me to read.
B007SGM084|3.0|I am reading this trilogy because of the general conversations about it.  I did not know what to expect and am disappointed that this type of book gets so much interest.  I have just about finished the second book.  There have been so many people saying that the third book is the most important to tie all this together so I am sure I will finish it if for only that reason.  Otherwise I might not finish them.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Once again, Michael Connelly does it.  I haven't read all of his books and am working through them, but it is one of the more intelligent portrayals of the personal problems faced by many police in big cities.
B008602KQI|5.0|Just remember, the movie is never as good as the book but this film comes very close! Some important things are left out but the actors were chosen to perfection and the scenes are perfect.
B006LSZECO|2.0|II was disappointed in this book  I thought it was an interesting read but too long and drawn out.  I also did not like the ending, and I think it left too many unanswered questions based on Nick's character analysis.  Rememberhe was going to have a child with a psychopath.  The resolution and ending really left me cold.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|this game has good graphics, good music, and fun game play. it is not really difficult, but complex enough to keep you engaged. the crowd-sourced social gaming feature also keeps the game interesting after you solved the initial levels.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love this album so much. Her voice is so dynamic and soothing, it's an easy album to relax to. I love every song. Yep.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app works great.  Repinning is easy and the viewing is great too.  Looking forward to more pinning. love it!
B002P3J3BW|5.0|May have been budget-priced originally, but not right now. I'm not paying $5000 for a used set. This needs to be re-issued. A lot of us missed the boat on the original complete Rubinstein set but that was re-packaged and brought back out again last year. Horowitz' turn, now.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I received this item on time and in excellent condition and I must say it has become my choice for exercise!...Yes, not only is it a great movie, but it also creates an atmosphere for dancing along with the show.  Try it!
B0016CS0IK|3.0|M83 is one of those acts I was aware of, but hadn't quite got around to listening to. Bought Saturdays = Youth on sale based on the strength of Hurry Up, We're Dreaming (which I'd picked up months ago.) Well worth the time to explore their back catalog.
B008K3HRF0|1.0|While the original story has an ecological theme. This movie takes it to a whole different level. From a back-handed slight to believers in God, to demonizing all corporations and thematically denouncing entrepreneurs and profits. Such as the idea that the president of a corporation is intentionally polluting the air so his company can make a profit by selling people clean bottled air. Finally the city walls are destroyed presumably so that the \\"healing\\" can begin. I always liked the story of The Lorax.  This just felt like a propaganda film by some Earth-First organization. I just wish I hadn't bought the electronic version so I could at least throw it in the trash.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|In a dance of dragons things start to finally come together.I have gone back and started A Game of Thrones and<br />am amazed at how all the threads  of the stories are finally connected in dance.Not that there are not some new surprizes and questions which I am anixiously waiting to find out how they turn out but in dance you see aal that has happened began in book 1  or before the battle of the trident-the sack of kings landing the targaryens(Rhagar)the starks(lyanna) and all the other houses great and small all that happens comes from these pre book 1 themes  through out all books and clarified and connected in Dance and  it is well wort while to read the appendix of each book
B008ASLK8A|5.0|You will laugh cry and feel right beside Sherlock threw this movie! Very great plot. Usually a sequels to great movies turn out bad but I can't wait to see the third one
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was exciting & I couldn't anticipate what was going to happen next! This is the best book I have read in awhile!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books then buy the movie. They are great wonderful and the best book to movie transfer I've seen

B007R12TNQ|5.0|My Granddaughter enjoys the use of my Kindle Fire when she is visiting.<br />One afternoon she was bored and discovered that my Kindle can play videos.<br />She asked if I could \\"borrow\\" Alvin and the Chipmonks, Chipwrecked, I purchased<br />it and my granddaughter watched it and absolutely loved this movie!<br />Now that she knows I can get movies on my Kindle Fire, she's been asking to see more!<br />Thanks Amazon, your prices and selections are the best!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it is funnmy family likes it zoology i should give it a 4 but I don't find it addicting at all so if you like games where _you shoot things ( birds in this case)  to knock things ( pigs)  down then I'm fine with u getting it
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Well, the book certainly won't win any literary awards, but I guess that's not why millions of women (and a few men) are reading it. It is entertaining but I found some of the x-rated scenes started to get repetitive and the plot was generally predictable. I never read the Twilight series that it was loosely based on, but I could still figure it out. Even with the stilted dialogue and overused adjectives, it was fun to read. And yes, I also read the third book in the series. Perfect light reading when you don't want to think too hard.
B008XG1X18|5.0|PINTEREST app is  very easy and fun to use. There are so many categories to search from. You can find tips from marriage to tips on saving money. Its like having a giant everlasting wish list!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Just picked this game up as the Free App of the Day.  Quell Reflect is a relaxing puzzle game.  The music alone is like it's alone relaxation CD.  Good change of pace from Angry Birds. I had the original Quell game from a previous FAotD promotion, so this was a pleasant surprise.  This plays great on Android phones or tablets.  I definitely recommend Quell Reflect.<br /><br />However, I want to point out to anyone using a Android phone that this app is Wifi download only.  So you can't download it on your phone unless you connect to Wifi either at home or at free Wifi spot.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Man, something happened to George's editors between this book and the last. As much as I enjoy the rich detail and depth of character in this series I found that I had to power through large sections of this book, hoping that it would get better. A great deal of time was spent attempting to develop characters that just weren't very interesting. After reading interminable chapters of Sansa/Alayne I still don't care about her.<br />  This book wasn't bad, it was just too damn long. It was also a terrible disappointment coming on the heels of book 3 which was excellent. It would have benefited from some aggressive editing, and books 4 and 5 should have remained a single volume.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story is both heart breaking and<br />heart warming. It is adorably told from the dog's perspective. Dog lovers will<br />love it!
B008602KQI|4.0|When I heard the the movie was rated PG-13 I was thinking the books have to be  better. Graet movie I have watched it three times already, and is going down in my top ten movies list. Just one of those movies you can watch over and over again. I am reading the books of the Huger Games over again...
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was a good book with many funny parts. Probably because I can relate to her bad luck and poor timing. <3
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Good game that is addictive.  I really enjoy playing this game.  Thank you for making it available for the Kindle Fire.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is such a smart descriptive writer. I love all of her novels. Although rather dark, Sharp Objects was a great read. Would definitely recommend.
B0085W6IUQ|3.0|It's a good album.Steve Hackett and Chris Squire are the most respected prog-rock artist I know.Steve Hackett seems to dominate this effort.At times some tunes remind me of GTR(a Hackett and Steve Howe collaboration effort). I wished Chris Squire would have been more pronounced in this effort.He has got pretty good vocals which I didn't hear much of.All in all, it's a good album.It's a really good album for prog-rock fans.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|this movie was not good at all it was hard to follow and just very very slow. I did watch the entire movie although it was very hard and still did not find it enjoyable
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album is a little bit of everything, great sounds can't wait for next one. Carry on should be next single!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I have not read this book or the others in the series, however I was immediately drawn into the story.  I look forward to movies made from the sequels.
B008602KQI|5.0|Had no knowledge of The Hunger Games prior to viewing it.  It is a surprisingly relevant metaphor to some of the politics seen lately.  Looking forward to the sequels.
B0064W65SO|5.0|Had this story been adapted to the first Nolan Batman movie, it would've been just as good. The best part of the book is the way it treats the characters and world as a believable place/people.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie. Next one will be even better can't wait the books are awesome great job with adaptation to the big screen the movie was family friendly withgeeat meaningful spofs
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Beautifully written in every sense. This is a truly spectacular book that you can't put down! I can't wait for Walking Disaster.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book gets 1 star and only because I was morbidly fascinated to read the whole thing and find out what happened. Usually, when a book sucks, I drop it. So here's your one star from me. Congratulations on making it to the New York Times Bestsellers list with this book. I'm usually a lot more forgiving when it comes to reviews, but when a book suggests coercing a virgin into having painful hard-core sex is sexy and hot, I'm out. Christian's only values was being a young rich guy who was handsome. Umm, that doesn't make it ok for him to chase after Ana like some stalker psycho.    Here's part 1 of my review on my website: [...]    Since everyone and their mom already bought this book, and since I'm an author who's striving for success, I bought 50 Shades of Grey for (mostly) research purposes. Yes, my interest was piqued about the BDSM content as well--I'm not such a prude that I don't enjoy the occasional erotic novel--but I wanted to see why it's so popular and why it made it to the New York Times Bestselling list. As an author, it's my duty to figure this stuff out so I might be able to get there one day. So, against the advice of my writer friends, I went out and bought myself a hard copy.    I'm halfway through and...    *sigh*    I think this might read better in list format. Here's what I found so far:    ~SPOILER ALERT~    POSITIVES    The writing isn't that bad--Contrary to popular belief, E.L. James has quite the vocabulary. Yes, there were a lot of words/phrases echoed where I wish I could've advised against using, \\"Oh, my; I bit my lip/biting the lips; Oh, crap; and groaned\\" so many damn times. I've read worse dialogue, so it is what it is.    The voice is loud--To my non-writer friends, voice in a book happens when the characters practically dance off the page. Anastasia has a personality separate from Kate and Christian. I feel for her; I know her. She's become a friend of mine. Yes, I've had ignorant and naive friends like this before.    Descriptionis not lacking--I didn't get confused about where Ana was, whose house she was in, or what she was feeling. There was a somewhat good use of descriptive words.    NEGATIVES    I hate Christian Grey--He's a vindictive, controlling bastard with commitment issues. He takes the innocence of Ana without a backwards glance. He doesn't even stop to think what he might be psychologically doing to her by introducing her to all these things when she's so damn inexperienced. BDSM is not something to be taken lightly. It's takes years of experience, knowledge, and understanding to fully get into it. Both parties need to want to to it from the beginning, not be coerced into doing it.    Anastasia and Christian are the perfect example of an abusive relationship--I get why E.L. James had Christian draw up the BDSM contract for Ana to sign, but it didn't sit right with me. She couldn't talk about her predicament with anyone but Christian, putting him in total control, and not allowing her to see both sides to the story. Christian wants her to do all these kinky sexual fantasies with him, pressuring her when it doesn't sit right with her. She was a virgin for Pete's sake. This was her first glimpse in a world far too advanced for her skill level.    He's practically raping her--Even if it's \\"consensual\\" (and I use that word lightly because Christian keeps pressuring her by telling her how much he wants her; how much he's attracted to her), I saw Ana being raped every time they had sex. On their first time together, he slams himself into her. Ummm dude, she's an efffing virgin! I wanted to slap him. Plus, Ana finds herself crying throughout the book because she wants a real relationship, and instead gets this messed-up version of sexual slavery. NO THANKS!    Part 2 of my review [...]  ~SPOILER~    Basically, the book ends where Ana asks Christian to show her his worst. He was always talking about punishing her and she wanted to see what turned him on. She wanted the whole package before committing herself, so what Christian did was he took Ana over his knee and whipped her with a belt. Yeah, that finally scared her off. She was emotionally distraught to leave him because she loves him, but she knows she can't do that sort of thing with him.    Well, it's about time she came to her senses. But that was the whole plot. Man wants woman for sex, woman is virgin but gets with him anyways, both can't see eye-to-eye about the relationship, and she leaves. Nothing big, nothing life changing. Blah blah blah I could've gotten this drama back in high school.    WHAT I LEARNED    The popular majority get off on reading about hot men who control weak-minded women. Usually, there's some form of consent, the girl is innocent, and the guy has years of experience. The girl always falls in love with the guy, but the guy tends to hold back on committing because he's got another side of him he doesn't want the girl to see.    Hello, repetitive recipe.     Honestly, I much prefer reading books about strong willed women who commit courageous acts, not ones who wait for the `perfect guy' to sweep her off her feet. But hey, if you're into that kind of thing, more power to ya.    Oh and one more thing, just because a dude is super hot, rich, and powerful does not mean his freaky weird psycho tendencies are legitimate. Crazy is as crazy does.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|hadnt much idea  what it was  about  when i read  it  was  recommended  it  by amazon  because i had  bought one day.  was  genuinely moving.  Bawled  my way through a  lot of it  - would  recommend  well worth the  read
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I'm a big fan of horror movies in general, and this is honestly probably the very best horror movie I've ever seen. The acting is superb, the scares are very well done, and the story sets this movie apart from most in its genre by actually making sense.  The characters are realistic and don't do stupid things that nobody in their right mind would do.  And the plot is actually intriguing and stands on it own.
B005KPDAYS|2.0|I became weary of House by season 8,it was falling into a bad void..Cuddy left,and she was a major character which held the show together...the addition of Park the oriental doctor did give the show a few laughs with her sparkling personality and wit. I think the writers overdid the Vicodin..putting it in the same category as heroin and other hard drugs. The whole thing got tiresome, and it seems the actors also tiring of the show, they made the supreme effort, but could not pull it off.Hugh Laurie has gone on to the music industry with his band, I wish him luck.
B00846REIS|3.0|This 50 Shades knock off is just that; only the characters aren't as interesting, the many many sex scenes aren't as interesting, the story line... wait, is there a story line?
B008S7EPXA|5.0|no, really, it is. Fans have waited 16yrs for this album, and it was well worth waiting for. In fact, this album ranks up there with their best works. I just played the MP3 today for some peeps at work, and they never heard of DCD. They loved it. If you didn't get to see them live this year, you missed out on one hell of a show. What are you waiting for, a free download of this album on some site? Buy the MP3 for $6, or get the vinyl (it comes with a download card). It's well worth your hard earned money.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I did not even enjoy reading until I began the Song of Ice and Fire series and so far a Storm of Swords is the best yet in the series.  It is an interesting and suspenseful story.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A touching and appropriate metaphor for the ups and downs of life, Joyce's novel is a nod to those who have the courage to break out of their own skins and strive for some personal happiness in this topsy-turvey world.  --Joe Peacock, MAT, MFA
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I had to cancel my credit card because my grandson did not realize he was purchasing more items for this game.
034580404X|5.0|I now understand why E L James waited so long to complete her dream!  These Fifty's were excellent.  I know the movie will be a BIG HIT....however....I hope they don't cut out the juicy parts!!!!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I understand that this is the first novel Stephen King wrote...It was published much later, but this is the first.  It's VERY different than any of his other stories.  You may be surprised (in a good or bad way) with the ending, but as King himself has said, he's just the channel through which the story flows.  This is written in such a way that it could happen today, 100 years from now, or 50 years in the past.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  I love how he tells the story in pieces, and you find out more and more about the characters' pasts as the present story progresses.  This is an extremely intense, DARK story (Bachman is an extremely intense and dark guy though).
B001GWUBSC|5.0|Enjoy this DVD set to the max. Great acting, well staged, believable look back at history. Actors were superb and the script kept your interest from start to finish. I missed it on TV and yet I am very happy I decided to buy the uncut version, I would have hated to miss any of the scenes.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Great story, very easy read.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is my first Neil Gaiman story and I plan to read all of his books.  Author has a great sense of humor, as well.  Not a fairy tale for kids, though.  It has a couple sex scenes (nothing vulgar, just \\"adult-level\\" reading).  I really loved this book and I am looking forward to reading his other works.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I expected more from this product.  It is not always on line when I look for the weather.  The graphics are only fair.  I have been having difficulty adding new cities.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|everyone should buy this movie.  this old movie  surpasses anything out thre today. its real acting andyou will watch this over and over again. this was a great price and arrived very quickly!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like the original Mario Bros but a little easier. I think my 7 yr old will really like this.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much.  The twists and turns kept me guessing until they were revealed.  I love Jack Reacher and am working my way through all of them.  This one is one of the better ones.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|This movie finally made me look at Michelle Williams and commend her on the acting she is capable of. Seeing her play Ms. Monroe was refreshing and entertaining. Finally Marilyn from A different perspective!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love it very much it has lots of challenge levels love all the characters it's a super game everyone will love it
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game! My son absolutely loves it! It's fun and enjoyable we love when he plays and talks about the monkeys
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is my favorite book of the trilogy. So many loose ends from Book One, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, are tied up and explained.
B006RUJST6|3.0|It was OK. Simply written, I found it too predictable.  It is a good airplane book because it goes fast; no need to give it a lot of thought.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I bought this product on accident actually. I wasnt taking it seriously when it said one click purchase. Anyways fruit ninja paid is pretty fun. You get extra blades and backgrounds, an online game mode option, and a new fruit to slice. Plus theres no lag at all. it was all right but i dont think it's worth a dollar. Online is literally a joke because theres always a server error. So basically all you get is a new fruit and no lagginess. If you dont care for spending a dollar, then get it. Otherwise, I reccomend leaving it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book was interesting and kept you on your toes. The ending will surprise you. I couldn't put the book down everytime I turned the page I had to read more. The characters in the book were interesting and versatile. I can't wait to get book two
0307987647|5.0|This is the second in the series. I bought this on cd's to listen to while driving to work and back. Great entertainment while the miles fly by. Sometime I even drive slower than normal, just to have more time with the story. Great buy.Great mind numbing entertainment. I will buy the next in the series on cd also.
B00846REIS|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars had I not read Fifty Shades of Grey.  It was so identical to that book that it was almost comical, but I loved Fifty Shades, and I loved this copy cat.
B007R11PX6|5.0|This was a great addition to the Chipmunk movies, A fun story line and great way of keeping things fresh.  Hope to see them keep this going.
B00159H0W6|1.0|Was not able to download the episode, an error message from Amazon kept displaying. This is the first time I tried to download something from Amazon. Will continue to use Itunes. Had to give it at least one star in order for this to be posted.
B007SGM084|5.0|I didn't know what all the hoopla was about so I thought why not read it.  Wow am I glad I did!  This series was very entertaining and it kept me interested the whole way.  Given the context I think the author did an outstanding job in keeping it tasteful.  I was sorry to see the end.  Hope to see more like this from E L James.
B008133MDK|4.0|Seldom does modern TV interest me at all; I'm very critical.  This series, however, has it all: excellent and consistent writing, skilled acting, and good production value.  The dialogue is crisp and the stories are faithful to the originals where possible and updated where necessary.  Cumberbatch presents a thoroughly believable Holmes.  Although the second season isn't quite as good as the first it still exceeds any and all other current BBC efforts and most stateside.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the movie in the theater and absolutely loved it on blu ray.  Never having read the book, I didn't know what to expect and was happy to see a great movie, far deeper and superior to the teen vampire movies.  The action and the visuals were superior on blu ray and repeat viewings are in order.
B008602KQI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]<br /><br />As the story unfolds, with it's impossible possibility you can't help but be rooting for Katniss Everdeen.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  I recommend that you read the book first. If possible read Catching Fire too, before seeing The Hunger Games.  The books can take you so much deeper into the thoughts and actions as the drama unfolds.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Unlike most movies, this one has aged really, really well. The kids (16, 13, 10, & 10)loved it too. A true classic.
B00846REIS|4.0|A fun, quick read. I read this in two days. Not as much plot as Fifty Shades but, the same idea.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a Great movie, what more can I say! I Hope they make movies of the other two books!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was good, not as good as the book of course but did a good job of visually representing the movie.  One complaint was the jerky camera shots - I'm sure they were going for a particular look but made the movie super annoying to try to watch.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|An awesome collection by Clapton!! Wonderful music beautifully done by the master.If you have one collection by Clapton, this is the one to have!
B006PKQQJS|3.0|Not what I thought it would be.  Wanted something for a child of 4.  This is not it.  Cute for anyone older if you are into these kinds of things...not for me.
B0039O8AQK|4.0|\\"It's not so much staying alive - it's staying human that matters.\\" 1984 depicts the horrors of communism/socialism so well - where the individual only has value in relation to the State. The indiviual has no intrinsic value otherwise. This is in contrast to the ideals set forth in the the Declaration of Independance here in the US where it is recognized that individuals are \\"endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights....\\"<br /><br />I gave this film 4 stars instead of 5 because so much of what especially Richard Burton had to say was lost (to me at least) because of unclear, mumbling speech. Extraoirdinary that an actor of Burton's ability was required to speak in such a maner, thus losing important words & thoughts that should be made clear for understanding what is going on for the sake of whatever the Director had in mind I suppose.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book; I could not put it down..er..close the kindle app. It yanked on my heart strings and brought tears to my eyes on several occasions. Vanessa Diffenbaugh gave her main character a brilliant voice. The usage of the flowers was so unique, as well as the story line. And, although I wasn't too thrilled with the ending, it still got the job done effectively. Overall it was a fabulous read, and I recommend it.
B0083VE37Y|5.0|This album is the best of her feel-good, shake-ya-ass dance tunes. It was my first purchase of her music (although I've since purchased more!) Worth every penny.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I didn't like the first 50 Shades book, due to the poor writing and annoying repetition (the frowning, the whispering, and the murmuring... I could go on for days).  I admit, the last two pages of book one hooked me into buying book two and I wish I hadn't.  More of the same terrible writing/repetition and on top of everything else, it's incredibly BORING just like the first one.  There is zero chance of me buying book three.<br />I'm convinced that if any of the fans of this book had ever read any other erotic romance novels at all, they would change their minds about \\"50 Shades of Implausible Stupidity\\".  I wanted to like these books, I really did, but they are virtually unreadable.  There are countless other authors in this genre; please give them a chance.  Do not waste your money on this series!
B006H8BIIM|4.0|When this was faotd I skimmed a few reviews and snagged it, but I hadn't taken the time to even try it until last week. It wasn't until after I played it for a few hours that I read more of the reviews, and because I was kind of surprised at some of them, I'm going to add my own.<br /><br />First of all, the gameplay starts out relatively simple, though some of the mechanics are not fully explained and you have to figure them out. By the fifth or sixth mission in campaign mode it gets very challenging.  As with many other games of this nature, even if you fail a mission you get partial credit so eventually with enough retries you can purchase upgrades to help you along, plus the survival modes let you gain credits as well.<br /><br />I've played about an hour of the non-campaign, survival modes. The amount of credit you get is based on the difficulty level, so surviving for 20 minutes on very easy will get you about as much as playing for 5 minutes on medium. One thing that is slightly confusing is that the campaign modes will give you some weapons you haven't unlocked for the survival modes yet. So I suggest playing the campaign modes until you hit a level you can't complete after a couple tries, paying attention to the upgrades you can actually use in that level, then do survival mode on the hardest difficulty you can stomach to build up credits to get them.<br /><br />Gameplay seems a little thin. As of the 7th or 8th level it has become apparent that possible strategies are limited; so far the simultaneous number of enemies has increased but there are no more really helpful upgrades available - it's a case of making as many weapons as you can afford and hoping you get them in the right place.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed after playing the intro mission is that it's a little odd that the default layout for the Kindle Fire (maybe other tablets) is not the HD view. But it's nice that there is a mode that takes advantage of larger screens. On the Fire a lotof the items in this view are rather smaller than I would like but I suppose it would be perfect on a 10\\" screen.<br /><br />Perhaps I haven't gotten far enough in the game to need in-app-purchases to proceed, or perhaps the developer has restructured the game a bit since some of those reviews, but it seems there is only one in-app purchase available and it gives you all upgrades at once. To me, this is more of a cheat than a necessity and its presence doesn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />I got this as FAOTD a while back but didn't try it right away. With all the competition for my attention among free and inexpensive apps it would be hard for me to say I'd choose this one if it weren't free. It is probably about half the game it would need to be for me to pay for it. I'm enjoying it... but it won't last long.
0316023744|4.0|This is an incredibly informative book which covers most aspects of combat and campaigns in WWII. While not the defining book on the war, it needs to be included in any collection. There is very little mention of the homefront in most of the countries, other than the effects of operations. That does not take away from this work.<br />HOWEVER......what is missing in huge amounts are maps.  He goes into great detail on a lot of battles and campaigns, and the reader has no idea where he is talking about. While there are some maps included, which go into some detail, these are poorly marked. One map included regarding  a campaign on the Eastern front does not have one of the key cities that he repeatedly refers to.<br />Though not important, what is also weird is that on occasion he refers to a picture taken of an incident or a meeting, and does not include it. Most photos included are not the best representative of those available. These almost seem to be an after-thought.<br />But it is the lack of maps surely detracts from the quality of this book and keeps it from being a 5 Star.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have appreciated the sensibility of the author in the development and description of the characters. It has permitted me to identify and recognize not only my longing for a relationship gifted with such intimacy but also a good model as a woman to be in essence a woman who wants to care for a man, but also a woman who remains true to herself.<br />Thank you
B00138KEZ4|5.0|My wife asked for this collection.  Sarah as a wonderful voice and the songs fit her voice well.  I need twenty words so, go check out the samples of her music. Let me know what you think. Tell me what you like or dislike.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was hands down one of the best books I've ever read for depth of a new world, character development and story line. There are parts where I wept openly, or remained agape with surprise. 10/10!
B008M34INW|5.0|Like one other review said this is the old Mel Gibson rough and tumble movie. The ending has a different tone which is refreshing. The movie has a tough guy, a villain, a heroine, suspense ,cunning and action.
B008602KQI|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times.  It reminds me of other \\"enjoyable\\" movies, Harry Potter, Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Hobbitt.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|While this was a quick read and it held my interest, the story was more a litany of new and ever more outrageous forms of torture than a tale of adventure and romance.  I hope the next volume is less macabre.  My only other remark is that the cast is so huge its hard to keep track of who's who.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are awesome and are real page turners! I am not usually into romance but I just LOVE these books. Yes they are a little raunchy and I found myself blushing a lot but they have a strong story that gets you through all the x rated stuff. My only regret is finishing them so quickly.....now I can't curl up with Christian Grey every night :(
B006LSZECO|5.0|This starts off like a chick book, but quickly becomes a page turner, with so many twists and turns, my head is still spinning.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was amazing to read and discuss with friends and co workers... I look forward to reading more written by E L James.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book is more of the same.  There is very little story line going on here that we haven't already heard.  I made it through the first book in a couple days, 2nd book in a couple of weeks and now this one is taking months.  My interest has definitely lessened on this one.  She should have stopped at two, done a little less beguiling in the 2nd and added this weak plot line to it.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This movie is a Definite watch. It has a good story and the best part is, there is no junk. Maybe one scene where she may be dressed a bit inappropriately but that is about it.<br />I loved it and would recommend seeing it
B000SEGMAU|5.0|[[ASIN:076790592X Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson]]<br /><br />I loved this book. It explains a lot about life and death. I also love the fact that someone like Morrie exists. He is a true life saver and this book should be taught in every class about life.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|I like this CD is was really nice. Demi has really matured with her music. I can be a fan of her. Some of the song I can relate too. It worth it.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|but I'll try not to play the spoiler. Suffice it to say, the full meaning of Take Shelter rests perilously upon the final scene, where the primary issue of the film--the sanity of the protagonist--is seemingly resolved. A straight-forward reading of that scene yields a richness of social implication; allegorical or ironic readings yield nothing but the fruit of a well-acted psycho-suspense thriller.<br /><br />Appearances aside, this is not a film about the private affairs of a married couple, and this is not a film that ends on a note of discontinuity. The whole point of the film is that the line between private anguish and public life is an illusion; the whole point of the ending is that it is the logical outcome of a psychological process that has been building up for two hours on screen.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Take Shelter is about the challenge of people coming together in the face of an impending political catastrophe, about forging a meeting-of-minds that requires nothing less than extraordinary courage and empathy from all of us, as we strive to overcome the all-but-unbridgeable gaps between our various subjective experiences of the world. In this sense, the super-natural elements in Take Shelter appear only superficially in the sky; the real miracle is in what happens between two human beings--married or unmarried, it makes no difference--by the end of the film.<br /><br /> In my view, Take Shelter is far and away the most important political film of this young century.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I bought this item for my sonic screwdriver collection. It is one of my favorite screwdrivers. However because the pen nubs are interchangeable they refuse to stay on and fall of when you set it down or put it in your pocket otherwise its great.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a wonderful adaptation of the book, all three of which I devoured in a week.  The story is well written and makes a viewer think.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. You will never see the ending coming!Once I started reading it was hard to put down, I had to know what came next.
B007M45PMU|5.0|These guys opened up for Old Crow Medicine Show and were so great. I enjoyed all the songs so decided to buy the album. Great album!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all three of these books.  They were hard to put down and when you finished one you had to go and buy the next one asap.  I have a Kindel and as soon as I finished a book I went and bought the next one right away. I wish there were more.  These are really good reads.  I would for sure say go get them and enjoy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very good movie and it appeals to a wide audience. It probably wont win any major Oscars but it is very entertaining and captivating much the the book it is adapted from.
B002VHI8T0|4.0|What a pleasure to read something that felt so honest and moving and was written with a mix of such passion and pain. This book made me re-think my own \\"addictions\\" even though they are a long way from James's. Is it all a matter of choice? I tend to agree with him that yes it is. We all have the power to yes or no to whatever our demons are. I would love to see schools introduce this novel in high school criteria.
B008602KQI|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that Jennifer Lawrence has easily become my favorite young actress. She's amazing in everything I've seen her in, including this. Hunger Games is emotional, insightful and visceral. I was amazed at the honesty in the violence. No strings or special effects can make you feel the way you do when you see the Games in action. I felt a connection with the characters almost from the beginning, which is rare for me, and I cared about their situations.<br /><br />I could go on but the truth of the matter is you need to see this for yourself. I dont review many movies but this one deserves it. I look forward to seeing the rest of the series and plan on reading the books as soon as I finish with my current selection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book and series!!! Read all 3 and loved them!!!  Would like to read more! Maybe book four will come out!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game but the powerups are so expensive. I spend about a few hours a week playing this game, which is pretty good for something not on a console.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Who'd have guessed that a fellow such as Harold Fry - elderly, reticent and a failure as both father and husband - could make such a compelling hero? As he journeys, by foot no less, on his purely noble quest to keep Queenie - a former workmate - from succumbing to her terminal Cancer, so long as he keeps walking to join her in Hospice, hundreds of miles from his home. Comparisons to Odysseus and his classic voyage are inevitable, as our guy connects with a multitude of characters who impact his trek on the way to attaining his goal. These meetings are almost all written with a keen observation towards the humanity in each encounter that, inevitably, helps our Harold to become a better man. This is a wonderful read.
B008K3HRF0|2.0|Great movie! Image quality was fantastic too. But i'm really disappointed that it's only a streaming movie file which means that i must have internet connection to watch it. For $14 I expected to have a completely downloaded file to my computer that i can play when or wherever i want. (for the kids on a long road trip for example)<br />I was so mad. If i knew before hand that i would not have full access to the movie then i would not have purchased $14 dollar movie that could only watch \\"sometimes\\".
B003RT0NK8|1.0|Interesting concept, but poor execution. A good Cast is wasted in what could have been a decent movie. It made we wish for my money back.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Ferguson does an excellent job exposing the banking crisis in easy terms so that everyone understands.  We are typically made to believe that these sensitive financial instruments are too complex to understand and so therefore we should go back to the celebrity gossip column and stay there.<br /><br />But no major networks are covering the crisis adequately, and our eyes our not yet open to the rapacious nature of our current banking and monetary system.<br /><br />If you can understand greed and power, you can understand the current crisis. And it is still, years after the movie was made, current.  Why?  Because no one has yet been placed in handcuffs.  All of the criminals still walk free. Instead of going into hiding, these top CEO bank robbers are smug and brazen, and still at work, devaluing currency, gambling with the money of banking customers and tax payers---the globe over.<br /><br />So even if you bought a house that you could afford during or before the housing bubble, you are still a victim of a gigantic crime.<br /><br />Why is no one in handcuffs?  The regulatory agencies and the honest people put in place to oversee banking activity have all been deliberately downsized, bribed, or intimidated.  So the out-of-control theft could happen and even accelerate.<br /><br />Ferguson does an especially honest job of exposing the problem as a bipartisan creation.  There are individuals in both major political parties to blame, as politicians helped deregulate consumer laws that were originally put in place to protect us.<br /><br />The original criminals, however, are the top echelon of the banking empire, especially the Federal Reserve, the fox who is nefariously guarding the hen house. Not only did  the criminals deregulate the laws which were originally put in place to protect us, they broke existing laws to do their evil deeds.<br /><br />And because there have been no arrests, the looting continues.  I think Inside Job is required viewing for every US Citizen. Not only has our money been stolen, but our freedoms as well.<br /><br />Wake up, America, we are being robbed!
B002JVWR4A|2.0|I love the series Bones, but I was not really happy with the DVD I received ... I relized it was a pre owned but there were quit a few glitches on the disks.... I think from now on I will buy new..
B005IQZB14|4.0|As a lifelong sloth, a person who reads about travel, reads about adventure, reads about most everything that happens outside the safety of my favorite chair, Cheryl Strayer may as well be a character in fiction. But she isn't. She is real and coming here to Florida State University in February to talk about her writing. I plan to be in attendance. Yes, she really did walk about 1500 miles. Did her toes and feet ever recover?! She writes clearly and compellingly.  She does not give up.  Read this! PW
B0055B7K7A|5.0|It took me two years to finally get around to this movie, but I'm glad I finally did. It's well done, well written, with some nice themes for both the kids and their parents. I don't do spoilers, so suffice it to say that if you're one of those grown-ups who looks down their nose at Disney/Pixar films, you'll be pleasantly surprised if you give this movie a chance. Of course it's an animated film, and of course it features some \\"unrealistic\\" scenes (although, in animation, is there really such a thing?) But, if you give this film your attention, and really watch it, you won't be disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the real deal -- compulsively readable, well-edited and priced right.  My troika of bliss.<br /><br />Buy this set.  Don't read any of the reviews.  Go in cold.  It's that good.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|I enjoyed this amazing story, and I think anyone who wants to learn about Chinese history would find it intriguing.  The mystery woven through the story keeps the reader engaged. Characters are colorful and believable.  And, this really happened.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have seen in 2012!  There were a few deviations from the book, but overall I believe it followed the book very well.  The thought the acting was exceptional!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've had a number of people ask me whether I liked this book, and were amazed when I said \\"yes.\\" It wasn't the sexual content that I liked, but the character of Gray himself. I found him to be a fascinating study. There had to be some reason he was the way he was, and by the end of this series, it was fully explained.<br />Having worked with abused women, I was, at first, disgusted with the playroom and what went on inside, but Gray, himself, fascinated me. There were so many \\"shades\\" to his character, that I was impelled to discover what made him the way he was. Looking at this whole series from a psychological viewpoint, one can't help but be intrigued by him. The sex scenes, although extremely vivid, were necessary to be able to understand what made Gray tick. If you can get by all the sex, and look at it from a psychological view, it is one of the most amazing series I have ever read
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Really enjoyed this tale about a young shepherd, who goes on a quest for treasure, and ends up learning the meaning of life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great Read! Thought provoking, funny, tender. Makes for great conversations in my 5th grade classroom.  Everyone becomes a little nicer to each other after finishing this book.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I was all excited to have this for my Kindle Fire, and it didn't even work!  Oh well, just use a regular computer and printer.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|I hadn't read a John Grisham book for quite a while. I really enjoyed his early books,The Firm,A Time to Kill but this is just sticking to the formula and I really felt that not a lot of effort went into it. Actually a week later,I would be hard pushed to remember what this was about.
B006FZIETS|5.0|The Beautiful and the Damned is a book that deepens with each page.  It explores the relationship between friends and partners, the class structure of early twentieth century life in New York City, and the internal workings of its protagonist.  The language is both elaborate and modern, mirroring the edge of change on which the book's characters totter.  An extremely insightful and fascinating read.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is cute and easy to understand. It is good for toddlers too...for a little while, then they get bored. The teenagers like it too but then want a greater challenge. I liked it because it was free! It is very similar to a couple of other games that I have seen.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I was so impressed with this movie. I had initially ordered it more for my husband than myself. This is more his type of movie. But I decided to watch it with him. Wow! Was I surprised. The previews of this movie implied there was plenty of good action and good content and it most definitly delivered. And I loved the surprise ending. All in all an excellent movie and I highly reccomend it  to anyone and everyone!
B008M34CSI|3.0|This movie is a good waste of a few hours. The problem is that there is nothing original - you feel like you have seen this movie several times in the past in various incarnations.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Very repetitive in sexual/physical encounters in first part<br />but improves plot wise in the second and third parts of the trilogy.<br />Very expensive to download to Kindle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You are either going to hate it or love it. If you are looking for your Inner Goddess to come out this is the book that will treat her.<br />I couldn't book this book down.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Brilliant didn't want it to end what an awesome finale for the series wish there was more. Couldn't put it down fantastic
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved the book! The movie was good in its own right. It was exciting and fun to watch! I could watch it multiple times and not be bored.
B0028MBKVG|1.0|I tried and tried to read this book but ended up playing solitaire every time.  Unless you are into extreme running and the anthropology of an obscure Mexican tribe, skip this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is very good reading material. It has a great story to it and once you get into the first book it's hard to put it down.
B002SXUCS2|5.0|A great band makes a great album. After all, this is what GG is all about. I always start with the title track when I listen, and always have trouble turning it off before the album is done. Do yourself a favor and get this album.
B000EHSVOG|4.0|First things first; `The Towering Inferno' is a really good movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, as did my wife, and getting her to embrace a film pre-1990 is really difficult.  I'm not usually drawn to these classic disaster epics because they have a tendancy of being really corny in execution and so I wasn't really keen on seeing the film despite the marvelous cast (seriously, has there ever been a better cast than this?) but I caved in when I realized that it was up for a slew of Oscars, including Best Picture.  That doesn't always say much, but I decided it was best to see this.<br /><br />I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />Before I get into all the reasons I'm glad I watched this, I will lay out a few problems and the reason that this won't get a five-star review from me.<br /><br />First of all, conceptually this wasn't thought out enough.  To have a fire spark HOURS before it is really noticed is somewhat silly, especially when it is in a closet a mere few feet away from a secretary who should have smelled the fire.  I mean, it takes hours before the fire spreads past a small flame and for smoke to start billowing into the hallway.  It didn't make sense.  They should have just had the fire spark during the party and spread rapidly.  Continuing with plot issues, the film recycles some of the film's thrills too much and drags out the finale to a fault, serving up some questionable logic.  Second, the film is just too long.  It needed to be trimmed.  Not that it doesn't do a whole lot, and it wears it's near three hour running length well, but it still comes across very longwinded and needed some temperance with regard to the film's actual length.  Sadly, despite the running length, there is very little character development.  A few actors shine in their role (NOT Astaire, who's Oscar nomination is baffling to me), but no one really has much depth thanks to a script that doesn't care enough to make these people important.<br /><br />Still, with those glaring faults, the film is a whole lot of fun and almost all technical aspects of the film are prefect.  The cinematography win was WELL deserved, so rich and epic in scope without sacrificing the smaller details.  The production design, especially those set pieces of wrecked hallways and stairwells, are pitch perfect, and the costuming (Dunaway is stunning) is a lot of fun.  The special effects are top notch, even for today, and the overall ensemble is on point, especially McQueen, Holden and Chamberlain, who all brought an extra fire to underwritten roles (if ANYONE was going to get some sort of awards attention here, it should have been Richard Chamberlain).<br /><br />At the end of the day, `The Towering Inferno' sends chills and remains intense throughout.  It could have been tightened, but regardless, this is a disaster epic that earns the reputation it still has.aults, the film is a whole lot of fun and almost all technical aspects of the film are prefect.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|almost a year its been great.  no problems. with it I wish I could also. be more buttons or depth but great
B005D63ICI|5.0|Another thrilling season with more twists and turns. Dexter continues his battle with right and wrong in sunny Florida yet again, as a family man and father this time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app it's fun and gives you something to do if your bored. I recommend this app to anyone and its FREE.
B008602KQI|5.0|Git this as a gift for my niece. She loves, so, so do I. Great gift at a great price.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|Rancho Texicano, has 38 cuts of the best of ZZ Top, from \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" to \\"She's got Legs\\" makes any cruising trip, kayak paddling, or just sit back and revel in the pleasure of pure ZZ genius, last for hours.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Beautifully written, real and poignant.  One of the first books I've read in years where I could see myself in the character, and where I could take something of her experience and apply it to my own life to try and make myself more whole, as Cheryl did so successfully.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Good read but I think it was a little too expensive for Kindle.  One time read and no book to trade in for any credit towards another purchase.  May go to a book store and purchase others in thi series as the books are $6. new,  Good read though.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I read the whole book but could not understand the main character's inability to see his sons flaws.  There was indication of them from very early on in the boy's life and the father never wanted to see them.  Putting your head in the sand about your children in one thing but not seeing reality at all in another.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|Very good family movie...love that it's a true story..,really like Drew Barrymore in it. Shows what can happen when people come together for a common cause
B00846REIS|2.0|While the passion and undeniable desire are present, this story lacked originality and creativity. The storyline followed much too closely to Fifty Shades of Gray. I don't anticipate reading the follow up.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was looking for something to read.  My daughter recommended this trilogy.  Just a few pages into the story and I was hooked.  I buy Kindle books so as soon as finished this one I immediately downloaded the next book.  Anastasia Steele is a strong female character that reminds me of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Its a good movie. Great special features. Overall very enjoyable; however, I preferred the book, which I think is typical. A Good entertaining movie.
