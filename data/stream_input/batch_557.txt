B00005JOIF|5.0|Munich, directed by steven spielberg, arguably the best in the business gets it absoultely spot on this time after turkeys like terminal and war of the worlds.... <br /> <br />Excellent source material (vengeance by george jonas), and accompanied by his usual top-notch production crew, Spielberg beautifully blends choreographed action sequences with drama which is brutal and heart-wrentching to watch. <br /> <br />Eric Bana yet again proves that he is the best import to hollywood today since Rusell Crowe as he gives his finest, and nuanced performance... definitely Oscar worthy. <br /> <br />If movies can convey a message to the audience, then Munich does...an eye for an eye does not end a feud...it only fuels it  <br /> <br />
6304712499|4.0|SPAWN is one of the few comic book adaptations that actually looks and feels like a comic book.  Todd McFarlane's immensely successful graphic books is brought to the screen with exciting action sequences and mindblowing special effects, except for the head demon who looks like a refuge from Sesame Street.  Otherwise, the fx are great.  The story is pretty simple:  a CIA operative is betrayed by his boss and dies a fiery death.  He is sent to hell where he agrees to return to lead Satan's army if he can see his girlfriend, Wanda.  Five years have passed though and Wanda is now married to Spawn's best friend and they have a daughter.  Spawn wants revenge on his killer but must face his own inner turmoil in deciding to fight for good or evil.  Michael Jai White does okay as Spawn, but is burdened with heavy makeup and some inane dialogue.  Martin Sheen (doing his best Vincent Price) is hammy as the villain.  Good support from D.B. Sweeney as the friend and Nicol Williamson as the mysterious stranger.  But it's John Leguizamo, unrecognizable under his heavy clown makeup, who chews up the scenery as the vile and crude Violator.  He's the Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman all rolled up in one corpulent obscenity.  He's really the star of the movie.  The movie is entertaining and the scenery and music top notch, too.
B0009F2EPU|4.0|The first part of this Ring I owned was Gotterdammerung. In that production I noticed that the story, the impact of the drama, was made by the staging of Patrice Chereau and the acting prestations in the first place followed by the vocal performances of the singers. A kind of the other around considering the premise of opera. Having seen all four parts of the Boulez-Ring I stay with that first impression. Expecially Gwyneth Jones and Donald McIntyre are far better actors then they are singers. Their voices cannot bare the weight of the drama required in Die Walkure Act 3 (Brunnhilde and Wotan) and Gotterdammerung Act 3 (Brunnhilde)for example.     The staging, however, is superb. The great thing from this production is that Chereau, not just ripped Wagners Ring from the old German mythology, but replaced it with a world that looks like a combination of Jules Verne and ancient Greek in which an insight in the characters and their motives are given in a way that I did not see before. It is as accessible as an average arthouse movie. Many modern staging just seem to want to get away from the old bearskins and teuton heroism so much that nothing else is offered instead (except leaving the audience with Brunnhilde looking like Christiane F.  for instance - Stuttgarter Opera). What I appreciated in the world of the Chereau Ring is it's own atmosphere and use of images and elements that are not just post-modern but also functional. The Wotan-monologue in Act 2 from Die Walkure and the love-duet from Act 3 between Siegfried and Brunnhilde are so cleverly directed that every line sung here is important instead of just asking time from the audience.     Another big plus for me is the conductorship of Pierre Boulez. Fast without rushing, modern with great insight, he lets the music do its work. Personally I prefer that very much over conductors who emphasis to much on the so called dramatic moments and by that destroying the natural flow of the music. With his approach Boulezshows us the richness of Wagners score, instead of converting it into something more one-dimensional.    This is a great Ring cycle and I think a great version to have if you are interested in owning a Ring on DVD.
B000A7DVR2|3.0|This \\"Collector's Edition\\" leaves much to be desired!  Such a wonderful cult classic deserves better treatment, that's for sure!      Let me just say, if you already have the first edition on DVD, then you really don't need this one.  The new transfer is only \\"marginally\\" better at best!  And the \\"new\\" extras aren't worth the upgrade.  The biggest let down is the teaser trailer that was on the first edition is gone here!  The documentary is the same on both.  And while there is a wonderful photo gallery taken by the great (and grossly underrated) bridges himself, it still not enough bait to make the owners of the first edition bite!    I reccomend reading the review at dvdtown.com it's very helpful.    If you've seen this film, then you already know it's magic, let's just hope the third time on DVD will be the charm . . . . . .
B00003CXN4|2.0|What happened in this movie is that they are people who travel drugs from Mexico to U.S.A. The government of the United States have hired people that sale drugs so they can have the information to know where they can find the main person that is saleing drugs and stop this situation.   The setting is in  Cinncinati,Ohio in the Suburb of Indian Hill,Washington,D.C in the office of the Chief of Staff, Columbus,Ohio in the Satate Supreme Court where the government were discussing about drugs.  San Diego,CA  is the place where the police catch one of the drugs saler. La Jolla, California that is just outside of San Diego. El Paso Intelligence Center El Paso,Texas.  In addition the tone of the movie is negative because it all relates with drugs ad that makes the people feel like fustrade and make them upset. This also show how some people try to acquire power from others. For example when in the movie the police put mens that are polices and make them to act like  they are those drug salers. This is one way how these goverment or anyone can acquire power by tell them a lie or pretend something that is not true but they due it.   At the end the message of the movie was that it don't matter if you are rich or poor but there is always a time when anyone can lade down.Also it depends on you or on people that wants to help you they can get out of a situation like this one.However  this movie was a little it confusing at the end but it really has big messages to the audience.
0790736314|3.0|Great movie...great extras.<br /><br />My only beef with this thing was that all the extra crap was at the BEGINNING of the tape.  Maybe I dunno how this kind of thing works, but it seems to me that should be at the end.  It was REALLY aggravating to have to fastforward through all the interviews and stuff without knowing how much of it was on there.  It's obviously not an issue with the DVD version, but I really think it would've been a better idea to put all the extras AFTER the movie.<br /><br />That is all.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I bought this as an off chance following an Amazon recommendation. It is a superb album that for me is a modern day Joy Division album. IMO all Joy Division fans should love this album. I do not think I've heard anyone else review it and compare it with JD, but I certainly think there is huge similarity.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|If you haven't seen Batman Begins... rent it. If you agree with me, that this is one of the best movies of the year, and must have the inside scoop on how it was made, pick up this DVD set. The first disc is devoid of any features (except for the trailer and an MTV spoof), but the second disc is packed with just enough for this set to be worth the price. The second disc, however, does have a stange set-up that is made to resemble a comic book, so it is a bit tricky to navigate. It is possible, though. I didn't buy this exact edition, though. I bought the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" that has a single extra, a short collection of (3) original Batman issues that were inspiration for the film. It was a few dollars more than this version, but I enjoyed the little graphic novel. Regardless of this version or the deluxe (which is currently sold out on Amazon), this is a great DVD and definately something to purchase. I highly reccomend it.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I've seen articles on the Net that this CD contains DRM that prevents it from being played in some CD Players. Is this another SONY-like DRM issue? I'm not going to shell out $$ for a CD that I can't play. From what I've read, you can't even return the CD if you can't play it. The notice they provide to warn you that there might be problems is only on a sheet included inside the CD container - the warning is NOT visible on the outside of the CD. Unfortunately you don't know there might be an issue till you get it home and open the CD - - too bad you've shelled out $$$ for a CD that you can't play. Use it as a coaster I guess. <br /> <br />See this link for more details. <br /> <br />[...]

0307276902|5.0|Say what you want about the guy--he has a plan that works for him.  He is honest and I'm so glad he found a way to make a new life for himself when the odds were so against him.  I would completely recommend this book--just be prepared to feel some discomfort while reading it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this cd because so many people had told me how amazing it was. I bought it and the first song came on. It actaully scared me because of the loud hit. But I started to listen intently. Idina Menzel (also Maureen in RENT) gives her best performance to date. Her range is incredible and her voice is perfect for each song. She has a very low mysterious voice and a powerfully high section especially on Defying Gravity. But she also shows she can contain its power on For Good.  <br /> <br />Also Kirsten Chenoweth who is best know for Tony award winning place on You're A Good Man Charley Brown, stands out with her voice. She has a very operatic voice at times but it suites so many different styles. Its absolutly perfect for the part.  <br /> <br />Overall I was completely pleased with this CD and know that it will go down in Broadway history as an amazing and unique show. Here is my top 5 songs <br /> <br />1. For Good <br />2. Defying Gravity <br />3. As Long As Your Mine <br />4. What is this Feeling? <br />5. No Good Deed <br />
B000002J0B|3.0|The only problem of Led is that in terms of originality they are pretty poor. Musically they are perfect: with vibatring rithims coming from espetacular bonhan and amazing riffs from Jimmy Page leaving the feeling from the soul to JP Jones and Mr. Plant. However sometimes the feeling is that they are playing on the sames note the whole music, they don't variate oftenly, that causes a lack of quality that is one of the things that differs the real good bands from the common ones. This is the feeling I get when I listen to this Led CD: Lack of originallity.
0312995423|5.0|Intrinsically exciting and deliberately fast-paced, Digital Fortress is the epitome of modern thrillers.  With many plot twists and unexpected turns, Dan Brown continues to write in his realistic but intense style.  Digital Fortress starts out with the appearance of an unbreakable code and evolves into a desperate race against time and the seeking of an ever-elusive truth.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, especially its final pages. <br /> Readers of fantasy, adventure, mystery, and science fiction should read this book.  This read has the qualities of all these genres, along with an inexplicable quality that captures the reader's interest.  Even readers not familiar with these types of fiction should give this book a chance and find themselves content.
B0002X314C|5.0|this cd is great.  i love it so much.  bought it a year ago, and still listen to it a lot.  BUY IT!  just put it in the cd player and press play.  songs don't all sound the same, but has the same overall vibe throughout.  i love this cd and hope john puts out another great cd.  good singing, good piano player.  another great cd is anthony hamiltons.  if u like one, you'll probably like the other.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A great movie with an interesting story. Contains lots of violence (very graphic, but not gratuitous). Excellent acting, Ed Norton was SUPERB.
067101756X|5.0|I am an ex-Air Force, medical professional who became interested in UFOs after a [close!]sighting many years ago.  Col. Corso's story is very feasable given the government mentality regarding UFOs in the 50's and 60's; I was thoroughly drawn into the reverse technology \\"theory\\" of lasers, fiber optics, night vision, etc. I never believed that medical lasers and other medical technology (fiber optic scopes)were developed so fast, and perfected so precisely without \\"help\\". I have read much on this subject as well as UFO history, cover up, and sightings and this book cemented my belief that Roswell happened and at the least, gave us some valuable technology.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Great album. Songs are somewhat similar in style, but the musical quality of the album is great. The songs are catchy, interesting to listen to (some tell stories), that use a wide variety of instruments and synthesizers. Great stuff.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes have always been good at disguising their talent for songwriting and brilliant musicianship behind a faade of simplicity.  They've always rocked but it was the in-depth listening that made it clear this band was holding a bright light.  That light has burst through on their new release \\"First Impressions of Earth.\\"  They have a new producer and have left the low-fi, distorted vocals behind for a more powerful, clean and experimental sound.  Some of the most complicated and interesting drumming and guitar work explodes from The Strokes this time around; it had always been hinted at before, but they do not hold back here.  FIOE is not as off-the-cuff catchy as their first two albums, but after a few listens will leave its beautiful melodies and compositions stuck in your head.  It is great to hear The Strokes jump to this height of artistry...showing their critics up.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|This album has gotten pretty much over-hyped by now but even so, it is a terrific work of art. I've been listening to it since its release, but I'm still very conflicted, because there are some extremely remarkable songs on this album, while others are very much ho-hum. Illinois is a roller coaster of soaring great heights and lower quality pieces that really don't fit in. All in all, they need to figure out which direction they want to head in and stick with it. The album as it is, is too much a jumble.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I saw a lot of movies in 2005 - some good, some bad, some in the middle - but none of them affected me as deeply as King Kong. I know, that sounds silly, because this is a strange love story, a complicated love story involving a woman and an ape, but still, it got me.  <br /> <br />Naomi Watts did a brilliant job as Ann Darrow, the object of the giant ape's affection, and I really think she deserves an Oscar for her work. She just moved me and made the connection between Ann and Kong so real - it still haunts me weeks after seeing the movie. And KONG! Oh, the animators did such an incredible job! He seemed so real! And diverse! He was phenomenal! <br /> <br />Kudos to Jack Black also - I was a little uncertain of how he would fit into the film, but he was fantastic as the manically driven director, obsessed and fanatical. He made me think of a young Orson Wells.  <br /> <br />Adrien Brody did well as the reluctant hero, though he's not my usual cup of tea. He was fine and the romance between his character and Ann worked. <br /> <br />What I also loved was the homage to old New York, to a depression-era New York. Really well done and set the tone for the film right off. Then what a wonderfully dramatic shift to take a rocky sea voyage to the lush and dangerous Skull Island! Wonderful transitions. <br /> <br />I also loved the natives of Skull Island. For the first time, they really seemed scary (all other film incarnations made them seem tame and laughable). These islanders were DANGEROUS! And the island itself was frightening! The creatures on it were amazing and horrific. I even hid my eyes at one point (hate bugs and \\"the pit\\" was just too much for me). <br /> <br />But I believe that's what Peter Jackson wanted to do as a director of this film: to scare us and enchant us and make us feel! It was such a wonderful ride and I can't wait to go on it again! <br /> <br />Highly recommend it for anyone looking for action/adventure/romance/drama/comedy/fantasy. This filmhas it all!
B0002I831S|5.0|Read Cpt_Kirk's review, a few reviews down, that will explain to the confused reviewer why the episodes seem out of order. They are in order but in a special way. Just go read the review.
B000AUDHW8|4.0|I decided to risk the French release and am very happy I did. It is marked Mono on the DVD jacket but the music, songs and effects are in stereo, and listening to it under headphones was a treat ! It is in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio and can be seen in widescreen on a 16/9 TV in either the Zoom, Wide or Smart formats, so until the official DVD is released by B. Streisand, this will do very well.
0783230370|4.0|I have heard about this.  I heard that this movie is based on a true story.  Some guy actually got pregnant, and had cravings and everything!  In real life the guy is also a politician or something, that is probably why Arnold was chosen for the role, he is the perfect actor.  I can't remember where I heard that though.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|News is that a film is in development in the UK about that period of 3 days in August 1945 when the RAF dropped two A-bombs on Japan, thus ending the war. <br /> <br />As it is fiction and \\"Only a Movie\\" it is thought that Americans won't find too much to dissent about, especially as proper recognition will be made right at the very end of the movie, in small print, just before the credits.  <br /> <br />

However if you are interested in learning about Ferrazzi and his career development...with the hopes of learning a few methods or tips from him, you will get them.

But the book offers a quick, interesting, and motivating read.
B000AP04FG|5.0|OK, forget the fact that you either love or hate Brad and Angie right now..... <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS TERRIFIC!!!  Talk about action!  Not to mention the humor in it as well.

A must for independent women who love action movies.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I love David's voice on the chorus of Precious:<br /><br />\\"Things get damaged<br /><br />Things get broken<br /><br />I thought we'd manage<br /><br />But words left unspoken<br /><br />Left us so brittle<br /><br />There was so little left to give...\\"<br /><br />the imagery of Depeche Mode is is still abit dark, they always will be, but I have felt since Exciter a confidence and happieness in their lyrics that only comes with 24 years in music. I wanted to give PTA a 4 star but really how many bands after 24 years can release an album like this, with what the band has gone trough.<br /><br />The slower Gore tracks are weak, as they have been the past few albums. But David's voice still has that rough evil purr that we all love.<br /><br />Precious is the track that hit me immediately, (as well as Lillian) that made me smile and I think if you have following the band as I have you did too. Not because its accessible, but the lyrics seem to me a rebuttal to their harsh Blasphemous Rumors. So many bands left too early but I am happy with DM's direction and the five stars are WELL earned.<br /><br />If you don't know about Depeche Mode, get this album, Violator and Black Celebration. Great introduction to a very prolific band.
B000268QB2|5.0|I heard the song \\"Somewhere Only We Know.\\" and instantly fell in love with it because it isn't some rock guitar, electric, bubblegum song like most of the stuff on the radio these days. I purchased the album in 2004 and I'm still listening to it! ( I hadn't thought to write a review til now.) The lead singer of Keane is Tom Chaplin and his voice is incredible. It can be loud and deep or soft and high. Another thing I love about Keane is instead of a electric guitar they have a piano. I know some of you may like guitars and think pianos are just for boring classical music, but the way the piano is played and mixed with Tom's voice is wonderful to listen to and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Another thing about Keane is that their music is so inspiring.   1. Somewhere Only We Know- Great lyrics and cathcy song but doesn't show how great Chaplin's voice can be.    2. This is the Last Time- Another song I really enjoyed that  has an upbeat pace. More like a slower paced 'Bend and Break' but just as catchy.    3. Bend And Break - Definitely one of the catchiest songs on this album. Chaplin really belts out in it. I find myself singing along with this (which is a good sign). Perfect for exercising to.    4. We Might As Well Be Strangers- A beautiful and sad song that describes not being in love with someone anymore.This song will haunt you. Let the waterworks begin    5. Everybody's Changing- The band's second single. This is fun and moving with a real life concept of people moving on when you're not ready for them to. Rice-Oxely does a great piano job here and this track is extremely catchy.    6. Your Eyes Open- There isn't very much hype about this song, but I like it a lot. It has mysterious verses and a slightly eerie tone but is so great. This song actually really drew me into Keane    7. She Has No Time- This is one of my absolute favorite songs of all time because it is so beautiful and you can almost feel Chaplin's pain when you  listen ( Oxely-Rice wrote itfor him  after a girl rejected him) Tom also goes wonderfully falsetto on the chorus.    8. Can't Stop Now- One of the more inspiring songs that I enjoy listening to and find hard to stop in the middle of. Chaplin's breathing is close to distracting but not quite when into the song. The last minute is very touching and is my favorite part of the song. (\\"The motion keeps my heart running..\\")    9.Sunshine- It took me a long time to finally accept this song but now I do. Listen to it a few times. The lyrics are odd but at the same time they make sense. This track is a lot different than most on this CD, but in a good way                        10.Untitled 1-  I know this is probably the most disloved song on the album, but it's my second favorite (Bedshaped is 1st). It has such great lyrics that really speak to me (\\"You're not the one I hoped for, I'll see you on the other side) and a really cool but that makes me think of black and white pictures of my past. Very cool instrumental wise, also.Hughes does an incredible job on the drums near the end of the song.    11. Bedshaped- I can't exactly describe this song in mere words. You need to hear it to keep the amazing sense of emotion it washes over you. It starts out slow (with an insturment I suppose is the piano but it's hard to distinguish)) and continues on a soft chorus which will already have you thinking. Almost like it's transporting you to a different place, somewhere in your path or somewhere you've been looking for. The chorus is the most amazing part of this song. I can't even describe it. It's so powerful, the lyrics are so meaningful. I cry a lot during this song. It's so beautiful. The most perfect finale I could ever imagine.    Overall, Keane is one of my favorite bands and I think everyone should give them a chance. They don't cuss at all on this CD and there are no sexual or drug references. It can be soothing is one part and exciting and loud in another so Keane is for everyone .
B00003CX5P|1.0|Reviewing this as a film on its own merits without the Star Wars name behind it, I would admit that The Phantom Menace would have been a summer blockbuster family film followed by substantial DVD sales.  It certainly impresses with all of its spectacle.  But by today we would have mostly forgotten about it.  There is almost nothing engaging in this story.  Adventure stories always follow a hero through a quest.  This story is aimless, due partly to its backstory nature.  There is no main viewpoint character who we experience the story through.  There is no central quest for a hero and villian to grapple over.  Even the real villain of the film is a \\"Phantom.\\"  The child, Anakin Skywalker, who is supposed to be the central character has no drive, no personality, no motivation.  And he's blessed with the best case of good luck in the galaxy.  When have you ever heard a good story in which the hero destroys the villain's army completely by accident?  From a stuctural standpoint, the film feels like the director is simply connecting dots without infusing any soul into the story.  And the humor is downright insulting for anything other than the silliest of childrens films.  Strip this film of its Star Wars name and the magnificent John Williams score and you have nothing more than a soon forgotten summer movie.

B0007Q6PBK|5.0|La Boheme is certainly one of the top three performed Operas worldwide, along with Carmen and Aida. It is not my favorite Puccini Opera; that distinction goes to Manon Lescaut which, as opera critic Irving Kolodin so perfectly phrased it, is \\"the most of the promise, with the least cost of the fulfillment.\\" I don't begrudge Puccini his popularity: his music is often beautiful, the emotions direct and heartfelt. His librettos seem designed to tug the heartstrings in a plebian grab for popularity, like a television show tested by a focus group. But that's OK. So when I see a production of any of Puccini's most popular operas, I tend to concentrate on sound: the beauty of the instrumental music, the vocal qualities of the singers. I usually ignore the plot. A misguided fear of being manipulated by a master? Probably. I'm weird that way!<br /><br />So when I say I loved this DVD of La Boheme, that I was engrossed by the drama as well as the music, then it must be something special. The Met usually mounts traditional productions. When they stray from that conservative path, the audience tends to get ornery. This Boheme is a classic production: no \\"artistic license\\" shifting the action to the surface of Mars with a cast of farm animals and an orchestra of kazoos! I like a traditional Boheme, the way Puccini envisioned it. The emotions are less over-the-top, the drama more organic. The libretto is direct, even simple. That simplicity is the source of this production's excellence.<br /><br />Produced live on 15 March 1977 and the inaugural telecast of the PBS \\"Live at the Met\\" series, the DVD transfer effectively reduces many of the artifacts inherent to a 30 year old taped program. The image is still a little fuzzier than we're now used to, but not enough to drive you screaming up the wall. The DTS 5.1 sound is clear and full. As for the singing, both Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Renata Scotto as Mimi are at their absolute peak!<br /><br />This Boheme features a sublimely sung Rodolfo. All of the things Pavarotti was famous for are in evidence here: crystalline tone, perfect diction, fluidity of vocal quality. And this younger, svelter Pavarotti actually acts! I was moved by his performance in a part he obviously identifies with. As for Scotto, a leading soprano at the Met for two decades, her singing is lovely, with a limpid quality that heightens the emotionalism of her superb acting. The excellent cast includes Maralin Niska as Musetta and Ingvar Wixell as Marcello.<br /><br />James Levine had come into his own as a Conductor around this time. He offers a nearly perfect rendition of this verdant score. The Met Orchestra, obviously on the rise as one of the world's great ensembles, sounds wonderful. Watching them hang on Levine's every gesture, turning on a dime as they negotiate every twist and turn of this score, is one of the pleasures unique to the DVD format. As for the production design by Fabrizio Melano, it is simple and direct. It just looks right!<br /><br />I don't know if my atitude towards Puccini as a dramatist will ever change. But productions like this one, saved for posterity, are a clue as to why audiences adored Puccini in the first place. Before time and popularity seemed to cheapen the drama until it resembled a High School production of Cats. I love Puccini just like everyone does, of course. It's just that every now and again I need to be reminded why I love him. I strongly recommend this superb DVD. It's the jolt you need to get you in touch with your inner Rodolfo and Mimi.<br /><br />Mike Birmanly sung Rodolfo. All of the things Pavarotti was famous for are in evidence here: crystalline tone, perfect diction, fluidity of vocal quality. And this younger, svelter Pavarotti actually acts! I was moved by his performance in a part he obviously identifies with. As for Scotto, a leading soprano at the Met for two decades, her singing is lovely, with a limpid quality that heightens the emotionalism of her superb acting. The excellent cast includes Maralin Niska as Musetta and Ingvar Wixell as Marcello.  <br /> <br />James Levine had come into his own as a Conductor around this time. He offers a nearly perfect rendition of this verdant score. The Met Orchestra, obviously on the rise as one of the world's great ensembles, sounds wonderful. Watching them hang on Levine's every gesture, turning on a dime as they negotiate every twist and turn of this score, is one of the pleasures unique to the DVD format. As for the production design by Fabrizio Melano, it is simple and direct. It just looks right! <br /> <br />I don't know if my atitude towards Puccini as a dramatist will ever change.

B000BNI90O|5.0|I received this package today,on J. R. R. Tolkien's <br />birthday. The reason for the high price became apparent when  <br />opening it. It has the DVD on one side, with a firm peg to hold  <br />it in. The deeper other side contains the three cd's with a nice  <br />ribbon around them, to pull up the cd booklet. Under the ribbon  <br />lies the printed booklet. I became blind at birth, so couldn't  <br />get into that, but immediately I began browsing the dvd and  <br />cd's. The dvd sounds great, unfortunately my player would not  <br />allow forwarding and rewinding through the tracks, which became  <br />annoying, so I switched to the cd's. As one without physical  <br />sight, I can say that the music definitely contains the story.  <br />Often, it can let you know what goes on by itself. Hearing the  <br />complete score brings back the movie even more than the original  <br />soundtracks. It feels like the difference between the theatrical  <br />and extended versions of the movies, except even more so. The  <br />original soundtracks did the job, but the discerning listener  <br />would quickly realize the deletions, especially with the song at  <br />the end. This suite has it all! Firstly, Gandalf singing The  <br />Road goes Ever On helps add a vividness to the music. Bilbo then  <br />sings the same song, and with just the music, it actually sounds  <br />darker than in the movie. Hearing the music like this adds a  <br />full appreciation of its qualities. For me, the biggest  <br />highlight came at track eleven, The Passing of the Elves. I  <br />first got into LOTR when a friend invited me over to watch the  <br />movies. When the part with the wood elves came on, we both  <br />wanted to hear the song by itself. It sounds even more haunting  <br />and beautiful than it does in the movie. It gives the sense of a  <br />real Elvin choir. Other highlights include the song of Luthien,  <br />and the complete end music. The soundtrack cut off the second<br />song. This set delivers everything it promises, and more. It  <br />also felt very fitting to receive it on Tolkien's birthday.  I  <br />first became familiar with Tolkien's work almost two years ago,  <br />and it has shaped and improved my life immeasurably. To those  <br />who do not want to say that they have come to journey's end, this  <br />set and the knowing that the other two will come, can help keep  <br />Middle Earth alive within.
B000068TPN|5.0|Unlike other so-called \\"war\\" movies about Vietnam, this is actually a straight-up war movie.  Movies like \\"Apocolypse Now,\\" \\"Hamburger Hill,\\" etc were more DRAMA than war.  But for those people who like movies such as \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" \\"Bridge Too Far,\\" etc, this is the movie to see.  It's a war movie through and through.  My second favorite movie about Vietnam was the one which starred Alec Baldwin as McNamara - although that was more political, it was still a no-nonsense film about Vietnam. <br /> <br />Now I want to address the online reviewer who said that anyone who makes war is \\"not a good Christian.\\"  Obviously, that person had never read the Bible because in the Old Testament, they fought all the time.  And even St. Thomas Aquinas (a Christian SAINT) justified the \\"just war.\\"  The Vietnam War was fought to keep the North from conquering the South - if that's not just, I don't know what is. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the little sideshow where Barry Pepper was taking pictures of the battle.  Sure, war is horrible, but it's necessary.  War is the only thing on this planet that drove the fascists out of Europe.  War is the only thing that stopped Saddam Hussein from annihilating the Kuwaitis.  And war is the way we won our freedom. <br /> <br />If you want peace, move to a country like Sweden.  They were so pacifist, they allowed the Nazis to drive right through their country and destroy Norway.  Way to go, pacifists.

0060763280|3.0|I've seen Eker live and agree that he's an engaging speaker. I like this new book with some reservations.<br /><br />The core of Eker's teaching is that thinking produces behaviors which produce results. He steps further back, though, and asks where our thoughts begin and this, I think, differentiates him from other teachers on success. He advises that you look to your past to discover the contents of your `file cabinets' (those nascent thought patterns that lead to ideas and behavior) as they pertain to wealth. Do you harbor ideas that wealthy people are selfish or that circumstances dictate your success? Eker believes that these ideas set your `wealth thermostat' and limit your success.<br /><br />He lists seventeen thought patterns of wealthy people and gives a few exercises at the end of each chapter to help you `adjust your thermostat' to align yourself with the more successful.<br /><br />I found the seventeen thought patterns interesting but grimaced at some of his ideas. He talks about how you have to `involve the whole you' by stating `declarations' that send vibrational energy to every cell in your body and that, somehow, (no explanation offered), this will set you up for wealth. He also almost completely discounts circumstance, market forces, or anything other than your `internal wealth thermostat.' Don't be surprised, either, that the book is basically a marketing tool. There's good information here but not much that is new. The real goal here is to get you into the seminar loop and he reminds you of that on just about every page.<br /><br />All in all, though, it's a good little book with plenty of good advice.

B00005U122|5.0|I should probably start with the statement that both my husband and I are huge Pink Floyd fans.  The fact is it was one of the big reasons we went out in the first place, and our first date was to a Pink Floyd light show at a planetarium.  However we love their older stuff, when Waters was still with the group.  I came across this DVD a few years ago and decided to buy it.  It turned out to be the best DVD I have ever bought.  We have since purchased a dozen copies and have a few at home, and gave the rest to a bunch of friends and family members.<br /><br />We recently watched \\"The Wall: Live in Berlin, 1990\\", which was also performed by Roger Waters and his new band and think that \\"Roger Waters - In the Flesh\\" is a superior DVD.  It has a great selection of songs (from several albums, plus some new stuff) and the quality of sound is excellent.  Even our dog likes to sing to large number of songs from this DVD.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I'll be the first to admit.  5 years ago, I was saying, \\"Dream who??\\"  After being re-quainted with the \\"GOOD\\" Headbangers Ball music (see - \\"Pull me Under\\"), I became an instant fan. Hell, even my ring-back tone on my cell phone is \\"As I Am.\\"<br /><br />After 5 years of listening to them only on CD and seeing them in DVD's, I finally got the chance to see them live at Annie's in Cincinnati this past summer and have decided that they just keep getting better and better.<br /><br />This CD is the only CD that I've bought 3 copies of - just so I have a copy with me pretty much whereever I go.  One is in my car, one in the house, and one is at my boyfriend's, even though he's a major fan as well.<br /><br />All of the songs are powerfully written, and if Clear Channel radio would get their head out of their 'holes, they would realize that DT is out there and SCREAMING to be played.  I can really see \\"These Walls\\" or \\"I Walk Beside You\\" being played on mainstream radio, or at least VH1. (More music videos, guys?)<br /><br />\\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is the song that really brought me down to earth after rocking as hard and as loud as my stereo would let me. The lyrics re-tell the story of 9/11/01 and will never let us forget those that we lost.<br /><br />After also purchasing G3 (DVD and CD) and a Petrucci signature model MusicMan guitar for my boyfriend for Christmas this year, you'd think I'd be DT'ed out.<br /><br />Far from it, my friend. They keep getting better and better.

0143034901|2.0|All in all it makes you want to flip the pages, but if this guy wins much acclaim as a writer of anything but novels that kill time I'll go mad. My low rating of this book is one that reflects its marketing as a work of literature comparable to M&aacute;rquez or his peers. Most of my dislike for this book is a result of diving into it with the expectation of wit, not just something to look over while waiting at the barber shop.<br /><br />A few of the critic's reviews at first gently mock the tactic of comparing a new author to several well known ones, then go ahead and do it anyway. They drop names like Kafka, M&aacute;rquez, Borges and compare Ferm&iacute;n to Sancho Panza. This is much like comparing the boxing technique of a silver-gloves amateur to Oscar De La Hoya. However, perhaps comparing the author's style to various authors of the past is entirely appropriate because he mimics potboilers to such an extent that the book is miserably predictable. Zafon does not satirize melodramatic fiction: he merely contributes another member to its ranks.<br /><br />Furthermore, his literary allusions are infuriatingly lazy devices which add pretension to the novel rather than meaning. Here's a brief summary of the way literary allusions function in the novel:<br /><br />Zafon: \\"Hey! Look at all these literary allusions I threw in my story! They're from French, Spanish, Italian, and English! I must be really smart!\\"<br /><br />Reader: \\"Hey! Look at all these literary allusions that are thrown in the story! They're from French, Spanish, Italian, and English! I was forced/forced myself to read them! That makes me feel really smart! Zafon must be really smart, too! He's the real deal.\\"<br /><br />Zafon: \\"Cha-ching!\\"<br /><br />Most authors are not savvy enough to calculate a novel to appeal to readers' vanity.<br /><br />One of the exceptions to this is Ferm&iacute;n's ability to recite parts of the Divine Comedy, which plays nicely into his having been though hellish torture. However, most of the allusions are annoying.<br /><br />What I like about the book is the engaging (though inconsistent) narrator and the generally well-rendered suspense. The plot progresses like a quest in one of today's role-playing video games: Daniel goes from character to character and learns bits of information to piece the story's mystery together. This is the sort of entertainment provided by The Shadow of the Wind: tense but menial repetition.<br /><br />Perhaps the language could be more riveting with a different translator, but compare the prophetic description of the drought in 100 Years of Solitude to the library of forgotten books in The Shadow of the Wind. You will find that there is little to compare.ver, most of the allusions are annoying.  <br /> <br />What I like about the book is the engaging (though inconsistent) narrator and the generally well-rendered suspense.

B0000062FL|5.0|With the overwhelming success of Santana's debut album, the pressure was on to come out with an album as good or even better.  Santana responded with Abraxas, which, like its predecessor, went platinum, number 1, and it sold millions worldwide.  Black Magic Woman went on to become the band's biggest hit, and Oye Como Va became the biggest selling latin song ever.  Abraxas sent the band to the top of the charts and into the ears of listeners all over the world.  <br />Their first album introduced a new and exciting type of music, although it was somewhat rough and un-polished.  Abraxas took the music into a new more refined level. <br />This remastered version has three additional live tracks, Se A Cabo, the not yet released Toussaint L'Overture, and Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen.  They surely aren't the best live versions of these songs, but they are, however, very well performed.
B000803CVG|5.0|Probably the most joyous time to be a Prince fan, considering how incredibly positive the album is, along with the accompanying tour that's been deemed Prince's best to date. Songs such as \\"Eye No,\\" \\"Glam Slam,\\" \\"Lovesexy,\\" \\"Dance On,\\" and \\"Alphabet St.\\" demonstrate as the albums most energetic tracks, while \\"When 2 R In Love,\\" \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" and \\"Positivity\\" show off his creative writing abilities. <br /> <br />Lovesexy is a gem for any Prince fan - especially the tracked version. Don't let the album cover fool you.

0679720200|5.0|Reading this not too long yet so deep novel, I cannot help but visualize Camus' picture of which he is smoking a cigar with such pensive expression on his face.  <br /> <br />It may seem, to some people, that Meursault was an absurdly hopeless man who apparently had no emotion whatsoever. But as his attitude, if any, toward life shows it is all a matter of choice. Whichever may have its own value. <br /> <br />Just like what existentialism sees in life. <br /> <br />The beauty of ascetic life echoes A.Camus words: <br />In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.
B00079HZUM|4.0|The inevitable comparison for this movie is to Shakespeare in Love if only because it is about seventeenth century actors performing Shakespeare from moviemakers whom are more interested in the dramatic potentials of this than historical accuracy. And they're both love stories. But wheras Shakespeare in Love was too-clever-by-far (which, frankly, is not a problem for me) and devolves as much into a spot-the-connection puzzle with 1930s romantic comedy elements, the makers of Stage Beauty go for an interesting character portrayal as the heart of their movie, and the clever bits and romance are only stage dressing that adorns this beauty. Mr. Kynaston (Billy Crudup in a masterful portrayal) is an actor at the top of his chosen profession: portraying the women's parts in Elizabethean drama (mainly Desdemona, although other roles are aluded to). Maria/Mrs. Margaret Hughes (Claire Danes) is his adoring dresser, who has watched him so closely that she can mimic his part, useful in her desire to be the first woman to perform in English theater, which she does. Kynaston's egoism regading his profession along with his cynical nature leads him to make several enemies who take advantage of their positions to have him beaten, then to have the king reverse the ban on women in the theater as well as banning men from assuming women's roles. Kynaston's fall from grace mirrors Maria's rise, but that's only half the movie. Although your sympathies are with Maria--the much more likeable character--it is Kynaston who undergoes the biggest transformation and provides the movie with both pathos and message.<br /><br />I was surprised I liked the movie as much as I did. I think I expected more of a costume drama, tied to its historical time and place, and for the sympathies to solely be with the male actor, displaced by the march of progress. That it was neither, and yet had echoes of this, was the surprise. If anything, the entire character set grew from the events that took place, and while some were hurt in the process, they all came out better and stronger, and that's a pretty unusual story.while some were hurt in the process, they all came out better and stronger, and that's a pretty unusual story.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This was a sad movie based on the true story of Brandon Teena. A female living as a male. Brandon never felt like a female even though he was. Brandon always felt as though he were a male and so decided to move to a town where he could live as a male. I don't uderstand gays, lesbians, or those who are one sex but mentally feel as though they are the opposite sex but I dont have to understand them to treat them with respect and dignity. When Brandon was raped, the cop that interviewed him should have lost his badge right then. He treated Brandon so unfairly and was cruel. I feel he should also be held responsible for his murder. Had the cop done his job these people could have been spared. The cop was out of line in the way he questioned Brandon! Way out of line! It makes one wonder how many other law enforcement has done this same thing. This movie was so sad and heart-breaking....to know there are people out there in the world that will kill someone just because they are different or live their life in a way that many do not understand is sad. And to know we have cops out in the world that are suppose to uphold the law and protect but instead are so judgemental that they cost others their life. The men that killed Brandon, and the others took the lives of innocent people....took a mother from her baby and took these young people from their loved ones and yet they are still living....yeah sure they are in prison but for now they are alive. Brandon Teena was a victim of a hate crime...and the others that were killed were killed because they were there with Brandon. But these two men will have to face God on judgement day for what they did to these innocent young people. AS WILL THE COP THAT MAY HAVE PREVENTED THIS FROM HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH IF HE HAD DONE HIS JOB! As you will see in the movie. Another thing...the press should have kept there nose out of Brandon's arrest instead of printing that Brandon was female. That really hurt Brandon....just after the press printed this...Brandon was raped!  This movie shows the struggles Brandon faced and how mean people can be. An excellent movie but a very sad movie. I found this movie to tell much of the actual events as they happened. I had read the book on Brandon Teena...All She Wanted. The actress Hilary Swank did an outstanding job playing Brandon! I recommend this movie. Watch it and see how judgemental some people are and also how some law enforcement are also judemental...seeing only what they choose to see...and helping only those they choose to help. This movie will not only break your heart but will also make you angry!

0517053616|1.0|I was given this edition of Shakespeare for a Christmas one year when I was young. Once I began to appreciate Shakespeare, I did some readings in this work. It was okay.<br /><br />Then it became painfully obvious: with no line numbers, no margin space for notes, abridged names, no footnotes nor any research, it became rather difficult to closely study Shakespeare with this edition.<br /><br />That is when I purchased the Norton edition of Shakespeare. Although there are still abridged names, it has a very clear layout, notes, and enough margin to make anybody happy.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|For everyone that's groaning about the 2010 release date - it's a typo.  All you have to do is check the Internet Movie Database (the official public database for the industry, found at [...]) and check the release dates section for this title and you'll see that the proper US release date is January 10, 2006 (it's at the bottom of the release dates list). <br /> <br />Okay, for the actual review, I've seen an import version of this and absolutely loved it!!  I never actually played the original video game, and only really know a little bit about it, but I was able to keep up with the story just fine.

B0002IU988|4.0|I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of how this band would work, as the most memorable part of Creed had always been the vocals. Sure, Scott Stapp is not an especially strong vocalist, the studio does a good job of cleaning up his voice and covering up the weaknesses. In fact, Stapp is notorious for giving some of the worst live performanes in the past 10 year, including one time where a vast majority of the audience asked for their money back. Fortunately, however, Alter Bridge had put together an exremely pleasing album. Myles Kennedy's voice has grown on me, and Mark Tremonti puts on a guitar clinic. Some of his solo's are absolutely execeptional.    The songs:    Find the Real -- A strong opening track which gives the listener a good impression of how this album is going to go: Kennedy shows off his range, while Tremonti shows how capable of a guitarist he really is. The drumming fits in perfectly with the guitar, although the bass is a bit lost in the mix. 5/5    One Day Remains -- The title track is just as strong as the opening track. Kennedy's range has increased even further. Also, the bass is used perfectly. This is one of the best tracks on the album. 5/5    Open Your Eyes -- The album is still going strong with \\"Open Your Eyes\\". Kennedy's voice is fairly calm until the very end of the song, when it really explodes. The lyrics are a little repetitive, which is Alter Bridge's biggest problem on this album. Also, a good thirty seconds of the song is devoted to Kennedy going \\"ooooooooooh\\" over and over again. If the time was cut in half, it would fit in nicely, but the song picks up again after some nice guitar. 4.5/5    Burn it Down -- This track showcases what is probably the best lyrics on the album. The vocals, for the most part, are very dull, and the percussions are quite repetitive. The backup vocals, which usually fit well with Kennedy, are grating here. 3.5/5    Metalingus -- \\"Metalingus\\" is my favorite song on the album. Kennedy's vocals are so strong here and his range is truly exceptional. The bass is at its strongest here, and the guitars and drums fit perfectly. The song is by far the most energetic on the album and can really excite the listener, especially when the drums kick in heavy. 5/5    Broken Wings -- This song provides a good variety. For the most part, its very calm, even dull. Yet when the chorus comes, the vocals and instrumentals explode. This song features the strongest lyrics so far. 4.5/5    In Loving Memory -- By far the softest song on the album, \\"In Loving Memory\\" is probably the song off this album you'd most likely find on a Creed album. The vocals drag a bit, but as with the previous track, the song picks up during the chorus, before falling down again. It's a nice change of pace. 3.5/5    Down to My Last -- An even better change of pace, back to the more intense music of the first few tracks. The song also features the best guitar solo on the album, which is absolutely tremendous. The song is well written and all of the instruments are great. 5/5    Watch Your Words -- \\"Watch Your Words\\" is my least favorite song on the album. The vocals drag, and the guitars and lyrics are rather uninspiried. It isnt a bad song, by any means, but it does stand out as being the worst song on the album. 3/5    Shed My Skin -- Fortunately, the album recovers right here with a great tune. Everything is just right on this song and there is absolutely no room for complaint... perfect vocals, nice guitary, strong drums and poignant bass and lyrics. 5/5    The End is Here -- The closing track sums up this album nicely. It also features one of the cachiest set of lyrics I've heard in awhile. It's unfortunate that this is the last song, but at least Alter Bridge goes out with a bang. 4.5/5      Overall, this is a very good album. The vocals and guitar are exceptional and the bass and percussion fit perfectly. It's apparent that the three ex-Creed members have more talent than their former band allowed them toshow. My biggest complaint is that there are only 11 tracks. Fortunately, the album still clocks in around 50 minutes. Still, it would be nice on the next release to see a couple more tracks.
0307276902|5.0|For those who have rated A Million Little Pieces poorly, it is evident they have never been around anyone with a chemical addiction. Every word Frey has choosen to put on paper is necessary for the reader to understand how vile, evil and monstrously horrible living through a situation like this can be...not only for him but for anyone. There are only two things worse. One, the addiction ends in death. Two, being sober and watching someone you care about go through any part of what an addict experiences. <br /> <br />On the surface Frey outlines the horror of the addiction: what it looks like, feels like, smells like and how The Fury rises. I can't think of a better word than he has choosen to impersonate The Thing within an addict that will not leave them alone. Fury says it all. <br /> <br />Beneath the surface, the loathing, rage The Fury creates is drawn out and characterized as vividly as any of the human characters. Getting an in-your-face, upclose and repetitive look at The Fury is what every single person needs to examine. The Fury lives in all of us, but manifests itself differently in different people. <br /> <br />Frey's personality is very vivid and he is pretty damned tough. Annoying? Perhaps. Obnoxius? A little.  Who wouldn't be a tough obnoxious and annoying person living the way he had for so many years? I tell you what...every alcoholic and every drug addict have very similar characteristics. They just come in different degrees. There are no lovable addicts of any kind. Under the influence they don't feel good, but The Fury persuades them they'll feel better if they just keep using. <br /> <br />To the professional reviewers who call Frey's rejection of AA and The 12 Steps a gimmick...look at the statistics. AA and The 12 Steps are all any rehab institution has to work with and there is only a 17% success rate. That would translate to the idea that only 17 out of every one hundred people who go through treatment can actually buy into the theory. Doing the math, 83 out of 100 people either don't believe in a God of any kind or cannot believe a God of any kind would accept them just the way they are...and by the way, The Fury is there to assist in the thinking. <br /> <br />To those who support AA and The 12 Steps...thank goodness, for without them our entire country would be consumed by dangerously non-productive members of society. Millions and millions of people have benefitted from the program. But the 83% who have not continue to keep rehab facilities full on a daily basis...almost always with a waiting list.  <br /> <br />While James' persona is that of a white, rich kid gone bad, addiction is blind to race, creed, color and social status. It's in the book and it is all around you. And just because his parents forked over a sum of money to put him in the treatment center...I know from experience, no matter how much it costs, every treatment is the same and the success of the treatment is totally dependent on the values and attitudes of the addict. If they don't want to get better on their own, they won't. Period. <br /> <br />The repetition in the book that has caused some people difficulty could be seen this way: The only way to become addicted to something is to constantly and aggressively repeat the process of using a substance. Hence, on the other side of addiction, coming out of the dependency, the mind repeats its thoughts over and over again. Frey is not telling you how it is...he is showing you how it is. And that is the sign of a very good writer. <br /> <br />This book has opened my awareness even more and given me more understanding of the depths of addiction. I know have seen The Fury and understand it. If you don't believe in a heaven, you can certainly believe in a Hell.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|This has one awsome menu! Very cool and up to speck with the FX that has been going on Atlantis, now i get to see all the episodes i missed with joe flannagin every day!!! I'm extremly ecstatic to have the box set, I can't wait for S2! As for any problems anyone might have said with playing the dvd's I've encountered none. The menu may be a tiny bit confusing but you get the hang of it quick. Other than that it rocks! Thanks for Season 1 and Rockon Atlantis Crew!
6305558167|5.0|This movie is the closest thing you will find to the story of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail. This movie is full of love, magic, and medieval warfare, all of which make an excellent Arthur movie. Especially the medieval warefare. I recommend this movie for any King Arthur or medieval movie fan. This is the best I have ever seen.
B000062YAZ|5.0|30 minutes of the best thrash metal ever. crisp recording, great overall vibe. shreds. doesnt get better.
B000001FO4|4.0|Cinderella's first album, Night Songs, was a hair metal classic. Their second album, Long Cold Winter, tones down the rock and their sound becomes more bluesier than before. This album is alot mellower but is still good none the less. Songs like \\"Gypsy Road\\" and \\"Bad Seamstress Blues\\" really rock. The song everyone knows from this album is \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\". The song is probably one of the best known and best loved power ballads of the 80s. If you liked their first album, try this album.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|Hate the fact that Davis used outside writers, and the fact that the sound is too polished. The days of heavy Korn are gone im affraid. Guess ill go back to listening to the debut cd and remembering the real times. the times when the band was hungry and had aggression. there is none of that here. sorry guys, but this was not the right direction to go in. gad, it pisses me off to say that... what a drag.
0393327655|5.0|With straightforward, accessible logic, Mr Harris clearly reveals the mechanism of intellectual corruption resulting from clinging to ancient superstitions & mythologies. <br /> <br />Believe in UFOs? - Your nuts. Think that ESP could be a reality? - get real. Believe in a magical being born of a virgin who walked on water, was the true son of of 'God' & was resurrected? - Your 'faithful'. We can no longer afford to indulge in this insanity. Mr Harris provides ample resoning why. <br /> <br />An indispensable new guide for the perplexed.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I've been a Bob Dylan fan for a few years now, but the feeling has been reinforced a thousand times after seeing this. I always thought that the best Dylan was the mid-60's Dylan. After seeing the film, I have a greater appreciation for the folk revival, and some of the music that preceded it. Woody Guthrie was genius, Hank Williams was genius, and the mournful sonnet by Odetta was haunting, but still genius. <br />The thing I liked most about the movie was that the viewer was able to identify with the thought process of Dylan. You were able to personally feel what he felt. I was very proud of the fact that Dylan didn't care what critics thought. He did his own thing. He didn't 'turn his back' on anything. He simply evolved. The roots were still there. It may be true that as an entertainer, keeping the audience amused or 'entertained' is important, but if it means compromising your own wishes and your own amusement, then you've lost your rights to perform.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Yes, this cd is typical Enya...thank God!  I love it...can't stop listening to it.  My favorite...Drifting.  The use of the cello really added something to the song...quite a moving piece.  The first time I heard it I played it over 5 times in a row!  Very calming, soothing sounds from the woman who uses her voice as an instrument and reaches new heights everytime!
B000BTC5LW|1.0|I have to ask. Why are the people complaining about the continual delays in this DVD release giving this nonexistent DVD 4 stars?  <br /> <br />The concert deserves 4 stars, but Gilmour, the rest of the band and the other powers-that-be deserve only 1 star or no stars for the 10+ year delay in getting this released on DVD. WT#?! That's more than just stupidity. It's BS and it's unacceptable! What are they thinking or not thinking that they continue to delay this thing? I say the delay is 10 years, not 12 because to be fair, DVDs didn't hit the market until 1996. The concert was in '94. But there's no friggin excuse for this ridiculously long delay!  <br /> <br />The specs of the DVD are impressive, but they're only hurting themselves in holding out on this. The longer the delay, the more interest will wane and the more bootlegs will have eaten away at what COULD HAVE BEEN or WOULD HAVE BEEN a very popular and best selling DVD.  <br /> <br />Have Gilmour and Waters been at it again behind the scenes, squabbling over royalties, or has this been one very long momentary lapse of reason? A 10 year lapse of reason.  <br /> <br />If they really wanted to outbootleg the bootleggers, they would have just resolved their differences, or gotten over themselves and released this with similar specs a long time ago.  <br /> <br />What are the reasons? Was it a 10 year momentary lapse of reason, or money? Is it a matter of us and them? Us wanting to enjoy that concert in 5.1 sound, and them wanting to buy a football team? Or perhaps a LearJet by letting the demand build?  <br /> <br />Looks to me like they may be rebuilding that wall between themselves and their fans.  <br /> <br />If their answer to the release date question is, \\"When pigs fly\\" my answer would be, \\"And I'm, still waiting!\\"  <br /> <br />It's time for the lame excuses, if there are any to end! Tell us when or else those bootlegs will just continue to circulate and proliferate.  <br /> <br />I've got a suggestion. If it's not about money for them, then why not release this DVD and Dave & friends could donate a portion of the DVD sales to one of those Live 8 charities. They're loaded anyway! They could choose to donate most all of it to charity if they wanted to. Some people besides themselves would actually benefit from it then. It would go to a good cause.
B000AARKO4|5.0|I purchased this movie yesterday and couldn't be happier that I have it in my DVD collection.  I was worried because I didn't think Orlando Bloom could carry the movie, but he did a fantastic job.  I couldn't get past picturing him as the elf in Lord of the Rings, but now I see him with new respect for his talent.  The music, the directing, the acting...all top notch.  A great film for lovers of history.  You won't be disappointed if you give it a try.  You will be left craving more information on the subject.  I intend on getting some books on the crusades because of this movie, as my collection of history books is lacking in that area.  Enjoy!
B00005ASOI|5.0|A Dance Academy in Germany was the selected stage for Dario Argento to drive us an authentic horror Rock Opera. The visual aesthetic is of first-rate; the handle camera is very innovative; great frames, the visual field is enriched with the accurate employment of the objective and lenses. This macabre story deals with weird voices from the outer world and  sinister pacts and witches.<br /><br />Jessica Harper owns a spelling beauty that contributes to accent the dark atmosphere of this worthy suspenseful tale. The soundtrack is supported by The Globbins.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Critics said the same things about this album, over and over again: \\"underwhelming\\", \\"same territory as IS THIS IT\\", \\"repetitive\\", \\"boring\\", etc.  I almost can't believe that they actually listened to ROOM ON FIRE.  However people try pigeonhole The Strokes, I'd like to see them say they don't find Casablancas, as a songwriter, one of the most talented men in music these days. <br /> <br />If you are expecting The Strokes to \\"save rock and roll,\\" you are a fool.  Now, if you are expecting catchy, melancholy, all-around beautiful music, you will be supremely pleased.  This is a truly magnificent album from one of the best bands in the world.
038551123X|4.0|I avoided this book when it came out, thinking the idea of a serial killer who kills serial killers was gimmicky and unlikely to enlist my sympathy.  Lindsay does a great job, though, very seriously attempting to capture the mindset of his main character, a kind of homicidal Mr. Spock whose foster father, a cop, has trained him to slay only horrific monsters.  It's also pretty funny -- sort of a \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" thing, almost.  The one drawback to this book is that (as in \\"Motherless Brooklyn,\\" come to think of it) the mystery is weak.  But I am very much looking forward to the subsequent entries in this series.
B0000027RL|5.0|I saw Pearl Jam in Houston, TX at The Unicorn (a gutted Kroger Store) with Soundgarden in 1991 or 1992. Pearl Jam's performance was so raw and visceral unlike any other I've seen except perhaps when I saw Elvis as a small child at the Houston Astrodome. I've seen Pearl Jam many times since but nothing's like your first time! I saw them at Lollapalooza in New Orleans and Houston and if I recall correctly once with Nirvana. I prefer Pearl Jam and always will. Eddie Vedder's voice is unique and sensual in the same class with Barry White for me. This is one of those classic albums that will be on every must have list for generations to come.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I have not seen as many westerns as other movie maniacs, but 'Once Upon A Time in the West' is among the best I have seen from that genre.  Even though it has a star-studded cast, the real star of the film is the director, Sergio Leone.  This man represents something modern filmmaking has virtually lost; a real director who has tell and story in epic and sweeping fashion, with vision and imagination, and with true class.  The story is rather complex, but at the center of it are rutheless outlaws and greedy railroad barrons who are fighting amongst each other.<br /><br />Charles Bronson is one of the stars as the mysterious harmonica - playing loner who is looking for Frank (Henry Fonda).  The reasons are unknown, but Bronson appears and kills three henchmen in one of the most brilliant opening sequences in movie history.  From then on, the viewer is thrown into a deeply complex story result in a fantastic shootout between Bronson and Fonda.  What makes the ending even more memorable is a shocking and hair-raising flashback before the shootout.  This film is quite and experience, but it is almost ruined by the poor English dubbing.  If one is watching the DVD, they should switch the language and watch the movie in French with English subtitles.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The Big Lebowski is a work of comic genius; it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Jeff Bridges is hilarious as \\"the Dude,\\" a pretty simple guy whose life goes all kinds of topsy-turvy after he's mistaken for someone else with the same name - Jeffrey Lebowski.  John Goodman is hilarious as his best friend Walter Sobchak, a boisterous Vietnam vet with a quick temper and a pathological need to jump in and take decisive action all the time, and Steve Buscemi is his usual entertaining self as the only reasonably sane person in the entire film.  The Big Lebowski is really all about dialogue and delivery.  The script is just wickedly funny from start to finish, but it is Bridges' laid-back delivery that really makes the comic engine go, with all kinds of help from John Goodman.<br /><br />The Dude comes home one night, only to find himself thrown face-down in the toilet and otherwise accosted by two chaps demanding money to pay off his wife's debts.  He finally manages to convince the guys that he is not the Jeffrey Lebowski they are looking for - but not before one of the jokers gives his rug a golden shower.  The Dude is not at all happy about this, as \\"that rug really tied the room together.\\"  After consulting with his bowling partners (the Dude spends a lot of time bowling), he decides to find the other, obviously rich Lebowski and ask him to reimburse him for the rug.  Soon thereafter, the Big Lebowski calls him in and asks him to serve as the courier for a money drop to some guys who kidnapped his pretty young wife Bunny (Tara Reid).  That's when all the trouble really starts.  The Dude's soon mixed up with all sorts of crazy people (including a gang of nihilists), while Walter manages to get him deeper and deeper into a lot of trouble he never wanted in the first place.  There are indeed lots of strands in the Dude's head as the whole story takes a series of odd twists and turns, each of them funnier than the last.  And he's got to get ready for the big semifinals of bowling league play, to boot - Walter is very, very dedicated to the bowling league games.  It's almost impossible to give a good overview of the plot, and I wouldn't want to do so anyway, as you really have to experience it all for yourself.<br /><br />You've got to love the Dude.  He's just a lazy slacker who wanted his good, clean rug back, and then all this crazy stuff happened to him.  Rest easy, though, knowing that \\"the Dude abides.\\"  Sometimes, that's about all you can do in this crazy world.  I should mention that the film more than earns its R rating for profanity, as about every third word anyone says is a curse word - so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may be \\"out of your element\\" here.  I am quite confident, though, that most viewers will laugh themselves silly watching this movie and will want to keep on watching it over and over again.  The Coen Brothers hit a grand slam with this one.semifinals of bowling league play, to boot - Walter is very, very dedicated to the bowling league games.

0553573403|2.0|There are a lot of people warning that this book is a little disturbing or graphic and some people have labelled it R.  I think that is FAR to generous.  This book should not be sold to anyone under 18.  The scenes of graphic sex are more shocking and sick than penthouse letters.  For example the graphic description of sex with an under-aged pregnant girl covered in horse blood really beg the question \\"was this necessary\\"?<br /><br />The only reason this was not labelled a romance novel is that the sex, while gruesomely graphic, is not fun, sexy, or romantic.<br /><br />In My Opinion, A fantastic, complex story that was needlessly dragged into the gutter by sadistically graphic tripe.  If you can look past, or better yet, skip over these parts there is a very good story in there.  But it is not the great fiction masterpiece that everyone is hailing it.  A great masterpiece can be enjoyed at any age, this book cannot.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|and to the side, to progress in a new direction. This album is just different. They are doing their thing, and this is an A+, it's a great album, every song. Had this have been their first album, who knows what kind of mad chaos it would have created...maybe the beatles frenzy again? Can never tell..maybe it can still happen? BUY IT!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Purple. <br /> <br />I hadn't planned on writing a review for this fine record. The \\"review\\" farther down changed my opinion. Comparing STP to the Monkees has to be the stupidest comparison I have read yet in a review. STP are musicians in the truest sense. Their performing and songwriting chops are (or were) greater than the vast majority of thier 1990s cohorts. Just listening to them for more than 10 seconds makes that plainly clear. The lower review comes from musical uneducatedness more than anything else. <br /> <br />First, we must get out of the way while STP is lumped in the \\"grunge\\" movement they were not a true band of that genre. The DeLeo Brothers have more at heart and in common with 70s hard rock than Kurt Cobain's shameless ripoff of The Pixies. The first album CORE causes confusion because it sure sounds like grunge. I view that album as a switch and bait. It was very much the \\"big\\" sound at the time. It got STP on the radar to where they could loosen up and throw off the shackles the musically limiting grunge genre. For this the trendy grunge fans bag on STP fiercly for daring to grow beyond grunge. Posuers might be a word they'd use. I'm ok with them doing that, because STP moved beyond grunge for the right reasons. Its a term thrown out because of envy. I like the spirit and integrity of making your own road. <br /> <br />Purple is a very ambitious and deep record. It captures a band at thier creative zenith. There is also something here that I've not noticed in many years from a band - emotion. Not cliched anger, or fury so prevalent in today's \\"alternative\\" corporate crap.  I'm speaking more of sublety, sure there is some in-your-face-ness, but there is also love and even sadness. Which in rock is very difficult to pull off. Anger is easy, but having a wide array of emotion in a release - especially in the 1990s was rare. <br /> <br />Classics abound from Interstate Love Song to Vasoline. My personal favorite though is Kitchenware and Candybars- what a deep emotional cut! <br /> <br />The flow of the album is brillant. As is the song selections. There isn't any filler at all here. Which is a rarity. <br /> <br />If you've only heard CORE, Scott Weiland changes his approach for the better. Weiland loses the overused forced baritone and sings much more naturally with wonderful results. <br /> <br />I could continue to sing the praises of this record. However, you get the point. Many other reviewers agree with me. The ones that don't fit into the aformentioned Grunge crowd who hurl predictable invectives at STP. <br /> <br />If you don't own this record you are missing one of the higher points of 1990s rock. In an era where the diversity, depth and willingness to take you places was all but gone. STP stepped up and delivered an album that 20 years from now will still be considered essentual.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I'm usually a Jack Black fan, but he just doesn't have the acting chops to pull this one off.  Casting him in this movie would be like casting Weird Al Yankovic as the president in Oliver Stone's JFK.  Can you picture Weird Al lifeless on a stretcher evoking our pity?  Black's acting style, his goofy face, all distract from the story.  Peter Jackson may have seemed infallible after the Lord of the Rings, but there is obviously a chink in his armor.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|An ex-girlfriend of mine looks a lot like Chloe Sevigny. So, as I watched the final scene I felt a great deal of sentimental and physical electricity pouring from the television screen. It was quite visceral. But what's especially remarkable is that Chloe allowed Gallo to finish inside of her mouth. Believe me when I tell you, that is a hallmark of a fine woman, who in this film delivered an awesome performance, replete with sounds of ecstacy as she was doing it. Simply divine. The sequence is what the A-B repeat function on your dvd player was MADE for. Now, I know I've avoided the sum of Gallo's work here (other reviewers here have ably handled that); quite simply, Chloe's act is demo material for any woman curious as to what looks hot while getting down. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B000002LIM|5.0|I can't believe I'm writing a review for Danny Elfman's best score and the single, greatest heroic score written for a comic book hero . . .<br /><br />Elfman's orchestral powerhouse begins immediately with the main theme.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|First off, there should be a warning label on this album.  It should read something to the effect of: \\"Die hard korn fans beware: Different sound and direction is on this CD.  Open minded listeners are appreciated.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, this is very different from what we know of korn.  It's closest comparasion would be to Issues (which I did not really care for).  This album is very industrial and is riddled with samples and loops.  I was worried about the one guitar sound but it is pulled off well (and well, you can do MUCH in the studio).  The lyrics are the biggest improvment.  Well thought out and meaningful.  With all these differences this is not to say there are not a few \\"back to basics\\" tunes on here.  Liar and 10 or a 2 way are examples of that. <br /> <br />So yeah, why not make this album?  They just released a greatest hits album and their co-founding guitarist left.  Why not take a chance and experiment?  Great work and and a great buy for the open minded music fan.  Thanks for reading.
0684833395|4.0|Like the imfamous catch itself, Stephen Heller's masterpiece is \\"beautiful in the intricate simplicty of it moving parts.\\" What is most fascinating about the story is the way in which the complex writing style reflects the round-about logic of Catch-22 and both combine to bring forth Heller's bitter attack on bureacracy and the absurdity of it all.  <br />     The novel itself will make your head spin. It does not neccesarily occur in chronoligcal order, but rather events are revealed to you when Heller deems it fit to present their importance. Reading the first chapters will leave you with more questions than any true understanding of the plot, and going back an re-reading won't help you. Rather, by pressing on with a mingled feeling of hatred and love for the confusion, the reader will, through Heller's round-about writing style, learn the answers to his or her many questions. This level of complexity, while muddling the plot, add depth to the books over-all message in a way that few novels ever achieve. <br />    I highly reccomend this book to the thoughtful, patient and curious reader, but with the warning that it is not for the faint of heart.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Here is why i like the album, None of the Albums resemble each other- the Strokes has come up with three different sounding albums and in this day and age of copy cats and factory bands that is hard to find.  All three of the albums express a certain theme and different instuments make a stand on each.  With Room On Fire being a grand display of guitar solo and melody. On this album i find the lyrics are older and the music, on some tracks, interestingly sounds like some 80's electronica which i enjoy.  The Melodies i enjoy, the ROCK i Love and the softer songs i enjoy.  Great Mix of Music. Good Job Strokes
B00005JN2Z|4.0|A very cool film by Michael Mann.Collateral has action,suspense and very good performances.All in a beautiful location of L.A. that makes this film very cool.    The film starts with a cool cameo by Jason Statham giving Vincent (Tom Cruise) his discs of information for do his job in L.A.Then we see Max (Jamie Foxx) and how the daily life of a cabbie goes.He meets on one of his rides a beautiful attorney Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and gets lucky with getting her phone number.As luck hit him well with Annie.Luck went the other way and brought Vincent to his cab.He has to be hostage to Vincent while he makes his rounds on killings his contacts in one night in L.A..Max has to find his way out of this situation and in the process learn a big lesson life.     Tom Cruise gives a great performance as the bad guy that's a sociopath in the film.This is the first part Tom Cruise has ever gotten that is the villain.But this guy isn't your bad guy you want to hate.Vincent is a cool guy that we kind of like.He likes Jazz,he's smart,he's nice.The character has a backrground.You can see it in the film with Tom Cruise performance.Example when he and Max visit Max's mother were he buys the flowers for her.But the other reason is Michael Mann way of handling his characters.In each of his films you will see the characters fledge out.I mean we can understand their emotions,their actions and intentions.Even the bad guys.Like here with Vincent or in Manhunter with the killer when he is approached by a lady or in Heat with Robert De Niro character.Each character is special and interesting in Michael Mann films.He cares about them and doesn't let story move on without them.There as important as the plot.We cant forget Jamie Foxx performance that got him a Oscar and Golden Globe nomination.Always a comedian Foxx as with other actors.Many directors are afraid to use them.If people will take it the wrong way or not.He got his chance in Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday where from them to now.Then comedian.Now award winning actor on to better and bigger things.Intresting the film was originally going to have in the role of Max Adam Sandler.I don't how the film would work with him.Even though he has proved good in drama parts lately with Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish.    Michael Mann on this film used for the first time a high definition camera.About 85-95% was in high def.He uses high def for the unique look of L.A. at night.This a great L.A. with great locals through out L.A. from palm trees,to ghettos to Korea Town. Plus nobody knows L.A. like Michael Mann.He uses L.A. like it was another character.Everthing beautifully photographed.The film could have easily gone for nomination for cinematography.    I've heard complains about the ending and especially from a friend of mine.She says this film should have ended two minutes earlier.I mean ive seen the film five times.I look at the ending and i say big deal.I don't think if they cut a minute or second of the film that it would have mad a big difference.But the most of complains are for that the ending drags and that carries on like were suppose to feel a big emotion or something like that.Also that it's a hase scene in the end.I think it's a good ending but it also goes on taste and what you prefer.    The DVD has a nice commentary track by Michael Mann which as always and his other commentary track he is very interesting and informative.There are few gaps here and there.But besides that it's a good commentary track.The special features on the second DVD are worth watching.The behind the scenes of the film is about 40 minutes with very interesting facts and information of the film and on production and preperation.The other bonus features are good but too little.One deleted scene.One thing on Tom Cruise that's cool but short and the rehearsing footage of the actors preparing to be set when they had to shoot the film.    This a nice film with a lot emotion as well for the character that we care for.This notclear action,suspense film.Where we just go from here to there without caring for what the characters feel.This film doesn't feel numb it feels real and alive.Michael Mann is one of the best directors out there.And proves once again that he is a great director.This is not one of the best films you will see.But you will have a fun ride and enjoy countless of times.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This is a reasonably good action/adventure film.  The visual effects are outstanding and the sound is good.  It is a must, of course, for Star Wars fans.<br /><br />The main failings are the same as any series when you step back in time.  A lot of footage is used to establish characters that show up later rather than simply using different characters, and the film does not completely mesh with the first one produced (which I guess is now number 4).  The young Luke Skywalker seems to be on intimate terms with droids and others that he seems to meet up with later for the first time (???).  The late C.S. Forester was probably the last writer who stepped back in a character's life (with Horatio Hornblower) and successfully meshed stories.<br /><br />Putting the above points aside, the film would do pretty well standing on its own feet.  We have an evil force trying to use others to do its wishes by promising them great rewards.  We have heroes and heroines saving the day.  We have a living-happy-ever-after type ending.  There seems to be no romantic interest, e.g., Luke is too young, the Jedi Knights appear to be from a monestary, etc.  There is the usual assortment of ETs to add to the entertainment value.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't come from the American culture. But I grew up watching western movies on Sunday mornings. In that sense, \\"the wild west\\" is not an unfamiliar setting for me.  <br /> <br />When I first heard about Firefly, I was suspicious about the universe Whedon created. How believeable is a place where you have spaceships and cowboys or whatever co-existing? However, I could not resist the temptation. Unfortunately, in today's movie and TV landscape original ideas are hard to come by. And Firefly is an original concept. Although the basic premises of the story is really hard to buy (horses and spaceships), the character depth, the pace and freshness of the series is strong enough to keep you pinned to your seat accross the TV. <br /> <br />The visual effects also play a very strong role in making you believe in this universe. I am very pleased to see more and more of real world physics appearing in sci-fi movies and TV series. Explosions in space won't make sounds. And there is none. The camera actions I was so fond of in the new Battlestar Galactica are also seen here which gives more strength to the visual drama of the series. <br /> <br />Going back to the characters, every one of them are well-developed and you like each and every one of them. I could not understand the real power of River until I watched the movie (yes, in some episodes you do see that she has special combat skills but that is just a glimpse compared to the showdown in the movie). Even Jayne gets likable sometimes. The romance between Mal and Inara and Kaylee and Simon gets in the way of the story from time to time, but I guess we need some emotion and I won't complain. I don't know how others felt but for me Shepherd Book is a very important part of the series. He introduces a healthy dose of mystery and well, \\"serenity\\" into the hectic pace of the Firefly. I was shocked to see what Whedon decided to do with him in the movie (don't worry I won't ruin the experience for you, just in case you haven'twatched it). <br /> <br />What is more, you see morality, the concepts of good-bad, right-wrong questioned all the time. In times of hardship, how would a decent man behave? You see some answers that you probably would have given. <br /> <br />As a final point, I should say that I am very glad that I bought the DVD set. I wish there was more of it. I don't know if they will be able to continue the series after Serenity, but I will be here to watch it if you bring it on Mr. Whedon.
0316921173|4.0|David Foster Wallace's USA is \\"A U.S. of modern A. where the State is not a team or a code, but a sort of sloppy intersection of desires and fears, where the only public consensus a boy must surrender to is the acknowledged primacy of straight-line pursuing this flat and short-sighted idea of personal happiness.\\" Shtitt thinks this on page 83.<br /><br />And this sloppy intersection of desires and fears is pretty clearly one of the main themes of the book.<br /><br />I think DFW's belief in our perpetually hanging, bifurcated between desires and fears, is why he chooses such an unsatisfying way to end his book, because his point is not that life is hard and then you get to the conclusion and it's good, it's that life is hard and we all do everything we can to forget that, but ultimately life finds a way of making sure that we remember it's hardness.<br /><br />I'm not positive I believe that's a fair point for him to come to after 1,200 pages.<br />Why write a book in an wryly comic tone, with almost a magical realism type element of zaniness, and then come to a conclusion completely infested with bitterness? Hal's spiraling despondence towards the end, mirror's the book's, and perhaps DFW's. And I quote Hal/DFW on page 900:<br /><br />\\"It now lately sometimes seemed a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or a pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We are all dying to give our lives away to something, maybe.\\"<br /><br />There are undoubtedly great parts to this book, like the history of the videophone on 140-151, or the expository essay on 694-- \\"sentiment equals naivete on this continent\\" -- that mirrors the point of the second essay in \\"A supposedly fun thing I'll never do again,\\" but the beautiful prose is mixed too liberally with such an appalling ugliness that his point, the conclusion; the purpose for such a big, grand book needs to have some hope in it. But it doesn't.<br /><br />We find ourselves in a sloppy intersection of desires and fears. Why? Because we are all dying to give our lives away to something, maybe. Are we in time? Do we make it? Does it work out?<br />And I believe DFW answers this question on page 934 when Gately, drunk on pain, sees a vision of \\"the sad kid holding something terrible up by the hair and making the face of somebody shouting in panic: Too Late.\\"rselves in a sloppy intersection of desires and fears.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna was in an interesting situation to follow-up her last album \\"American Life\\", critics hated the album and even though it debuted at #1 in the US it was a commercial failure. She had to create something as beautiful as \\"Ray Of Light\\" yet at the same time unearth her dance roots from \\"Like A Virgin\\". In 2005 she released \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\", her best album yet. Critics were amazed that she could rise from the ashes and redeem herself from the slump, fans rejoiced at the new 'disco' feel and I listened in awe as I heard one heck of an album.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"American Life\\" was amazing, it was actually my favourite album for a while, but this is just something else. Madonna's latest effort shows courage and determination, she keeps her signature 80's sound while retaining her muscial beauty. The overall sound of this album is amazing, she wanted to create an album with no gaps, ballads, with each song leading into another. That by any standards would be hard, however she accomplishes this feat with ease. There are no gaps between songs which makes it seem like a suite rather than an album, it's perfectly produced by Stuart Price and Madonna herself.<br /><br />Now, with the public disappointment of \\"American Life\\" behind her anyone would think she would get rid of Mirwais Ahmadzai!! She doesn't, he only co-produces one track though. Don't let that deter you. You hardly hear disco anymore today, you hardly hear this type of 80's dance/disco anymore. What you do hear is pop wannabes trying to emulate that style and era of music. This is the real thing, no smoke and mirrors just Madonna.<br /><br />This genre of music isn't the sort of music for deep, complex lyrics, and Madonna knows that obviously. The lyrics are quite good except on \\"I Love New York\\" when things start to borderline on the edge of cringe-worthy. Madonna save this with her illustrious vocals that have a little bit of help with the top-notch production. At times, the vocals get a little too  electronic, sometimes sounding like a robot meets vocal synthesiser.<br /><br />\\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" is overflowing with potential singles. Already released is \\"Hung Up\\", the party anthem of 2005. \\"Hung Up\\" samples ABBA's song \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" and while I'm not that attached to ABBA the sample works wonders here.<br />Other potential singles include:<br />\\"Sorry\\"<br />\\"How High\\"<br />\\"Push\\"<br />\\"Get Together\\"<br /><br />The eccentric Kabbalah side of Madonna still shows on this album, while I don't mind Madonna having a religion I'm just tired of her flaunting it and just being so obsessed with it. What is it with these new age/designer religions like Kabbalah and Tom Cruise's one?? She says that the track \\"Isaac\\" is not a dig at Kabbalah at all, while the Kabbalah's say it is and vice-versa -----, anyway it is a rather Hebrew sounding song, but I'm no religious expert!<br /><br />I love how Madonna is trying to rejuvinate the old-school/disco ways with this album. The songs sound retro yet maintain that 'fresh' appeal. The album is gorgeous, in every aspect, right down to the album art!<br /><br />I've just realised that I haven't mentioned every track on this album in detail, well for this album I don't feel the need to. I feel that if I did I'd just be saying the same thing; great, amazing, out of this world. So, I've just decided to broaden the whole album out and mention certain aspects that I hope you will take away with you.<br /><br />Overall, this album is going to be huge, it has already sold over 5 million copies worldwide!

B000B8QEYC|3.0|I found this CD disappointing -- partly because most of the tracks are dreary and downbeat, and, even worse, they ring annoyingly in my head!  I heard \\"Amarantine\\" once and for days it wouldn't get out of my head -- like a bad advertisement jingle.  Same with \\"Amid the Falling Snow\\", which I would've otherwise liked okay. <br /> <br />Having said that, I do have two favorites on this CD: \\"The River Sings\\" and \\"Long Long Journey\\". (To put my review in perspective, my favorite Enya CD is \\"Memory of Trees\\" with \\"Anywhere Is\\" being my favorite all-time Enya CD, closely followed by \\"China Roses\\".)
0385338686|5.0|I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books since the first Shopaholic one came out, and she's gone and done it again.  Like the Shopaholic series, this book is deeper than most chick-lit titles, questioning what is really important in life.  Is it work?  Is it money?  Is it pleasing your parents and family?  And just how do you strike out on your own and find your own path when you are surrounded by so many other outside influences.  Not everybody could just escape to the country for a few months (that part wasn't completely believable - how did she still make the mortgage payments on her flat, for example, while miles away from everything?  And she used her Amex card to pay for new things when she first arrived in the country - where did the bill go?  Or am I just picking nits???)  but the idea behind it still is great.  With every aspect the lesson is that sometimes, what you think you want isn't really what you want at all, and it can take a major life-changing event to make you realize that.
B000B5QWKG|1.0|The album is excellent, but the Dualdisc format is problematic -- it doesn't play in all CD players, and many folks online have reported that it can't be recorded into iTunes.

0440241588|1.0|This book was terrible. Entertaining at first, but towards the end you just want whatever is going to happen to happen. <br /> <br />Not to ruin the ending for you, but nothing ever happens. <br /> <br />It makes me wonder if Grisham actually wrote this book.
B000002GYW|5.0|I recently bought this CD (again).<br /><br />This is another of those albums that I owned on LP and 8-Trac and Cassette, I wore every one of them out. I remember researching the storyline portrayed in this album in high school and doing an art project with drawings I made using old photo's from a book on gunfighters.<br /><br /> I am a sucker for a good concept album. Wishbone Ash's \\"Argus\\", \\"Captain Beyond\\", are the best Guitar Rock and Heavy Rock concept albums respectively, but when it comes to Country Rock, there simply is not a better album than the Eagles \\"Desperado\\". Kenny Rogers \\"Calico\\" might be a distant second, but a far distant one. It goes to show you though... Where is the creative juice that abounded in Rock and Roll in the early seventies?<br /><br />Has there been a great Concept album since Bob Marley's Survival? But I digress...<br /><br />Desperado is an album that anyone should enjoy on many levels.
B0000508U6|4.0|I've noticed that Coldplay has a talent for putting me to sleep but this albums still seems to have more energy in many of the songs than those that follow.  [Technically thanks to the lack of energy or lyrical depth I would rate this a 3.5 (7/10) but alas no such rating exists...]  \\"Shiver\\", \\"Spies\\", \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Everythings Not Lost\\" all provide enough power to the album as a whole prevent the albums from being a whole-album repeat nap generator.  Not to say it's a bad thing at all that most of the songs relax me off to a doze, really it's quite good because who doesn't need a 40 minute rest every once in a while?  And it always leaves me refreashed and ready to take on my life rather than procastinating and running away from my problems and fears.  Shiver and Spies in particular are very different from they're later works, and better for it.  I really enjoy both in their alternative style (both from what's now classified as \\"classic Coldplay\\" and just about everything else).  Not amazing, not steller but a short break from the hecktic work we all live in that can be used to regain perspective.  Things really aren't that bad after all, now are they?

B000002KB8|4.0|Still love the spooky album cover, and the title track \\"Black Sabbath.\\"   They had that nice dark image in 1970.   And they milked it for 35 years.   But for the benefit of anybody under the age of forty,  Black Sabbath did NOT invent heavy metal.  It was a combination of groups.  The whole image probably took a big step forward a full 2 years before this release.  That's when the loudest band, with the longest hair,  and the biggest amps,  and the name that came from LSD released their debut,  \\"Vincebus Eruptum.\\"   That band was Blue Cheer.  Came out in early 1968.   Before Blue Cheer, there was NOTHING like Blue Cheer.   (Unless you count Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced?\\" in 1967.)   Before Black Sabbath, there was Hendrix, Blue Cheer, Steppenwolf,  Ten Years After,  Jeff Beck Group,  Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Mountain, Uriah Heep, and Iron Butterfly.  Sabbath just took the 'heavy sound with the dark image' and perfected it.  But make no mistake, they did NOT invent it.  Hell, even the Beatles put out \\"Helter Skelter\\" a full 2 years before Sabbath.  And the Stones put out \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" a full 2 years before Sabbath.   I wish the heavy metal books would get it straight.  But this is still a great record.
B000063DI9|5.0|yep, i'll admit it. sure, \\"powerslave\\" and \\"piece of mind\\" are great albums. same with \\"somewhere in time.\\" \\"number of the beast\\" is so-so. but this is iron maidens most mature work they've ever done, period. i love concept albums, and this is one of the best i've heard, opeth's \\"still life\\" being one of the few to out-do it. yes, its not as energetic as some of their previous stuff, but there is not one song of filler on here, which ALL the iron maiden albums had up to this point. i will admit that until \\"brave new world\\"(my second favorite by these guys) had come out, they had really hit rock bottom(\\"fear of the dark\\" is alright). this, ladies and gentlemen, is iron maiden at their peak. don't skip out on it.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|I watched this movie knowing full well that it's on many critics Top Ten Worst Films of 2005 lists. I don't care about that sort of thing, I'll make my own judgment, but I was aware. And guess what?? How right the critics are this time! Wow! I'll say it simply -- this is not a very good movie. The events unfold well enough to give you seriously creepy feelings, but in the end, I wished I hadn't put in nearly 100 minutes of my time watching something that was truly mediocre. <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is dealing with an icky divorce as well as an icky custody battle involving her only child, an adorable little girl named Cecilia. Dahlia and Cecilia move into a new apartment, an inredibly nasty apartment with a terrible leak problem. And this isn't just regular water. It's DARK water. Ooooo!! Spooky! Eventually we learn that the apartment above her own was lived in by a family of three. They, too, had a little girl, right at Cecilia's age. Meanwhile, Cecilia's teacher is concerned because she keeps talking to an imaginary friend named Natasha. You guessed it -- Natasha is also the name of girl who once lived above them. So obviously we have a ghost on our hands. <br /> <br />I don't want to reveal to much, just in case you actually want to see this drek and be surprised for yourself. You won't so much be surprised as you will be bewildered. Why does Dahlia do that?? Come on! Why does she give in?? I realize that you have no clue what I'm talking about, but, well, you'll see eventually. Check this out if your looking to be creeped out. Certainly not as good as The Ring, not quite as \\"okay\\" as The Grudge, but still perhaps worth taking a look at.
0385513755|5.0|I saw a lot of Da Vinci Code programs on the history channel and other stations before I actually picked this book up and read it, so the whole concept of the Grail being Mary Magdalene wasn't that much of a draw for me (in fact with all the hype about the book being focused on this idea I avoided it for the first year and a half till I saw this special illustrated edition at Wal Mart).  I'm a fan of books that involve discovering histories mysteries so I decided to pick it up, along with Angels and Demons special edition.<br /><br />I read Angels and Demons first and loved it.  It was fast paced, clever well developed good guys and gals, shady, mysterious, in between characters,and so bad you wanna choke 'em bad guys surprises keep popping up, a good history lesson on Art, Religon, Architecture, and History all in one deliscious serving.  Add to that if you are not familiar with all the various settings of the novel the pictures keep you up to speed.<br /><br />Moving on to the Da Vinci Code is more of the same (though Angels and Demons is a bit better as a thriller).  These two were the best books I have read in a long time (and I do a lot of reading).  I recomend both of these in the Special Illustrated Editions if you want to dole out the extra cash, you'll find it well worth the cost especially for the Da Vinci Code since the publishers still rake in a great deal of money by not publishing it in a paperback for mass market readers.<br /><br />I read

B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode outdid themselves.  After all that they have been through, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was smitten with this album from the very first notes.  It's dark, sure, but it also gives us a ray of hope.  The theme seems to be, \\"You're not perfect, but that's okay, because we're all a bit broken.  Let's keep striving anyhow.\\"<br /><br />I had the opportunity to see them in concert after this album came out, and hearing the songs performed live made them all the more dear to me.<br /><br />Thank you, DM, for giving the world another wonderful creation.
B0000019HU|3.0|Slint was recommended to me by Amazon because of my love for early 90's, late 80's indie rock bands like Dinosaur JR and the Pixies. My first reference I had to think of was Tortoise. That wasn't weird because when I did some more research I found that one of the members of Slint later joined/formed Tortoise. <br /> <br />They only recorded two full length albums of which this is the last one. It has just 7 songs but they last at least 7 minutes. <br /> <br />What makes this album good? Tempo changes, volume changes, key changes. Musically it is very interesting to listen to, though it might take a few turns in the CD player. <br /> <br />I won't listen to it that often because it is difficult but it still sounds very good for an album that is more than a decade old now.
B00005JOIF|5.0|My wife and I saw Munich without knowing very much about the story.  In fact, we thought the story would center on the tragic events of the Olympics rather than the search for the organizers of the massacre of the Israeli athletes.  We found the film to be a little long but with powerful performances, particularly by Eric Bana.  The story centers on Eric Bana's character Avner, who is given the assignment of leading one of the teams to assassinate the leaders of Black September.  The teams are made up of people who are not members of the Mossad since they can be easily recognized.  Avner is selected because having been born in Germany he can better pose as a European and with his background as Golda Meir's bodyguard his commitment is unquestionable.  Avner must cut himself off from all that he knows, including his pregnant wife.  He is working on his own with money placed in safety deposit boxes.  The members of his team are also non-Mossad members and without field experience.  They are motivated by their desire to avenge the murders of the athletes. Geoffrey Rush has an interesting role as Avner's coolly detached Mossad contact and Daniel Craig (the new James Bond) is one of the team members.       Initially, one wonders how the inexperienced Avner can hope to assassinate all 11 members of Black September.  His information is supplied to him by a shadowy French group header by Michael Lonsdale (who was interesting to see again and was well-cast for the part) who is simply known as Papa. This unnamed group offers information to anyone who is willing to pay but as part of the conditions they will not deal with anyone representing a government.  The condition seemed rather academic since someone like Avner, acting on behalf of a government, can easily work with Papa's group as long as he can reasonably claim his non-association.      At first, I was found the planning and execution of the assassinations fascinating as they groped to find a way to carry out their plans.  Their first target is simply shot on his way home then bombs become the weapon of choice used with unpredictable effect.  Stephen Spielberg given us an unbiased view of these events and presents the Palestinian side particularly through the character Ali, who explains to Avner his cause to take back the land that once belonged to Palestine will eventually succeed but only perhaps in 100 years. Avner believes, at first, that he can simply kill the 11 Black September members age stop killing.  But when others replace those who have been killed he questions what he is doing, particularly as members of his team are killed. This is the question that Stephen Spielberg has posed to all of us: How can the killing go on?  What does it solve?    Munich has been criticized by all sides as being pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian; instead it is a mirror of events that are still played out today.  The conclusion of Munich shows that intractable ideas perpetuate themselves and that those who question why so much bloodshed has to be are left out in the cold, much like Geoffrey Rush's Mossad boss refuses to \\"break bread\\" with Avner.  The greatest flaw of the film is that it is too long. My wife and I were wondering how many assassinations were going to be shown before the story would take a different twist.  One also does not have much empathy with the characters as we ourselves begin the question if they are correct in killing their target or are they merely dupes of the Israeli government.  The film does awaken us to the realities behind the newspaper headlines of the moves and countermoves of people like Avner who can never feel safe and cannot leave behind the killings they have committed.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It's been a while since a debute album has impressed me but this one certainly has, it's one of the best albums of 2005. <br /> <br />The Arcade Fire are from Montreal and before the making of this album several family members of the band died, hence the title 'Funeral' but also the very dark tone of the album. <br /> <br />There is sound everywhere: drums, bass, distorted guitar but also violins that sometimes fill in musical space and sometimes double up with the bass, giving it a very pumping sound. <br /> <br />The singing is very haunting, not neat but fittingly for the songs. 'Rebellion (Lies)' is just one of the many great songs on this album so get it!
0307236722|5.0|I've been a Martha Stewart Fan ever since I was a kid, but this is the FIRST and ONLY Martha Stewart Book that I have ever had! I've seen all of her other books in the school library I've never had the urge to buy those like I had when I saw that this book is release.     I can't put it down since I first read it! The money I saved up for it is absolutely worth it! There are tons of step by step pictures and descriptions which are very much helpful for me, an amateur baker, coz they are very precise and acurate sometimes I don't read the desciption I just look at the step by step photos and I get what the instruction is.     I've been baking for many years I made my first apple pie following the recipe from this book and its good! I also tried the white chocolate chunk buterscotch cookie which was a big hit during my family vacation during the holy week! More power to you Martha!
B000003N8R|5.0|Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called \\"Infinity\\" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens Illinois is a refreshing, enlightening, and at times moving album.  His ability to mix creative song writing with worldly beats develops a wonderful musical scene.  Sufjan has an outstanding musical talent. You should take 10 minutes and read his bio.  The guy can play 25 plus instruments. You can tell through his lyrics and composition that music is his life.  Even more impressive is his talent, placing these different elements together. Sufjan blew me away on the first track.  I knew this album was going to be completely different from anything I had heard before.  <br /> <br />I first came across Sufjan Stevens on the Amazon Editor Choice for 2005.  It's the Editors #1 choice as it should be. I find his music is much like Iron and Wine.  His musical is built around mystical story telling riding on smooth airy beats and instrument accompaniments.  I love to find artist like this.  It reinforces my thought that music is still alive.  We still have talented vibrant singer song writers.  The Music industry in all its attempts has still failed to feed us as consumer's crappy pop radio music. I highly recommend this album if you have taste in music and are opening to musical experiences.
B000002KIE|5.0|this  lp is one of the sex pistols best lps. i owned it when it was first released back in 1991. it beat nirvanas lp called smelling teen spirit in the grammy awards that year. i recommend this lp for anyone who likes rock with a little punk flavor added in to it. long live the queen was the sex pistols best song but it was only a single and not included in this lp of theres. this was there third lp to be released. it is better than there debut lp called simply \\"the sex pistols\\" and there sophomore release called \\"rocket to russia.\\" to johnny rotten is no longer with us. i really feel he was the next great rock icon. kind of like neil diamond is. all i can say is BUY THIS LP AT ONCE!!! it is a rock classic from the early nineties.
B0000057C5|5.0|This band is amazing. They make very catchy industrial metal, whether it is fast  or slow. This was my first Rammstein cd that turned me into a big fan, my mom also became a fan of their's and she doesn't even like this kind of music or understand german. Sometimes the lyrics are bizarre but we see and hear things much more worse on T.V. This album was a little too industrial for me so it took me some time to get used to appreciate it.  The guitar riffs are amazing and they just keep on coming, even if they are very simple and repetitive like on bestrafe mich they're still good to rock out to. Stripped is a good song but the singer's style of singing doesn't work in english. The play on words in their songs like on du hast are very creative, that is if you can understand german. The only bad track is alter mann because it's very slow and boring, but it still has a good riff. I enjoyed the whistling and female singing on engel and spiel mit mir is a very creepy song. Du hast falls a little short on the lyrics but has a great riff. Now go buy this cd and become a fan.
B000002KE2|3.0|Review no. 125. Originally released in 1972, as 'Vol.4' was of course their fourth record. Not quite as earth-shattering as their earlier efforts, like 'Paranoid' or 'Master Of Reality' but still a decent '70's British metal title to own and cherish. Tracks I was somewhat impressed here with were the psychedelic textured \\"Wheels Of Confusion\\", the beautifully done \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\", \\"Supernaut\\" (love it when Ministry covers this tune while out on tour) and the stoner classic \\"Snowblind\\". Check this out.
B000028U0Y|4.0|Out of a bunch of vinyl records that my gradparents had this album and 4 others including Live at San Quintin are the only one I like. It has a few scratches but it's a good album to listen to. Some of the songs I don't care for  but my favorites are 25 minutes left, orange blossom, cocaine blues and folsom prison blues. With the combination of his deep voice and the playing of the instuments you get rock mixed with country. So if you like country with some rock edge then get this cd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think this is my first review...I just had to give my input here, though. <br /> <br />We don't get to go out to see movies in the theater since we have a 7 month old baby girl and three older boys. We had read good reviews of Serenity, and liked the preview of the movie that was on some other DVD we were watching. I asked a friend (no kids) if he had seen Serenity. He was very enthusiastic and recommended watching the whole series first to get a better feel for the movie. <br /> <br />We got Firefly from Amazon...love that free shipping! After watching the first hour I was not sure. By the second hour I was hooked. I really do not like westerns, and this is definitely a sci-fi western...but whatever you label it, it just WORKS. Lots of LOL moments. The characters are very well developed, and the Firefly DVD set left us wanting more. We just watched Serenity last night, and it was a very good addition to the series. It is unfortunate that it did not do better at the box office since that may seal the fate of the series. Of course the 2005 box office was just disappointing in general, but unless the DVD sales are phenomenal, this may be the end for Serenity. <br /> <br />So, we happily did our part, buying Firefly and Serenity for ourselves. We also introduced Serenity to two relatives by giving the DVD set and movie as holiday gifts. Who knows? Maybe the word will spread and Serenity will fly again!
B000005RU2|5.0|The first thing I need to say is that I don't own the cd but the vinyl record, which doesn't include the extra songs or the remastered sound. The record does have a few cracks and pops here and there but it's not that big of a problem. Anyways on to the music. This is Deep Purple at it's best here and this is there only album of their's that you need. The songs do go into long jams but they are energenic and don't get boring. However you shouldn't listen to this album unless you want and have time to listen to these long jams. The music here sounds harder and rocks more than any of there studio recordings. My brother has one of theirs cd's and the songs were shorter but they sounded very weak and boring. So in other words this is a great live album.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.. I think Brad and Angelina work very well together and I was impressed with the script and the plot.. It keeps u guessing and it's very entertaining.. never know what's going to happen, what they are thinking... very creative... Great actors, great film.
0802130208|5.0|Looking for an American Literary Classic? Discard those notions of \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or the like.  This is the greatest book written by an American author, and one of the greatest ever written.  It's on the level of Don Quixote (indeed, the main character, Ignatius, could be compared to Don Quixote), on the level of any great novel ever written.  what makes it so great? The comedy of Ignatius, the philosophical, obese, lazy man who thinks to highly of himself and who any Native New Orleans resident could compare to someone they once met (I was born and raised down there.  I can think of at least 3 people myself.) There's also the tradgedy of poor Mrs Reily, the vagrant Jones who needs to work as a porter to evade jail time, and the depressing Officer Mancuso who is looked down on so by his commanding officer.  There's also the realism of the city, or indeed, the country depicted here: The failing Levy factory, The sleazy Night of Joy bar, and the strange residents of The Big Easy who interact with each other so comically throughout the book.  This blend of such ideals react to make a classic novel.<br /><br />Why must our high school students be forced to deal with the dated ideals of \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", ecspecially when it (and other novels) are passed as comedies? Although Confederacy of Dunces is 40 years old (published around 20 years ago), it still pertains greatly to today's social ideals and is still hilarious.  This is the kind of comedy and realism that should be passed through the teenage mind.<br /><br />Still, it's for everyone.  Yes, It does pertain more to New Orleans residents/natives, but everyone will find parallels with their own lives in this novel.  They will find great amounts of humor through the protagonist and the people he affects.  And they will, indeed, find a great novel that can be treasured for ages.
0307236722|5.0|I just made the Coconut Cake yesterday. It was definitely worth the effort of around 5 hours (my first attempt at cake) for a cake so rich tasting and infused with creamy coconut flavour. A note about this recipe: when making Coconut Curls to garnish, don't forget to bake your coconut before cracking it open - I missed this step and ended up with raw, tough and fibrous curls.  <br /> <br />This book has high resolution close-ups of the end result of each recipe and is beautifully organized. I especially appreciate the page about required equipment at the beginning of each of the sections (cake, cookies, etc) with pictures of all the tools. Recipes are as straight-forward as possible, with no unnecessary information and are therefore fool-proof. Be aware that the recipes are written assuming that you are using a stand mixer to mix everything. I made Seven-Minute Frosting yesterday but using my hand mixer with 1 of the 2 beaters missing, it took an HOUR for the egg whites to get to frosting state. Whether you are a beginning or experienced baker, do not hesitate to get this book (if not just for the pictures! Yum)!
B000007T1M|5.0|Who thought this was Nu-Metal??? This is progressive HEAVY A*S METAL. If you haven't gotten in on this band(anyone left?) Start here and buy everything you can find from them. They are THE SH*T!!!
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|This is definitely a new sound, and definitely NOT an improvement. Don't assume that if you liked the first two albums you'll like this one as well. It does have a couple of fun tracks.
0060012234|5.0|Brent Hartinger's young adult novel Geography Club deserves praise for its emotionally-moving portrayal of high school life for several young gay people. Hartinger is by no means the first author to tackle the topic of gay teenagers, but he is one of the first authors I've read who comes close to capturing the complexity of the issue.    The novel is character-driven more so than it is plot-driven, and therein lies its strength. Russel and his friends Min and Gunnar are compelling and three-dimensional (though admittedly, some of the secondary characters seem like walking stereotypes out of a high school comedy). Hartinger doesn't \\"talk down\\" to readers and doesn't offer any easy answers. In that sense, the novel reminds me of S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|The planted good reviews makes this all the more pathetic. I've listened to all three Strokes albums and numerous ep's and singles. I live in New York and I've hung out at parties with these guys. They are nice enough but the music is just not good. Bad melodies (if you want to call them that). Singing, well downright bad. The comparison to Velvet Underground are pretty dead on for me because I recently re-listened to the VU's \\"breakthrough\\" album and it's just as bad if not even worse. My \\"First Impression\\" is that these guys just aren't any good. The noise, the noodling, yelling and yelping does not a good song make. Luckily these guys don't have to give up their day jobs. Just stop it already, go have a drink at Niagra and keep pretending to be a \\"band\\". Just like the unemployed - It's not working. <br /> <br />
B00004ZD69|5.0|As any diehard Pink Floyd will know, the atmosphere of their works like \\"Meddle\\", \\"DSotM\\" and \\"WYWH\\" is what we listen to their music for. Their song 'careful with that axe, eugene' is probably their best one because of the landscape it creates. Now I'm admitting right here that the fact that they had to actually make them 'songs' with a distinct chorus, solo, etc. almost burdens the direction of the music. <br /> <br />At the end of a Pink Floyd album, I find myself unrested, unsettled, as if I just got a peek at something greater that I want to see more of. <br /> <br />That's where Godspeed You! Black Emperor comes in. <br /> <br />This may not be the best way to describe it for everybody, but their music, for me, lets me immerse youself in the search for God. I almost think of myself as sort of a detective, following God through parks, across the lakes, flying across hills, looking at him through a window, sliding into the fingertips of dancing children, to the bedsides of dying men, watching each encounter for only a moment, and then abruptly being thrown out of one scene and into another. <br /> <br />Let's face it. As much as I wish it wasn't true, no music can help you to understand God. At all. I'm not normally that religious. I find myself disgruntled with the way it's handled, packaged and sold. I mean, just look at Christian music. I don't want something supposedly almighty and all encompassing to be put in simple terms. The holiness of a God cannot afford to be soiled and compensated just so the general public can understand it. Those songs sound like they were all assembled with the 200 word \\"Christian Magnetic Poetry Kit\\". But this album doesn't try to explain God to you. They just show you that he is there somewhere. <br /> <br />I certiantly do believe in God, and this is the album that teaches me that it's alright to not understand everything, or even agree with the way any of it is being handled. I can just lay down, put this album on and Lift MySkinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven. <br /> <br />
B00005T7I1|4.0|This is truly a work of genius, especially on the part of Al Pacino.  Al Pacino totally transforms himself into the conflicted, not so conflicted criminal, Big Boy Caprice, who plots to run the city.  His performance, which was undoubtedly a lot of fun, exceeds almost anything that he has done.  He really should have won an Oscar for this heartfelt portrayal of a comic book character brought to life on the big screen.    Though some of Madonna's acting was a little hammy, it fits well with the general theme of the movie.  The lines, looks, poses and especially Madonna's singing were truly galactic, in stature as well as proportion, and establishes her firmly on the realm of awesome talent.    The rest of the players, actors and artist in this flick were also \\"top drawer\\", and are by no means secondary in terms of ability or contribution to this wonderful flick. Whether by the vivid colors, the thirties cityscapes or the harbor, with the looming ocean liners, which were state of the are travel of that day, and look the part here. The director, Warren Betty, did an outstanding job of bringing thirties comic book texture, simplicity, innocence and complexity to life in what is an artistic blockbuster.  I am glad that I rediscovered this treasure!
B000002L9Y|5.0|This beautiful piece, released in 1987, is a perfect proof of the evolution of each of Fleetwood Mac`s members. Lindsey and Christine are everywhere and it sounds perfect. Mick and John still working hard to give a pop and blues atmosphere for the incredible voices of Stevie and Lindsey. <br />After many solo albums of the American couple, Fleetwood Mac comes back with a different style, with a different touch, which is softly evident in tracks like \\"Welcome to the Room... Sara\\", \\"You and I\\", or \\"little Lies\\". <br />Cheerfully, the group still has a distinctive ace in the hold, a mix of pop and rock-blues, which had already made them famous. Tracks like \\"Family Man\\", \\"Caroline\\", \\"Isn`t it midnight\\", will show make you live a new experience.  <br />Enjoy this album as much as I did. I`m recommending it fro you!.
B00005MP58|4.0|My daughter and I were anxious to watch this together, because we love period films. I gave this to her for a Christmas gift, and we watched it over two nights. The story was wonderful, but I agree with a previous reviewer about the quality of the dvd being poor, the sound was not great and the picture looked grainy in parts. All this being said, it WAS worth purchasing and we enjoyed it a lot. Colin Firth was great!
0061015725|3.0|I listened to this on a cross country flight.  I enjoyed it, but overall I find much of it mis-informed, bad science, and inconsistent even with the authors asumptions.  The characters often seem to behave stupidly.  Crichton tries to explain that which he of course can not and just gets himself deeper into stupid explainations.  Note that I am NOT saying nanotechnology does not have any dangers, or that evoloving replicating nanobots are not possilbe or that emergent behavior does not exist. So enjoy the read, or listen, but don't think about it too much and don't take the narators explainations as factual (this is FICTION after all).  (I don't want to discuss inconsistences etc here since such would be spoilers).
B000065VB0|5.0|This CD is by far the most creative and original music by Mr. Gabriel.  Wild and weird, lots of great background sounds and fantastic guitar work.  A must have!!!
B000A59PMO|4.0|I had heard all the reviews and it wasn't until Joss Whedon started praising this show that I decided to buy the DVD and give it a try myself. I had heard the comparisons to Buffy, Alias and Nancey Drew, which are right on, but this show is so much more. You have great scripts with witty dialogue, a central mystery(that isn't drawn out like Lost), great looking people to look at every week and most of of Kristen Bell who is wonderful in this.<br /><br />I look forward to Season 2 and hopefully it will have more extras which is the reason why I took one star away.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Many people will complain that this version isn't good because Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford didn't perform as the Phantom and Christine. Well, I'm a phanatic. I own 6 books, 5 movies, and 11 soundtracks, and this is one of the best versions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical that I've heard. No, it cannot compare to the live Broadway show, but it is definately one of the most emotional, most in-depth, best adaptation that I've seen. Gerard James Butler, Emmanuelle Grey Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all did an amazing job with the music. I'm proud to be the generation this was made for. @-P---
B000000OA6|5.0|We the fans new something was up after Queen failed to tour <br />for The Miracle...  Nevermind that Freddie didn't quite look <br />himself for the Miracle videos The Miracle and I Want it All, <br />we were all holding our collective breath....and then <br />Innuendo was released...simoltaneiously were were happy and <br />sad....our hero, Freddie, was dying and his farewell was <br />this record...and what a record it is.... <br /> <br />This is a clasic mix of hard rock, pop ballads, classic Queen, <br />and even a dash of Zeppelin...well produced, great mix, <br />and stellar packaging....probably the strongest release in <br />a long time.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Alot of negitive comments have been made about this album just cause its different. Well shut up! This album rocks as much as the other but with more of a hip hop beat and style but songs like \\"polotics\\" is just typical Korn which we all love. Songs you should check out: \\"twisted transistor\\" \\"polotics\\" \\"hypocrites\\" \\"liar\\" souvineir\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|I adored the latest \\"Keira Knightley\\" version of Pride & Prejudice and was inspired to rent the A&E version with Colin Firth.  Well, although the A&E series is quite long, it is definitely the very best version. I've even seen the old version with Sir Laurence Olivier and neither can compare to the A&E version despite their merit.  Simply the most romantic and beautiful series I've ever seen!  <br /> <br />The acting and direction in this version is outstanding - both Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle can't be beat in both their portrayals of the characters and general good looks.  The screen play was most like the book and the scenes contained beautiful scenery and lovely music.  When I read the book, I could only imagine Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />I did not purchase this DVD but rented it at my local video store, therefore I can't judge the sound or visual quality of the DVD.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This is the best live album since Disasterpieces. Corey's voice is strong and powerfull.Mick and james' guitars are excellent. sid can be heard threw out the whole album.133 is also heard more especially in \\"eyeless\\". Paul is great especially in \\"Iowa\\". Joey proves that he is the best drummer in the world again. Chris and Clown's precussion adds a hell of alot of beat and their back up vocals kick ass! There are songs on the album that you world'nt expect to be on it but still rock as hard as the rest eg. \\"everything ends\\" \\"get this\\" \\"Iowa\\" <br />Overall this album proves one thing for sure... <br />THAT SLIPKNOT RULE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000OE7|5.0|I was very fortunate to have seen Queen live on two different occasions. As if by gift from the gods themselves, they were the opening act for the then new Charleston Coliseum (WV) on the tour for \\"The Game\\" album in 1980. I saw them again in Cincinnati for the \\"Hot Space\\" tour. They were the best concert I had ever seen, and I had seen them all. Freddie Mercury is a legend and this album is a great, and sometimes melancholy final release from this genius with which we once shared the planet. When it was first released I was afraid of something that might taint the perfectionistic ideals that were so much a part of Queen. In reality it only heightens them. The title track is a beautiful instant classic that is awe-inspiring. \\"Let Me Live\\" is a very touching and powerful song with Freddie's vocals as impressive as ever. A personal favorite of mine on this album is \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\", classic pop with a positive message of Freddie's peace with god before his death. \\"Mother Love\\" is a magically brooding song that gets you in the heart. I can only dream about the creation that was still possible from Freddie Mercury. I think that he and the rest of Queen will be remembered as the greatest musicians of all time.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|For those of you who listen to the samples offered on Amazon of each song, know that they are a poor representation and do not do justice to this CD.  <br /> <br />I was VERY hesitant to get the CD after listening to the samples. However, I decided to take the plunge nonetheless, having enjoyed 'Hung Up' thoroughly. <br /> <br />As someone who loves to dance and cannot keep still when listening to music, this is great!  <br /> <br />It reminds me a great deal of 'Ray of Light' and seems to sample quite a bit from that album as well, which I loved. <br /> <br />If you like to dance, be aware this is more like the 'pop' Pharell Williams helps people with, than the pop of early Britney Spears. The hooks are very catchy. <br /> <br />I did not enjoy 'I love New York'. 'Isaac' is a double-edge sword for me--I am not Jewish, but can understand why someone who is would take offence to it; I personally object to the use of sacred chants in popular music, as I find it blasphemous. However, to the song's credit, the rest of it is quite good and the lyrics reminded me of 'Frozen' from \\"RoL\\", which, again, i loved--bittersweet and aching, melancholy to a degree, as well as sort of devotional (more like 'Like a Prayer\\" in that regard). <br /> <br />All in all, this CD cements/reinforced why Madonna is called 'her Madgesty'--she is the undisputable queen of the dance floor.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is the only John Mayer album I own.  Im not really into modern pop music.  I consider myself a pretty good collector of music, I have many cd's of the Beatles, Henrix, Doors, SRV etc.  John Mayer is obviously not a SRV or Hendrix, and compaing him to them is just stupid.  However, Mayer does have awesome guitar skills, and his voice isnt the greatest voice, but its unique, and it works with his guitar licks.  Look at Hendrix, he never had a good voice, neither did Joplin or even Bob Dylan.  Their uniqueness makes their music even better.  With this album Im glad to add John Mayer with both Jack White (White Stripes) and Henry Garza (Los Lonely Boys) as one of the best guitarists of our own modern time.
B00008OLIC|5.0|This album was recorded with Bob Rock and when the band was sober, and that really comes through in all the songs. Vince, Tommy, Nikki and Mick are all on top of the game. These guys really made a great record. I think in The Dirt, Tommy says that every song ended up as a single. When this album came out, it was #1!! This c.d. is awesome, and if you are a Motley Crue fan, and are sane, you will buy it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|A four star review coming from a straight rap fan (well, not today's rap). I thought that Linkin' Park did very well, for an album on their own (I got started on this when they teamed up with Jay-Z for Collision Course). Songs like Don't Stay & Faint, are straight rockers to me, and Somewhere I Belong & Numb tell a good story. Lying From You sounds great too. Breaking the Habit is a wonderful song, and if it actually took them so long to produce, it was worth the wait. I'd of course like Nobody's Listening, because I am a hip-hop fan (That Japanese Flute is wonderful). Session shows me that even their DJ has skills. My favorite is Numb, because the concept I can apply to a lot of things. It's a shame that 2 years ago when this came out, I didn't get it, only because of what I thought they were. Well, it is totall different. It's a nice CD, and well worth the money.
B000002HRE|5.0|Why people say that this was a bad c.d. is waaaaaaaay beyond me. Sure, it's a bit different then the Black Album but it still kicks A$$!!! The songs 'Fuel' and 'The Memory Remains' are the greatest. The whole record is AWESOME!!!!! It was totally worth the money that I paid for it. If you are even just thinking about getting this cd, do it. It is worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Yes, this movie was pretty good.  The action is a little generic - particularly the sexy little girl warrior that kicks guys' butts and the heavy conspiracy government cover-up plot.  And the bad guys, alas, are basically rejects from Buffy.  But there's a reason Whedon is popular, he can certainly write, it's cool dialogue and action and his hero is someone Han Solo would hang out with. <br /> <br />The movie IS fun, original, thought-provoking.  But the last is a problem - because Whedon can't seem to write his big ideas clearly, so I was left scratching my head aftewards wondering if he's religous, or anachist or liberal or what.  It's just. this. short. of making it's point clearly.  The fans obviously get it - read the other reviews.  And I suspect current college students are already immersed in Josh's culture enough to 'GET' it. <br /> <br />The rest of us will have to be happy with the movie George Lucas should have given us years ago.  My personal preference is that Josh makes more movies like this, with a smidge more fun, a little more explanation, and a little more spit and polish - and help me forget Episode I-III.
B000062YB1|4.0|this was my 1st Slayer album at 1st i saw it as a masterpeice but after hearing Reign In Blood i have changed my mind. This is an awesome album. And als an essential album for any metal fan. There really isnt much to say that hasnt already been said here. <br />
B000006P8I|4.0|I don't have this exact album but have another with about 3/4 of these tunes plus 4 others from this period.  <br /> <br />Bowie's material from this period could perhaps only be appreciated by people who enjoy trippy psychedelic pop in the vain of Syd-Barett-period-Pink-Floyd (\\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\") or The Beatles (ala \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" etc.) <br /> <br />It is fun, it has humour, it has fantasy, it has some great story-based trippy lyrics... a little bit like mid-late 60s John Lennon and Syd Barret. <br /> <br />This is music to make you smile and recall childhood days of fantasy and wonder. In essence, this music is right on the mark for the time it was created. <br /> <br />Sadly, this particular album does not have \\"The Laughing Gnome\\", which never fails to bring a big grin to people's faces. <br /> <br />I love and appreciate Bowie's work from all of his phases - except for the \\"Space Oddity\\" album which, apart from that great title track, is truly bland. <br /> <br />However, if you're limited in interest to his moody late 70s stuff, or his heavier stuff from the late 90s, or his 80s pop, or his glam stuff from the early 70s, then this possibly isn't for you. <br /> <br />But if you like trippy 60s pop that will make you smile and daydream - then a lot of Bowie's work from this period is excellent! <br /> <br />My wife and I view this album as therapy - if we're feeling down or moody these charming happy go lucky tunes snap us out of it and put a smile on our faces ;-) <br /> <br />How could you not feel better after hearing a song like \\"Rubber Band\\"? <br /> <br />So, if not this album, then maybe go for the Deram collection that other reviewers mention. <br /> <br />PS - what also amazed me when I heard Bowie's late 60s works, is that the clarity of the music and his vocal performance far outshines his later, famous early 70s works. They sound muddy and cluttered in comparison.
B000BNI90O|5.0|The other reviews (well, the positive ones anyways), sum up how great this \\"complete recordings\\" set is more than I could. I would like to add some technical details about the DVD Audio disc for those curious.  <br /> <br />First, note that the DVD Audio disc contains the *entire* three hour recordings (so no disc swapping as with the CDs). Further, it's available in up to *four* different formats (which you use will depend largely on your audio setup). They are-- <br /> <br />* Dolby Digital 5.1 [DVD Video (compatibility)] at 448 Kbps <br />* Dolby Digital 2.0 [DVD Video (compatibility)] at 224 Kbps <br />* Advanced Resolution Surround Sound (48 kHz, 24-bit) [DVD Audio] <br />* Advanced Resolution Stereo Sound (48 kHz, 24-bit) [DVD Audio] <br /> <br />With regard to the DVD Audio tracks, I was a little disappointed in the only marginal increase in sample rate over standard CD audio (I was hoping for at least 96 kHz, at least for the stereo tracks), but the increase in sample size (16-bit for CD vs. 24-bit on this DVD Audio disc) was *most* welcome. On a positive note, by keeping the sample rate down to 48 kHz they managed to keep the whole score on one DVD (a higher sample rate would likely have meant splitting the content between two or more discs).  <br /> <br />Finally, to give you an idea of how the space on this DVD Audio disc was used, here's the size of the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS directories (and their percentage relative to the total size of the disc)- <br /> <br />\VIDEO_TS - 0.94 GiB (14%) <br />\AUDEO_TS - 6.00 GiB (86%) <br />Total - 6.9 GiB (100%) <br /> <br />The AUDIO_TS directory contains the DVD Audio portion of the disc (Advanced Resolution tracks above). The VIDEO_TS directory contains the DVD Video (compatibility) portion of the disc (Dolby Digital tracks above). <br /> <br />As a parting note, yes, this is more expensive than I would have thought. But it is worth it, especially if you love Howard Shore's score for the film (and even more especially if you enjoy higher quality audio as is available on the DVD Audio disc included in the package). Now the wait for the next two films to be given the \\"Complete Recordings\\" treatment.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|All I can say is.... absolutely brilliant!
0688101364|5.0|I bought this book for myself this Christmas baking season and I am soooo glad I did. What a beautiful book. I made 4 types of cookies out of it this year and each of them were fantastic! I absolutely LOVE the lemon bars. And although other reviewers have said that the Magohany Buttercrunch didn't come out for them, I had no problems with it at all. Delicious! Aside from the tasty recipes, this book is very well written and organized and contains a wealth of information about cookie baking. Here is what you can expect to find with every recipe:<br /><br />1)A beautiful picture accompanying it, so there is no question what the finished product is supposed to look like.<br /><br />2)A detailed ingredient list, broken down in volume, ounces and grams, making it user friendly for every baker.<br /><br />3)A detailed equipment list outlining exactly what you will need in order to make each recipe. This is a very nice feature, given that many recipes have the equipment needed buried inside the recipe descriptions. Nothing worse than being in the middle of a recipe and realizing you don't have that candy thermometer that you need!<br /><br />4)Several different mixing methods when appropriate (ie/food processor method, electric mixer method or by hand). It's great to be able to choose the method!<br /><br />5)Storage and longevity information about every recipe. Detailed information about how each cookie can be stored (if they can be frozen and/or if they can be kept at room temp or need to be refrigerated) and how long the cookies will keep with each storing method. This is VERY valuable information.<br /><br />6)A \\"Smart Cookie\\" section providing hints and useful information about every recipe.<br /><br />7)A personal introduction from the author about every recipe, giving a detailed description of the cookie, what you can expect if you make it and what the recipe means to the author (whether it was a cherished childhood recipe, a recipe shared by a friend or one that she tweaked herself to arrive at the best version, etc).

B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is an amazing album by Death Cab For Cutie. I actually got it as a present from my friend, who knew I had loved all other DCfC cd's, and when this one came out, I couldn't wait to get it. <br />Plans is the greatest CD I have ever listened to. Every song speaks to me, about my life, friends, and love. My two favorite songs, 'Crooked Teeth' and 'Marching Bands of Manhattan' are wonderful. <br />'Crooked Teeth' starts out very nicely, I love how I am able to relate to these songs. I can tell that Ben Gibbard has had a life much simmilar to what mine has been like up to this point. Everytime I hear \\"No, you can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along\\" I am forced to smile, because of how simple that statment is, but I never really thought about it, it makes me laugh. <br />'Marching Bands of Manhattan' is obviously talking about love. Ben is showing compassion, and I can't help but sing along. He says that if he 'could open his arms, and span the length of the isle of Manhattan I would bring it to where you are' which is a sign that he would do anything for his love, also including 'if he could open his mouth, wide enough for a marching band to march out, they would make your name sing' which made a shiver the first time, and many following times, I listened to that song. <br /> <br />I truley believe, that if you like DCfC, even just a little bit, you should purchase this cd. You won't regret it.
B00006LLNV|5.0|Elliot Goldenthal captured the color of Mexico, the laughter of the Mexicans, the smell of its rich cuisine and the anguish of Frida Kahlo in each one of the arrangements to the songs in this CD. With Lila Downs and several other folk music singer/performers adding to the beauty of this album comes the powerful voice of Chavela Vargas, perhaps the best performer of Mexican songs ever. Her version of \\"La LLorona\\" and \\"Paloma Negra\\" are mind-blowing, superb, and ultimately beautiful. Her raspy voice together with Lila's vocal power make for an excellent album that Mexican folk music fans must have. Salma Hayek's performance of \\"La Bruja\\" is not bad either. The CD is entertaining, and perfect for a soire with wine and of course, Frida Kahlo's art.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|If youre a fan from this great group, you might have been following them since Is This It (consider a part of the best rock albums in history!) and passing through Room On Fire. And you will be happily surprised with this new album. If youre not a \\"stroker\\" well this might make you one. <br /> <br />It starts with a great song \\"You Only Live Once\\" its just got a great rythm and a nice clear voice from Juls. A brilliant song musically. Then comes Juicebox with that raw kind Stooges sound. A great strong hard rock track. Heart In A Cage does sound like a heavymetal song but with a Strokes thing to it, youll love the guitars in it. Razor Blade, a song with a Manilow's Mandy melody to it, its just a great song for both rock guys and pop girls. The Other Sides is a reggae dance song effuse with great lyrics. Vision of Division is a punk rocker track with a guitar solo that sounds middle eastern and has great guitar riffs, youll bang your head in no time. Ask Me Anything is the Strokes experimeting. A background of a mellotron riff, actually a computer, and Juls singing non-sequitur lines. Dont be a coconut and youll like it. Next comes the broadway-esque Electricityscape. With nice sentimental vocals \\"when youre closer now,i know you belong on the radio\\". Killing Lies is one of the ballads in the album with almost tribal drumming. Which sets a nice rythm for the song. And in this one we get those slurred vocals we knew and love. Fear of Sleep is an ode to insomnia. It does give a feel of falling asleep, fun and relaxing, at least some of it. Youll now when u hear it ;) 15 Minutes, starts as a ballad but near the end explodes along with the vocals. Fun fun song. Ize of the World has a new wave / metallic sound. And a chourus where all phrases end in -ize, thus the title. And the ending will surpirse you. The last 2 song are more mellodic and soft. Giving the listener a break after the past songs. Evening Sun is totally soothing filled with atmospheric guitars. Relaaax. Red Light is a fun song with a sorta childish sound to it. Giving the album a \\"nice\\" ending.
B00065MDRW|5.0|King Crimson's debut album sets an impossibly high standard for the potential of popular music. Fully embracing elements of jazz and classical styles, the band creates an album of breathtaking ambition and quality. In uniting concept, artwork, instrumentation, lyrics and composition, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" rivals The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" as the most creative album in rock and roll history. <br /> <br />The brilliance of the album begins not with opener \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" but with the horrifying cover, recalling the terror, if not the style, found in an Hieronymous Bosch painting. This sets the tone for the apocalyptic visions that follow. The opening cut begins with assorted white noise, before a muted metal riff kicks the song into high gear. Greg Lake's distorted vocals spout two verses of psychotic poetry before the band kicks into a jazzy midsection, as a mind-blowing storm of guitars, saxophone, and drums races through multiple time signatures and textures. The technical brilliance of the playing is rivaled only by the clarity of the production.  <br /> <br />The next song, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" has an almost folk-like quality, as atmospheric and gentle flutes and clarinets play over Michael Giles's tasty drum fills. The songs false ending gives way to a well-improvised flute solo, the \\"wind's\\" response to the speech. Before the solo has concluded, timpani rolls introduce the brooding epic \\"Epitaph.\\" The sounds on this track are rich and full enough to fill a canyon. Mellotron and synthesizers give texture to fine acoustic guitar work and the slow and steady march of percussion. The music perfectly matches the despair of the lyrics, which are good enough to pass as the lost work of W.B. Yeats. Greg Lake earnestly sings, \\"The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams/Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams/When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams/Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Moonchild\\" begins as an equally promising track, similar to \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" with vocal production that gives a truly intimate sound. Unfortunately, the song descends into an extended improvisation piece which consists of a long series of brief riffs on various instruments. Though pleasant, it never develops into a truly cohesive whole, and as the song is 12 minutes long, this becomes a bit tedious.  <br /> <br />Finely orchestrated, final cut \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" synthesizes the successes of earlier cuts to create an imaginative fantasy epic. The excessive mellotron may sound dated in 2006, but if the track fails, it does so in full grandeur, in pursuit of epic timelessness. The track concludes a stunning album, which truly blurs the line between popular and high art. The members of the first King Crimson lineup were musicians, not rock stars, and their work reflects a perfectionism and creativity rarely found in popular music. <br />
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I was sick at home from work last summer. The Sci Fi channel was running their typical weekday marathons. I decided what did I have to lose. I watched most of the episodes of \\"Firefly\\" in one day. I don't know how much of the series I missed, but I enjoyed the witty mix of genres of Western and Sci Fi adventure. Therefore, I really wanted to see this movie and it did not disappoint me. This movie is one of the best movies developed from a TV series I have ever seen. The movie can be enjoyed without seeing the series, but the film does a great job of explaining the background of the series and tying up plot lines.  <br /> <br />The dialog is witty. The plot is not overly original, but in this day of rehashed plots from comic books and older movies, it is more original than most. I wish I saw this on the big screen, but it plays fine on DVD. The relationships of the crew members is funny and touching. Some of the captain's conversations about leadership and what it takes to be a ship captain waxes poetic, but in a very good way. The movie is not perfect, but it is the most entertaining Sci Fi movie to come out in several years.   <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book was truly insprirational and rivoting! James becomes your friend while he takes you along with him on the ride that changed his life. He puts feelings, emotions, and terror into works unlike any book I have ever read.  From the minute I began reading I was instantly absorbed!  I actually miss him now that the book is over.  I commend his braveness and courage, and think James is truly a remarkable human being!!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I never liked disco music during its heyday, but Madonna has given disco new life with her retro beat and techno sound in \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\"  Her distinctive voice - strong yet somehow breathless - melds well with the synthetic music to give even the weakest tracks the seamless sound of a veteran musician.  Although \\"Hung Up\\" gets the most airtime for its steady and catchy beat, it's not the only song to admire here.  The haunting \\"Forbidden Love,\\" with its synthesized voices, is a wonderful break from the revved up songs that surround it.  \\"How High\\" starts as pure techno, but  Madonna's trademark seductive voice rescues it from a potentially generic sound.  \\"Sorry\\" is another one of my favorites, as it builds to a great beat and more complex music than many of the other tracks.  As the title implies, this CD is not about lyrics but about dancing and catching the momentum of each song in your arms and legs.  You'll find your head bobbing to these tracks wherever you are.  For those of us who no longer frequent the clubs, Madonna allows us the joy of pretending that we still can. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Fearful, combative and despondent. Cocksure New Yorkers The Strokes weren't big purveyors of these three themes on their first two albums Is This It and Room On Fire, but third release First Impressions Of Earth unveils a band unsure of their current position in the alternative rock sphere. Musically referencing everyone from Bach to Barry Manilow, First Impressions Of Earth also finds frontman Julian Casablancas sounding shellshocked and desperate. At times psychological traumatised (`Help me, I'm not quite myself', Casablancas slurs on the urgent Heart In A Cage), doubting (`I got nothing to say' he intones on Ask Me Anything) and drunkenly contemplative (the lurching 15 Minutes is a ringer for legendary Irish group The Pogues), First Impressions Of Earth marks the point in The Strokes career where the lyrics move from downbeat to beaten down. Musically, the third record also deviates from the narrow terrain of previous releases by taking in a variety of new sonic textures. The rumble of Juicebox harks back to 1960s television themes for The Munsters and Batman, the furious guitar on Vision Of Division resembles Bach's Toccata And Fugue In D Minor and Ask Me Anything has no instrumentation save for Nick Valensi's ominous mellotron. At times it's hard to tell if Julian is singing with his tongue in cheek or a gun to his head, but it's engaging to hear the vocalist wrestle with his demons while his band kick out against the sceptics. First impressions? The world is theirs to conquer again.

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Some year, 1971.  The year of the bad rock-star beard.  George Harrison had one.  Leon Russell had one too, not to mention miles of split ends.  Leon!  What were you thinking?<br /><br />It's all evident in the Concert for Bangladesh movie.  But that's not what I'm here to discuss.<br /><br />I first saw it when it was released in the theaters in 1972, that's how old I am.  I still have the original vinyl album and the great booklet with all the pictures.<br /><br />I remember one summer the movie played at the local drive-in and I went with a bunch of buddies, crowded into a lime-green Volkswagen Beetle. When Bob Dylan came on, everyone honked their horns and flashed their lights.  It was a cool moment.  Of course, one of my cynical friends had to complain.  \\"Look at Dylan! He's a has-been!  He's OLD!\\"  What was he, like thirty?  I guess that was old back then, wasn't it.<br /><br />Looking at the film on DVD all these years later, I'm struck by just how much sprituality was in evidence at that show.  Harrison was so earnest in his beliefs and it really rang true.  It still makes sense to me today.  He never sang about subscribing to a certain religion, but simply what you can find inside yourself.  You know, The Inner Light and all that.<br /><br />There was such a heartfelt camaraderie on the stage that night.  Ringo Starr looked great behind the skins, alongside future Wilbury Jim Keltner.  When those shimmering first chords of It Don't Come Easy come up, so do my goose-bumps. You have to put this in perspective;  The Beatles had only broken up a year or so earlier, and these guys were still infallible gods at the time. Not only that, to see Bob Dylan in person was an event; he'd been in exile for several years at this point.  When the spotlight hit Harrison for the first time, he was greeted with an extended standing ovation.  It was as though the audience just wanted to thank him for all those years as a Beatle.  Well, I guess that's what they were doing.<br /><br />Honorable mention goes to Billy Preston, who delivered a stirring rendition of That's the Way God Planned It, a song that could thaw even the coldest of atheist hearts.  The moment he loses control and dances all around the stage is a moment for the ages.  Eric Clapton, unfortunately and shamefully, was pretty strung out at the time.  It didn't even look like him, and there was certainly no fire in his playing; he just sort of stumbled about. Thank goodness he managed to yank himself out of that deadly haze before he wound up on the cover of Rolling Stone for the wrong reason.<br /><br />At the Concert for Bangladesh, George Harrison pulled it off.  He came out from behind the shadow of Lennon/McCartney, proving himself as an artist to be reckoned with.  He also proved himself to be a great humanitarian.<br /><br />1971 may have been the year of the bad rock-star beard, but it was a good one for the world.n, who delivered a stirring rendition of That's the Way God Planned It, a song that could thaw even the coldest of atheist hearts.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|I heard the single a few weeks ago on Sirius and I was hyped, the instruments sounded better and Julian sounded he had a fire in his belly.  This was the album to make or break them in my opinion. I got it today and it just seems to me that the singer is not on the same page with the band.  The rest of the group play their parts very well and bring life to the album but Julian does his best to bring the atmospehere down.  Too bad because alot of these songs do sound good and it's worthy of decent review but Julian's lack of enthusiasm and singing bring this down 2 stars.  He sounds as if he's just gotten out bed and kranky to boot.  He sounds like he's tired of the pressure and if they are still together for a 4th album they better put something much better than this if they don't want to lose their entire fanbase.
B0000029GA|5.0|From start to finish, nas spits his rhymes with the best talent i have EVER heard, not at one point does nas drop a bad line and every line fits perfectly with the last. I personelly think this is the best rap/hip-hop album ever made because of the amazing lyrical talent and classic production from DJ Premier, The Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip and Big L-E-S. The beats are so good to listen to and fit perfectly with nas' style. The only guest appearance comes from AZ on \\"Life's A Bitch\\". The track is more AZ than Nas and AZ shows he can rap to the same standed as Nas but Nas outdoes him with his verse, it is also the best verse on the album. It makes you wonder how nas can drop such complicated lines and still have enough breathe left to say the next. The album is largely dedicated to one of nas' fallen homies - Illwill - as he mentiones his name on almost every track. The best thing about Illmatic is that nas doesn't care about bling, bling and hoes, all he cares about is droping the best rhymes possible and telling it how it is without bringing in gun talk like 50 cent and other rappers around today, also the album isn't overly explicit and does'nt dwell on sex and murder. <br />If your a rap & hip hop fan and you don't own Illmatic you have a major problem, theres only one way to fix it - buy the album today!

B00005QFE5|3.0|A visitor to China recently remarked that there was a traffic jam of bicycles in Peking when she visited 6 years ago, but today there is traffic jam of automobiles.  After the disasters of Socialism and the murdering fraud, Mao, China finally allows economic freedom, and bingo, prosperity arrives.  Chinese cinema is taking a recent look back at the disaster and forward to the future like a recovering cancer victim.  The drama is in the past, the individual versus the iron boot of the Bureaucrats. <br /> <br />Zhao Di is beautiful as the young girl in love with the new teacher.  Since the villagers usually arrange marriages, this love affair, chaste as it is, is something new for the agrarians.  Cruelly separated from her suitor by the State, Zhao must wait for years to unite with her husband.  The theme: love overcomes all, or China becomes itself.  You choose.  The film is slow going, sentimental, and the plot is threadbare. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Thank you to all involved in this movie and series. The series was <br />great and the movie is even more amazing! The characters are so diverse <br />yet work together great. I can't choose a favorite character or line in <br />the movie without reciting the whole thing! Everyone should see this <br />movie at least once!  <br /> <br />  The camera work is awesome and shows the nature of the film as unique and unafraid.  Joss Whedon is an amazing writer and director.  From Buffy to Angel and now to Serenity, I am hooked on the great comedy, quick turn of events, and action that these teams produce.  Serenity is a must see movie and a great story that I hope continues. <br /> <br />~Rustina
0141439513|4.0|This timeless classic by Jane Austin is probably the best illustration of why we should not let ourselves be guided by first impressions.  Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them.  Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad).  She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him.  I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it.  Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham.  She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.<br /><br />As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written.  There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action.  I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.<br /><br />I also loved the believableness of her characters.  Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era.  I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well.  Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader.  Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books.
B00005JO1G|5.0|Jarhead is my absolute favorite movie i've seen it almost five times, to me they don't get any better. It's a true story that follows the marine Anthony Swofford from training to war,theres not alot of action in it because it shows you how he deals with everything he's thrown into. The cast is great, Jake Gyllenhaal became one of my favorite actors because of this movie. All around this movie is great and should be loved by everyone. I suggest reading the book also because it's even better then the movie.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|i would like to start off by saying this is easily going to be one of the best albums of the year. these guys are young, very talented, and deffinately doing the music industry a friggin service. in a society thats constantly being over run with all this emo crap its refreshing to finally hear a band that doesnt bitch about slitting their wrists and getting dumped. i really like M Shadows' voice style on this album. apparently he had throat surgery or something (?) which affected his singing ability but it sounds fine to me (that was directed at the jackass whos complaining about not enough screaming) the leads on this album are really something else. if youve read any of my other reviews (Trivium, Ascendancy....under the name mikerules or something...?), then you know that i play guitar my self. its great to see, and i think any other experienced player would agree with me, some new blood in the biz that actually knows what the hell they're doing. on the downside, i did find just a few flaws. sure these guys are young, but i think they need to grow up a little. musically, that is. example: they start off a song and its heavy and whatnot, but then it goes into this unexpected breakdown of a happier, nicer vibe. now, i understand these guys are going for a hybrid mix of punk and thrash metal, but i dont think this will cut it. metal is not exactly the happiest stuff around. another thing i didnt like was that the song just went on and on and on......i respect that and all becuase a song that long was probly a pain to record in the studio or whatever but i honestly got pretty bored. but enough negativity. i sure hope these guys come out with more albums something like this in the future. theyre headed in the right direction thats for sure. lets keep it that way.

B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young's place in the pantheon of, whatever you want to call it...let's just say \\"all music\\" is assured. He is one of the greatest musical artists ever, end of story. Whether or not this album is a critical and/or commercial hit is immaterial: people will still be discussing Neil's stuff in perpetuity... <br /> <br />So...does this hold up against his best stuff and is it one of his best? I don't think so...He treads the fine line between art and sentimentality and veers into the sappy and bathetic a little too much here... <br /> <br />When it works, it really works well though, as in \\"The Painter\\", \\"This Old Guitar\\" and \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\"... <br /> <br />Overall, a beautiful disc to listen to though, with great backing from such gifted studio stalwarts as Spooner Oldham, etc...just not the best songwriting NY is capable of.... <br />

B00005AQGH|5.0|I think this is 2Pac's best album, even better then All Eyez On Me. My Favorite track is \\"Krazy\\". Now on to the fools who hate this album just because of the cover art. This is his best album hard, deep and his last real album so if you don't listen to it that's your sad choice but I'm enjoying it everyday. Let me paste a quote from 2Pac himself about this album so you know it's not about mocking Christ or anything like that. <br /> <br />\\"Now, it's for fun. This new Makaveli album I got comin' out, I'm takin' on niggas. It's like, my dopest album ever. It's 12 tracks. I talk about my shooting [in New York]. I say the names of the niggas that shot me, the names of the niggas that set me up.... Everything I couldn't say, I said it in a rap. I also dis Dre, I dis Mobb Deep. All them niggas: Jay-Z, Puffy, Biggie. My album cover is me on the cross being crucified, and the cross is the map. It's got New York, Harlem, Brooklyn, everything. And I'm on the cross bein' crucified for keepin' it real.\\" <br /> <br />Where in that quote does he say he thinks of himself as the Messiah or God? He just thinks he and Christ had something in common, telling the truth and taking all kinds of crap for it (eventually dying for it). R.I.P. T. Shakur & Long Live Makaveli!
B00005JOM9|5.0|Prior to seeing Transamerica, I have not seen any of Felicity Huffman's work, not even the Desperate Housewives, and I must say that her performance in this film is by far the best and most challenging by an actress this year. I can say that her transformation is very convincing and subtle, because I have known numerous drag queens, transvesites, preoperative transsexuals. I am very impressed by her makeup, voice, and mannerism. She's obviously done a lot of work and research preparing for the role of Bree/Stanley. This is a really great roadtrip movie filled with plenty of funny and touching moments. I was amazed to see that most of the audiences were women and straight couples.<br /><br />Huffman plays a Bree, a preoperative transgender person on the verge going through her sexual reassignment operation. Just one week before she completely becomes a woman physically, she's informed that she has a 17 year old son who was arrestted for drug use, and she must go and bail him out. Kevin Zegers plays the rebellious Toby who is a ranaway and works as a street hustler. Upon meeting Bree, he unsuspectingly believes that she's actually from the Christian missionary. The father/mother and son then embark on a roadtrip across America to Los Angeles. Along the way, they came across a hitchhiker who later stole their car, and then got helped by a Native Indian who had a crush on Bree. Bree also stopped at Kentuckey to allow Toby to visit his step father and foster family, but things got rather ugly when Toby confronted his stepfather who used to abuse and molested him, and that his mother also committed suicide years ago.<br /><br />Later on, Bree pays an unannouced visit to her estranged parents house in Phoenix. Bree's parents were surprised and shocked by the new appearance of their son. At one point, her mother(Fionnula Flanagan) said,\\"I love you, but I don't respect you...\\", and she was so happy and relieved to learn that Toby was her grandson. But Bree has yet to disclose her true identity to Toby before going back to L.A. for the surgery....<br /><br />Kevin Zegers has come a long way since his Airbud movies, and he's probably going to become the biggest Canadian actor to rise to the top in Hollywood. He held his own opposite brilliant actors like Fionnula Flanagan and Huffman. He's willing to do nudity and gay love scenes in this film. Flanagan gave a scene-stealing performance, but she's somewhat underexposed. Elizabeth Pena is also wonderful as Bree's compassionate best friend/therapist. I had lauged so many times throughout this film, and the post surgery scene just moved me to massive tears. Ultimately, I think this generated the best performance from Filicity Huffman, and I have a feeling that she will take home the gold along with Phillip Seymour Hoffman at the Oscar this year.close her true identity to Toby before going back to L.A. for the surgery.... <br /> <br />Kevin Zegers has come a long way since his Airbud movies, and he's probably going to become the biggest Canadian actor to rise to the top in Hollywood.

0553801503|5.0|I've read quite a few of the negative review, with many saying that the series has become remeniscent of The Wheel of Time.  Not having read those books I can't really comment on that, but what I will say is that I loved this book, as I have loved the previous three.  My only complaint is that I have to wait another year for the next installment.  I found every chapter engrossing, and I love all of the characters, even the new ones.  A Song of Ice and Fire is easily my favorite series of all time.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm a pretty objective Madge fan here.  I dig most of her stuff, but some of her musical outings have been pretty crappy to say the least. <br /> <br />Ray of Light (1998) as an album is hard to surpass...it was an amazing album, one where Madge basically re-claimed her musical relevance.  BUT...while definitely not reaching the perfect blend of emotion, lyrical content, and heady music that Ray of Light contained (and in a slightly lesser sense, '89's Like a Prayer album)...Confessions is far better then 2003's American Life, and overall, a stronger album then 2000's Music. <br /> <br />I'll just got track by track, and keep it simple.  I rated the tracks on a scale of 1 to 5. <br /> <br />Hung Up-4 stars, this song gets pretty annoying after awhile, and I think she tries too hard to be \\"catchy\\" so to speak at times...but overall, it's a strong track, and an excellent choice for a first single. <br /> <br />Get Together-5 stars, I hated this song when I first heard it...the sample made me think...\\"why must you sample Madge?  Rather pathetic.\\"  But, after repeated listenings, you realize this song is rather brilliant, beautiful, and that Madge does the sample of \\"Music Sounds Better With You\\" justice. <br /> <br />Sorry-3 stars, rumored to be the second single...probably the catchiest track off the album, but after some time, it loses its magic in my opinion.  I dig Madge saying \\"sorry\\" in a bunch of international languages though...cool touch. <br /> <br />Future Lovers-3 stars...this track needs something extra to make it work.  Not even the Donna Summer sample saves this song from mediocrity.  Not the worst track on the album, but in this track, the album starts go downhill a little bit. <br /> <br />I Love New York-3 stars, if you listen to this track on her documentary \\"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret\\"...it's a funky, rock-inspired track that is destined to be a single.  On this album, the track is re-worked to fit the album and they basically ruin the track.  The only thing which saves this from getting two stars is the fact that it has \\"New York\\" in it, which is the city I live in, and love. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be-4 stars, excellent track...starts out slow, you're wondering when it'll pick up, and about three-fourths of the way into the song...it breaks into a beautiful mix of club sounds, and orchestra.  We hear Madge sing about success, the rise/fall of it, etc. in this track (a little tiresome to hear after a bit). <br /> <br />Forbidden Love-1 star, basically, it's crap. <br /> <br />Jump-5 stars...my 2nd favorite track off the album.  This is a very old-school Madge track...she sings about her arrival to NYC, her struggle to find herself, support herself...her willingness to take the risks she needed to take in order to make a name for herself.  The production is beautiful and layered, but not overtly so.  Definitely one of the best. <br /> <br />How High-1 star, crap again. <br /> <br />Isaac-3 stars, the lyrics are a bit trite, but well...Madge can be that way sometimes.  The track is simply something that tries hard to be club-sounding and somewhat spiritual at the same time...the marriage doesn't quite come together unfortunately. <br /> <br />Push-1 star, crap once again...ahh Madge...when will you learn? <br /> <br />Like it or Not-4.5 stars, this track is a wonderful way to end the album.  Although the lyrics fail at times, there's a brilliant part in the song where she sings, \\"I'll be the garden/You'll be the snake/All of my fruit is yours to take/Better the devil that you know/Your love for me will grow/Because.../This is who I am...\\"---it's mellow, but still has a dance beat to it.  Excellent track. <br /> <br />Overall...what saves the album from a general 3 star mark is the fact that the standout tracks are truly standout.  The filler stuff is so-so, but what keeps the album from truly reaching a valid 5 stars is the fact that the crap on this album is simply bad, bad, bad.  Still, the crap on hereis actually better then the crap tracks she had on American Life, and thank God for that.  Since I can't give the album a 3.8, I'll default to a 4. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QF14|4.0|I consider myself to be the most extreme form of a diehard Green Day fan. Not only am I obsessive about their music, but the personalities of Green Day's members also keep me craving more. I was glad that after purchasing this DVD, I received a glimpse of what goes on before a Green Day concert behind the scenes - and it is just as hilarious as I expected. The content on the DVD is amazing; most of the show's set was present, the interviews with Billie, Mike, and Tre were original and interesting, and the footage of the guys just fooling around was also very entertaining. Like others have said, the camera angles were a bit extreme at times, and one major disappointment presented itself when a few of the impressive fiery explosions during the show were later changed to black-and-white by the production designers! I was shocked and very upset by this, because who can marvel at a pyro-spectacle when there is no color to it? This was especially noticeable at the end of the \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\" performance. I also just wish that the entire concert had been shown on the DVD; why was there a limit to how much footage could be shown, anyways? This review is starting to sound negative, so I'll wrap it up here: Bullet in a Bible is DEFINITELY a must-have for any Green Day fan, it really shows how amusing the guys are, and gives the viewer a true appreciation for what this band does - their energy and love for performing is just astounding. The songs sound good, but it's obvious that the production team had their way with a few of the songs in the beginning (Billie Joe's guitar isn't even audible until \\"Longview\\"). I love this DVD, I've watched it repeatedly, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Okay now for the real review. Bottom line, this is the way to end an epic film. True, it was a very different movie that volume 1, but that's what make it good. Yeah Beatrix finally gets Bill, but the movie has a bigger focus than that. We actually get to see a lot of things that were left open after vol 1. First, and in my opinion, most importantly, we see exactly how Beatrix got the skill to kill all of those against her. Her teacher gave her some seriously brutal training. Obviously it was well worth it. Second, we find out why she left Bill in the first place. And why Bill decided that she needs to die. And we finally see how Elle lost her freakin eye(sweet!). Okay, there wasn't half as much blood and violence in this one as vol 1, but the fight with Beatrix and Elle was off the chain. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone who has not seen it but, this is a damn good movie. For the full experience, watch vols 1 and 2 back to back. Killer series Quentin.
068987751X|5.0|This is a favorite in our family!  My 10 month old son loves this book and we read it at least once a day.  We have been reading it to him for several months and it is by far his favorite book out of all the books we read.  He now lifts all the flaps on each page and knows what is under each flap.  He loves the puppy at the end and pats his head.  We also bought the \\"Dear Santa\\" book and have started reading that as well.  I strongly recommend this book for children 7 months and up.
B000002P5W|5.0|No one played guitar like Hendrix-- before or since. And I was lucky to have seen him play live in 1967. Who else wore paisely purple bellbottoms back then and got away with it? 1967 was the year when the world was re-invented.  In fact, seers tell Metamorpho that the coming of Jimi Hendrix foretold the revision of the calendar, as we know it, but this has not been made public yet.  So please don't ask.  Where was I? Oh yeah...Jimi.<br /><br />  Well..... Jimi set the bar higher than ever before.  Cute little pop groups were sent scurrying home to cry.  How could  they compete with this monstrous talent? Considerable people. VERY considerable.  My favorite Hendrix albums are the first three. They all have great things to offer - with great psychedelia effects.  However, I do think his strongest effort is Axis - just ask the Metamorpho!<br /><br />  Jimi was from another planet, as is Metamorpho, thus I can appreciate how it begins with EXP and then the lead-in to Up From The Skys.  Hendrix had a style of writing that made you believe he was just visiting this earth - which, of course, he was.  We all are. But that is another matter.<br /><br />  What can I say? These songs are tough, well-oiled guitar grit and some lovely passages thrown in just to show you what talent is behind it.  Ahhhhhh..... and the lessons and knowledge he imparts to us is witty and succinct, i.e; \\"Castles made of sand, drift in the sea..eventually\\", \\"Click bang, what a hang, your Daddy just shot poor me\\", \\"I've got my own world to live through and I ain't gonna copy you!\\". And with \\"Bold As Love\\", all the colors mean something, but all of them together means they are bold as Love.  What great writing. What guitar playing! Jimi ruled his own kingdom that absolutely no one could compete with.<br /><br />  He also wrote the beautiful classic \\"Little Wing\\". One of the greatest love songs in his cannon. Be forewarned... Hendrix was deep into psychedelia at this juncture, so it may not appeal to everybody.  But I think this album is perhaps his most cohesive work.  \\"Are You Experienced\\" was great - but getting used to what the studio would do.  \\"Axis\\" brought forth possibilities and successful experiment. \\"Electric Ladyland\\" examined more possibilities, however, as excellent as it is I think it would be fair to say that it wasn't as controlled- often having mixed results.<br /><br />  Still...... I remember going into New York and listening to an FM car radio (new at the time), and travelling across the George Washington Bridge, and having the start of Axis come on in the twilight.  Just great.  Never to happen again. It is a memory.  Radio stations no longer play album cuts --- unless something is on the playlist.  How sad.  How did we allow our world to become less pleasant?  It is a mystery. But, if you are a Hendrix fan or looking for something different and excellent, I think this definitely one of his best.  Now \\"Excuse me.......I must be on my way.........\\". Time Immortal...Metamorpho.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|'They love you or they hate you.' It seems the first line in new song, Evening Sun, perfectly depicts the way people are reacting to the long-awaited album from the New York five-piece who emerged in 2001. This album actually takes a few listens to get used to how different it is from Is This It and Room On Fire. When Room on Fire was realeased in '03, the band were bashed in the media for their lack of creativity on their sophomore effort, and this I beleive triggered such a dramatic change in style on First Impressions. For starters, the vocals on this album float over the mix a lot more. The signature distortion of Julian Casablancas' voice has been removed, a detail which I was disappointed with when I first heard about it, but it is for the best. The music is more exciting, more involved, and the lyrics deal with a few big issues this time around. <br />Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. really shine on this album. The guitar work is stunning. Nikolai on bass gives out some heavy riffs. And Fab on drums is amazing on track, 15 minutes. The music seems to have so many different layers, which, frontman Julian Cadsblancas reported, was due to the fact that the songs took a lot more time and were able to grow a lot more. Songs draw on mid-eastern influence, heavier riffs, even a SOAD-style solo. Also, Julian's voice is pitched a lot lower and higher than previous albums. The chorus from Razorblade even sounds like Barry Manilow's Mandy.  <br />The album standouts are: <br />You Only Live Once <br />Juicebox <br />Ize of the World <br />Razorblade  <br />Electricityscape <br />Vision of Division <br /> <br />All in all, the album is a positive advance in the careers of these NYC boys. Is it their best album? No. But there's no chance of it being their last.
B00004YZFR|5.0|I confess that I'm a sucker for all things Maysles, but this might have been their finest moment (with the possible exception of \\"Salesman\\"). The combination of their unique documentary technique, the inherent mystique of the Rolling Stones, and the tragic events of Altamont make for a film you can't turn your eyes away from. We all know what happened, and yet you find yourself spellbound as the events unfold, and they still seem fresh--and sad--when they happen. Wisely, the Maysles avoided commentary, either on the Stones themselves or the individuals involved in the melee. You, the viewer, are left to merely watch what happened and make up your own mind. Regardless of where you come down, this is an invaluable and fascinating historical document of a day that, for all intents and purposes, spelled the end of the lovefest of the 60's.
B000000HXK|5.0|This is an album of controversies, entire soundscapes built on nuances and changes, seemingly a testimony that nothing can last.  Built on a bed of electronic sound and rounded off with acoustic pianos and percussion, each song unfolds slowly, allowing one to savour each and every moment. A lone piano melody starts off 'The Loom', which is then joined by gentle violins and percussion, then climaxes with bass and Graham Sutton's vocals to melt away into synthesizers and drums that slowly wind down to the end. Screeching, howling electric guitar and tinkling piano play off each other on 'Fingerspit'. 'Eyes and Smiles', the best song on the album, is built on beautiful synthesizer melodies and gently tinkling cymbals, which rise and fall with the vocals and work their way to a climatic ending around Sutton screaming that 'you've got to go on.' To end the album, 'Pendulum Man' is a quiet, meditative, and immensely beautiful synthesizer piece. The other songs are all excellent as well, giving a well-rounded album that is beautiful and immersing, leaving one aching for more.
B000BWI9U0|3.0|As far as I'm concerned, The Strokes pointed the way music was headed with their seminal album \\"Is this It\\" a few years back.  I was all kinds of pumped to get \\"Room on Fire\\" only to be dumbfounded with the songs I was hearing there.  I completely junked it after listening to it for a few weeks after it came out only to have it start growing on me two or three months ago.  The lyrics were always there, it just took me awhile to get used to the \\"new\\" Strokes sound, which really wasn't all that far off from the debut anyways.  I've been playing out \\"Room on Fire\\" in anticipation for the new album, and Juicebox is the hot single on radio so I picked it up today.  I must say if I was dumbfounded by the new sound on the 2nd album, I've gone vegetable on this one.  First thing, it sounds really polished and produced this time around and makes me wonder if the not-so-stellar reviews of Room on Fire perhaps got them to sell out and try to go a bit more mainstream.  The drums sound like they souped up a drum machine and went with it and Julian now belts out more vocally on most of the tracks instead of his trademark mumble.  Maybe its just me, but part of the Strokes appeal was that they seemed to be on the underground and their music had a snarl to it.  To me, they are one of the few bands that can be considered the \\"real deal\\"  But all the production on this album is starting to obscure that for me.  I'm all for branching out a bit, like on Room on Fire, but don't rob the songs of their essence with this over-produced schlock.
B000001FZK|5.0|This album ranks as the single greatest album of all time, in its immersive, breath-taking beauty and singularly groundbreaking innovation. An album that starts from the ground (silence) up, built on thought-provoking lyrics and simple acoustic melodies, with six simplistic and heartbreakingly beautiful songs that defined a new, undefinable genre: some called it 'post-rock' or 'avant garde', but most denied even to try and brand it with a label. It's unclassifiable, proving Talk Talk were truly the most innovative group of their (and perhaps all) time. <br />'Myrrhman' is silence and sound at the same time. It starts with twenty seconds of hissing feedback and nothing else, then lightly and sporadically strummed guitars, single piano notes, and light violin strings gently pervade and build a semi-melody that backs Mark Hollis' gentle vocals, rising and falling in volume, occasional quiet drum beats stepping in to lend their emphasis. As Hollis' vocals waver away, violin strings well up and slowly carry the song to its end. <br />'Ascension Day' builds around an opposite principle of noticeable sound, starting with pronounced drums and acoustic bass, which then give way to a slamming, howling electric guitar, which only quiet to allow Hollis to sing increasingly shorter verses that eventually dissipate to allow the guitar to resume its tirade, which mounts to slam to a sudden halt. <br />'After the Flood', which I personally consider the greatest song of all time, starts with a tinkling piano solo superseded by a patient organ ritornelle, joined by a wailing guitar string and gentle drums to lend backing to Hollis' verses. An instrumental section ensues, which uses affected saxophones to create the tumultous wail of honking geese, with then give way to gradually return to Hollis' singing, as the song slowly fades away to an ending. <br />'Taphead' starts out with a simple six-note guitar solo, which is joined by Hollis' voice for the first few verses, then is eclipsed by howling, blasting horns and low-key organ motifs, which later rejoin with Hollis' voice as he yells 'dust to dust to dust to dust to dust', then fade away into incoherent mumbling and quiet guitar once again. <br />'New Grass' begins with drums and a strummed guitar, which rise to meet Hollis' singing, then fade into piano, then rise to Hollis' renewed vocals, then slowly fade away again into oblivion. <br />'Runeii' is built completely around silence. A picked acoustic guitar provides sporadic bits of melody while Hollis' whispers his lyrics, and a few piano notes occasionally play in the far-off background. This song emerges from silence and descends back into it. A fitting metaphor for life. Or Talk Talk themselves.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I am a little shocked to hear that their singer (Hayley)is 16 years old. I assumed early 20s. Anyway...This CD is fresh. That is the best way I can describe it. It sounds minty. It is being advertized as sounding like Acceptance, Fall Out Boy, or Jimmy Eat World with a girl singer, but it sounds nothing like fallout boy. The comparison with Acceptance might be the best one. I believe that there will be haters trying to shoot this one down based on the fact that it is an optomistic \\"feel good\\" CD and most people who enjoy bashing bands are cynical depressed people. I definately recommend this album to anyone who wants to be refreshed and uplifted. If you really don't like it at first listen to it a few times. The more I listen to it the more I like it. Wow...She is really 16?!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" lives up to its promise, regaling both dedicated fans and newly christened accolytes with a retrospective odyssey of the divine M's celebrated career.  The album promises a return to disco, which is granted, but the style is simultaneously distinctively futuristic and postmodern.  The first single, \\"Hung Up,\\" which borrows promiscuously from ABBA's classic anthem \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" topped TRL for a consecutive week, a first for Madonna in the TRL age, signalling a successful marketing strategy from MTV's original video marketing strategist to rope in a younger audience.  We old-timers who grew up on MTV in the DAY already know that the lady is a DIVA!  \\"Hung Up\\" also topped the Eurocharts for seven successive weeks (and counting) and topped the Dance Charts (Madonna's first home) for six weeks (and counting), making it the biggest dance single of 2005.  Madonna fans expect no less from our First Lady of Pop!  Madonna fans also love ABBA and undoubtedly appreciate the renewed interest in their music and musical \\"Mama Mia.\\"    Rumor has it that Madonna will collaborate with the Pet Shop Boys for remixes of her next single, \\"Sorry.\\"  Madonna plans to stage the video using MTV's \\"Pimp My Ride,\\" of which she is a great fan, as the concept.  \\"Pimp\\" focuses on the retooling of a vintage classic into a modern, adrenaline-pulsing, fully equipped modern drive.  The symbolism of using MTV's \\"Pimp My Ride\\" as a vehicle (pun intended) for Madonna's second \\"Confessions\\" video is obvious:  makeover a vintage classic and resell it to the youthful masses.  Madonna (pure vintage) has returned to her MTV origins to resell a classic (herself) to a new generation.  \\"Sorry\\" is undoubtedly the most intense, radio-friendly Madonna song to hit the airwaves since \\"Get Into the Groove,\\"\\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Vogue.\\"  The song features Madonna saying \\"I'm sorry/Forgive me\\" in at least ten different languages.  Ironically, \\"Sorry\\" may bethe song that simultaneously displaces Elvis' top-10 chart-topping record AND pushes Madonna into the number 5 position of top-selling recording artist of all time.  Ironic because she will displace ABBA, who currently hold the number 5 position by about 10 million in sales (pre-\\"Confessions\\"), and from whom she borrowed from for 2005's \\"Hung Up.\\"  Her worldwide albums and singles sales exceed those of Mariah Carey by about 50 million.  Additionally, she's surpassed Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Elton John and most other solo artists you can think of.  British superstar duo the Pet Shop Boys have reportedly agreed to remix the single.      The rumored third single, \\"Jump,\\" is a feminist anthem rivalling \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" for power in combining both energy and message.  \\"Jump\\" coincidentally borrows the bass-line from the Pet Shop Boys' Number One smash \\"West End Girls.\\"  Much earlier in her storied career, Madonna was slated to perform a duet of \\"Heart,\\" a Pet Shop Boys (PSB) classic.  The collaboration never materialized and, sadly, PSB released the song as a single, unadorned with Madonna's distinctive vocals (though it remains one of my favorite PSB songs!).  Apparently the Material Mom is making up for lost time, and with a vengeance ....    \\"Get Together,\\" the second track, is another likely hit.  \\"Get Together\\" retrospectively samples M's original chart classic \\"Holiday\\" AND Madonna's Daft Punk's sampling of \\"Music Sounds Better with You\\" in the remixed encore performance of \\"Holiday\\" in the \\"Drowned World\\" tour.  In other words, \\"Get Together\\" features Madonna borrowing Daft Punk's bassline remix of her own originary dancehall classic \\"Holiday.\\"  Doubtful that anyone can accuse her of plagiarism on this one.  She's plagiarising herself, and in a wonderful, contemporary way!  Madonna's vocals on \\"Get Together\\" reflect haunting vulnerability amidst pulsating rhythms.  The combination is the most irresistable dance number since ROL's \\"Skin.\\"  As was the case with \\"Skin,\\" Madonna may elect not to release this glorious track, which makes purchasing the album in its entirety worthwhile.  I would like to see her release \\"Get Together\\" as a single, perhaps selling it (remixes included) as part of the ticket price to her rumoured 2006 tour, just as Prince did for his \\"Musicology\\" album.  The single tour-generated sales would be a sure-fire means of landing her another top-10 hit, one that could actually top the charts once airplay kicks in and the public recognizes \\"Together\\" as sheer pop glory!    \\"Forbidden Love,\\" the seventh track, recalls the best of Erasure.  Madonna should release a gay-friendly version of the song simultaneous with its mainstream release.  She would only have to tweak one lyric, and here is my suggesion:    ORIGINAL:  \\"Once upon a time, there was a boy, there was a girl/Hearts that intertwined, they lived in a different kind of world\\"    GAY VERSION:  \\"Once upon a time, there was a boy, there was a man/Hearts that intertwined, they lived in a different kind of land.\\"    Simple enough, eh?  Enough to stir controvery from the religious right.    \\"I Love New York\\" could serve as a political anthem for Hillary Clinton.  I love the energy and insistence of this song.  \\"Future Lovers\\" suggests a future collaboration with Donna Summer (DS recently collaborated with West End, so why not Madonna?).  FL features Madonna delivering seductive, soothing promises in a manner reminscent of 90s artists Enigma but with musical accompaniment echoing \\"Sky Fits Heaven.\\"  \\"How High\\" is Britanny Spears-esque and \\"Push\\" (the apparent sequel to \\"Borderline\\") channels Kylie Minogue (as does \\"Get Together).  Madonna, who publically championed Kylie during her breast cancer struggles, understands that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.  \\"Isaac\\" is the 21st century version of \\"Frozen,\\" and a philosophic commentary on the concept of meaningfulness, delivered in artful form.  This is the most emotionally moving track on the album.  \\"Like It or Not\\" contains clever rhymes to a grinding \\"Fever\\" backdrop.  Love this number!  \\"Let It Will Be,\\" which brilliantly evokes what listeners and viewers find most brilliant about Madonna, contains the mesmerizing, grandiose orchestral movements of \\"Evita\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach,\\" as stunningly presented during her \\"Blonde Ambition\\" tour.  \\"LIWB\\" nevertheless retains the dynamic energy of a solid dancefloor classic, as it has Madonna challenging, \\"Just watch me burn!\\"  With 34 number one dancefloor chart-topping singles (and counting) and not a contender in sight, Madonna does indeed scorch the world's dancefloors as no one has done since ABBA and the BeeGees!  Actually, it's time to start comparing everyone to her at this juncture!  This track is certainly worthy of Madge.    In the end, the album is top drawer.  I've had it since the day it was released in the U.S. and still listen to it everyday.  I've not grown bored with any of the songs.  Even if you purchase the album and don't think enough of the songs are radio-friendly (which is unlikely since at least four are), \\"Confessions,\\" at 56 minutes, represents the ultimate workout accompaniment.    Five stars, no question.  If you elimiated all the Mariah and J. Lo fans who have given the album one star in the spirit of partisanship, this album would be the best-reviewed offering on Amazon of Madonna's career.  Four and a half stars, with more than a hundred one-star Madonna-hating reviews, equals a five-star album.  Check it out!
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Great books make terrible movies,\\" has been a cinematic rule of thumb for generations. Commonly, the problem lies in trying to compress a lengthly novel (usually digested by the reader in small chunks) into a two hour movie--the action becomes telescoped, the motivations of the characters trite or simply incomprehensible. Less frequently, an attempt to remain faithful to the text results in a bloated monstrosity which is equally hard on the patience and the hindquarters.<br /><br />At 55 pages, Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain is ideally suited for the silver screen. The adaptation by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the short story--much of the dialogue is lifted from the book verbatim. The film highlights the books' contradictions: epic, yet intimate; stark, yet lush. The characters speak in their silences as much as in dialogue. This is a story that could be only set in America. Yet, it is an irony that Asian born Ang Lee has directed a definitive American masterpiece.<br /><br />Much will be made of Brokeback Mountain's treatment of homosexuality. But sexual orientation is not the main issue. Honesty is. None of the four main characters in Brokeback Mountain attain happiness--and it's all because of the lie. Ennis and Jack fall in love while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. It is chalked up to loneliness and horniness, and written off as a one time deal. Ennis marries Alma, while Jack marries Lureen. In 1967, Jack and Ennis reunite, and the lie perpetuates. Alma spots them kissing and denies what she sees. She never even mentions it to Ennis until a decade later. Ennis and Jack continue to meet sporadically over the years. Given the era and the culture, there are no options for them to live openly. By the time he's 30, Ennis has deteriorated into a virtual automaton, only fully human when he's with Jack. Ennis and Alma divorce in 1975, while Jack's marriage cools into a business partnership. Unless one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.<br /><br />So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True. Lies, obfuscation, and concealment poison the soul--more than any sexual act or deviation from religious doctrine.<br /><br />Every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is outstanding: cinematography, editing, makeup (the characters convincingly age twenty years without overdoing it), music (just enough to highlight the story). But it's the acting which will stand out.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's performance is masterful. He plays Ennis as a terrified loner, hiding his emotions beneath a gruff exterior, his cowboy hat shielding his eyes. Ennis is so controlled by his fear that his heart breaks just as he realizes he has one. Jack Twist is a more open hearted character than Ennis, easier to read, and because of this Jake Gyllenhaal's equally commanding performance may be overshadowed by Ledger's. But he merits recognition as well. These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles.<br /><br />Regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time. Just as 1939 is remembered as the year of Gone With the Wind, generations from now 2005 will be remembered as the year of Brokeback Mountain.ess one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.  <br /> <br />So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True.

Jack Twist is a more open hearted character than Ennis, easier to read, and because of this Jake Gyllenhaal's equally commanding performance may be overshadowed by Ledger's. But he merits recognition as well. These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles. <br /> <br />Regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time. Just as 1939 is remembered as the year of Gone With the Wind, generations from now 2005 will be remembered as the year of Brokeback Mountain.  <br /> <br />
0471267554|3.0|[Edit: see update below.] The Paleo Diet by Loren Cordain, Ph.D. is a monumental work that brilliantly explains and popularizes what may well be one of the biggest breakthroughs in scientific understanding in human history: the evolutionary hypothesis of human nutrition and lifestyle. This hypothesis does what no other diet and exercise regime does: it builds a scientific model that can be used to make predictions that can be tested and it does so upon the very foundation of biology--evolution.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of explaining this model and how to put it to use. Dr. Cordain's style is eminently readable, so it is understandable to the layperson while maintaining a scientific and evidence-based approach. Endnotes would make the book even better.<br /><br />Those scientists who are using this evolutionary model of nutrition predict that the healthiest foods for humans will be the natural foods that humans have been eating for the last 2.5 million years--not the agrarian and processed foods of the last ten thousand years--and that an optimal diet will approximate as much as possible the types of diets that Paleolithic peoples consumed.<br /><br />Most other diets take a hit-or-miss, after-the-fact approach, focusing on the micro level of what certain scientific studies and anecdotal evidence suggest about the healthiness of certain foods and diets, and from the aggregation of some of this data, try to determine the optimal dietary approach. As new data comes in that contradicts the old, upheavals in dietary fads occur and many people become confused and discouraged by the conflicting signals they receive over the years. As others have noted, Paleolithic-based diets are the only non-fad diets, since they span hundreds of thousands and millions of years, not decades.<br /><br />The most common criticism of the evolutionary hypothesis of diet and lifestyle involves comparative life expectancy. Assumptions are made that people live much longer and healthier lives today than Stone Agers did, and that Stone Agers did not live long enough to acquire the chronic degenerative diseases of modern civilization. The idea that hunter gatherers' lives were \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" is actually an exaggeration that was popularized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. Dr. Cordain explains (as have others) the scientific findings that human life expectancies DECLINED when Stone Age hunter-gatherers adopted an agrarian lifestyle at the start of the Neolithic era. The later increases in life expectancy were mainly due to public health advances in sanitation, food safety, quarantine systems, immunizations and childbirth survival rates. Thirty three years was the estimated AVERAGE life expectancy of a Paleolithic hunter-gatherer male, not the maximal lifespan of all hunter gatherers. A hunter gatherer who survived childbirth, infectious disease, accidents, battles, and wild animals could be expected to live as long as we do today. Moreover, archaeological and anthropological studies of Paleolithic records and contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures show much lower prevalence of heart disease, sudden cardiac death, cancer, stroke and even acne than in modern societies.<br /><br />Professor Jared Diamond, the famous evolutionary biologist and author, went so far as to state that \\"recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture ... was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered. With agriculture came the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism, that curse our existence. ... Hunter-gatherers practiced the most successful and longest-lasting life style in human history. In contrast, we're still struggling with the mess into which agriculture has tumbled us, and it's unclear whether we can solve it.\\"<br /><br />Those questions that Cordain didn't handle thoroughly in his book are addressed on his website (...).  Perhaps future editions of the book will include the additional details and defenses that Cordain has posted on his site. For example, Cordain responds to another common objection to The Paleo Diet--that hunter gatherers favored fatty cuts of meat and that Cordain is therefore wrong to suggest that we restrict our intake of saturated fat. Cordain agrees that \\"There is absolutely no doubt that hunter-gatherers favored the fattiest part of the animals they hunted and killed\\" (such as the tongue and brains). But this does not mean that we should eat unlimited quantities of fatty domestic meats, as Cordain explains: \\"Not surprisingly, these organs are all relatively high in fat, but more importantly analyses from our laboratories showed the types of fats in tongue, brain, and marrow are healthful, unlike the high concentrations of saturated fats found in fatty domestic meats. Brain is extremely high in polyunsaturated fats including the health-promoting omega-3 fatty acids, whereas the dominant fat in tongue and marrow are the cholesterol lowering monounsaturated fats.\\" Cordain points out that modern feedlot cattle typically have 30% body fat or greater, versus the 10% body fat that wild Paleolithic animals averaged on a year round basis.<br /><br />Cordain also explains on his site that the question of saturated fat is more complicated than a simple good-or-bad debate would indicate. Some saturated fat is good (stearic acid) and some is bad (palmitic acid, lauric acid, and myristic acid). Wild animals have more of the good saturated fat than domestic animals.<br /><br />As scientific understanding of the new field of evolutionary nutrition advances, some of Cordain's recommendations may well be revised. Cordain has already modified one of his recommendations: he no longer recommends using flaxseed oil in cooking (he still recommends consuming it cold, adding it to meats after cooking them and to salads) and acknowledges that was an error.<br /><br />Cordain was first \\"enlightened\\" about diet by S. Boyd Eaton's 1985 article in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled \\"Paleolithic Nutrition.\\" Accumulating evidence and growing scientific opinion suggests that S. Boyd Eaton, Loren Cordain and others have indeed started a scientific revolution. I believe that this book will be seen in retrospect as an early classic in this revolution's development.<br /><br />One doesn't even need to accept the evolutionary model in order to recognize the wisdom of this dietary approach. Cordain says that a blueprint for optimal nutrition is built into our genes and \\"Whether you believe the architect of that blueprint is God, or God acting through evolution by natural selection, or by evolution alone, the end result is still the same: We need to give our bodies the foods we were originally designed to eat.\\"<br /><br />[Update: 3.15.14. Rating lowered from 5 to 3. The evolutionary concept was a good one, but most people, including me, who read this book (or similar ones) and are influenced by it tend to end up undereating starchy foods, including importantly beneficial resistant starch (which is converted by gut bacteria into butyrate, a short chain fatty acid, instead of glucose). This book was written before the importance of prebiotics and the Old Friends Hypothesis was widely understood. If you read this book, make sure to also read about those topics.<br /><br />Early critical reviews of this book tended to focus on it as being too negative about saturated fats.

B000BW7QWW|3.0|No, I did not watch Firefly, but I love scifi.  I rented this on word of mouth, and did not know it was linked to a TV series.  This fact is very obvious though, as the movie looks like an installment of a series.  I was surprised it was ever released in theatres, as it feels straight to dvd (lost $15 million in release). <br /> <br />In the future, 2 factions govern man's fate, including a totalitarian regime, that seeks to alter human behavior chemically.  The flashbacks of a conditioned/programmed teen girl 'Firefly' are very interesting, as the mystery of a secret society is revealed.  Social engineering gone awry is not a new theme to scifi, but this movie stays interesting even with mediocre effects and poor acting.
B00005JO04|1.0|This movie has been getting great reviews.  It's supposed to be a message movie about how corruption is behind everything bad that happens in the Middle East.  It stunk.  It managed to be intensely preachy and extremely slow moving at the same time.  In place of subtlety it progressed along an intentionally confusing non-linear storyline; to the extent it has a story.  So it was supposed to be confusing in order to blur its black-and-white message.   I actually didn't find it remotely confusing - I pretty much could see where everything was headed by about 45 minutes into the film.  I guess it did have a storyline, but as it meandered around it didn't feel that way.    That's my biggest problem with it.  As with Traffic, I didn't object so much to the unmistakable message of the movie, just in its telling and in its lack of nuance.  I also found the faux nuance insulting.   <br /> <br />Munich, which hasn't been getting as good reviews, was much better.  I guess some people are finding the mixed message about the cycle of violence objectionable.  Unlike Syriana, exactly what that mixed message is is not exactly clear.  The point seems to be that violence begets violence and is dehumanizing, but at the same time no alternative is presented.   Beyond that, it worked better as a movie.  The story was linear, characters developed and it was simply more interesting to watch.     <br />
B00005JO1J|5.0|I am shocked that a Pulitzer and Tony Award winning play about AIDS is getting so much flack for being a film musical about AIDS. Many complaints by moviegoers stem from the fact that the film is about homosexuality and AIDS and has (supposedly) been falsely advertised. These ignorant people have no doubt been living under a rock for the past ten years to not know what Rent is about. I can't believe they'd expect an entire 135 minute film about people who can't pay their rent? Please! <br /> <br />Rent is one of those movies that makes me realize why I love movies so much. It's passionate, energetic, fun, entertaining, touching, beautiful, and wonderfully romantic. It's everything a movie should be, and more. It's just one of those near-perfect movies that makes you laugh, cry, and want to dance. Once the film is over, it makes you want to see it again, and again, and again. This is the only movie I have ever wanted to see again once it was over, and the only one I bothered to see three times in the theatre (so far). Each time it kept getting better and better. <br /> <br />The songs are superb and add so much depth to the already terrific story, an update of Puccini's opera \\"La Boheme.\\" \\"Light My Candle\\" is a brilliant and fabulous reimagining of the scene in La Boheme where Mimi and Rodolfo first meet. The beat is catchy and the lyrics are fabulous. It is one of my favorite songs in the film, probably a tie with the equally brilliant and wonderfully incorrect \\"La Vie Boheme,\\" the definite show-stopper in a film full of amazing songs. <br /> <br />What makes the film so great more than anything, is the fact that the story is so relatable. Gays, straights, and all those in-between will all find something to love in this movie. The cast all perform well and it was a smart choice to cast the original Broadway cast members in their original roles. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas are perfect substitutes for the only two members of the original cast who didn't return for the film. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Rent is by far the best, and most underrated and least appreciated movie of the year. I think it was lost in the Brokeback Mountain hype, but that film has nothing on this one. Brokeback Mountain was a horrid mess, while Rent is just simply an amazing film. This is one that keeps all those who have seen it flocking back to the theatre. It's really a shame that more people haven't discovered it. I know it's based on a 10 year old Broadway musical, but this is a truly revolutionary film for gay people, not Brokeback Mountain like everyone believes. I felt that had an offensive view of gay men as only being into rough sex. This one showed the tender side of gay relationships, and for that alone, it's a triumph! I really hope audiences discover this gem of a film once the DVD hits stores in February! <br /> <br />
031286504X|5.0|For several days after reading this (a book which is easily consumed in the 90 minutes a film would last) I could NOT stop obsessing on the idea of a film adaptation.  It was already made years ago as the Omega man which is easily forgotten.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was outraged when they took this show off the air.  First, it was brilliantly cast, the writing was amazing and extremely original.  I especially thought it was profound the way they wrote in an assassin with a hearing problem, who else does this????  No one.  When I heard about Serenity I was both happy and sad since my hopes that a move response would bring the show or at least another movie back.  I didn't think the response from fans would be overwhelming enough.  <br /> <br />Well the Movie by far was above my expectations.  It was sad to see Shepherd go, I think the Ron Glass comeback was great!  But, again, well written and if indeed this is the last of this great creation, Joss did a hell of a job making his lasting mark.  I hope with the response, however, that the open ending he did leave is able to be realized and we see a continuation of this amazing creation. <br /> <br />Thank you Joss for keeping this alive!
0553801503|5.0|This novel is of the same caliber as his other books in the series.  It is full of complex story lines, deep history, and the most believable characters in any book I've read.  Martin continues drawing his gritty, humanized landscape where there is no black and white, only shades of grey.  From the scheming Queen Cersei to the possibly scheming Queen Margaery, from the humbled Kingslayer to the growing Brienne, Martin makes you understand the characters. <br /> <br />People have compared this book with Robert Jordan's fantasy series, likely because it's mostly development of the various plots, presumably laying heavy groundwork for a finale grander than anything seen yet.  If you're a fan of George Martin, this is just another shining example of his writing style.  I've only read the first book in Jordan's series - some memorable moments but all in all I'm surprised I finished it and very glad I stopped reading book 2 after page 3.  It's an insult to Martin to compare his series with Jordan's.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|Finally a Dire Straits best of with no edited versions.  You get full length versions of Tunnel of Love, Telegraph Road & Money For Nothing.  Also included one new song All The Roadrunning with Emmylou Harris.  I think the track listing Amazon has is a little off, because the copy I bought has Skateaway which is finally on a Dire Straits best off.  Like most best off's there are songs that people would like to see on a best of and I'm no exception.  I would like to have seen Twisting By The Pool, Heavy Fuel, Lady Writer, Industrial Disease and Solid Rock on here (my reson for substracting a star).  Otherwise an outstanding Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler collection worth buying.
0792843584|3.0|The movie takes it's time to tell the story and develop the characters. Hopefully with time, the movie will redeem itself. If you did not know that the movie was such a failure at the box office, you would appreciate it more. Overall I would recommend the movie for all fans for westerns. Just be patient through some of the longer scenes. Take in the great western landscape.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have been a fan of creator Joss Weidon since I saw the first episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This man knows how to write. His stuff has a tendancy to pull you in and make you part of his family. Whene I first heard he was starting a new sci-fi series called Firefly I was there from the begining. First eppisode show \\"Train job\\" had me hooked. Sadly the network that asked him to goto them didn't suppoert the project with constant pre-empting, order rearranging, and schedule shifting made for low ratings. The network gave the best show of the year the axe without even giving it a chance to let it grow. Both us the fans and Joss crusaded and fought. We eventually got the series on DVD. (I give that 5 stars to) Still a best seller here at amazon after 2 years. Universal took note, Someone there got it. Thus we get to Serenity. Sorry it took me so long to get here. Best movie of 2005. opening day my friend and I got a group of 12, some fans of the series some newbies, everyone loved it. not like loved. The writing, acting, everything works well. You do not have to see the series to enjoy the film. I just recomend seeing the series 'cause that rocks too. Rent, Borrow a friends copie, or Buy it but SEE THIS MOVIE, it's that good.
B000B8QF14|4.0|As someone who has seen Green Day in concert three times, I was expecting something a little bit better. Although I did enjoy the dvd thoroughly I was expecting to see their entire show that I am used to. The interviews are ok but it would have been nice if they were in a seperate section of the dvd. Also, since Green Day is from the bay area, they should've featured one of their San Francisco concerts instead of the one in London. Their concerts here are always their best shows. The cd is great too!
0740748475|5.0|This set, which contains every Calvin and Hobbes strip ever released, in chronological order, is a work of art--so much so that you won't want to use it to introduce your 10-year old to the wonders of Calvin and Hobbes.  The paper is high-quality, the colors are great, and the strips are everything I remembered.<br /><br />Good comic strips remind us of what we see in ourselves, and from my own perspective these strips have gotten even better with time.  When Watterson started his strip in the mid-80's, I was in college, and Calvin's exploits reminded me a lot of my own as a child.  Perversely, as I grew older, I saw more and more of myself in Calvin's dad, and I revisited the strip a few years ago and got a mild shock as to how far the resemblance went--Calvin's dad, like me, was a patent attorney.  (So, maybe there's hope for Calvin after all).<br /><br />There IS one unfortunate downside to reading this collection.  Bill Watterson had the good sense to end Calvin's run while the strip was still fresh and funny (something Gary Larson should have done), and we are left wanting more.  Alas, there are no  new adventures for the dynamic duo, and the current comic strips available in the paper are a poor substitute for Watterson's humor and insightfulness.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First of all music is personal so all the people that give reviews that are 1 star or such clearly dont like the genre or have beef with the band and just hope to lower there overall average.   <br />This album is great! It has roots back to the older stuff but moves them in a more mature well rounded direction. Musically it sounds much better. If you like rock music i suggest you go buy this album. If you dont like rock then go away your in the wrong place.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|everything about this film is escapist adventure thrills and excitement EXCEPT......that CONFUSING/FRUSTRATING \\"cut\\" between Kong's capture and the first scene (back) in New York City. from the opening credits through the entire Skull Island roller-coaster you will not find a more enjoyable cinema experience. the effects are brilliant, the pacing breath-taking (not counting the first 30 minutes of important \\"background build-up\\") and the interplay between the characters (including Kong) are FULLY realized. TO HIS CREDIT Peter Jackson manages NOT to succumb to \\"cartooning\\" Kong. there are NO \\"Harry and the Hendersons\\" faces or goofy grins or superfluous facial expressions/tears. Kong remains a \\"real\\" (albeit 30 foot) gorilla to the end. the emotion of his love for Ann is STILL obvious (and wonderfully potrayed). BUT THEN there is \\"THAT CUT\\"...that artery-severing KNIFE-SLICE that leaves you thinking that you missed about 20-25 minutes of story! for over 2 hours we get to know our characters (and the dynamics of their inter-twining relationships) quite intimately. SUDDENLY MOST of that ends...and i mean SUDDENLY. Minutes later the film starts to wind to its dramatic Empire State Building finale. it felt like 20 minutes of film had been lost (showing Kong's transport to America and his subsequent humiliation as [basically] a circus/side-show act...longing for his beloved Ann and feeling defeated without her). EVEN WITH ITS FAULTS this is STILL a ROUSING cinematic adventure. the Skull Island escapades are destined to rest amongst the all-time great cinematic thrill sequences and Peter Jackson's love for Kong is evident from the opening scenes to the last frame of film (especially poignant are the moments shared between Kong and Ann on the cliffs at sunset). Stellar performances from the lovely Naomi Watts, the talented Adrian Brody, and (with a few eyebrow-raising exceptions) Jack Black. the performer who deserves the MOST accolades is (of course) Andy Serkis who pulleddouble-duty as Kong AND the entertaining Lumpy The Cook. i think the Oscars needs to add a special category to aknowledge the gifts of \\"motion capture/voice\\" artists like Serkis (his work as Smeagol in LOTR certainly deserved such aknowledgement). ALL IN ALL....an impressive movie going experience destined to ONLY get better on the inevitible \\"Extended Director's Cut DVD\\" (whenever that is released). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just like the series firefly, this is a realistic SciFi adventure without the aliens, monsters and fancy lasers. Good and bad is still between people, same problems and attitudes just in a future setting. <br /> <br />People are just like now but in the future, the western feel, guns, horses, bars,  mixed with the space ships is just realistic. <br /> <br />I love the humor in this, I love the interaction between the characters, they seem just like regular people you would find walking on the street today. <br /> <br />Even people who may not watch SciFi would like this movie with it's down to earth characters and humor. <br /> <br />The movie answered questions from the Firefly series and kept the same feel, fans will be comfortable with the similarities. <br /> <br />New fans will like it as well, it gives enough information at the begining to explain the general story preceding the movie but to really understand the characters new fans really need to go back the check out the series. <br /> <br />This has something for everyone. <br /> <br />I highly recomend this movie A++++++
B00002Z88D|4.0|This is my favorite album to listen to while getting wasted and playing counter-strike on hot summer nights.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|So I guess The Strokes finally got fed up with being called boring, unoriginal, and derivative, huh? Well someone needs to tell them that stealing from different bands instead of the usual suspects (Television, VU, etc.) doesn't make their boring, unoriginal music any better.    This album adds a whole new bag of tricks to the Strokes' arsenal, but none of it works. In fact, it just makes the Strokes' ear-pleasing, but safe, music harder to listen to. I would've preferred another copy of Is This It if it meant I wouldn't have to listen to awful songs like \\"Juicebox\\" and \\"Evening Sun.\\" You just know that some British mag is going to call this album the second coming of the second coming of Jesus Christ (the first being Is This It, or any overhyped album by a \\"The\\" band you can think of) and hype this album beyond belief, but don't buy into it. The Strokes are still the same old one-trick pony, and some added touches and a few tweaks isn't going to save them.    Better luck next time, boys.    P.S. I've noticed a trend on Amazon where people give negative votes to reviews, just because the reviewer doesn't agree with their opinion. Don't vote my review unhelpful just because I don't think this album is the best ever.
B000000OQF|5.0|The year was 1987... Those of us who liked rock had been reduced to swallowing poser hair/glam bands that had made us forget what we liked about hard rock in the first place. The times were filled with bands that cared more about their hairspray than their music, more about being commercial by softening up their sound through keyboards and heavy reverb than to give us something to feel, and more fakery than fool's gold. In the midst of this musical malaise, I remember seeing \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" on MTV. I was so sick of poser bands that at first I dismissed the song and the band as just another LA poser band. I heard the song a couple of more times and I started to think that this band had something that other bands did't have, but I couldn't pin point it. Then I heard \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\". I was impressed at G'n'R's sense of melody and Axl's ability to switch vocal styles so well. MTV kept feeding us more of the same old sugary hard rock until it first aired \\"Paradise City\\". I was immediately hooked on G'n'R after hearing \\"Paradise City\\". The lyrics were intense, the guitar playing was dirty and raucous, and the music had attitude... REAL attitude. G'n'R were bad and they didn't have to tell us: attitude was all over them. Then I bought \\"Appetite for Destruction\\". I skipped \\"Jungle\\" to hear the next track \\"It's So Easy\\". Within the first five seconds of hearing the opening bass line, I got goose bumps. Upon hearing the first verse, I was floored! Axl didn't mess around and didn't mince words. He told it like he saw it and he made us feel his attitude. Crawling through the streets of Hollywood, he could say with credibility \\"It's so easy, when everybody's trying to please me, baby\\". The next song, \\"Nightrain\\" blew me away, yet again. The harmonized rhythm guitars burned. Axl's words again made me think that this guy doesn't THINK he's bad; he IS bad. The many other great songs (Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle, Anything Goes, etc.) were continuous brutal assaults with lyrics such as \\"I get up around 7/Get out of bed around 9/I don't worry about nothing/ `Cause worrying is a waste of my time\\" or \\"Your daddy works in porno now that mommy's not around/She used to love her heroin but no she's underground). After hearing \\"Appetite\\" I remembered what I was missing from rock music: realness, attitude and good music. I must have listened to \\"Appetite\\" at least a hundred times. It's still sounds good to this day. <br /> <br />About a couple of years ago, I was lucky enough to meet Axl by chance at a cigar shop in Santa Monica, CA. Long story short, I had a two hour conversation with him about music, G'n'R, about his new music, other musicians and much more. I found him to be extremely knowledgeable about musical instruments, music in general and about anything that we talked about. Axl was down to earth, intelligent and very cool - nothing like what the media has portrayed him to be. I got to ask him the questions that I wanted to know and I will never forget our conversation.  <br /> <br />G'n'R single handedly brought back the attitude and musicality that was missing in hard rock. If you haven't heard \\"Appetite\\", you don't know what you're missing.  <br />
B000002IGV|5.0|What's the 4-1-1?<br /><br />Twisted Sister labored day in and day out for more than a decade on the New York City club circuit before becoming a household name. When they originally formed in 1972 by guitarist Jay Jay French, the group was a glam cover band in the vein of the New York Dolls. It wasn't until 1976 that wild frontman Dee Snider hooked up with the group. It was Dee that become the chief original songwriter and got Twisted Sister going toward their path of rock stardom.<br /><br />The group's first studio album Under the Blade was a hit by any standard, but it did cause quite a stir in the rock music underground. Atlantic Record released their follow-up album in 1983, You Can't Stop Rock and Roll to mixed reviews. Some say it might have been Quiet Riot's breakout into the pop charts that gave Twisted Sister and bands like them a chance to be heard. In 1984, the group released their third album Stay Hungry. And the rest, they say...is history!<br /><br />Often overlooked is the albums title track \\"Stay Hungry.\\" The song has such a great heavy metal feel and bounce to it as Dee Snider wails away vocally, and his twin guitar attack of Jay Jay French and Eddie Ojeda back him up with a wall of power chords. You know it, you love it, and most of you youngsters think it's a song for a nasal decongestant; it's the rock anthem \\"We're Not Gonna Take It.\\" This is the one that got Twisted Sister noticed; for good and bad reasons.<br /><br />Senator Al Gore's wife Tipper singled out the video for this song for its violent content and the impact it would have on America's youth. Mind you, this video was so cartoonish that if you actually threw someone out a window because of it, you have more problems than listening to Twisted Sister. The controversy only worked in the groups favor, as the album started flying off the shelves. It just goes to show that all publicity is good publicity.<br /><br />\\"Burn in Hell\\" never makes the Twisted Sister best of albums, but it's actually on of their coolest tracks. The tone is very dark and evil as you are taken into the bowels of hell. Once inside, the guitars ring out in a metal fury and summon the flames of Hades. I was actually introduced to this song when it appeared in Pee Wee's Big Adventure (yeah, I didn't believe it either). \\"Horror-Teria\\" eventually went on to spawn Snider's feature film Strangeland years later. The two-part track is just as twisted as the movie (okay, the movie was much more so).<br /><br />Twisted Sister showed they were no slouches when it came to the anthem department with the inclusion of \\"I Wanna Rock.\\" This is another song that has bleed so much into our pop-culture that a version of it was used in the SpongeBob Squarepants Movie (sung lovingly by Dee himself). \\"The Price\\" was a heavy metal ballad tried and true. It's not too sappy, but it's heartfelt at the same time. Thunderous riffs run rampant on \\"The Beast.\\" When the axes are subdued, drummer A.J. Pero takes over. Now what I can't understand is, everyone knows what \\"S.M.F.\\" stands for after listening to it, but it was We're Not Gonna Take It\\" that Tipper had a problem with.<br /><br />Twisted Sister went on to release several more albums, but none lived up to Stay Hungry. In reality, Twisted Sister wasn't the biggest hard rock act in the world, but they did make their mark on the scene for a few years. The group called it quits in the late eighties. Jay Jay French went on to manage Sevendust and Snider worked any gig he could get. He formed three groups, Desperado, Widowmaker, and S.M.F. (a TS cover band), and hosted his own radio talk show as well as the syndicated program the House of Hair. Twisted Sister has since reunited and has decided to hit to nostalgia circuit. They've been crossing the country for the past few years and continue to keep the pace. Why? Because you wanna rock!<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />It's not the greatest rock album of all-time, but you can't discuss the history of rock and metal without mentioning it.f rock and metal without mentioning it.
B000244FDW|4.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" must be in want of a great Mr. Darcy. On that score David Rintoul is the weak link in the BBC's 1980 mini-series, which provides one of the most faithful adaptations of Jane Austen's novel to date.  The role of Fitzwilliam Darcy is tricky because we have to agree with Elizabeth Bennet's harsh judgment that he is the personification of pride early on, be surprised when he offers the most backhanded proposal in English literature, and then warm towards him as Lizzie's opinion change and her affections follow.  On the basis of that transformation rather than on his good looks I still favor Colin Firth in the 1995 BBC as the best Darcy of the bunch having seen six of the ten dating back to the 1938 television version that aired two years before the 1940 MGM movie with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  There is one moment in this mini-series where Rintoul's Darcy lets down his guard, and his eyebrows, and it is for but a brief scene.  The difference between the haughty Mr. Darcy we meet at the beginning and the happy romantic we are supposed to see at the end is so minimal that you might not even see it.<br /><br />The rest of the cast fulfills our expectations of the characters in the novel, although I would say that I thought Elizabeth (Elizabeth Garvie) was the best looking one of the Bennet daughters, an honor that is supposed to obviously go to her older sister, Jane (Sabina Frakyln).  But since we are supposed to love Lizzie the best, this is a minor point of contention.  Mr. Bennet (Moray Watson) is still long suffering, Mrs. Bennet (Priscilla Morgan) is insufferable, and I still want to shake some sense into Lydia (Natalie Ogle) from the moment she first appears.  As soon as I recognized Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh I knew that was a spot-on casting.  I especially liked Tessa Peake-Jones as Mary Bennet and Irene Richard as Charlotte Lucas, which made up for finding Malcolm Rennie's Mr. Collins too much the buffoon.  Director Cyril Coke filmed on location in the beautiful English countryside and certainly focuses on capturing all of the nuances of 18th century life among the gentry.<br /><br />The strength of the production is its overall fidelity to Austen's novel, although I was a bit worried at first when screenwriter Fay Weldon took the novel's famous opening line, split it between Jane and Lizzie, and starting to work in the rest of the opening exposition as dialogue.  But then Mrs. Bennet bursts in and we are clearly on track.  All things considered this is the most restrained version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that I have seen to date, wherein Mr. Bennet and his two eldest daughters most closely match the Bingleys and Darcys of this world in terms of calm restraint.  I really like the 2005 theatrical version of the story because it is crystal clear to me when Darcy falls for Elizabeth and when she falls for him, and I have to say that in this BBC production you really have to wait to hear the words come out of their mouths and then you are not particularly inclined to believe either one of them.  Still, so much of the familiar dialogue Austen wrote made it into this one that it is worth sitting through the entire 265 minutes of the five-part mini-series at least once if you are an Austen fan.  Final Note: This is the version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that is included in the BBC's \\"Jane Austen Collection\\" of DVDs, which is how I finally got to check it out (and as soon as it was over my oldest daughter and I went to the theater to watch the Keira Knightley version again).Malcolm Rennie's Mr. Collins too much the buffoon.

0385510454|4.0|this is a very entertaining book and quick read
0553801503|4.0|Once I re-introduced myself to all the characters and various family trees this one slipped on like a pair of favorite shoes. Would have to say that the 're-aquainting' took about 100 pages with lots and lots of back and forth flipping to the appendix of families in the back - it was worth the effort though. This is an enjoyable addition to the series, and frankly the lack of storyline on some of the other characters (they'll be in the next book) was not a bad thing.  The story moved along a bit faster and you bobble back to a prior story line sooner (satisfying some of that 'what happens next?!' issue). I'm not going to mind in the least backing up in the time line to read book 5 (but will have to probably re-acquaint myself all over again by the time it's released). This is a well written series - I highly recommend it.
B000000OQF|5.0|What's the 4-1-1?<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the history and present of Guns N' Roses. If you're reading this, chances are you know the deal. L.A. band comes out of nowhere and hits one out of the park with their debut release Appetite for Destruction. They garner fame and fortune, release several more successful albums, self-destruct due to personality clashes, and break-up just as fast as they arrived.<br /><br />Now the singer is crazy, locked-up in an asylum (his mansion), claiming to release the damn near eight-years-in-the-making new Guns N' Roses album with a completely different line-up (even different from the last time he teased you with it). The rest of the group goes on to do their own thing, while most notably Slash goes on to guest on every album that will have him, and then forms Velvet Revolver. Now you're up to speed if you forgot.<br /><br />When this album first came out there was so much mystique and hype behind it. I remember hearing crazy stories of each member. I can recall hearing that Slash was wanted in seven states and that was the reason why he wore the hat, had the hair in his face, and changed his name. Yeah, it's ridiculous, but I we were in fifth grade.<br /><br />In a time when pop and dance music controlled the charts, when you hear the opening riff and the main riffs that dominate \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" it made you want to say, `to hell with pop music, this is where it's at!' \\"Jungle\\" more or less became the anthem of the rock culture at the time, and it still remains powerful today. Axl switches up his vocals to a more deep tone for the dark rocker \\"It's So Easy.\\" As a kid it was a thrill to hear the F-word in a song. It wasn't something that happened a lot. Even though it was harmless, to an eleven year old, it was sort of taboo.<br /><br />Slash & Izzy lay down some great riff patterns for the ultra heavy \\"Nightrain.\\" Let's not forget Steven Adler's crazy cow bell action either. The sweet chugga-chugga guitar tones of \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" still ring out loud and clear today. I had no idea what this was about when back in the day, but as the years progressed, it made more sense. \\"Paradise City\\" was the track that really broke Guns N' Roses into the mainstream. Looking back it doesn't surprise me either; it has a real pop-vibe to appeal to the non-rock crowd, but still manages to stay heavy enough to captivate their core audience.<br /><br />\\"My Michelle\\" has one of those choruses, that for some reason, you're compelled to sing along with; even trying to match Axl's odd voice inflections. Now most rock bands appeal to a predominately male audience, but to combat that tactic, Guns delivers \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" I can't even begin to tell you how many girls in my class fell in love with that song and Axl Rose because of it. I've always thought that \\"Rocket Queen\\" never got the praise it deserved. It really displays each member's expertise during various parts of the six minute composition.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Appetite for Destruction still blows me away.

B000002H70|5.0|A timeless masterpiece that never fades or fails to seduce.
B000BW7QX6|4.0|But, this film was very well done. <br /> <br />If you've never seen \\"Firefly\\" (which was the case for me), the movie catches you up to speed fairly well in the first few minutes. There are things that I felt like I missed because I didn't watch the show, but Whedon goes out of his way to make sure that everyone will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />And enjoyed it and there are some good scenes, and I am not usually a sci-fi fan (with the exception of the outstanding, \\"Fifth Element,\\" which is like this movie in that it's not all about the action or the genre, but there are actual human elements to the characters and a good dose of humor sprinkled into the mix). <br /> <br />The story itself is message oriented, without feeling like you're being beaten over the head for it, and as already stated, the humorous moments were a bit wrecked since most of them are shown in the trailer of the movie. <br /> <br />The acting is well, for the film. Because the entire case of the television show is brought back for the movie, they've developed a great rapport and a style that shows they genuinely care about each other as actors and characters. This leads to all kind of great moments in which the characters interact almost as family, which is the whole point of the story, that this family is on the run and will do anything for each other. There are a few things in the film that are a bit confusing, not so confusing that you won't understand the story but you might just have to re-think it twice. I was expecting to see a little bit more buttkicking from the girl, River instead she just fights in two moments of the movie. The plot very oddly, was very similar to Resident Evil: Apocalypse which was also a great film. The only bad thing about this film, is the plot was a bit too stretched and it took a small tad of time to realize what they were doing. Overall This movie deserves a 4/5 and was very nice. I actually bought it. If you did like this film I highly recommend: Resident Evil: Apocalypse

Along with CC doing their thing and Boy George handling the  lead vocals in his \\"Smokey Robinson meets Sylvester\\" way,  there was the excellent and soulful wailings of Helen Terry  throughout (why she never got offered a deal is beyond me!)  and the late Jermaine Stewart in the background!

630521610X|4.0|With huge success throughout the 1980's with numerous horror hits, such as, \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\", \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\", and \\"A New Nightmare\\", in the mid-nineties, director Wes Craven returned to the genre that he knows best.  Though it seemed that Wes had nothing else to give in the franchise, by any original means that is, he along with writer Kevin Williamson have managed to completely rejuvenate the dying horror franchise, with a sense of freshness and originality, all the while poking fun at what had made the genre so successful.  With the help of up-and-coming acting talents, such as Neve Campbell (TV's \\"Party of Five\\") and Courtney Cox (TV's \\"Friends\\"), it didn't take long for people to realize that this latest Wes Craven film, \\"Scream\\", was far and above anything coming out of the horror genre in recent years, and was to change the horror landscape for years to come. <br /> <br />\\"Scream\\" is set in a sleepy town called Woodsboro, where everything seems perfectly peaceful and serene, that is until a murder is committed.  With the police left with no clues as to who is behind this tragedy, another murder occurs, and another, leaving the community convinced they are under siege by a serial killer.  However, when the killer targets a local girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), it appears she will be just another notch on the killers belt, but with a stroke of luck Sidney escapes with her life, and is now the focus of the public media circus, led by reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) surrounding this killer's rampage.  With this new spotlight shown on her, Sidney is revealed to have been responsible for putting a man behind bars who claims he'd been framed for the murder of Sidney's mother, and evidence is pointing to the possibility that maybe this new serial killer is linked to Sidney's horrific past.  Now, it seems that maybe this man, Cotton Weary (Liev Shrieber), wasn't lying after all, and that maybe her mother's killer is still out there.  Butfinding the killer will prove to be no small task as everyone in this small town are suspects, and no one appears to be safe from the killer's wrath. <br /> <br />With the release of \\"Scream\\", both director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, were thrust back into Hollywood popularity.  Audiences just loved the somewhat campy dialogue, and tongue-in-cheek humor that the duo imbued into the movie, and the non-stop twists were enough to keep everyone on the edge of their seats with anticipation.  It was for the most part a great film, but there are however a few complaints I have with some aspects of the film.  The acting was good from the cast of Hollywood's young stars, but sometimes the dialogue should have been handled in a more mature way than just your average television show script (this problem is especially evident when Skeet Ulrich is speaking).  The gore is very present in this horror movie, which is to be expected for the genre, however at times it did seem that director Wes Craven was trying extra hard to be as gory as he could be.  I don't know if he did this to satisfy some morbid sense of accomplishment for himself to include as much blood and guts as possible, or if that is what he thought would guarantee butts in the seats, either way the ploy didn't bother most people and \\"Scream\\" had plenty of return business.   <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Scream\\" is an entertaining horror film, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end, though sometimes too heavy on the gore, it sure beats some of the other horror films that had previously been released. <br /> <br />\\"Scream\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.
0743454537|3.0|Three stars because it IS a page-turner- I couldn't put it down. Some of the prose was beautiful. A lot of it though... I felt read a little bit like a TV mini-series. I don't know how to adequately phrase this, but there was something very repetitive about her cadence. So many chapters had the same structure that it became formulaic. <br /> <br />In addition, I agree with the reviewer above that every single narrative sounded like the same voice. If Picoult was going to use 6 voices, they should have sounded distinct. If she couldn't make them distinct, she should have only used one. I especially agree that Anna did not sound 13, except when the others were describing her. Her own voice is clear, and it contradicts her actions. It was disorienting. Perhaps Picoult was trying to enforce that there can be many different perspectives on bioethical issues- if that was her aim, though, she failed. <br /> <br />However, the one thing that ruined it all was the ending. For all of these complexities to be fleshed out and hashed over for 350 some-odd pages, and then to have a tragic fairy tale ending like that? Unbelievable. Is this about medical morals or about fate? Because honestly, it was an almost biblical ending that led me to think, what was she trying to do with this story? And why does she change her tack at the very end? She made almost a Jesus figure out of Anna, which disgusted me so much that I didn't even bother to read the last chapter. It would have been much better if she'd been able to pick a side- or kept us guessing. It didn't really need to be concluded after the court case, maybe a scene with the sisters (then again, maybe that would have accentuated its TV-movie-of-the-week feel). Still, anything else would have been better. (As a slight aside, since the book ends shortly after the really bad event that everyone's avoiding describing directly, it only intensifies the feeling that Anna has always been an afterthought to her parents. Throughout the book, a little nagging voice in the back of my head kept saying, \\"maybe this is just a story about really bad parenting, that parents really DO have favorites\\", and the abrupt description of the aftermath did me no favors in this regard.) <br /> <br />In support of the book, I'll close by saying that it really says something that I was so upset about the ending. She did something right, obviously, because I really was rooting for all the characters.
B000BP86OG|1.0|The Good<br /><br />\\"One Way Ticket\\" is lead by one of those simple riffs that tend to get caught in your head for days, similar to an AC/DC one. The chorus is quite catchy and vocalist Justin Hawkins doesn't sound as irritating as it has in the past (don't get used to it). \\"Knockers\\" may or may be about what you're dirty mind is thinking about, but I highly doubt it. The lyrics are quite cryptic, but the bluesy rhythms and guitar licks are what make the track enjoyable. \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\" recalls classic AOR arena rockers sonically. Hawkins throws in plenty of his trademark falsettos and lays down one fiery solo. This, my friends, is when our trip into hell begins...<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Take everything you remember about The Darkness and throw it out the window. On their first album the group tried to bring back the glitz and glam of eighties power pop and glam metal, on this album that take a few steps back; creating more of a seventies pop rock/eighties AOR sound (remember when KISS went disco?). The music itself sounds great, but the main problem remains to be vocalist Justin Hawkins. He just can't sing. He has his moments here and there, but with each passing track he becomes more and more annoying. Maybe if he focused more on singing in key, the songs would be a lot better. It also seems like there was not a lot of effort put into writing the material.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />They ain't kidding; this is a trip into hell. The only way back is to hit the eject button.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Many of the people who went to see this movie in theatres originally were the die hard book fans, but of course, this wasn't everyone.  After reading the books I must say that Peter Jackson and his team did a fantastic job of casting, special effects, and keeping Tolkien's masterpiece alive.  I was very impressed with this movie.  Everything is fantastic, but it is not for the faint of heart, as the battle scenes are pretty intense.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed!

B00003CXAA|5.0|The mafia is a subject matter that has long held sway over the imaginations of both Hollywood and general movie audiences.  Generally every time Hollywood decides to tackle the mob as subject matter for another movie, it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be plenty of money brought in at the box office.  Successful mafia-themed movies are among some of the best films Hollywood has ever produced.  Ranging from Martin Scorcese's classics, \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Casino\\", to Sam Mendes' \\"Road to Perdition\\", and even on TV with HBO's \\"The Sopranos\\", and Mario Puzo's \\"The Last Don\\" and \\"The Last Don 2\\".  But out of all of these movies or TV shows, one trilogy of movies that will forever be regarded as the best of the best in terms of mafia films, and also 3 of the best films ever made would be `The Godfather' trilogy, directed by renowned director Francis Ford Coppola (\\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Dracula\\"), and written by brilliant novelist Mario Puzo.  The following will be a summary of all three films in the trilogy, and then an overall analysis of the trilogy. <br /> <br />\\"The Godfather\\" focuses on the fictional Corleone mafia family.  Led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), with his oldest son Sonny (James Caan), middle son Freddo who is running family operations in Las Vegas, and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Corleone family struggles to fight its way through the dark world of organized crime.  Set in the years following World War 2, Don Vito Corleone is offered a chance for his family to embark in the drug trade, however, drugs are a vice that Vito believes will lead to the downfall of the mafia.  As Vito declines the opportunity, a decision though smart, will prove to be extremely costly to both him and his family.  As battle lines are drawn between the Corleone's and the other families in New York who feel the Corleone's are causing a rift in their power, all out mafia war is inevitable.  And one thing is for certain no one will escape unscathed.  As the mafia war begins, and casualties begin to pile up not only on the Corleone side of the war, but also on that of the other family's, it is clear that new blood will need to be brought in for victory to be assured.  Though he tried to stay out of his family's dark business, the youngest Corleone son Michael (Al Pacino) must now choose his destiny, to take his rightful place by his father's side or live a life on the right side of the law.  This decision will prove to be the deciding factor in not only the mafia war, but also Michael's happiness in life, but which is more important to him? <br /> <br />\\"The Godfather Part 2\\" begins shortly after the climactic ending to the mafia war, as Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now head of the Corleone family, with one time consigliere turned family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), are now assisting his brother Freddo with operations in Las Vegas.  As Michael continues to run the family business according to his father's last wishes, he is slowly getting the Corleone family into legitimate business and out of the dark mafia underworld.  When a botched assassination attempt is made on Michael's life, he quickly realizes that escaping from this dark life will be more difficult than he thought.  As Michael searches for answers as to who is behind the attempt on his life, he is growing increasingly darker and angrier, causing a rift to form between he and his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton).  Feeling betrayed by his increasingly estranged wife, and fearing that she may not be the only person close to him that is being treacherous, Michael will stop at nothing to maintain his power.  However, this quest along with his family's power may be in jeopardy as the United States government has set their collective sights on bringing down the Corleone family empire. <br /> <br />\\"The Godfather Part 3\\" takes place approximately 10 to 20 years after the events of \\"The Godfather Part 2\\".  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still head of the Corleonefamily, and though he vowed to bring his family into the realm of legitimate business, he is just now in the twilight of his life, succeeding in leaving the dark world of the mafia behind.  Michael in hopes of clearing his family's name in the public realm is becoming more involved in the Catholic Church, however his generosity is not enough to convince his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton) or rival mobsters that Michael and the rest of the Corleone family are legitimate.  On the chance that Michael is relinquishing the Corleone family power, another mafia head wants to take the place of the Corleone's power vacuum.  Fearing that this will end badly for the Corleone's, Michael's nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia) convinces Michael to assist him in thwarting this rival family.  Try as he may to escape the life that has consumed him, Michael is drawn back in to the conflict, and this time the consequences of his actions both past and present, may be more than he can possibly bear. <br /> <br />`The Godfather' trilogy is a triumphant piece of American cinema, expertly crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola.  Most fans of the movies feel that the first film is the best, with the second movie possibly equal to its greatness, and the third being a disappointment.  Personally, I love the entire trilogy, and feel that they are all equal to each other.  As movies, only the first film can truly stand alone, but I just find the journey of Michael Corleone over the course of the trilogy is so powerful, yet tragic.  No matter how hard he tries to make things right for himself and his family, Michael can never escape the life of a mobster.  The first film we find a young, idealistic Michael untouched by the darkness that plagues his father's life, though it appears that darkness is Michael's destiny.  By the end of \\"The Godfather\\", Michael has begun to embrace the dark life he has chosen in order to save his family, and in \\"The Godfather Part 2\\" the darkness has completely consumed Michael.  Everywhere he turns is betrayal and heartbreak, no matter how hard he tries to fight it the darkness within him is consuming all of the great things he once held dear in his life.  \\"The Godfather Part 3\\" is basically a redemption tale for Michael, as he begins to seek forgiveness and peace of mind from the sins of his past.  Hoping that with redemption will come a chance at a new life filled with the love he had before the darkness consumed him.   <br /> <br />Anyone who is a fan of mobster movies, and has never seen `The Godfather' trilogy, are doing a serious disservice to himself or herself.  The casting for these films were terrific, from Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, no filmmaker could ask for a more talented cast of actors/actresses.  One of the biggest standout parts of the trilogy occurs in \\"The Godfather Part 2\\" when Robert De Niro portrays the early days of Vito Corleone as he grows up in the streets of New York to eventually become the head of his own crime family.  De Niro's performance is uncanny when compared to Brando's performance as Don Vito in \\"The Godfather\\"; Francis Ford Coppola's casting of De Niro was perfection.   <br /> <br />Though, in some ways `The Godfather' trilogy, along with all mafia movies, glorify the life of mobsters, there is no escaping when viewing the entire trilogy and all of the heartbreak that is dealt to almost every character in the films, that this lifestyle is not a wise one to choose. <br /> <br />\\"The Godfather\\" is rated R for violence, brief language, and brief nudity/sexuality. <br />\\"The Godfather Part 2\\" is rated R for violence and language. <br />\\"The Godfather Part 3\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief sensuality.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|As one of the year's last major rock releases, System Of A Down sure helped close 2005 with a bang by releasing \\"Hypnotize,\\" the second half to their two-part album. \\"Mezmerize,\\" the first half, was released this past Spring and was such a great album that it had me pumped to hear what else the guys had in store for us. \\"Hypnotize\\" does not disappoint and definitely helps take System Of A Down to the next level, musically and professionally. I remember when they first came out, nobody knew what to make of them and they hardly got any positive press. Today, the tables have turned, as System Of A Down have become one of the most respected rock bands of the new millennium. You can't open up any music/entertainment magazine without seeing something about them. As of 2005, System Of A Down have successfully infected the mainstream. And what a way to do so.<br /><br />The first handful of songs, \\"Attack,\\" \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Kill Rock N' Roll\\" do well to get the blood pumping, while not straying too far from System's signature sound. The title track and first single, \\"Hypnotize\\" is one of the most simple, yet beautiful songs System Of A Down have written to date, and from there it's a bit more challenging. I gotta admit, the first few times I listened to this, I was a bit indifferent to what I had heard. A lot of songs on here, such as \\"Lonely Day\\" and \\"She's Like Heroine\\" (which are Daron-dominant tracks) simply aren't instant hits, but glue themselves to your brain after a while. However, severe adsurdity prevails in \\"Vicinity Of Obscenity\\" which will defnitely make you feel at home. The closing track, \\"Soldier Side\\" is a continuation of the opening track on \\"Mezmerize\\" and serves as an epic closer to this piece, and the perfect way to connect both albums. Because afterall, they are one in the same.<br /><br />Of course, everyone has preferences as to which part they like better. Personally, I'm still stuck on \\"Mezmerize\\" and probably will be for a long time. However, put 'em together, and you get one hell of an album. Surely, they could have cut out a few tracks here and there and released this all as one album, but who cares. It was worth the wait and worth the money. System Of A Down never disappoint, and if you were mezerized by \\"Mezmerize,\\" then \\"Hypnotize\\" is definitely a worthy trip.ut 'em together, and you get one hell of an album.

B00003CXI1|1.0|First of all, if I had never read the books I probably would have liked the movie, but because I have there is only one thing that can be said.  This movie is pathetic.  The books are fantastic and the descriptions are vivid and everything seems real.  Dudley was supposed to be a real jerk and someone who made Harry's life dreadful, but the movie turned him into a pansy.  Same with the Dursleys, they were supposed to be awful too, and they were not scary at all.  The casting in this movie is dreadful with the exception of Severus Snape who truly could not have been better cast.  Even if I could forgive Hollywood for messing up The Dursleys, their interpretation of Dumbledore and Voldemort is unforgivable.  Dumbledore was a feeble old man with no mystery, no sparkle, none of the charm Rowling gave him.  Pathetic, yet again.  HORRIBLY DONE!  Voldemort, geez, I could have drawn him better when I was five.  They lead you up to this big unveiling of the fearsome Lord Voldemort, the ruthless killer of hundreds of people, and he looks like a mushroom.  That is dreadful...  I mean that would strike fear into the hearts of gee.  No one?  The characters are poorly cast, the plot is weak, and the special effects are in a word: AWFUL.  I couldn't have been more disappointed with this.  Honestly, J.K. Rowling hands Warner Brothers a best selling book, and THIS is what they came up with???  Utter garbage.  Want to see a real movie, watch Lord of the Rings because at the very least it did not disgrace Tolkien.  If you haven't read the books and don't intend to prior to watching this movie, well then, you'd enjoy it.  But if you have read the books, Stay away from this trash because it is not worth your money.  Not a cent.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Possibly this wildly talented band's very best album ever.  Certainly one of the gems of 2005, \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\" is nearly an hour of unrelentless, skilled and soulful musicmaking.  I owned the album for a few months, checking out one song and then another, but not until I just hit \\"play\\" and let the whole thing go did I get the full effect of how brilliantly this album is produced.  Once heard in this manner, you won't be able to \\"eat just one\\" anymore.  There isn't a bad song, in fact, the thing gains in strength, track-by-ever-luvin'-track.  The true test was when I found my no longer young body thrashing about the room like I was 22 again.  Clutch's sound remains unique and it's amazing to me how far they've come, how well they've done, how respected they are - and still so few know who the hell they are!   <br /> <br />Get this disc.  Now! <br />
B000001FC0|5.0|When I listen to this album, I am taken back to the days  of \\"Miami Vice\\", \\"Friday Night Videos\\", \\"Wiseguy\\" and  other 80's pop identifiers that make me wax nostalgic!  This album was everywhere in 1985!  \\"Shout\\", \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\"  still stand the test of time almost 22 yrs later!   It sold like 11 million worldwide to date..  so one can't go wrong here!
6305903182|4.0|With the success of \\"Scream\\", and the even bigger success of \\"Scream 2\\", it really comes as no surprise that director Wes Craven would return one more time to the surviving characters from Woodsboro, and finish his trilogy of terror with the release of the final chapter, \\"Scream 3\\".  But without writer Kevin Williamson by his side, can Wes Craven's \\"Scream 3\\" really live up to its predecessors? <br /> <br />After the terrible events that occurred around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in Woodsboro in \\"Scream\\", and the mayhem that followed Sidney to her college campus in \\"Scream 2\\", now to protect herself and the ones she loves, Sidney has gone into hiding via self-imposed exile.  However, on the Hollywood set of `Stab 3', the movie series based on the events that occurred on those tragic days in Woodsboro, the cast members begin dropping like flies in the same order as their characters are written to die in the film.  With these recent murders and suspicions rising, Sidney comes out of hiding to help her fellow Woodsboro survivors, deputy Dewey (David Arquette), who is now a bodyguard for one of the actresses on the film `Stab 3', and his former lover/news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette).  Just when they thought they knew the rules of the game, this new killer has come along and broken those rules.  And this time no one is going to be safe. <br /> <br />\\"Scream 3\\" rejoins the three main characters from the previous two films for one final time, along with director Wes Craven, sadly writer Kevin Williamson opted out of this final chapter.  The acting was about equal to the caliber of \\"Scream 2\\", which means that the acting continued to be fairly solid all around.  The gore, just as it was in the second film, was not as over-the-top as \\"Scream\\", but did seem to be a little more evident than it did in \\"Scream 2\\".  The story was still full of twists and turns, with plenty of thrills to go around, plus plenty of comedy to break up the dark proceedings.  Sadly, the humor sometimes takes front-and-center, leaving the drama in the background.  This problem, in my opinion, is based on the fact that Kevin Williamson chose not to return, though he had his share of problems finding a decent blend of humor and drama in \\"Scream\\", he skillfully mixed the two in his second outing with \\"Scream 2\\".  Some other aspects of \\"Scream 3\\" that were a little weak, most notably the clues being left at the scene of every murder were a little too convenient, and the actors playing parts in `Stab 3' were a little too unrealistically stupid, which made for plenty of humor but added to the dumbing down of this franchise. <br /> <br />Overall, not as strong as the second installment, yet still above the first film in terms of storytelling and execution (no pun intended).  \\"Scream 3\\" is a successful and enjoyable conclusion to Wes Craven's trilogy of terror, but I would have preferred that writer Kevin Williamson would have stuck around for this final act. <br /> <br />\\"Scream 3\\" is rated R for violence and language.
630445841X|5.0|The recent edition of the book is interesting in that two of the three novellas in it have been made into movies, Revenge, and Legends of the Fall.<br /><br />I'll go on record saying that although I enjoyed the movie, I thought the book was better, although it's not really that long a book. Still, even in a work this short, there are depths that can't really be explored in a 2-hour movie, so if you liked the movie, I would strongly recommend you read the book.<br /><br />But I did enjoy the movie. I don't know if it's a great movie or not, but I found it oddly engrossing and with a very poignant ending. Of course, any movie with Anthony Hopkins in it is a plus, but I think the other brothers and actors did a fine job with their roles too, including Brad Pitt.<br /><br />In the book, Harrison has a direct but poetic style, and his male characters are well-drawn and believable. The women don't have much of a role in his books, but I don't mind that really. Harrison is a writer about old-fashioned masculine virtues and ideals of the sort that perhaps don't exist in our society anymore. But if you want equally well-developed women characters, you'll need to look elsewhere.
B00009IEDC|5.0|Yes, like the second review I don't know what Bjork (or whatever) is listening to that he gave such a bad review.  Amy Lee is comparable to who?  Evanescence is comparable to what other band when it comes to writing the music, adding the accompaniment, etc?  Seems maybe Bjork needs to GET A TV so he can review and be let in on better music and have something to compare them to.
0783232039|4.0|Yes I am that sad. I've looked up the dolls online, but they look all wrong. I want THE doll from the film. Boo.<br /><br />Bride Of Chucky more than made up for the slow film-by-numbers that was Childs Play 3. I'm so glad they decided to make another sequel (and then another), instead of just leaving it after Childs Play 3. I think that would have ruined the whole series. So far, this is the best Childs Play movie I've seen - but I haven't seen Seed Of Chucky yet. Chucky was at his best yet, looking suitably evil, complete with black stitching. The film looks up with the introduction of Jennifer Tilly, looking every inch a life size evil Barbie, as an ex of Charles Lee Ray's who brings him back, only for him to kill her, and bring her back as one of her many dolls that she collects. With plenty of cleavage shots for the guys, Jennifer is certainly an asset to this.<br /><br />And I loved the Tiffany doll! She is so cute. Dyed blonde hair, black leather jacket over a wedding dress, black nail varnish and black chunky boots. And lashings of black eyeliner. Sounds like my kinda gal. There's also a very surreal sex scene between Chucky & Tiffany, including Tiffany asking him if he should be wearing rubber, when he's made of rubber. (Still doesn't work though.)<br /><br />Katherine Heigl was also terrific, although her boyfriend in the film is rather pointless. She looks remarkably like a darker blonde Julia Stiles in this.<br /><br />There's a few references to other horror movies in this, including: Jason Voorhees hockey mask from the Friday the 13th films, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series & Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise, clips of Bride of Frankenstein and a couple of references to Scream, and who can forget the Hellraiser scene?<br /><br />There's a great few one-liners in this, mainly by Chucky, but Tiffany gets a word in edgeways sometimes. Here's, in my opinion, the best:<br /><br />Tiffany: A woman spends all day over a hot stove slaving away for her man. The least he can do is the dishes.<br /><br />Chucky: I give them six months, three if she gains weight.<br /><br />Jesse: How'd you end up like this?<br /><br />Tiffany: It's a long story.<br /><br />Chucky: If this were a movie, it would take three or four sequels to do it justice. (ha!)<br /><br />Spelling Computer: Spell \\"woman\\".<br /><br />Spelling Computer: B-I-T-C-H. That is incorrect. The correct spelling of woman in \\"W-O-M...<br /><br />Chucky: Shows how much you know.<br /><br />Tiffany: I wouldn't marry you if you had the body of G.I. Joe.<br /><br />Chucky: Hey Raggedy Ann, have you looked in the mirror lately? Now's not the time to get picky.<br /><br />Chucky: Any man would need a hunk of plastic PROBABLY battery operated to get a reaction out of you in bed.<br /><br />Tiffany: Take it from me, honey, plastic is no substitute for a nice hunk of wood.<br /><br />I officially love this film now, and I'll keep my eye out for THE Tiffany doll from the film. It's so cute. Oh, and listen out for a fabulous version of Patsy Cline's \\"Crazy\\" by the Kidney Thieves (charming name).

B000002LK1|5.0|This album is DM's tour de force offering in my opinion<br />and the first album I ever bought by them.<br />Sonically, the remastered version is the bomb!!<br />I find myself coming back and listening to this album<br />at least 2 or 3 times per month. In a lot of ways,<br />it's still very current sounding!<br /><br />**\\"Songs Of Faith & Devotion\\" (1993) is my second favorite,<br />followed by \\"Exciter\\" (2001) and more recently,<br />the live CD/DVD \\"Touring The Angel\\" followed later!<br /><br />\\"The World In My Eyes\\", \\"Sweetest Perfection\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Policy Of Truth\\",<br />\\"Clean\\" and all the others still stand up and make my head bob & I get \\"the funk face\\" big time!

B00005NRO3|4.0|After becoming a phenomenal hit with young, and even some older, movie audiences with \\"Scream\\", Wes Craven was beginning to come under immense pressure to top himself with a much anticipated sequel.  Dimension films being smart enough to know that this is one horror franchise that if handled correctly could prove to be very profitable and entertaining, lobbied hard to get both director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson back for the sequel.  Upon accomplishing this task, and also the task of bringing back the acting talents for the surviving characters from the first film, the production crews for \\"Scream 2\\" were up and running at full speed.    \\"Scream 2\\" finds young Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) going to college, and trying to put her horrific past behind her.  Try as she may, with the release of a movie based on the events that engulfed Sidney's life in Woodsboro, Sidney once again is forced to face her tragic life.  Just when the movie madness is dying down, murders begin to occur on Sidney's college campus, and it appears that someone is setting out to make a real-life sequel to the events in Woodsboro.  With history repeating itself, news reporter Gail Weathers (Courney Cox), Woodsboro's own deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and a couple of other survivors from the original film, are back to try to save themselves and prove their innocence.    Any complaints or worries anyone had about a sequel to \\"Scream\\" have but to watch \\"Scream 2\\" and realize that they had nothing to worry about.  Everything that was great about the original movie has been maintained and improved upon for the sequel.  Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson have once again crafted a very clever web of suspicion and murder, that will entangle you and never let go until the credits roll.  All of the complaints I had about the first film being to gory and a little too immature in places have been corrected.  The gore factor appears to be lowered, as Wes Craven seems to be restraining himself to some extent with the murder sequences, and all of the dialogue is handled with maturity and care.  All of the actors are terrific, the plot twists are once again very unique, and will catch you completely off guard.  The characters are all thoroughly engaging, but sadly not all of your favorite characters will survive to the end.    Overall, \\"Scream 2\\" is yet another thrill a minute movie from Wes Craven that tops its predecessor and will leave you absolutely wanting more.    \\"Scream 2\\" is rated R for violence and language.

B000002UVX|5.0|Not only was I privileged to see Jimi perform New Year's Eve 1969 from the 5th row at the Filmore East, but also drove him back to his hotel that evening. I had seen Jimi perform many times, but I could tell from that evening's performance that Jimi was onto something on a higher plane. Gone were the theatrics and in its place was music at its purist form. Had Jimi lived, I'm sure he would have merged jazz, blues, soul and rock into a new art form. It was an \\"electric\\" performance and this album captures a moment in time of Jimi at his peak.
0307276902|4.0|This was a interesting/good book, not a great book, because of the subject matter, a sad book, an inspiring book.  Having never been into the drinking and drug culture, it was heavy, and sad to think about those who have lived this life.  I plan on having my 15 year old son read the book to let him see where the use of drugs and alcohol can lead.  If this can help even a few people avoid this spiral of life events, I believe James Frey will have done some good by sharing his life story. <br />It was an amazing book, and a sorrowful book, to know of the millions of people living thur this.  James has come such a long way, and should be proud of himself, I am proud of him.
B00025ETIW|1.0|My Chemical Romance is probably the best hybrid of the Cure, Sisters Of Mercy, and the voice of Geddy Lee on vocals that I've probably heard in my relatively short life.  Actually a hybrid such as that sounds pretty good, but My Chemical Romance is a far cry of the comparison I've put on paper, or the internet.  As I've said MCR (I'm going to do initials because every time I see an emo kid's wet dream for a name I want to cringe) comes across as a bit of a parody of the Cure and Sisters of Mercy (who definitely weren't too good to even begin with).  One positive thing to point out that MCR are most definitely hip and dress well, they'd probably win a best dressed list if they showed up to a Norwegian heavy metal awards show, that or they would get a blanket party.  MCR are most likely going to burn out all their money like a lot of their fellow bands that have caught the glimpse of fame, not from drugs, but by purchasing the whole of makeup from some evil twin of Clinique.  A lot of whining and screaming ensues on this album, which is supposed to elicit some sympathy on the part of the listener, which is understandable because they are probably trying to score with some girls of the caring hot topic vulture variety.  That kind of whining I could respect, because it results in a markedly less outcome, being with the ladies.  But MCR's music isn't even directed towards the ladies and even actually sounds sincere and not an act at times.  This makes me wonder why they demand this sympathy because nothing in their music consist of any narrative of a broken childhood, the album's just filled with some allusions to some obscure issue from a Dark Horse comic book and some shoutouts to faux vampires.  So there being nothing to really sympathize with them for, I looked in the liner notes, and realized it was their hair, those are some pretty bad haicuts.  Their haircuts look somewhat comparable to what kind of cut Lorena Bobbitt would deliver to her husband if she were aiming at his hair instead of his package.  It would probably be a more terrible end as a bad haircut could result in the loss of a job at a business while a nationwide story about the loss of one's manhood receives national sympathy. Anyway, their music is some kind of conglomeration of opera and emo.  By opera I don't mean actual opera, but the Green Day - American Idiot styled opera.  And by emo I don't mean like Rites of Spring or The Smiths but like Green Day - Good Riddance styled emo.  I had the misfortune of working at the theater and hearing the song Helena over and over again and it made me wonder if the song or the Paris Hilton vehicle House Of Wax it was playing on was, I decided to go for a tie then, now I'm thinking the song is worse.  I criticized MCR's lyrics about vampires in a previous album but I'm going to have to do it again.  I do particularly recall any specific instances of talk about vampires, but they seem to throw the word around like insurgents throw grenades, heavily.  I hope MCR are aware that vampires do not exist anymore.  I think they died out in the ice age slightly before the mammoth, that was a long time ago.  MCR need to move on, get past this infatuation with vampires and committing intimate acts with them.  This album definitely is worthy of the big 1.

His stories are thrillers and suspenseful. <br />However, Camel Club appears to have been written by a political hack, in particular a left wing hack.  The book is riddled with propaganda and leftist cliches that I almost threw the book in the trash.   <br />\\"Oliver Stone\\" is the main character in the book, and it appears that Oliver Stone may have helped write the book. <br />
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I still remember how original and amazing the singls \\"BLIND\\" was when I first heard it many years ago. This new album... and a others before it... ugh. This is what I would expect \\"In Flames\\" (search them on Amanzon if you aren't in the know) would probably sound like if they ever \\"sold out\\" (and i doubt they will, but don't quote me on that).  I don't see much oroginal here. Different direction for Korn... okay. I can see that. Original sound NO WAY----NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. Why can't bands stick to their guns? In the long run---the endurance makes fame--AND MONEY. Perhaps the short path brings big money quickly, but dying young isn't something many people dream of.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Fall Out Boy but thinks that they could be so much better with a little actual talent. <br /> <br />Yes, I'll admit that they sound similar to Fall Out Boy. The first time I ran through the CD, the first 10 seconds of each song were irritating and all the same. Later when I picked up the CD again and actually attempted to listen to it, I was in complete rapture.. it is that good. <br /> <br />They have a style of music that is unlike any other, one song may have a techno dance beat, the next may have pizzicato on a cello. The diversity in their sound is astounding, but also sounds so good. Their lyrics bring to mind an old decaying victorian parlor with a disco ball and moshing. <br /> <br />You might be thinking now: \\"oh, well this sounds like a fangirl's comment, they must not be thinking straight\\" but you need, I stress, NEED to AT LEAST LISTEN to one song (\\"I write sins not tragedies...\\"), you will NOT regret it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|this is a great debut from a woman with a really astounding voice didos debut is brilliant one of the main things about this album is it is quite long you may skip tracks the first time but this is one of the few albums i have brought that i will listen to every song soft mellow nothing you can mosh too so i suggest metal heads steer clear unless you have an open mind i for one love bands such as system even though im not into metal i reckon this is for anyone only excluding people with any prejudice against music of this genre theres nothing completely genre defining on this record just outstanding songs
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Eric Clapton being a long time friend of George's found it necessary to pay a tribute to his friend. <br />Clapton invited Harrisons' close friends and musicians who had recorded with him over the years. <br />Clapton and the band took the time to work the songs out and make it sound right. <br />Tom Petty does a great version of I Need You from the movie Help. He also does almost a note for note version of Taxman from Revolver with Mike Campbell adding a very nice solo. <br />Billy Preston shares the vocals on Isnt it a Pity, and Preston also does a very strong version of My Sweet Lord as well. <br />Tom Petty also pays tribute to his Traveling Wilbury bandmate with Handle Me With Care. <br />McCartney also does a nice ukelele version of Something which turns into the electric version we have all come to know and love. <br />Paul Also does a version of All Things Must Pass that is extraordinary. Clapton and McCartney also do a killer version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps as they sing harmony on the chorus. <br />Ringo Starr steps in to do Photograph which was a song he and George wrote together. <br />Jeff Lynne does a great version of The Inner Light with Ravi Shankar's daughter adding sitar. <br />This is an outstanding tribute to George Harrison and in many ways gives closure to his death. <br />The only problem with the concert is that George is not alive to sing the songs himself. <br />This is a must for any Beatles fan and a must for any Harrison fan
B000002C2E|5.0|What can i say about this album? <br /> <br /> From the dark and brooding 'Not dark yet' to the more upbeat 'Cold irons bound', this album has everything you could possibly want (or expect from a Dylan classic). <br /> <br /> At a time when most people thought that Dylan had taken to writing nursery rhymes or reinventing folk songs from his childhood, along comes a truly unique collection of songs that re-establish him as the greatest songwriter of all time. <br /> <br />  This album is a great place to start to appreciate the true genius of a man with a career spanning in excess of 40 years! How many of todays singers or bands will be as discussed even 10 years from today? <br /> <br />  The opening title 'Lovesick' has you tapping along to it's rhythym, whilst the imagery takes your imagination to it's furthest reaches. 'I'm sick of love, I'm lovesick!'   Dylan the wordsmith, plays with the language and moulds it in his unique way, in order to get his point across. <br /> <br />   I would recomend this album to any and everyone, Dylan enthusiast or not, this should take pride of place in your collection. <br /> <br />  Even Dylans voice, worn by years of relentless touring suits the album. When he sings 'I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal', you feel his pain and truly beleive in what sings. Here is man fast approaching the twilight years of his life, and via this collection of songs he allows us to empathise with the fears and tribulations that confront him.  <br /> <br /> Don't take my word for it, get the album, sit back and be taken on a magical journey!!!
0060174900|5.0|I love this book it is one of my favorites. I relate to the college experience and being unable to focus on physics :-) The setting is intriguing in New York and the time period is as well, classic. Not your best pick-me up book, it's a little down, but Sylvia makes her character very relatable, and overall it's a great book.
B00006I53S|5.0|If you own the XT or 20D, this is the perfect walk around lens!  It doesn't get particularly wide and it doesn't zoom very large, but with the 1.6x crop factor, the zoom is better than expected.  Imaging is clear and precise and the image stabilization feature is fantastic.  The macro function isn't overly impressive, but it's solid.  Other lenses will focus much closer, but this isn't meant to be a specialty lens.  It's a jack of all trades lens that excels at everything it was designed for. You simply can't go wrong with this lens.
B00004RFFS|5.0|First off I just want to point out to the person who was freaking out in a review about the movie not being scary and it's \\"pansy\\" yadda yadda yadda.  This was NOT meant to be a horror film.  Anyone familiar with Anne's work would understand that she writes drama and the characters in her stories are indeed mythical: witches, vampires, ghosts etc.  If your goal is to watch a slasher movie go see The Mangler.   <br /> <br />The truth is there ARE NO set rules as to wether or not vampires have a conscience.  Any outrage because of the portrayal of a vampire with one is well. . .odd.  Vampires don't exist.  So if you actually KNOW any vampires who are mindless cold-blooded killers and are bound to stand stubbornly by your plea at how OFF the mark this movie is, please introduce us!   <br /> <br />I actually do know real life vampires who are nothing more than hardcore goth and blood drinking mortals.  Yet they too seem to have a conscience.  Sound the alarm! Vampires with a conscience! Haha! <br /> <br />There is no doubt this movie is intended to be full of romanticism just as are Anne's literary works.  It is unapologetically romantic and full of yes \\"mush\\" and emotion and *cough**cough* a battle with morality and conscience.  This is the REASON I enjoy her work.  If I wanted brain-dead horror I'd read something else, I'd watch something else-like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  <br /> <br />I was afraid to watch this movie when I first heard it was coming out because, like so many other fans, I had read Anne's work before she hit the mainstream and I had fallen in love with it and all it represented.  I wondered how Hollywood could bring her prose to life.  I was upset that Tom Cruise was Lestat yes, I was upset Brad Pitt was Louis yes, and I was even upset that Antonio Banderas was Armand (and I do LOVE Antonio!).  <br /> <br />But after watching the movie the first time around I was overjoyed at how the characters were portrayed and I was totally blown away by Tom's attempts to capture the essence of Lestat.  More than that I was really impressed with Kristen Dunst as Claudia.  Even though I still had my power struggle with Antonio as Armand, if I forgot everything else about Armand-his history in the Chronicles-then indeed Antonio's portrayal captured Armand's persona of seduction and selfish destruction-and yes loneliness-the driving force of it all.   <br /> <br />So, if you aren't afraid of romanticism and moral battles, of drama within an underworld of vampires, and you can allow yourself to get lost in the thoughts of starry nights, candle light, sexuality, and pain-then my friend this is the movie for you.  You can always watch horror slasher films another night, they come by the truckload.  Movies like this are few and far between.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Entertainment is a commodity. People buy it in bulk to fill their idle hours. This is a fair specimen of bulk entertainment.<br /><br />It has all the right pieces. There's the pair of happy go lucky ex-military buddies, out to make a few bucks, have a few laughs, and save the world. There's the pair of WHO doctors, out to track down a mysterious disease and to save the world. (The requisite babe is one of the doctors.) There's the evil business man, out to make a few bucks even if it destroys the entire Atlantic ocean.<br /><br />Did I mention credibility? No? There's a reason for that. If you can believe a gunboat from the American civil war in the middle of the Sahara, you'll get along with this movie just fine. You might even believe that the gun still works. If you don't look too closely, it's just a good guns'n'chases eco-fable where everyone keeps their clothes on. You could do worse. In fact, if you're considering this movie, you probably have done worse.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B0001GMIOE|5.0|I bought the battery grip and a spare battery and highly recommend both.  I have no doubt that an aftermarket battery is just as good, but at this price, why bother?  I went to Best Buy and they wanted $10 more for an Energizer battery.  Apparently the battery is also used in many Canon camcorders so they are in ready supply.  That's good news for us because it means cheaper batteries.  This spare battery is essential if you plan to shoot while vacationing (did you remember to take your battery charger??!) or while mountain climbing or taking spectacular shots of the Grand Canyon.

B000BTC5LW|1.0|Hey, David! What is such a big deal to delay this DVD. Do you know how many people around the world waiting for it. The result of this long delay is mass production of bad quality bootlegs from Russia and other countries made from VHS tapes. <br /> Even after the date of official release was announced it's still has been delayed three times and afterwords the real release date is unknown. If anybody knows what's goind on, please,wtite about it. <br /> By the way, the same story is with ''DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER'' DVD.

0553801503|2.0|It is a quiddity of the epic fantasy series.  Even the best fantasy series seem to putter off just after the halfway point of the series.  It happened to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, it happened to Raymond Feist's Riftwar Saga (to a lesser degree), and it's happening now to our beloved Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. <br /> <br />The first 3 books in the series made me want to crawl into a empty cave and finish them, savor them.  The plot was gripping, characters were alternately fascinating and revolting, and you cared about what happened to them.  Everything that happened was actually important. <br /> <br />Not so here.  In fact, of the 700-some pages of book 4, only about two or three hundred held anything close to my rapt attention.  The rest were nearly worthless to the storyline and did little to enhance the reader's enjoyment.  I found myself skimming Brienne's chapters because they all read kind of the same way and nothing ever seemed to happen.  Unfortunately, she was not the only character to suffer from listless writing. <br /> <br />By now you know the fiasco with the publisher wanting to split the book into 2 and hence the omission of several key characters' chapters.  I pray the author has the sense to avoid falling prey to the \\"Jordan Syndrome\\" of slower plotlines, more words and bitter readers buying just to find out what happens next, but hating themselves for falling for it.
0060005696|5.0|I enjoyed this book as a twenty-something who is in the frame of mind of having a massive plethora of big life decisions at my doorstep. I was pleased that Barry Schwartz had plenty of interesting research and anecdotes to back up his theories, balancing science with real world and easy-to-understand examples. If you are finding yourself overwhelmed, this might be what you need to realize you aren't alone, and that there are actions you can take to overcome feelings of paralyzation.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Born in '65, i was too young to really SEE the Beatles happen, but always exposed to their music.  After seeing this incredible documentary i have new appreciation for both their music as a group and later as individual artists, and for each of the Beatles as the people they were, became, and are today.  This collection is a real treasure.  I watched all 6 dvds with 3 children aged 14-19 and their father who WAS there to see it all happen and is a musician himself.  Everyone fully engaged; this story is exceedingly amazing, humane, and both historical and timeless.  Depth of character (both strengths and flaws), creative vision and courage, and distinctive personalities of every Beatle is revealed and emphasized, particularly when you get to see how their interviewed recounting is humorously contradictory.  Beautiful footage of John and George, god bless them both.  Thank you boys for giving us so much joy and feeding our souls with your creative gifts.  The grace and humor with which you handled the landslide of fame and fortune is a tribute in itself.
B00005RY7X|1.0|It pukes up Andrew WK of course. <br /> <br />There have been lots of novelty acts in the history of rock.. let's hope this one doesn't last too long. <br /> <br />This music is flacid, uncreative and unimaginative.. it's no wonder it appeals to the current generation of rock listener's who have been duped by the marketing genius behind Andrew WK. <br /> <br />Anyway if it like his stuff then you should really do yourself a favor and throw it away and listen to KISS as they truly knew how to Party All Night Long and were doing it way before this jerk was even twinkle in someone's eye. Of course they are old now and the kiddies can't relate to anyone that is so \\"5 minutes ago\\" let alone ten or twenty years ago... what with the attention defecit disorders and ritalin that they are on.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|This movie was very slow going.  If you are looking for a good scare......keep looking.  I gave it two stars because Jennifer Connelly is a wonderful actress.
B000BWI9U0|4.0|If you are a fan of the strokes, then you will like this album. If your not, give it a try it just may grow on you. Other reviewers will give you a breakdown of each track, but I think albums have an \\"overall\\" feel to them. The overall feel of this album is one of maturity, at least for the band. Each member has grown musically. Casablancas writes lyrics about more than just getting drunk at parties and hooking up with some random girl. Valensi uses chorus on his guitar smartly in this album, not too much, but just enough to give it a slight metal sound. Very artistic. Some say this album is a true display of Fraiture's bass-playing talent and I agree. Although the sound is different is some ways, they still have that signature strokes sound. Also, one other thing that many people have overlooked is that this is the strokes longest album to date. Not quite 55 minutes, but very full length. \\"Is this It\\" and \\"Room on fire\\" were so short I fit them both on one disc along with a couple of b-sides. In my opinion, the last 2 albums were more EP length than full length but obviously no one complained due to the quality packed in. If you want a bigger, badder, (and longer) strokes, pick this up right now. Oh, and make sure you get the deluxe packaging. It has picture \\"cards\\" of the band members (so you can put your favorite in the front display) in the front sleeve and lyrics and other artwork in the back sleeve.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|If you live Friends you will love those DVD as I do, especially with the bonus takes which without them, some of the things they do that shows on tv doesnt make sense. But the people here are selling it too expensive, from $255 to $389, and it's not even new from stock. I bought mine at a store i'm not gonna say at $167, and it's new, never opened or anything, which is almost like half of the price from these sellers, so i suggest you to check those store which are more worth it, but if u have the money and wanna buy it here, do it, you will still enjoy the dvds.

B0007Y08QA|4.0|\\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't even exist,\\" someone says to Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale), in Brad Anderson's \\"The Machinist.\\" That quote is not an exaggeration: Trevor is six feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. He claims that he hasn't slept in a year, which is especially dangerous since he works in a factory operating heavy machinery, where appendages can abruptly find themselves devoid of a body if the equipment is not used correctly. <br /> <br />Something is obviously wrong with Trevor. He goes to the same airport restaurant every night for coffee and pie and a little flirting session with a cute waitress (Aitana Snchez-Gijn). He slums around his dingy apartment and the gray-tainted industrial streets of the city with dark circles under his eyes. Everyone, from his co-workers to a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who happens to be the only one he trusts, ask him if he's okay. \\"It's nothing I can't handle,\\" Trevor says, a quote that lingers in infamy throughout the film. <br /> <br />Trevor's physical condition, slowly but surely, begins to wage a relentless war on his psyche, particularly when he meets a mysterious co-worker named Ivan, a man with two of his toes implanted on his fingerless hand and whom nobody else sees. This sets off a chain of events that lead Trevor to believe that there is a conspiracy against him, and that everyone is in on the plot. Either this is true and Trevor is a victim of a very cruel game or he is on the verge of losing his mind. Or maybe, just maybe, he already has. <br /> <br />\\"The Machinist\\" is a curious project, in that it's secrets are interconnected and seem to overlap one another. And the secrets themselves are revealed at moments where director Brad Anderson seems to be shying away from the material. This is just my guess, but \\"The Machinist\\" is probably an attempt to top \\"One Hour Photo,\\" a superior film in which a man's obsession with a family nearly drives him over the edge. When you watch Brad Anderson's atmospheric creeper, you realize that Trevor gives leeway to the old saying that says you are your worst enemy. <br /> <br />Funny how Christian Bale dropped sixty pounds to play the role of Trevor and still managed to go through \\"Batman Begins\\" without pulling up his Batbelt. When you watch Trevor look into the mirror, all you see is a skeleton with skin, but that skeleton sure knows what he's doing. Bale apparently had to go through a lot to play this role, almost as much physical torture as Trevor endures. But watch how Bale plays his role with a no-nonsense attitude, and how he immerses his character in a nightmare that he can not wake up from.  <br /> <br />The supporting roles are fine, Leigh as the sympathizing hooker, Snchez-Gijn as the supportive waitress. Both women know that something is seriously wrong with Trevor, that something is plauging his mind. They want to help, but what they don't realize is that Trevor just wants their company. Still, in the end, when numerous surprises are unwrapped, the realities of the two women are redefined, and the women are revealed to have fresh meaning to Trevor's tormented mind. <br /> <br />Exactly what is bugging Trevor seems somewhat contrived, albeit thoroughly convincing. It takes a lot of thought to imagine the pain that Trevor experiences day-in and day-out. You can conjure at least some amount of sympathy for this poor creature who lies awake at night, counting sheep, and reaching number 1,000,000 just before the sun rises and curses him with another day of life. <br /> <br />Rated R; 101 minutes; Directed by Brad Anderson <br />
0307276902|1.0|Then I felt like a player in a poker game with a mirror behind my back. The book is in no way a memoir, the lies become so obvious after a while that it's insulting to the reader. His style is intriguing at first, then it becomes tiresome and tedious. The glowing reviews astound me. The positive side is that I see now that anyone can write a book. Now if I could only get on Oprah's book list. And maybe we need a treatment program for Oprah addicts. Cheap pulp fiction at it's best.
B000002KDM|3.0|This album is a nice and soft Taylor Album.  It has a few really nice songs, like You've got a friend, You can close you're eyes, long ago and faraway and riding on the railroad.  Really though, it lacks a lot of charm that Sweet baby James had.  The  album is a long album with a long gap between hits; and a lot of those songs in between are songs you'd like to skip.  If you're already a Taylor fan, there is no reason why you should not own this already because Taylor fans would kill for this stuff.  But if you're someone who simply qualifies his music or is starting to get into it, this album is just a touch dull.  Personally though it is not one of my favorite Taylor albums as a Taylormaniac myself. I would get the best of collection to  get the essentials from this because the albums goes between great and awful.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the CD, well worth the money.  Blends some of his classic stuff with his newer stuff.  I highly reccomend the following songs: Walk the Line, Get Rhythm, Rusty Cage, I've Been Everywhere, When the Man Comes around, and Hurt.<br /><br />All in all a good cd.
0312330537|5.0|It's interesting that Roberts is at pains to insist that this is a work of fiction, given that it is largely based on his own life. Many not from Australia, or indeed Melbourne, will be unaware that most of what's written is true. Roberts was known as the \\"Building Society Bandit\\" after a string of armed robberies, including a repeat visit to one institution where apparently he politely reminded the cashier of his previous attendance and was promptly handed all their money. Furthermore, Roberts' escape from Pentridge jail, Melbourne's most notorious prison, was so rare and his eluding the police rarer still, that his story soon became one to rival that of another Australian criminal icon: Ned Kelly. <br /> <br />This is a marvellous book. Roberts writing style is rich and his ability to retell seemingly horrendous events without over-sentamentility is astounding. Obviously, his recapture (it'll most likely appear in the sequel) afforded him sufficient time to comprehend the diverse pattern his life has followed. <br /> <br />Read this with the knowledge that this is a life that has been lived, and you'll be amazed even more.

Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all who claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think everything you're supposed to think?  Buy what you're told you should want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned.
B00005JKES|1.0|This review has little to do with the original series itself, but rather with the extremely poor quality of the DVD set I received.  Clearly this has been edited, and the quality of the copy is horrible.  At first my DVD player wouldn't read it at all, then when it finally did, there were major skips in the copy at critical points.  I wouldn't recommend this item as a purchase for anyone.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|The true horror in this movie is that the first child goes missing and NO ONE is aware or cares enough to question the child's absence. How many children does this happen to on a daily basis in this country?<br /><br />And how many parents would actually have the moral stamina to take the action that this mother took to save her still-living child? It's very easy to pay lip service to what you would do for your child, but much harder to put into action when required.<br /><br />As usual with the Japanese horror genre, it raises more questions than it answers, and answers no question easily.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Contrary to what many people are writing about the new Strokes album, it is indeed a different and very welcome addition to the catalog of the best band of the 2000's so far. The album as a whole has a different feel to the previous two albums, which is a very good thing in my opinion. Is This It and Room on Fire are two of my favorite albums but a new sound is more than welcome. People seemed to complain about Room on Fire sounding too much like Is This It (which I didn't agree with) but now on their new album they explored new territories and sounds and people seem to still gripe about it and say it doesn't sound enough like the first two albums. The point of being in a band is to always look for ways to expand your sound and mature as artists. First Impressions of Earth in my opinion shows how they did just that. \\"You Only Live Once\\" is now my favorite Strokes song. It is a perfectly crafted work of pop art and is worth the price of the CD alone. Other songs like \\"Ask Me Anything\\" and \\"Fear of Sleep\\" are a new and radical departure from their previous sounds so \\"fans\\" wanting a rehash of the first two albums may be disappointed, but the rest of us true Strokes fans can truly appreciate the album as a step forward in the career of The Strokes. I highly recommend this album to anyone who truly appreciates great music and wants to run as far as possible from the countless so called \\"musicians\\" out there. Pick this album up today! You won't be sorry.
B000001F9E|5.0|Thin Lizzy's Jailbreak\\" is a great story-based hard rock album from the 70's which is very original. As opposed to mindless lyrics in the vein of Van Halen and AC/DC, Thin Lizzy's songs were mostly tales that were mostly interesting to listen to (though that's probably not the real reason you'll listen to one of their songs). Some of the songs don't instantly strike you as good, but with several listens one will begin to like them. Singer/songwriter Phil Lynott is a great choice for the band's style, and the musicianship is tight and pretty complex (they inspired many with their dual-guitar setup). It also goes through a good amount of moods and pacing - not every song is high energy like Van Halen is, for example. \\"Cowboy Song\\" is a good example as it starts off slow and eventually gets faster paced. Every track here is either good or excellent (and the hits \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" definitely add to its appeal). I'll admit that it IS a guilty pleasure to an extent, but definitely not so much that most people wouldn't like it. Fans of the genre and music historians/collectors will most likely love it. If it weren't for its historical influence, though, I probably would've given it a \\"4.5\\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0684824906|5.0|With \\"Team of Rivals\\", Doris Kearns Goodwin gives us an amazingly fresh and original view of our greatest president. As many reviewers have noted, writing anything new about Abraham Lincoln or the Civil War era is a daunting task - yet here Ms. Goodwin succeeds admirably.      The greatest value of \\"Team of Rivals\\" is the light it sheds on Lincoln's character and how it sustained not only him, but those around him as well.One is forced to conclude that Lincoln truly was our greatest asset during the Civil War. Without his leadership, it is easy to see how the Confederacy might have prevailed. With his leadership, we see how the Union always retained the upper hand in the struggle despite repeated setbacks on the battlefield.      As always, Doris Kearns Goodwin is a great story teller. Her enthusiasm for her subject is contagious. Most of all, she causes us to appreciate the nature of all forms of great leadership - something most essential in our republic.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby's \\"Play\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. It's definitely my favorite electronica album, and there were so many hits (\\"Southside\\", \\"Run On\\", \\"Porcelain\\", etc...) off this album that it's easy to see why. Even the tracks which WEREN'T hits are extremely well done and very interesting. The lyrics especially are surprisingly good for this kind of album. Moby's voice isn't bad - I happen to like it a lot even if it's not necessarily for everybody. Every track here is fun and interesting which is ultra-rare (especially given the number of tracks). There's also a wide-range of emotions, pacing, and genres on display here - several of the tracks sound like they could be from a different artist or album. My personal favorites are \\"Run On\\", \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\\" and \\"The Sky Is Broken\\" (this is a strange song for the album, but I like it). I think this is an essential album for ANY electronica fan and I would argue that non-fans of the genre would have a hard time disliking it. Moby struck gold with \\"Play\\"! Absolutely recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />the entire album!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've been a Madonna fan for about 22 years now and own every studio album she's ever done.  She just keeps getting better and better.  This trip back to her dance roots definitely wasn't wasted.  I think I might take this cd to a club I frequent and get the dj to play a couple tracks.
B00005B0PU|5.0|The 60's were indeed a great decade - SO many classics came out it's pretty staggering. The Zombies' \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" is but one of many timeless albums released in that decade, and it doesn't disappoint (though it's barely a classic). It's extremely accessible for most people and definitely fun and interesting to listen to (it also features the timeless hit \\"Time Of The Season\\"!). The singer is usually dead-on as a psychedelic pop singer - he has pretty good charm, although in some songs he's a little iffy (like on \\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\\"). The harmonies on this album are notably great. The lyrics are unfortunately not all that great. Musically the album is also fantastic. This is primarily a psychedelic album, but it DOES cover a little R&B and pop rock. The audio quality is also very very good considering it was recorded in 1968. I'm pretty sure everybody can enjoy this album along with other classics like, say, The Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Greatest Hits\\". I think I would've given this a \\"4.5\\", but its historical influence, the classic \\"Time Of The Season\\" and all the bonus tracks pushes it to a \\"5\\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:   the entire album (except for probably \\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914\\")
1582403589|5.0|I can't express in words just how great this graphic novel is...but I will try anyway.  <br /> <br />From the intriguing opening page to the suspensful conclusion of this wonderful story, I was simply in awe.  I have already purchased and read book 2 and 3 which keeps snowballing this supurb story into comic book history.  I recommend this book and all the others in this series very highly.   <br /> <br />If you have read the descriptions of this book already you probably know that this isn't just some \\"horror\\" comic, but it is a character driven sociological dream come true.  Please give this a chance, I swear you won't regret it.

0385335482|5.0|I simply cannot stop raving about this book, this author, and this series! <br /> <br />Confessions of a Shopaholic is the story of Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial writer for a prominent London financial journal.  However, Becky's expertise with money stops when she leaves her desk...she cannot stop shopping. <br /> <br />As the novel progresses, Becky attempts to stop spending money time and time again.  Each try, however, only seems to throw her more into debt.  Toss in a gorgeous (and wealthy!) love interest, and you will fly through this book. <br /> <br />Sophie Kinsella's first novel in the Shopaholic series is absolutely hilarious!  While some may find Becky un-relatable, whiny, or boring (not my terms...) if you seriously give this book a try, you won't be disappointed.  My one recommendation: make sure you have a copy of Shopaholic Takes Manhattan close by.  You won't want the story to end after this first novel! <br />
B000268QB2|4.0|Keane's \\"Hopes And Fears\\" is a surprisingly good debut despite some of its problems. The first half of this album is golden - 5 great 00's era pop rock songs (with more pop than rock). Tom Chaplin is also very good as he has impressive range and I think most people will like him. Lyrically the songs aren't bad - they're more catchy and memorable than interesting. It's relatively easy to sing along, but chances are you won't. There are no \\"bad\\" songs here. It comes close to being classic, but I just don't think it's good enough artistically and musically to warrant it. It's definitely not bad, though - you're still going to really like it. I don't think everyone will like it, but pop fans will love it (it's a sort of guilty pleasure for most people but pop fans will adore it). One of the best pop albums of 2005. If you like this album chances are you'll love Melody Club's \\"Face The Music\\" and \\"Music Machine\\". Highly recommended!  <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />the entire album!
0743454537|5.0|I wanted to read this book because of the interesting subject matter it presented.  Having just finished it, I'm glad I read it.  I was prepared for the twist at the end, having read some reviews of the book prior to starting reading it, although I didn't know what exactly the twist would be, just that there was one.  I can understand why readers are frustrated with this ending, but I think it reflects the uncertainty and unpredictability of life--just when you think everything is going to be wrapped up in a neat little package, you are blindsided and things go horribly wrong.  I think we all know what Anna's decision was anyway.  I actually liked this ending.  If there was no epilogue, I would have disappointed--that was the true ending of the story for me. This is an excellent book that I think would be a great book for a book club discussion because the topic is so thought provoking.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas' \\"Illmatic\\" is one of the many classic albums of its day, but one thing that separates it from most of the other ones is that it isn't dated at all. You'll still have as much listening to this as you did in the mid-90's. With \\"Illmatic\\" Nas proves to us that even with great beats he can spit funny, moving and deep lyrics that are pretty quotable at times (my personal favorite is \\"I never sleep 'cuz sleep is the cousin o' death\\"). You can tell why this was such a historically influential album. Nas also has great charisma - I don't see how anyone wouldn't like his voice or delivery. As stated before, the production here is great with obvious standouts such as \\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\" and \\"Halftime\\". Though not every song is a classic like these two, they're ALL good if not great. Rap fans (and possibly non-genre fans) should love this album. Highly recommended! If you liked this I would also highly recommend Digable Planets' \\"Reachin' (A New Refutation Of Time And Space)\\", Jeru The Damaja's \\"The Sun Rises In The East\\", Ice Cube's \\"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\\" and Run-D.M.C.'s \\"Run-D.M.C.\\".    Highlights include:  the entire album!

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Ok well I'm sure you are all wondering if The Strokes new album titled,First Impressions Of Earth,is worth your money. When the hype first started for this album,their were claims that this is very out there,and a way different strokes sound. Well not to burst your bubble,but if you're going in their looking for something to sound like Radiohead's Kid A,don't. It's rather a step in a different direction,that shows signs that next time will be a full jump. It is a different sounding strokes,but not as much as the hype. They definitely evolved their sound a good amount though. For instance,in \\"Electricityscape\\",they almost sound like a U2 cover band. Or on \\"Ask Me Anything\\" it's just a mellotron played by guitarist Nic Valensi,with singer Julian Casablancas singing over it. Or even songs like \\"Heart In A Cage\\",which is one of the more 'Strokes' sounding songs on the album,sounds evolved,with the guitars shredding away from Albert Hammond Jr.,and Valensi. One of the bigger differences on First Impressions is the drumming by Fab Moretti. On previous albums,he played the role as a Ringo Starr. Now he is a full throttle drum machine. Classic opener \\"You Only Live Once\\" shows off his skills,along with lead single \\"Juicebox\\". But with all good things,their is always something bad. And with First Impressions there are bad things. First off,Nikolai Fraiture's bass has just vanished,which is a disappointment considering that on previous albums it was key. Other than a few tracks such as \\"On The Other Side\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" the bass is really silent,which brings me to my next point. The production by David Kahne isn't the best. He does give the album a more clearer sound,but the all together package of production is so-so. Another fault,is the album feels out of place. It just seems they took songs and drew out of a hat for where each track goes. Other than opener \\"You Only Live Once\\",and closer \\"Red Light\\",the rest of the order could of been better. For example,on the last fivesongs(10-14) it's like watching Lord Of The Rings:Return Of The King. Out of those five tracks,three of them could of been closers. \\"15 Minutes\\",\\"Evening Sun\\",and \\"Red Light\\" are all contenders for closer,which \\"Red Light\\" wins.I like \\"Red Light\\" the most out of those three songs,but the other two fit the closer role better. For Julian Casablancas' lyrics,I actually like them. In the past he's always been an average lyricst,but on First Impressions,he is improved. Sure they're is the line \\"I've got nothing to say\\",which is a very weak lyric. I mean it's just lazy. But there are more good moments than worse. \\"Razorblade\\" features the line \\"My feelings are more important than yours.\\" That is one of the best lines I've heard in a while. Overall,First Impressions has pros and cons,but the pros outshine the cons by miles. The songs are just too good on this album. On \\"Red Light\\" Casablancas' states \\"The sky is not the limit,and you're never going to guess what is\\",and with The Strokes,I really wonder.
6305126062|5.0|For any one who is interested in the animal/human spirit connection, this is a film you mustn't miss. Robert Redford's direction of 'The Horse Whisperer' is a triumph. A deeply emotionally touching film, in which Redford also stars,it offers stunning scenery and cinematography as well as many beautiful layers of metaphor, symbology and juxtaposition. It's a film which explores themes of redemption and healing. Healing of both the human and animal spirit as well as the healing of broken relationships and families.   Grace's broken body and spirit (The result of a devastating riding accident, resulting in her best friends death) as well as her troubled relationship with Mother 'Annie',are beautifully juxtaposed with that of her badly injured and traumatised, beloved horse Pilgrim. The failing marriage of her parents,contributing further to the disconnection of the family unit, also adds another interesting layer to the film and plot.  Enter 'Tom Booker' reluctantly persuaded out of semi-retirement by the persistant Annie as the especially skilled and gifted horse trainer/healer (or 'Horse Whisperer' as legend has it), and who also becomes the catalyst in the bridging of the gaps between each member of this family in crisis.  Their time spent away from New York in the beautiful natural 'Montanna' setting with Booker(and family),along with Pilgrim's difficult and gradual journey back through Bookers 'healing ways', gives Grace the faith, confidence and inspiration she herself needs to regain her strength of spirit and will to overcome her physical obstacle. It also helps in offering a way for Mother and daughter to reconnect. Through Grace's traumatic accident and away from her familiar enviroment Annie's character is forced to re-think her life as the previously workaholic and somewhat controlling absent parent. The attraction and connection between Tom Booker and Annie obviously adds the obligatory Romantic interest, but more importantly it provides the final turningpoint for Annie's character, when she is forced to make a choice between her own quest for personal happiness and what is ultimately best for her daughter.  Kristen Scott Thomas (Annie) and a very young Scarlett Johansson (Grace) are superb in their roles. Sam Neill plays his small supporting role as the husband and Father, nicely and an although aging 'Robert Redford' is still convincing and ruggedly charimastic as Booker. The real star of this film however is Redford's direction and camera team. The film is so visually powerful; full of both subtle nuances and dramatic contrasts of light,darkness,sound and setting. Be warned there are some confronting scenes. As an animal lover I admit I found the graphically dramatic depiction of the horsing accident and Pilgrim's terror and suffering, quite unsettling and difficult to watch. The breathtaking Montanna scenery is a welcoming escape and contrast from the dark, synthetic and repressive New York City scenes. When Grace and Annie set off on their rambling long journey across mid-north America with horse in tow, the mood becomes one full of hope and adventure. Gradually too the characters regain hope and strength through this adventure and long journey of the human soul. In a sense they are reborn; revived by nature and the deep bond which exists between animal and human. That is ultimately what moved me the most about this story.  The critics as I remember didn't give this film its due when it came out. Many fobbed it off as some sort of sentimental, contrived 'Robert Redford Vehicle'. Far from it. It is an exceptionally well acted, well crafted, deeply moving and inspiring story and movie experience.
B000001ELD|2.0|Buy this one for the front cover art only. If you want to listen to good Gene Simmons songs listen to almost any regular Kiss album. These must be a collection of songs that were voted down by the band on previous albums.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was the last great album of my collection. I collect a lot of great music. I even own a famous album, Led Zeppelin IV. But I like this one better than that one. I also own an LP of this album too. I own this album on CD, LP, & a songbook. Anyway, my favorite songs are Holiday, & Whatsername. Who cares if Boulevard <br />of Broken Dreams is overplayed, it's a really great song. Best album of 2004.
B000BGH22W|4.0|It is always difficult to review a film soudntrack, especially when all the other titles in the film series so far have been composed and conducted by the finest in the business, John Williams. Here, Williams steps down and is suceeded by Patrick Doyle. Now, Doyles high level of work is commendable, but I feel that he just can't deliver what the fans, and music lovers alike, have come to expect from Williams. Doyle uses \\"Hedwigs Theme\\" only minimally, and meddles with none other of the Williams 'Harry Potter themes'. Instead, as one would expect, he composes his own themes for various situations such as a romantic, melodic love theme for Harry, one or two beautiful waltz's, some wonderful fanfars and marches for different tri-wizard events and a new, immensely enjoyable and easily remembered theme for Voldemort. However, even with these musical treasures there is still a vast amount of room for improvement and expantion. Doyle injects emotion, tension, humour and downright scaryness into his music; worthy tracks are \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive\\", \\"The Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Harry In Winter\\" and the wonderfully dark and brooding track entitled \\"Voldemort\\". As I have said, this is not (in my opinion) the best of the Harry Potter film soundtracks but it is certainly a worthy entry. What follows is a brief description of each track: <br /> <br />1) THE STORY CONTINUES:  This track opens on a rythmic thudding by loud percussion, followed by a new motif (very dark in feeling), the track is finished with the use of \\"Hedwigs Theme\\". <br /> <br />2) FRANK DIES: Dark, brooding and scary music is played quietly, whilst the new theme for Voldemort is played over the top. Strings play loudly, and Voldemort's theme flourishes before an abrupt end. <br /> <br />3) THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP: Starts instantly with a cheery, Irish style jig which blends into a loud, rythmic chant underscored with dark music and choir.  <br /> <br />4) THE DARK MARK: Full orchestra plays loud, music; strings andbrass grow, before the first utterance of the new \\"Love Theme\\" is introduced. The track ends with a loud rendition of Voldemorts theme. <br /> <br />5) FOREIGN VISITORS ARRIVE: Hedwigs theme opens this track, followed by the love theme and two new motifs representing he schools of Beauxbatons and Durmstrung. <br /> <br />6) THE GOBLET OF FIRE: Voldemort's theme introduces this piece of music which quickly transforms into three fanfares as the wizards of different schools are chosen. As the Goblet belches a fourth name, Voldemorts theme is blasted out by the orchestra. The remaining fragments of the track use dark music to represent the current situation. <br /> <br />7) RITA SKEETER: This is a short track, that uses light hearted and quirky music to identify the character of Rita. <br /> <br />8) SIRIUS FIRE: Once more, dark and brooding music is used with hints of Voldemorts theme.  <br /> <br />9) HARRY SEES DRAGONS: Scary, high pitched music is used to demonstrate the effect of Dragon breath! <br /> <br />10) THE GOLDEN EGG: Classic Williams style action cues are used here, with a few terrifyingly string pieces; loud brass and percussion represent the flight of Harry and the Dragon. The piece finishes on a fanfare, followed by a great rendition of the Love theme. <br /> <br />11) NEVILLES WALTZ: The first of three \\"waltz style\\" consecutive tracks, two of which are used in the \\"Yule Ball\\" scenes. This waltz is, in one word, Magnificent. It is instantly memorable. <br /> <br />12) HARRY IN WINTER: This is the main theme of the new soundtrack. This is used in numerous tracks to illustrate Harry Potter, I have labelled it a \\"love theme\\" mainly because it is used to demonstrate the relationship between not only Harry and his parents, but also between him and Cho Chang. It is a beautifullly crafted piece of musc, and the album should, at the very least, be bought for this track alone. <br /> <br />13) HARRY'S WALTZ: This piece of music is fast and, for some reason, funny! After seeing the film, one can remember Harry's hectic footwork whilst at the Ball and this music illustrates the comedic value perfectly. <br /> <br />14) UNDERWATER SECRETS: Light, dizzy style music underscores the 'bathroom scene'. It utilises words from the Novel. Not an awful lot happens here though. <br /> <br />15) THE BLACK LAKE: Once again, rather like \\"THE GOLDEN EGG\\", this music is fast paced, loud and bombastic. It uses one or two fanfares but no new thematic material is present. <br /> <br />16) HOGWARTS MARCH: This is a great track. Doyle has composed a new, well, March for Hogwarts. It is short in length, but instantly memorable. It is played twice in the film, and it is a great listen. <br /> <br />17) THE MAZE: Dark, scary music is played from start to finish. It is loud, fast and at times, I found hard to listen to. <br /> <br />18) VOLDEMORT: In my opinion, one of the finest pieces of music ever composed for a film of any genre. Doyle outdoes himself, and has produced a 10 minutes composition that has to be heard to be believed. Like many tracks on the Album, it is dark and brooding, but there is a difference. Voldemorts theme is, as one expects, prevelant throughout. It slowly builds to a loud, bombastic brass \\"battle\\" style music, and only gets better with the albums finest, and also saddest, rendition of the new \\"love theme\\" as Harry and Voldemorts wands begin to entwine. <br /> <br />19) CEDRICS DEATH: A sad, short piece underscored with the \\"love theme\\". It illustrates beautifully the torture and emotion that Amos Diggory is going through after discovering that his son has been killed. <br /> <br />20) ANOTHER YEAR ENDS: This track is, like the love theme, beautiful in it's simplicity. Strings build to a triumphant ending as the schools of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang say farewell to Hogwarts. It is a wonderful ending to the film, and works equally as good as a piece of classical music. <br /> <br />21) HOGWARTS HYMM: Like the previous track, this music is wonderful. Somehow, Doyle has captured the spirit of the school in his composition and reveals it all in this final track. <br /> <br />22 - 24) VARIOUS SONGS: I have to admit, one of the reasons I disliked this score was for the last three tracks. They are, in my opinion, utter rubbish. Unlike Williams' \\"Double Trouble\\" which was magically brilliant, these three rock songs just don't deliver. They are loud, un-thematic and brings the listening value of the album down one star. <br /> <br />Despite my critiscm of the album and of Patrick Doyles work, I believe that change is for the better. Hopefully, should he return for \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" his work will feel more concrete and the sounds that we hear now will become part of the Harry Potter Music that we all know and adore. For anyone who likes the music from the series I highly recommend this album, but for those who wish to hear a sample of such music from \\"Pre-Doyle days\\" then perhaps \\"THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN\\" soundtrack would be more advantageous; it is, in my opinion, the best of the series soundtracks to date.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time. My favorite songs are Industrial Disease, & It Never Rains. 3 of the more popular songs <br />are terrific too, Telegraph Road, Private Investigations, & Love  <br />Over Gold. Every song on this just ROCKS! Go buy it now because Dire Straits ROCK!!!!!!!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|All I can say is this album is AWESOME. All around a great album, the musicianship is superb. The vocals are some of the best I've heard. Not a dull song on the album
0805076476|5.0|Yes, I saw the movie first.  I found out it was a novel long after a couple times of watching it. <br />If you thought the movie was good, you have to read the book!!  Its like watching the movie, only with more words.   <br />The book gives a better overview of what is going on between the characters.  Is it really a romance?  Is it a drama?  A tragedy?  A comedy?  There is more feeling in the book.   <br />I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B000060MMI|5.0|I had never heard of Flogging Molly or any of their music until one day someone gave me this CD. Now I was a huge Irish music fan or anything I was just typical, and the first song I heard by FM was \\"What's Left of the Flag\\" on this very CD. From that very moment on I fell in love with Flogging Molly. They have hard rock beats with a nice balance of lighter music. They have real catchy toons you will want to sing along with. (great in concert).  <br /> <br />After I got this CD I had to have every other FM Cd, and I got them all. Hee hee hee. FM RULES! This is their best CD as well. <br /> <br />FEW CHOICE SONGS: (In Case You Want To TEst Out Some Before Getting) <br />- 1. Drunken Lullabies  <br />- 2. What's Left of the Flag  <br />- 6. Rebels of the Sacred Heart  <br />- 4. If I Ever Leave this World Alive
B000001EG6|4.0|This was Elton John's second album, but his American debut (\\"Empty Sky\\" was released in 1975 in the United States.)  It has a much different sound and feel stylistically than \\"Empty Sky.\\"  While it has a few weak spots here and there, the high points are among the best in his entire career. <br /> <br />1. Your Song-5/5.  What can I say about this song that hasn't already been said?  Beautiful lyrics, great music and vocals.  His most well known song and one of the best of his hits. <br />2. I Need You To Turn To-5/5.  Elton used the harpsichord quite a bit on \\"Empty Sky\\" and he used it again on this song.  It fits the song perfectly.  One of the best songs on here. <br />3. Take Me To the Pilot-5/5.  A bit gospel-sounding with some rock and roll thrown in.  Great music and vocals with some of Taupin's best lyrics.   <br />4. No Shoe Strings On Louise-3/5.  This is one of the album's weak spots.  Very country souding with some very twangy guitar.  Sometimes Taupin wrote lyrics that he thought sounded good, even though they don't make sense.  This is one of those times. <br />5. First Episode At Hienton-4/5.  Great music and vocals with very strange lyrics.  Slow ballad featuring Elton and the piano.  His performance shines. <br />6. Sixty Years On-4/5.  Another ballad, which this album is full of.  Great lyrics and vocals.  Another Elton and piano only song. <br />7. Border Song-5/5.  Another very gospelly song.  Excellent lyrics and music with one of Elton's greatest vocal deliveries.  One of my favorite Elton songs ever. <br />8. The Greatest Discovery-4/5.  Another ballad.  The music is great, the vocals are okay, but the lyrics leave much to be desired.  I know this is supposed to be sentimental about the birth of a brother, but I just don't feel it. <br />9. The Cage-4/5.  An upbeat rocker, with lyrics that don't really make sense.  The music is great and the vocal delivery is good. <br />10. The King Must Die-5/5.  Definetly the best song on the album and oneof his best ever.  Very cinematic and epic.  Excellent lyrics, music and vocals.  I can't get enough of this one. <br /> <br />Bonus Tracks: <br /> <br />11. Bad Side of the Moon-4/5.  Pretty good music with goofy lyrics and even goofier vocals.  Not too bad, but definetly not suited for inclusion on an album. <br />12. Grey Seal-4/5.  This sounds like an early demo for a song that later appeared on \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\"  This version is okay, but the later version is excellent.  This one is very raw and stripped down. <br />13. Rock and Roll Madonna-3/5.  Standard boogie woogie piano type song.  Nothing special.  This was performed live. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent album with a couple of weak spots here and there.  Elton would really make the grade with his next album \\"Tumbleweed Connection.\\"  However, the good songs on here are among his very best.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|You know Into the Blue is going to be beautiful, both the stars and the scenery. That's a given.<br /><br />The surprise is that this thriller is actually quite good, better than more ambitious recent efforts like After the Sunset. Even if Jessica Alba and Paul Walker aren't big names like Sunset had, the plot is tighter and more plausible -- skin-divers looking for buried treasure exposed by a recent hurricane in the Bahamas find it, along with a nearby crashed plane full of cocaine -- and the actors throw themselves into the admittedly not-amazing dialogue with real commitment.<br /><br />The only real issue in the movie is that Paul Walker is apparently half-dolphin, able to hold his breath for a half-hour at a time. The first time he does this, another character is impressed that he can hold his breath for three minutes at a time. Later in the movie, they're all doing a lot more than that, in areas where they can't conveniently get more air, and no one seems to think it's remarkable at all. There's also several uncontrolled ascents that scuba divers will wince as they watch -- several of the characters should be laid up with the bends at different points in the movie, and possibly have serious damage to their hearing -- but otherwise, the filmmakers show a generally strong understanding of diving, both scuba and otherwise.<br /><br />This is a light and breezy entertainment, to be sure, but a better use of your time than most such films. A strong recommendation for scuba diving movie-watchers, those who just love tropical locations and, of course, anyone interested in lots of sequences of Jessica Alba in a bikini.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|After sitting through (suffering through, really) the last installment of Star Wars and the recent King Kong, with all their excessive CGI, poor character development and bad acting, I had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Lord of War on pay-per-view.<br /><br />Lord might have some detail inaccuracies (e.g. specific aspects of being an arms dealer or the function of Interpol), but it makes up for it in being dead on accurate when it comes to focusing like a laser on moral hypocrisy.  Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us fifty years ago that the military-industrial complex would threaten this country and our world.  While we've been sleeping this is exactly what has been happening.<br /><br />Lord of War takes this fact by focusing on a single man, Yuri, (played by Nicolas Cage) who is completely devoid of any moral concerns.  For example, in one scene a dictator - a potential buyer - uses one of Yuri's brand new weapons to kill a nearby dallying soldier.  Yuri screams in outrage and the dictator takes pause.  How does Yuri dare challenge his absolute power to do as he pleases?  Yuri then explains that he has now used the weapon and must now purchase it.  The dictator laughs and Yuri's character establishes his credibility to both the dictator and to us, the audience.  It's all about the product - the money - and ethical concerns are irrelevant.<br /><br />The last minute of the movie is an earth shattering statement about how the western world - those responsible for keeping peace and security in the world - are a central part of the problem of violence and war in this world.  Just like the excellent Three Kings, Lord of War is destined to be a classic satirical statement about our world.  While it might now have done well at the box office, it will surely be greatly admired years from now.<br /><br />In any other year Lord of War would be a moderately well made movie.  In this season of films over filled with CGI and characters we could care less about, it easily ranks as one the best of 2005.

B000002UJQ|5.0|As far as I can tell, MTV Supporter is a joke account created by a quite brilliant satirist (unfortunately the joke is at the expense of this masterwork's rating).  I really find it hard to believe that anyone would find the album to lack melodic hooks or verse-chorus structure (Paranoid Android and Fitter Happier are the only really off-the-wall tunes, and Android is amazingly memorable).  There are very few well-written negative reviews (kudos to Michael Scott for an excellent example of an eloquent one), and to be honest I'm not really in a place to deny that the music may be difficult to listen to.  I'm a huge electronic music fan, and in fact came at Radiohead from an electronic perspective and not a guitar-based or acoustic one.  What sounds like very traditional and beautiful music to me may be complete garbage to someone else. <br /> <br />That being said, I think that OK Computer is the best album ever created, simply because it is an amazing gateway into true appreciation of music.  Anyone who can enjoy the entirety of OK Computer (yes, including Fitter Happier ;)) is ready to explore more advanced music, but it's so accesible to Rock and Alternative audiences that it makes the transition easy.  Radiohead is really the dream of progressive music - appealing to the mainstream while maintaining absolute creative vision (which is sustained throughout the entire album).  I really think this is an amazing accomplishment, and it's what makes the record so special. <br /> <br />I would like to respond to a couple specific issues.  The first is with the lyrics.  I must admit, these are not typical Pop or Rock lyrics, nor are they easy to understand (in terms of meaning and wading through Yorke's accent and singing style).  However, it's a lot of fun to figure out where exactly the chicken voices are coming from, and what constitutes a Gucci little piggy.  Ultimately, the lyrics are a lot more like poetry than prose, which is just something we're not used to hearing in popular music.  They shouldn't discourage anyone, and they're really great fun to sing along to once you figure them out (if you can match Thom's range, which I can't).  It's interesting to read the band's commentary on the words and music, if you can find it ([...] is a great resource), and their insight might make it more meaningful to you.  To potential buyers - this is a very deep and insightful album!  Don't let the words scare you, the music is more important anyway. <br /> <br />Someone else had an issue with the sound of the cymbals, so I would like to address the production of the album.  Nigel Godrich is more or less a musical genius, literally.  He was in his 20's when he produced this album, and it certainly does NOT sound like it was produced in 1997.  The cymbals are a bit unusual, there's a lot of high-end and reverb, and they sound a bit harsh (similar effect on the \\"I lost myself\\" on Karma Police).  Yeah, it's harsh.  I don't like it, to be honest.  I don't think it's a glaring flaw, and not really noticable on low volumes and certain speakers.  It does sound really interesting, and maybe someday I'll learn to appreciate it as a drummer.  I sincerely doubt it's going to detract from anyone's listening experience, however.  The rest of the album is AMAZINGLY produced, tunes like Let Down and Karma Police are truly, truly beautiful, and Homesick Alien and The Tourist are totally otherworldly.  It's an completely unique and magical sound that like many have said was completely ahead of its time. <br /> <br />I'll wrap up now, since that ended up being about four times as long as I intended.  I wanted to put forth the theory that MTV Supporter was joking so people don't waste any time responding to him, and I had to defend some of the other things people attacked about the album, since I really and truly believe it's a masterful record.  I can't recommend it to everyone, but anyone who appreciates progressive, alternative, or even semi-traditionalRock should pick this up, as well as any fan of electronic music.  I suggest everyone else give it a try - if you don't like it, it will make a nice gift to a friend or relative who for some reason or another doesn't have it yet. <br /> <br />Look at me, I registered an account at Amazon to write a novel about a record.  Hope it was helpful to someone. :) <br /> <br />Enjoy, <br />-Troupe
0156027321|2.0|I had heard many great reviews of this book. \\"A book that will make you believe in God\\" -- now that's ambitious. A lot of pressure to put on 319 pieces of paper...too much pressure, it turns out. The hype behind this book falls way short of expectations and just doesn't deliver. I'm not one to read books on religion or spirituality, so I was skeptical from the get-go. I put this book down after 60 or so pages the first time I tried it. I only picked it up the second time because it was a book club selection. I enjoyed the introduction and the last 30 pages or so. The pages in between were extremely slow, often disgusting, and just painstakingly uninteresting to me. I didn't care about the habits of wild animals nor the beliefs or Hindus, Christians and Muslims (at least not in reading-for-pleasure). I was just bored. In the end, I am glad I stuck it out, but still can't say I really liked this novel too much. I know that the symbolism and deeper meaning of this novel is what is supposed to stay with you, and the slow passage of time (through the Pacific and through the lines of the book) are supposed to deliver you, in a way, to a rebirth of sorts in the end. I liked the way it came together, the questions it raised, and I think that maybe after discussing it with friends, I may find I got something out of it. The novel asks, \\"Which is the better story?\\" Unfortunately, I don't think Martel would like my answer. Oh well.
B00009Z576|3.0|I recall plucking this 1980 album out of a cut-out bin in 1981 upon the recommendation of a friend, and was instantly taken with the brooding Roger Dean landscape that sprawled across the cover.  Once I got home and the needle hit the vinyl I was mesmerized - the wall of sound ushered in with Steve Howes opening (semi-heavy metal) guitar part on the thunderous Machine Messiah is something that I will never forget.<br /><br />Remarkably, after the passage of over 25 years the music on Drama still sounds pretty darn good to me and certainly represents drummer Alan White and bassist Chris Squire at their tightest (although they were fairly tight on Tormato too).  At 10'27\\" Machine Messiah is the proggiest piece on the album with Tempus Fugit being the most explosive - Squire simply rips on this piece.  Come to think of it, Squire pretty much rips up and down and sideways on this album.  The absence of Jon Anderson on Drama is somewhat depressing I guess, but then this album was about transitioning into a new decade and the decision to go with the Buggles pop duo of keyboardist Geoff Downes and vocalist Trevor Horn was obviously deliberate.  In fact, Yes adopted a very heavy sound on this album, which may have represented an attempt to adopt the stylistic attributes of the (then) massively popular \\"stadium rock\\" bands like Boston or Journey.  Although I found this unthinkable back then (and even today), Squire allowed Trevor Horn to play bass on Run Through the Light, which signified a further move to make Yes sound less \\"Yessy\\".  I would eventually go on to explore definitive works like Close to the Edge (1972) and Relayer (1974), but never liked any album released by Yes following Drama.<br /><br />All in all, the Rhino remastering job is excellent, although I really could have done without the additional ten bonus tracks, which contain pieces taken from the wretched \\"Paris Sessions\\" along with various outtakes from the Drama sessions.  The liner notes are nicely detailed and there are photos of the band scattered throughout.e are photos of the band scattered throughout.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|obvisously the guy who wrote a review before this one is a jealous little brat who's in some lesser unknown new york band and can't stand to see the Strokes being successful. This new album is unbelieveable. I highly recommend it. The first track, \\"You Only Live Once\\" sounds alot like their older stuff, very cool groove. I admit im not a huge fan of Juicebox, kinda corny sounding. The highlights for me included, \\"Heart in a Cage\\", awesome drum beat leads the song, with a cool melodic vocal style. \\"On the Otherside\\" falls into another cool groove. The album highlight for me, is  \\"Ask Me Anything\\". This songs hot, it sounds like the Velvet Underground meets The Beatles. Check this album out if just for this song. \\"Killing Lies\\" is another great one, with tribal drums leading the way. Overall, i really enjoy this album and recommend it to any true strokes fans. This album shows them maturing into something very special.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Superior movie, perfect quality of sound and picture, perfect cast - amazing thing! It`s a masterpiece! Best movie of 2000 and more. There are a lot of historical mistakes, but this is not historical documentary. This is unforgettable journey to the Ancient Civilization of Roman Empire, world`s most advanced city of that time - Rome. Perfect actor skills of Russell Crowe make a special atmosphere of a strong and wise hero, whose family was murdered, but he will have his revenge. <br /> Extended Edition of Gladiator - many supplements that make this DVD more enjoyable. It`s hard to imagine all features of the extended version, you must see it. Buy it here for you collection. <br />
B00003CXI1|5.0|this movie , as well as the rest of the series, is not just for children. the actors fit the book characters perfectly-you will not be disappointed. <br />my favorite is by far alan rickman's professor severus snape, potions master and former death eater. he is elegant, sophisticated and downright sexy. <br /> my only criticism of the movie series is that they do not make enough use of mr. rickman's talent in the susequent movies.
6305907145|4.0|Unlike, say, 95% of the reviewers for this movie, I haven't read the book, and maybe that's why I'm giving it such high marks. <br /> <br />In the beginning of the movie, we meet Fanny who's the eldest daughter of an impoverished family (though the mother came from a middle class one) and she is being sent to live with her relatives. While she is kindly welcomed by the family, it's pretty clear that the differences in their social classes will always be evident, especially when it comes to her female cousins. <br /> <br />We later meet Edmund, her cousin and, in true 19th century British fashion, her love interest. Rather quickly, we're brought about ten years into the future where Fanny is around 20 years old and madly (though quietly) in love with Edmund and hopes that he'll realize he loves her, too. <br /> <br />With the entry of a well-to-do Henry and his sister, the comedy of errors is near complete. Henry is a playboy who, as Fanny realizes, craves attention and being loved. However much he flirts with her and her two cousins, she's still steadfast in her devotion to Edmund and refuses Henry's mulitiple offers of marriage--even when he follows her home from the Bertram's house to her family's dilapidated home on the docks. <br /> <br />While I'm somewhat familiar with other Austen works, it's clear that this movie has been shored up by vaguely modern characters, with modern viewpoints. In fact, I do find Fanny a bit more fiesty and steel-backed than is Austen's usual wont, but her moral fiber remains intact...even if the film's moral integrity seems a bit lacking. <br /> <br />The film blatantly points out the Bertram family's connection to the slave trade and we, quite shockingly, witness a nude scene (tame by modern standards) that Fanny takes quite well considering her gender and her time period. <br /> <br />Yet, despite the modern nuances evident in all aspects of the film, it's charm and Austen's wit are not to be overlooked. I like that there is dirt and grit in this film, unlike other squeaky-clean versions that would have us think this time period was nothing more than lilies and violet water. <br /> <br />The acting is solid and three-dimensional, the costuming and set design are authentic without being pretentious. <br /> <br />The only gripe that I have is that the romance between Edmund and Fanny is somewhat dull, though I have to admit, I find this in most adaptations of Austen's work (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" excluded). There's no spark between the two, in fact, the younger Edmund who meets Fanny as a child is more enthralling than the elder. <br /> <br />But still, Austen is read and loved for her witty intelligence as much as for the romance, so the film delivered in at least one aspect. Overall, it was an entertaining movie that I highly enjoyed, then again, I haven't read the book.
B000002HNR|5.0|While this album is a lot better than the EP \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" it's obvious that they left a few songs out. They have only a few songs from actual albums (they don't even have Light My Fire) and then segments from Celebration of the Lizard. This is a fantastic album if you ignore the previous detail about the song choices; Morrison's vocals are outstanding. I recently saw Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger live with their new band Riders on the Storm and they still kick a$$. <br />I'm also pretty sure that this is merely the first disc of the double live album.  <br /> <br />1. House Announcer-N/A-Kind of funny. It's a guy telling the audience to have people go back to their seats or there's no show. Just kind of interesting. <br />2. Who Do You Love-4/5-This song is OK, but it's obvious why The Doors never laid it down on album. <br />3. Alabama Song-5/5-It's a medley, but it's great. Well done. <br />4. Backdoor Man-5/5-A little extra guitar solo by Robbie Krieger. This is a great song...Obviously. Another damn medley. <br />5. Love Hides-5/5-This song was never put on album and I'm not sure why. The lyrics to this song kick major a$$. <br />6. Five to One-5/5-A little longer than the studio version; Morrison improvs on a few things here and it's really cool. <br />7. Build Me a Woman-5/5-Yet another song never put on album. I highly doubt if Morrison ever had the \\"poontang blues.\\" A great guitar solo is in this I might add. <br />8. When the Music's Over-5/5-One of their best songs. Jim Morrison always kicked a$$ at performing this song. During speaking parts not included in the studio version of the song he shows a really good sense of humor. <br />9. Close to You-5/5-Ray Manzarek on vocals and he's pretty good. I saw Manzarek sing \\"Alabama Song\\" with Riders on the Storm.  <br />10. Universal Mind-5/5-I was doing time in a universal mind. This is yet another song never put on album; But lyrically it's really great. <br />11. Petition the Lord With Prayer-5/5-Funny. Morrison screaming about petitioning the lord with prayer.  <br />12. Dead Cats, Dead Rats-5/5-It's more of a poem than an actual song and it's played with the beat from Break on Through. <br />13. Break on Through #2-5/5-Not sure why it's called Break on Through #2, it's the same song as just \\"Break on Through\\". <br /> <br />CELEBRATION OF THE LIZARD <br />14. Lions in the Street-5/5-Very cool. The beginning of the long poem. <br />15. Wake Up-5/5-Then it gets creepy. <br />16. A Little Game-5/5-\\"I want to play a little game. This is a game called go insane\\"...Or something like that. <br />17. The Hill Dwellers-5/5-Daughters smug with s**en eyes in their nipples. Lines just don't get much better than that. <br />18. Not To Touch the Earth-5/5-Featured on \\"Waiting for the Sun\\". This is an awesome song apart from Celebration. It's really great, really catchy. <br /> <br />19. Names of the Kingdom-5/5-I'm pretty sure this is not a part of COTL. It's great; Morrison speaks in a very sensual voice that's really cool. <br />20. The Palace of Exile-5/5-It's only like 46 seconds long, but then the crowd chants more which stretches it to a little over two minutes. What Morrison does say is very indian-like. <br />21. Soul Kitchen-5/5-Morrison's voice sounds a lot different then on the studio version; more tired and sensual. The song is exteneded to about 7 minutes, but it's really good. <br />A-

B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is an awesome movie. The main character Andy Duframe who was a banker doesn't seem like a bright person because of the way he acted when he had his trial. People don't know much about prison, they just know it's bad. This movie showed what the inside of a prison is like, and I haven't seen much movies do that lately. This movie sort of shows that a friend can really be something good to a person, because Red was a good friend to Andy and Andy seem to do fine and keep his sanity even in a prison. It is weird that Red is able to get all the stuff he gets from the outside world, when he's locked up in prison, like the tiny pickaxe and poster he got for Andy. I don't like the warden, because he made Andy still help him even though he shot an inmate that said Andy was innocent. Because of the warden's position, he gets to do whatever he wants with Andy because his position gives him the power. The movie was sad at times, and interesting at other times, like how Andy makes plans for 20 years and not gone insane from it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|'The Rise And Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars' was my introduction to David Bowie. It is a delicious, shimmering slice of pop perfection. The album is loosely based around the character of Ziggy Stardust, a rock n' rolling bisexual alien. However, contrary to popular belief, Ziggy was not intended to be a concept album at all! Songs such as 'Soul Love' and 'Suffragette City' as well as the last minute outtakes 'Round and Round' and 'Velvet Goldmine' do not enter into the story at all.  <br /> <br />The anthemic 'Five Years' is one of my all time favourite album openers. The lyrics are especially worth savouring, particularily when your brain feels like a warehouse and you're drinking milkshakes cold and long. Having only five years left to live has never been this much fun. The gourgeously melodic 'Soul Love' paves the way for Ziggy's grand entrance in 'Moonage Daydream.' Part \\"space invader\\", part \\"rock n' rolling bitch\\", Ziggy wreaks havoc amongst Mick Ronson's swirling guitar solo. The first single 'Starman' borrows the melody from Over the Rainbow and basically blows our minds. Bowie's cover version of 'It Ain't Easy' and 'Lady Stardust', an ode to Marc Bolan round out the middle of the album. The second half of the album is more kinetic and frantically paced than the first. Ziggy declares his ambition to become a \\"rock and roll star\\" and delights in his growing fame in 'Star' and 'Hang on To Yourself.' Another anthem, 'Ziggy Stardust' describes the tragic downfall of Ziggy at the hand of his jealous bandmembers the Spiders from Mars. After ripping through the all out rocker 'Suffragette City', 'Rock N' Roll Suicide' sadly laments Ziggy's death.  <br /> <br />This was my first Bowie album and will always hold a very special place in my heart. Some regard this as his finest album. Although I think this is a brilliant piece of work, in my opinion Bowie had yet to reach greater heights. Nevertheless, very highly recommended and a magical introduction to an amazing artist.
0553804367|5.0|I read the earlier book, \\"A Brief History of Time\\" by Hawking and this book delivers where it states, in updating where things have advanced as well as putting the cookies on the lower shelf by writing conversationally and without the use of academic verbiage and mathmatical equations that would be lost on the general audience it targets.<br /><br />What criticisms can no doubt be leveled for it's simplicity, are somewhat specious because its simplicity is the point.<br /><br />The explanations offered for the creation of stars, black holes, white holes, dark energy, dark matter, parrallel dimensions and universes and the possibility of time travel are fascinating and very enlightening.  Science indeed has come a long way in a relatively (pun intented) brief (second pun also intended) period of time.<br /><br />I applaud Hawking and those in his field with their progress and discoveries.  They are indeed exciting.<br /><br />I don't tend to put the same amount of faith into Stephen Hawking's belief that Physics is on the verge of coming up with a \\"Grand Unified Theory\\" that explains every element of the beginnings, development and sustenance of the universe.  I tend to believe that as more answers are found, there will be new questions raised and that we may well find ourselves in the paradox of the finite seeking to comprehend and grasp the infinite.  In that regard, I find Hawking's goals and beliefs, while laudable, somewhat unrealistic.  That is not unexpected because what Hawking is doing here is pushing right up on the border of Physics with Metaphysics.  Science can answer \\"what\\" and \\"how,\\" but it will forever be limited to answer \\"why\\".<br /><br />A prime example of this is when Hawking in effect dabbles in the realm of predestination speculating as to the possibility of all biological action, development and even thought as explainable should formulas be determined for the random possibilities.  Interesting.  Welcome to the realm of Reformed Theology approached through a different venue but with the same mysteries for which there is no apparent satisfying answer, Mr Hawking!  ;)<br /><br />I do not doubt or discount the need to continue the attempt to reduce the universe to complete scientific equation and understanding. I came away from this book excited at the progress, curious as to future developments and very much better for the time and effort expended.<br /><br />This is a keeper and I will reread it.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|I had high hopes for first impressions. Being a fan of the infectious juicebox, I had no idea of what to expect from the album. The first four songs are ultimately decent, reflective of the previous albums. However, the latter ten strike me somewhat as fillers. Though not terrible, the larger portion of the album is a tad weak. I had hoped for more. However, the Strokes are still a pretty strong indie garage band, they just decided to wander into new territory on this one, not a bad idea, but I think they could have played it off better. A disappointment? No, it just wasn't what I expected. The highlights on first impressions (tracks 1-4) are good songs and the rest are listenable, but I still feel that this is their worst album (although is this it and room on fire were great albums). I would recommend feeling the water before diving right in.

6304493665|4.0|My impressions of Matthew Poncelet changed significantly throughout the film. At the beginning, he was more of an arrogant racist like all the other convicted murderers on death row that deserved the pain of death. However, I found it so intriguing at the same time, to find Sister Helen Prejean being his spiritual advisor in defending him. It made me think, that whether the man was misunderstood by society or accused in a righteous way, it was devastating to see that at the end of the film, he sincerely apologized to the victim's relatives. It seemed clear to me that though Matthew was very detestable, Sister Helen was still as strong to offer love to such a killer. That probably the whole purpose of her advising him wasn't to save a life, but to teach the sinner what he did was wrong. The minutes before the execution left me so emotional, to see such a lonely and frightened sinner (like every individual on the face of this planet is), being truly sorry for his actions. I highly recommend everyone to watch this film.   <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I read Lawrence Bernabo's prominate review. I agree with most of his assertions regarding many aspects of the film, especially killing off people who were supposed to survive, like Menelaos for one. He was to return and rule with his contrite wife Helen. Who would Telemachos, from the Odyssey, visit when in search of his father ten years later? I highly disagree with the idea of leaving out the GODS--it was so clearly a part of what motivated, protected and tricked the heroes. Their presence would have explained so much. Without Aphrodite, how does Paris get out of the battle with Menelaos? The mystical element would have deepended the storyline and intensified many scenes. Why butcher Homer so badly? Can you imagine what it would have been like to see Athena whip Achilles's (Brad Pitt's) head back warning him about using his anger to murder Agamemnon? And if Paris is such a whimp, it would only make sense that Helen would follow him because Aphrodite had assisted him. It also would have added a much needed layer to Paris's character. He had been a shepard for most of his life, not a prince. No matter how many times Peterson goes back to rework his movie--he can't undo the story damage. Yes, the battle scenes are great, Achilles is certainly well cast in Brad Pitt--remember he was supposed to be pretty enough to pass for a girl. And that they made his most treasured friend his cousin? Are we so uptight that we can't show affection and bonds between men who fight and train together? The love that ripped Achilles heart out was the loss of Patroklos. It was the final piece in the unraveling of Achilles's character. The \\"cousin\\" element was never what Homer had envisioned. When a director takes THIS much license with a major story, it makes it impossible to tell the second part through film without people scratching their heads.<br /><br />I do agree that the less you know about the actual story, the more you will most likely enjoy it. I've watched this DVD several times, each time hoping to enjoy it better than the last. I just can't seem to love it as much as I did Alexander or the TV version of the Odyssey, which was rather under-cooked.[[ASIN:0976519224 Waiting for Odysseus]]time hoping to enjoy it better than the last.

I didn't know who it was or the song title, but I knew I had to get it. The next day I did. The entire CD reminds me of the folk singers' lyrics of the 60s and 70s era, a poetic style different from the growing rock 'n roll sound. Musically James Blunt has entwined the adult alternative rock vibe--simple arrangements-- with his angelic and haunting voice.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|This album is definitely good; the one thing I find faulty in it is that after every listen I find myself saying \\"it's just not as good as Transatlanticism!\\" <br />I think the opening 2 songs are the strongest on the album, followed by \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed.\\" Personally, I don't find any head-haunters on the album like \\"Title & Registration,\\" \\"Expo 86,\\" \\"Tiny Vessels\\" or \\"We Looked Like Giants.\\" There are alot more memmorable tunes on Transatlanticism, and even The Photo Album, than on Plans. Nuff said. <br />But Death Cab is always quality
B00006CXXU|5.0|Well, when this first came out, i wasn't impressed. I thought she looked like a s***, and was really bearing it all with her video \\"Dirty\\". However, when i revisited it recently, I actually ended up excepting it for what it was...a beautifully written and unique album. I can see why she dressed the way she did, and now, at an older age, i have no problem with this! I know she's working on a new album, and I think it's going to be pretty hard to top this one.
B000BTGY7I|1.0|My god, people... How many of these do we have to put up with?? I mean, I'm a huge fan of this friggin' movie but didn't I already buy a 2nd Special Edition of sorts with the \\"Single Disc\\" that included a bunch of goodies. <br /> <br />I hate to use the words \\"rip-off\\" or \\"money-grubbing\\" when it comes to DVD editions of movies like this that I love because I'm usually the biggest sucker, but gimme a break here...
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This DVD is above all, an absolute classic. It will keep you on the edge of your chair through out the whole flick. This is one of those films that will keep you from pausing it to go to the bathroom. It keeps you interested all the time. I could watch it over and over.
B00005JOFO|5.0|like many other people have written this movie is a lot more than a couple of gay cowboys.  this is a testament to the type of hold love can have on people, especially when it comes from the most unexpected places.  it also speaks loads about the way some places in america engender a way of thinking.  ennis is the prime example of this thinking.  as a boy he was shown a hate crime by his father and to ennis that is what will happen to him if he and jack twist were to be together.  although ennis does not speak very much, when he does open his mouth he means what he says.  he is the type of character that really does think before he speaks and acts.  he is a very simple man, but on the inside he is full of conflict.  everything is very basic and straightforward, he knows what he can and cant do.  he really only comes out of his shell and is his true self only when he believes that people are not looking.  ennis is the realist and jack is the optimist.  jack can see them together and wants them to be together.  he sees a future for them and is completely crushed every time he has to leave ennis because it can never be how he wants it to.  ennis states that \\"if you cant fix it then you have to stand it.\\"  that is the truest statement in the movie.  it holds true for both men, but it seems to manifest in different ways for them.  this movies gathers it's power from basic human needs.  the whole relationship stems from the need to be with another person, not only emotionally but physically as well.  both men are thrown together and the reason they turn to each other is because they only have each other.  the fact that each man realizes that the love they share is pure is also the root of their torment.  both do what is expected of them from society, married and children, however neither one can really shake the other.  both men hold onto the love that they share.  both of their lives would be simpler if they could let each other go but love in its most basic form will not release them from it's bonds.  eventually one falls to the reality that ennis fears the most, and in my opinion the other is left to regret not being able to have said goodbye or for that matter be with the one person he truly loved.  everything about this movie is moving.  i think that it is a shame that heath ledger is garnering most of the attention for this movie.  i do not mean that he does not do a good job, he is excellent as ennis del mar.  however, there are two actors in this movie and jake gyllenhall deserves just as much praise as ledger.  i think that this movies stands a very good chance to capture the oscar for best picture and i think that it would be a great day if a movie dealing with gay issues of this magnitude would be step forward in the constant war of equal rights.  this movie shows that there is love between same sexes and the only reason that it is hidden is because society cant handle what it finds different and i think that this movie shows that love is love no matter who you give it to and who it is shared with.
0307236722|4.0|I got this book for Christmas.  It's beautiful!  I too have been a MS fan forever.  But, I made the pound cake recipe, baked as specified, and, when it was supposed to be done, the cake was nowhere close to done!  I'll reserve any further criticisms until I try more recipes...

B00005JOIF|5.0|this movie revolves around religion.  it goes back to the fight between isreal and palestine.  it is a fight over land and a place to call home and religion and to me everything that religion should not stand for.  the plot of this movie revolves around the munich olympics and the murder of the isreali team.  isreal retaliates by assassinating figures that supposedly had a hand in the planning of the munich massacre.  this team is thrown together because each has a specialty that will help eliminate each target.  eric bana plays avner and does an excellent job.  this team operates like a family and are very close to each other, and they are the heart and soul of the movie.  however, to me this movie poses the question how far should people have to go to show loyalty and love for their country.  especially when maybe your country is not completely honest about what your mission is.  the planning and execution of each assassination is very interesting to watch and come to fruition.  often times this movies is very visceral, i mean this in the way that spielberg puts you right in there with the action, the explosions, and the heartache.  i had instant tears when avner hears his daughters voice over the phone, i felt his pain and i saw it in his face and to me it was very real.  the movie is also very visceral at the end when you see the isrealis murdered.  as you watch the movie, think about what is going on.  those men were murdered for no tangible reason other than where they were born and the religion they were born into.  when they are killed tears returned to my eyes, the maliciousness, the hate, the anger, the unnecessariness of the whole situation was too much.  they did not need to die, and it makes me sad, that is as simply as i can put it, i feel pity for people who are blind to what they are taking away when they murder in the name of religion.  sometimes i feel that religion causes more problems than it solves.  i have so much respect for spielberg right now because of the last scene in the movie.  as the credits role look in the skyline and you will see the twin towers standing .  to me it is very important to apply the ideas of this movie and then see how they relate to what happened on 9/11.  the events of 9/11 are incredibly similar to the events of the muncih olympics.  a needless attack over a war that is hard to pinpoint.  and why did this happen, for me it is all about religion and how people feel the need to kill in order to contradict the peace that religion is supposed to bring to humanity.  good for you steven spielberg, i hope to see even more movies like this from you, he got this one right and i hope that people appreciate the message that it delivers.

B00001NFCY|1.0|(...)It really sucks, simple as that. That moaning of Scott Stapp, those lyrics of Scott Stapp. Ugh, SCOTT STAPP! It seems that anything he touches turns to crap. Let's not forget Celebrity Poker.  By the time this album came out, it was pretty much confirmed that Scott Stapp and his Creed cohorts were nothing more than a sappy music rendering, trying to be sensitive, poop band. \\"Not so fast...\\" moans Stapp. Early in the album is the \\"hit\\" song \\"What if\\". This song showed us that Creed still had some edge to them. The only problem was that the lyrics really didn't enhance this listening experience. I know the song is called \\"What if\\"; I don't need the phrase said 64 times.  And another thing. The first time I heard Creed, I could have sworn I was listening to Pearl Jam, bad Pearl Jam. Apparently I wasn't the first to make this comparison, and the band knew it. That guitarist, what's his face, I don't know, even had the gall to say the following: \\"Eddie Vedder wishes he could write a song as good as Scott Stapp.\\" Well, Scott Stapp wishes he could sing in a way so people don't think he's ripping off Eddie Vedder, which he's clearly doing.
B000001EXR|4.0|Prior to the reunion of the original line-up and seemingly endless tour that followed, KISS decided to show they could be as contemporary as the grungers of the period (1995).  What could have been a cheap derivative in other bands' hands became the heaviest album KISS ever delivered, the Seattle influence present but not dominating.  Riffs are more in the early Black Sabbath vein, but the chord work is definitely grungey in its downtuned guitars.  Bruce Kulick saves the day, keeping his chops at the front, as if to say \\"I can play the dropped \\"D\\" tuning just like you flannel punks, but can you do this?\\" before burning off great soloes that know when to stop being vehicles for showing off and keeping the melody in mind.<br /><br />  Sales for this CD weren't exactly stellar, but judged on its own merits, \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" is a damn good riff heavy and smart album.  I have no problem believing KISS could do whatever they set their minds to, judged by the evidence on this platter.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Dark Water<br /><br />Suffering through a bitter custody battle, Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) have moved into a rundown New York City apartment to start a new life. The place, run by an eccentric manager (a scene-stealing John C. Reilly), and an even stranger superintendent (Pete Postlethwaite), isn't very welcoming, but Dahlia decides to give it her best shot. Mysterious occurrences start arriving with the appearance of a leaky ceiling in the apartment that drips black water. The water soon starts to appear everywhere to Dahlia, leading her to the brink of sanity. She tries to hold it together for Ceci, but the young girl is also dealing with the haunted surroundings, and the sinister nature of her new imaginary friend.<br /><br />Just glancing at \\"Dark Water\\" you can feel a wince coming on. The latest entry in the Japanese horror remake fiesta, \\"Water\\" comes to American shores with an ace up its sleeve: filmmaker Walter Salles. Directly off his international sensation, \\"The Motorcycle Diaries,\\" the Brazilian director comes to this remake of the 2002 horror hit with some bright ideas on mood and suspense. After watching \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" (along with some other knock-offs) go horribly wrong, it's a small treat to see \\"Dark Water\\" translate so well to these shores.<br /><br />We've seen it before: ghost kids, spooky corners, imposing faucets. \\"Dark Water\\" doesn't feature too many firsts in its plot. Salles steps up to this challenge by forcing the material to bend to his will, creating a sensational mood of emotional destruction, baked with a crust of paranoia. \\"Water\\" isn't necessarily a \\"boo!\\" experience like the marketing suggests; Salles is much more interested in detailing the emotional seam bursting that is consuming Dahlia, and her decent into madness and guilt. No actress in the world is better suited for this gloomy journey than Jennifer Connelly, who is pitch-perfect in her role here. Salles smothers the film in darkness and moisture, weaving a mysterious, suspenseful vibe. Connelly is right there to back him up at every turn, providing a strong human core to the fantastical surroundings, and brilliantly matching the dark tone Salles is methodically arranging.<br /><br />\\"Water\\" eventually succumbs to the obvious when ghost children start running around and the scare factor is turned up. Salles himself doesn't appear too interested in giving his audience the willies, but he does score an awesome climax, which is both unexpected and astonishing, considering this project comes from Disney. I can forgive some rather inane leaps at spooks when the ending is this good.<br /><br />Salles is even able to make his film compelling after original director Hideo Nakata stole most of the ideas for his \\"Ring Two\\" sequel from earlier this year. \\"Water\\" and \\"Two\\" have so much in common, I'm shocked lawsuits weren't filed. At the end of the day, Salles is just so much more interesting a filmmaker than Nakata, and he finds magic by making d&eacute;j&agrave; vu seem brand spanking new.<br /><br />\\"Dark Water\\" is familiar material twisted into interesting directions, and even if it doesn't always succeed dramatically, the attempt is clear, and I appreciate the film for that alone. I hope Salles takes more dips in the Hollywood pool in the future.m in darkness and moisture, weaving a mysterious, suspenseful vibe.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<br /><br />Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) plan to spruce up his chocolate business is to plant five golden tickets randomly in his Wonka bars inviting the holders to a tour of his factory. For poor Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore, \\"Finding Neverland\\"), chances for a ticket are slim, but luck is on his side; joining spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive Violent Beauregard (Annasophia Robb), perpetually consuming Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), and violent Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry), Charlie meets Wonka, the reclusive, eccentric fellow behind the delights of his factory. As the tour commences, weird things start happening to the selfish, misbehaving children, leaving Charlie alone to deal with Wonka's bizarre behavior, and to try to help him out.<br /><br />If not exactly a classic film, Mel Stuart's 1971 fantasy creation, \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" has stood the test of time with its tender realization of childhood sugar fantasies and morbid, goofball humor. With Gene Wilder at the helm of the considerable steerage of oddities, this loose Roald Dahl adaptation has aged as a major 1970s peculiarity, yet, at the same time, remained wonderful. Over 30 years later, noted quirkmeister Tim Burton has taken up the challenge to bring the book (with the true \\"Charlie\\" title) to the screen again, and he's out to reclaim the cinema version for himself.<br /><br />Immediately, comparing the two productions becomes a fruitless quest. The Stuart film was made in an era of musicals, practical effects, and gee-whiz kid acting. Burton's film exists in a more cynical time, with a more sarcastic filmmaker. Opening with Danny Elfman's familiar scoring backing the creation, by cold steel machines, of the Wonka bars, the tone is clearly set: this is no candy shop, and the candy man can't. Burton has more in store for his audience than simple sweets and soft-shoe.<br /><br />With a rapturous and meticulous production design, a tongue firmly placed in cheek, and the appearance of Christopher Lee as Willy's dentist dad, this is a Burton film through and through. That being established, \\"Charlie\\" is a chilly affair, more concerned with technical prowess than heart or plot. For the most part, this change in focus is fine, for Burton's take on Willy's chocolate factory is a marvel, packed with infinite candy rooms, singing, dancing, cocoa-bean worshiping Oompa Loompas (all played by movie MVP, Deep Roy, \\"The Neverending Story\\"), and legitimate danger. While a lot of the film is sweetened with CGI, Burton still palms the primal magic of Wonka's wonderland with his extensive visuals, and the depth and life he gives the factory is almost perfect.<br /><br />Almost perfect can also be said of Johnny Depp, who steps out of the mile-long shadow of Gene Wilder to fashion his own twisted take on Willy. Since the aim for \\"Charlie\\" isn't pointed at the heart, Depp's Wonka is a strange fellow who hates parents, is easily annoyed by children, and appears to be a germaphobe. Not exactly the winking teddy bear Wilder went after in his legendary performance, but Depp's oddball acting fits heavenly with Burton's vision, and the two team up yet again for another rousing, wildly original collaboration.<br /><br />However, with Depp and the computer effects taking the lead, poor little Charlie isn't left with much to do. Freddie Highmore is an inspired choice for the unlikely Golden Ticket winner, and his English puppy dog demeanor does the film a world of good in the emotion department. But Burton keeps Charlie at arm's length for the entire film, along with the other kid actors (who aren't nearly as interesting or natural as Highmore), leaving unfair comparisons to the stellar child acting work in the original incarnation to dance through the head.<br /><br />Tim Burton's \\"Charlie\\" corrects many mistakes from the Stuart film (the Oompas aren't creepily orange and green anymore, and Burton has mercifully done away withthe infamously bizarre, psychedelic boat trip sequence), along with raising the epic visual stakes for the more visionary angles of the story that needed it. Burton has created a genuinely fun movie for the family, blessed with a zippy running time, and those tired of the Wilder warmth for this often ominous tale will rejoice over this new icy stab at detailing Wonka's outrageous tour.ully done away with the infamously bizarre, psychedelic boat trip sequence), along with raising the epic visual stakes for the more visionary angles of the story that needed it.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|Terry Gilliam, the only American member of the Monty Python troupe, and director of such quirky classics as \\"Brazil,\\" \\"Time Bandits,\\" \\"The Fisher King,\\" \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" \\"The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen\\" and \\"Monty Python & The Holy Grail,\\" among others, does it again with bizarre combination of Munchausen and Tim Burton's \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" with a little bit of \\"The Village\\" thrown in.<br /><br />This dark-humored film relates the completely-fictional story of the famous German brothers, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jakob (Heath Ledger) Grimm, who created dozens of fairy tales and nursery stories for children in the early 19th Century. True to Gillian's idiosyncratic style, though, the movie plays nothing straight down the line. In this case, the brothers are con artists, traveling through the French-occupied German villages (remember Napoleon was big in those days) and playing on the fears and superstitions of their idiot occupants.<br /><br />Wearing goofy armor, shouting made-up incantations, and using hidden assistants, sleight of hand and other trickery, they fool these hicks into paying them big money, that is until they are finally captured by French forces, and sent to a town where several young girls have gone missing. The two arrive with little fanfare, as well as several French soldiers and Cavaldi (Peter Stormare, \\"Birth,\\" \\"Bad Boys 2\\"), the evil Italian inquisitor of Gen. Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce, \\"Brazil\\") to try and solve the mystery. If they fail, they will be tortured and executed.<br /><br />Since, of course, they are fakes, they have no idea what they're doing but, with the assistance of a female trapper, they discover a crumbling tower deep within a foreboding forest. The woman remembers her father telling her the story of an evil queen who sealed herself up there to avoid a plague that was killing her subjects. It seems this tower and whatever now lives inside of it may be the cause of all the trouble.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" the two have gadgets and inventions which were far ahead of their time (and thus completely illogical to those around them). Their efforts to solve the disappearances are clumsy and awkward, but somehow they stumble onto clue after clue. All the while they exchange silly and witty bon mots while trying to outsmart the bad guys and themselves. Even better performances come from Pryce and especially Cavaldi, who is evil, smarmy and pathetic.<br /><br />Always a stickler for historic details, Gilliam's costumes and set design are perfect for 1804 Europe (the film was shot in Prague), when Napoleon was at the peak of his powers and the continent was pretty much under French control.<br /><br />Weaved throughout the film are any number of the Grimm fables, including \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" \\"Rapunzel,\\" \\"The Frog Prince,\\" \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" \\"Hansel And Gretel\\" and \\"The Gingerbread Man,\\" among others, while the iconoclastic Gilliam throws in subtle and not-too-subtle jokes, dialogue and situations.<br /><br />Here, many who may not understand or appreciate the director's roots, may turn away and condemn the project, misinterpreting Gilliam's often-frantic camera-work and reliance on special effects as a metaphor for his lack of vision or ingenuity. Nothing could be further from the truth. \\"Grimm,\\" while certainly not up to the standards set in some of his earlier work, is nonetheless an interesting, creative and visually-intriguing film. Yes, it does tend to bog down every now and then, while the violent comedy, at times, is a bit forced, but, overall, that detracts little from the entire film.g heavily from \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" the two have gadgets and inventions which were far ahead of their time (and thus completely illogical to those around them).

B0001I55OC|3.0|First of all, we have Paul Walker in the \\"lead\\" role.  Secondly, this is, after all, a movie that was based on a book (enough warning in itself to expect disappointment) that was written just a few years before the movie came to theaters, a good sign of a typical Hollywood rush job, complete with the usual inconsistencies and lousy script.  This movie, in many ways, is no exception, so you should know what you're getting yourself into.  I would humbly suggest to anyone that low expectations are the best way to go if you're actually willing to spend two hours of your time watching a film that showcases the afore-mentioned flashing red lights.<br /><br />Now, with these in mind, one might be ready to enjoy the gems within this movie!  Billy Connolly played the vibrant professor wonderfully; I just wish they had given him more to work with.  The REAL stars of this movie were Gerard Butler, a dashing young actor whom I had never heard of before this movie, and Anna Friel, whose small role is delivered with sparks, and whose face makes one want this movie to be a romance rather than a sub-par action flick.  We would all be very fortunate to see more of her in the near future.  These exciting performances almost manage to save the movie, and certainly bring it above the level of a complete \\"timewaste\\".
0553801503|1.0|All I can say is, I'm glad that, unlike so many frustrated Martin fans, I didn't wait five years for this book to emerge.  I started this series a couple of years ago - after I abandoned Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' for the same reason I will now abandon Martin -  failing to satisfy his readers. <br /> <br />The author has now joined the ranks of the 'kitchen sink' school of writing.  While abandoning the important characters that we had grown to love (or hate) he elects to throw in so many new - and unnecessary - faces that it all dissolves into a meaningless clutter.  Nothing will jolt a reader out of a story worse than having to constantly refer to an appendix to try to keep track of 'who's who' - which I did several times before I finally decided that the plot wasn't worth the effort.  Martin writes page after page of meaningless drivel, while failing to resolve any of the issues that readers wanted resolved.   <br /> <br />I had taken the title 'A Feast for Crows' to mean that the epic battle for the Iron Throne would be fought in this book, leaving the vanquished lying on the battlefield - 'a feast for crows'.  I'm sure the author knew this as well, but I wonder if he knew how many readers were going to be so thoroughly dissatisfied with what emerged.  Martin has written a very boring book and neglected the really signifcant characters from his previous works (those that he hadn't already killed off).  I doubt the promised sequel will be any better.   <br /> <br />I feel intellectually (as well as financially) cheated by Martin's latest offering and he has lost me as a fan. For those who insist on sticking with this never-ending saga, I say, don't waste your money on this one.  Any synopsis on the net will suffice.  Sad to see, but Martin has joined the ranks of those who choose to keep a story going long after it should have been concluded, simply for the cash flow, with no regard for the reader's desires.  I have had enough. <br /> <br />Dr. F. Batton

Three I consider beyond outstanding because they make me tingle inside: \\"The Collector,\\" \\"Beside you in Time,\\" and  \\"Right Where it Belongs.\\" The intense lyrics and the techno rhythms is the reason I enjoy listening to the Nine Inch Nails.

I actually feared that the film would be worse than the Joel \\"I have to show Batman and Robin's butt every chance I can for some stupid-ass reason\\" Schumacher films. However, after reading articles in Wizard Magazine and seeing the film's preview, I got very excited. And when I actually saw the film, I was blown away. This is not just the BEST Batman film I've seen but (along with \\"Sin City\\") the BEST comic book movie I've ever seen. What I loved most was that there was serious character development. This was not just quick action and meaningless fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, the action was there, and was terrific, but it made sense with the story. Chris Nolan and the others responsible for the film obviously had done their homework. Taking the best from Batman comics (more than just the look-but the story) and making one MOTHER of a great movie out of them. (Most notably they borrowed a great deal from Frank Miller's \\"Batman Year One\\" which is one of the greatest Batman comics I've ever read.)  <br /> <br />After Joel \\"I'm of the opinion that more florescent lights and awful casting will make Batman movies better\\" Schumacher, Chris Nolan has actually renewed my faith that Batman films could be good again so much that I eagerly anticipate their sequels. This film is so good that even my wife, who is not a comic or Batman fan, likes it very much. It is great! Great story, great characters, great action, great look and feel, and great casting and acting. If you are thinking about buying this movie, buy it now. You will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Caesar says two thumbs way up! <br />

The mark of a great filmmaker usually lies in how well he is able to illuminate a complex subject for a less-than-enlightened or essentially uninformed audience.  In this case, however, writer/director Stephen Gaghan's refusal - or is it inability? - to unravel the entanglements in his narrative somehow works in the movie's favor.  Is it because the subject matter itself is so messy and incoherent that the presentation of it needs to be as well?  Whatever the case, \\"Syriana\\" is a wholly riveting and absorbing cinematic experience - even if only a tiny percentage of it makes any real sense.  (And don't forget that coherence of plot, in and of itself, is not necessarily a prerequisite for a quality film.  After all, it`s widely admitted that the screenplay for \\"The Big Sleep\\" is virtually impossible to figure out, yet that film is considered a classic).<br /><br />Based on the book by Robert Baer, Gaghan's tale takes us to the dark heart of international oil politics, where strategies are planned and deals are struck, often at the expense of individual freedoms and the snuffing out of thousands of innocent lives.  Gaghan shows us the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, power politics, corporate corruption, governmental malfeasance, human exploitation and personal betrayals that go into filling up the gas tanks of our SUVs.  In this turbulent Middle Eastern world of sectarian strife, arms deals and acts of terror, Gaghan finds little room for good guys or heroes, although he does imply that heroic ACTS may indeed be possible.  Instead, he shows how all of us, to some degree or another, share in this shame.<br /><br />Rather than taking a purely linear approach in his narrative (which would certainly have made things more understandable) , Gaghan, as he did in \\"Traffic,\\" provides us with an assortment of characters and storylines that often seem arbitrary and disconnected from one another.  This is primarily why the confusion arises, for we are often whisked from one subplot to another before the first has been fully explicated.  The film is something like a mosaic; it doesn't really matter if every single detail doesn't attain complete clarity as long as we are able to pull back and focus our eyes on the big picture Gaghan shows us.<br /><br />There's not much point in trying to relate the fine points of the complex plot here.  Suffice it to say that the film is filled with vivid scenes and memorable moments, as well as outstanding performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, Kayvan Novak, Amr Waked and many others.<br /><br />By plunging headlong into the most timely and important issue of our time - the violent clash between Western secularism and Muslim extremism - \\"Syriana\\" certainly establishes itself as one of the bravest and best movies of 2005.  However, it may take a few additional viewings on the part of the head-scratchers to convince THEM of that./> <br />Rather than taking a purely linear approach in his narrative (which would certainly have made things more understandable) , Gaghan, as he did in \\"Traffic,\\" provides us with an assortment of characters and storylines that often seem arbitrary and disconnected from one another.

B00006L83N|5.0|'The Odyssey' is possibly the greatest Symphony X album ever released.  I've been following the band ever since I heard \\"Out of the Ashes\\" from the 'Divine Wings' album, and I've gotten every album since then.  I appreciated the experimental side to 'V', but I felt it focused too much on symphonic overtones.  Was this the new direction that Symphony X was going for?  I had thought so, and while I was perfectly capable of accepting a symphonic edge to the band, I was a guitar freak at heart.  Then came 'The Odyssey'; featuring a perfect blend of wall-to-wall guitar and keyboards, this release showcased the melodic and technical capabilities of the band while not completely doing away with the symphonic overtones featured on 'V'.  I had the pleasure of talking to Michael Lepond (bassist) after it was released, and although he was a bit disappointed with the level of his bass in the mix - and I'll admit, it's a little low, but not as bad as Metallica's  '...And Justice For All' - he was proud of the product.  I took his opinion seriously, but I wanted to hear for myself.  When it came out in stores, I (regretfully) went for the non-limited edition.  Looking back, I should have waited for the special edition to be stocked, because it includes one extra song, but I wanted to hear the material right away.<br /><br />So I bought the album and fed it into the CD player.  Out blasted a frenetic sequence of guitar notes, the intro of \\"Inferno\\", to set the stage of the album.  While I would hardly call \\"Inferno\\" my favorite song on the disk, it did leave an impact.  Then I hit \\"Wicked\\", an awesome, slow-driving song which remains at the top of my Symphony X song list ever since hearing it; Russell Allen's vocal work shines on that song.  Whoever calls \\"Awakenings\\" a weak ballad must be ignorant (in my opinion).  The song starts off with a syncopated introduction between the bass, drums, and keyboards, and goes through a transformation as distorted guitars are added in; very symphonic and pleasant sounding.<br /><br />Then I reached the title track, a 24-minute long epic called \\"The Odyssey\\".  Split into seven parts, the song begins with an orchestrated session (accentuated with some heavy guitars and drums) that sounds like it came right out of a movie.  Around the four minute mark, Michael Romeo sets his guitar on clean and brings the song into a peaceful-sounding interlude with Russell Allen.  Later in the song, you'll hear an answer to that same part, but not before encountering heavy guitars at the 6-minute mark, vocal-layering and pulsating keyboards at the 13-minute mark, a bumbling guitar stampede at the 15-minute mark, and another orchestrated session at the 17.  Despite the diversity mentioned here, the song flows very well for the most part, and it could very well make the album deserving of five stars in itself if it were offered as a single.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this is Symphony X's most solid attempt.  Offering a great blend of symphony and guitar, I gave this album the highest rating available.  Great album; truly a must-have.symphonic and pleasant sounding. <br /> <br />Then I reached the title track, a 24-minute long epic called \\"The Odyssey\\".

B000002UA2|5.0|What's most amazing about this album is they wrote and recorded it in a couple of weeks. This tight sounding soundtrack album is the most underrated of all of pink floyds output. For guitar fans, this album contains some of David Gilmours best pre-dark side of the moon guitar solos. Free Four, the song that, as far as I'm concerned, set Roger Waters Lyrical direction for the next decade, could have and should have been a pink floyd pop hit. This album should be owned by any real pink floyd fan because this was the pink floyd album that didn't worry about concepts and just let the music do the talking. So pop this in the CD player, sit back, crack open a cold one, and enjoy.  <br />P.S. How can you just own Dark Side of the Moon without wanting to buy the whole set? I've never been able to figure that one out.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I remember very well when this CD came out. I was just getting into rock music and I heard Nookie and Faith and fell in love with Bizkit. The times were good for a Bizkit type music fan too. Family Values 99 was coming, Korn was about to release Issues, and MTV still played some rock videos and did interesting things, for example right before Signifigant Other came out, MTV had that spring break thing and Limp played and blew up the boat. When I listen to this album, I cant help but smile at all the memories of that time, because honestly, I thought 1999 was overall a good year for music and concerts. Then Chocolate Starfish came out.........
B000024D4R|5.0|Admittedly, it took me a while to get into this album. I listened to it, after I bought it, expecting another listener friendly album the likes of DSOTM or the Wall, and found this one to be rather tedious to begin with. In fact, I was downright intimidated, buy the 17 minute Magna Opus \\"Dogs\\", and skipped to the next song 5 minutes into it. That was then, though, and this is now. About five years after purchasing Animals I listened to Roger Waters Version of \\"Dogs\\" on his \\"In the Flesh\\" live album, having nearly forgotten all about the orignal album, as it got very little play on my stereo. For some reason, from that moment on I was hooked. I guess what I'm saying is give this some time, if it doesn't appeal to you on your first listen, because this album will pay huge dividends to your ears and mind in the years to come.<br /><br />\\"Pigs on the Wing\\" is a nice little introduction, but in my book it's more or less fluff around the meat of the album which starts with \\"Dogs\\". From the opening acoustic guitar to the final \\"dragged down by the stone,\\" I can't get enough of this song anymore, and often times wish it was longer, maybe 26 minutes like echos. On the other hand, when I'm listening to the first 4 or 5 minutes, I often wonder why they didn't cut a 5 or 6 minute radio friendly friendly version of it, as well, to release as a single. A searing commentary, this song is, on, you know who you are, the Gordon Geckos of the world.<br /><br />\\"Pigs, three different ones,\\" is also a great song, but somehow pales in comparison to dogs. The only mistake they made on this album was putting \\"Dogs\\" at the beginning, because if they'd have put \\"sheep\\" first followed by \\"pigs\\", then \\"dogs,\\" a person could have enjoyed the first two songs more with \\"Dogs\\" as the inevitable finally. As it is, as good as Pigs and Sheep sound, by themselves, I'm always wanting for more when they follow Dogs. Other then the fact this may have screwed up Roger's concept, musically it would have made a lot more sense.<br /><br />But I'm splitting hairs now. Bottom line, this has evolved into my favorite Floyd album, and for a fanatical fan like myself, that's saying a lot. If you own DSOTM, WYWH and the Wall, there is no reason not to complete the set of albums which made the Floyd the rock gods they've become.
B00006AW2M|5.0|If someone today were to produce this CD, they would be hailed as gunius or the next coming.  So perhaps this isn't the best \\"Stones\\" CD of all time, but it's one of the best CDs of all time; and no, these two statements are not necessarily contradictory.<br /><br />I've played this a dozen times in the past week and it's better than anything from new Artists I've heard in years; thus, it qualifies as a timeless masterpiece in my opinion.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|For the love of god, release this already. Since pink floyd is unlikely to ever tour again, at least give us this, to fall back on.
0393327655|5.0|One of the most brilliant and important books I have read in a nearly 60-year lifetime of reading.  Harris unflinchingly asks the questions that too few are willing to confront --i.e., why would any concious human being allow him or herself and the children they raise to be so massively influenced by one or another of the principal religious belief systems that are all at their core inherently divisive, exclusionary, and -- worst of all --well proven to inspire acts of astounding violence against others of different faiths.  Why can't we all come together around such basic universal norms as the Golden Rule that should work for secular as well as faith-based believers?  In terrifying and exhaustive detail, Harris's revealing examination of Islamic texts leaves not one scintilla of doubt that for Islamic adherents peaceful co-existence with non-believers is virtually impossible to conceive.  This is not chicken-little 'the-sky-is-falling' demagoguery (as is often the case when political partisans run amok), but cooly rational, highly accessible prose at the highest level of erudition and not without plenty of entertaining wit and calm perspective.  Absolutely required reading for every thinking person.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I bought this album because of the good reviews in this website. But I found it overrated and depressing, I couldnt bear to listen to it again. I gave it away. Could not care if it landed in the garbage can. I would go for India Arie anytime rather than this one.
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|i was reminded of the first time i heard elton john's first album upon listening to james blunt's sometimes haunting, heartfelt, and imaginative cd, 'back to bedlam'. the comparison is by no means an insult. but wait, this is elton with one part sigmund freud and 2 parts bob dylan thrown in for good measure...shaken and stirred...and what an important and timely poetic cocktail this mixture yields.  if this album offers a glimpse of what is to come, it's the start of a similar career path for james blunt. no, no...i'm not predicting sunglasses, histrionic narcissism, and ever-expanding waistlines...rather, a path rich in folky, free association style, & fantastically revealing music that projects both the vulnerability of the human existential condition and the importance of compassion and love born of meaningful connections (in a world where this is increasingly harder to achieve). there is a underlying tone of melancholy to blunt's lyrics and singing voice that i greatly appreciate. it's genuine.  blunt's songs tell of pain, regret and internal conflict (and those little converstions that we have within our heads).  we feel resignation and, all at once, rage against the machine (sometimes within the same passage). this is rare stuff indeed.  in an age of techno-babble and dizzying mixes and remixes, this is just what the good doctor ordered. we all need more authenticity in our lives. as one other reviewer stated, blunt's voice may take some getting used to, but the rewards will be many to the listener who gives this a fair shake. of final note, i appreciate the continuity of the songs. they all seem to reflect the same relevant themes through different stories and circumstances. it's one of the best albums of 2005, hands down...   5 stars.

B0000942QM|5.0|I've been hearing and seeing people elsewhere bicker about this imported remaster, so I'm going to clear up the facts and variations to this album, as it is in-comparable in similarity to the second original release which some heard back in 1985. <br /> <br />This re-release is neither the re-master of the USA, German, or original UK versions that were issued under ZZT publisher. It's actually the remaster of the \\"actual\\" original album published under ZZT/Polystar, and Island Records in the first quarters of 1985 (which was issued all over Japan and Germany). As some are saying tracks like \\"Dr. Mabuse\\" and \\"Jewell\\" are sounding more off beat and with ill-reverb. The second issue album which became the commercial release held up to 10-11 tracks. With \\"Dr. Mabuse\\" separated from \\"Strength To Dream.\\" In the original release they were together, and it was titled in composite \\"Das Testament Des Mabuse.\\" So before buying, here is the actual track list of what your getting other than what's printed or clarified on the label. <br /> <br />1. 9:08 Dream Within A Dream (extended and remixed) <br />2. 5:13 The Murder Of Love <br />3. 6:23 Jewel (cut rough minus the first cut intro) <br />4. 4:43 Duel (cd remix) <br />5. 4:25 Frozen Faces <br />6. 3:50 p:Machinery (single mix, which was on all releases) <br />7. 3:27 Sorry For Laughing <br />8. 4:05 The Chase <br />9. 10:42 Das Testament Des Mabuse/Strength To Dream [\\"Dr. Mabuse\\"] <br /> <br />DVD (Region 2) 5.1: Music Videos and Discography Gallery) <br />1 Dr. Mabuse (Version 1)  <br />2 Dr. Mabuse (Version 2)  <br />3 Duel (Version 1) <br />4 Duel (Version 2) <br />5 p-machinery  <br /> <br />Does it make it less worth the buck for importing? Heck NO! I think this remaster in fact, is a treasure trove! (As this version was released in limited round.) The sound is much better and crystal than it has ever been, and it comes with goodies if you have a region free DVD player on ya!
B00081H018|3.0|I stumbled into an Alex Delaware novel long ago and was completely taken in. A long time after THAT, I discovered that there were more novels written about this same character and I quickly became a fan of Mr. Kellerman's books. I bought The Conspiracy Club hoping it was of the same standards as the Alex Delaware novels.<br /><br />I was disappointed. This book seems like a rush job, with things going on all over the place and no clear path to anything. I'm all for new characters and new novels, but I had expected this book would be as good as his previous ones...those I can't put down! This one's hard to pick up!

B0002EXH5O|5.0|Not a single word can describe how much I enjoy listening to Megadeth. I have all of their albums(except for Risk which is their worst album to date), but none of them can come close to 1990's \\"Rust In Peace\\". This is without a shadow of a doubt the band's all time best album ever. This is also the first Megadeth album to introduce guitarist Marty Friedman(who really kicks ass on here) and drummer Nick Menza. On this album you've got awesome vocals from Dave Mustaine, lightning fast riffs, and eye popping solos from him and Marty(who I mentioned earlier), great hearable bass lines from David Ellefson, and in your face drumming from Nick(who I also mentioned earlier). The opening classic \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" will have you headbanging to this speed metal classic in no time. In fact every song on here will have you banging your head and raising the horns throughout, but the BEST song on this album is none other than the classic \\"Hangar 18\\". I really like when Dave and Marty trade off a barrage of blazing guitar solos after every drum interlude on that song, and I actually learned from many reveiwers that there were 11 solos on that song. WOW, UNBELIVABLE! Please read on for my song ratings(please note that the ratings apply to the older version of this CD that I own)<br /><br />themetalbeast's song ratings:<br /><br />1.Holy Wars...The Punishment Due - Love the opening riffs. 5/5<br /><br />2.Hangar 18 - 11 f**kin solos, BEST SONG EVER - 10/5<br /><br />3.Take No Prisoners - 5/5<br /><br />4.Five Magics - 5/5<br /><br />5.Poison Was The Cure - 5/5<br /><br />6.Lucretia - 5/5<br /><br />7.Tornado Of Souls - 5/5<br /><br />8.Dawn Patrol - 5/5<br /><br />9.Rust In Peace...Polaris - Classic album closer, very intense. 5/5<br /><br />See every song on here gets a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Grade: A+ all the way.<br /><br />Well there you have it, overall an absolute must have for any fan of Megadeth, thrash/speed or metal fan in general.

0385513755|5.0|Occasionally I pick some work of \\"popular fiction\\" that I think might be fun to read; it's shock therapy for my brain, which is so crammed with science that it rattles as I walk. I'd resisted reading The Da Vinci Code since 2003, thinking that any book this popular can't be any good. Can you say SNOB? But when I saw this Special Illustrated Edition (and the incessant drumbeat of publicity and shameless media linkage to the book, like the History Channel's \\"Da Vinci Decoded\\"), I finally broke-down and read it.<br /><br />Dan Brown's book is a taut page turner. It deals with several rather controversial assertions (to say the least) about Christianity. Whether you choose to believe them or not is a personal decision. Many are taken from another controversial book published in 1982, Holy Blood, Holy Grail. As Mr. Brown's book is a work of Fiction, I just went along for the ride and disregarded all the hoopla. As a thriller, it is one of the best I've ever read. It is intelligently written, with almost no excess material. Some of Mr. Brown's plot choices puzzled me; like the strange attack of \\"the dumbs\\" afflicting his 3 allegedly brilliant protagonists late in the book when they're unable to identify a very famous scientist from rather obvious clues. Or their inability to identify the food item associated with that scientist, something any school child knows. Crucial to the plot, obvious to the reader, their sudden obtuseness was the only real fault - if it is a fault - that I could find in this otherwise exciting novel.<br /><br />What really compounded my pleasure in reading this novel were the carefully chosen illustrations, generously interspersed throughout the Special Edition. Resembling an Oxford University Illustrated History in size and layout, reading the Special Edition was like reading a really exciting textbook (How rare is that?). Every fact came alive, every clue was vivid. It was a totally immersive experience, like a turn-based video game. And when we reached The Last Supper in the novel, visually flipping back and forth from text to painting was viscerally exciting! Those mysterious visual clues Da Vinci inserted into his magnificent painting are literally seared into my memory. I had gooseflesh for three days!<br /><br />The Special Illustrated Edition of the Da Vinci Code accomplished what I intended: my brain no longer rattles as I walk. Unfortunately, the book (and the fun) had to end. If you haven't yet read it, I strongly recommend this Special Edition. Even if you have, this experience is unique, unlike any reading adventure I've ever had. You might enjoy rediscovering the mysteries that make reading the Da Vinci Code so enjoyable!<br /><br />Postscript: As for those of you who wish to censor this book; who even censor positive reviews of this book (the instantaneous negative votes for every single positive review of The Da Vinci Code here at Amazon is as creepy as anything found in Dan Brown's Book!): censorship of ideas has never worked and never will! It reflects a strange feebleness of mind and an insecure, even frightened, faith! One can enjoy this novel without subscribing to the extraneous conspiracy theories the plot is draped upon. It is merely a work of fiction, for goodness sake! Apparently, however, anyone with a viewpoint that's even nominally different must be silenced.

B0002EXH54|5.0|God, I love Megadeth. They are truly without a doubt one of the greatest metal bands to form in the 80's (I'm not talking about that worthless hair crap like Cinderella, Warrant, Stryper, Bon Jovi, Poison, etc). I even had the privilege to see them perform at Rock Fest in Cadott over the summer, and boy, they put on a real kick ass performance. Their second album entitled \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\" released in 1986 (the same year Slayer and Metallica both released Reign In Blood and Master Of Puppets respectively) is a true thrash/speed metal classic, and I love it. This is also the band's second best album as well while \\"Rust In Peace\\" being their all time best album. Every song on here a true classic in every way.  This gem truly has everything a true thrash freak can ask for: Kick ass vocals, awesome guitar riffs, lightning fast solos, wicked bass lines, and intense drumming. Dave Mustaine has very cool vocals, and there's tons of awesome jaw dropping leads and solos from him and Chris Poland. You've also got great bass from David Ellefson, and great drumming from Gar Samuelson. Here are the ratings for the songs (please note that the ratings apply to the older version of this CD).<br />themetalbeast's song ratings:<br />1. Wake Up Dead - 5/5<br />2.

0030839939|4.0|The 20th century saw the birth of quantum mechanics, and its connection with physics, chemistry and engineering to form the discipline collectively known as solid state science.  Dealing with the properties of solids at the atomic-scale, the advances in this field have made the entire Digital Age possible.  As such, the literature, both educational and scientific, in this field has grown exponentially over the past 50 years.  One of the best books in this field is Solid State Physics by Ashcroft and Mermin.  This extremely thorough book covers the field from basic crystallography and bonding models up through magnetic, optical, and superconducting properties.  The book includes lots of derivations, sample problems, and all the important equations.  Also, the book covers both experimental techniques used in solid state science, and the growing field of computer simulations, especially those using density functional theory.  All in all a great book to read for those working in or planning to work in this field.
B000002542|4.0|It took me a long time to get into the first three Journey albums, but they finally grew on me. This first one takes a little longer than the following two to get into, but still it's a solid release. There are some people who hate the poppy sound that Journey would make with Steve Perry, but can get into this completely, because it's totally light years removed from the Steve Perry fronted sachharin sweet pop group of the early to mid eighties. I like the Steve Perry phase also, but sometimes this progressive rock can be a very refreshing change. I like the songs that Greg Rollie sings from 1978 to 1980, but he does a great job as lead vocalist on the first three albums, including this EP. I've just always thought he had a really cool voice. I think most Journey fans would agree. This isn't as good as the next two albums, but it will work in a pinch. I won't say that this is killer material, but this Greg Rollie fronted lineup is pretty cool and interesting.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game takes place in the distant future. The earth has been attacked by an alien race \\"The Buggers\\" and after nearly losing the war the humans defeated the Buggers. But now they must prepare for the next battle. Children that the I.F. feel have potential to become great military leaders have a monitor placed in their neck. The I.F. (international fleet) is able to see, hear what the monitored kid sees, hears. From this initial monitoring they determine whether or not the kid will mover forward to Battle School where the future leaders of the IF will begin their training. About 17 pages in Ender is selected to go and it appears that the IF has big plans for ender. The book follows him through Battle school and after.<br /><br />The Good: The book was very good. You are constantly surprised at how hard ender is pushed by the IF in their attempt to see what he is really capable of. The concepts of the games at battle school were pretty cool.<br /><br />The bad: almost nothing. At some points you forget how young the characters are as they come off as much more mature than they actually are but you just remind yourself that they are supposed to be geniuses. Other than that nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall the book was very good and worth reading. If you are interested in giving Sci-Fi books a shot this isn't a bad place to start.
B000063DFN|5.0|If this one had more short uptempo tracks like &quot;Two Minutes To Midnight&quot; and &quot;Ace High&quot; this would probably have sold a bit more, but this is good &quot;Art&quot; metal. &quot;Rime Of The Ancient Marriner&quot; is definitely one of the best metal tracks ever, but some people might get bored that the tracks so long, and it has a lot of quiet parts in it, but if you like progressive sort of stuff, you should have no problems with it. I cut my teeth on PIECE OF MIND, and this one isn't of that quality (you might think the opposite), but this is still one of their better releases in their illustrious career. If you're the type of person that has to have forceful pounding music with no quiet parts, you might not dig this, and you might want to look elsewhere, but if you're cool, you'll probably want to pick this one up. UP THE IRONS!!!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Words cannot describe the talent that these guys have. Every song has at least a guitar solo. A few of the first songs have amazing beginings on the drums. I don't play guitar or anything but I can tell when I just drool during the solos that these guys got talent that make groups like System of A Down look like Sh**. And thats coming from a System of A Down fan. Any way on to the songs: <br /> <br />1. Beast and The Harlot: 8/10 Great guitar thru the whole song. <br /> <br />2. Burn it Down: 9/10 One of The Amazing Drum Intros by The Rev. <br /> <br />3. Blinded in Chains: 9/10 Almost the same as \\"Burn It Down\\" <br /> <br />4. Bat Country: 100/10 Just amazing, the first metal song that my dad can sit down and listen to with me, and he's 51! One of the 3 best songs on the cd. <br /> <br />5. Trashed and Scattered: 9/10 Back to #'s 2 & 3 <br /> <br />6. Seize the Day: 100/10 Yet again another song that my dad can listen to on this cd. Sounds lots like \\"November Rain\\" and \\"I won't see you tonite pt. 1\\" <br /> <br />7. Sidewinder: 10/10 AMAZING Duel acoustic guitars <br /> <br />8. The Wicked End: 9/10 Nothing Super Special about it <br /> <br />9. Strength of the World: 9/10 By far the longest song on the disc at nearly 10 minutes and it doesnt feel repetitive. <br /> <br />10. Betrayed: 10/10 All I can say is wow <br /> <br />11. M.I.A.: 10000/10 Hands down the best song on the cd. It's also got the best guitar solo on the entire disc and the drumming better than most the songs too. The Ending accoustic guitar is pretty awesome. <br /> <br />This Cd is the first cd in a long LONG LONG time that I can keep in my cd player for 3 weeks and still not skip around on it. The last groups that did that for me were Led Zepelin, Pink Floyd, and Metalica. Another plus is that every song is at least 5 minutes long and there are at least 3 that are over 7 minutes long and all of them never ever get boring. The only downside to this Amazing cd is that there are times that M. Shadows voice gets realy nasaly and sound extreamly weird.(IE: End of M.I.A.)The Guitarists are easily good enough to hang with Slash from Guns N Roses. A must for any Guns N Roses fan, musician, or any one who just likes good music.
B00005K9LK|5.0|From beginning to the end, this is one of the most hard rocking releases that Judas Priest ever put out. This is the album that pretty much introduced me to Priest even though I had heard the song &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, and really liked it. There really isn't any slow or quiet parts, so if you like short uptempo rockers, this one's for you. Of course (as this is with almost anybody) the track &quot;You Got Another Thing Coming&quot; was the first track that I remember hearing from this awesome metal offering, but this is chaulked full of heavy tunes. &quot;(Take These)Chains, &quot;Riding On The Wind&quot;, &quot;Electric Eye&quot;, &quot;Bloodstone&quot;, and &quot;Devil's Child, are my favorites from this cd. This is so much better than the preceding album POINT OF ENTRY it's not even funny. The best couple of albums before SCREAMING were SIN AFTER SIN and STAINED CLASS. The albums BRITISH STEEL, HELL BENT FOR LEATHER, and POINT OF ENTRY were disappointing imho, but SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE brought them back to respectability. They would stay on a roll with the next release DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH, but after that one, they would definitely be on a decline that they never have quite recovered from since. Downing and Tipton are just scorching throughout this album, so I don't think anyone who likes straight ahead  metal will be disappointed in the least.
6305364648|3.0|So this movie is great!  I don't care if you are Arnold S.  When Jaime Lee punches him in the face it is like...ok...this lady is pissed off...it is one of those movies that underscores that deep truth we all know.  Even if you are a secret agent, and a world body builder...you are no match for your wife!!! <br />
B000063DHL|5.0|Like another one of your reviewers, It was kind of the cool album cover that induced me to purchase this album, but I did own the Piece Of Mind album at the time. It's just got a futuristic feel to it. I think that your reviewer Mr.Sinister from a review in late December 2005, said that he thought the song &quot;The loneliness of the long-distance runner&quot; was a stupid (he didn't choose those words I think) song, but I thought especially musically it was a very top notched track, and I was a long-distance runner in track and cross-country, so I thought it was cool, but I can kind of understand where Mr.Sinister's coming from anyway. This album kind of sounds poppy instead of straight ahead metal, but it still works in my opinion. Of course &quot;Wasted Years&quot; was a good hit for them, but I like &quot;Sea of Madness&quot;, &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange land&quot;, and &quot;Deja-Vu&quot; quite a bit. I would rank SOMEWHERE IN TIME as their second best to SEVENTH SON and PIECE OF MIND which are tied for no.1 Now that Adrian Smith is back with them, why do they need a third guitarist? You don't really need three guitars do you? I think for someone who is new to Iron Maiden, this would be the perfect place to start. Then, you might give SEVENTH SON and PIECE OF MIND a whirl. Iron Maiden at their peak is just about as good as metal gets. ENJOY!!!
B000003TAR|1.0|<br />I'll start this off without any words of respect for MTV, which I hate with every fiber of my being. If it wasn't for MTV, I never would have been introduced to Nirvana. I insist on being ungrateful to the corporate machine that is MTV. I hate how MTV introduced the beautiful and heartwrenching \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" to me. I also hate how MTV introduced the revolutionary \\"Teen Spirit\\" music video to the world. I especially hate that MTV has given me hours upon hours of free programming and music videos over the past two decades. That especially bites. The reason why MTV is such corporate swine is because they sponsored, televised, and released the fabulous MTV Unplugged in New York Nirvana gig. That gig was the most awesome sight I've ever beheld, but since I hate MTV, I'm angry Nirvana agreed to do it. Oh, how conflicted I am
B000063DFQ|5.0|I started to get into Iron Maiden in the late part of 1983, when I saw the video of &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; on MTV. I went out eagerly and bought this soon after, and boy was I surprised when the songs that weren't being played on the radio, were even better than Icarus. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; gets this album going really good, then the next song &quot;Revelations&quot; blows my mind it's so good. It's definitely on my top ten of Maiden tracks. I feel the same way about &quot;The Trooper&quot; also. &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; really kicks too, and is definitely in Maiden's top twenty list. I've heard some people put down &quot;Quest For Fire&quot;, and &quot;Sun And Steel&quot;, but in my opinion, they're also top notched tracks that are far from filler. This is definitely the very peak of Iron Maiden's output, and they were just a very tight outfit at this time back in 1983. I really wish that I could have witnessed this tour, but I don't think they came to my hometown back then, or I didn't hear about it if they did. If you're a newcomer, either start with this one, or give SOMEWHERE IN TIME a try. I'm sure those two won't disappoint you in the least. UP THE IRONS!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's Nevermind is just as slick as a Backstreet Boys album. Too bad the arrangements on any given BSB song sound better and are more complex than the best Nirvana did (admit it; \\"Backstreet's Back\\" IS a better-crafted song than \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"). Everything off Nevermind is reverb'd up the ass. The glossiness of studio production is meant to ENHANCE what good there already is in a song. But with Nirvana, it does the exact opposite; the overproduction makes the repetitive lyrics and poorly-played guitar stand out even more. Plus, nobody wants to hear glossed-over guitar fuzz that Cobain pollutes his music with. Just look at \\"Breed\\"; where the lyrics just consist of: \\"I don't care if it's old/ I don't have a mind/ Get away from your home.\\" Yep. Those three lines accompanied by six repeated bass notes are whole the freakin' song. Everybody over the age of 18 has owned this album at some point in their lives. I have as well. That doesn't make it good. Nirvana is meant for beginner music listeners who haven't developed their own unique taste in music yet. When you move on from Nirvana, you realize there's so much more in the music world. Moving on from Nirvana means a rebirth of your music taste. There are COUNTLESS other bands/peformers that were popular in the 80's and 90's that created better music than Nirvana. <br /> <br />And here's small list to name a few (it includes Alt Rock, Pop, and Rap)... <br />Sublime <br />Smashing Pumpkins <br />311 <br />Live <br />Everclear <br />Goldfinger <br />Local H <br />Beck <br />REM <br />Fionna Apple <br />10,000 Maniacs  <br />The Cranberries <br />Stabbing Westward <br />The Cure <br />Depeche Mode <br />Oasis <br />Madonna <br />Seal <br />Coolio <br />Tone Loc <br />Beastie Boys <br />
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest keep up the ass kicking rock after their successful release SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE in 1982. This album has a dark feel to it, but it is still very satisfying nonetheless. The two great guitarists have some scorchingly superb guitar solos, especially in &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot;, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, &quot; Some Heads Are Gonna Roll&quot;, &quot;JawBreaker&quot;, &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot;, and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. I've heard that the track &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; has some homosexual connotations (I didn't know that Rob Halford was gay at the time), but I never really thought of it as talking about gay sex, so that takes some of the shine off of a good song. If you like hard rock or heavy metal that's happy and positive sounding, this won't be up your alley, but I think most Amazon customers will like this classic metal offering.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Think Green Day have anything worthwhile to say now they claim they're into politics? Nope. Think Green Day have matured since Dookie? Think again. They're as immature as ever, and are coming soon to a town near you to expose themselves to your 12 year old kid after a concert. After all, it's not like Billie Joe will remember after all his drug and booze binges.  <br /> <br />I can't stand these guys. They came out with a new look (the EMO uniform of wearing all black clothes with black eyeliner-- what happened to their real clothes?) but they are still the same irresponsible ass-holes we've known since the MTV blew up their Longview video. Now they come out with a power ballad like \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" (while still managing to squeeze the \\"fu*ck\\" word into the song ten times) and continue to proceed to act like the juvenile pricks we've always known them to be. On Bullet in a Bible, Billie Joe proceeds to mock-masturbate during the middle of \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\". This is not surprising if you know Billie Joe's past, and the fact that he'd expose himself to fans to, as he puts it, \\"give them something to remember, even if it's small\\" after concerts. Green Day should include the band's rap sheet on their website. Along with Billie Joe's accompanying mugshots for that and his indecent exposure and DUI arrests which are found at thesmokinggun.com/mugshots . I'd love to see mothers take their kids to Green Day shows now.  <br /> <br />\\"Why are there no clouds in the sky?\\" Billie asked at one live show. \\"Because God wants to watch his favorite band again.\\" <br /> <br />Sorry, Billie, but terrorists use that same justification to bomb people. Just because the sky is clear doesn't mean you can assault us with your sh*tty music. Lay off the cocaine. It makes you too self-assured. <br />
B00008IAMD|5.0|Of some 3000 records I own Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around is one of the most powerful and moving I have ever heard. Cash gives meaning and deapht to songs that would just pass by when done by other artists.
B00008DDSC|5.0|First and foremost - this movie is NOT for everyone. \\"Discipline\\" is not for everyone. S&M is not for everyone.  If however you are one who is interested in this, or at least curious this movie may be for you; if on the other hand, you believe that the lights have to be off to have s-e-x because you can't even say the word without spelling it - you should pass.<br /><br />What is this movie? A wonderful story about two people who need and love each other. They are both quirky, strange, and by most \\"normal\\" peoples standards weird. They are different sides of the same coin, and this movie brings them together.<br /><br />There are moments, when you'll find yourself laughing out loud at some of the parts - not because they are bad, or unintentionally funny, but because they are truly hilarious and creative.  There are other moments when you hurt for the characters in the movie, not because the spanking was \\"too hard\\" but because you can see they love each other, but are too shy to admit it (even to themselves); and because of this, nearly lose each other.<br /><br />The acting is well done, the story is tightly weaved. This is a fine addition to any collection. One might go so far as to say it's a 21st century celluloid Story of O.<br /><br />(for those just looking for T&A - yes, it has some; but it's much, much more than that)
0792164903|4.0|I love Tim Burton's work, and Sleepy Hollow is no exception. This film has fantastic effects, yet another atmospheric score by Danny Elfman, and yet another inspired turn by Johnny Depp (I actually think this is one of his finest performances - his Ichabod Crane is a funny, deft combination of fussiness and phobias, with just a dab of the effeminate.)  <br /> <br />But I'm a bit mystified at the raves Christina Ricci received for her performance. That's why I rated this 4 stars - her stilted performance took it down that notch for me. As I said, stilted is the word (IMHO). Her line readings are stiff -- she gives no emotional nuance to her dialogue, and I was reminded of an automaton. And she seems to think she can get by with just looking wide-eyed all the time. (And considering that she's naturally wide-eyed, it's probable that she barely broke any discernable facial expression throughout.) <br /> <br />I still enjoy watching this movie for it's creepy story and otherwise excellent cast. But I tend to kind of zone out when she's center stage.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I've been a big fan of the music from the stage production of Phantom of the Opera for a long time (yes, I know that makes me a Philistine to some of you), but I have never actually seen the musical.  However, on my trip home last week, I was able to catch the movie version and see a little bit of what I've been missing.  There have been lots of horror movies and other adaptations of the Phantom story, but this is the first one that is based on the musical.  It's a lavish production with a wonderful Christine (played by 16-year old Emmy Rossum) that is only let down by the two male leads.  Same music as the play for a fifth of the cost!<br /><br />Most people know the basic story, so I won't go into great detail.  Christine Daae is a novice singer at the Paris Opera House, taken in by Madame Giry when her father died.  She has been tutored in singing by someone she identifies as the \\"Angel of Music\\" who is really the Phantom, a horribly (ok, not that horribly, at least in the film) disfigured man who lives in the catacombs underneath the Opera House.  The Phantom has fallen in love with her, however, and is willing to kill in order to both win her heart and advance her career.  Mayhem ensues (but doesn't it always?), especially when the Opera House is taken over by new owners who don't quite understand the rules of the Phantom's game.  When Christine falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, the Phantom gets even crazier.<br /><br />The production values in the movie are almost breathtaking, with beautiful architecture and creepy water-filled catacombs.  The Phantom's underground lair is almost haunting with its small mock-up of the Opera House, and hidden alcove with his Christine mannequin in it.  Sweeping staircases abound, especially showcased in the \\"Masquerade\\" sequence.  The choreography is also great, especially during \\"Masquerade\\" and the final set piece, \\"Point of No Return.\\"  For those who think Joel Schumacher and then think Batman & Robin, this movie will definitely remove that horrible image.  I thought almost everything about the production was wonderful.  Ok, Christine passes the same grave markers a few times during the cemetery scene, but the rest is almost perfect.<br /><br />Which brings us to the cast.  Emmy Rossum is quite the discovery and she has a magnificent voice, able to handle all the various songs with ease. She's beautiful (and she's 16, so watch out!) and can hold her own with her castmates.  Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, isn't quite as good.  Most of the songs he handles ably, but occasionally (mostly when he tries to be intense), he almost shouts the words rather than singing them, and his performance falls off the rails.  However, his turn with Christine during the \\"Point of No Return\\" is very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Patrick Wilson, the third major cast member.  I found his Raoul vapid and Wilson was trying too hard.  I didn't like his voice that much, and I really couldn't fathom what Christine saw in him (unless it was his long hair).  I don't think he has a solo in the movie, so he's always paired off with somebody, and he never comes out on top.  During the final sequence, when Christine has to choose, both he and Butler were going a bit too far, making me wish Christine had a third choice:  let them have each other instead of her.  But oh well.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is more minor, but all of them do a fabulous job with what they are given.  I've always loved Miranda Richardson (even more so when I remember how she played Queen Elizabeth in Black Adder, and then see her in a serious role) and she is great here too.  Simon Callow and Ciarin Hinds are funny as the two new theater owners, playing just this side of over the top (ok, just *that* side, but they were still good). And Minnie Driver, though she did not sing her role (she was dubbed) is pretty good as Carlotta, too, though the accent got a bit much after a while.<br /><br />There were a few problems with this movie, besides some of the cast.  Most of them were minor, almost nitpicks, but they did bring my opinion down a little bit.  First, if the Phantom is the guy who drives Christine to the cemetery, how did he get to the crypt ahead of her?  I know she was busy singing, but I would think she would have noticed him passing her.  Second, and this may have been caused by me watching this movie and my niece's Cinderella play in quick succession, what is the deal with musical characters falling in love at the drop of a hat?  Cinderella is *really* bad for this, because at least in Phantom the two characters are childhood friends.  But they meet for the first time in many years, and within a day or two, they are soulmates?  Still, that's a problem from the play (and perhaps even the book), so I won't harp on it too much, except it seems to always happen in musicals.  Finally, the constant interruptions by Raoul in the \\"present day\\" (the movie begins in the 1920s, while the story itself takes place in the 1880s) got tiresome after a while, and really didn't move the story along.  The beginning was good, and the ending was very fitting, but there could have been a few less in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed Phantom of the Opera.  If you like the music, you could get the CD and imagine the play.  Or you can watch this movie for a fraction of the cost of the show and get to see it acted out in a pretty good way.  It's certainly worth a look.<br /><br />David Roybr />There were a few problems with this movie, besides some of the cast.

B0002858YS|3.0|I got this CD mostly just for Mr. Brightside. There are a few    pretty good songs but some like Andy You're A Star and Everything Will Be Alright ( I like to refer to it as the hangover song, listen and you'll know what I mean) are pretty bad. Most people I know HATE them so watch out. Some lyrics are a little nonsensical like Believe Me Natalie and Somebody Told Me.  There are only a couple songs you can like on here at first listen and a couple you'll probably hate and quite a few that will take time to get used to.    Recommended- No terribly foul lyrics (though some vague sexual refrences) so....11 OR 12-Up    Overall-Pretty good to listen to because of songs like Somebody Told Me and Smile Like You Mean It but this CD isn't for everyone.

0060764899|5.0|I have read this story several times in my life however i never wrote a review.  I recently read the book again because the movie was coming out and i wanted to see how well the movie tied into the book.<br /><br />This is simply a wonderful book and a very quick and easy read.  Please do not be discouraged from reading this book because of the possible Christian references.  Whether you are a believer or not you can fully enjoy this fictional tale.<br /><br />The book is full of fantasy creatures, heros and enemies that will leave you smiling at the pure genius of how it all comes together.  I have always enjoyed this book and will probably read this book a few more times over the course of my lifetime.<br /><br />Take some time and read this book before seeing the movie, you will not be disappointed.

B00066R4T8|4.0|True Story of overcoming the mind and the mountain.<br /><br />Joe, and his buddy Simon, climb a mountain, a big cold mountain. Just the two of them, out in the wicked cold conditions. Me - I'd rather be home warm and snug, thank you. But, this book is about Joe.<br /><br />They set off on their adventure with high hopes, of course. We get to feel the cold, the sore muscles, the wind, the rocks, the footholds, the ice screws, the rope, the clamp-ons... Every step is documented. I can feel the cold wind and numb fingers.<br /><br />They reach the summit, yea! Then, on the way down, there is trouble. Oh NO!!! But, I'm not going to give it away! Will Joe and Simon make it back? Will they loose toes and fingers to frostbite? Will they run out of rope, clips, food, strength?<br /><br />The book was good reading, but, I must admit, There was one point, where poor Joe was crawling, and he described every inch. And, I mean every inch. I skipped ahead 2 pages, and he was still crawling and describing every inch. (Hence, 4 stars not 5, sorry Joe!!) Aside from that tiny part, very gripping story.<br /><br />Pure endurance, the fight for life, in slow motion. So cold, and somewhat disorientated, Joe is near death a few times, but he doesn't mind. He is too darn cold and tired to care. But he persists. Will it be enough? Will they get out alive?<br /><br />In bed, reading this, last night, my dear hubby, Norman asked me, \\"So, does he make it?\\" I laughed, \\"well I think he does, sweetums, or he wouldn't have been here to write the book!\\"<br /><br />Finished it up, and got to sleep about 3:00 this morning. It was good. But, the next true adventure book I read... I think I'll read that one about the kid that gets his arm stuck between a bolder and the cave wall. Not so darn cold!!

B000AWYOGE|1.0|Dark Water showed great promise. Good actors, intriguing trailers, the credit given to the movie by misunderstood confusion with other Japanese-to-American thrillers. So where did it go wrong? After about the first hour. If you are patient enough to sit through a slow moving plot, the first hour of this story is fine. Tense moments, flashbacks, creepy environments, and anguished characters will keep you busy while you wait for the resolution, which promises to be something worth waiting for.  <br /> <br />Then comes the let down. The seemingly deep characters become shallow, plot seems to be wrapped up, but it's not, and (**SPOILER ALERT**) Jennifer Connelly's ex-husband the movie has been trying to paint as a ruthless, adultering, manipulative, arrogant thug, becomes the hero-father-figure. <br /> <br />So why exactly is the water dark? The movie never really explains, but I am guessing it's because regular water wouldn't have fooled people into thinking this movie was anything more than an ordinary plumbing problem. Another guess - because in the dark is the only place the moviemakers could lead you into believing the illogical and desperate plot presented here.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

There you will also read that he dropped out of the Berkley School of Music because he was bored and wanted to play...he'd been playing since he was a kid. As a self-taught guitarist, I know how difficult starting an instrument can be, as I'm sure a lot of people out there have discovered. I'm not here to bash those who've yet to realize the brilliance of John Mayer (Trio), nor am I some 13-year-old girl that is simply attracted to John. I'm a musician and have been since I began singing in church when I was three. I'm 23 now and have been playing the guitar for just over 3.5 years now, in part, due to the inspiration of John Mayer and Dave Matthews. Music, remember, is not something you can judge the way you can a simple fact. No one judgement will ever be 100 percent right or wrong, including my own. <br /> <br />As far as the album goes, I like it...that's really all that matters...maybe you'll like it, too...
0393327655|5.0|This is must read for humans. Though Sam's work is excellent, after I finished The End of Faith I was left feeling depressed and highly embarrassed to be human. Not sure this book will move religious believers to put down their weapons of hate and lunacy toward their fellow man but a person interested in some historical truths of monumental importance will find plenty of human atrocities to ponder with The End of Faith. It is difficult to admit that I am ashamed to be human, but this is the feeling that overwhelmed me after reading The End of Faith. If after you read The End of Faith you don't feel ashamed about the endless pain and suffering sanctioned through religion then your religion consumes and blinds your reason. If humanity does survive it will be because we decide to stop slaughtering each other not-with-standing the mandates of religion. The End of Faith is an excellent read to differentiate the religious from the non-religious -it is up to you to decide which side of faith will advance humanity.

The plot meandered as though Grisham was struggling to come up with a good story. He pulled it off in the end (because he IS a good writer), however the writing was still under par for his experience.

His mother and father are superheroes who save the Earth from complete obliteration on a daily basis before dashing home to their \\"normal\\" jobs (real estate sales). Will's first day of school will be at Sky High, his father's alma-mater, a place where the offspring of other superheroes congregate and learn how to harness their powers. Trouble is, though, Will's powers haven't materialized (kind of like a set of wisdom teeth that haven't come in yet).<br /><br />His neighbor and lifelong friend, Layla, tells him not to worry about it, it'll happen. Easy for her to say, she can make trees grow and manipulate nature. Will hides his lack of powers from his parents and his new schoolmates. But not for long. On the freshman's first day, Coach Boomer (a gym teacher played by Bruce Campbell, BUBBA HO-TEP) is assigned to decide who becomes a superhero and who's a simple sidekick. And when Will can't do anything, he is flung into the dregs of the sidekicks. But he finds friends there, simple guys and gals who have limited powers. Some can only glow or turn into a puddle of goo, but they're all nice. And they cling to Will because of who his mother and father are (the two strongest superheroes of all time).<br /><br />Will's willingness to stick with his true friends will be tested as other forces and higher classmen shmooze for his attention<br /><br />And what's a superhero without a super-villain. Enter an old villain that Will's dad defeated years ago and put him/her in Will's school and you've added a new layer to a freshman's problems.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />SKY HIGH is fun, cheeky, and clean family film viewing.

1591396190|4.0|I like this book though I'm always bothered by marketing books that claim to make everything else obsolete. There's lots of good stuff here but there's still not much that will beat good research, quality implementation, and fantastic customer service.<br /><br />That being said, though, what company couldn't use a little creative kick? The book will help you look at all aspects of your business from different view points and help you find areas where you can grow and improve irrespective of competition.<br /><br />I see this as a kind of big business book - though it can be useful for anyone thinking about business. I'm not sure that this book will appeal as much to service oriented businesses. For one thing there will always be competition. For another, focus has to be on the customer, not the product. But there are still ways to differentiate yourself from competitors and this book can kick start many good ideas in that direction.<br /><br />Helpful and thoughtful but might be hard to implement for smaller companies.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Lars von Trier's recent masterpiece is probably one of the most important films in recents years about the tragedy of human nature.  The whole film is on a set with props, but after the first few scenes, you soon lose sight of this because the plot is so intriguing.  Yes, the film is long.  Yes, it is slow.  But more than anything, Dogville is an important commentary of the reflection of the human ego.  The cast is amazing and the technical angle of the film is flawless.  I can't see everyone liking this film, especially the casual movie-goer. But if you don't mind slower-paced films with an intense socialogical message, this is a must.

B00005JOHI|3.0|Elizabeth Bennett (Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (MacFadyen) do not impress each other in their first meeting.  In fact, they seem alltogether unimpressed with each other.  Circumstances continually force their paths to cross, and soon their opinions of each other begin to change.  Things are not happily ever after though, as marriage proposals interfere with their possible relationship, but if you know the story, you know how it ends.<br /><br />Yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", and I am told that this is a pretty good one.  The story, however, did not hold my interest.  I am not a Jane Austen fan, and was probably doomed from the start to be disappointed.  Keira Knightley does a good job as Lizzie though, being both playful and vulnerable.  MacFayden, as Mr. Darcy, is uninspiring, but Darcy himself is kind of a jerk at times and I found him unlikeable.  This is a movie I would recommend for Jane Austen fans only.  I think they will enjoy the film, but others will not.
B000BGH22W|2.0|In 2005, fans of Harry Potter feared for the quality of the musical interpretation of their beloved series when it was announced that John Williams, who scored the first three magical adventures, passed the baton on to another composer, Patrick Doyle, due to a bursting scoring schedule. <br /> <br />The big question was: would Doyle continue the style of Williams or would he do something completely new? He chose the latter, and the result is a below average score. And the worst thing is, it's not only average within the Potter universe, it doesn't even hold up when you compare it to this year's scores in general. <br />Writing about the music itself would be redundant, since already the entire concept behind the score is as wrong as it can possibly get. <br />As absurd as it may sound, I dislike Goblet Of Fire because Doyle made the score his own. When a composer enters a movie series with that kind of legacy, he has to have the personal greatness to compromise some of his personal style in order to continue the series properly. What Goblet Of Fire needed was a Harry Potter score with a touch of Doyle, not a Doyle score with a touch of Harry Potter. As a composer, when you enter a franchise, you have to honour the past and build a bridge to the future, not write something completely different in tone. Doyle inherited the best possible fundament from Williams to build upon. And completely neglecting Williams' themes, except for two or three statements of Hedwig's Theme, is in my opinion a pretty poor way to pay tribute to this glorious past. And I can't spot anything in Goblet Of Fire that future composers could work on either; Doyle went all the way. Instead of getting just a little darker and more balanced, he tried his best to become as sinister as possible. There's no room for any more developments when film 5 or 6 show us some of the darkest moments in the series. <br />I constantly read reviews and comments that praise Doyle for not paying too much attention tothe magical aspects of the story. Why should that be good in a film about a Triwizard Tournament? Williams also wrote a much darker and emotional score without losing the Potter sound: \\"Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" had magic with style, combined with emotion and bombast. Leave any of these out and you end up with a dull, dull score, that's Goblet Of Fire; no magic, but ridiculously loud bombast. <br /> <br />Then I hear people defending the lack of old themes by saying that \\"Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" omitted several main themes as well. Yes, that's true, but people, please consider the circumstances! <br />Voldemort isn't there, so consequently his themes aren't there. We don't get to Diagon Alley, so this one's missing as well, Plus, the Quidditch match is about the Dementors, so the Quidditch/ Flying music wouldn't make sense there. The film doesn't feature the traditional \\"End of the year feast in the Great Hall\\", so there can't be something like \\"Reunion Of Friends\\" as well. Williams knew he had to compensate this thematic void. You see, for \\"Azkaban\\", Williams HAD to leave out several main themes, so he wrote some new POTTERish themes. Doyle on the contrary CHOSE to leave out 90 % of established material and replaced it with GENERIC stuff. <br /> <br />I must appear like a little Williams geek, but that's just what I think. Nobody can, and should, reinvent the wheel, but, most unfortunately for other composers, that's exactly what Williams is doing. He just continues to invent wheels, writing perfect scores, and there's absolutely nothing that could be improved. Williams nailed Harry Potter in film 3, so every composer after that has only two choices: either he follows Williams' rules or he fails. Doyle can come in and shove Harry Potter full of conservative, not to say bland, orchestrations, Elfman could say \\"I want to go this way\\", even Goldsmith could resurrect and write his best ever, it would not work; Williams nailed it, he IS the direction! <br />Look at other movieseries he's worked on (Jurassic Park, Jaws); the composers that followed him either picked up his work (Jurassic Park 3) or failed (Jaws 3). <br /> <br />Then I always hear that Harry Potter 4 shows us a new world and this justifies Doyle's detour. New world? Where? What's new? We're in Hogwarts, all the characters are there. It's dark, but so is \\"Azkaban\\". It's emotionally powerful, but so is \\"Azkaban\\" (even more so in my opinion). <br /> <br />Williams summed up the entire atmosphere of film 3 in the first two minutes of \\"Secrets Of The Castle\\"; Doyle fills an entire album and never nails it. <br /> <br />The most horrid thing about this score is that even if Doyle's approach was right, the execution is so bland and amateurish that it hurts.  <br />Sometimes I hear Batman, sometimes Star Wars, Lord of te Rings and even Die Another Day, but I don't hear Harry Potter. Patrick Doyle's music, especially the orchestrations are so bland! Someone needs to tell him that there are other ways to highlight a beat than hammering bass drums and cymbal crashes. These become sometimes so overbearing that it irritates you. And the dynamics! I haven't heard a single score that has less sense for dynamics and tension; there's no dynamic range to speak of whatsoever. Listen to \\"Golden Egg\\" and yawn! <br />This score seriously lacks, in a word, skill. Not one dissonance even trying to be unsafe even when it's appropriate, not one resolution not utterly predictable. <br />The themes are equally bleak; Hogwarts Hymn is nice, but doesn't go anywhere and the \\"Harry In Winter\\" theme sounds like it was looped over and over. Doyle's Voldemort theme is actually a version of Williams' motif, but Doyle managed to make even that theme sound dull. <br />I hate to say this, but this score sometimes even sounds pathetic, in \\"Rita Skeeter\\" for example, where Doyle sounds like he desperately tried to mimic Williams' comedy scoring. <br /> <br />The music is even worse when you watch the actual movie with it because tha makes you realise what opportunities Doyle missed. I do like the sound of \\"Death Of Cedric\\" and \\"Hogwarts Hymn\\", but \\"Hogwarts' March\\" is the most despicable piece of film music I've ever heard. Even if it's source music in the film, what has a Bierfest Polka to do with the Scottish flavour of the film? This is a perfect example for what I'm talking about: Williams wrote the majestic \\"Hogwarts Forever!\\" for these occasions, what's the point in throwing it right out of the window just because of one's selfishness? <br /> <br />I'm just praying that the producer comes to his senses and hires Williams on time for \\"Order Of The Phoenix\\". <br />There are also many people out there, mainly die-hard Potter fans, who think that John Williams couldn't come up with a fresh approach for another Potter film. You seriously underestimate him. Coming up with new sounds for a series was always one of his easiest exercises, look at Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Star Wars. There is no indication anywhere in his three Potter scores that he might fail at future films. The two scores he wrote full time, Philosopher's Stone and Prisoner Of Azkaban, are vastly different. <br /> <br />The crowning achievement that makes this Potter film a musical failure all around is the inclusion of three pop songs performed by some singing epileptic called Jarvis Cocker. The Harry Potter series, once a prime example for a blockbuster franchise that maintains musical integrity and artistry, has now also given in to the disgusting trend of hiring some noisy singers for a couple of bad songs that have neither connections to the film, nor any purpose at all, except for pushing the sales numbers. <br /> <br />My opinion is that even a John Williams ripoff would have been far more satisfying than this tripe. <br />Like I said, this should have been a Potter score with a touch of Doyle, not a Doyle score with a touch of Potter, but unfortunately, Patrick Doyle failed on all fronts imaginable, except one: he gave Hedwig's Theme a nice new spin, but that's hardly a saving grace.

055380457X|3.0|We all know how Google get started. How Larry Page is originally working on his PhD thesis on search, and later with Sergey Brin, his stanford mate, founded Google. They, like many technology founders, didn't initially realize what a huge commercial opportunity they have in hand. They attempted to create a better, smarter search engine as an academic interest, a technical challenge instead as a commercial endeavor. Similar to the startings of Yahoo. Only in recent years, (and a huge thanks to Overture), did they find a reliable and extremely profitable revenue model through ads.    But most of the information and stories presented in the book are widely and openly available through a countless series of articles on Google. The author failed to present us with a fresh perspective or a more insider scope about the company.  The PageRank algorithm is awesome and played a huge role in the initial success of Google. But we need more insight into the creation and evolution of the ranking algorithms. It is certainly much more than finding the most popular links and displaying it first.    Eric Schmidt, the CEO shares his power with Larry and Sergey. It is by no means an easy task and I doubt this division of power could last. We need more management stories about power struggles, the dilemma faced by the CEO and the worries about the founders being able to veto the decision made by the CEO.    Google's computing infrastructure is one of the best in the world. With hundereds of thousands of servers, the processing power is really unbelievable and the kind of computer science problems that it could potentially solve is endless. Watch out 512-bit encryption, you could be cracked ;) I am hoping the author could give us more details and insights about the current computing infrastructure, how they come into being, the complications and how they might evolve to better serve the future.    I find the 'Don't be evil' mantra kinda funny. It's like 'Dont eat meat'. We all know it isa good thing, sounds like a religious mission, but don't give us much to go on. If a person has to be reminded to not do evil things everyday, what does that tell us about the person?    All in all, it is a decent book. For those fascinated by Google and don't follow industry news that much, it could be an interesting read. But don't hope for juicy untold stories not found elsewhere, or insider stories about internal workings or disgruntled ex-employees complaining about the problems of Google. You will be left disappointed.

0887307280|1.0|After reading this book, I was motivated to go out and purchase a franchise in a business that was not one I was familiar with, much as the author described.<br /><br />About $350,000 later, I abandoned the business and returned to my original field.  I was a failure.  Why?<br /><br />The author encourages you not to \\"bake pies\\" because you enjoy pie baking.  What I found was that I left a field where I had contacts, peers, support groups and familiar resources. Instead, I entered a world foreign to me where I was trying to establish business relationships as a newcomer in an environment of long-standing business relationships.  And, I hated the business.  Try being successful doing that.<br /><br />For some people, this formula works, but I urge caution.  I instead learned to follow the advice of Donald Trump, that if you do something just for the money or the balance sheet, you'll never really be a success. Do what you love, and you'll be successful.  This book encourages you to do the opposite.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL.  This cost me my life savings and I would exercise caution in following this advice.

I immediately expected, when i heard of the film that when i watched it i would be in for another \\"Jim carrey\\" comedy act but infact, this is probably one of the best roles i have seen him in, i had never seen him in a serious role before this but he proved himself to be the brilliant actor i have always though him to be and managed to maintain the role brilliantly, as did Kate Winslet in her role as clementine.  <br />As i was confused for most of this film, i wasnt sure what to expect at the ending, but it definately caught me saying \\"ooohh right\\" when i finally put all the pieces of the film into place. And with most romantic films, an emotional ending, but definately different from any \\"romantic comedy\\" i have ever seen. This film included much more of a darker side to it, and it worked!

B000244FDW|4.0|I have a soft spot for this version. I first saw it when it was on Masterpiece Theater with my dad (who died last year) and the rest of my family.    Garvie is the best Elizabeth I've seen, while she didn't have the verve Ehle's Elizabeth has, I feel she is truer to the character of the novel.  Austen's Elizabeth had wit and vivacity, but I don't picture her as forward as Ehle's Elizabeth, who is a modern Lizzy.     I would have loved to see Garvie opposite Firth (of course, she was too old for the role in 1995, so it is just fantasy casting), who I liked as Darcy better.     Firth was able to portray the changes in Darcy which Elizabeth's angry rejection brings about better.  I didn't think Rintoul managed to convey this well.    I liked Mrs. Bennet, she was more restrained than the 1995 version, less cartoonish.     Jane was far superior in this version too.    However, the 1995 version is still my favorite and NOT because of Firth.    I think the 1995 version stuck closer to the novel than this one did.    A few examples:     The scene where Elizabeth gets the letter from Jane alerting her to Lydia's elopement. In the book and the 1995 version,Darcy walks in on her right after she learns the news.     In this version Elizabeth runs to Pemberly (miles) looking for her Aunt and Uncle and dashes in to Darcy's sitting room with barely a knock.    Darcy walking in on her is important, it doesn't make sense she would share her troubles with him if he hadn't caught her unawares.    Especially considering her mortification over her family AND that Wickham was involved. (This bugs me in the 2005 movie too, in that version Darcy is sitting with the Gardners, which again, makes no sense. Why would she tell him once she found her Aunt and Uncle?)     The conversation with Lady Catherine is cut down in this version. Elizabeth's anger is much more muted here than in either the book and the 1995 version.    The second proposal scene. In the book and the 1995 version Elizabeth,Darcy and Kitty go walking with Jane and Bingley. Kitty runs off to see Maria Lucus, then Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia's marriage.    In this version, Darcy sends a note to Elizabeth to meet him in the grove, which she does. This eliminates her fears over Darcy's feelings for her, she is more sure of herself because he has made the first move (by asking her to meet him). In the book and 1995 version, she breaks the ice by thanking him, and later in the book teases him that she made the first move in assuring their happiness. He denies this by saying he was about to bring up Lady Catherine's visit but she beat him to the punch (not in those words of course, LOL).    There is no final scene between Mr. Benett and Elizabeth where he asks for her assurance that she really loves Darcy. It is a touching scene in the book which illustrates the father/daughter bond.    This is not to say this version isn't very good, it is. I love this story and don't think there can be too many versions, if done well.    I am looking forward to a version where they dramatize the end of the book better, the story doesn't end after second proposal. I would love to see The Collins family come running back to escape Lady Catherine's wrath at the news and his subsequent behavior towards Darcy.    In conclusion, while the 1995 version remains my favorite, this one is extremely well done and worth the time
B0007M22TI|5.0|With all the accusations of the dubbed performance it was still performed live to the best of the production teams ability along with Celtic Woman. They are still taking their live perfomances and bringing them into the concert! Why they did not just do a whole big live show is stupid because then you have people who think your the biggest cheat. These women are most certainly talented and they are doing their concert tour for the US in March. I believe they are the real deal and hearing from people who saw them in concert they can sing.     These women all have been around musical arts their whole lifes and are in musical families they have been raised and brought up with god given talents. No doubt that they have pipes. So stop saying these ladies cant sing one bit.    There was Im sure songs recorded in a studio but these women can still sing.  It's not like somone else is singing for them it is their vocals so stop the nagging and expect that not all dvd concert's are edit free. This showccases them so people will go see for them selfs in person.    And also these artist have made many accomplishments and awards in solo careers along with touring with other famouse Irish groups. You cant deny they aren't talented and Im sure they are giving us the real deal with their tour. They need to back themselves up because these things will come up.     As for a reviewer on here who emailed whoever about the dvd. He has no proof of it, not that Im saying it isn't likely.    The producers had quality in mind and gave exactly that to us.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First Impressions of Earth is so good. I nearly made in my pants the first time I listened to it, it's that good. It's progressive but it's still The Strokes, I don't understand how a fan of theirs wouldn't like it. You know what you're getting when you buy one of their albums. If you're a fan of The Strokes get it, even if you're not, get it, just get it and nearly defecate in your trousers, as I do each time I listen to it. So good.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This is the only Sufjan Stevens album I've ever heard so this review is strictly a reflection of this recording. <br /> <br />Take Death Cab for Cutie, add a pinch of Flaming lips (from the last 6 years), then a dash of Philip Glass performed by your nearest high school orchestra, mix in some female back up singers and give everyone lots of prozac on a quiet, sunny midwest morning. There you have it. This album isn't for everyone but if you like any of the above mentioned artists, this CD is worth spending money on. Sufjan shines with creative promise and I can't help but think later efforts will be more cohesive and better produced. I can't wait. Have to knock off one star for the album being a bit on the sleepy side. I certainly agree with the album of the year votes....at least top five.
B00000K0DK|5.0|The power of this film owes much to its deft handling of archetypes.  The young Charles Foster Kane loses his private, personal \\"Eden\\" (or the innocence of his youth and family connections).  His response is chronic overcompensation, which leads to meaningless material acquisition (Xanadu, newspaper empire, statues that never come out of their crates, trophy wives, etc.).  Kane's striving after power, control, and \\"things\\" (the fruits of capitalist society) stems from the trauma of failing to find meaningful connections, purpose, and love in his youth.  The film makes a powerful connection between the corruption of society and the corruption of human nature.  This states, somewhat simplistically, what I take to be the core theme of this masterpiece.  Of course, the greatness of the film is in its complex elaboration of this theme, through a brilliant use of the entire arsenal of cinematic expressive devices.  A towering achievement. <br />
B0002IVN9W|2.0|I typically like the over-hyped indie bands and am a big fan of many bands that seem to be lumped in with Arcade Fire, but I just don't get this band. I've tried. Over and over. And it keeps pissing me off, because even when I don't like a band I can at least see why other people like them. This band has nothing. The singers voice is so irritating it renders it unlistenable. There is no song structure and no discernible song writing ability. I want to see what you see, but alas The Arcade Fire just don't cut it. If you are reminded of Brian Eno, Talking Heads, David Bowie then go to the source. Forget it, it doesn't matter anyway.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Let's face it, he's the master of opening titles.  The opening to this score will not disappoint!  I love how it starts like a fairy tale then changes into a monotonous, gray tune that at the same time is still really pretty. <br /> <br />The harpsichord rules this album for the most part, the majority of the music being awesome Baroque/Victorian/Gothic scores...they're simply astounding.  Bits of 20's style jazz is sprinkled throughout.  It's cool and relaxed and so much fun! <br /> <br />A few highlights (besides the Main Titles): <br />Victor's Piano Solo- a calming, Beethoven-esque piano piece with a, erm, rather abrupt ending. <br />Moon Dance- comparable to Ice Dance from Edward Scissorhands, but has more of an ethereal beauty to it. <br />Piano Duet- Just listen to it.   <br />New Arrival- I think it's about 30 or 40 seconds long, but it's this amazing blast of jazz! <br />Finale- beautiful...Danny Elfman rocks the finales all the time, too. <br />End Credits Part 1- Lovely.  Amazing cello and piano stuff here.   <br /> <br />Then there are four additional jazz songs by \\"Bonejangles and His Bone Boys\\".  You won't regret buying this! <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Due to the breathtaking cinematography, heart-wrenchingly exquisite script, and flawless acting of Brokeback Mountain, this film has inevitably joined the ranks of my top ten movies. Brokeback Mountain is so much more than the \\"gay cowboy movie\\" numerous sources have labeled it as - it is a tragic love story which, in my opinion, rivals such classics as Romeo and Juliet. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed the chemistry between two lovers better than most actor/actress pairings I've seen. The intense emotion evoked from this movie continued to engulf me days after seeing it...I only hope that Brokeback continues to move viewers in the way that is has moved me.
B000BP86OG|4.0|The Darkness are one of those bands that have to be taken with a grain of salt. On the one hand, there music is a great revival of the rock and roll of the 70's and 80's: Killer guitar riffs, Soaring vocals, blazing solos, and raunchy, wacky lyrics, but that brings me to the other side of this melted coin: the lyrics are silly to say the least. Just the titles tell you exactly what your in for lyrically: \\"Knockers\\": \\"...And I love what you've done with your hair...\\" \\"Bald\\": \\"Bald, well thank god it's him instead of me.\\" \\"Hazel Eyes\\": \\"I had never seen a set of eyes more hazelerer\\" No, that is not a typo, he really used the word \\"hazelerer.\\" Sad. And of course the title track, \\"One Way Ticket To Hell ...And Back\\" is blatantly mistaken, but the band knows that. These things with turn off the rock snobs, but as I type this review I am listening to the album, and despite the horendous lyrics, I just have to say this is a great album. I hear influences of ZZ Top, KISS, Guns N Roses, Bon Jovi, Queen, Def Lepard, and the Cure. Rock on guys!
1400032717|5.0|Don't read this book if you are simply looking for another great American murder mystery.  Don't read it if you want poetic prose.  Do read it if you would like to begin to see the world from the autistic view.  The book is written as if the autistic boy had recordd the scenes.  Whatever limitations it may have in comparison to the typical best-selling novel, it more than succeeds in being a unique book, one that is rich in terms of letting the reader see the world from a different perspective.
B000B8I8X2|3.0|Roadrunner as a label is above most other labels with bands like Fear factory (dino is a god). The first track (Dagger?) is the best one with Howard's singing and the almighty Jeff Waters gracing us with his solo! (Btw, check out Annihilator if you haven't already) The rest of the cd is filled with hits and misses sometimes in the same song. And Matthew Heafy as a team captain?! Come on, how much knowledge can this dude bring to the table being 19 yrs old? Trivium is a mediocre band at best.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Stay the same or change?  After a somewhat repetitive, albeit still very listenable second album, the Strokes have decided to stretch out on their third.  The sound is thicker and Casablancas voice is front and center.  Both of which, to my ears, are good things.  But make no mistake Impressions is still clearly a Strokes record-tight jabbing guitar lines, bounding bass work, crisp drumming.  It is less ragged and frenzied than their debut and has a more studied approach.  And immediate stand-out tracks are harder to find.  Dare I say these snot-nosed punks of privelege are maturing?  At least musically they are.  Impressions is far from stellar and still has a tough time keeping up with their debut, but it is certainly a strong step towards the record that may finally prove these guys to be worthy of the hype that has so lavishly and carelessly been bestowed upon them.   If you're the type of music listener who only craves more of the same, looking elsewhere may be a safer bet.  However if you're not afraid to see your rock groups try to grow, then Impressions just may please you.
B00030590I|5.0|I cannot say I have ever been more amazed at visual style of a movie director more than when I first saw Hero on the big screen. Its got colors, atmoshphere, style, story. It has SOMETHING that makes you watch it with your jaw dropped. Beautiful.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|After years in the Spanish-speaking market Shakira emerged in 2001 with her infectious single Whenever, Wherever which she followed up with her phenomenally successfull album Laundry Service. Shakira had an unique formula: great voice, sexually suggestive dance moves, a successfull recording career in another language and she was a blonde latino girl. This formula helped her sell 13 million copies of Laundry Service and become one of the breakthrough acts of 2001.<br /><br />Then in 2005, she returned with two albums: Fijacion Oral vol.1 and Oral Fixation vol.2. Effectively this release of two different albums by her in one year garnered her acclaim and force-fed hungry fans with new music. I don't own Fijacion Oral but I own Oral Fixation. Compared to Laundry Service, this album is more mature, far more, and contains no Spanish lyrics.<br /><br />I first thought that Shakira had lost some of her 2001 magic, when I listened to this album but after further observation I realised she had just matured, hugely. She has swapped her looks for her honest lyrics and superb voice.<br /><br />I really like the first single Don't Bother, but there are some other gems on here as well such as: Timor, How Do You Do, Costume Makes The Clown and Animal City.<br /><br />Shakira seems to have invoked her spiritual side on this album, the first murmurs on this album are a part of The Lord's Prayer.<br /><br />Shakira is more of a true woman than her previous manufactured latino sex-symbol self. She even dismisses her previous self on Costume Makes The Clow with this lyric: \\"Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts, well I don't.\\"<br /><br />Oral Fixation vol.2 features guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Gustavo Cerati, but this really is Shakira's album.<br /><br />She is trying to come to terms with who she is and learning to love herself.<br /><br />2005 was a great year for music and a highlight of that was this album's release. Oral Fixation will sound 'fresh' even twenty years from now. At just over 42 minutes I would have liked to hear just a little bit more of Shakira, maybe 55:30.<br /><br />That way I would get more to satisfy me until her next album rolls around.<br /><br />Overall, Shakira's latest album is more of an interview with the woman than anything else, she lays everything down on the table from her goal setting to her annoyance at the situation in East Timor. She reveals things we never thought she would, Shakira in a new light. I hope the haters of Shakira stop the moaning about her so-called 'horrible' voice, heck her voice is amazing, isn't originality what it's all about?ty years from now.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|I would have never called myself a John Mayer fan if it wasn't for his guitar-playing during his live shows.  Having said that, it is evident from his soloing even in his early years that this was a direction he eagerly wanted to take.  You'll definitely hear a SRV and Hendrix influence, but you'll also hear a \\"normal\\" John Mayer influence on this cd.  Good song variety, good listening, and really good guitar work.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Who can not be entranced by the heavy breathing of a sexy sounding Frenchwoman, the beats of the music resembling the rhthym of exquisite lovemaking, and the chanting of the monks, reminding one that all this lascivious pleasure is sinful? This music would seem to transport one back to a time when carnal desires were a NO NO, and yet, they were ultimately irresistible to humans. When one listens to this music, their primal instincts are always inevitably unleashed. <br />  This music, however, isn't only concerned with lust. It is also explores the meaning of love. Lust leads to love and sensuality, which then leads people to devote themselves to life. This CD will inspire you to lead life to the brim, perhaps even causing the cup to overflow. And what's wrong with that?
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This composition from Nobuo Uematsu TOTALLY blew me away first when i heard it on the japanese site and again in the movie. so beautiful... <br /> <br />The Promised land. (Latin) <br /> <br />Cur in gremio haeremus? <br />Cur poenam cordi parvo damus? <br />Stella nobis non concessit, non concessit <br />Stella nobis non concessit, non concessit <br />Venarum pulsus in terram fluens <br />Parvus, parvus pulsus <br />Cor mortem ducens <br />Vita mollis in stellam redeunt <br />Animam sacrificare necesse est? <br />Cur in gremio haeremus? <br />Cur veniam petimus <br />In terram fatali?
B00005JO1P|5.0|This is one of the best biopics that I have ever watched.  This, like Jamie Fox's portrayal of Ray Charles in 2004's \\"Ray\\" is an outstanding film.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are brilliant and convincing in their roles as Johnny Cash, colorful folk writer and his wife, June Carter Cash.<br /><br />Viewers are pulled in immediately.  The first scene was of a 1968 performance at the infamous Folsom Prison, made even more so by Johnny Cash's song of that title.<br /><br />The filmed story of Cash's life begins in the 1940s with young Johnny Cash and his brother, an aspiring \\"Preacher Man.\\"  Johnny demonstrates a flair for music at an early age and his brother a talent for quoting Scripture.  Sadly, Johnny's brother dies in an accident and Johnny copes by joining the Army and writing folk songs.<br /><br />I loved the way the history of the songs was included, such as \\"Folsom Prison.\\"  Cash was married prior to marrying June Carter Cash.  The first marriage ended after 3 daughters and different lifestyles.<br /><br />June Carter Cash, famous for telling her soulmate, \\"I'll Meet You Halfway\\" came from a long line of folk singers and performers.  Her family rallied around Johnny Cash and helped him kick the dope habit.  I just loved it when her dad chased a dealer off, sending the man scurrying away in his 1964 Ford Ranchero.<br /><br />The song selection is excellent and the cast did a stellar job of portraying Cash & Carter.  All in all, a solid performance.
B00005B36H|5.0|I purchased this album maybe three years back, after hearing aenima and falling in love with tools unique style. At first i disliked this album, infact i think i almost dispised it. however, after an intensive listen to this album a couple of months down the track this album hooked me in.  <br /> <br />From a musicians standpoint this album causes nightmares. some have discredited jones' guitar playing but to manipulate the music the way he does and to compliment careys drumming is almost guiniess. the contrast in dynamics is what really sets this album apart from the other tool releases. It really is a frightening record, sit down with some good quality headphones and listen, it will blow you away. <br /> <br />this album is hard to get into, but once you enter it, there is no getting out. maybe not for the occasional music listener or for the headbanger, but any musician with a zest for the obscure must own this album
B000002I25|5.0|Yeah,we all know this is a masterpiece,blah blahblah..... <br />What I want to know is if the current pressings are digitally remastered?? I know that the entire Doors back catalog was released as such a few years ago, are they the same masters used for the current re-issues???
1563890119|4.0|For my intial taste of Sandman, I think this one is probably my favorite of the first three that I bought and read over one night. I blame it solely on the chapter \\"24 Hours\\"(which is an extraneous chapter in the overall tale if you think about it) but I'll allow myself to attribute it, as well, to the overall haunting theme of life, death, and the in-between that is sleep. Some pretty good storytelling, and some interesting(and fear-inducing) art make this a worthy bundle of linear stories.<br /><br />But if you want an insight into the absolute vision Gaiman had, you should read the scripts in the back of the collection.
B000005RFQ|5.0|With \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (1980) and its follow-up \\"Mob Rules,\\" (1981) the mighty Black Sabbath accomplished the impossible by proving that there was life after Ozzy. After going into commercial and critical decline in the late 70s, vocalist Ronnie James Dio brought the band back to its former glory, revitalizing the band and adding a new chapter to the legendary band's career.  But alas, the newly energized second incarnation was not meant to last. In '82 Dio and Sabbath drummer Vinnie Appice (who played on \\"Mob Rules\\") left the band after a dispute on the mixing and mastering of \\"Live Evil\\" (1982). After the split Ronnie James Dio and Appice formed the highly successful Dio, while founding Sabbath members' Tony Iommi (guitar) and Geezer Bulter(bass) were left with the task of rebuilding Sabbath once again.<br /><br />To fill the shoes of Ozzy and Dio, vocalist Ian Gillian made perfect sense and seemed like an ideal match. With such albums as \\"Fireball\\" (1970) and \\"Machine Head\\" (1972) under his belt, the (then) former Deep Purple frontman certainly had the background and credentials to front Sabbath. Although Sabbath and Deep Purple were rivals in their coinciding heyday, their similarities outnumbered their differences as they were both responsible for some of the decade's best rock. With Gillian at the helm and original drummer Bill Ward back behind the kit, Sabbath released their eleventh studio album, the aptly titled \\"Born Again\\" in the summer of '83.<br /><br />The third incarnation of Sabbath is not a radical departure from the sound of the Ozzy or Dio years. With Tony Iommi's heavy, gloomy riffs and bluesy solos over Ward and Butler's  solid rhythm section, \\"Born Again\\" certainly sounds like a Black Sabbath album. Gillian, however, definitely adds his signature to the band. While Ozzy and Dio certainly have different styles, both singers have a straight-forward delivery and their lyrics deal with similar themes; God, the occult, afterlife, etc. Gillian's satanic screams and more down-to-earth lyrics concerning hangovers (\\"trashed\\") and misogyny (\\"Digital Bitch\\") offered a change of pace to the band. Guest Keyboardist Geoff Nicolas peppers the album with synthesizers, giving an 80s touch to the sound of the album. While Nicolas had been present since \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" with \\"Born Again,\\" his presence is more apparent.<br /><br />\\"Born Again,\\" opens strong with the thundering \\"Trashed,\\" which sounds like a cross between \\"Neon Knights\\" and \\"Paranoid.\\" The bizarre, eerie instrumental \\"Stonehenge,\\" acts as a buffer to the sinister, off-beat, mid-tempo \\"Disturbing the Priest.\\" Butler's pounding bass over Nicolas dark synthesizers works well here. With its obvious religious theme, \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" is probably the most typical Sabbath-like song on the album.  \\"The Dark,\\" another off-beat eerie instrumental acts as the perfect lead-in to the highly, highly underrated Sabbath classic \\"Zero the Hero,\\" which has the same riff as Guns N' Roses \\"Paradise City.\\" The almost-anthem-like \\"Digital Bitch\\" is no less catchy, with its infectious hook and sing-along-chorus. The album slows down considerably for the epic title track \\"Born Again,\\" which is dark and harrowing and shows Tony Iommi at his bluesy best. \\"Hot Line\\" sounds a bit like Deep Purple's \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" and while not the album's strongest cut, is still pretty good. The melodic, hard-rocking \\"Keep it Warm\\" is effective and makes for a good closer.<br /><br />While \\"Born Again\\" fared better than Sabbath's later-day Ozzy albums, it still underperformed, failing to go gold as its immediate predecessor \\"Mob Rules\\" had. The Gillian line-up of Sabbath proved to be short-lived as the band broke-up shortly thereafter, reforming a few years later with an entirely different lineup, featuring Deep Purple's Glen Hughes and later Tony Martin. After his tenure with Sabbath, Gillian would once again front Deep Purple, starting with their \\"Perfect Strangers\\" (1984) reunion album.<br /><br />Upon its release, one of the major criticisms of the album was its mix. Ian Gillian himself says that he \\"puked\\" when he first heard the album. The 1996 edition, however, is a big improvement over the original release, and the sound has been cleared up considerably. And while most critics have panned \\"Born Again\\" since its release, over time it has attained a cult following. This is one album that I feel most critics are really wrong on. The album is well paced, has killer hooks and groves, melody, Gillian's unique brand of humor, and, well, just plain rocks. \\"Born Again,\\" in this fan's opinion ranks among both Sabbath and Gillian's finest work. If you are a fan of Sabbath, Deep Purple/Gillian or old-school rock in general, due yourself a favor and give \\"Born Again\\" a listen.elease, one of the major criticisms of the album was its mix.

B000BP86OG|1.0|I loved Permission To Land and The Darkness' live show I attended was fantastic so I expected something great the second time around.  Instead what I found was a weak effort watered down with significant overproduction and lame melodies.  Where are the great hooks and hard-driving beat that defined the first album?  If Permission To Land reminded me of AC/DC then One Way Ticket is a sad Whitesnake imitation.  Painful....

B000AU9UYM|5.0|I agree with almost all the good reviews.  Best Batman film, etc.. My only complaint (it's really more of a question) was why did Batman seem so mentally moribund?  <br /> <br />Where was the great mind, the detective side of him?  There was a bit, but he seemed much more dependent on the intelligence of others (like the Freeman character) than coming up with his own ideas. <br /> <br />One of the things I always loved about the character was that he's a \\"self-made\\" superhero. A HUGE part of that is his intellect, a feature that really sets him apart from a lot of super power superheroes. I got the feeling Bale's Batman had done his physical homework...but that he may have been cutting class to do it. <br /> <br />That having been said, I can't really say that ANY of the live action Batman movies have ever done a good job of this (the best may have been the Adam West Batman...and what does THAT say?) <br /> <br />That having been said, I'm going to buy this DVD...and I do not own any of the other Batman movies in my home collection. <br /> <br />So there you go.
0316776963|4.0|Like Garrison Keillor, Sedaris can take mundane events and tease insights out of them in a funny way.  He doesn't always like the other characters in his life, however, which sometimes come across as mean - - I find myself wondering how his family reacts when they read these essays.  Of course, he doesn't always like himself much either, which makes some of the stories poignant and some just plain sad behind the laughs.<br /><br />Just about essay works well standing alone.  My only complaint is that they don't work so well taken as a collection.  Several of them concern his experiences living in France but many of them address other topics, such as growing up in North Carolina, lisping, trying to succeed as a performance artist, teaching in an art institute (unsuccessfully), or dealing with the quirks of his family.<br /><br />The title of the book is one of the sentences that he \\"successfully\\" produced in a French language course.  The book as a whole would be much stronger if it were built around a single theme, such as the experiences of an American living in France.  The other essays could get bumped into a different collection about his family, or whatever.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|First off, Gina T. Douglas's review is probably only as good as the kind of music she listens to. Its obvious her tastes are nowhere near this genre of music. I doubt she has heard even an ounce of First Impressions or any Strokes album for that matter. What could people like Ms. Douglas possibly have against the Strokes and their music? Is it the fact that since their beginning, the music industry has had to accept a more level field among musical genres? Are J.Lo and Mariah not selling enough albums? Only a pitiful reason like this would be enough for pitiful people to give a validless one star to such a great album like First Impressions. <br /> I have been a Strokes fan for two years now. I was first taken by Room on Fire and followed with ITI. While both great albums, Room on Fire lacked the passion found only in ITI and replaced with more generality. First Impressions nicely wedges itself inbetween, grasping the essence of ITI yet contracting the vagueness of ROF. Such vagueness can be found in songs like \\"Killing Lies\\", \\"15 Minutes\\", and \\"Ask Me Anything\\", but there's still so much left to make this album nothing short of great.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris, an intelligent, thoughtful, and skillful writer, says what he thinks about faith and about religion.  The book is not politically correct, which is a real virtue; readers will have no difficulty following his unambiguous (and often caustic) language and clear logic.  If readers bring a closed mind to the book - - what a shame - - they are likely to become angry and remain unchanged; Harris brings a harsh mirror to the issues and many will not be able to peer into it.  If readers bring an open mind - - a sensible thing to do given the stakes for us all - - they will be made to see things for what they really are.  I was in violent agreement with most of what he wrote.   <br /> <br />It should be hard for any intelligent, open-minded reader to not be angry for the net damage religion has done (and continues to do) to societies across the world (sure it does some good, but the bad outweighs that by orders of magnitude - - just look at every day's newspapers for the list of deaths inflicted on innocents by those clearly posessed with the absolute truths of their religion).    <br /> <br />A world-wide, rational debate on these frightfully important but never openly discussed issues has to somehow begin.  Hopefully this book will spark that debate, for the good of all mankind.
B0006B29WA|5.0|There is not a single song that can be described as bad on this album. Sure, the background singing in TELL HER TONIGHT is terrible, but besides that, what is there to complain about? I've noticed from the reviews that a lot of people love this album or just don't get it. Luckily I am one of the love-it people, and maybe you are too if you give the album a chance.<br /><br />JACQUELINE--This song starts out slow and soft and you're not sure if you care to listen to the rest of the song. But 40 seconds into the song, it picks up and turns itself into an awesome rock song with some serious guitar playing and drumming. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />TELL HER TONIGHT--While this song is the worst song on the original album, it still maintains not being bad nevertheless. The \\"home demo\\" on the album DARTS OF PLEASURE, however, is so bad that it's hilarious. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy<br /><br />TAKE ME OUT--This was the song that Franz Ferdinand performed on one of the worst episodes of Saturday Night Live that I've ever seen that got me into the band's music. The awesome lead guitar and great tune are perfection. A must to hear. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />THE DARK OF THE MATINEE--The best song on the album. It even outdoes TAKE ME OUT. The lyrics are a bit soft, but the chorus is awesome and so is the music. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />AUF ACHSE--This is the softest song on the album, and it still is good nevertheless. The singing, piano, and bass all add up to make a good song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />CHEATING ON YOU--This fast paced song is probably better than TELL HER TONIGHT, but nothing else on the album. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />THIS FIRE--A very good song. Very fast paced, though not nearly as much as CHEATING ON YOU. The drums go very good with the guitarrythem. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.<br /><br />DARTS OF PLEASURE--This song is also very good, but not quite as much as THIS FIRE. It transits well between the soft rock and the hard rock. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson.<br /><br />MICHAEL--This song was based on an experience of a friend of the band's. It has good rock, especially the lead guitar playing. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />COME ON HOME--A relatively good song, though the chorus isn't that great. It's no match for TAKE ME OUT or THE DARK OF THE MATINEE, but it's still a good song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy<br /><br />40'--I was first introduced to this song from the trailer of IN GOOD COMPANY, and recognized it immediately when I heard it. It's a pretty good song, featuring the soon-to-become- frequent la-la-la-la-la-las. (They are featured frequently in the next Franz Ferdinand album, YOU COULD HAVE IT SO MUCH BETTER). Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.<br /><br />THIS FFFIRE--I really don't see much of a difference between this song and THIS FIRE. The assemblance of the lyrics is a bit different, but otherwise it almost sounds exactly the same. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy and Paul Thomson.<br /><br />VAN TANGO--The only Franz Ferdinand song so far to not be sung by Alex Kapranos. And it's a bit evident why. Nick McCarthy's voice isn't bad for singing, but he sings the song with a high pitch and lazy sound. He works better for backup, though it is always interesting to hear a song not sung by the lead singer. Featuring vocals by Nick McCarthy, Alex Kapranos, and Paul Thompson.<br /><br />SHOPPING FOR BLOOD--Okay, probably the worst song on the album. I haven't listened to it much, but I don't like it from what I've heard. Alex Kapranos's voice just wasn't meant to sing so low and rough. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Paul Thompson, and NickMcCarthy.<br /><br />ALL FOR YOU, SOPHIA--This song is rather repeatative, but it is appreciative after the last song. The chorus really goes deep into being repeatative, with the same four words being being repeated over and over and over again. Featuring vocals by Nick McCarthy and Alex Kapranos<br /><br />WORDS SO LEISURED--This song takes some of the words from DARTS OF PLEASURE, and puts them to a slow, soothing melody. However, I think they overdid the soothingness and slowness. It's just not enough of a song now. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos.
B0000027I6|5.0|If this were the only thing Roger Waters ever did it would unquestionably grant him entry into the pantheon of great artists.  Amused to Death is a cohesive work of unparalleled clarity, depth and shimmering beauty.  Mr. Waters has again conveyed to us with eloquent humor and touching humanity the absurdity of political machinations and war.  It is precisely for this that we owe him an unpayable debt of gratitude.  Indispensable...
B000000WZ4|4.0|I'll admit that I hated this when it first came out.  In fact, I hated it for many years.  I hated it until Playing the Angel came out and I was able to put this release in context.  I suppose Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion are to blame.  Ultra is a lot like the cigarette after sex.  The excitement was over after Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Wow, those are a couple of intense albums.  It's easy to dismiss Ultra as the also-ran for Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />The fact is, though, that after listening to this again and again, something occurs to you.  Depeche Mode had moved on and perhaps you hadn't yet.  It's hard to let go of the past, especially with music.  We tend to want to cement ourselves into an era that we truly enjoyed.  That doesn't mean that we should dismiss the future.  After Alan Wilder's departure and Dave's well documented battle with drugs, Depeche Mode got themselves back up and moved on.  This album proves that they had what it takes to provide music that matters. <br /> <br />When I first heard Barrel of a gun, my reaction was \\"Cool.  This album is going to continue where SoFaD left off\\".  I was then sadly disappointed when I found it was the only track that had that edgy, angst-ridden feel to it.  The rest just bored me.  Since then I've come to appreciate Ultra for what it is.  Depeche Mode had continued to reinvent themselves. <br /> <br />There are several interesting pieces that prove DM's continued relevance.  Check out Home, It's No Good, Useless and The Bottom Line for some Depeche Mode that could easily be called as classic as tunes like Halo, Sometimes, and the others we all love. <br /> <br />I can't bring myself to give this album the five stars that so many others have.  It's certainly not their best work, but it is DM and so far, that's more than enough. <br /> <br />If you're a casual fan or somebody who is interested in getting their feet wet, I'd recommend Violator, Black Celebration, or perhaps Some Great Reward for some older material.  However, anyone who considers themselves a fan should most definitely own Ultra.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|First Impressions of Earth is a great blend of everything a Strokes fan would want.  The same sound they originally came out with new fresh sounding songs really makes this album unique.  I highly reccommend this album.  Favorite song: Heart In a Cage <br />BUY IT!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|After having seen the movie twice, (and who pays to see a movie twice nowadays?) I had to get this soundtrack! It is simply wonderful.  Listening to each track is like imagining each scene over again.  After seeing the movie the first time on opening night several people in the audience were commenting on the wonderful music, on how 'lovingly-haunting' it was. This music was going to stick with us for days we all agreed. The music simply immersed you, it surrounded every scene perfectly.  Favorite tracks, well, hard to pick just one,  \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\" is violin magic.  \\"Darcy's Letter\\" almost makes me cry, but a good cry.  \\"Your Hands are Cold\\" is simply astounding music, you can see Darcy and Elizabeth together and feel the love.  It is worthy of an Oscar nomination!!
B00005JGAB|5.0|While The Sex Pistols were exploring the revolutionary sound that has been dubbed, \\"punk\\", in England, The Ramones were doing the same in the States.  The Ramones however added their own flavor to the quickly growing phenomenon.  While The Sex Pistols were all about rebellion, anarchy, and destroying the British government, The Ramones were all about simple four chord rockers with incredibly simple and stupid lyrics regarding the things that made rock famous in the first place; girls, dancing, and dope.  The songs are very short (only a few clock in at over two and a half minutes) and the whole album is only a half hour long but thats OK since if it had been any longer the whole thing would become old and redundant.  Maybe its because its the Ramones that are doing this but somehow it all works out just fine. <br /> <br />There's no real opening, the album just explodes with the three or four chord assault of, \\"Blitzkreig Bop\\", which has become one of the most recognizable sports anthems ever recorded.  The second track is just Joey Ramone talking about beating up a kid for two whole minutes.  Some tracks like, \\"Now I Want To Sniff Some Glue\\", are just the same four silly lines repeated over and over again but the steroid driven guitar riff and the fact that its only a minute and a half long make the song quite enjoyable.  There are a few suprises such as the almost romantic ditty, \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\", and the somewhat serious drug dealing number, \\"53rd And 3rd\\" but most every other song follows the same basic formula.  A few songs have some politcal values that somewhat rival the Sex Pistols but the rest is all about girls and parties.  The album ends with Joey yelling over and over again, \\"Today Your Love! Tomorrow The World!\\", and then it all comes crashing to a hault. <br /> <br />If your looking for the long sophisticated suites and writings of Pink Floyd or Genesis forget it, your not going to find it here.  If you're just looking for a good time as well as the reason for the fuss over the punk revolution of the late 70s then this is a prime purchase.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Not a wasted track on this one.  Blistering, tasteful guitar playing and perfect singing.  I like this much better than other recent Buddy Guy CDs.  The BLUES.  I also highly recommend \\"DJ Play My Blues\\" - get the multichannel SACD version of it if you've got a Super Audio CD player.
0307276902|5.0|This is one of those life-changing books, whether you are an addict, have a loved one who is battling addiction, or simply want to understand what it feels like to be addicted.  This book was painful to read - I literally hurt WITH James as he went through rehab.  I could not put it down and ended up staying awake way too late for 2 nights to finish it.  Be prepared to experience the full spectrum of emotions as you read this book.
B000063DIR|1.0|The original album, left alone, is 5 stats. This sound like crap with the new mix. It's really just low-level LA rock musicians that are willing to take a couple bucks for a day in the studio. <br />Sharon has really hit a new all-time low with ruining one of the most classic heavy metal albums ever made.
0792833201|5.0|Is the film slightly cornball? Yes, and forgivably so.<br /><br />The fun and fascination erase all shortcomings.<br /><br />The little girl who sees spirits that the family can't. The shocked team of paranormal investigators. The small psychic with big ability.<br /><br />Infused are Speilberg type moments of humor. Like the college investigator who brags about filming a toy truck moving across the floor... in time lapse, the \\"event\\" took several hours. At that moment, the bedroom door to the missing girl is opened... and all items in the room are levitating and flying in cyclone fashon. Cut... next scene, with the lead investigator holding a tea cup... rattling as her hand shakes. Brilliant!<br /><br />A young niece of mine once said she thought the film's \\"effects\\" were \\"cheesy.\\"  Well, this girl grew up in the \\"lord of the Rings\\" era. The effects were spectacular for it's day, and the misty, vaporous ghost manifestations are VERY effective! The \\"beastly\\" manifestations at the end of the film are truly terrifying.<br /><br />The musical score is masterful, composed by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith.<br /><br />Not a \\"realistic\\" horror movie, in any sense of the word... but it's engrossing.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00003CXI1|1.0|Having seen Lord Of The Rings & Harry Potter Movies, I was mystified how it has such a large following.  I thought it was a bunch of purple-prosed jibberish with a fragmented, weak plot.  Not to mention the other detrimental negative apects of the questionable handling of the magic/occult. <br /> <br />Having seen The Chronicles of Narnia; I think I can understand why the world would play up LOTR & Harry.   <br /> <br />Narnia is such a magnificent work with thematic purpose that the prince of this world would attempt to overshadow it as an inferior comtemporary work compared to Tolkien's LOTR jibberish or Harry Potter confusing nonsense. <br /> <br />C.S. Lewis was a Christian and his work \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" is powerful. <br /> <br />Children should see Narnia - especially \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". Parents will be accountable to what they expose their children to.
B000000IRB|5.0|I had many issues of this album. I had it on LP, on ordinary CD, on CD from the Box Set and Japan LP version. I also listen and compared MOFI CD with SACD version. In the end MOFI Gold disc sounds the best. For those who have difficulty hearing I recommend syringing their ears first.
B00005IC2H|5.0|How does one describe the sound of glaciers drifting slowly apart; a lonely ribbon of highway; the most beautiful girl you'll never see; the insanity and wonder of a planet in a solar system that is perhaps just beyond the reach of reason or heaven...Sigur Ros.
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is the first movie i saw of my favourite actor \\"Jake Gyllenhaal\\". Yeah his part is small in the movie but it was amazing! also Quaid's performance is quite catching.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I loved this film. I have always been a big E. Annie Proulx fan and the movie certainly did her short story (of the same title) the proper justice.<br />Aside from the absolutely breathtaking cinematography and perfectly customized soundtrack, this film encompasses the turmoil and heartbreak of an impossible love story. It is sad and touching and yet also a harsh reminder of the current of prejudices that comes up hard against homosexual/homosocial behavior.<br />I praise Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger for their performances. They managed to be both passionately sexy and boyishly uncertain in their characters...tough and yielding simultaneously. I imagine they have done the author of this story proud. There was very little deviation from the original text, which, unfortunately, is a rarity. In my humble opinion, it will be difficult for either of these actors to top what they have done here. Bravo. Highly recommended.
1878424319|5.0|The information and reminders in this book are effective. They are simple concepts that work when applied. The way the book is written, everything makes perfect sense, and when I remember to follow the four agreements, I feel an immediate shift inside, to a freer feeling.  <br /> <br />This is a great book for the reminders, and to help with personal liberation from unnecessary suffering.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|KORN is one of my favourite bands that i've been listenin' to through the past years, yes this album is totally different than all their last albums but still it's great, check out tracks like 'twisted transistor' 'open up' 'liar' 'seen it all' and the wierd 'tearjerker'... <br /> <br />This album is a new opening door for a whole new Korn that had prooved that they still rule!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I don't think Coldplay's 'X and Y' is as sensational as 'Rush of Blood to the Head' (for me the best album ever) but it's close. Similar yes, but lacking the emotional power of the lyrics that accompanied Rush. Musically I don't detect much of a difference...seemingly it appears to be an appendage of the previous but that sits well with me. I am surprised that some listeners could not differentiate between Coldplay and U2 or Radiohead when tuning in to a couple of the album's songs for the first time...I would know them anywhere.
B000005RG7|3.0|Originally released in 1982, not bad for a reunion lp when most long time Uriah Heep fans had assumed they were washed up. Now that keyboardist John Sinclair and vocalist Peter Goalby were new members in the Heep rank, they seem to breathe new life into the band. Of course, guitarist Mick Box always does his chore well on ALL Heep releases. Tunes I liked more than I thought I would were \\"Too Scared To Run\\", \\"Running All Night\\", their Small Faces cover \\"Tin Soldiers\\" and the lp's single \\"That's The Way It Is\\". A decent album rock title, do check it out for yourself.
B000002TWN|5.0|IM 14 RIGHT NOW AND THIS SONG BRING BACK SOME BANGIN' MEMORIES OF '95 '96 WHEN THIS CD CAME OUT I LOVE THE SONG \\" LADY \\" AND \\" BROWN SUGAR \\" BECAUSE THIS REMINDS ME OF THE GOOD TIMEZ IN DA SUMMER .
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I can't believe these guys are a bunch of rich kids of privledge. Ignore the negative reviews of this album. This is far better than their second album, and I would say this is as good as their first. I think any critism of this album is going to stem from timing and not from anything this album lacks. Years have passed since Is This It was released, we're all older, and my guess is that the people giving this album a negative review have become way too bitter and jaded during that time. I was extremely surprised at how good this was and I was expecting something pretty good. It is true, what the other reviewers are saying: YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AT LEAST TWICE BEFORE YOU GET HOW GOOD IT ACTUALLY IS. By the third listen you will be hooked.    My friend had mentioned that his voice sounds very different in this album, I did not really hear that so much. The missing sound effects are barely noticed because they've pretty much nailed their act. I would say this album is going to be one of the catchiest albums this year.     I realize that some of us don't think we can still be cool and like a band like the Strokes because they are too popular and too much of an obvious choice, but the reason why is because they are so good. Also really cool people don't need to prove themselves and will not be ashamed to own this album. It's also a great album to exercise to. Thank you Strokes, because of you I won't have to wear my fat jeans til June.
0345357116|5.0|I really love the world of Tolkien's Middle-Earth.  If you do too, then I'd recommend this book.  When reading the LoTR trilogy, and The Silmarillion, you will learn bits of pieces of long-forgotten stories.  Here, you get an opportunity to learn the backstory.  The book is comprised of short stories, but still could be read from beginning to end.  My favorite stories were learning more of about the Palantir Seeing-Stones, the backstory for the 5 wizards, etc.
0446577383|2.0|Just finished The Camel Club and I have to say I felt it was better than his last book by far, though far from his best work.  I enjoyed the read, and it even kept me in suspense for a while wondering who \\"Oliver Stone\\" really was and just how the bad guys were going to pull off their plan.  While the book had it's moments; overall it strained credibility and plausibility just a bit too much to be really enjoyable. <br /> <br />Mr. Baldacci has a thing for the Secret Service; and two of our hero's in this book are agents.  One is on the last leg of his career and the other is a rising star.  Then there is the Camel Club itself and a few \\"love interest\\" women for our hero's thrown in to boot.  Add to that mix one US President, one NIC Intelligence czar (a shadow of Don Rumsfield perhaps?), several government spooks/agents/killers, some Arab terrorists, and even a few North Koreans for good measure; mix with a secret government training facility and you have the makings of a really good book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately it doesn't mix up right.  I still don't know why the North Koreans were even in the book, other than to give our hero's someone to beat up on.  I'll admit the  execution of the terrorists big plot was a bit surprising; I even liked it.  But the sheer implausibility of it is it's biggest strength and weakness all rolled into one.  But I assume we read these books to be entertained so I am ready and willing to \\"go along for the ride\\" even though my good sense rebels against what I'm reading. <br /> <br />Mr. Baldacci's constant political harping, at odds with the current administration to put it mildly, comes off as a bit preachy.  It wasn't the deal-breaker for me as with some other reviewers, but I felt like I was being lectured to and it hurt the book in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Overall I'd say wait for the paperback; definitely not worth the hardback price.
B0000007BI|5.0|Franz Xaver Sussmayr's finishing touches of Mozart's requiem is by far my favorite version. It sounds more Mozart-like than other new interpretations out there, and it has the same \\"classical\\" feel for death upon special people. Philippe Herreweghe handles the periodical Champs-Elysees Orchestra and the choirs almost perfectly, and the tempi are quite accurate as from the 1790's. The soloists, especially Bostridge, sing their parts well. Highly recommended for those who are sick and tired of either Karajan's slow and dull pace, or Gardiner's unpolished orchestral sounds.
015626224X|5.0|In this autobiographical piece, Orwell's writing demonstrates many impressive qualities. <br /> <br /> First off, he makes the story appealing by basing it around infinitely fascinating characters. In addition to making it a more than enjoyable read, these \\"down and out\\" display many characteristics that allow the reader to identify more with them. You can't help but smile when you read about Boris's determined optimism, and the miserable cook's nervous breakdowns are downright hilarious. Orwell is able to introduce the reader to people they feel like they've known all their lives. In this way, Orwell smashes through many stereotypes regarding those in poverty. <br /> <br /> Orwell also displays his impressive ability to persuade the reader again and again without seeming too obtrusive. He uses ethos almost to the point of abuse, and pathos and logos are pervasively present as well. Although there are a few faults in his arguments- even he acknowledges them- most of his points are well-constructed and conclusive. The most impressive quality of his arguments, however, is that he offers logical solutions to the problems that he identifies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is WAY more than a just look into the life of the poor. It is a thought-provoking, eye-opening, and, most importantly, enjoyable story.
B0000009TT|5.0|You can read the previous reviews to get the story on this album, so I won't repeat it.  I will cut to the chase to explain why you should get this.<br /><br />There are some different versions of some songs, and some different mixes of others (most notably the \\"Sleep Dirt\\" stuff without the added vocals), but basically they're songs available on 4 previously released albums.  Those 4 were packaged by Warner Brothers thematically - live songs on one album, orchestral on another, instrumental on another, etc.  From the very first one, Zappa's albums were more than a collection of songs.  If you listen to 200 Motels or Uncle Meat, you get a wonderful mix of all kinds of different styles, live and studio recordings, and other juxtapositions, sometimes in the same song.  He often did deliberately harsh and abrupt edits. Zappa hated it when people tried to pigeon-hole his music (good luck, anyway!). That is precisely the beauty of \\"Lather\\".  As a whole, it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />If you don't own this music in any form, buy this first, because you will get a clearer sense of what the artist intended to do.  Eventually you will want the other albums because there is some music not found on Lather.  If you already own the other 4 albums, you are probably a big enough Zappa freak that you'll want to get it anyway, for the reasons I mentioned.
6305949980|4.0|I videotaped this movie off television several years ago, only to discover that the dang thing turned out so poorly as to be almost unwatchable.  Snow when there wasn't supposed to be any, and lots and lots of Halloween and Christmas confetti.  I dutifully screened it (and kind of enjoyed it nonetheless) but made a mental note to rent or buy a cleaner copy at the first available opportunity. <br /> <br />But you know how it is, life gets in the way.  I didn't get around it again until this past holiday season, when I finally felt the urge for something a little offbeat and maybe a little subversive to help slip a bit of tartness into all those sugar plums.  NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS certainly filled the bill--even though it is actually surprisingly sweet natured itself. <br /> <br />The link between Halloween and Christmas was always something that as a child, I always assumed everyone \\"got.\\"  For me Halloween was the beginning of the magic season.  If spring and summer were all about down-to-earth, patriotic holidays, mid-fall brought us into the season of the otherworldy and supernatural--starting off a little scary, but ending up with peace on earth and good will toward men, with lots of goodies and feasting along the way.  I think Tim Burton may have been thinking along the same lines when he concocted this delightful tale. <br /> <br />Of course, aficiados will be quick to tell you that NIGHTMARE was not actually directed by Burton merely based on an original story by him.  I won't argue, nor do I want to take anything away from director Harry Selick nor from any of the talented scene designers and camera people.  But the film does have Burton's darkly comic yet nonetheless sweet natured sensibility written all over it.   <br />And speaking of the visuals, that was the element that was ruined for me the first time out by that inferior video.  The visuals didn't really come out, and to the extent that I could sense their outlines, they didn't seem like they would be all that interesting anyway. How wrong I was. At his best, Burton creates whole new worlds, and that is precisely what his collaborators and stand-in director have done here.  In fact, he they've created more than one (\\"Halloween Land\\" AND \\"Christmas Land\\"). <br /> <br />Most kids reach a stage around 12 or 13 when they cultivate a taste for perverse humor.  (I call it the Charles Addams stage, since that's when I first discovered his cartoons--and coincidentally when the series THE ADDAMS FAMILY made its debut).  Burton is a few years younger than I and probably caught the TV show in reruns, but he definitely picked up that sensibility along the way.  Morticia and Gomez actually had a sweet side, but the cartoon image of them and the rest of the clan perched in the rafters and about to pour molten lead on Christmas carolers below is one that I've never forgotten.  (And neither did the makers of ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES since they chose to re-enact that very cartoon as that film opens).  But Burton adds a more whimsical element.  Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, DOES get it.  After much contemplation, he begins to comprehend the spirit of Christmas.  <br /> <br />The rest of Halloween Town is in \\"hot lead pouring\\" mode, but Jack sees something else there. Actualizing that vision is farcically beyond him, and that's the heart of the movie.  Jack is really a sweetheart, and he saves the day (that day being Christmas Eve), wins the girl and destroys the baddest of bad guys (the awesomely awful Boogie Oogie).  It's nothing less than you would expect, but the creators have been so imaginative in getting there that you're only to willing allow them a little corn at the ending.  Candy corn, that is. <br /> <br />
0767830555|4.0|I was really quite surprised with this movie- didn't think it was going to be this good. I think to really understand this movie you have to look quite carefully at Travis- I think two things really drove him to do what he did in the end...first of all he is of course fed up with the grittiness and grim of society...and then I also think the extent to of which he experienced loneliness was also very, very obvious. He's searching for love in all the wrong places...and doesn't know why.  <br /> <br />I think the movie delivers several powerful messages...one of which someone already mentioned- taking matters into your own hands and doing what you want to change things around you that you don't like-and then also I think it pointed out very blantely how much people put on a front- when really inside there lives are filled with things they hate. I think this was obvious in Travis's life and Iris's life and also probably true of Betsy's life also.  <br /> <br />Gotta say I love, love, love scene #15- \\"you lookin' at me??\\". That was just great, I've played that scene over and over again many many times. <br />
B000000YBQ|5.0|If time travel were ever possible, my destination should be The Village Vanguard, NYC on June 25th, 1961.  On this day the Bill Evans Trio played two sets in the afternoon and three sets in the evening. The results are the ultimate in beauty in a musical form.  In my opinion, Bill Evans, Scott LaFaro (on double bass) & Paul Motian (on drums) created moments that no other jazz piano trio will ever surpass or be equaled to in the future. <br /> <br />The recordings of the day at the Village Vanguard are available on two CDs-\\"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\\" and \\"Waltz for Debby.\\"  If you ever feel like enjoying piano jazz, please try \\"Waltz for Debby.\\"  I would accept my fate if I had to listen to nothing but this CD for the rest of my life.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|'Confessions' is a very ballsy bassy European mix and makes 'ray of light' sound like a dated electronic joke. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is her greatest ballad ever. I hope common folks who don't buy this hear it on the airwaves soon. So many great songs to enjoy after getting past the track 1 ABBA single.
B000002L80|5.0|\\"Little Creatures\\" is one of my favorite Talking Heads CD, not because it's so much better than the others, but because it is so different.  Its catchy melodies and lyrics edge the group closer to a pop sound than the punk roots that gave us \\"Psycho Killer\\" and \\"The Book I Read.\\" The hilarious inanity of earlier albums is downplayed here for a more mature, though hardly serious, take on life.  It addresses the lives of their fans as they grew older with the Heads--having children, jobs, and lives that still did not make complete sense.  \\"Creatures of Love\\" has a twang reminiscent of country western music, but with Byrne singing, it becomes mournful; the lyrics talk of having children:  \\"Little creature of love/With two arms and two legs/From a moment of passion/Now they cover the bed.\\"  The catchy \\"Stay Up Late,\\" a song about two kids who want desperately to wake up their baby sibling to \\"make him stay up all night,\\" portrays exactly the opposite of what parents would want.  \\"The Road to Nowhere\\" begins with the melodic strains of a chorus, then shifts into an electronic beat as the Heads reflect on lives that are not quite working out.  This CD is a must-have for all Talking Heads fan, even those who prefer the New Wave and African-influenced albums. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
0156027321|3.0|I've heard so many people say this book is great that when my club selected it, I figured \\"what the heck?\\"  It had already been sitting on my bookshelf for about a year based on the good things I'd heard about it, but I could never get myself to open it up since the description on the back sounded so boring. Not wanting to be a book club flake by not reading the book, I forced myself through it -- I literally gave myself a nightly page requirement to get through in order to keep me motivated. I know it's supposed to be deep and meaningful, and it had some very thoughtful ideas, but what a snoozer to get through.  (I was literature major in college and have a lot of patience for slow, literary reads, but this was a lot even for me!)  I didn't care about the book at all until the last 100 pages or so, when I finally started enjoying it.  Then it ended and I was unmoved.  I wasn't sure the destination was worth the journey.  Perhaps I was expecting too much from it based on all the hoopla. Also, maybe it needs to sink in a little longer or I'll find that I enjoy it more after discussing it with my fellow book clubbers (as so often happens).  All in all though, I would have a hard time urging someone else to pick it unless you have a lot of time to kill and nothing else to do... you know, maybe if you're lost at sea or something.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Exquisite piano work - if you don't have this one you're really missing out.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Though it premiered in 1959 and the director still had many more movies to make (PSYCHO among them), NORTH BY NORTHWEST seems like every Hitchcock movie rolled into one.  There is mistaken identity, murder and attempted murder, a love triangle, a harrowing car-ride sequence, VERTIGO-like \\"cliffhangers,\\" one suspenseful camera shot after another, and a great Bernard Herrmann score.  Cary Grant is superb, and the supporting cast of Eva-Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau could not be bettered.  The film's \\"glorious Technicolor\\" fits the lavishness of its setting and plot.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember skipping past this show once or twice when it was on the air, but now I'm sorry I didn't give it a chance. A friend loaned me the DVDs, and my wife and I delighted in them. There was humor, action, grit, character development, and so much potential.<br /><br />I think what most appealed to me was the diversity of viewpoints represented on the ship. For instance, Shepherd Book represented a Christian voice who was set among his \\"den of thieves\\" composed literal thieves as well as a respected, professional prostitute, a captain who had lost his faith after feeling abandoned by God, and a skeptical but fragile genius in River. The Shepherd had a complex past, and the tension was set for some meaningful spiritual conversation which appeared only in bits before the show was cancelled.<br /><br />I liked the fact that they were not guiding diplomats through negotiations or fighting for the Federation (as in Star Trek Next Gen). Rather, their concerns are very mundane (e.g., where can they find a job and get paid), and they float as \\"losers\\" on the out-skirts of the territory of the space Alliance (which seems more bureaucratic than innately evil, unlike, say, the Empire from Star Wars). I also like the fact that they use \\"futuristic\\" curse words (\\"gorram\\" and \\"ruttin'\\") as well as Chinese expletives instead of the standard and hackneyed English vernacular.<br /><br />One reviewer complained of the sex in the show. I agree that there is some gratuitous sex to be found, but since the show is on DVD, a remote can be employed to get past that. As for the alleged \\"nudity\\", the only examples I recall are in the pilot episode where the prostitute's bare back is shown (again, the remote can skip it) and in the episode where the captain appears naked from the back, including his buttocks. The latter is used purely for comic effect and is not sexual in nature.<br /><br />In short, the show had more depth and well-roundedness than any sci-fi production that I have seen, and I've seen quite a few.  Don't hesitate to rent it, and after that, consider buying it if you're into collecting DVDs.'t hesitate to rent it, and after that, consider buying it if you're into collecting DVDs.
B0009Y33H4|3.0|I own this as an album. The only reason I purchased it was for the so-called 7 minute version of \\"Nadir's Big Chance.\\" That cut, despite what the cd package says, is only 3:30, similar to the tune on Hammill's solo work of that title. As a VDGG fan, this was always the my least favorite recording in their catalog. I don't think the recording is that well done. Although when I first purchased the album, anything by VDGG was welcome. VDGG has better offerings such as \\"Godbluff\\" or \\"Pawn Hearts.\\" If, like me, you want to hear an \\"extended version\\" of \\"Nadir's Big Chance,\\" buy Hammill's solo work of the same title which is better than \\"Vital\\" anyway.
0812975219|5.0|This is one of the most amazing and fascinating book I have read in recent times. In terms of Amazon stars, even 100 star rating would be less for this book.    Normally, we have been trained to look for order & organization in every aspect of our life. Right from our education, career to friends & life partner etc. However, if you reflect for a moment on how you \\"landed\\" onto your job or how you got to be \\"friends\\" with your friends or how you \\"met\\" your spouse, you will realize the random nature of the world.    Overall, this is an eye opener book. It brings out so many obvious but hidden facets of life. Each and every paragraph, page is packed with words of wisdom & interesting insights. However, nothing is underlined or highlighted. It is up to the reader to pickup the diamonds & pearls.    Some of the things I found fascinating & illuminating were ...    (1) Successor bias ... how our process of determining successful strategies/people is so flawed.  (2) How outliers events are undervalued (Black Swan problem) and how one can use it in one's own favor.(hint: out-of-money options)    You may find the author a bit quirky and too idealistic at times. But I guess that is the trait of geniuses.     I would highly, highly recommend this book ...    -Sachin    PS: Also checkout the excellent list of books in the reference section of this book.
0440214041|3.0|When two Supreme Court justices are assassinated on the same night, there is plenty of speculation as to who the assassin or assassins are and why the judges were murdered. Like many others, law student Darby Shaw thinks she knows the motive. She writes a brief, soon to be known as The Pelican Brief, and shows it to her law professor/lover, Thomas Callahan. Unfortunately, he shows it to a friend of his who works for the FBI, who passes it along, and it falls into the wrong hands. When Callahan is killed by a car bomb, Darby realizes someone wants her dead and she goes on the run. She hooks up with Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham and the two of them try to stay alive long enough to expose the truth.<br /><br />This was an exciting but implausible thriller. Darby is a well-written character and it's nice to read a book with a strong, intelligent heroine. Unfortunately, it's not clear until well into the book what Darby's feelings for Callahan really were, it should have been clear earlier that she loved him and was not a student having an affair with a professor in order to get an A.  She conveniently has plenty of money, so she can use cash on the run, rather than leave a trail by using plastic. And it strains readers credibility that a law student can outwit trained assassins. Some of the other characters in the book blend into each other and I wasn't always clear as to who some of them were. Grisham does clear up some loose ends, but at the last minute, as if he suddenly remembered them.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the story is exciting enough to keep the reader turning pages and worth reading as long as you don't think too much about it.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Compared to the old laserdisc release of this opera, this new DVD is a joy to behold. To my eyes much loving attention has been lavished on restoring and cleaning up this disc with the result that the colours throughout are rich and saturated. While the quality of the video has been significantly improved the audio remains about the same as the laserdisc---- the addition of 5.1 DTS does not really offer any audible differences over the PCM stereo which incidentally is very good indeed. The DVD now offers subtitles in five languages including English. <br />In my opinion this production of the work stands head and shoulders  <br />over the competition. The entire cast, the musical direction of Abbado and the imaginative video direction of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle make this a winner all round. Standouts in the singers are von Stade and Montarsolo. <br />Compared to other Unitel releases of Ponnelle operatic productions on DVD this is be far the best to date.
B00005JOFO|5.0|As someone who has seen many movies in the last few weeks, I can say without a doubt that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is one of the best films to come out this holiday season. Heath Ledger does an amazing job, but so do Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and all of the other actors who aren't getting quite as much buzz. The story is about two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who fall in love while working together one summer. Because of the time period and where they live, they can't be together. What I found very sad while watching the movie is the realization that while society was even less accepting towards gay couples several decades ago, society still has a long way to go today. I would encourage everyone to go see this film, although unfortunately the bigoted people who most need to see it probably won't. Having read the short story that this movie is based on, I think the filmmakers did a really good job in adapting it. I would also recommend the short story, which I think adds even more depth to the movie whether read before seeing it or afterwards. My only complaint about the movie is that certain sections went on a little too long. One of the main plot points is that Ennis and Jack often get together under the guise of going on fishing trips, and I think that those scenes dragged on a little. However, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a well-acted and incredibly moving film.
0743454537|5.0|I became aware of Jodi Picoult after it was announced that she would be the guest speaker at our next \\"Library Foundation\\" event. Since *I'm* the one that's going to pick her up at the airport, I decided it would be nice to have a least ONE of her books to talk about on the hour-plus drive back to the hotel.<br /><br />One of the first things I discovered, was that she is often described as a writer of \\"women's fiction.\\" I scanned through some of her book descriptions and decided that I really couldn't see how the plot of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" would be any less interesting if the reader possessed a \\"Y\\" chromosome.<br /><br />I didn't get to read it immediately though. My wife (who reads VERY little fiction) had first dibs on our copy from the library, and I sat and watched as she sniffled and sobbed through parts of the book. She LOVED it despite her general disdain for fiction, and her TOTAL avoidance of \\"romance novels.\\" (She's *never* read one.)<br /><br />She assured me that this was a terrific book, and thought that I would really enjoy it.<br /><br />She was right. And a few negative reviews notwithstanding, I imagine a significant fraction of the population (regardless of gender) would, as well.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Sister's\\" involves a young girl (Kate) with a particularly aggressive form of leukemia that does not respond well to treatment. Kate is given a very small chance of survival past toddlerhood, and her ONLY hope is an infusion of donor-matched blood cells, but neither her parents or her older brother prove to be suitable donors.<br /><br />The parents are told that siblings OCCASIONALLY are \\"perfect\\" donors, and they set out to 'create' one. They go through a process of genetic selection, in essence 'choosing' the embryo that will be the 'perfect' donor.<br /><br />When Anna is born, her cord blood is utilized to help (by then, 2-year-old) Kate. No problem. There is absolutely nothing invasive about retreiving cord blood. It is taken from the umbilical cord after it is removed -and would otherwise be considered bio-waste.<br /><br />The issue develops later on, as Kate's health deteriorates, and Anna is used as the donor for everything from blood to bone marrow for her sister.<br /><br />Now 13, and with Kate in desperate need of a kidney (the endless treatments of chemotherapy and other drugs over the years have caused kidney failure), Anna is expected to provide one for her dying sister.

B00000G3PA|1.0|ever since The Day i saw this film, i've been searching (in vain) for the right word, metaphor or phrase to adequately describe how awful this film is.  After 8 years, the best i can do is to say that this film is indescribably awful.  this is the single worst movie i have EVER seen.  Not ONE of the worst...  THE WORST.
B000002LGA|5.0|I am always interested when an artist reflects artistically on his or her hometown. While it is true that Lou Reed grew up on Long Island and spent his college years in upstate NY, it is also arguably the case that New York City is the place that has been Lou's spiritual home, now for more than 40 years. It was in NYC that Lou, Sterling Morrison and John Cale formed the Velvet Underground, and it was here that they perfected their craft, playing dark yet trippy music at Andy Warhol's Factory, and garagy pre-punk at Max's Kansas City. For the longest time, Lou Reed has had a public image not unlike the image of NYC: brainy, somewhat decadent, cynical, and resilient.<br /><br />This is why it was a moment of high anticipation when, in 1989, Lou Reed released this, one of his finest solo records. NYC had gone through some challenging moments in the 80s, as had Lou Reed, but here, he takes pause to observe the world, to chronicle its happenings, and to arrive at some conclusions about it. NYC is a microcosm here, but Lou's focus is on some universals. For example, a song like Busload of Faith articulates the need for being self confident in the face of others whom you can't always count on. Good Evening Mr. Waldheim, Endless Cycle, and Last Great American Whale are among the songs here that draw upon topical headlines and give Lou a chance to editorialize. And Dime Store Mystery is Lou's heartfelt tribute to his recently departed one time mentor and friend, Andy Warhol.<br /><br />One other observation, and it's this: the reason why this record is so appropriately titled is that it sounds great and stripped down, and is thus evocative of the great punk history of New York. It marks the end of one era (the decadent 80s) and the beginnings of an attempted new era of truth and directness. It cuts to this truth, as does the experience of life in NYC. Lou Reed knows this life, still, but really displays his knowledge here.
B00092ZL80|5.0|The word is never be enough to describe this DVD's. This absolutely  one of the BEST DVD performing ever seen !! The sound quality of recording is awesome, the Pro Tools engineer really did a great job on mixing & mastering. We can hear all the details of the instruments, good separations & quality of the vocals. The picture also very good resolutions, the camera angle can bringing you in into the concerts. I saw EWF w/ All McKay bands on Jakarta Java Jazz Festival 2005, the performance also incredible. The booth groups are very entertaining, they've proof themself as one of the best music (entertainer) groups in the world. The horns sections is very solid. The former member of EWF esp. Phillip Bailey & Verdine White shows their best on this concerts. If you're a Chicago fan, you'll like Robert Lamm performance, he's very calm but never lose his pitch. When this band plays together at the opening and closing its really incredible... This is totally a 5+ star performance !!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MI4|5.0|The reason the Costello/Brodsky collaboration \\"Juliet Letters\\" is such a difficult listen is also why its the MOST SINGULARLY BRILLIANT ALBUM IN THE ENTIRE ELVIS COSTELLO DISCOGRAPHY! And this declaration is coming from a man who could write a thesis on \\"Armed Forces\\" and \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" in his sleep! The idea of setting \\"letters\\" to music has certainly been done before, but Costello sticks his neck out, both as a composer and singer in ways he'd never done before. Accompanying yourself with just a string quartet (no snarling guitars or euphonious keyboard filigrees,) is the surest way to test your mettle as a vocalist. And sure, sometimes Costello's voice isn't exactly the strongest, but like say, Billie Holliday it always seems to occur precisely when the lyric calls for it: check out \\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\" or \\"The Birds Will Still Be Singing\\" and you'll hear exactly what I mean. Even his ode to a chain letter, \\"This Offer Is Unrepeatable\\" serves up a cheeky bit of satire worthy of \\"Three Penny Opera.\\" Of course, you can only experience this album sporadically - could anyone watch \\"Death Of A Saleman\\" or \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" repeatedly without losing one's mind? Emotionally-wrought exercises like \\"Letters\\" take a lot out of you, even when you're merely the observer (or listener,) rather than the participant. But that's what makes the journey, however bittersweet, one worth taking.
B000002OX5|5.0|As you can tell (good People), Metamorpho likes to be amused sometimes (see other reviews).  But this album is a virtual TREASURE! I am even crying with laughter when I think about it.  It is so unique.  It is a one and only. And I knew it way back when, in the dark ages, when it was released on some substance called vinyl. But, take heart - I am not yet ready to star in Jurassic Park IV!<br /><br />  It is a laugh, it is a goof on ridiculous 60's AM teenage radio - and it works so well.  The genius of The Who is on full display here (pre-dating the rock opera \\"Tommy\\" by a few years). And, not only that, but you hear familiar musical themes that he later used for that record.<br /><br />  After \\"Armenia City in the Sky\\" with Townsend channeling the psychedelic mutterings a la Lennon of \\"Lucy in the Sky\\", we get into the full force of wit and humour as the \\"commercials\\" hit you between the tracks.  The imaginative humour of \\"Mary Anne with the Shaky Hand\\" is such a great adult joke. Not to mention the laugh we get when \\"Odorono\\" lets the singer down. Can you imagine? A thing like odor standing in our way for happiness? But these products that The Who hawk are no different then what we all are subjected to in life.  Their comedy reveals the absurdity of the world we live in. Obviously no product is the end-all answer to our dreams. But it is fun to hear the ridiculous lengths that are gone to just to sell you something.<br /><br />  The classic Who song \\"I Can See for Miles\\" is here.  Along with clever-well written tunes which are definitely worth your investigation.  One song which is great here is \\"I Can't Reach You\\". Townsends juxtaposition of extremes in personality make this an incredible tune.<br /><br />  The original album ran less than half of this remastered C.D.  That said, all the extra material is of high, and sometimes experimental, value. I gave this c.d. as a present recently.  If they get only 20% of it, they'll love it.  Finally, what is it with the Heinz Baked Beans? Is it some sort of esoteric sexual thing? Metamorpho (who usually knows alot) is most confused. Didn't they have an Ann-Margaret thing in the movie \\"Tommy\\"? With Townsend, you never know. But this album is a laugh and a pure joy to hear - again and again. Accolades. Enjoy and have fun people.  Yours..... Metamorphothe Heinz Baked Beans? Is it some sort of esoteric sexual thing? Metamorpho (who usually knows alot) is most confused.

B000067DNC|4.0|The second season of STARGATE SG1 produced a series that is starting to mature. The plot lines do not rely so much on finding old earth civilization scattered all about the universe. New and creative ideas are introduced. The season also matures in that there are many plot lines begun and left for later episodes to be resolved. Some of these are not even resolved during the course of the season. The show makes for entertaining television even if a lot of the science is hokey. Personally, the science does not bother me near as much as the linguistics. Practically everyone in the universe speaks English. <br /> <br />Synopses of the episodes appear below: <br /> <br />The season starts off with a bang and resolves last season's cliffhanger. The SG1 crew had violated orders and transported themselves to the location where Daniel suspected the invasion fleet was leaving from. They found themselves on one of the ships participating in the invasion of Earth. The episode opens with the fleet's arrival. Bumbling politicians on Earth don't realize the threat and it is only a matter of time before the invasion begins. The only hope is the SG1 team who will have to recruit allies, destroy both ships and give up any chance of surviving themselves. <br /> <br />In the Line of Duty - While evacuating some refugees, Capt. Clark gets infested with a ghoul. The SG crew manages to capture her before she can wreak too much damage. Her ghoul makes a startling claim. It claims to be part of a ghoul resistance. Still, no one trusts it. They think she is part of a plot to wreak destruction on Earth and other happenings seem to bear this out. It seems another ghoul is on the loose. Clark's ghoul claims that the other one is an assassin sent to kill her. There does not seem to be much chance of the captain surviving no matter the truth of the situation. <br /> <br />Prisoners - The SG1 team makes its way to a world that seems deserted at first. Soon, however, they encounter a man who asks them for help. Not knowing what else to say, they offer their help and are then caught up in a bright beam of light. The next thing they know, they are before a tribunal charging them with trespassing and helping a prisoner to escape. Both charges carry life imprisonment and the transportation to the prison planet is by way of another stargate. The prison is very hellish and is an environment of \\"might makes right\\". They are aided by a mysterious old woman.  With her help, they manage to get the local gate working and with her, return to Earth. There, she learns all about the SG program and they learn they she was called \\"the destroyer of worlds\\". This genie won't go back into the bottle. <br /> <br />The Gamekeeper - in a rather silly episode, the SG1 team finds themselves on a seemingly deserted but otherwise lovely planet. Besides the park like environment, all they find are a bunch of strange pods with humans in them. While investigate the pods, they are captured and find themselves reliving their worst memories. They are actually present in the tragedies of their own lives and, worse, they have a strange audience. Part of the audience is the gamekeeper is seems devoted to forcing them to explore the endless variations inherent in their tragedies. The crew just wants out. <br /> <br />Need - The team investigates a planet that seems to be inhabited by ghoul slaves. When Daniel rescues a princess, they learn that the planet is not inhabited by ghouls. Instead, they are humans who managed to throw off the ghouls several centuries before. They maintain their independence by continuing to mine the stargate mineral and sending it through to the ghouls who assume that everything is operating normally and have no idea that the humans are free. Things get complicated when the team is sentenced to labor in the mines and they get worse when the princess falls in love with Daniel. She uses one of the healing sarcophagi to fix him up after he is hurt and repeated exposure gets him addicted to this unhealthy process. In the process, he begins to lose his mind. <br /> <br />Thor's Chariot - Stargate command gets a message from the planet protected by Thor last season. The ghouls have invaded and things look grim. Since the ghouls were only able to get a foothold because the SG1 team destroyed Thor's hammer, they feel a responsibility to go back and help. While part of the team tries to hold the ghouls off, the others go off in search of the legendary Thor's chariot. They are hoping it is a weapon to fight the ghouls. Instead, it turns out to be substantially less...and more. They have a new ally.  <br /> <br />Message in a Bottle - The SG1 crew explores a world that shows evidence of a highly advanced civilization which has been extinct for millennia. They bring back an artifact in order to study it. Expose to energy activates it and it begins to reproduce and take over the complex. They think of it as a disease and treat it as such with limited effect but they are fighting a losing battle. It turns out that it is not just a disease, it is an alien intelligence and the problem is how to communicate with it before everyone dies. <br /> <br />Family - The SG1 crew gets word that Teal'c's son has been abducted by Apothis. Everyone realizes that this has been done so that Teal'c can be lured back and captured. It's just not that simple. Teal'c finds that his wife has been remarried to an old friend and jealousy rears its head. What makes matters worse is that the rescue attempt on the son does not go off as planned. He has become an agent for Apothis and he has a larger goal than just capturing his father. He wants to destroy the Earth. <br /> <br />Secrets - This is a two story episode. Daniel and Teal'c head back to Abydos to keep a 1 year reunion promise and see that the stargate there is not buried. When they get there, he finds his long lost wife, pregnant by Apothis. It seems that the ghouls go dormant when their hosts are pregnant. She is due to deliver in several days and then the ghoul will awake again. Meanwhile, another ghoul, an enemy of Apothis, wants to kidnap the child. Back on earth, Col. O'Neill and Capt. Clark head to Washington to receive the air medal for their part in defeating the ghoul ships. While there, a reporter tries to confirm rumors of the stargate's existence. He knows too much and there has been a leak. The consequences of that are deadly. <br /> <br />Bane - When the SG! Team investigates a new planet, they find signs of a high civilization but which is completely devoid of anyone. Then they are attacked by the \\"mosquitoes\\" from hell; giant things, about the size of bats with scorpion-like tales. Teal'c is bitten and the crew makes a hasty escape through the stargate. The damage is already done. Teal'c gets sicker and sicker. He's dying and even the ghoul inside of him cannot help. It seems that the organism laid some eggs and is feeding directly off of his body. When he \\"hatches\\" he will spread the bugs and humanity will be doomed. Meanwhile, Teal'c is driven by powerful instincts to hide and tries to do so by escaping the mountain facility and fleeing into the city. <br /> <br />The Tok'Ra Part 1 - Several episodes back, Capt. Clark became the unwitting host of a ghoul. It turns out that was not a run of the mill ghoul but a member of resistance movement. That ghoul gave its life saving hers. Ever since, she has had strange memories and thoughts. They are the leftovers of her former ghoul. Now, SG1 has gone in search of this resistance movement called the Tok'Ra. They wish to form an alliance. The Tok'Ra, however, are suspicious. They are doubly so since the earth party evinces a reluctance to serve as hosts. Since the alliance looks like it will not take place, the Tok'Ra are also reluctant to let the stargate team return to Earth, lest their secret be revealed. <br /> <br />The Tok'Ra Part 2 - As the last episode ended, the Stargate team was being held by the Tok'Rato keep their secrets safe. Captain Clark had just received word that her dying father was nearing his end. This gives rise to an idea which may just save his life and cement the alliance. Tok'Ra and ghouls both heal their hosts. The former is a mutual symbiote and the latter is the parasite but both heal the body of the host. With that option before them, their lies hope for the Captain, her father, the alliance and the war against the Ghouls. They just have to get it done before the ghoul invasion ships arrive. <br /> <br />Spirits - The SG4 team is overdue back from a planet where they were supposed to be mining a special mineral for use in war against the ghouls and the SG1 team is dispatched to find out what's going on. They find a Native American culture which seems exceedingly friendly but adverse to the idea of mining their mountains. When asked about the missing team, the locals tell them that they are \\"with the spirits.\\" Fortunately, this does not mean they are dead. They literally mean with their spirits. These take the form of wolves, ravens and others to be expected in a Native American culture but there is more to these spirits than meets the eye. They are not who they seem and they are very powerful. They also don't behave well when some of them are brought back through the star gate. <br /> <br />Touchstone - Some time back, the Stargate Command encountered a piece of technology used to control the weather on another planet. A little free time gives SG1 an opportunity to go back to that planet and try and study the device. When they get there, they find a chilly reception from the natives who believe that SG1 stole the \\"touchstone\\" device. It seems that people dressed like stargate teams came through and took the device. As a result, the planet is freezing. The SG1 teams tries to investigate this strange happening but they hit a brick wall in their investigation. Then it turns out that politics are involved and that the Antarctic gate has turned upmissing. The rest of the mission takes place on earth as competing agendas come to light. <br /> <br />A Matter of Time - As one of the Stargate teams tries to flee back through the gate to safety on earth, something goes terribly wrong. They never make it through and the people earthside have a hard time figuring out why they do not and an even harder time figuring why the gate will not close. Then they start to notice strange things. Everything near the gate seems to slow down. When they finally get an image, they see that the planet where the far gate is located is too near a black hole and time dilation has become a factor. Time is slowing down near the hole. This is a problem because the gravitational field of the black hole is being transmitted through the gate to earth. That is why the gate will not close. Time dilation is starting to affect things on this side as well. This is a good episode if your knowledge of physics is particularly weak. That is true of most but especially in this one. Still, it is a good story. <br /> <br />The Fifth Race - When Daniel Jackson is working on deciphering the writing, found in one of their explorations, he finds evidence of another advanced race. When the team goes to investigate further, they find themselves in a high tech but abandoned facility. The colonel inadvertently activates some sort of ray and is knocked out. He seems none the worse for wear at first but he starts adding bits of a strange language to his speech. As time progresses, he speaks more and more in the new language and begins to loose the ability to speak in his own. As a partial compensation, he becomes a genius. He also feels compelled to build strange objects that nobody, including the colonel himself, understands. Eventually, he jury rigs the gate to transport himself to a destination much further than any they have ever traveled to before. When he goes through, he encounters the race of Thor and learns...much. <br /> <br />Serpent's Song - StargateCommand gets what seems to be a communication from the Tok'Ra and SG1 heads out to meet them at the assigned coordinates. Instead of finding the Tok'Ra, they find something very different. A ghoul ship crashes near them. It crashes because it is being chased by more ghoul ships and they are firing on it. When the team looks for survivors, they are surprised to find Apothis, their arch enemy. He is dying and seeks asylum. He wants a new host and offers knowledge. It is a tempting offer but the temptations diminish when it is learned that Apothis is wanted by a much more powerful ghoul who wants him as a prisoner for torture and retribution. Things get difficult because of the human moral code. It does not seem right to hand over even the most despised enemy for a fate like that but humanity's survival may dictate that they do just that. <br /> <br />Holiday - The SG1 team visits a new planet and finds lots of high tech goodies and a single, doddering old man. Teal'c recognizes the old man as a long time enemy of the ghouls who has in his time caused them much trouble before being captured, tortured and escaping. Now, he seems a harmless old man until he and Daniel both touch one of the devices at the same time. Doing so makes Daniel act strangely and the old man loses consciousness. They all evacuate through the stargate and all seems strange except for Daniel being exhausted. The old man doesn't get a say since he is still out of it. Daniel is taken home to get some rest and all seems well. When the old man comes to, everyone is in for a surprise. He is Daniel. Their minds have switched bodies. While search teams are sent into town to retrieve the body of Daniel, Teal'c and the colonel go back to the planet to retrieve the mind transference device. While doing so, those two get switched. This leads to some laughs as the colonel acts the straight man and Teal'c gets to play it up for laughs. When they finally capture the alien with Daniel's body, he is not willing to switch back. He figures that he has given enough to fight the ghouls and that humanity owes him a new life. <br /> <br />One False Step - The SG1 team investigate a pretty amazing planet. It is amazing primarily because its humanoid inhabitants DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. Based on the progress of the series thus far, such places are rare in the universe. The natives of this planet are fairly primitive and seem to have very little in the way of vocal skill. Not long after the team arrives, the natives start dropping like flies. There are all sorts of theories explaining this involving the transmission of disease. A cut finger here, a sneeze there and the like... Things get more frightening for the team when some of its own members start to feel ill but their symptoms are different and the epidemiology does not seem to work out for it having a common source even after alien physiologies are taken into account. The real cause of both diseases is fairly unexpected when it is discovered. This is not the best episode by far but it is refreshing to find one that doesn't depend on English as a universal language. <br /> <br />Show and Tell - Stargate Command is startled when their gate is activated by parties unknown and then, somehow, their iris defense is bypassed. When the intruder finally comes through, they are even more startled to find that he is a human child. The child bears a warning. Members of his \\"mother's\\" species, extremely non human, want to eradicate humanity and all other species that can serve has hosts for the ghouls. Later, it is learned that a member of that same species who issued the warning has come through the Stargate weeks before. They are going to be tough to defend against because they are invisible. The help of the Tok'ra are needed. This is a good episode even though it plays even more loosely than normal with modern physics. <br /> <br />1969 - Sooner or later, it seems as if every Sci-Fi series has to make a try at the grandfather paradox and try the idea of time travel. SG1 got to that point with this episode. The team accidentally goes back to 1969 and are arrested by the military. They manage to escape and must find their way to the stargate and get home. Explaining this episode further would be fruitless but ponder the implications of the SG1 team posing as hippies on their way to Woodstock. Ponder it especially with Teal'c in mind. <br /> <br />Out of Mind - End of season means retrospective time. This episode opens up with Col. O'Neill being revived from suspended animation. He has been out for over 70 years. He is told that he came through the stargate in a state of frozen, suspended animation. The rest of his crew came through dead. It is only now that the technology has been developed to safely revive him. Everyone wants to know, however, what happened. They use some sort of mind probe to play back his memories and we have the \\"benefit\\" of watching portions of previous episodes. The problem is that things are not as they seem. The others are alive and they too are being revived and having their memories probed. This means more flashbacks. The actual situation is even more complex. Teal'c is the only one not to find himself in this strange situation. He is at SGC and time has not progressed. Everyone wants to know what's going on. Hathor knows. Besides being a retrospective, this is also the end of season cliffhanger.  <br />
B00003CX97|5.0|Richly deserving its 1957 \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Award, \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" is truly one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen (and I had never seen it even once until just a few days before writing this review).<br /><br />Directed expertly by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel, \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" never falters. From the very first well-composed \\"CinemaScope\\" frame, right through to its exciting climax, everything about this motion picture is spot-on perfect.<br /><br />The film tells the World War 2 story of a group of British P.O.W.s who are handed the assignment of constructing a railway bridge across the Kwai river, deep within an Asian jungle in the hot and steamy summer of 1943.<br /><br />Each actor in this movie shines brightly in his respective part -- beginning with Alec Guinness' absolutely wonderful award-winning portrayal of \\"Colonel Nicholson\\", who undergoes more than his fair share of torture and abuse at the hands of the Japanese \\"Colonel Saito\\" (played by Sessue Hayakawa). Guinness' Nicholson is a man guided by an immovable set of rigged principles. And he ends up winning his battle of nerves (and torture) against his Japanese enemy. A truly remarkable performance by Mr. Guinness. It's no wonder he was nominated for the \\"Best Actor\\" Oscar for his role in this film. And, rightfully so, he won the award as well.<br /><br />The great William Holden (age 38 here) earned a healthy 1-million-dollar salary for his part as \\"Shears\\" in the movie (plus he got a portion of the film's box-office receipts too). And he earned every cent, as far as I'm concerned. While his part is not quite as deeply-layered or extensive as Alec Guinness' in the picture, Holden's character is still a vital and integral part of the film, as he plays a soldier who sets out on a mission to destroy the River Kwai bridge.<br /><br />Jack Hawkins rounds out the main cast, as \\"Major Warden\\", the hard-nosed leader of the Allied Commando team assigned to blow up the just-finished Kwai railway bridge.<br /><br />An interesting thing hit me a day after I finished watching this movie for the first time -- I found myself re-living portions of the film over again in my head, and (of course) found myself whistling the unforgettably-sensational \\"River Kwai March\\" theme tune (aka \\"Colonel Bogey March\\"), which is something that's likely to stay with you for quite a long time. (The DVD Menus make sure you won't forget the melody either.)<br /><br />Plus, the day after I saw it, I also found myself already beginning to appreciate the \\"timelessness\\" and award-winning flavor and grandeur of this epic-scale motion picture. And I even felt a strong desire to watch the whole 162-minute film all over again the very next day. When a movie can have that much impact on a viewer, what better compliment can there be to emphasize its greatness?<br /><br />Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the 2-Disc edition of \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" on November 21, 2000, and it's a great-looking DVD in all respects, in my opinion. Sporting a beautiful and colorful Anamorphic Widescreen print of the film, Disc One of this two-disc set contains the full-length film in its original CinemaScope aspect ratio of approximately 2.55:1. The lush quality of the photography shines through brilliantly here via this nice, crisp-looking Widescreen version. I'd hate to think of having to watch this movie in a hacked-to-pieces Pan-&-Scan Full-Screen version. Luckily, such torture is not required here, because the original Widescreen format is available on this DVD.<br /><br />There are multiple Dolby Digital soundtracks to choose from for the movie -- a 5.1 Surround track plus a 2.0 Surround option as well. Both of these tracks sound very good to me. Lots of subtitling options are available as well, plus an \\"Isolated Music Score\\" soundtrack too.<br /><br />Several fulfilling bonus features take up residence on Disc #2, including a nicely-done 53-minuteMaking-Of documentary, as well as an original 1950s-era vintage behind-the-cameras featurette (\\"The Rise And Fall Of A Jungle Giant\\"), which has a satisfying old-time \\"nostalgic\\" feel to it.<br /><br />While I very much enjoyed the \\"Jungle Giant\\" mini-featurette (which lasts for a little more than 6 minutes) for its unique behind-the-scenes type of footage -- I couldn't help but scratch my head in bewilderment when the final portion of the program seemingly is cut off abruptly without explanation. The narration and video build the viewer's suspense, taking us right up to the brink of the dramatic one-take-only scene of the bridge being blown to bits, then there's a splice in the film just prior to seeing any behind-the-scenes stuff of the actual detonation, with the film then trailing off into its closing few seconds (an \\"epilogue\\" of sorts). Very odd I thought. Makes me wonder if that bridge-blowing sequence was somehow lost and not able to be recovered for some reason.<br /><br />Additional DVD Extras --- A \\"USC Short Film\\" (with an introduction by William Holden), which runs for just under 16 minutes. This is a kind of a \\"lesson\\" in filmmaking techniques, with \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" used as an example of what goes into feature filmmaking. Lots of behind-the-scenes footage on the sets of \\"Kwai\\" is included here.<br /><br />Another featurette on Disc 2 is \\"An Appreciation By Filmmaker John Milius\\". This is an 8-minute \\"appreciation\\" of \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" by Mr. Milius, as he provides his personal thoughts on the film and its impact on him. Needless to say, he loves the movie. And his comments here are quite interesting too.<br /><br />There are also four Theatrical Trailers included as DVD bonus material (including one for \\"River Kwai\\"). Plus -- A 7-minute \\"Photo Montage\\" (on a musically-scored timed track, with \\"Pause\\" capability enabled). The \\"montage\\" was a slight disappointment to this writer, simply because it only includes photos of poster art and advertising materials for the film. No \\"publicity stills\\" are included at all. Which is kind of odd because a few such items are seen within the Making-Of documentary. Still, the filmed montage is done very nicely, with appropriate underscoring to add atmosphere.<br /><br />Rounding out this healthy batch of DVD supplements is a \\"Talent Files\\" section, featuring brief text-only bios on five members of the \\"Kwai\\" cast and crew.<br /><br />Also included as part of the 2-Disc \\"Limited Edition\\" DVD package is a collectible 12-page booklet, which is a replica (reprint) of the original 1957 souvenir book.

B00005JOIF|4.0|After the horrific slaying of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany by a group of Palestinian nationalists, the Israeli government decided to get revenge.  The ordeal was insulting.  The world watched as 11 innocent men were killed.  So the government asked a man named Avner (Eric Bana), a government agent, to hunt down and kill the members of Black September, the Palestinian group that carried out the Munich attack.  Along with four other operatives (played by Daniel Craig, Ciarn Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler), Avner \\"ceased to exist\\" and was given the funds to wipe out Black September.  Forced to leave his wife and unborn child, Avner and his team went from Israel to Western Europe to hunt down and kill the Palestinians.  Using the aid Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a French citizen who represented a group opposed to government (I'm not sure if it's fair to call them anarchists, though), they begin finding the Palestinians.  According to the Israeli government, the preferred method of execution is explosion, so the team stages operations to rig bombs in the homes/hotel rooms of the targets, and one by one, Black September finds tehir operatives being blown up. <br />But how long can the team keep it up before repurcussions begin to occur?  How long before Black September starts to come after them?  How long until the U.S. government gets wind of the operation?  And how long until paranoia and fear begins to drive the team insane?   <br />Munich successfully shows us the team as neither heroes nor villains.  They are merely caught up in a holy war between to peoples, with neither side being right and neither side feeling as if they have no other choice.  This is a very different film from most of Spielberg's work, but it is highly reccomended for most people.  It is not something to be taken lightly, and is definitely not for everyone.  But it is one of the best movies of the year.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|<br />- Too much filler.  \\"Evening sun\\" and \\"Fear of sleep\\" could've easily been left out of the album, they both have HORRIBLE lyrics. <br /> <br />- No climactic choruses like in hits like \\"Hard to explain\\", \\"Reptilia\\", etc..., instead we're left with choruses with Julian just slowly moaning the title of the song.  For example, \\"Heart in a Cage\\" could've used a loud yelling chorus and \\"On the Other Side\\" could've used something a lot less boring and repetitive. <br /> <br />- Boring slow songs.  \\"Ask me anything\\" and \\"15 minutes\\" are 2 of the most boring songs ever made.  If I wanted to hear slow boring songs I would listen to crap like Coldplay. <br /> <br />- No distorted vocals (they were a good thing), and hardly any yelling. <br /> <br />- The first 5 songs and \\"Red Light\\" are the only songs that stand out on the album mostly since they are most alike to the stuff on their first two albums.  Before on the other albums, almost every single song stood out on its own. <br /> <br /> <br />And sure, people say that if you listen to this album enough it'll grow on you.  Well I could say the same thing about rap, and it would be true.  But who wants to listen to rap???? <br /> <br />I only recommend this CD if you have heard the other 2 albums first, otherwise don't buy it.
1851774408|5.0|This book is worth more than it sales for.  This book, Nineteenth-Century Fashion in Detail, is one of the best fashion books yet.  This book can also be used in the class room and in the sewing and fashion library.  The photographs are done with great percision and shows every detail better than the eye can.  This book also shows that our society no longer appreciate the great pains the old master took back in the old days.  These were the days that people appreciated the chime of a grand father clock, beautiful piano music, fine parfume, and fine fashions.

Some of the insights about humans, how they think, how they interact and how they make mistakes are downright scary.  Unfortunately, I am left wondering what to do about it.  If people make judgments in 2 seconds then how do I prepare for my next job interview?  when should I work hard to overcome my gut feel about something and when should I just trust it?  How would I do it anyway?...    There is not a person whose life is not affected, on a daily basis -- both on the receiving and giving end -- by the phenomena described by Gladwell.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith plays a robot-hating policeman in Chicago in the future.  He not only does not like robots but he doesn't trust them either.  But then a suicide at US Robotics gets him involved in a case that involves a strange robot.  Smith is convinced that the suicide was actually a murder and the strange robot is guilty. <br /> <br />Smith has a hard time getting anyone on the force or at US Robotics to listen to him.  Plenty of action and a pretty well laid out plot move Smith to his final confrontations with the robots and his own feelings for them. <br /> <br />Based loosely on a series of short stories in the collection I, ROBOT by Isaac Asimov, fans of the rest of his work will see that some of the later Robot novel ideas also come into play.  There are also shadowings of Jack Williamson's HUMANOIDS.  This movie was better than I expected it to be based on the action-driven previews.  All in all it was quite entertaining and relatively true to Asimov's robot stories.
B000062YAY|5.0|Slayer are indisputably one of the best ever live heavy metal bands, and, after dominating the thrash circuit for most of the 1980's and the early part of the Nineties, Slayer released their first live album. Unlike many live discs at the time, \\"Decade of Aggression,\\" which was recorded on the band's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" tour, features no overdubs or other studio repairs. But, even still, the difference between these live songs and the studio versions is always very small, and sometimes these live songs are indistinguishable from the originals. Since this album is 100% pure, all live material, it's a great testament to the band's superb and awe-inspiring musicianship. Guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman play as fast as a NASCAR racer and as technical as a heart surgeon. They rip through your speakers and tear through every song with smoldering, fret-board smoking riffs and wild solos, making \\"DoA\\" the most energetic and scorching album I've ever heard. Plus screamer Tom Araya's vocals are usually in top form, here, and drummer Dave Lombardo may struggle to keep up with the rest of the band during \\"War Ensemble\\" and \\"Angel of Death,\\" but his playing is usually great and very precise, as well (see \\"Chemical Warfare\\"). Slayer just push the pedal to the metal and, save for a couple of mid-tempo numbers (i.e. \\"South of Heaven\\"), don't let up for the duration of both discs (which combine a total of almost ninety minutes in length). Every famous Slayer song, from 1991 and before, is covered over the course of these 21 tracks (i.e. \\"Raining Blood,\\" \\"Jesus Saves,\\" \\"Dead Skin Mask,\\" \\"Angel of Death,\\" \\"Chemical Warfare,\\" etc). The first disc, which was entirely recorded at the Lakeland Coliseum in Florida, begins with \\"Hell Awaits.\\" Both guitarists begin playing moderately fast, chugging riffs, before changing gears and launching, full blast, into breakneck guitar riffs. Other highlights (on the first disc) include the careening \\"War Ensemble\\" (which begins with Tom lecturing the mosh pit on \\"helping each other out\\"), the blistering \\"Altar of Sacrifice,\\" \\"Jesus Saves\\" (which races by so fast, you barely hear any actual notes-just a flash flood of guitar noise), and the five back-to-back guitar solos on \\"Angel of Death.\\" Standout tracks on the second disc (which was mostly recorded in California) are the heavy, pounding \\"Hallowed Point,\\" the blindingly fast \\"Captor of Sin,\\" the chug and churning \\"Postmortem,\\" and \\"Spirit In Black,\\" which is brutal and almost out of control. \\"Decade of Aggression\\" is a great, viscous album (probably the best live speed metal album ever recorded), and an essential inclusion in your Slayer collection. Plus, since the live versions of the songs on this album are about as good as the studio cuts, and since \\"Decade of Aggression\\" has a greatest hits track listing, this is also a great place to start if you're new to Slayer.uring the mosh pit on \\"helping each other out\\"), the blistering \\"Altar of Sacrifice,\\" \\"Jesus Saves\\" (which races by so fast, you barely hear any actual notes-just a flash flood of guitar noise), and the five back-to-back guitar solos on \\"Angel of Death.\\" Standout tracks on the second disc (which was mostly recorded in California) are the heavy, pounding \\"Hallowed Point,\\" the blindingly fast \\"Captor of Sin,\\" the chug and churning \\"Postmortem,\\" and \\"Spirit In Black,\\" which is brutal and almost out of control. \\"Decade of Aggression\\" is a great, viscous album (probably the best live speed metal album ever recorded), and an essential inclusion in your Slayer collection.

B0006399FS|3.0|SAFE - That's what this CD is and that's what U2 has become. HTDAAB is designed (intentionally or unintentionally) to soothe the static tastes of older U2 fans that long for that \\"classic\\" U2 sound. Afterall this is U2's supposed return to their rock roots. It's also designed to appeal to the tastes of younger listeners, teens stuck in a bubble gum pop rut, brainwashed by commercialized music. U2 has succeeded in consolidating most of their aging, core fanbase and roped in some newer followers as well. But what they've failed to do is push the creative barrier, the musical envelope so to speak. This trend of releasing banal albums (the other being the preceeding All That You Can't Leave Behind) will ultimately lead U2 down the road of rock has-beens: irrelevant, crowd pleasing human jukeboxes, churning out old hits and recycled sounding \\"new\\" material ala The Rolling Stones. Where's the artistry? The Creativity? Where's the ROCK? After a year of listening to this album I can tell you that it only kinda sorta rocks. It's tepid sounding music, blande and too accessible. The listener doesn't have to work to appreciate the music. Another reviewer stated that the rhythm section has been nuetered. That's true in a way. The bass and drums have been left in the wings, to play conventionally and very forgettably. I know it's unfair to expect a musically ground breaking album each time out, but we could at least expect a very good album. This album is merely OK, in a couple years it will gather dust and be ditched in favor of POP and Zooropa.

It kind of puts you in a trance.  I think he's amazing!  I'm editing this to say that as of this date, 3 weeks later, I'm still addicted.  This has never happened before.  Sure I love the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Sting but no to this extent where I don't listen to the radio anymore.  It's got to stop soon.

Anyway, this movie is somewhat dull, but I just watch it for Alba. There are some stunning shots of her and she is AMAZINGLY beautiful! I loved how many good camera shots there were of her and her gorgeous body. So if you are a guy, I highly reccommend this movie to you. Heck, who whouldn't want to see Alba in a bikini for almost two hours?

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Considering the enormous disadvantage, `Cube Zero' did a fairly good job of being enjoyable Sci-fi thriller. Though the fact doesn't change that the truly innovative Cube is only the first one, `Cube Zero' is not as bad as the terrible `Cube 2.' <br /> <br />The basic premise of `Cube Zero', prequel to the first one, remains the same, but the difference becomes clear to us soon as the film begins. That is, the traps and deaths have become nastier than the two others, as you see the demise of the first \\"subject.\\" Actually, it is probably the nastiest death you ever see in the `Cube' trilogy. <br /> <br />Another difference is a more substantial one. In `Cube Zero,' a young computer operator Wynn (Zachary Bennett, who looks like young Charlie Sheen) records and monitors the deaths in the deadly cubes with his partner Dodd in the dark control room. They receive orders from the higher authority, never questioning what they are doing, until Wynn is interested in one female Cassandra in the cube, and finds that there is no consent form signed by her. <br /> <br />[SILLY BUT ENTERTAINING] Consent form? Are you serious? `Cube Zero' makes such a misstep as that every fifteen minutes, but the film provides as many good (but slightly silly) ideas, and as a result the ride is fairly enjoyable. There is no claustrophobic atmosphere or the insightful observations about the human nature that you found in the original. `Cube Zero' is a kind of dead-or-alive game (especially in the second half). <br /> <br />What is remarkable about the film is the production designs of the cubic rooms and the monitor room. The cubes, which must be one-generation earlier than that of the original film, is made with rougher workmanship, and the deadly traps are more unsophisticated (which means more pains to the victims). The mishmash designs of the monitor room are better than the cubes themselves, and the incongruous combination of the state-of-the-art computer with grey old filing cabinets is a nice idea.  <br /> <br />But still there are many bad things in it, and they are really bad. The acting from the principal characters is acceptable, if not great. But the worst is the bureaucratic section which is represented by the characters in suit. When they appear, the film suddenly (and unwittingly) becomes a unfunny comedy, and one irritating character Jax with plastic eye virtually ruins the film, swinging a stick, speaking like a magician hired for a child's birthday party. And the ending that is supposed to connect to the first `Cube' looks simply a forced one. <br /> <br /> Still I enjoyed it as mindless fun, as so-so B-thriller with some scares and gores. Not as great as `Cube,' but far better than `Cube 2.'
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This is an unusual film in that it's a slow-paced suspense movie.   <br />The scenery is pretty, and so is the music.  It's a mellow thriller.  Worked for me. <br /> <br />The relationship between the diplomat and the activist is interesting and used to convey the tension between different views of progress.  His is about order, about cultivating and perfecting the structures of civilization (a gardener, after all).  Hers is about activism, revolution, and face-to-face intervention on behalf of the needy.  In each their own way, they are idealists and they nurture and respect each other as such.  He admires her courage and passion; she admires his discipline and sensitivity.  He tends towards being aloof, she towards recklessness, and each is punished as the story progresses.  Little domestic scenes, e.g. one where she tells him he's the type who would  \\"buy the angry mob fish and chips while waiting for law and order to return\\", are acted out very well.   <br /> <br />The suspense in the film builds steadily as you wonder what it was she was investigating, whether her suspicions were correct, whether she was unfaithful to him/who the father of her child is, whether he will believe she was unfaithful, whether he can figure out who killed her, what he can do to make the perpetrators accountable, and what happens to him next.  The film gives you time to ponder these things - none of the above questions are stated with very much urgency - and it's nice to have a plot that isn't just about One Big Mystery. <br /> <br />One weakness of the film is that although it is purportedly about Africa, there are hardly any Africans in it.  There's an African doctor, but his character isn't developed very well at all.  In general, the Africans are portrayed as very passive: as recipients of medical aid, as servants and gardeners who need instruction, as victims of corporate exploitation, as corrupt officials easily cowed by stern, white envoys.  Et cetera. <br /> <br />Granted, there's mention of an African activist that Tessa wants to travel to meet and a brief scene depicting a local theatre group doing AIDS education, but they're both very much in the background.  I'm not pedantic enough to go back with a stopwatch and check, but I'm pretty sure the scenes of flamingos in flight are longer than the ones of grassroots efforts by African people on their own behalf. <br /> <br />So although the story is interesting, the acting good, and the African setting beautifully filmed, there's no escaping that this is solidly a movie about Europeans, and not about Africa.
B000A78Z82|1.0|\\"With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. \\" <br /> <br />\\"Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.\\" <br /> <br />It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|ever have one of those shows that you watch and you immediatly want to watch it again and again and know most everything you can about it _and_ want to meet people just like you?  well, this is the one to get hooked on.  i remember firefly back in 2002 when it first aired and despite fox's neglegence turns promotions and basic airing the episodes in order, firefly managed to get a strong, loyal, and broad fanbase that has supported everybody from cast, to crew, to each other, and donating to charities in the name of the show. <br /> <br />firefly is a sci-fi action adventure comedy western set in space five-hundred years in the future after a galactic civil war where prostitution is not only legal, but accepted as one of the highest professions out there.  so, you know, there's millions of shows like that out there(&lt;--sarcasm).  the characters are well-developed dspite the shortlived-ness of the series.  the cast and crew are devoted and fun to talk to, which does happen regularly on the official firefly forums ([...]) and whedonesque.com. <br /> <br />you don't have to be a fan of westerns or sci-fi to be a fan of the show.  i wasn't.
0375751513|5.0|Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.<br /><br />Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)
0880796863|1.0|Drawing upon my experience as a graphic designer and my familiarity with various paper stocks and printing processes, I would have to rate the quality of this repro as very poor. The printing of it is, in a word, atrocious. The color on many of the cards fills in and obliterates many of the details within the illustrated figures. The very worst example of this occurs within the King of Pentacles. The card is shockingly bad in that nearly all of the detail is gone filled in by a muddy black. I was so very disappointed with this that I purchased shortly after the Universal Waite Tarot Deck. This deck uses the very same imagery as the first but colors the cards differently. Whereas the repro unsuccessfully used flat color, the Universal Waite employs shading, graduated color fills, and shading/modeling of the figures. All to great effect. None of the original detail of the cards is lost. The only issue I have with this deck is that it's too pretty. The solution, as I see it, would be to use flat color but to  do so in a way that does not fill in or obliterate card details. The attention to detail in the Universal Waite is commendable and makes for a pleasing, if a bit distracting, deck. If the repro could have preserved the internal details of the cards, as did the Universal Waite, while still employing flat color fields - it would have been my preferred deck. As it stands, I shall use each, depending upon my mood, as it is not so much how the cards look that is important, but rather what it is they say. I will, of course, continue to see if the 'ideal' is manufactured by anyone else.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|A much more varied album than their previous (Transatlanticism) DCFC's Plans is a mixture of lighthearted breezy songs(crooked teeth) and ballads (i'll follow you into the dark). I can listen to this entire album without stopping, and thats saying something. Their hit single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" doesn't falter in giving you a musical experience. If you were a little iffy on their last album, but liked their style, I would not hesitate in buying this album. Their styly in music doesnt really change, it's just more enhanced, and their songs dont all seem to last 5 hours like on Transatlanticism. But there are some long moody songs (What Sarah Said) just to show you that they haven't lost their signature style. It's a great album to write and paint to, and I reccommend it to any iffy DCFC fans.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This CD is fantastic, and in my opinion, the best work The Strokes have put out.  It is more mellow than their other records, but the songs are far from boring.  It is rare for all the songs to be good on a 14 song album, but \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" comes very close, featuring only one or two weak tracks.  Every time I listen to this album, a new song jumps out at me.  I have like 7 favorites!

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|I've liked what I've heard from streaming this CD online, but I know RCA has added copyright protection to CDs in the past (for example King's of Leon) that do not allow the CDs to be ripped to MP3 for portable devices.  I like to listen in my car (via CD) and on my Nomad MP3 player.  Does anyone know if CD has the same protections?  If so, I'll just skip it.
B00005JO9J|5.0|You have to watch \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" to understand how great this tv show is. If not, you're missing out. \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", I think, is the best show on tv right now. You know it's a great show when you don't want it to end.    Love all the characters!
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|After a near-perfect debut album, Is This It, and a just-as-catchy follow-up, Room On Fire, First Impressions of Earth introduces us to a more mature and musically diverse band.    Yes, the New York quintent's signature catchy melodies and jangly guitars are there, as is a bit of the 80s new wave vibe from Room on Fire. However, First Impressions shows the band varying their sound and exploring different grounds. Julian Casablancas is finally front and center, not lost in the low-fi sound of the previous albums. Drummer Fab Moretti is a machine. Guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. perfectly synchronize. Bassist Nikolai Fraiture is there, but unfortunately, his grooving bass lines are somewhat buried under the over-production.    This third album gives us a more melodic and mellow band, but the pop/rock appeal is still there. Stand out tracks include \\"You Only Live Once\\", \\"Juicebox\\", \\"Razorblade\\", \\"On the Other Side\\", and \\"Red Light\\". \\"Red Light\\" in particular is a joy as it is an upbeat pop-synth tune which is reminiscent of the best moments from Room On Fire.    If you are a Strokes fan, you'll be impressed by the band's maturing sound and diversity, though it may be a bit of a surprise how they've grown. If you are a music fan looking for something different in rock 'n roll, you'll be pleased with the melody-driven tunes that don't rely on screaming or angsty lyrics.

Let's admit it males and females, he is quite possibly the sexiest man that ever lived. He was also an incredible singer who knew how to put emotion in every word. Some of the sings here, while never were played on MTV(Which Sucks) are instantly recognizable as classics in music history: \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" \\"Dont Be Cruel\\" \\"Hound Dog\\" \\"Too Much\\" \\"Burning Love\\" etc... <br /> <br />Long live the king, long live MTV.

B00005JO1P|4.0|Aside from \\"Boy named Sue,\\" \\"Ring of Fire\\" and a couple other classic hits, I'm not much of a Johnny Cash fan. Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness. Bottom line: for a guy who didn't bring much fan loyalty into \\"Walk The Line,\\" Cash's film biography, I found it tolerable.<br /><br />WTL takes us from Cash's dirt-poor Arkansas roots, where a family accident left him, the ill-favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage. In the Air Force, Cash started writing the songs (though from what impulse the film does not say) that later made him famous. Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter. The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years. The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.<br /><br />ALERT! A few spoilers in this paragraph: WTL is chock full of clich&eacute;s about making it in the arts: the intrepid hero who battles self-doubt, family antagonism and an industry that doesn't think he has what it takes; with guts and desire he masters his instrument and becomes a great success, only to lose his way in anonymous sex, pills, booze or dope; After hitting bottom, the love of friends and family help him face the demons of the past, get him cleaned up and move onto greater successes. WTL, like \\"Ray,\\" mines these familiar veins.<br /><br />WTL is saved from mediocrity by a couple of factors. Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash. Sometimes he looks and acts very much like Cash, other times less so. It's hard, though to know whether he's playing a man who is painfully shy and not good with words, or one who is not that bright. Reese Witherspoon does a creditable job as June Carter Cash, though every now and then \\"Legally Blonde\\" peeks through. What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts. With Johnny Cash, pure determination took over when all else failed. The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.<br /><br />If it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.e Carter Cash, though every now and then \\"Legally Blonde\\" peeks through.

B000BRBA8S|5.0|2046 is not, as some have suggested, a sequel to WKW's In the Mood for Love.  It does retain the protagonist played by Tony Leung, but 2046 can be viewed as a wholly separate work unto itself.  Christopher Doyle (and others') cinematography is as beautiful as ever, perhaps what makes 2046 most compelling.  It doesn't follow the rules of traditional cinematic narrative structure, even by Wong's standards.  What is gained by eschewing straightforward storytelling is a truly affecting meditation on the paralyzing grip of memory.  A masterpiece of postmodern cinema.
B000002TQV|5.0|for those who are kind of freaked out by the abnormal and unusual sounds of radiohead, this is a great album to have. it's nothing too crazy, but definitely has radiohead sound and thom yorke's unmistakable voice. this is the album that led me to being in love with this band. the albums that follow are a bit off the deep end, but i think once their sound and creativity is appreciated, they can be understood more. myself...i love things off the deep end! this is a great start to those who know little or nothing about the band. it's not their best in my opinion, but they're all superb.
0679720200|2.0|The Stranger, written by absurdist philosopher and (obviously) novelist Albert Camus, is quite unlike any other book you will ever read: but do not mistake this originality for any innate worth. <br />Indeed, if one were to draw worth from this novel, it's that it shows the logical and psychological consequences of accepting the absurdist idealogy, which states that Life is entirely absurd and pointless, and what one does makes no difference at all. The only thing precisely comparable of which I am aware of is, perhaps, Notes From Underground, although there are still many notable differences. Within the framework of this desolate philosophy we are witness to the tale of Meursault. I won't regurgiate the basic plot line here, as the other Amazon reviewers have kindly taken it upon themselves to state it as such from every different angle. <br />The one thing I will vouch for in this book is his use of language. It is clear, cold, objective, and precise; it lacks entirely any notion of passion, desire, or even life. Why then, would I praise it? Because this style allows us to see the world as it is through the clear, dead eyes of Meursault; what we see in the book are his impressions entirely sifted through the filter of his philosophy on life. It's difficult to write prose that is both passionately eloquent and precise, and yet its even more difficult to write something with no passion or beauty at all, yet with a barren eloquence and precision that is the mark of the most disciplined type of mind. The feeling it gives me is the same feeling I have when I read The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles. Hopelessness prevails in this cruel universe of his. I can say that I don't share his universe, but I can certainely empathize with it, for I see it all around me every day. Perhaps there is no better work to show the emptiness that has prevailed in the 20th century. <br /> <br />Why, then, the low score? Because this book has little if no positive worth at all. It's extremely unenjoyable to read, and one isn't able to catch a grain of meaning in this work... although, to be fair, it is a work about the nonexistence of meaning. It does accomplish what it sets out to accomplish, but what is the point of a book like this? Some books record the prevailing feeling of an era and some books wallow in it. This book wallows in the meaninglessness of Meursault's life, with no attempt to rationalize or justify this horrific mindset: why, at the very least Notes From Underground is used to depict what happens when man is abandoned by God, and the author's vision grows to offer a solution to the ailment afflicting all underground men in his later work; indeed, within Karamazov's Alyosha there grows a hope to escape the isolation surrounding the characters and their essential time period. Camus does not see this mindset as an ailment, however. He sees it as the natural state of existence. Now, it's certainely his right to believe whatever he wants and to write about his beliefs, but I can see very little reason to read this novel independently unless you're seeking to read well-written books, regardless of their meaninglessness. <br />A classic indeed, but not all classics are good works of literature.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is an amazing album by Enrique. It is one of his best and  most theatrical works. This is a pop album that really got him a lot of attention, and made him a bigger star then he already was. Escape is one of Enrique's most mainstream records. He scored massive #1's with the songs \\"Hero\\" and \\"Escape\\". \\"Love To See You Cry\\" was another great single, and while sounding very groove still managed to sound very latin. A very smooth track for the album. \\"Maybe\\" was yet another single and a nice ballad. \\"Don't Turn Off The Lights\\" was a great Rock/Pop song and was also a single. \\"Escape\\" itself was one of Iglesias's most popular songs along with \\"Hero\\". It was a great Pop track and got plenty of radio play. Instead of giving info on the singles ( which you've probably all heard already) ill stick to commenting on the non-single songs on the album.  It's not just the great singles from the album that make it an enjoyable listen. There are also non-single tracks on the album that make it fun to listen to. This I believe is part of the key to it's massive success.   \\"Love 4 Fun\\" is one of the albums fun pop tracks and aswell as having a great tune and lyrics it has a great bridge. \\"When you don't have a place to go, and everything feels the same. I can change what you think you know. Makin' Love my way\\".  \\"I'm makin' love for fun. Why would you do it any other way ?\\"  Great song to listen to. very fun and uplifting.  \\"I Will Survive\\" is another fun song off the album. It has a great atmosphere to it, and it is about a girl who has cheated with Enrique, but he know's he will survive.   This song like many on Escape just has a great tune, great lyrics. Great everything. It's a real fun track to listen to.  \\"One Night Stand\\" is a good song. It sounds quite groove with a bit of guitar in it. the lyrics go \\"Now i'm left up in my lonely room. She left her underwear and her perfume. I never thought that it could've felt this good, and I still feel her lips upon my fingertips.\\" The lyrics are quite suggestive, but the song is not to deep, because it has a great tune and beat to it.  \\"If The World Crashes Down\\" is another great sounding song off Escape. It has good guitars in it, another great tune like many of the songs on this album. The lyrics are also uplifting.   \\"You make me strong. You make me weak. You lift me off my feet. You give me hope when all my dreams seem like their out of reach. You make me understand the way the perfect love should be. You take me to a place so high, I never wanna' leave.\\"  This is one of my favourite songs from Escape because it is so uplifting. \\"You Whisper in my ear the words You're so close tonight. Hold me Tonight. and when the pain is holding me, your touch sets me free. Sometimes I think of all the things I should've said. I hope it's not too late. Wanna' make you understand. If the world crashes down over me. I know that my life is complete. Cos' iv'e held you in my arms all night. Cos' I can't imagine life without you by my side\\" There are also some great deep guitar riffs in this song.  \\"She Be The One\\" is another good song. It sounds a little latin, and very cool. It talks about the girls who all the guys want, but there seductive and dangerous. \\"Don't fool yourself. You Can't stop it if you try. She's gonna take you low. She's gonna take you high. never get enough.\\" goes the lyrics.  \\"She hits the club, and everybody watches. and when she dances everybody want's it. The kinda' girl you kinda' gotta watch. She might just get away. She makes you wait. She likes to play that kinda' game. She takes your money. You gladly give it all away. She makes you nasty. Even wanna' feel pain. Then she'll make you born again\\". Great song on a great album.   Escape is a fun record and one of Enrique's best. It delivers some great Pop Music. It is a great listen, and a must own for any music fan. ENRIQUE FANS MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM !!!
B000ASDFJU|1.0|the show sex and the city is a wonderful show. But I am really pissed off that HBO didn't come out with this beautiful giftset until I already bought the cheap plastic crap, for all the seasons. Also if amazon.com is suppose to be cheaper then why is it when I went to TARGET they have the exact new giftset for $189.00 I suggest that you should get the box set but you should buy it from Target.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|i don't know what it is about her, but she seems on my level. this is the first album of fiona's that i'd ever heard. \\"i know\\" is such a powerful song...hard to listen to if you can relate to how she feels. i love the fact that she's not all into glam and fame...she's just a person who's been through a lot of crap and knows how to express it through music. some of the songs are playful and some are painful...it's all hot and sultry because it's fiona. i recommend every album she's put out. they all have a lot of stuff underneath if you really listen. the order i bought her albums in were: when the pawn, tidal, and extraordinary machine. i recommend it to be done that way. i think if i had heard them in a different order, i might have a different opinion.
0684843749|5.0|I could write ten pages on how good this book is, but I'll keep it short.  It's simply the best book on physical fitness that I have ever read.  I won't summarize it any more than that--go to the library or bookstore and look for yourself, you'll understand.   <br /> <br />This book applies to heavy lifters or casual gym-goers.  Just give it a shot, trust me, you will never be sorry for having read this.
0385338686|3.0|I'd rate this book 3 1/2 stars. For the most part, it's a funny, light read -- a good book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon or take on an airplane. Some parts were actually laugh-aloud funny. However, I thought other parts tended to drag and were a bit tedious. In general, this book is worth reading.
B000065BPB|5.0|I recently purchased these headphones, and my God...They are fantastic.  I have never owned a pair of really nice headphones in the past, so maybe my review is a little bit biased...But really, they are unbeliveable.  The bass levels are so high, yet they leave the mid tones and higher sounds crisp and un-destorted.  For the price, these are amazing.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 have struck gold with this album. I have owned it for a long time but it is undoubtedly my favourite album to listen to. I could listen to the vocals endlessly and each song is refreshingly different from any other. All of the songs on the album are worthy number one hits but it's hard with all the manufactured pop and computer generated animals around!
B000002MJ0|4.0|I like the album more than loveless.  Don't get my wrong, loveless is great, but it is very calculated and every song shares the same sort of sound with the dense layers and the voice turned down.  Isn't Anything is pure shoegaze.  This album rocks with funky songs like soft as snow and seven girls galore, to the bleak \\"sueisfine\\" and \\"you never should\\", this is a really great album worthy of its follow-up and worth a listen.
B00005JOFO|1.0|After all the hype about this movie I guess I set my expectations too high. I was expecting \\"an epic love story\\" like the trailers and reviews tout it to be. I don't remember anywhere in the entire film the word \\"love\\" being mentioned. Ennis and Jack certainly never said it... to each other or to their wives or their kids. I was expecting to watch these two guys unexpectedly fall madly, head over heels, kick up your boots, thank your lucky stars in love with each other. What I ended up watching was two drunks get it on `cuz they were horny and didn't have anything else to do between shootin' coyotes and tacklin' sheep. Then they spend the rest of their miserable lives cheating on their wives, abandoning their kids, and arguing about why they should or shouldn't make a life together. Undoubtedly the sense of longing to be together was conveyed, but for what? Love? Sorry, none to be had here. <br /> <br />The only redeeming quality of this film is that the scenery is stunning; however, the acting was average. I never felt emotionally attached to anyone except Michelle Williams's character, Alma. My personal opinion is, if you think you might be gay; don't expect getting married to a woman to fix it. You simply ruin your life, her life and the lives any kids that are created in the process. I left the theater with an extreme sense of emptiness.  <br /> <br />I had hoped that somewhere in this wretched mess that someone would end up with a scrap of happiness. However, the best they could do was to have Alma Jr. to get her daddy to come to her wedding. So much for resolution. <br /> <br />I was told by a friend, \\"Life doesn't always have a happy ending...\\" I'm a gay man in the 21st century; if I want to experience life, I don't think I Ang Lee's help to do it.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|As with SG-1, at first I didn't really care for Atlantis because I didn't get it.  However, after I watched a couple of episodes, I figured it out (the whole wraith bit and how the city of Atlantis could be on a different planet, different galaxy).  I now love the show and think it is better than SG-1 with its S9 cast and plot change.  Besides, Joe Flannigan is HOT!  I never miss an episode, and have added Atlantis' DVDs to my collection.
0060512806|5.0|This is the kind of great novel that, without any pretensions of intellectualism (but an enormous display of intelligence), is both immense in scope, bold in vision, and lightheartedly cool and funny.  No review could convey the range of issues, both mundane and enormous, that are covered in this book.  More than that, no review could convince a reader how enjoyable and laugh out loud hilarious it is in more places than I can count.  I really liked the fact that I could get lost in the novel for a while, put it down for a few weeks, then be absorbed again, and again and again.  One complaint that some have put down here is that it sometimes gets bogged down in details.  That is true; Stephenson has a tendency to digress.  But most of the digressions are fascinating; they sometimes do allow you to lose track of the story, such that when the digression is over you no longer feel the irresistable urge to know what comes next, but I liked that about my experience of reading this novel.  I found that it can't be read in one or two or three sittings.  There's just too much there.  I probably read it in thirty or fourty sittings over the course of about a month; when I'd had enough, I could set it down and do something else, and come back to something new and surprisingly intriguing the next day or week.  Most novels that took that long would lose their grip on me.  Some books that don't lose their grip on me have me staying up all night for a few days.  Somehow with this book the digressions and the interruptions in the story as he moves between the points of view of four or five main characters from different time periods allowed me to walk away and come back comfortably.  I will say that by the last few hundred pages I couldn't put it down, and kept going until it was over.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code isn't a bad book. It has a lot of things going for it, such as an interesting protagonist, lots of twist and turns, and interesting historical information. However, it also has a few very serious problems, including fairly unbelievable depictions of how people would react in the given situations, a few too many \\"close shave\\" getaways, and a villain, who when revealed makes no sense.<br /><br />Now, I am not going to spoil the ending, but a critical look of how it was all \\"done\\" at the end leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Why didn't the \\"villain\\" or \\"villains\\" just do what they are doing in a simpler fashion?  I can't articulate more without ruining the plot, but let's just say that it's akin to many detective shows that use the \\"flashback\\" method to explain the crime, and usually they don't make sense when one reasonably analyzes the flashbacks... Anyhow, it doesn't change the fact that this is a fast paced and easy read. I can certainly see why it appeals to the masses, as it purports to tell a great mystery - and many people likely love the idea of historical conspiracies, especially when told in such a simple writing style. Even I loved the level of bashing of the Catholic Church, and how they treated pagans -like me - throughout history.  I would suggest that you read this book, just don't expect it to be quite as great as many people might set it up to be as the Code is really just another overly complicated crime that needs deciphering...<br /><br />Relic113
B00006FDCJ|5.0|In 1992 Clint Eastwood finally got around to filming Unforgiven, a script for which he had purchased the rights many years earlier. It is a thoughtful, uncompromising look at how violence begets violence; and that the traditional line between the good and evil is not as clear as it appears on the surface. For film buffs impressed by Oscar, the film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, who turns in one of his finest performances as the town sheriff Little Bill.<br /><br />  This tale of retribution begins in a town called Big Whiskey with a drunken cowpoke named Quick Mike slicing up a whore named Delilah's face, after she giggles at size of his male anatomy. When the other prostitutes led by Strawberry Alice (Francis Fischer) go to Little Bill seeking redress, he lets the offending drover and his partner Davey off with a mild punishment that includes the price of a few horses. Incensed at this miscarriage of justice, the women take up a collection to establish a thousand dollar bounty for anyone who will kill the two ranch hands.<br /><br />  Upon hearing of the blood money offered, a fledgling, young gunslinger calling himself The Schofield Kid arrives at the farm of William Munny (Eastwood), who is raising two children without a mother and struggling to make ends meet. The kid informs Munny he is seeking his services as paid assassin. Munny subsequently enlists his former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the trio set off for Big Whiskey to snuff out the unsuspecting cowboys.<br /><br />  During the long ride to their destination, it is poignant foreshadowing when Will reminds Ned of his wild days as remorseless killer. He vividly describes his ruthless killing of an innocent drover that weighs heavy on his conscience. Nevertheless, Munny reflects that his deceased wife forever ended his drunken, murdering ways with Ned reassuring him that, \\"You ain't like that no more\\".<br /><br />  With intelligence supplied by Skinny the Saloon owner, Little Bill discovers that the whores are offering a reward for the two ranch hands. Acting swiftly, he musters his team of deputies and after nearly beating him to death, sends another bounty hunter named English Bob (Richard Harris) packing. When Will and his comrades arrive in town, the sheriff also inflicts a savage beating on him while he is too sick to defend himself. In spite of this setback, the trio manages to kill Mike's friend Davey in a heart wrenching sequence, which is enough to inspire Ned to forfeit his share of the bounty and head home. Unfortunately, Logan is captured and tortured to death by the sadistic Little Bill.<br /><br />  Eastwood the director masterfully demonstrates how unglamorous a killing can be when Schofield shoots Quick Mike while he is using the outhouse. We learn the ultimate irony is that the kid, anxious to prove himself as a bad man, has absolutely no stomach for the taking of a life. Chillingly, it is Will, who after a few swigs of whiskey has no problem transforming back to the precision killing machine of his earlier days. When he discovers that Little Bill has taken Ned's life, Munny slaughters the sheriff, his deputies and the saloon owner who was foolish enough to display Logan's body in front of his establishment.<br /><br />  This film is a masterwork of understanding the complexities of human behavior. Though Will Munny is supposed to be the unforgiving killer, he is the protagonist of the story. In a scene acted with near perfection by Eastwood, he wisely reflects to the kid, \\"It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man. You take away all he's got an' all he's ever gonna have.\\" When Schofield attempts to justify his actions, he suggests to Will, \\"Well I guess they had it comin\\", to which Munny succinctly replies, \\"We all have it comin kid.\\"<br /><br />  Though he represents law and order, Little Bill is clearly the antagonist who blindly believes in his own righteousness. When he is gunned down by Will, he incredulously exclaims, \\"that I don't deserve to die like this\\". Ultimately, it is Munny who has the clearest sense of purpose and in the face of overwhelming odds, remains cool under fire. He teaches Little Bill his last lesson; that deserve has got nothing to do with it.antagonist who blindly believes in his own righteousness.

0140177396|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This novella, by Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck (1902 to 1968), was first published in the world when it was in the grips of the Great (Economic) Depression (that began in 1929 and lasted through most of the 1930s).<br /><br />This dark tale presents a human world that contains jealousy, cruelty, loneliness, rootlessness, poverty, and shattered dreams.  It is a parable about two men, George and Lennie, striving for a better life; who long for self respect, independence, freedom, and work that they enjoy.<br /><br />Lennie is a mentally deficient but a big, strong man who has a childlike innocence and is fascinated with soft things.  George, who travels with him, is his protector.  The only thing that they have is each other.  George explains: \\"I got you to look after me and you got me to look after you.\\"<br /><br />Their dream?  To own their own place and \\"to live off the fatta the lan'.\\"  However, their plan to reach this dream does not work out.  The title of this short novel gives this away.  It's from a phrase in a famous poet's 1785 poem: \\"The best laid schemes o' mice and men [often go awry].\\"<br /><br />I felt that this novel was so balanced and thoughtful in structure that it's a work of art.  However, others may feel that this makes the book predictable.<br /><br />The entire novel contains little narration.  Instead Steinbeck relies on the words and actions of the characters (in which there are seven major ones).  In fact, on examination, I found for each chapter (there are six untitled ones) that most pages (after an initial description of the setting) contain all dialogue with short introductory phrases.<br /><br />This novella is filled with the words of migrant workers and ranch workers of that time period.  Examples include: bindle, cat house, swamper, jailbait, booby hatch, Jackson fork, and jack-pin.  It is not necessary to know the meaning of these words to follow the story but for the curious, I recommend keeping a dictionary nearby.<br /><br />Finally, there is a 1992 movie of the same name that is based on this novel starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.<br /><br />In conclusion, we all have a dream.  This book effectively illustrates how life and fate can alter that dream!!<br /><br />(first published 1937;  6 chapters;  main narrative 105 pages)<br /><br />+++++earby.<br /><br />Finally, there is a 1992 movie of the same name that is based on this novel starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.<br /><br />In conclusion, we all have a dream.

B000AXSN5G|3.0|If this is the third installment of the \\"Harvest\\" trilogy, it is without a doubt the weakest of the three.  \\"Harvest\\" and \\"Harvest Moon\\" blow this one out of the water.  Usually with Neil, his albums grow on me after listening a few times but not this time.   <br /> <br />There are some good songs like the Painter (would fit perfctly on Silver & Gold), No Wonder and the best of the lot, Falling Off the Face of the Earth. There are also some duds like \\"He was the King\\" (way too long and repetitive) and the gagable title track, which sounds like a Greendale reject (it's that bad). I can only hope that I never hear these two songs again.  The rest are nothing special. <br /> <br />If you want a recent Neil Young album, you would be better served by \\"Are you Passionate\\" or \\"Silver & Gold\\" which are superior in my humble opionion.  Prarie Wind will be going back on the shelf for now (with Greendale).
0345457684|4.0|This story was very fast-paced and exciting, I really enjoyed it.  The character reminded me of Philip Marlowe with a little less humor-- lots of integrity, tough, and often in trouble with the law.  The idea of downloading your memories into a new body is an interesting concept, providing nice plot twists.  Morgan touches briefly on the idea of whether your soul is captured in your memories, but mainly skirts the issue-- there isn't much time for introspection in this story.  Definitely a good book, whether you're a sci-fi fan or not.
0684824906|5.0|When I started this book and saw the author's objective, I expected a long slog through five biographies in one. What I got was a marvelous read, illustrating more clearly than typical biographies do the genius of Lincoln, balancing the opposing factions of his party and the opposing characters of the talented men he chose for his political family. I came away with a deeper appreciation of what Lincoln accomplished as well as an understanding of some contemporary scoundrels: Chase, McClellan, Fremont. Truly a deep and informative portrayal of all these men, and better insight than I have seen into the women who supported them. <br />
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I bought my fullscreen DVD at Hollywood video, and it had two Chinese audio options (Mandarin/Cantonese) and English dubbed (hilarious) as well as some Euro language (Probably French).  It should be the same version Amazon is selling...not sure why it wouldnt be.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|Underrated.  The Strokes have put out 3 amazing albums and each one shows a more polished, improved sound.  First Impressions of Earth is amazing from start to finish.  One funny note is that the Strokes have a very vintage sound--even though they get better each time out, each album has a sound quality like it was recorded in your bedroom closet.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I did purchase the dvds when they came out each season and this was really pricey... but I still love it!  To answer the questions about the tributes and alternate endings, it does include the three alternate endings, but they are pretty disappointing. They are short and not what I was expecting.  The two HBO tributes are also included.  I think all the extras are pretty great.  The box is pretty big and does not fit in most dvd cabinets which is frustrating, but I love the layout and the book.  It would be hard to create a book with the pictures and descriptions and still make it small enough to fit with the other dvds.  It has all of the dvds as well as descriptions of each episode in a book with great pictures.  It makes it fun and easy to skim through, find your favorite epidose and play it.  If you like to watch the episodes over and over, it is perfect.  I sold my old dvds on e-bay, which helped with the cost.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|what a beautiful ensemble!  the stand-outs include: \\"river sings\\", \\"long long journey\\", \\"amarantine\\" and \\"drifting\\".  glorious melodies that enchant the spirit!  =)
B000BVD460|4.0|To be honest with you the marshall mathers Lp is better then this album. Sure this is his hits for the radio but for his real fans the marshal mathers lp and the slim shady Lp were his best cds.  Infinite is also a cd that I would say is better then this. <br />The song Kim is eminems best song in my mind because of the emotion he put into it. When Im gone is good but its the same subject matter we have heard on all of him albums.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series, and I would especially recommend it for anyone that believes they do not like science fiction.  My girlfriend hated sci-fi stuff (stereotyped as Star Trek and the like), but I got her to watch one episode of Firefly and now she's hooked.  I found Firefly to be a great way to introduce science fiction elements (space, other worlds...) and still allow her to feel at home, as the plots and themes in the series are extremely recognizable.  If you liked Firefly I would recommend taking a peek at Cowboy Bebop (yes I know it is a cartoon, but some of the shows on TV now should be animated they are so unbelievable).  I found alot of the same elements in Firefly that I did in Cowboy Bebop: great episodes, terrific character development, and dark undertones with a slightly moral main character.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you liked the TV series \\"Firefly\\" that this movie was based upon, you are in for a real surprise with \\"Serenity\\". This film is not just as good as the wrongly cancelled TV show, but even better. I loved \\"Firefly\\" and have no doubt it would have been an excellent show given the time to mature. But I'm obsessed with \\"Serenity\\". This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Even if you haven't seen the series, you will be able to follow \\"Serenity\\" (although I do recommend that you do watch the show before the movie to get the full effect). Joss Whedon makes you love his characters. And the situations he places them into in this movie makes them shine in ways they didn't in the show. The story is marvelous and the various themes Whedon explores are brilliant (themes also seen in Buffy and Angel). This is not just some cheap space sci-fi flick, this movie is EPIC! My wife, who ordinarily does not like these types of films, also loved the show-and was astounded by the movie.  <br /> <br />I just can't stop saying how good this movie really is; you must see it for yourself. There are not enough stars to give it-no exaggeration. You will love this movie! Buy it, rent it or borrow it-do anything to see it. Kudos to Joss Whedon on this monumental and unprecedented achievement! I hope there will be more movies to follow.  <br /> <br />Caesar says two thumbs enthusiastically way up! <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This is not only the best R&B album of the year but a classic R&B piece.  Trust me you will me not be disappointed.

KAnye adds sugar to this sweet track <br /> <br />I can Change - with a gospel seasoned background....JL swoons over changing his cheating ways 4 this lovely lady...Snoop displays a groovy blazing incerpt. <br /> <br />Ordinary People - what else can be said...it is simply elegant...superb even <br /> <br />Stay with you - a lovely sing-along that is cemented with John's sincerity.  It is beautiful and definably beautifully performed <br /> <br />Let's get lifted again - This prelude is sensual...Oozing with raw emotion and sexuality.

Listen closely and john will take you to a place so far...so blazing....so high... <br /> <br />Refuge - My favorite sing-along song on the album.  So sincere, so true, so uplifting, ...John's voice hovers over you wraps you in a warm & cozy blanket <br /> <br />It don't have to change - reminds you of a time long gone...it's like being at a summer bbq..it's 85 degrees outside and the gurls are jumping rope..it feels like simple days by babyface  <br /> <br />Live It Up -  a celebratory conclusion to an emotion filled, hypnotic piece.

B0009S2T0M|3.0|Having heard some very good reviews round the 'net of this Korean flick, had to check it out on dvd! <br /> <br />Although it did not quite live up to all the hype and praise, its a good little revenge flick no doubt, but the much talked about violence is all cartoonish, and the twist was good but not that great, imho. <br /> <br />Interesting movie though, the octopus eating scene is weird for sure, that actor must of being reaaaal hungry that day :-) <br /> <br />Go on, check it out.
B00003CWPL|5.0|When Eraserhead was released on VHS many years ago, I ran out and got a copy post-haste. Having been the only person in my circle that had seen Eraserhead in the theatre prior to video release, I gathered all my friends for a \\"video night\\". Beer and popcorn and David Lynch.<br /><br />Needless to say, one of my friends became physically ill halfway through our viewing, and blamed it squarely on the film.<br /><br />The images and sounds were more than he could stomach, literally.<br /><br />This same friend also became violently ill during a live performance by the Mahavishnu Orchestra.<br /><br />Coincidence? I'm afraid so.<br /><br />Some people cannot handle genius when it is put before them in explicit form.<br /><br />Check it out for yourself!
1932907009|5.0|This how-to book is an amazing combination of useful instruction, vivid examples, and laugh-out-loud insights into how to write a screenplay that will sell. Snyder is a Hollywood veteran who has made millions by mastering the structure -- and the artful flesh -- that make successful movies. Now he shares what he's learned over 20 years in an engaging book that is both witty and wise. I highly recommend it to those who want to break into Hollywood or those who just love movies and want to know what goes into good ones. <br />
B000060P79|3.0|My feelings are definitely split when it comes to this album. On the one hand, only the deaf could deny that the majority of these songs are catchy, on the other hand, only the slightly retarded could claim that Simple Plan have any great musical ability.  <br />Yes people, we've heard these songs done many times before, and dare i say done better by different bands. Simple Plan are the apitomy of poser punk bands, following the very simple plan laid out by Good Charlotte. The truth is i do listen to this album because when you're not really paying attention, it sounds ok. <br />Don't get me wrong, 3 chord songs are nothing new and they can still warrant credibilty when played by the right band. The real problem with this album is not the music (in fact, the music is the albums saving grace), the problem is the lyrics. Reading the lyrics is terrible experience i would not recommend to anyone. Who wrote these songs? The lyrics are so so bad, they're cringe-worthy. They seem to be written from the perspective of a 12 year old. I'm sure you'd love some examples: <br /> <br />\\"I don't wanna grow up and <br />i don't wanna change <br />so you better give up <br />cuz i'm not gonna change <br />i don't wanna grow up\\" <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes this house feels like a prison <br />that i just can't leave behind <br />there's so many rules i got to follow <br />cuz you can't let go\\" <br /> <br />\\"I like to stay up late <br />spend hours on the phone <br />hanging out with all my friends <br />and never being at home\\" <br /> <br />There are more, but i feel embarrassed just repeating them. These lyrics are the worst i have ever read, they're pathetic. They ruin what could have been a half decent album. Of course, if you are 12, then you probably relate with the above examples and should by all means go buy the album because you'll probably enjoy it. <br />3 stars just because i'm a nice guy. <br />  <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|I ALSO WATCHED THIS ON PBS AND CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT.  I WENT TO AMAZON AND ORDERED BOTH THE CD AND DVD. I AM SENDING THE DVD TO MY MOTHER I KNOW SHE WILL LOVE IT.

THEIR VOICES JUST FLOW LIKE THEY WERE MEANT TO GO TOGETHER.  THANKS TO PBS FOR BRINGING THIS INTO OUR LIVES. WE MAY HAVE BAD DAYS SOMETIMES BUT WHEN WE GET HOME AND PUT THIS ON EITHER ON DVD OR OUR CD IT MAKES ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED DISSAPEAR. <br />
0670451495|5.0|The pictures are great!I loved the story. A nice ending.
0064407667|5.0|Ok, I know this review won't apply to very many people, but... <br /> <br />I've read books 2-4 of this series in Spanish, and so far 1/3 of book 7 in Japanese.  I read books 1, 5 and 6 in English purely for enjoyment.  I've found that these books have helped me immensely in expanding my Spanish and Japanese skills.  The vocabulary is on a fairly elementary level, much easier than Harry Potter, but the writing is so good that it doesn't feel like a simplistic children's book, and the books are so engaging that it's not so much of a chore to look up hundreds of words in the dictionary.  The translations I've encountered do a great job of imitating Snicket's writing style in their own language. <br /> <br />In my opinion, there's no better way to get an ingrained feeling for the form, structure and essential vocabulary of a language than by reading a novel or two in that language, and these books are aptly suited for that task.  I just bought the first box set for some Japanese friends of mine who are learning English. <br />It all starts with Book 1.  Enjoy.

Upon further inspection I found that Chaka's various styles of singing are shown off on this Best of CD!!!  She's funky, jazzy, bluesy, pop/rock, and so on!!  I am impressed!  Top songs on this one are Ain't Nobody, Through The Fire, and Something Deep.  Buy it...listen and enjoy!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|To all the chumps out there:  If you think a band of this caliber is \\"in it\\" for the music, you're wrong.  Every band wants to sign to a major label.  Every band of this power wants to sign to a major label.  The bands who don't and claim they far prefer small clubs and indie labels etc. They will never make it, because they're afraid of losing the small base they've already created for the bigger base that's awaiting them.   <br /> <br />Now... In my trip to NY a couple years ago, I was hungry for something new, something like my old school metal mixed with todays metal, and just a dash of hardcore tossed in.  Some big hairy man at this music store said try this.  Gave a listen, been a fan ever since.   <br /> <br />Now take A7X and breakdown what you're really listening to.  Go grab some samples from some of the greatest metal bands of the 80's.  Sounds familiar and alien at the sametime.   <br /> <br />My aging butt has been around the metal world and I've heard a TON of music in my life.  Gates can stand with ANY guitarist, especially lead, that I've EVER heard and this would be Jimmy Page, Dimebag, Kirk Hammet, Kerry King, Dave Murray, etc.  And being a former drummer, TheRev is from another planet.  His drumming alone adds a TON of strength to A7X.  Sort of reminds me of early Lars Ulrich, complexity of Bonham at times, and precision of Neil Peart, throw in the ferocity of Dave Lombardo.   <br /> <br />A7X is balls to the wall awesome.  They're not sellouts, they're captains on the metal ship, soon it will be sailing their own course.  I'm sure that bothers some people, but when they sat down to create their band I'm sure they didn't think of you, rather that at some point you'd be along for the ride.
B000002B30|2.0|I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen long before he became a household name throughout the U.S.A.  I primarily like his earlier works, but have listened to a lot of what he has done over the years.  Missing from this Greatest Hits collection is Tunnel Of Love and One Step Up.  I am sure that their are others but, those two stand out.  This may appeal to someone who is just trying to add some of his music to their collection.  Perhaps, someone who isn't that familiar with him may enjoy this, but this one disappointed me!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently was lent the series from somebody who correctly profiled me as the type that would enjoy the series.  I never got an opprotunity to watch it while it was on the air. <br /> <br />I am deeply saddened that they stopped the series.  It is an amazing story. <br /> <br />I'm not the type to enjoy westerns, but I very much enjoy good sci-fi. <br /> <br />If television execs are reading this, please bring the series back.  As good as Serenity the movie was, I would rather see the in-depth story development of a whole season in multiple episodes that having it compressed into one movie.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I have always been a big fan of this band and when I heard they were going to a major label I was happy for them. But my lord this album is boring. What ever happened to the drummer he's great and he barely even hits a snare on this album. The lyrics in comparison to past work are just awful as well. There used to be an energy to this band that was incredible and that is history. This album just sound like Ben gibbard really likes his own voice and wants to see how many ways he can twist and turn it. Well congrats Ben it sounds awful. Well another band bights the dust at least I can still reminisce with the old records.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I very much enjoyed the movie, however I feel robbed of the development of the story that the television series gives.  From my understanding the movie was a compresesed version of the second season.  I think the television executives didn't give enough time for people to discover the series, I only recently watched the whole thing. <br /> <br />The movie definately had a much bigger budget than each episode, you can tell from the detail.   However I would rather see the the whole second season because the in depth development of the story is what I really enjoy.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Alot has already been said about this Opeth release, and I can only add that if you are already a fan and liked the Blackwater Park album, then Ghost Reveries is a must buy.  It is very reminiscent of that earlier release, and while Ghost Reveries incorporates the lessons learned through their recent, more experimental ventures, it harkens back to that sound which is uniquely Opeth.   <br /> <br />This is Progressive Metal at its best, and I don't think any one song stands out as any better than the rest. Ghost Reveries is a total package, one of the few albums where every song is outstanding.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Watching 1978's SUPERMAN again after all these years, I'm picking up on symbolism I missed when I saw the film as a kid.  Superman is sent to earth by a white-haired, white-dressed glowing Marlon Brando.  He grows up in humble surroundings.  At 18, he leaves home to go to a desolate location to find himself.  \\"Twelve years later,\\" which makes him 30-years-old when he announces himself to the world as a super man.<br />(As Perry White rants, the reporter who gets his first interview will get the most important story since \\"God talked to Moses\\").<br />Little touches, I know, but I thought it was interesting to notice now.<br /><br />Actually, what I always remembered was Gene Hackman's funny performance as Lex Luthor.  The two lines my friends still quote are:<br />\\"It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to move those legs.\\"<br />And, \\"You were followed again...in spite of those cat-like reflexes.\\"<br />The special effects may look dated and the romance part is a bit much for a comicbook movie, but Hackman is hilarious and Luthor's \\"real estate\\" plot is the most inspired criminal enterprise since Auric Goldfinger tried to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox.<br /><br />The extras are great.  Watching the various actresses doing screen tests, you can see how Margot Kidder really nailed the role.  The others were good but the chemistry is there with Reeve and Kidder.<br /><br />Although it's probably lost on young people today, I loved the shot of Clark Kent running up to a phone booth and looking annoyed at the half-booth (anyone born since this movie came out would not remember that phone booths were once big enough for a man to change clothes in).
B00014TJ6Q|1.0|Ok, Let's make things clear I am huge Harrison/Beatles fan who cannot get enough of them.  But honestly, this is one document that just doesn't cut  it.  Talk about awful, pitiful lyrics that have no meaning and sometimes do not make sense.  A lot of songs sound like no effort was put into them or they were improvised or were just there to fill a 10 song album.  Production sounds just like a 1970's disco jam session, Harrison's guitar isn't even showcased at all and his chord progressions sound simple enough for Ringo Starr  to play them after 6 months of lessons.  Skip this and buy \\"all things must pass\\" which is the white album of Harrison.
B00005JKC3|2.0|I remember when I went to see the American version of GODZILLA back in the 90's.  The one with Matthew Broderick.  What a mess.  I asked my friends, \\"How on earth can you screw up making a Godzilla movie?\\"<br /><br />But they did.<br /><br />I was asking the same question when I saw THE HULK.  But the answer came a little easier: the filmmakers wanted to make MORE of the story than there was.  Get into the Hulk's inner child and psychology.  Blah, blah, psycho-blah.<br /><br />We want to see the Hulk throw more tanks.<br /><br />We want to see him foil villians who try to use him for their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />You've got hundreds of comic books and dozens of TV shows to cobble a cool plot from.<br /><br />You blew it.<br /><br />And...that...just...makes me...ANGRY!<br /><br />You killed a movie franchise faster than Joel Schummacher.

Christine enjoys her success after a night's performance of \\"Think of Me\\" and is reunited with a childhood friend who is now the young and dashing Viscount Raoul.   <br /> <br />Old romance flares and new jealousy arises.  Intent on keeping Christine for him self, the Phantom wisks her away through the mirror and into his lair.  There, Christine finds out who has really been tutoring her and she isn't exactly thrilled.   <br /> <br />Being afraid of the monster(though I would hardly call GB's Phantom a monster) below and his control over her, she plans to run away with Raoul who is more than happy to comply.  However, Phantom foils their plan through an Opera that he's written specifically for Christine, the famous \\"Past the Point of no Return\\" in Don Juan Triumphant.  At the end of the song, he confesses to her and they both fall through a trap back down to the underground.  There, he forces her to accept his proposal while poor Raoul, who tried to rescue her but failed, was forced to watch while tied to the gate and a noose around his neck.   <br /> <br />Christine, not having any choice, accepts.  And Phantom, finally being accepted, lets her go with Raoul.  The End. <br /> <br />That's about how the story goes.  However, Raoul isn't exactly all that dashing in the book.  He's rather shy and timid.  And Phantom, aka Erik, is way more deformed and somewhat older.  Emmy does a wonderful job of singing and so does everyone else.  In case you weren't aware of it, everyone besides Minnie Driver really sang in the movie.The music, of course, is amazing and breathtaking at times.  Webber did a great job once again.  The visuals are very believable, although that fog in the cemetary is a bit scetchy.   <br /> <br />Also, along with all the other goofs:   <br />-this is something that really bugs me, don't know why but it does: when Christine takes off Phantom's mask for the first time, his hair is perfectly normal, sleeked back and black.  His face looks normal too, actually.  When she takes his mask off in the \\"point of no return\\", his hair suddenly turn white, dishoveled, and there are quite a few chunks of it missing <br />-Before Christine passes through the mirror, she has no make up on whatsoever, but when she wakes up in the Phantom's lair, the shadow around her eyes is quite noticable <br />-When Christine leaves the Opera house to visit the cemetery, she is wearing a white nightgown, when she arrives at the cemetary, she is wearing a black dress with a trailer.  I tried to make this one out because you'll notice that she takes a black cape off of a hook before she buys the roses, so I though that must be it, but in the cemetery scene, no trace of white is visible. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was great, the Phantom was gorgeous, the music was stunning, and the acting was good. <br /> <br />If you still haven't been aquainted with this musical, I highly recommend it, if not for the people or the movie, then for the music.

B00003CXB2|5.0|I was home for the holidays, in between semesters and I pulled out a few of these 'oldies but goodies.' I had gotten 2 tickets to the opening week of this release in NYC for my Mom and Dad, when Lawrence first came out 40+ years ago. After, we went to Sardi's and talked about it. I think my Mom had a crush on Peter O'Toole and my Dad thought David Lean walked on water.<br /><br />What? You thought I was going to talk about the Movie?<br /><br />Several reviewers have pointed out that watching the film on anything but the end zone screen in Giant Stadium waters down the film. True. However I would point out that Olivier's \\"Hamlet\\" in black and white on my Sony ain't so hot either, but it's still the best.<br /><br />O'Toole is brilliant as the odd, turn of the century character caught in one world and drawn to another, who convices the British Command that he would serve their WWI goals by observing Prince Faisel (Alec Guiness, also remarkable) in attempting to unify the disparate, warring Arabian tribes. The  ultimate goal being tha Faisel (not Lawrence) would lead them against the Turks, one of the Axis powers.<br /><br />Lawrence speaks to all ages about conflicted loyalties and courage. Overplayed but still one of my favorite scenes is when he is asked by a colleague after letting a match burn down to his fingers, 'does it hurt?', and answers dispassionately \\"of course it hurts. The idea is to not let anyone know that it hurts.\\"<br /><br />Like the idiotic dance sequence in Jimmy Stewart's brilliant \\"The Flight of the Phoenix,\\" (if I'm hallucinating in the desert it's going to be about a cold Bud) the KNOWING stares between O'Toole and Jose Ferrer are just stupid. The Christ metaphors and the homosexual innuendo that people talk about . . . ignore them. Just enjoy one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Great British-Irish crew of stage trained actors at the peak of their profession, Guiness. Quayle. Hawkins. O'Toole. Rains.Still the best epic but if not, certainly on the top 10 of everyone's list. 5 stars. Larry Scantleburypic but if not, certainly on the top 10 of everyone's list. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury

B000000WF0|5.0|The Verve's \\"Urban Hymns\\" came out of nowhere in the middle of the 90's as it essentially sounds like nothing else that came out in that decade. With \\"Urban Hymns\\", The Verve crafted 3 classic songs - 2 of which nobody really knows (and they are - the hit \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", \\"Sonnet\\" and \\"Lucky Man\\"). These 3 songs alone give the album GREAT mainstream appeal. Though these 3 are fantastic pieces, the rest of the album doesn't hold up as greatly (though that would be incredibly hard to do for ANY band). Richard Ashcroft (the singer) is dead-on considering the band's style, and the lyrics are heartfelt and meaningful. The musicianship is great and occasionally extremely emotional (see \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" with its violens). Most people will really like this album, and even if it takes a while to sink in (it did for me, too) you'll eventually recognize its greatness. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album (arguably the worst is \\"Neon Wilderness\\")!
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I think the illustrations are as tasteful as can be expected considering subject matter. I thought the mention that \\"babies wear diapers\\" was unfortunate cuz for the true resisting pooper, like my daughter, that was all she needed to see to say \\"See? I am still a baby!\\" So I skipped over that page fast...... I also found I had to add alot of my own explanations to the book....which is not a bad thing - gets parent involved...  <br /> <br />BUT I would not go as far as to say this helped my daughter to poop in potty....it certainly opened up the subject to talk about.... but it did not in any way help her do it. As a matter of fact, when she finally did do it, it'd been awhile since we read the book.....  <br /> <br />Anyway once they DO poop on potty, then this just gets kept on the book shelf....who wants to talk about poop unless you have to....??  <br /> <br />SO yes, it helps you get out the \\"everyone poops\\" message.....but pooping on the potty? That is a different story. See if someone has one to lend you rather then buying it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Though Coldplay's \\"Parachutes\\" may be the more artistically interesting album, \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" contains more hitworthy classics and is much more accessible. The song \\"Clocks\\", for example, is just a timeless pop rock tune with it's wonderful lyrics, excellent instrumentation and catchy hook. The rest of the album is definitely on par with this song - tracks like \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" are other noteworthy classics. Once again, Chris Martin delivers inspired and emotional vocals that give each song that much more charm. Every song here is great, and all the lyrics are worthy of repeated listens. The musicianship may not be terribly complex in every song, but even in its relative simplicity it sucks you in and doesn't let go. The only arguably \\"bad\\" song here is \\"A Whisper\\". Pop rock fans and practically everyone who says they love music will adore this album. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  everything except, perhaps, \\"A Whisper\\"

B00005ASHM|5.0|The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" is the best sunshine pop (let alone 60's pop) album EVER recorded. This album is SO original and SO cheerful that you can't help but love it. The most well-known songs on here are the hits \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"Sloop John B.\\", \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Caroline No\\", but the other tracks are just as good and interesting. The Beach Boys are famous for their harmonies and vocals, and this album does not disappoint. The musicianship is definitely 60's, but the audio quality and the instrumentation is perfect. Another great thing about this album is how quotable and interesting the lyrics are - they're some of the best ever written! You'll absolutely love singing along to songs like \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\"! Fans of every genre will love this album (you'd be hardpressed not to), as this is an instant classic. Buy it now!    Highlights include:  the entire album
B00005JOIF|4.0|This is a good, satisfying, if too long and sometimes melodramatic film that lays out a very simple story that makes you think for a long time afterward.  Somehow Spielberg overcomes some of the limitations of a melodramatic script and made something elegant and oddly real.  It made me think more about terrorism than three years' worth of pompous national news programs put together that can't seem to get beyond deep voiced soundbytes.  I am not a Spielberg fan, but I liked Schindler's List and I liked this movie, too.<br /><br />The movie has a number of imperfections, most notably an inexcusable run time:  stretches of the move are repetitive and could easily have been cut. Second, despite some dazzling one liners, the Kushner screenplay is all too often Hollywoodish and the characters and action more like a fictional novel than an historical one. And third, the fact that the details are reputed to be fictional (though who knows what is and isn't?) can really detract from getting into the movie. For example, the Israeli team are laughably amateur and the French syndicate everyone uses for intelligence is supposed to be both anonymous and yet used by everyone.  I couldn't stop by brain from taking me out of the experience and saying, \\"This seems far fetched.  Could this be true?\\"<br /><br />At the same time, much may be forgiven here, as a good part of what the film wants to do is to convey the unavoidable typology of fighting terrorists by taking a snapshot of its wide-eyed infancy after the Munich massacre, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were concerned with other things (each other). For those of us who remember Munich and the rest of the terrorist-laden '70's, there's an emotional connection to the movie that is never disappointed despite the flaws of the source material. Like a Shamalayan movie faithful to the character of the palpable Pennsylvania locations, Spielberg recreates the 1970's in a way that is not at all Hollywoodish (thus clashing with the screenplay) and in a way that makes the time period and locations so real it opened up parts of myself. As in his flawed \\"Minority Report,\\" the world is better than the script. So when, for example, the screenplay provides a didactic exchange that roots terrorism in an ideal construction of \\"home\\" as a nation (over family and tribe), Spielberg brings home the emotional and intellectual impact of that on the protagonist, as each successive and inevitable compromise in hunting terrorists (accidental civilian death, dubious or nonexistent evidence, no judicial checks, compromises to gain intelligence, and strategic failure, since killing terrorist leaders usually leads to more militant leaders quickly replacing them) forces him to either fully embrace the same position or leave him a casualty of thinking too much.<br /><br />A number of people have posted in various places that this is pro-terrorist or some such thing.  Don't believe them:  too many Bill O'Reilly wannabes in this world.  The compromises made in the war on terrorism are shown to be tragic (especially on the ones charged with carrying it out, not so much on those who trumpet their heroism from the safety of home), but that is all the movie says.  It does not say these compromises are wrong or right, and it certainly does not claim anything about moral equivalency.  To say that making a movie about Avner is wimpish on terrorism is to say that any media paying attention to our damaged veterans is unpatriotic.  Judge it for yourself.a way that makes the time period and locations so real it opened up parts of myself. As in his flawed \\"Minority Report,\\" the world is better than the script.

B000002MP2|5.0|Most punk-pop albums are horribly cheesy and are very much guilty pleasures (like Tsar's \\"Tsar\\" and Plain White T's \\"All That We Needed\\" - they're classics but in a cheesy way), but not Green Day's \\"Dookie\\". These songs are flat-out rockin' and extremely entertaining - they have tons of energy. Bille Joe Armstrong is perfect for the band's hard rockin' style and the lyrics are pretty catchy and memorable albeit hard to make out most of the time (you'll probably sing along to the hits). Upon close inspection the album seems to be a tad bit uneven. Obvious stand-outs include \\"Welcome To Paradise\\", \\"Longview\\", \\"Basket Case\\", \\"She\\", and \\"When I Come Around\\". Probably the most appealing punk-pop album to those who don't usually think much of the genre (like me!). This is an album that basically every living punk-pop band today tries and fails to emulate. Most people will love this album. If you are also into cheesier punk-pop than I would suggest Tsar's \\"Tsar\\" and Plain White T's' \\"All That We Needed\\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Burnout\\"  \\"Having A Blast\\"  \\"Longview\\"  \\"Welcome To Paradise\\"  \\"Basket Case\\"  \\"She\\"  \\"When I Come Around\\"  \\"In The End\\"  \\"F.o.d.

B000301YY8|5.0|When I put James Blunt on my CD Player to listen to it, it stopped me in my tracks. I stopped everything I was and sat down and listened. It has been a very long since an artist stopped me in my tracks. This CD is amazing - dirty words and all...the elegance, sadness and love - all parts of his music.  If you don't want to hear the F-bomb, get the clean version, but the raw sensuality of this album is well worth the purchase.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|\\"Is This It\\" and \\"Room On Fire\\" were wonderfully fun and catchy albums that showcased The Strokes' eye for hooks and (relatively) deep and memorable lyrics. \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\", though definitely more mature (and mellower), unfortunately is uneven and doesn't work most of the time (it's filled with a lot of just \\"ok\\" songs). Julian is now front-and-center instead of mixed up with the rest of the instruments as he was on the lo-fi-ish \\"Is This It\\" and \\"Room On Fire\\". He does a decent enough job, but most songs lack the lyrics and impact that made the previous two albums so much fun. They also have a new sound which reminds me of 70's hard rock and the guitars are a little bit reminiscent of 70's prog-rock albums (see \\"Razorblade\\"). The singer sometimes sounds a lot like some of the bands that were trying to copy The Strokes' vocal style (the singing in the third song sounds a lot like Razorlight's singer, which is a little confusing). None of the songs are bad, but they're mostly just \\"ok\\" (the first two are good examples - they have catchy guitar sounds but the singing and lyrics aren't good). \\"Razorblade\\" is easily the best song on the album, even if it's merely \\"good\\". The musicianship, however, is pretty good and quite clear. It's an \\"ok\\" album, but definitely no \\"Is This It\\" or \\"Room On Fire\\" (those albums had NO filler or bad songs whereas this one has several of both). This album *barely* jumps from a \\"2.5\\" to a \\"3\\". If they can write better songs than I think The Strokes will eventually create their well-deserved masterpiece. Strokes fans should be content with this album, but I couldn't really recommend it to anyone else. Non-fans of the band should just pick up their first two albums.    Highlights include:  \\"Juicebox\\" (sort of)  \\"Heart In A Cage\\" (it's decent)  \\"Razorblade\\"  \\"Vison Of Division\\" (sort of)  \\"Electricityscape\\" (sort of)  \\"Fear Of Sleep\\" (it's alright)  \\"15 Minutes\\" (not bad)
B00004W510|5.0|of course, the band is not purely a canadian import, levon is from the south. but let's get to the point, this album is seriously overshadowed by the first, music from the big pink. and if it came down to owning either one or the other, i would buy both. they are both incredible musical statements in the history of american music and will never be surpassed. bands and albums like this come only once in a lifetime, where indigineous styles blend so seemlessly and beautifully, where the songwriting reads like a book, where the souls of men are revealed. the band are extremely inventive, but you can tell where it all came from.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|They keep getting better.  I thought it would be a hit or miss but literally, the whole album is as good as their last and their first.  Catchy, in a quirky way. Tight and well produced, too well produced actually.  This will be in my cd player for awhile.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|elvis costello is never easy to pin down. he's a punk, a crooner, a folkie and a jazzman all at once. one thing is certain, he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter, with a healthy pop sense. before costello branched out into other styles, his main focus on the punky side of pop. and this is his most defining moment in that era. each song on here crackles with the tight energy associated with punk, but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore. moreover, the songwriting is just too clever to ignore, further removing \\"this year's model\\" from the general english punk movement. elvis was always too civilized to be chaotic and angry, more of a crossed up lover than anything else. this year's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone's collection.
B000067J1Q|5.0|Could you believe anyone may have seen \\"The Sound of Music\\" for the first time forty years after it came out? Well, that was me, today. I had seen bits and pieces, of course, and had obviously heard the classic songs (who hadn't, right?). But I just finished watching the movie in its entirety (it lasts close to three hours) for the first time ever, and it truly is as magnificent as everyone said it was.<br /><br />The story is simple, yet powerful: a story of search, love and struggle, starring Julie Andrews playing Maria, a woman who leaves an Austrian convent to assist Captain Georg von Trapp (Michael Plummer), a widower Navy officer with the upbringing of his seven children. The acting of the adults and the children actors is impeccable and the music is so ingrained into the story that one is impossible to conceive without the other, yet it hardly feels like a musical.<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music\\" has got to be without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in my life and a story I will hold dear to my heart.
B0006J28KU|5.0|When I saw HEAT for the first time, some ten years ago, I was stunned by the powerplay that was in the movie, not only through the multi-layer story and the beautiful images by Michael Mann, but also the powerplay of the two main characters. Brought together for the first time in one movie, Pacino and De Niro make an interesting pair of opponents to say the least. Not only is Heat an intense criminal story with a lot of blazing action, it also contains moments of inside looks into the lives of some of the characters. And, alsmost as beautiful as in his latest movie, Collateral, Mann succeeds in painting the city of L.A. in his own great style and in beautiful colors. With this background it's hard to believe maybe, that this movie contains one of the most aggressive shoot-outs in a movie ever. Especially this part of the movie will bring your sound system to the max. The scene itself is filmed, directed and cut in a totally perfect way - it's like you are there. Heat got more than a few thumbs up when it came to the theater and still keeps you nailed to your seat watching it now. This new 172 minute version (2 discs with a great lot of extra material, like cast training, 5 documentaries, revisiting filming locations after 10 year and much more) is a little better than the original version which I also own. The whole package with al the extra's is not to be missed for any true film lover and collector.
B00000DCHD|5.0|52nd street stands out as one of Billy Joel's most musically eclectic albums, second only to \\"An Innocent Man.\\" A master in his craft, Billy Joel had finally become the definitive singer songwriter by 1977. The Piano Man doesn't fail us in this follow up to The Stranger, featuring various flavors of jazz (\\"Zanzibar\\"), R&B (\\"Until The Night\\"), and latin music (\\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\") \\"Big Shot\\" and \\"My Life\\" are easily recognizable as Billy Joel favorites, but there is so much more to the album than meets the eye. None of the other songs received as much radio play as the first three tracks (although I do recall in the late 70s hearing \\"Half a Mile Away\\" quite a bit), so the remaining tracks will be a nice surprise to new fans. Billy stated in an interview a long time ago that he was inspired by the Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" while recording the song \\"Stiletto.\\" The drumming during the chorus is very similar to the drumming at the end of \\"SFF.\\"  As I am a fan of album art preservation, I was a little disappointed with the 1998 release of this cd. There was a good set of photos of the band and Phil Ramone in either the dust jacket or the gatefold of the LP, and those photos are missing. Everything else is intact and the remaster is so clean it's amazing. \\"Until the Night\\" is the definitive tribute to the Righteous Brothers. If you loved The Stranger you will absolutely want to add 52nd Street to your collection. The heart and soul of the Angry Young Piano Man are well represented in this album. Buy it!

At the other end of the jungle is Captain Willard,Special Forces,a trained killer also losing his grip on reality.....just when he`s at his lowest point he is offered what turns out to be his last mission....his orders are to terminate Kurtz`s command - with extreme predjudice.A Navy pbr and its crew are taking Willard up the river to carry out his secret mission,a journey that goes deep into the jungle and the horrors that await them hundreds of miles away.  Powerful acting turns by the entire cast including Marlon Brando,Martin Sheen,Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper.Francis Coppola makes an absorbing and beautiful film that often crackles with intensity.A top five favorite of mine...I guess,from the first time I saw it.A true journey to the heart of one man`s darkness and whatever awaits beyond the end of the glow of a dying candle`s flame.One of the best films of all time.
B000002GYR|5.0|Closing Time is not as dark or quirky as some of the later Tom Waits albums and is an excellent introduction if you are unfamiliar with his music. This album is a beautiful blend of blues and jazz with a hint of country for good measure all delivered by Toms' wonderful smoky, gravelly voice. Although a lot more mellow than later offerings such as Rain Dogs and Swordfish, that indefinable uniqueness that is Tom Waits is still visible.<br /><br />Particularly outstanding are the tracks `Midnight Lullaby', `Martha' and `Grapefruit Moon' although there isn't a single track on this CD that isn't good on this near perfect album. This is one to put on when the lights are low and you just want to kick off your shoes and relax.
B000AA305M|1.0|If I ever see David Gray, I'm going to ask him for my $14 back!  He owes it to me for slapping together this blob of nothing CD.  White Ladder was deep, dark, meaningful, painful, and cathartic.  So, of course I couldn't wait for his next CD to come out.  This is nothing like what I expected from Gray.  Where is the moodiness?  Where is the lyrical rain storm?   True, most of White Ladder consisted of 6 chords, but the THEME and the FEELING were uniquely his.  Life in Slow Motion may be better produced and have a fuller sound, but the entire CD is flat and boring.  The only song indicative of Gray's previous performance is Disappearing World.  One down... NINE to go.  If you are a fan of White Ladder, make sure you get a good listen to this CD before you decide to purchase.  And if you know Mr. Gray.... please tell him I want a refund for this coaster he calls \\"music\\" - I am SO disappointed.

I read all the reviews and decided that I had to have this.  I am so glad.  I fell completely in love with this movie. I have loaned it out already and the gals who borrow it are loving it.  This is one I will watch over and over on weekends just as I do with Pride and Prejudice.  Now I just need to find out if there is a soundtrack available.  I loved the score as well.
B00005JOFO|1.0|I find the director's use of the term \\"gay cowboy love story\\" to be grossly offensive and inaccurate.  These guys aren't real cowboys at all!  Everyone knows that real cowboys only existed in the brief two-week period stretching from the invention of the cow on April 7, 1865, and the invention of the railroad at Promintory point by mormon pioneers thirteen days later, on April 20.  Also, they don't even have six-shooters, and they herd sheep.  It is blatantly false advertising, making this film a huge disappointment.

B00006AUIG|2.0|Overall I wasn't expecting much of this movie when I rented it out... so it's not so bad that I got what I expected! <br /> <br />Really this movie is a horror movie that tries to be artistic and profound. Let's call it a horror movie for those who would be too embarassed to watch Child's Play.  <br /> <br />I didn't mind so much the slowness of the film but the fact that by the end of the film I felt as if I'd watched a 1.5 hour movie that really had nothing much to it. It was creepy in parts but the conclusion to the movie left me confused. <br /> <br />When I watch a movie I at least like to be able to concretely understand the motives of the killer. Was he somehow related to the hospital? Was he possessed by the spirit of Simon (before or after he started renovating the hospital)? Why did his nephew not notice him carrying a knife and the fact that his suit was all bloodied?
0385486804|3.0|Stacey Fredrickson <br />Earth Science Honors <br />Block G <br /> <br />Into the Wild  <br />By: Jon Krakauer <br /> <br />Into the Wild is and interesting book. It really opens your eyes to living in the wilderness. All of the people mentioned in this book chose to live with no designated shelter, little or no food, and no way to communicate. This book does an excellent job explaining how it is ok to go live in the wilderness, but you should plan your trip perfectly. Bring enough food, know the land that your staying on, and have an effective way to communicate. The main story, about Chris McCandless, is very sad. Dying alone in the Alaskan wilderness is no way to die. Dying alone in the wilderness is no way for anyone to die. Overall in to the wild was a good book. It is definitely worth reading, if you are into books about Alaska or surviving in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A7S4B0|5.0|i am surprised how well built of an album this is. at first listen, i was trying to get the feel to it, i really liked the first song. and then, after repeat listens on a vacation to chicago, this album hit me....it is superb! on a music basis, it is very simple and straight, unlike previous works by BRMC where they incorporate more RnR feel; however, this album, is more built on the genuine feelings of the words. now, i am not in a middle of a soul crisis or anything of the sort, but having had  moments of doubt, I could totally relate the direction they decided to take with this album. I applaud BRMC for their efforts and the earnst approach to producing a hell of disc. This is completely different from some of the music out there now that is becoming quite popular, a refreshing down home back to the roots type of music...oh yeah, after listening to the strokes new one, I am disappointed. I had such high expectations of these lads, but continue to disappoint.  their sound is too engineered, too stiff, and I am not a big fan of Cablancas voice.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Despite Depeche Mode's 2001 album \\"Exciter\\" hitting the top 10 and going gold, many fans were slightly disappointed at the softer sound of the album (yours truly included). 4 years later, DM finally released their next album \\"Playing The Angel\\". And boy, what an album it is. A total return to the brooding, edgy synth-pop that made Depeche Mode international stars in the first place.     Although it does have it's awkward moments (\\"Macro\\", while showing great vocals from Martin, tends to get a tad tiresome), the album as a whole is excellent. Highlights include the synth-blasting \\"John The Revelator\\" (my personal favorite), dance classic \\"Suffer Well\\", and the moody but awesome \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\". The final song, \\"The Darkest Star\\", is quite frankly the perfect song to close this album, with its quiet yet sinister melody.     No matter whether you're a fan of Depeche Mode's earlier work (Some Great Reward, Music For The Masses) or their more recent 90s material (SOFAD, Ultra), you're bound to love this album. It's moody, passionate, and just totally rocks. Depeche Mode is back, and they're better than ever.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Take \\"Prizzi's Honor\\"  (look it up if you've never seen it) and remove 80% of the intelligence of that movie.  Mix in \\"Die Hard\\" but  remove 50% of the \\"realism\\" (When Bruce Willis got shot at by a bunch of guys with automatic weapons, at least he was wounded).  Take care not to allow the story to be be tainted with anything resembling plot, logic or believability.  Mix well and you have \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\".   <br /> <br /> <br />But dang!  Those two shore are purty!     <br />
B0000797IO|5.0|I saw this film last night and was amazed at what I was seeing...I brilliant film (another oscar snub) with performances across the board that floored me.  Aniston breaks away from her 'Rachel' persona and breaks into true oscar territory with her role here as Tina Last, a disgruntled wife of pot-head Phil (Played BRILLIANTLY by John C. Reilly who is one of my favorite actors ever) who works a dead-end job at some Texas bargain warehouse.  She hates her job, hates her husband and most of all, in a lot of ways, hates herself for letting her life become what it is.  She then meets Tom (Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance...you think Brokeback was good) who thinks he's the incarnate of Holden from Catcher in the Rye.  He hates his life and hates his parents and hates his job...and even himself.  She falls for him mostly because they have so much in common.  They start an affair that leads to Tina making some grave decisions that lead her to hate herself even more.  The film is a great case-in-point that infidelity can ruin, not only a marriage and a family but a persons spirit and as Tina realizes you have to let go of some of the best things in your life to save your soul from the hurt your causes it to 'put on'...A great emotional story that had my wife in tears and my mind working...recomended to anyone with a family.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is hot hot hot!  I've always been a Madonna fan and I think she's finally found her musical niche with \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\".  The whole cd is like an endless dj club set, each song blending seamlessly into the next.   <br /> <br />The album has a trance-like feel to it, topped with beatiful songs like \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\".  \\"Sorry\\" hits home with anyone who is tired of empty apologies from someone who's wronged them; she puts it simply \\"i've heard it all before\\" and \\"talk is cheap\\" in the song.  Other highlights are \\"Jump\\", a self-motivational song where she encourages you to get off your butt and do something with your life (\\"the more you wait the more time you waste\\") and \\"How High\\"; I think \\"Isaac\\" may be controversial to some but the production is brilliant and is not set in a way to offend.  \\"Hung Up\\" is good but \\"Get Together\\" is better.  \\"Let it Will be\\" encourages you to just \\"let it be\\".   <br /> <br />A few downpoints for me is \\"I Love New York\\", again a great beat but the lyrics are a little juvenile.  Also \\"Push\\" is a good song lyrically but it sounds like she's straining to get the words out.   <br /> <br />All in all, get this album, you'll really like it.  If you don't, then Track #12 \\"Like it or Not\\" explains Madonna at her best; accept her as she is, because that's how she is, like it or not.      <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|To very nearly quote Oscar Wilde, while to lose one lot of critical goodwill may be regarded as misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness. This, however, is Madonna we're considering and, if there's anything the journey from 'Immaculate' to 'Ray Of Light' has shown us, it's that her greatness as an artist lies in the fact that not only can she learn from what appear to be her mistakes, she can actually redeem herself so much that they actually make perfect sense. Hence, without that unlikely pairing with Bj&ouml;rk, we'd never have been treated to the off-kilter imagery of 'Don't Tell Me' or 'Candy Perfume Girl'. Without 'Evita' she'd never have had the voice to pull off performances like 'Ray Of Light' or 'Drowned World'. And even the Sex/'Erotica' double whammy presaged a world in which a then-unthinkable sexual melting pot as Big Brother is ostensibly the mainstream. What, then, can we look forward to here, given that her post-'Music' music has consisted of a ropey Bond theme, an album that steadfastly refused to lodge itself in the public's consciousness or affections, and, heaven help us, a Britney collaboration that was a suspicious-looking stain on both their copybooks?<br /><br />Quite a lot, if 'Hung Up' is anything to go by. As you'll be unfailingly aware by now, it's both a major addition to the impressive where's-the-party pantheon of her canon and something of a minor miracle, with its golden pop shininess, its proactive chutzpah, its wraparound nightlife glamour and, most of all, its insistence that 'Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)' could've been a great song if only it hadn't been so screamingly heterosexual, suggesting that this could actually be Madge's very own 'Light Years'. That, of course, was Kylie's follow-up to a similarly crippling Very Serious Record and, as Mrs Ritchie will be highly conscious of, La Minogue's never looked back. So her spectre looms large over the pleasingly Jacksonian 'Sorry', what with its apologising in - we think - five languages before a talk-to-the-hand! voice comments that we've heard it all before. More notable is the mostly-talky, wallopingly Moroderesque and, let's be honest, utterly-chuffing-glorious 'Future Lovers'. If anything, though, this is a more impure pop album than that would suggest.<br /><br />See, 'Confessions On A Dancefloor' is, in fact, entirely unrelenting in two senses. For one thing, there are no gaps between the tracks at all, designed to suggest more of a complete club experience than the collections of numbers we've become used to. And, moreover, there's all kinds of lurid electro shiftiness juddering across the stereo, courtesy mostly of returning collaborators Mirwais and, in an increasingly sizable collaborative role (the sleevenotes actually say that without him this record would never have happened, so you know where to lay the blame if it disappoints you), Stuart \\"Les Rythmes Digitales\\" Price. 'Forbidden Love' could almost have been a bonus track on the debut album by the latter's Zoot Woman, come to think of it, and sounds like an ideal soundtrack to employ your best come-hither stares to. 'Get Together' is preposterously anthemic, charging away recklessly with all sort of beat buzzes going on before entering a skippy 'Blinded By The Lights'-like patch and waiting a good four minutes before letting the 303 loose in its entirety.<br /><br />Alas, though, this whole endeavour isn't without its niggles. For one thing, the vocal treatments that got somewhat out of hand on 'American Life' are ever-more-alarmingly employed as this goes on, and the promised confessions are far from forthcoming, perhaps as a reaction against the songs that preceded it. 'I Love New York' is a perfect example of this album's dichotomy: with its unapologetic beef and mucky catwalk guitars, it would - and doubtless will - sound amazing at Nag Nag Nag, but pay attention and you'll start longing for the days of \\"I like to singy singy singy / Like a bird on thewingy wingy wingy\\". Quite simply, this is the most disposable lyric sheet she's produced since 'The First Album', and, less generously, there are times when it's actually - whisper it - a bit rubbish, like the uncomfortably overcooked 'Push' or the tiresome fame treatise 'How High', and 'Let It Will Be' is grammatically disastrous to a Gallagherian degree. Her game picks up considerably around the closing 'Like It Or Not', but it'd be a rare Madonna song that could shoehorn Cleopatra and Mata Hari into the same line without being marvellous.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, it may be that we're thinking a bit too much about all this. After all, while there's no denying Madonna's commercial intentions, she hasn't really delivered a home-listening kind of affair, and there can be little doubt that most of this will soundtrack most of the next year for a heftily going-out section of the country in a manner rather more satisfying than initial impressions might indicate. She might not quite have made it through the wilderness just yet, but she's chosen the most glittering road to resurrection she could find, and it's one she walks with no small smattering of style.wingy wingy wingy\\".

B000929AJQ|5.0|whooooooooooooooooooo! i waited six long years for this record to come out! when i bought WT (which i got on the very day it came out) i was estatic! the first spin was great, though i did notice trent made this record more of a raw, potent sound. the backrounds are more mechanical then previous NIN records, but the record was amazing. i liked it more and more with each spin until i could like it no more then i did. if you are a fan of nine inch nails, i would highly reccomend this record. it is a bit different, so give it a couple of spins to adjust, but trust me, trent reznor and nine inch nails are here to stay!
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank escaped me for years until my sister suggested it. I do like prison movies and this has to be the best of the best. I don't always like Tim Robbins but this role is perfect for him. I do always like Morgan Freeman so anything he is in works for me. The cool way Tim Robbins character handles many years in prison is inspirational. The interaction between Tim and Morgan is timeless. The movie never let me down and I can watch it over and over. The revenge ending is perfect as is the direction, acting, and scenery. No computer graphics required here. This is down to earth human storytelling at its best.
B000002AS3|5.0|This album is one of the best things to happen in modern music. It annoys me when everyone compares 'em to the Beatles... so what! Every great artist throughout the history of music has based themselves on someone previous... Michael Jackson and Prince influenced by James Brown and Stevie Wonder, John Lennon by Chuck Berry and Elvis Costello, David Bowie by The Beatles, Madonna by Debbie Harry, it goes on and on... SO WHAT! That's why music evolves and progresses! <br /> <br />And lets face it, its not as if the charts are cluttered with outstanding artists these days, therefore you can't be too critical when something as solid as this comes along, especially when the only alternatives are bland horrors like the hideous Coldplay or the frankly lousy 50cent. GET A GRIP! <br /> <br />Appologies about that little rant, but I felt i needed to get it off my chest! The album is a little corker, I prefer What's the story, but its still an absolute hum-dinger! Classic!
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|if you're like me, you rarely like a film with that \\"written in committee\\"-feel. more scenes with certain actors are thrown in because they want to market the film more on that particular person. 'troy' takes that mentality to the extreme. forget suspension of disbelief: this film suffers from a lack of suspension of boredom of a load of studio executives sitting in around a table saying things like, \\"ok, we've got brad pitt in this, so let's put lots of scenes with him in.\\" \\"why not have him shirtless? appeal to a teenage-girl sort of market?\\" \\"perfect! and we'll cast orlando bloom!\\" \\"oh, the one who had about 10 lines in lord of the rings.\\" \\"yeah, the teenage girls love him.\\"    at this point I'm dying to interject: no, hollywood executives, it's not because he's \\"orlando bloom\\", it was because he was \\"legolas\\", and peter jackson is a skilled enough - not to mention visionary, which I wouldn't even bother trying to explain to these people - director and can actually make you lose sight of the fact that those are actors up there. 'troy' is mired in that fact.    and while we're on the subject of unfavourable comparisons to lord of the rings, let's see what our committee is up to: \\"oh, yeah, people love big battle scenes. have you seen the numbers for those ring-y movies?\\" \\"yeah, so we'll need lots of extras.\\" \\"don't forget the horses!\\"    wait a second here, executives. that sounds like you're making a 1940's western. wasn't that the very thing that killed 'old hollywood' the first time around? an emphasis on big stars and the \\"see how many horses you can fit in the shot\\" mentality? the battles in jackson's LOTR films succeed in that they actually FEEL huge, using a deft combination of emphasis on the gritty details of just one soldier and the 10,000 others all moving as one huge mass, telescoping back and forth seemingly effortlessly so that you are absorbed by the hugeness of everything while not losing sight of the characters. that takes creativity: peter jackson didn't just throw money at the problem to make it go away.    'troy' doesn't understand that at all. boredom sets in after the first few seconds of any particular battle scene, and the drag only gets worse, pulling down everything with it, including acting and mere consistency with previous scenes. in the anti-climactic climax of one such battle, as we are forced to take in dialogue between an over-earnest eric bana with a regrettable choice of accent and a bored-looking brad pitt sacking the temple of apollo, one might think: hang about, have they conveniently forgotten the huge raging battle supposedly still taking place outside? because all we get is dead silence. the dialogue is so awful that any clanking of swords and shields outside might completely overshadow it.    there's a lot of that kind of nit-picking to be done with many of the choices made in this film. to be fair, they were plagued by waterworld-esque weather and location problems, and at $200 million, you really just need to get the picture finished, because hey, no one's really happy that it cost that much in the first place. but if there's one thing I'd say is the most glaring error in this film, it's that it really has no audience. is it directed towards men? surely they'll be turned off by the parade of shirtless beaus strutting about like they're on the cover of a romance novel without any real female equivalent to counterbalance that (helen, the most beautiful woman in the world according to the story, is actually fairly dull in 'troy'. does that sum up the entire film?) is it directed towards teenage girls? they might be turned off by the stupid hollywood violence, the dialogue (\\"you are a great king because you love your country!\\" ad nauseum), and... well, perhaps anything about this film, especially its generally chauvinist demeanor. families? no... students of the classics? no, the committee decided not to pander to them whatsoever fairly early on, it seems. ok, who's left... people wholike bad films for a cheap laugh? well, at 2h 42m, it's really just too much of an investment. it's sure to bore the pants off of basically anyone.    and they wonder why the hollywood studio system is doomed. anyone who helped put up the money for this film should feel very bad about what they've done, above and beyond the sorrow at having parted with that money for good. they've trusted a group of people and an entire system that doesn't really have a clue what it's doing. we've passed the age of 'bankable' stars and audiences who don't know that the studios think they're stupid. people are starting to get the message.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|If founding member of Korn, Head, leaving the band because he \\"found Jesus\\" wasn't a sign of this band's demise, as well as the band already releasing a \\"Best of\\" disc, I don't know what else you could be looking for.  Head, in this situation, was the smart one and got out at a good time... well, maybe a little bit late, but at least he moved on before See You on the Other Side festered its way onto the scene. <br /> <br />This cd, Korn's sixth full length studio effort, sees the band experimenting much more than they have in the past. In a day and age where most successful bands are content to keep churning out the same cd over and over again, Korn should be applauded for showing some progression, right? Right? <br /> <br />I suppose, but only if you don't care about quality in your music.  With nu-metal, the genre that Korn helped spearhead, being viewed mostly as a joke nowadays, at least Korn recognized that a change is something they needed. Actually, it could just be dumb luck that they modified their sound now, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. It's just too bad, though, that the execution of their experimentation came off so poorly. <br /> <br />There are still some trademark Korn sounds on this album, such as Jonathan Davis' unique voice, even if is only used by him to croon out horribly written lyrics such as \\"What's it like decapitated / Can you see me fascinated\\" from \\"Love Song\\" or \\"Everybody's raped / Lying to your face / Kicks you in the gut / Slayed you here all messed up\\" from \\"Politics\\".  There's also some use of bagpipes, which could have actually been done without, and every now and then the guitars have that old school Korn thickness.  Other than those few items, this is a new and bastardized version of Korn. <br /> <br />Instead of the meaty slap-bass, crunch-o-rific riffs, and unintelligent yet aggressive vocal attacks of old, you'll now have odd ballads (\\"Open Up\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\"), dancy vocals and beats (\\"Twisted Transistor\\"), hand claps (\\"Coming Undone\\"), nu-hop-metal (\\"For No One\\"), strings (\\"Seen It All\\"), and general lacklusterness (everything else).  Instead of looking at all of the good trends in heavy music that have proliferated in the last couple of years, Korn thought it would be good to make use of all the clichs that nu-metal has tried to shed in the last half decade.  Bad move.  Thanks for setting the genre back 3 years. <br /> <br />The only positive to really come out of this cd is that it quite easily put Korn back on top in their rival popularity contest with Limp Bizkit with the peer group being steroid pumping jocks, wannabe troublemaking fifth graders, and backwater hick metalheads.  Then again, it wouldn't take much to top The Unquestionable Truth pt. 1, but we'll let that go.  Any way you look at it, both albums are utter garbage and shouldn't be bought by anyone with half a mind... or even a quarter of one.
B00005JNQA|3.0|The acting in this movie is just fine...Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn.  Enough said.<br /><br />This is a political thriller in which a U.N. language interpreter (Kidman) accidentally overhears a plot to assassinate a world leader.  The world leader is pretty well hated by most, making the movie plot even more complicated.  The U.S. government starts to look at the interpreter as a suspect in the plot. And so on, and so on.<br /><br />It was unbelievable from the beginning.  For example, security suspects a danger threat at the U.N. building.  They evacuate it.  The interpreter comes back later in the evening to get her flute she left in the interpreter's booth.  I'm sure anyone knows that whether you have a badge or not, you are NOT getting back into a government building that has been evacuated.  But this was very important to the plot since this is when Kidman overhears the plot.<br /><br />The movie gets rather complicated with acronyms of government agencies and political ideals.  It's a little hard to follow unless you have a political or government background.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Like I said, the acting was just fine.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Being a long-time fan of Porcupine Tree isn't always easy. Steven Wilson is known to have said that one must be able to accept their music as consistently inconsistent. This is good. Deadwing is a stretch for me, why I'm not certain. The Wilson master craftsmanship is expectably present. Richard Barbieri continues his reign as one of the great synthesists of all time (remember Japan?). Colin Edwin's bass playing remains fluent and, likeably, more to the front. I guess what I miss SW's sweeping guitar solo's that made Signify such a phenomenal outing. I also miss the spidery power drumming of Chris Maitland. I've no doubt that Gavin Harrison may be a technical genius. Unfortunately his drumming lacks personality. Furthermore, I don't understand why, with a few exceptions, he just pounds his way through cymbal-snare-cymbal-snare, occasionally punctuated buy some nifty footwork. This may be the one thing that bothers me most. Compared to his work on In Absentia - well, I hope he's not developing carpal tunnel. In the end, Deadwing will probably pass by as one of my less favorite PT albums. Judging by the skittily-zillion 5 stars, I feel like a traitor giving it 4. To those for whom this is the first exposure to PT, you have tapped into rich vein that bears scrupulous mining. Bon Voyage.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As a child i had a deck of cards with all kinds of monsters and the Phantom of the Opera card always gave me the creeps showing Eric without his mask though i never knew his story.  My wife who enjoys horror genre got me to see this creepy chick flick.  Well my surprise was i was intrigued with the story of how a young nubile can get into a trap.  My favorite part was the duet song, Point of no Return with Christine and the phantom, where the young cavalier in the balcony discovers her kinky relationship with the phantom.  This made me heart felt for all three in that very passionate scene.  With alot of great songs , the whole picture looking great, plenty of action, especially the snow sword fight scene and Minnie Driver the diva for some comedy makes for a full 5 star clip!!!
0131103628|5.0|One of the first things that drew me to this book was the fact that it is relatively small and \\"thin.\\" I've wasted my money so many times in those big, bloated, know-it-all books that it was certainly a relief to see that the authors of this great book stuck to the point and did it magnificently. The explanations are no-fuss, no-nonsense. I've used Java, Lisp and some perl for a number of years and never \\"dared\\" to try C because I was under the impression that C was this monstruous beast that only people looking for an \\"assembly wrapper\\" used. This book (together with Kochan's) dispells that notion and further shows how approachable and powerful C really is.  <br />The chapters on Pointer/References/Arrays/Linked Lists is simply put bar-none--so good that even if the book contained only those two or three chapters it would still be a good buy! As a matter of fact, I think those chapters explain the concepts better than Kochan's (which I still think is one of the best C books out there). <br />What I love is the inherent minimalism of the book: it explains very, very well those topics that strictly necessary to understand and use the language and leaves out all the fuss and/or \\"cool\\" features that are not \\"internal\\" to the language. This book not only is a GREAT intro in and of itself, but also an outstanding complement to any other C book.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have all of Evanescence's CDs, dating from when the band's founders (Amy Lee and Ben Moody) were teenagers.  They have always been an excellent band, but their style has matured greatly since their beginning.  Amy's operatic voice captivates listeners, and she is backed up by awesome guitar riffs and beautiful pianos--and in some cases, kick-@$$ choirs.  The lyrics are deep and emotional, easily identified with while everyone gets their own message out of each song.  The Christian music industry was angry with Evanescence when the band asked not to be associated with Christian rock, but the Christian industry needs to understand that the band doesn't have some sort of hidden message.  One or two songs might have sort of a religious message, but non-Christians are free to enjoy Evanescence as well.<br /><br />I love every song on this CD, and I anxiously await their new CD, which Amy has said should be released in March 2006.  ^-^  Can't wait!
0517123207|5.0|This book is a must read.  This is the theory of evolution, pure and simple.  And for those out there that bash Darwin as an athetist and who is ruining society with his crazy idea an idea that isn't so crazy considering that it just so happens to be lawlike in the scientific community, similar to the law of gravity, please read the last sentence of the book!  Very carefully!!!
B000687M48|5.0|To be honest, I bought Anywhere But Home for the bonus DVD.  I expected the Evanescence music videos, which I had never seen, and I was not disappointed.  The CD itself (and part of the DVD) is live concert footage from Paris.  All the songs from Fallen are performed on live (with the sole exception of 'Hello'), and the band's songs 'Farther Away' and 'Breathe No More' are also performed live.  There is a bonus studio track, 'Missing', which was cut at the last minute from Fallen.  This track is beautiful and I love it to death.<br /><br />I can understand why some people were disappointed that this is \\"only a live album\\", but the DVD is awesome.  As I mentioned before, it shows the concert in Paris, the music videos, and it also has special features which include bloopers and interviews with the band members.  (And Amy Lee making Jello shots, LOL.)  It's worth the money and I'm glad I bought it.
1400034779|3.0|It surprises me that so many people felt passionately about this book.  The book wasn't bad or boring, but far from superb (in my opinion).  It was an okay book.  The mysteries were easily solved and I was just left feeling a little blah about the whole book.  The writing style was nice.  The cultural aspects were interesting, but the story was not.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is could be titled \\"The life of a star\\". Look at the lyrics - they are mostly about senseless hero-worship of celebrities, and basically the \\"birth\\" of a new celebrity, ot antichrist. I don't know (not care) whether Manson really is a Satanist - this album has nothing to do with God, the Devil, or Good vs. Evil. The climactic tune, \\"The Reflecting God\\", has these lyrics: \\"I went to God just to see/And I was looking at me/Saw Heavena and Hell were lies\\" (ok so the last line may be repudiating religion). But the thrust is that he saw God in himself, whether due to the worhip (\\"Mr. Superstar\\", \\"Deformography\\") or his own ego. When I say \\"his\\", I am not refering to Manson, but the character in the lyrics. Unfortunately, his shock value and the hard driving guitars tend  to alienate some to the point where they wont even listen to the lyrics. <br /> <br />Manson+Reznor = great rock epic for the 90's!
B000683VI4|5.0|I stayed clear of this because I was teased it was a chick flick.  I humbly admit I wish I'd seen it sooner.  As someone who has made humor a prominent trait in my marriage I appreciated Allie and Noah's fun together.  Noah wasn't a mushy guy but cool and caring.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is not a sequel to \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" per se; this is about dissassociation, depression, pain; and about the hollowness of stardom and Hollywood. I was coming out of a bad break up when I first heard \\"User Friendly\\" (appropriately, living in LA). It became my anthem for a short while as the bad breakups kept coming on...lol <br /> <br />But, after being exposed to some of the \\"glamorous\\" elements of Hollywood, how could I not identify with this album? From the very first chord of \\"Great Big White World\\" to the mournful chorus of \\"Coma White\\", this - like \\"AS\\" - is a tale told in song. The \\"softer\\" edge of Manson makes this less replusive to some, and once they listen to the music and lyrics, they start to appreciate it. It's usually by the time \\"The Speed of Pain\\" kicks in... <br /> <br />Another one of the great rock albums of the 90's.
0440241588|4.0|Let me start by saying that I've read all of Grisham's books, and loved every one. As a struggling writer, I have been trying to figure out his secret. His books are written in a way that makes you want to keep turning pages, but I'm not sure why. He jumps from one point of view to another seemingly at random, but it still works. There's not much description, but somehow I can visualize each scene. I guess if I could figure it out, I too would be the author of many books.<br /><br />The Broker was a little different than some. Grisham admits in the Author's Note at the end of the book that he knows little about spies, and he reminds us it is all fiction. I was a little concerned about the CIA's actions in the book, but it made for an interesting story. However, I couldn't understand the decision to so quickly kill off one of the characters, who could've led to the bad guys. I don't want to give away the plot. As usual in Grisham's books, this one includes suspense and twists.<br /><br />I bogged down a little in the excessive (in my opinion) descriptions of dining in Italy. Grisham confesses, at the end of the book, that he put on ten pounds doing the research. However, that does not mean that I didn't enjoy reading these sections of the book. I just mean the action slowed. It was more like a Michener book than a Grisham. All in all, another great read.
B00000IMTF|1.0|First of all, I want to make clear that I think this is a phenomenal, 5-star album.  This review is for the remastered edition of the cd only.  If you already have the original cd release of this, hold on to it.  That one has problems, but it at least sounds true to the original album.  This remaster is an atrocity.  The drums dominate the mix (sorry Cozy -- I don't love you THAT much), while the vocals float in the background.  Worst of all, you have to strain to hear the guitar in many parts, with the synthesizer far more prominent.  Whoever remixed this is an idiot.  Evidently, they think that Ritchie Blackmore was the LEAST important person in this band.  I assume that most Rainbow fans would disagree--with no disrespect to the rest of this legendary lineup.  Rainbow Rising is classic rock for people who enjoy guitar, not nu-metal for people who want to demo their subwoofers.  It should have been mixed that way.    Beyond the sound of it, all these Rainbow remastered re-issues are a rip-off in every other way, as well.  No liner notes.  No lyrics.  No bonus tracks (not even the inclusion of \\"Jealous Lover\\" with Difficult to Cure, which was on a cd single at the time of the album's release).  These re-issues are the worst I've seen from any band.  Compare them to the Deep Purple anniversary remasters and it becomes obvious how much more could have been done with these.  In my opinion, this is an insult to the diehard fans who are purchasing these releases for the third or fourth time (lp, first cd release, Japan import cd, and newly \\"remastered\\" version).  If you don't have this yet, you should buy any version you can find as quickly as possible, because you've been missing out.  But for anyone who already has a previous release of this cd, you should just save your money.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Just got this for Christmas. No question, it's one of the best BBC dramas I have seen. I read the book several years ago and I remember thinking at the time: this would make a great film. This production exceeded my expectations.  <br /> <br />
0380973634|5.0|One of the enjoyments of reading this novel is the figuring out of who's who in the whole story. Mr. Gaiman prods along his readers expertly with his ingenious way of story telling. There exist London Above and London Below. Each character in London Below possesses a special power while Mayhew who is from London Above plays the most normal person's role. It is a learning experience for Mayhew from start to finish. Croup and Vandemar lurk in every corner to jeopardize the good guys' expedition in any way they could, especially with murder, for the sake of pure satisfaction of evildoing plus compensation of wealth. The dialogues seem real and dryly humored. Fight scenes are included, making the tale more breathtaking. And, of course, as in any other Mr. Gaiman's novels, dreams, calm or terrifying, are featured throughout the book.
1591396190|5.0|I'm highly skeptical on these \\"new trends, new concepts\\", and that's the way I approached this book. <br />However I was positively surprised by the serious job done by these INSEAD Professors. <br />This book is an interesting treaty on how to be different AND successful in the biz. world. Well written, it not only gives inspiring examples of companies that are thriving, but it also presents an overview of the common strategic process undertaken by the majority of the companies in the world. So besides presenting it is own distinctive concept of good strategy, it also reviews the well-known concepts of Porter and other great authors. <br />Makes you study, think, and, hopefully get new ideas to apply to your biz. <br />Thumbs up!
0805066691|5.0|My post contradicts most others on here. In it, I will prove that the content of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is gross distortion of fact and reality. Of course, the many Bleeding Heart's, Know-nothing's, and people who enjoy spending their time feeling sorry for some cause (in this case, the American Indian) will want to stone me to death for such blasphemy of their \\"God's Gospel Truth\\" version of frontier history. However, I dare you to read my point-by-point debunking of this book through entirely before making up your mind to purchase it.    1. The view of many who post reviews here is that \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" contains \\"authentic\\" statements and discourses from various wild and hostile Indians. These flowery, high-sounding statements are taken as FACT concerning the Indian's spirituality and intellectual capacities, not to mention their \\"feelings\\" about war with European invaders.    FACT: The only words on record from any of the Indians featured in this book were obtained through interpreters. No Indian featured in this book could speak English, or even broken English while free or just after settling on reservations, well enough to make complex statements about anything. Those who interpreted their words on all occasions were rough-and-ready frontier scouts, semi-educated Indians of tribes allied to the European invaders, or US Government Agents on reservations - none of whom had the command of the English language to provide renditions of such flowery, high-sounding statements. Therefore, it must be assumed that all statements in this book were generated by Eastern journalists, professional philanthropists, and sky-pie Eastern Liberals of the days shortly after the tribes had been passified - all Whites who had never seen a wild Indian in their lives, but who wanted to romantacize these wild Indians and construct an image of them as being some sort of Red Aristocrats or feather-wearing Philosopher-Sages of the plains (in much the same way crankmovies like Dances With Wolves do today). There is no way on earth that these statements contained in \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" came directly from the lips of any hostile leader or warrior. Even if \\"official\\" sources, such as Government personnel were responsible for interpreting SOME of the statements in \\"Bury My Heart...\\" they still cannot be considered as authentic word-for-word translations because Indian languages didn't have many of the descriptives found in these high-toned and eloquent statements and they seem like an attempt to make conquered enemies appear more noble, refined, and elite than they actually were - perhaps to bolster the ego of those running the Federal Government, the Army, etc.       2. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that  Indian \\"Lands\\" existed as distinct and definable territories until invaded by Europeans.    FACT: The Indians of the western frontier were nomadic and constantly at war with one another over the best hunting grounds. Before the arrival of Europeans, these Indians existed at the Stone Age level with no technology beyond stone, bone, or wooden-tipped arrows, lances, and simple bows. They did NOT comprise \\"Nations\\" because they had no DEFINED TERRITORIES in which they lived, nor any set system of politics. They existed as wandering TRIBES and operated within these tribes as BANDS.      3. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that Indian \\"Nations\\" lived upon their ancestral \\"Lands\\" for countless generations until they were dispossessed by invading Europeans.    FACT: No Indian tribe ever had a distinct and stable \\"homeland\\". Here are some examples of what I mean. During the early years of the fur trade, the Sioux existed in the forests of eastern Canada until being driven out onto the plains of what is now Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Nebraska by other tribes who obtained fire arms from trade with the French and British. Once on the plains, the Sioux attacked the Kiowa and Cheyenne, who lived at that time around the Black Hills area, and drove these tribes southward. The Sioux also attempted to totally exterminate the Pawnee and Absaroke (Crow) tribes, but were unsuccessful because the warriors of these two tribes were superior fighters even though far fewer in numbers than the Sioux.   Equally, the Comanche (who through linguistic similarities can be traced to Aztecan roots deep in Old Mexico) had been living in what became Montana for a few generations until they were attacked and driven south by the Crow and Blackfoot. The Comanche eventually ended up on the southern plains of what became the States of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. Here they ran into large bands of the Apache tribe. The Comanche were both fierce and prolific (numbering over 20,000 at their zenith) and they slaughtered the Apache - some bands  to total extermination - and drove the remaining survivors of other bands west into the mountans of New Mexico and Arizona, and south into Mexico.   The Crow tribe seems to have originated in some swampy locale, because the names they often gave their offspring (Alligator-Stands-Up, for example) did not match any animal of the northern plains where they were living at the time of European migration.  These are just a few examples of how the various tribes contiually shifted around the continent, driven to do so by pressures applied by enemy tribes.      4. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee holds that the Indians were natural conservationists who \\"loved the land and their animal brothers\\" and who only took what they needed in their hunting - never wasting anything.    FACT: Unknown to most people, the horse existed in the Americas in prehistoric times. Europeans were NOT responsible for the first appearance of the horse on this side of the world. However, by the time Europeans arrived with domesticated horses, the Indians had long since hunted the prehistoric horses to extinction as a source of food (by the way, the prehistoric form of the horse is still alive and well in Eastern Russia - \\"Prezwalzki's Horse\\"). Also, the Indians saw nothing wrong with destroying entire herds of bison even if they didn't need the supplies that so many dead animals offered. I call attention to the \\"Head Smashed In\\" Buffalo Jump in Alberta, Canada as an example of this. Whole herds were stampeded off these cliffs and their remains were casually used by the Indians until sufficient supplies were obtained, and the rest of the dead bison were left to waste.   Also, captive White children who were restored to their families by the Texas Rangers and US Army after being taken by marauding Apache and Comanche in Texas told of how these Indians commonly killed bison and only drank the blood and ate the stomach contents before consuming the kidneys and heart raw. They often left the remainder of the meat to waste and moved on.   It is a matter of fact that the only reason why the Indians did not kill more wildlife in greater numbers is because they lacked the technology to do so. They could only kill so many bison or deer or antelope with arrows, spears, or cliff stampedes, and that's why the populations of the tribes remained basically constant and low in numbers. They had reached their capacity to support their populations by means of their Stone Age hunting and technology, and their numbers simply didn't grow beyond a certain point because of this.      5. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that Indians were generally placid, tranquil, peace-loving folk who only went to war to defend their \\"Lands\\" from aggressive invasion.    FACT: The plains Indians built their one-dimensional cultures around two simple components. These were hunting and warfare. These tribes hunted for their subsistance and warred with one another primarily to obtain the best hunting grounds and secondarily to achieve \\"glory\\" within the context of their value systems. To back these FACTS up, I call attention again to the Apache/Comanche conflict. As I stated earlier, the Comanche slaughtered the Apache on the southern plains and took control of that territory (now known as \\"the Great Comanche Grasslands\\"), which was prime hunting grounds for the southern bison herds. However, the Comanche continued to pursue the Apache and destroy them whenever possible, such as when the Spanish were experiencing severe destruction of ranches and missions at the hands of the Apache in one Mexican Province. The Spanish invited several bands of Comanche to come to that province and exterminate the Apache for profit (6 Pesos for each Apache scalp brought in by the Comanche). At the end of one year, the Provincial Treasury had paid the Comanche more than 18,000 Pesos. Also, many tribes kept slaves. The Comanche kept Apache, Cheyenne, Osage, Tonkawa, Caddo, and Navajo slaves and ran a lucrative slave trade with Spanish land owners in Mexico.   The teeming masses of Sioux fought all other tribes they came in contact with - attempting to exterminate the more stubborn ones who the Sioux couldn't run out of desired territories - and only allied themselves with the Cheyenne at the end of the frontier era.   All tribes practiced mutilation and torture. Some were cannibals. The Tonkawas, for example; routinely ate Comanche, Apache, Kiowa, and Osage enemies (cooked or raw depending upon mood).  There was no mercy or \\"fair play\\" between the tribes and none provided to invading Europeans by most Indians either. It was quite common for Indians of each western tribe to slaughter the women and children of other tribes they were at war with. Or, barring outright slaughter, to use them as slaves or sell them as slaves, or rape and torture them to death while in captivity.   The Politically Correct Bleeding Heart stance holding that Indians only killed women and children of invading Europeans AFTER the Europeans had killed the women and children of the Indians ( as stated in Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee ) is totally false and infact, an absolute trumped-up lie. The Indians were killing, capturing, raping, and selling the women and children of their own race long before Europeans appeared on the scene, and they simply added White women and children to the list of their prey afterward.      6. The view in Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is that the various Indian tribes of the western frontier all suffered terribly at the hands of European invaders while these tribes desperately attempted to keep Treaty agreements and the European invaders relentlessly broke them.     FACT: Apache, Comanche, Pawnee, Tarahumara, Crow, Tonkawa, Cree, Blackfoot, Mandan, and other tribes were utterly delighted to kill their Red cousins on behalf of the European invaders. If they could obtain better weapons or trade goods, or if they could hope to destroy old tribal enemies, many Indians happily joined the White invaders in wars against other Indians. This routine had gone on all the way back to the conquest of the Aztecs by Cortez! No extensive attempts to convince them on the part of Whites was necessary. The various tribes WANTED to fight on behalf of the European invaders!   Equally, many bands of Indians (Apaches are good examples of this) fought other bands WITHIN THEIR OWN TRIBE for profit and on behalf of the White invaders.  Furthermore, the National Archives and Smithsonian are filled with documents containing accounts from personnel in the US Army, Federal Indian Agents, and Missionaries stating how Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, Apache, Sioux, Comanche and other tribes would settle on reservation lands and enjoy food and shelter during the winter months only to take the warpath each  spring and kill the very people who had been supplying them with the food and who these tribes had agreed to peace with as set down in Treaty terms.   Since it is a FACT that the Indians never had any distinct \\"homelands\\" in their tribal histories, they naturally felt only a temporary (if any) need to adhere to agreements whichkept them confined to one place for any length of time.      7. The view of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee seems to be that the so-called \\"glorious Horse Culture\\" of the plains tribes was \\"lost\\" because of being \\"destroyed\\" by European invaders.    FACT: The so-called \\"Horse Culture\\" of the western tribes came about as a result of the European invaders in the first place! As stated earlier in this post, the Indians caused the extinction of the prehistoric horses on this continent by hunting them as food. It was only after the Spanish brought domesticated horses to the plains and the tribes saw how these animals were used by the European invaders that the \\"horse culture\\" actually got underway.   Also, the decorative costumes and elaborately feathered war bonnets of the plains tribes didn't exist until trade with the European invaders began. There was no colored beads, no thread, no needles, no colored yarn, no colored linen, no glue, and no colored dyes among the tribes BEFORE the terrible invading Europeans arrived and used all these items as trade goods. Only then did the fanciful constumes and huge, feathered war bonnets come into being (as seen in the studio portraits of the chiefs and warriors featured in the pages of Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee).  Also, the classic tepee used by all the plains tribes didn't exist prior to the tribes obtaining the domesticated horse from European invaders. Before acquiring the horse via the terrible Europeans, the tribes lived in small animal-skin tents and temporary hovels, and they moved their belongings across the plains on the backs of pack dogs. Obviously, the amount of belongings and the complex nature of belongings would be quite limited by how much could be packed around in sacks attached to a few large dogs per family. Equally, one look at any war bonnet in any museum will certainly reveal the use of red felt, yellow/white/blue yarn, various colors of beads, glue to keep the fluffy plumes on the ends of the feathers, different types of needles needed to puncture the shaft of each feather midway in its length to string cord through, etc. None of these elements were possible PRIOR to the arrival of the terrible Europeans and all their trade goods!        In closing this post, I would like to ask both the potential reader of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" AND those who have already read it and feel that Whites were so terrible to Indians, what they think the condition of the American Indians of today would be if the European invaders had approached conflicts with the wild tribes in the same way these tribes dealt with one another? That is, if we Whites had used the tactics of the Sioux or the Comanche on all the tribes, where would their decendants be today? I can answer that question for all of you. There would be no descendants of those wild tribes at all. The terrible Europeans would have made no attempt at treaty agreements to preserve at least some of the population of each wild tribe, and we Europeans wouldn't have even considered the set up of reservations. If we followed the tactics of wild Indians instead of our own more humane ones, the only thing that we would have done would have been to wage total unrelenting warfare until all the tribes were extinct.   Think about it, and while you do, read the following titles for a TRUTHFUL and REALISTIC account of Indian/White conflict during frontier times -   \\"Three Years Among The Comanches\\", \\"Scalp Dance\\", \\"The Truth About Geronimo\\", \\"The Pawnee Indians\\", \\"The Kiowas\\", \\"Nine Years Among The Indians\\", and \\"Life Among The Apaches\\". All these excellent books are available right here at amazon.com, and all blow Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee's Politically Correct, reality-denying content right out of the water.   Read them all and THEN purchase Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, and you'll see what I mean about fiction-as-fact and fantasy-as-reality being contained in the pages of this pseudo-history book.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I feel this is a Great Album, even though i didn't like but maybe 2 tracks on the first listen. You definitely have to give this album a 2nd listen. After you do so, you'll see how great it really is. Much more mature and solid. I like the direction they went with this album, every band must evolve and mature with their music. My Favorite track is actually the first one \\"You only live once\\".
015626224X|5.0|Down and Out in Paris and London is an eye-opening book about the life of a man who lives a life of poverty. He is an Englishman who is down on his luck in a Paris slum. He works as a low servant, or plongeur, in several Paris restaurants. He only makes enough money for mere existence. In comparison to the standards of many poor people in the slums of Paris, he is well off. He continues the slum life of an English tramp, and wanders the country in search of spikes where he can spend the night in cells, as sleeping on the streets is forbidden by law. He feels he must change the system.  <br /> <br />Orwell also goes on about the degree of separation between the poor, the rich, and the tramps. He argues that there is not much difference between a man and a tramp, but the society and stereotypes have created two different men out of one man, and it all depends on the clothes he wears. If a man is wearing a business suit, he is sure to be eyed by women and respected by the businessmen he meets. If the next day the same man were to wear a filthy tramp coat, he is immediately ignored by women and businessmen and introduced to an entirely new world.  <br /> <br />Other arguments Orwell makes in this piece are the many points of view that can be taken for each situation. For example, when the main character in the story is in Paris, he believes that the conditions could not get any worse. When he arrives in London, he is quick to realize that his life was not as bad as it had become in his home country.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the honesty and the brutal truth about the culinary establishments in Paris. It was entertaining to read on about the true conditions of the lower class and what the life of one of those lowerclassmen contained on a daily basis. It has some heartwarming appeals to pathos when even the dirt poor people are able to use their money on things that are needed by character instead of by their stomach. It sheds a better light on the lower class, and the bookas a whole gives you a greater understanding for the hardships of the tramps and beggars all over the world. It shows that it is nearly impossible to escape the endless cycle of false charity and endless labor intensive job searching.  <br /> <br />From the second that I picked up this book, it was nearly impossible to put it down, and sleep usually came over me before I could take my eyes off of its pages. It is a well written piece of literature that will open your eyes to the reality of poverty. It is a heartwarming tale of beggars who feel pride in simple sidewalk drawings and expensive weekly shavings. It is a story of overcoming insurmountable obstacles.  <br /> <br />I highly suggest reading this book and it is packed full of arguments that will make you rethink the stereotypes set about a city slum. It is a place of people who have been defeated by the system, and not people who have caused their solemn fate. Orwell will keep you entertained throughout each page, and it is a book that is worth reading. Its contents are truthful, and it may open your eyes to the truths about poverty and false luxury that will cause some serious thinking at points inside the novel. It will make you rethink the heart of a slum, from a place filled with people who cause trouble to a place of broken people who have no other choice but to try and sustain themselves in the only environment possible. It will make you aware of the most feared sections of cities around the world. The people living there are people who persist with conditions and funds unimaginably bad to the eyes of the middle class, but the story of their persistence and unwillingness to become a stereotype will warm your heart. This book is definitely a top read.  <br /> <br />My best suggestion is to go out and read this book. The tramps in England will spend half their weekly income on a shave, so the purchase price of one book is hardly a sacrifice for hours of fixating reading.
B00008NG5V|5.0|It may sound like a contradiction, but On and ON is a very exciting album although it is pretty much  a laid back album.<br /><br />I remember having the same feeling when I first listened to Harper's Fight for your mind. This amazing feeling that you are about to discover something new and fresh, going through a different kind of trippin' with cool moods along with plenty of acoustic guitars and smooth vocals.<br /><br />In my opinion, On and ON is by far the best from Jack, he gets the seed planted on the first album and develop it into great tunes with much more impact ad sense of composition.<br /><br />In between dreams is a good album, but it doesn't have great numbers such as Times like these, The Horizon has been defeated, Traffic in the Sky, Wasting time, and Mediocre bad guys. By the way, it is great the slight flanger on the guitar in this song.<br /><br />All songs are great. Except the last one that is less. Maybe that's the difference in relation to In Between dreams that has some not so good tunes, making tha album a little uneven.<br /><br />On and On is a great soundtrack not only for surfing but also for people who enjoy Trekking like me, or even just lay back on a saturday afternoon on a couch watching the traffic in the sky.
B0000DDAU9|1.0|The first review of this utter turd-fest of an album was washed clean from this site.  What a shame that was, I could have saved people some money.  This album sucks.  The members of Mastadon are deaf, and real musicians everywhere call for them to be beaten to death with thier own instruments.  Some of the goons who have reviewed this album say, \\"oh, the drum tracks are a little heavy . . .\\" or some generally whiny crap like that.  The drums are not nearly as bad as the singing/screaming or the lame guitar work.  Hell, the drums prevented me from slitting my own writsts during my initial listen.  Go get yourself some Orange Goblin albums, or some Obituary (if you are into death metal), some old White Zombie or Black Sabbath Albums instead of this rotting lack of music titled \\"Remission.\\"  Hell, a Chet Atkins album is more tolerable to a music fan than this crap-tastic outing by the world's most deaf band: Mastadon.<br /><br />The Real Music Lover
B000AJJNPY|4.0|When I went to get this friggin' album I couldnt hardly wait to make the line and buy it...I wanted to unwrap it right there and just pop it in a CD player. I have both ( ) and Agaetis Byrjun, and their both dark and cool, and they...they...I dunno just had something about them...the mumbling of a fag singing about nothing.Mmm,mmm, hopelandic. When I finally heard this album, I was somewhat surprised.It was......pretty.Yea..pretty and thats it. The song Hoppipolla maid me want to run through a bunch of flower infested fields...not dont get me wrong its a great thing to be happy...but too much happyness gets a little annoying. Saeglopur is a really excellent track though, love to blast it...heh..hehe...hehehe. I wasnt too into the Andvari track ...but after a couple listens (or 6) I started to appriciate it :].If you're a sick Sigur Ros fan you NEED to own it...to others who are just finding about them...I recomment ( ) and Agaetis Byrjun as starters...and if you like them enough then buy Takk and judge it for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />P.S:Uhhh.Yea....just buy it.=D
B000B5XZLU|4.0|I don't agree with \\"Groovy...But Nothing New.\\" While Jamiroquai has an established style, he is also very experimental with different arrangements and rhythm styles which has been what established Jay K as one of my favorite artists. My favorite albums by them are Synkronized, Travelling Without Moving, and A Funk Odyssey because there were so many different styles on them, they were very innovative. Although every one of the songs on this album is catchy and quite good, I don't hear as much innovation. It is as if there is a formula he stuck to when writing this album. It kind of made me sad because a lot current pop music is falling into a \\"mush\\" stage where it all blends and sounds the same. There are so few innovators in pop music today, and although Jamiroquai's sound is the result of a combination of different music genres, this album did not show that. So I was somewhat dissapointed. It's not bad, actually it's very good by today's decaying pop \\"music\\" standards, but for Jamiroquai music standards, I think it falls slightly short. However, I still give it a four out of five.
015626224X|5.0|With Down and Out, Orwell accomplishes something remarkable. He transforms the dismal subject matter of poverty into an entertaining and fascinating story while still maintaining its didactic qualities. Orwell's ability to entertain an audience in the process of entertaining them is extraordinary. Few other authors can achieve this feat as well as Orwell, who does it in many of his writings including his most famous, 1984. Down and Out achieves this balance between didacticism and entertainment beautifully and in many ways worth noting. <br /> <br />Orwell's develops a variety of exceptional characters, each having his/her own unique story. These stories are often absurd, but at the same time, incredibly humorous. The reader is drawn in by these likable personalities. Not only do these characters entertain the reader but they also add a very personal quality to Orwell's tales of poverty. <br /> <br />Orwell's message in Down and Out does not overpower the reader but still manages to be very powerful. Using his personal experiences, Orwell comments eloquently on the nature of poverty and its effect on society. His opinions are logical and can be easily appreciated by the reader. The message leaves the reader thinking, as was most likely Orwell's intention. <br /> <br />Down and Out in Paris and London will be enjoyed by those looking for a realistic commentary on poverty and those looking to be entertained alike. It is a true masterpiece by a most talented author.
B0006B2A2E|4.0|I love this movie one, and only one, reason. It threw me a curve ball and I couldn't see it coming. I love to watch movies with a twist, but unfortunately I have nack for guessing plots and twist in a movie. Not this one. It hooked me from the word go, and I never saw it coming. I watched this movie over and over when it first came out on DVD. I still periodically watch this movie,. It never gets old. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is that it may be somewhat expensive, even for a collectors edition. Otherwise this would be a great movie to add to anyone's collection.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|I caught the reunion concert on PBS and ran out and bought the CD.  Jack Bruce's voice is chilling (listen to We're Going Wrong) on some of the cuts.  Clapton plays well (great tone) but isn't as adventuresome in his solos as he was in the past.  Still always good to hear him.  Ginger Baker sounds good too.  Highlights of the CD are Outside Woman Blues, Badge, Politician, Stormy Monday (Clapton's best soloing on this CD I think), Born Under a Bad Sign, and We're Going Wrong (far better than the studio version).  Was surprised they didn't include Tales of Brave Ulysses and Strange Brew (not sure if they actually played these tunes at the reunion shows).  All in all, a must for Cream and Clapton fans.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|I hold At The Drive In in very high regard. They more or less opened the doors of \\"indie\\" (both the genre and the community) music to me when I first heard \\"In Casino Out\\" a few years back. And it's very true that over the years ATDI have constantly evolved their sound and furthered themselves to the highest extent, and during their time together produced some of the most accomplished and beautiful music ever. While I wouldn't necessarily describe ATDI as a \\"hardcore\\" alternative to The Mars Volta, there's definitely a more rock based feeling and vibe to the band then the much more spacy atmospheric TMV. \\"Relationship Of Command\\" is definitely the rawest and fiercest At The Drive In record (rivaled only by some of their earlier EPs) and it is essential listening to anyone who takes a liking to independent music of any sort, and anyone who has become a fan of recently-spawned-ATDI bands Sparta and TMV.    There's a lot of things that make \\"Relationship Of Command\\" the best offering ATDI ever released, and the main one is Ross Robinson. While he was most noted for his production of nu-metal bands during the 90's (although he has produced everything from the Cure to Vanilla Ice), his being behind the knobs in the studio most definitely took this album to the next level. The guitars shine without being too singled out, the drums and bass give a strong backing presence without being lost or forgotten somewhere in the background, and Cedric's voice is rightfully pushed to the forefront. The sound is very raw, but clean enough for almost any fan to instantly feel at home with. This makes putting the record on and automatically getting into it an easy task, as it won't take many listens for this album to grow on you. After his production for Glassjaw, I knew that Ross would be the perfect person to bring out the best in ATDI, and honestly he does just that.    As far as talent is concerned, you'd be hard pressed to find any band out there with more talent than these five guys. While their not playing blazing, technical guitar solos, or hitting you over the head with tons of double kick or crazy drums fills, they are far removed from standard three chord patterns or simplistic nature. The band has evolved significantly since their previous EP \\"Vaya\\", and one can really tell the difference. Omar and Tony's guitar playing molds together perfectly to create a rich and hypnotic feeling on mellow hits like \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" and \\"Quarantined\\", while showing they can hit aggressively with the opener \\"Arcarsenal\\" and the electronic-rock groove of \\"Cosmonaut\\". The rhythm section of Jim (bass) and Paul (drums) is among one of the most accomplished in music, while they don't necessarily need to show off significantly for that to be seen. Paul's drumming really shines on the aforementioned \\"Cosmonaut\\" and \\"Arcarsenal\\" though. And as far as Cedric is concerned, he's never given a better vocal performance. He can go from insane yells/screams to moderate rock choruses, even melodic breaks at times. The whole vocal range is made good use of. Omar's backing vocals are also very nicely placed throughout the record.    If all that wasn't impressive enough, then simply add in the lyrical content of this album. Cedric has always been one of my favorite lyricists, and \\"Relationship Of Command\\" sees him at his finest. Just look at tracks like \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" which boasts \\"yeah, they had plans for him / they had spun the last of the pimps / corduroy, satin nailed jewelry lips / while the guillotine laughs again / dancing on the corpses' ashes.\\" Poetry has never sounded so good over music, and really it puts a lot musical acts today to shame, when most are singing about broken hearts and break ups. Cedric's lyrics are amazing in that everyone can interpret them differently, yet all agree they are among the most well written in music. One can really only appreciate the beauty of this album after you have read the words to the songs.    The album hits heavy to start, opening with \\"Arcarsenal\\", and then going right into \\"Pattern Against User\\" and \\"One Armed Scissor\\", which are all among the album's most rocking tracks. The more mellow songs are evenly sprinkled throughout the album, enough to not kill the pace, but to offer up some nice diversity throughout. There's also hints of The Mars Volta sound which Omar and Cedric would go on to play found in songs like \\"Rolodex Proaganda\\" and \\"Cosmonaut\\". The reason the album stands as well as it does though, is that every song is an engaging and different experience. One moment one will be listening to the rock-fueled vibes of \\"Sleepwalk Capsules\\", and then instantly you'll find yourself in the enthralling \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" These kind of change-ups are what make the album such a stunning accomplishment.    \\"In Casino Out\\" was the first ATDI record that I heard, and it made me a fan, but \\"Relationship of Command\\" is what kept me for life. The most unfortunate thing about this album is that it is the last piece of music the five members of ATDI ever made together. Most know that since this time they have gone on to form The Mars Volta (Cedric and Omar) and Sparta (Jim, Tony, Paul) respectively, but neither will ever evoke the same emotions in me which At The Drive In does. If you're new to this band, or if you've somehow managed to never listen to this cd before (highly unlikely I'm sure), then this is a must own. Everything about \\"Relationship Of Command\\" is stunning, from its production, to its musical performance, and right down to its lyrics. At The Drive In really went out in high fashion, and I guess if you're going to go, then this is the way to do it. Such a shame, but at least we have all this great music to remember them by. Check out the new bands, and get this immediately. \\"Dancing On The Corpses' Ashes.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the second time in my life, that I've bought a boxed set of a tv-series. Usually I NEVER watch stuff like that more than once, but this is an exception;<br /><br />Firefly has it all! Great plots, wonderful 3 dimensional characters, surprises and original plot twists. I haven't enjoyed a tv-series as much since \\"Black Books\\".<br /><br />Think of a mixture between a western and Star Wars and then add great acting, superior storytelling and really interesting human relations. Then add a dash of swashbuckling spaceship action and a bucket-full of cool oneliners, and this is what you get. Great entertainment. MAKE MORE EPISODES!!! WE WANT THEM!!!
B000BP86OG|4.0|Maybe I can appreciate this album more than other Darkness fans because I bought this one first.  I didn't have any expectations when I put \\"One Way Ticket\\" into my CD player, and I was totally blown away.  I think both records are amazing, each in their own way.  They are very different from each other and should be judged individually. <br /> <br />For starters, \\"One Way Ticket To Hell...And Back\\" is a title that Spinal Tap must be jealous of.  It's pure \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" genius.  If the music wasn't so well-written and performed, this album would be a joke, but instead it's almost an instant classic.  I say it's \\"almost\\" a classic because there are a couple of misses here.  \\"Hazel Eyes,\\" and \\"English Country Garden\\" are used to my \\"skip\\" button being pushed.  Overall, though, I think \\"One Way Ticket\\" is absolutely outstanding. <br /> <br />Standout tracks for me are:  \\"One Way Ticket,\\" \\"Knockers,\\" \\"Is It Just Me,\\" \\"Dinner Lady Arms,\\" \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time,\\" and \\"Bald.\\"  \\"Bald\\" is by far the best song on the album. <br /> <br />Well, that's my two cents.  I can't wait for the next Darkness record.  I'm sure they will eventually release an album that will go down in rock 'n' roll history as a classic.  Don't be surprised if they come up with the next \\"Back In Black.\\"  Mark my words.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|What were they thinking??!! Among other songs from the movie not on this CD is the wonderfull and stirring version of \\"The Show Must Go On\\" It is full of lush strings and emotion, simply a brilliant arrangement of a brilliant song. I brought this CD when it first came out, and was SO very disapointed that this track in particular was omitted!!  That and the fact it is not the sound track off the film is the reason I have only given this CD a 3 star rating. However it is still an excellent CD, and well worth a listen. My recomendation would be to skip buying both CDs, and purchase the double DVD instead! It is a visual and audio feast not to be missed!(best viewed on a very large screen).  Of course I also have the DVD now, so I am not buying the second CD..... Do the marketers think I'm that big a sucker??!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original, axe-murdered, Firefly TV show and was very eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD. Is it as good as the TV show?<br /><br />Trick question. TV allows for the episodic evolution of characters, and when you have nine so expertly sketched and acted as the cast of Firefly, that space is really key to the series. In a movie, you have 2 hrs -- give or more usually take -- which means hyper-compression, and a necessity to focus on only a very few arcs. But it also allows for some incredibly big thrills, chills, and explosions along the way.<br /><br />River and Mal are given center stage, along with the Reavers story, and creative mastermind Joss Whedon uses his trademark brilliant dialog, brutalizing emotional content, and jaw-dropping set pieces to full effect, every bit as funny, terrifying, and surprising as I've come to (happily) expect.<br /><br />The only caveat I would give is that people unfamiliar with the Firefly TV show should watch it. They don't have to do it first, but it will certainly magnify the weight of the movie if they do so at some point. Whether Serenity introduces them to Firefly or vice versa, its definitely a journey worth taking and characters worth experiencing.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|I was never a huge Daredevil fan, although I did enjoy Frank Miller's run on the title from many years ago, but I did like the theatrical version of Daredevil (the movie) and was interested in seeing the director's cut.<br /><br />In short, this version fixes some problems I had with the original, leaves some the way they were, and introduces others.<br /><br />I liked the initial violence of the Kingping, which served to increase his threat level considerably. The choice of removing the love seen with Elektra seemed to turn into cliche, where the original version was a nice change from the usual all-sacrificing hero. The sub-plot of the murder, while showing more of the lawyer side of Matt Murdock, didn't seem that inspired and didn't seem to serve the core story (just complicate it).<br /><br />It would have been nice to see Bullseye introduced while breaking out of prison, headaches and all, and to have saved a Kingpin showdown for a sequel, letting the Bulleye showdown really serve as an immediate climax to the events with Elektra.<br /><br />The cast was excellent and I found myself enjoying Affleck as Daredevil -- definitely my favorite role of his to date. Garner, while not particularly Greek, did a good job, and Favreau was simply outstanding. Farrel was neither here nor there, over the top but not particularly dangerous.<br /><br />The CGI problems with the virtual Daredevil remain from the theatrical release, but the movie looks great as a whole, and while I didn't find this version better, I found it overall to be just as good as the theatrical release and definitely something worth adding to the collection.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|When I first saw Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, I thought that it was an outstanding movie. I rated it 4/5 stars here on Amazon. My friend on the other hand thought that it was rather pathetic. Looking back at my review that I wrote some years ago I have to agree that 4/5 is being too generous. Spirits Within is only a 3 star movie at best. It amazing how hype can warp someone's mind.  <br /> <br />Now there's Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Thank God, it's not about space marines and plant-lovers. Instead it is a sequel  to FF7 that brings Cloud's story to closure. I think it is better to think of this \\"movie\\" as a \\"belated FMV\\" or \\"the REAL FMV that  one was supposed to see after beating FF7\\". As a movie, as film, as cinema, it downright flops. <br /> <br />The name Final Fantasy is synonymous with several things: <br />Great characters/ character development (Cloud, Aeris, Kefka, Sephiroth, Vivi, etc.)  <br />Great graphics (even the NES Final Fantasies had good graphics for their time) <br />Great music (Thank you Nobuo Uematsu) <br />Great plot/storyline (Final Fantasy 6, 7, 9 and 10) <br />Unfortunately, this \\"movie\\" only masters two of those. <br /> <br />The graphics in this \\"movie\\" are outstanding! And I thought they were good in Spirits Within, but Advent Children raises the bar.  <br /> <br />And I was soooo happy to see that Nobuo Uematsu took the helm in the music department. You'll get to hear all sorts of variations of popular tunes from the FF7 game in this \\"movie\\". Yes, there is a variation of \\"One-Winged Angel\\".  <br /> <br />But the parts where Advent Children fails is in the character development and storyline. If someone never played FF7, they will have no clue who Cloud is, why Aeris is important and why Sephiroth is the bad guy. As for the storyline, I thought that the storyline for the actual game FF7 was great . . . but also dreadfully confusing, especially towards the end. And if you don't have a good grasp of things to begin with,how can one possibly understand what is going on in Advent Children? The whole Geostigma thing made no sense to me as did the importance of \\"Mother's neck\\".  <br /> <br />*sigh* If only Square had a computer program that could crank out storylines as good as the graphics.  <br /> <br />But my biggest problem with the \\"movie\\" was the fight scenes. Cloud's swords and motorcycle LOOK awesome, but just about every fight scene jerks around as if two kids were fighting with a VCR remote: one kid hitting the slow-motion button and the other kid alternately pressing the Play and Fast Forward button.  <br />But most ridiculous is how everybody flies around like Superman, climbs the sides of buildings like Spiderman, and, well, pretty much give all the laws of physics the middle finger.  <br />Most ridiculous is the scene where there is this REUNION (of Cloud and Co., ironically) and they each take turns tossing Cloud hundreds of feet into the air. <br /> <br />As nostalgiac FMV, Advent Children will make you feel that Cloud's story has finally come to an agreeable end, but as movie? I think not!

B00000G3PA|5.0|i have read a lot of reviews, and have to disagree with the criticisms of the scientific side of 'armageddon'. it is a FILM. a film people. infact, my favourite film. the acting is fantastic, gripping storyline, and extremely emotional, and why does it matter if the rocket is the wrong size to what it should be? a fantastic cast and my favourite film of all time - never gets boring.
B0007WZURY|4.0|Zuckerzeit (\\"Sugar Era\\") proves to be a classic upon first listen. The album was a progressive move forward for Roedelius and Moebius who began to compose with rhythmic structures by way of an early drum machine and a stronger emphasis on harmony, a great departure from \\"Cluster II\\". What results is a fresh and warm analog experience which many to this very day are trying to recapture but so very few do. Re-mastering seems to have been well done.<br /><br />I wonder why this release is not as well known as the classic \\"Autobahn\\" considering they both came out in 1974.
B00009P1OD|4.0|One of Chicago's greatest efforts. I still love the album today from an artistic standpoint. However, ever since 1970 I've wondered why this album has such a incredibly distant, super-compressed, mid-range sound with absolutely no bass or dynamic range? Was it intentional?
1932907009|5.0|This is the second screenwriting book that I purchased, but it will be the last one.  In his screenwriting primer, Blake Synder, successful screenwriter who has sold million dollar screenplays, has made learning to write a screenplay fun. He breaks down the steps so that beginners like me can understand the formula in which movies are made no matter what the genre.  This book also motivated me to actually write! I feel as though I carry the author with me personally whenever I open up my book to review a step.  By the language of the book, I can tell that Blake is a fun guy who knows his craft inside and out, yet doesn't take himself too seriously.  He encourages the aspiring screenwriters to have fun with the process and provides the necessary step by step tools as a check and balance for the writer as they structure their story.  This book is a MUST HAVE tool for every aspiring writer and professional.  Blake provides examples of multi million dollar box office movies that follow his formula as well as show what not to do by citing examples in actual movies.  The book is very reader friendly and filled with humor and many examples. I read the book in 2 days! This book guides the writer from the title of their movie to the final scene.   <br />If you only purchase one screenwriter book, Let this be the one you purchase. It is compact, to the point and provides great motivation to write! It could be the best investment of a lifetime when you sell that script!!!! <br />From a very satisfied customer
B000AY74OG|5.0|This movie was really entertaining. It was really good. I think people of all ages should see the movie. It is truley a good Family film. It stars some very known Actors in it like, ben Stiller, Chris Rock, david Schwimmer & jada Pinkette Smith. This movie is about four spoiled animals, A Zebra, Lion, Hippo & A Gariffe, who have know idea what it is like in the wild. When Marty(The Zebra, Rock) wants to go to the wild because he is bored with the zoo life runs away the other three animals go looking for him. When they find him they end up getting Tranqulized and end up on a ship to africa. When Four penguins hijack the boat they are on they end up on an Island called Madagascar. can these Four Friends survive without thier papering. I hope so. The dvd also has a mini movie that stars the madagascar penguins. It's a little cute cartoon. this is a really Good movie. I also thought the animals they picked were fun. This is a really enjoyable movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do<br /><br />If you liked This Movie Check out The Madagascar Soundtrack.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is the kind of movie that the Star Wars prequals should have been.

The film works as the perfect end to a wonderful series and I will be cherishing both in my DVD library for years to come.
B000AL730O|5.0|Since I bought this album on it's release date it hasn't left my CD player!!!! It's that good...every single song!!!!! <br />The songs that really stand out for me are Jenny Wren, English Tea, Too Much Rain and This Never Happened Before. <br />They're so good that they would not be out of place on any Beatles album. <br />There are songs in which minor chords are used which is great...it leaves you surprised. <br />I like to listen to what I call \\"MUSIC WITH GUTS\\" which in my mind means someone that will take chances. <br />This whole album signifies that.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd remain and will remain for years to come, one of the best bands ever and one of the best experiences for music listeners everywhere. \\"Echoes\\" puts some of their biggest and best tracks together, but leaves some great gems out. I was wondering where \\"Careful with the axe, Eugene\\", \\"Have a Cigar\\", and \\"Breathe\\" were, but it doesn't matter. All of their great albums are well represented here, even their not so great ones. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Meddle\\", \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", \\"The Division Bell\\", they're all here. Even the older albums with Syd Barrett, who sings in \\"Bike\\", \\"Jugband Blues\\", \\"See Emily Play\\" and \\"Astronomy Domine\\". <br />The greatest songs they've ever released, with chilling harmonies and symphonies, awesome guitar, and amazing lyrics, like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Money\\", are all here, and also present are their brilliant very-long musical masterpieces, like \\"Echoes\\", \\"Sheep\\", and \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (pts. 1-7)\\". <br />If you are a Pink Floyd fan, or a fan of newer music like Radiohead, get Echoes.
6305508550|5.0|This film definitely captures the essence of white collar angst, Steven Root's performance as the lovable Milton, who no longer recieves a paycheck but still calls his cubicle home and is anal retentive when it comes to his red stapler, is Oscar worthy.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The cat returns is all about trusting yourself no matter what, it is a confidance booster and is filled with many funny and touching senes. <br /> <br />The cat returns was released in 2002 but its release was overshadowed by sprited away and so did not recive the publicity it was due.  <br />This movie is suitable for all ages and I highly recomend it for younger viewers who are questioning themselves and do not have trust in their own judgement.  <br /> <br />The whole family will love this picture, it is somthing I can watch over and over again, the animation is very smooth and the voices fit the characters perfectly, this is quite possably one of the only anime movies that I have not had the need to watch with subtitles instead of the americanized voice overs because the voice acters did a terific job and were cast so well. <br /> <br />The movie caries the lession that if you act with your heart and you trust yourself everything will work out. its a lession most children and some adults (such as myself) need to learn/relearn. <br /> <br />once again I highly recomend this movie.
B00005JOGU|4.0|\\"Capote\\" focuses on the time period when the author was researching \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  Truman Capote was already a renowned author in 1959; however, the book would change his career and alter how non-fiction was written and perceived.  Clearly, being involved with that book changed Capote's life personally as well.  The film commences with the murder of the Clutter family in the tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas.  The murder was particularly brutal and made news across the country, which is how Truman Capote stumbled across the story.  Capote travels to Kansas with his friend, Harper Lee, hoping to write a story for the New Yorker.  Obtaining information was slow-going at first, as he was competing with other media.  However, Capote and Lee used their charms to make friends with local officials.  Eventually, Capote would become friends with one of the murderers - Perry Smith - as well.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely stellar in \\"Capote\\": it's really an \\"actor's movie.\\"  Philip Seymour Hoffman has been outstanding in many movies (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Magnolia, Happiness), but playing Truman Capote has finally established him as a star.  He nails the nasally whine of Capote but also captures a deeper essence; after a few minutes on screen, he becomes the author, without question.  Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, almost unrecognizable in a prim hairstyle and drab librarian-style clothing, is also terrific.  I hope this will lead to another Oscar nomination for her.  However, the real find here is Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.  I've been a fan of his for years, especially his flamboyant work in \\"Traffic.\\"  He's finally found a meaty role worthy of his talent.<br /><br />The final star of \\"Capote\\" is the screenplay; it's a literate movie for certain.  The witty script is filled with the kind of bon mots and clever quips Truman Capote himself so often made in television interviews.  The film recreates the 1960s literary scene in all its sexy vibrance.  However, for all its cleverness, the screenplay is not as impactful as one would hope.  \\"In Cold Blood\\" arguably is one of the best works of non-fiction ever, and the 1967 movie adaptation was brilliantly stark and mean.  Given the source material, I expected \\"Capote\\" to be a bit more affecting.  The conflicted relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting, but it's also strangely unmoving here.  Some viewers may prefer that a film that depicts morality in so many shades or gray remain a bit distant, but I wanted some catharsis.  Nevertheless, \\"Capote\\" is a very good movie with outstanding writing and acting.verness, the screenplay is not as impactful as one would hope.  \\"In Cold Blood\\" arguably is one of the best works of non-fiction ever, and the 1967 movie adaptation was brilliantly stark and mean.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|being a big fan of the band death cab for cutie, i was really looking forward to their new album, and was slightly disappointed. it's not that it isnt good, its just that its not like what death cab usually does. in this new album you'll find 11 new songs with many different types of music. for example on a few tracks, like i will follow you into the dark, you'll find gibbard by himself with an acoustic guitar. and on other tracks, many others, you'll find a lot of eletric beats and such, wich is not like what death cab would normally do. i guess that the side project of gibbard's, the postal service, really influenced this album, with it being all electric. i cant say that i dont enjoy this cd because i do listen to it from time to time, but i would rather stick with old favorites, like we have the facts and we're voting yes. so if you were really into the postal service you will enjoy this cd, and if you would rather stick with the old death cab, you might find this cd just collecting dust.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|1 - People are taking it WAY too seriously.  Most of the songs are great satire.  Some people are complaining about the pop quality in the \\"party\\" section of B.Y.O.B.  SOAD has not \\"sold out\\" okay?  it is a jab at the status quo. In addition, I don't think they are singing about any band member's \\"member\\" in \\"Cigaro\\".  It is a metaphor for corporate bigwig 'tude, dude. <br />2 - SOAD has a new sound in this album.  They do not sound like they did when they started. They do not sound like Metallica or Korn or Slipknot or any other nu-metal out there right now.  That is a good thing since it really is boring when everyone starts sounding alike, dontcha think?. As musicians they have improved and their production is tighter.  The compositions are more complex. <br /> <br />They sound only like themselves. <br /> <br />Originality gets five from me.  I'm surprised they got such a positive response from the mainstream.  I guess we will be seeing many SOAD \\"clones\\" out there in the future (sniff).
B000AP04L0|4.0|Ofiice Space is one of the best movies of all time, with memerable quotes and scenes you could watch over and over again it's no wonder why this movie is so good. Office Space is about a guy named Peter who hates his job, and when he gets hypnotized into being completely relaxed, he decides to just do whatever he wants to and not go to work. This leads to him getting a promotion and his two co-worker friends losing their jobs, which ultimately leads to them coming up with a plan to steal money from the evil place they work at.  <br />    <br />This dvd is called a special edition, so hearing this i went out and picked it up only to discover not many special features are found on this discc. There is a cool retrospective \\"look back\\" documentary, which i enjoyed, but other than that all there is is a set of really short, but sometimes funny, deleted scenes. so, why even buy this dvd? well, aside from the lack of special features the movie is still one of the best, so if you dont already have the old dvd i suggest you buy this dvd, but if you do already have the old dvd then i would say to just skip out on this becuase you'll be basically buying the same thing twice.
B000BEZPQE|3.0|I think the reason I enjoy Slipknot is the same as why I always look at the five car pile-up accident on the freeway.  For some reason, they have the same entertainment value for me.  They wear fright masks and wield their instruments like chainsaws, and I can't NOT look. <br /> <br />Their new live album is a good value for their fans.  What it lacks in production value it makes up for in sheer energy.  The percussion is about the best I have ever heard on a live album.  The vocals, however, suffer due to the fact that Corey sounds like, ...ummm... he is singing while wearing a MASK! <br /> <br />Gee, I wonder why the studio vocals don't sound that way?  Hmmmm.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Having received the Season 1 box set of Smallville for Christmas, I have mentally revisited the early days of the WB hit-show. This season was undoubtedly the best!  <br /> <br />The DVD is a worthwhile purchase (even at $115 Australian), with my favourite additional feature being a glimpse into Chloe's personal computer files. I was disappointed that her \\"Wall of Weird\\" was not exactly like the cluttered noticeboard in her Torch office, but, rather, a series of profiles and data. However, I enjoyed searching through her \\"Recycling Bin\\" and picture files. <br /> <br />There are also numerous TORCH articles, which I intend to read.  <br /> <br />As for the episodes, they are virtually impossible to tire of! Neither the anticipation nor vibrance wears off, and every single scene is highly entertaining! I have found that with comedies, sitcoms in particular, episodes are one-off affairs, where the novelty wears off after the first time. This is also the case with serious dramas, where you lose the sense of expectancy and suspense. Other shows are just plain boring after seeing it once through, especially when the dialogue is dull.  <br /> <br />Smallville has a consistently captivating script with wit and sentiment. Every scene has a point to it and the viewer is kept incredibly interested until the issue at hand has been resolved. I, personally, have found that watching re-runs is an insightful pastime, as you can pinpoint clues that you may have missed the first time. You also begin to realise the reasons for the characters' actions and behaviour. It is always a pleasure to revisit the humourous one-liners, often delivered by either Chloe or Lex.  <br /> <br />Here in Australia, we have just commenced Season 3, which has definitely heightened the action-element of the show and it is perhaps more interesting than ever. I feel that there is a certain poignancy, though, correlating only with Season 1, which brings it a sense of nostalgia that is irreplacable and inimitable.  <br />

That is sadly true on DINNER AT EIGHT and AFTER THE THIN MAN among other old movies issued by Warner Bros. but the print of BRINGING UP BABY is near flawless, you rarely seen movies from the 30's virtually scratch-free like this!! Perhaps that reviewer has the earlier edition and I've seen a newer release (I'm reviewing the slipcover version)  but the picture quality here is fantastic and I am very hard to please.<br /><br />This delightful 102 minute movie (a good 20 minutes longer than many comedies from the era) flies by in this wacky tale of a giddy young socialite who makes a professor's life a nightmare for 24 hours.  Katharine Hepburn is so delightful as the dizzy heiress and she really deserves praise for keeping the pace of her performance at the same frantic level throughout the movie and not slipping.  Cary Grant so effectively captures the nerdy essence of the professor it's almost as big a surprise to us as it is for Hepburn's Susan that he is quite the hearthrob once the glasses come off.  The supporting cast is wonderful too, most notably that grande dame of characters, May Robson, as Susan's pompous aunt and Charlie Ruggles as her easily confused friend.  Fritz Field is also memorable as the pyscharist whose path keeps crossing Susan's.<br /><br />This DVD is a special two disc set which in addition to featuring trailers to several Howard Hawks films, it includes a vintage television documentary on the great director.  And then there's an extraordinary documentary on Cary Grant \\"A Class Apart\\" featuring some fantastic vintage candid film footage and interviews with two of Grant's wives (Betsy Drake might make you drop your drink with her blunt response to gay rumors about Grant!!)  If that's not enough there are two wonderful bonuses to make this seem like a night at the movies in 1938 - a hilarious Warners Technicolor cartoon A STAR IS HATCHED which features a hen heroine in this spoof of \\"star-struck girl goes to Hollywood\\" tales which features wonderful cartoon characters of everyone from John Barrymore to Mae West (our poultry princess even imitates Hepburn, rah-lee she does!!) and a very rare Technicolor musical short CAMPUS CINDERELLA from that year starring the delightful Penny Singleton only months away from stardom as \\"Blondie\\" (she's a brunette here) and keep your eyes open for Susan Hayward in a bit in a blue swimsuit.<br /><br />This is a near perfect packaging of a classic film.  Let's hope future gems from the golden era will packaged with such loving care.'s not enough there are two wonderful bonuses to make this seem like a night at the movies in 1938 - a hilarious Warners Technicolor cartoon A STAR IS HATCHED which features a hen heroine in this spoof of \\"star-struck girl goes to Hollywood\\" tales which features wonderful cartoon characters of everyone from John Barrymore to Mae West (our poultry princess even imitates Hepburn, rah-lee she does!!) and a very rare Technicolor musical short CAMPUS CINDERELLA from that year starring the delightful Penny Singleton only months away from stardom as \\"Blondie\\" (she's a brunette here) and keep your eyes open for Susan Hayward in a bit in a blue swimsuit.   <br /> <br />This is a near perfect packaging of a classic film.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|While Is This It and Room on Fire were both fine examples of the talent of The Strokes, First Impressions of Earth represents a slight change in style.  Don't get me wrong, most critics who don't know the first thing about music are quick to call it a huge change, but thats because they don't know anything about The Strokes. New to this cd is Julians voice.  Less mumbling, more singing.  I'd say thats a good change.  New to this cd are guitar solos.  In modern rock the guitar solo is nearly extinct and its nice to hear a band that appreciates what they can say with their music outside the lyrics.  Again, a good change.   <br />The Strokes can speak without talking better than most and do a fine job of it on First Impressions.  From Juicebox's fierce bass line, to the strings complimenting Julian in Ask Me Anything to the guitar solo in Vision of Division; The Strokes are able to express themselves through their sound.   <br />In a review I read the critic said \\"gone is that irresistable analog sound where the band seemed to hit your ears all at once.\\"  To him I say, have you listened to the cd?  Tracks like Heart in a Cage, Razorblade, and Vision of Division are overwhelming to take in all at once.  Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. compliment each other better than any other guitar players I've ever heard.   <br />The beauty of this album along with all Strokes music is the different parts to listen to.  In order to fully appreciate everything they do I challenge listeners and critics to listen to each instruent seperately.  This is goig to take you 5 passes through the cd to cover the vocals, each guitar, the bass, and the drums.  Next, listen to the cd one more time as a whole and how the seperate parts compliment each other.  The Strokes are musicians first, rock stars second, and above all that is evident on First Impressions.  They use complicated subivisions of beats to mix everything together that any musician will truly appreciate.   <br />To the criticsof the Strokes: I challenge your musical background.  You are journlists who couldn't land a better job than being forced to listen to a band in order to get published.  Of course you are going to be bitter... its your job.  Thats no way to listen to an album.  Sit back, relax, go into it with an open mind, and the Strokes will not fail to impress.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />When I was little I remember watching this movie with my family and friends and I still even remember so much of the detail. Today in our society there are plenty of negative influences once your kids, or any kid gets into middle school or earlier, but the best brain growth is even before that. Why not take advantage of this time and get them something wonderful and positive and affirming!?!!! This is such a great story and it and the songs will stick with your children or any children giving them something to sing and play with. Not only that, but this is the type of movie that can be watched over and over again for enjoyment to give your kids simply something to do! I highly recommend this classic movie to anyone with kids or as a gift to anyone that has them! I know I benefited, my friends did, and the kids in your life will too...and the adults :)<br /><br />I hoped you liked my review and found it useful!!!!<br /><br />Sam Kochel
B0000VD04M|5.0|In a wacky B-movie Hollywood of the mid 1950's, Johnny Depp is Ed Wood, a young, goofy optimist who dreams of directing movies.  Despite his fondness for wacky horror and sci-fi stories (and having NO talent whatsoever), Wood wiggles his way into Hollywood, and cranks out one cheesy horror/sci-fi movie after another.  Ed sees his meal-ticket when he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi; now an elderly, desperate morphine addict.  Quick for his next fix, Lugosi goes to work for Wood, and the two begin an actor-director partnership together.  A sweet, gentle (and probably fictionalized) bond forms between Wood and Lugosi. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp is so brilliant in this role, he really captures Wood's naive optimism.  This may also be the only film where you actually see him smile!  However, it's Martin Landau (as Lugosi) that gives the story its biggest jolts of energy (or perhaps it's just hearing old people swear that always make me laugh).  Landau easily steals the movie, having won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.  What ultimately makes this film a masterpiece is the impeccable reproduction and costume design of the 1950s, as well as the crisp black-and-white cinematography.  It really transports you back to those clean-cut, wide-eyed days. <br /> <br />The entire cast is incredible.  The music score by Howard Shore is perfect for its period, making much use of the theremin.  The detail to which this movie goes in re-creating Wood's movies are amazing, but you'll also be laughing at how awful they were.  If you love 1950s B-movies, this film will double as a documentary of how those silly films were made back then, the film functions quite well as a time warp.  \\"Ed Wood\\" may be trying to tell a story of how it FEELS to be in the middle of the 1950s more than anything else, and that's what draws so many to the film over and over again.  Like \\"American Graffiti,\\" \\"Stand By Me,\\" and \\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\\" this film perfectly captures the images, sounds and attitudes of the era it idealizes. <br /> <br />If you have high expectations whenever you purchase a DVD that's labeled \\"Collector's Edition,\\" you may be mildly disappointed here.  There are some behind-the-scenes goodies on the disc, but they are all short in length.  The film transfer and sound quality are exceptional, though.  There are also commentary tracks as well. <br />

B00005JOIF|4.0|Eleven Israeli athletes are kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The situation does not end well and all of the athletes are killed. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier discusses a response, a solution, with her closest advisors. Ultimately, they decide to use force, to show Israel is not weak. They contact Avner (Eric Bana), a former Mossad agent, and ask him to lead a team of men to kill the eleven Palestinians responsible for Munich. His team includes: Steve (Daniel Craig), an Afrikaner adept with cars, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the `cleaner', Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), a toymaker who works with explosives, and Hans (Hanns Zischler), a documents expert. As they fulfill their missions, their doubts grow and the level of danger increases.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner, is a powerful, challenging film.<br /><br />Ostensibly a thriller, the film devotes a significant amount of time addressing the moral issues of \\"an eye for an eye\\". As the death toll rises, Avner's team has thoughtful discussions about the goals and consequences of their missions. Each target is an individual mission, some are easier than others, but as they set about their jobs, Avner's team works very hard to ensure there is little collateral damage. One target lives with his wife and daughter in Paris and the team quickly aborts the mission when they realize the daughter has returned home unexpectedly. Much of their discussion centers on the moral issues at stake.<br /><br />Initially, the people who planned Munich, stay in the open, living their normal lives, because they are viewed as heroes within their community. This raises the ire of the team of Israeli assassins. After they take out their first target, receiving no mention in the news, Avner and his team realize they will have to use different methods, methods designed to attract attention and send a message to the community. But these will also be more dangerous, making it more difficult to prevent collateral damage. Their actions begin to form a circle of problems and solutions, solutions and problems.<br /><br />This circle is also a topic of discussion. As their missions become successful, the Palestinians retaliate. When will the cycle end? Can it ever end if they are successful with all eleven targets? For each target they remove, another takes their place. At one point, they are even dispatched to take out the replacement. The Palestinians also attack new targets, killing innocent people. All of this begins to weigh heavily on the team, affecting them in different ways.<br /><br />Spielberg does an excellent job of presenting arguments for both sides without forsaking the tenants of a motion picture. The episodic nature of the film aids in this process, allowing the director to present thriller like elements book ended with segments of discussion, introspection, guilt. After each target, there is a natural period of less activity as they wait for the next target, plan for the next mission. As they sit. And wait. And wait. Their minds naturally begin to wander and focus on other things. And they talk. Allowing the characters, and the filmmakers, to discuss the various aspects of their missions. Each member of the team is committed to the cause to varying degrees. All agree that a response is necessary, but Steve (Craig) seems to be the only one who doesn't have any objections to their current task.<br /><br />As they progress in their missions, work further up the food chain, each of the team members deals with their problems in a different way. Some become depressed, some argue and fight, some shut down. Ultimately, it rips some of them apart.<br /><br />Avner (Eric Bana) has deep misgivings about it. Bana turns in his best performance as the leader of the group. On the one hand, he has nightmares about the deaths of the athletes, on the other he has moral problems with their mission to assassinate others. Hespends a lot of time reflecting, but those nightmares ultimately help him continue, to move forward. As the team leader, he is unable to show much of the doubt he has to his team, he must show them he is strong. One of the methods he uses to vent his frustration is to cook large meals for the team, during their periods of inactivity. As the danger level mounts, he also becomes more and more paranoid, suspecting at one point that the government he works for may have targeted his family. His performance portrays the majority of these emotions without words, allowing his actions to speak for or thinly disguise his emotions.<br /><br />The rest of the team is also very good. Geoffrey Rush plays Avner's government contact or handler, his contact with a government who claims he doesn't exist. Mathieu Kassovitz (\\"Amelie\\"'s boyfriend), Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler are all good, showing their character's moral objections in their own ways. At first, I had some problems with Daniel Craig's (\\"Layer Cake\\", the new James Bond) portrayal of Steve. I just didn't get what he was trying to do, his accent was just plain strange. Then, someone refers to his character as \\"Afrikaner\\" and it all made sense. His character works, but it is the least interesting because Steve is the least conflicted about their goals.<br /><br />What Spielberg does is very interesting. He has created a film with suspenseful elements, in an international setting, along the lines of \\"The Bourne Identity\\" or \\"Three Days of the Condor\\". Then he blends in political elements, discussions of ideology, morality and more. It shouldn't work. You would think it might be boring. But it does work. And I was never bored for the 165 minutes the film ran. It is a bit of a conundrum that the film should work.<br /><br />Much like the conundrum Avner and his team face every day of their mission.ate others.

B0000AQS0F|3.0|While the stories and characters are engaging enough, all the extra sex scenes and nudity (which are many!) are not needed to enhance the series. On the contrary they hinder it. It is soft porn and I wish others would point this out! When I see a Sfi-fi series, I just want to see a good Sci-Fi story, not sex. Sure people will have sex in the future, but this usually happens behind CLOSED doors. There is alot of cussing also, and you would think in the future, we could think of more intelligent words to replace swear words. Everyone does not talk like this, or like to watch the sex scenes. Why didn't anyone else mention this before I went out to buy this? We are NOT going to keep this for this reason alone. If there were not so much of this, we would keep it and watch it again. I will say that if you watch this, you will really take a liking to some of the characters and despise others. It is kinda a sad story, yet one of hope. It is scary too. I mean, I dread a future where prostitutes are glorified as respectable Career workers as this series portrays.
B00003CX95|4.0|This one probably show why mel gibson was among the top actor yet only making a few film,s cause film feel like this prove the be worthly enought to earn oscar which i think it deserve, however i dislike some plot, yes the bloodly, maniac viloance is a bit over the top, but sometime just a bit over do, most cast of the film aren't doing good acting, just mel and the engliand king who really stand out acting rest is consider poor performance, so there's you having still one of memorable film out there even after decade is out.
0307276902|5.0|Simply amazing.  This is a great read, something you won't want to put down. James Frey has done an amazing job of showing the true life story of an addict on the road to recovery!  A must read!  Not two minutes after finishing I started 'My Friend Leonard'(the sequel)- A Million Little Pieces is a great read for everyone!
B00006RCNW|5.0|To say that I view anything from the F/X network as suspect would probably be an understatement.  It's probably my belief that Fox tends to overhype even the worst of what it does.  Upon seeing reviews of The Shield, instead of giving it a shot, I counted it's cutting-edge and breakthrough monikers as a result of using profanity and showing more skin than what we would see on the big networks.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  The characters are strong and the characters are deep.  The pure cinematic effect of the camera work are more in line with what you see on the big screen than your normal cop show.  The racial tension is palpable and no one is a clear cut good or bad guy.  It's good to see a show dealing in shades of gray rather than just plain good and evil, because we all know the world is never really a clear cut measure of right and wrong.  There's something to be said for the series putting you right there in the mix and being forced to make your own call as to who was right in each situation and then wondering if your gut reaction is really what you had hoped it would be.<br /><br />I won't go into storylines or any synopsis, because that's not what I look for in a review.  If you want to get sucked up into a show and not leave the house until the last disc has played then this is one for you.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Holy bejeusus, I've been waiting for this album with bated breath for over two years now, and I finally got it the day it came out (Tuesday)....holy CRAP I'm so flipping glad that Julian's vocals are up front, they're so powerful on Juicebox! <br /> <br />There are only two real \\"lows\\" on the album in my opinion, and those are the first half of the song \\"15 Minutes\\", and I'm not exactly impressed with \\"On The Other Side\\" (although the lyrics are great and the both are definitely growing on me). <br /> <br />High points?  Where do I begin? <br /> <br />The album opener, \\"You Only Live Once\\", is just superb, old-school Strokes with an intro to make you tap your feet, once you get past the oddness of \\"Juicebox\\", its genius comes out, and other moments of brilliance show themselves on nearly every track of the album (\\"Razorblade\\", \\"Heart In A Cage\\", \\"Red Light\\").  In my opinion, this is their strongest album lyrically, and it caught my attention more quickly than Room on Fire did, possibly even Is This It as well.   <br /> <br />It does lapse into facelessness once or twice, but it definitely pulls itself out of the gutter and kicks serious ass more often than not.  This will be on heavy rotation in my iPod for years to come.   <br /> <br />The Strokes=GODS

B0007OCG4W|5.0|It takes a lot of nerve to share a relationship with someone and then, without warning, throw it right back in their face. Emotions flare, terrible words are spoken, and attitudes become difficult to seeth, motivating both parties to take revenge on one another in some form. Unfolding events can be disastrous, and can sometimes involve other people who may or may not have motives of their own.    That is the electric energy of \\"Closer,\\" a film so emotionally powerful but so painfully honest that it can polarize your reactions to it. It involves four attractive people who are unattractive on the inside. They are probably unaware of this, and when they all become submerged in a messy predicament, their inner selves are graphically revealed. They are darkly sadistic, articulate in their manners, and sufficient in animosity. These four individuals are normal, everyday people just like the rest of us. They have problems just like we do, and we are forced to remain entangled with their lives. Rarely does a film inadvertently use its characters for a long-lasting impact, and rarely does a movie connect so effortlessly with the audience.    Alice (Natalie Portman) and Daniel (Jude Law) lock eyes while walking towards each other on a London street. Alice, focused on putting her flirting skills to good use and still used to the fact that American traffic comes from the left, is hit by a taxi cab. When she comes to her senses a number of seconds later, having sustained a few cuts, she sees Daniel standing over her, smiles, and she says, \\"Hello, stranger.\\"     A following sequence shows the two sitting in a hospital waiting room, riding on a bus, taking a stroll through a park, and chatting about who they are. Alice is a stripper, newly arrived in London, who fled New York City to escape a bad relationship. Daniel is a struggling novelist who writes obituaries, or \\"the Siberia of journalism.\\" Alice says that she is into meeting new people and finding a new profession. They hitif off, roughly at first, and eventually move in together.    Time passes and Daniel has written a novel, and the main character of which is based on Alice. Enter Anna (Julia Roberts), an American photographer who says that she has an interest for taking pictures of strangers. Daniel introduces Anna and Alice to one another and they share a private conversation when Daniel leaves. \\"I'm not a thief,\\" Anna assures Alice. But Alice knows, just as well as we do, that she is lying.     More time goes by. Daniel has, shall we say, an \\"Internet conversation\\" with Larry (Clive Owen), an opinionated dermatologist. Posing as Anna, Daniel sets up a date between Larry and Anna. Coincidently, Anna is at Daniel's proposed meeting place at the appointed time, and after moving past an embarassingly awkward meeting, Larry and Anna manage to develop a romantic connection. This is a trick that Daniel will soon regret, because Larry is a man who is so confident with his emotions that he feels inclined to judge the inequities of others.    The two couples are cross-introduced. The events that follow and how they effect each individual should only be hinted at, not thoroughly discussed. But watching the film is to be burdened with a few underlying questions. Do these characters actually love their partners, or are they using one another to satisfy their carnal lusts? And the biggest question, of course, is why? Why do they do the things that they do to each other?     But see, I like movies that make me think like this. I like to absorb a movie and draw ideas out its context. \\"Closer\\" is bold work. Hinging solely on the issue on relationship infidelity, it artistically examines the presence--or absence--of love and honesty in relationships. The film runs so deep that the love rectangle becomes trivial; the film is really about who these people are and what they are capable of.     The film, set over a four year period, is a sequence of the characters meeting each other in pairs and weaving their ways in and out of each other's emotions (the exchange between Larry and Anna at their house wins my award for the most painful scene of the year). All of them are perfectly written and emotionally sincere, but my absolute favorite is the scene between Larry and Daniel towards the end of the film. The two men are polar emotional opposites: Larry is an aggressive, firey-tempered hothead and Daniel is passive and meek. This exchange is like a Tyco truck going up against a tank; there is no way that Daniel can arise victorious. But notice how quickly the two men seem to calm down. After witnessing everything that has come before, and the one scene that comes after, we realize that each man is perfectly capable of sustaining the other's personality.    Roberts, Law, Portman, and Owen deliver spellbinding performances, and detailing their actions will spoil the whole movie. Let's just say that the ones who appear to be the sheep turn out to be the wolves. The film is ironic in the sense that its problem forces the characters to simultaneously bring about their worst qualities and their best. They are equipped with hidden motives, dirty secrets, and lies, and they all seem to take pleasure in what they do to one another. Its as if they are four different superpower nations aiming nuclear weapons at each other, waiting for a missile to fire so they can set off a domino effect.     What the movie fails to do--and I say this in admiration--is force us to pick sides. Yes we are involved with the characters, but the film does not supply us with a particular one to cheer for. We love all four of them but we don't love all four of them. They are evil people, but since we recognize them as humans, we relate to them. This is a paradox that deprives the movie of typical methods and empowers it with intellect. It even causes the movie to walk a thin line between romance and psychological drama.    The destinies of the four people I will not reveal, but \\"Closer\\" has a solution that is uplifting, heartbreaking, and bittersweet in three different areas of thought. In the end, we also wonder if the characters make the right decisions. This is a movie that demands much out of the audience, and it even requires us to analyze ourselves as people.     After seeing the movie, I paced around the outside of the theater for about fifteen minutes, reflecting on what I had just witnessed. \\"Closer\\" is a thinker's movie. It implanted an impact on me that I will not soon forget. The movie doesn't just stop when the story ends; it continues to resonate long after the end credits role, and, in reference to the title, it pulls the audience closer.     NOTE: I also took a few moments to study the film's poster in the theater lobby, and I noticed something about the faces of the characters. If you do what I did and concentrate hard on the positioning of their expressions and how they are presented, you will be able to tell who I think the real \\"villain\\" is. But then again, I might be thinking too hard. - Isaac    Rated R; 102 minutes; Directed by Mike Nichols
B000AWYOGE|3.0|How far would you go to protect your child? We often hear parents say that they'd die for them, but dying is only going so far. What would you be willing to endure in the afterlife for your child ...and perhaps someone else's kid?<br /><br />In DARK WATER, directed by Walter Salles and starring Jennifer Connelly, we get to see exactly how far a damaged mother will go for her child.<br /><br />Dahlia (Connelly) is going through a bitter divorce and custody battle. For her job's sake, Dahlia is forced to move outside the hub of New York City and into a dark, dank apartment complex on Roosevelt Island. With her comes her daughter, Ceci, a ten-year-old with a perceptive extrasensory ability. Or does she have that ability? As soon as they enter the apartment complex, Ceci begins to feel poorly and asks to leave, but her mother insists that they check out the apartment. They soon move in and stranger things begin happening: dark water drips from the ceiling, Dahlia sees her mother (who'd abandoned her) in strange dreams, Ceci talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, and the elevator button for their floor (#9) is burned or damaged.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, we learn that the neighbors directly above Dahlia and Ceci's apartment were Russian immigrants who had a child, but neither the child nor the parents have been seen in some time. Did something foul happen to them? Further research by Dahlia's divorce attorney (played by Tim Roth ) shows that the adults from the upstairs apartment are separated and living apart ...but neither of them have their daughter, who's name happens to be Natasha. Where is she? Is she the same Natasha that Ceci talks to in her imagination? Are Ceci and Natasha somehow connected with the dark water dripping from their ceiling?<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The tone and dark, wet scenes set the tone for DARK WATER in a very revealing fashion. Water plays a vital part of how the viewer perceives much of what is shown on-screen, giving the entire production a rather somber (if downright depressing) feel. This is prime strength of the movie, getting us into how Jennifer Connelly's character feels and why she reacts the way she does (especially after seeing her as a young girl in the opening scenes, waiting for her negligent mother to come and get her from school ...and again, it's raining).<br /><br />Much has been said about this film regarding how much was intended to be psychological versus supernatural. But for me, it was all supernatural. The only part the psychology of Connelly's character played in the film was, again, helping set the tone and as a method for one ghostly apparition to feed off of. If Ceci (the daughter) can see the ghost, then it's not a psychological breakdown on her mother's part.<br /><br />Comparisons between THE RING and THE GRUDGE are pretty obvious, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. But it did make me wonder about how many other thriller films out there are using the same format now.

B000BP86OG|1.0|<br />Allright! This album has divided people in two groups. Some critics hates this really and think the whole band is joke. Other critics and listeners praise the Darkness like a new saviour of rock n' roll. One magazine chose this the best album  of 2005. Unbelieveable and very true! <br /> <br />Ok. In my opinion, they made a good music video for One Way Ticket which is rather good song. Unfortunately, after that song there comes 5 really boring, headless and cliche rock songs <br />Bald is the best and moving song in this album. The rockers really are afraid of 100 times more to come bald than hell or monsters.  Girlfriend, English Country Garden and Blind Man are terrific songs and real pleasure for you who can't hear anything.  <br /> <br />This record will sell millions because there are enough people who still believe the return of the real classic rock...  <br />Finally, there is no return from Hell if you once go there. <br />    <br /> <br /> <br />

0671027344|5.0|I first read this book because my friend recommended it to me. The author mentions the city of Pittsburgh and seeing as I live nearby it was awesome to read about a place that I could picture in my head as I read. The boy in this book goes through so much and I have no idea how he handled it all. At times he was so relaxed that it was frustrating, but it just added to the power. As I read the line that he says when they are driving through the tunnel, \\"And in the moment I swear we were infinite...\\" it really struck me as a wonderful quote. Who in their life has not felt that way. Felt like the moment that they were in would never ever end and they never wanted it to. The main character feels that way a lot and he gives so much detail that I can only wish that I was the person recieving his letters. This books sucks you in and I wish it never ended.
B000BVD460|5.0|Thank you, Eminem, for seven years of hits and artistic brilliance.  You are adored and loved.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is a film that finally does Batman justice. The film somewhat follows the storyline in Frank Miller's Batman: Year One and tells the story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. If you are worried that this film is another Batman & Robin or Batman Forever don't, it's fantastic. Christian Bale makes an excellent Batman and the rest of the cast is great.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Wonderful movie. It reminded me of a Romeo and Juliet story. I'll be buying it the day it comes to DVD. Excellent.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Too often, the problem with many greatest hits albums is that they leave off crucial tracks, thus forcing people to buy the original albums that they may not want.  Most people buying a greatest hits compilation just want the essentials, and in that case, this CD succeeds stupendously.  Each of their four albums is given generous representation, and the CD is well over 70 minutes of excellence.  Though Sade has been unfortunately lumped in with the reprehensible \\"smooth jazz\\" crowd, their music is so much more.  Take \\"Is It A Crime\\" for instance.  The song was recorded live in one take, and is purely organic and totally haunting.  Who can't relate to the emotions expressed in this song when one has gone through a breakup?  Though many of these songs are now 20 years old, they have lost none of their appeal, sound amazing, and show why Sade still has a career ahead of them.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|sometimes music can be a life altering experience.  when this album came out, i was a freshman in high school in a small midwestern town.  i stumbled across it, probably from a review in rolling stone or cream, and listened to it through headphones in my bedroom for hours on end.  as i grew up, the age of the cd came along and this album sat in the 2 crates of albums i refuse to let go of. <br /> <br />my 9 yr. old son got one of those mp3 player things for christmas and we have spent the last few nights downloading the songs he likes onto it.  well, once again i stumbled across scary monsters out there in internet land and downloaded it onto my computer. <br /> <br />i am now sitting here again with headphones on singing all these songs and dancing like a wildman.  the lyrics of 25 years ago just flow out of me like breathing even though i have not heard them forever.  the music is just as fresh now as it was then. <br /> <br />people more knowledgable than i can review the merits of each particular song in objective and analytical ways, but i cannot.  they can compare this album to other bowie albums, but i cannot.  i cannot because this album is impressed upon my musical soul.  it opened my ears to all kinds of music i never knew existed.  i could have been a top 40 listener for the rest of my life, but i did not and it was because of the power of this masterpiece.
1559944323|5.0|I read the book \\"your erroneous zones\\" over 20 years ago.  It saved my life.  After several losses in my life, I felt lost and alone.  A friend recommended Dr. Dyer's book.  I read the book numerous times before what Dr. Dyer explained registered in my brain.  It was quite the journey.  Recently I decided to purchase the book in cassette format so I could listen to it again.  I was amazed at how wonderful it felt to hear the words in the book come to life.  For me it was as if Dr. Dyer was speaking to me directly.  Pretty neat.  Honestly, this cassette was a wise investment for me; and I am sure it will be for you too. <br /> <br />Get the tape and the book if you are looking for answers to why you keep going in circles.
B00005JLKB|5.0|well im just kiddin there is no but.... i have still never seen anything about smallville that isnt great. the cast- OMG!!! never have i seen so much talent and perfect chemistry on the small screen or even on the big screen!  the story- is great, like the little subplots never interfere with the general story, i mean they can affect the main storyline but they never like take over.  the directing- well ive never had a problem withany of the directors before and my favorite i would have to say is James Marshall!  the cinemetography- well if youve seen smallville youll know how great this show is and how great it looks all the time! <br /> <br />well there you haveit lol there isnothing wrong with smallville, it is a perfect tv show and its killing me that i only just started watching it during its 4th season but im buyin all the old seasons already.  but the saddest thing is that the show is coming to an end with the 5th season. Well, God Bless everyone who was involved in the show and i hope they can create more stuff just like it.   <br /> <br />PS- that idea that they do a show of a young bruce wayne would be so awesome!  it would ALMOST fill in the whole in my heart that will go empty when Smallville ends...
B00006GA4C|5.0|Never a fan of 80s Heavy Metal, new music, or really anything that is just plain loud in the arena of rock, I was quite surprised when I first discovered Grand Funk Railroad on a local classic rock station, since they were basically a compilation (albiet an extremely talented one) of all those things I just mentioned.  Of course I first heard We're an American Band, then the Locomotion, Some Kind of Wonderful, and finally heard I'm Your Captain, and realized with that ten minute opus, I just had to find more stuff by this group. <br /> <br />After discovering MurrayTheCat's Top 400 Rock \\"So you'd like to...\\" guides, I chose get myself their quasi-self-titled second album, and could not have been in for more of a surprise.   <br /> <br />While the lyrics of songs like I'm Your Captain may be missing, and the high quality production of later albums is also gone from the fold, this power trio, with emphasis on power, is remarkably different from their radio-friendly tunes.  This just happens to be a good thing. <br /> <br />From the first drum whacks of Got This Thing on the Move, to the cacophonous finale of Inside Looking Out, this is the most delicious hard rock album I have had the joy of listening to outside of Captain Beyond's first album.   <br /> <br />You get the pounding of Got This, to the fun, rollicking High Falootin' Woman (with a tasty keyboard part that sounds like a harpsicord towards the middle), to the mind-boggling guitar \\"thing\\" at the end of In Need, to the most passionate vocals from Mark in Inside Looking Out, this album will tickle your fancy from start to finish.   <br /> <br />I don't think most people associate this type of music with much talent, just look at 80s heavy metal for proof; but these guys are anything but untalented.  The fact that these three guys can put out so much energy into their music and still be able to hold themselves together better than groups like the Faces, and sound just as great live, is quite an amazing feat.  Mel's bass parts are always intense, but never so in your face that you forget the rest of the band.  Don's drumming is also brash, reckless, and played with abandon, but never draws attention to himself, or causes the band to fall apart, in fact, he does an amazing job holding everything together.  And Mark's guitar playing is totally unique to him.  I've never heard anything like it before or since.  He knows when to back off and let the others share the spotlight, how to play intelligent licks and riffs, but still can blow your pants off with an amazing solo, whether on guitar or harmonica (if that's him on the harp, I don't really know.) <br /> <br />PS: If that really is a harpsicord on High Falootin' Woman, then slap me silly, because to not only hear it on a rock album, but this particular album, and not sound out of place, is just amazing. <br /> <br />Also, if you are looking for more similar to this, and new to the group, check out their more 60s sounding On Time, and the more finely tuned E Pluribus Funk, you will not regret it.  Turn those amps to eleven.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have read the book before I saw the movie.  The adaptation in my opinion is absolutely brilliant.  The movie is rather short, I dont know how they did it - fit everything in and have not given up anything improtant.  I thought the script was a real work of art and talant - so few words (sometimes not even words, but only looks) and so much meaning is relayed.   <br /> <br />Actors (particulary Ann and Captain Wentworth) are magnificent - they capture their characters so true to the novel - the filmmakers were really lucky to find such fantastic cast.  Why hasnt Amanda Root been seen in any other movies is beyond my imagination, she was amazingly genuine. (seriously, I cant fathom why she was not appreciated by many reviewers here, her acting was so authentic) <br /> <br />I reread the novel recently and rewatched the movie.  I am just amazed at the talant of whoever wrote the script - it's a jem!
B000BOH8XW|2.0|Shakira is an amazing pop artist.  No one can deny that. Her two big Spanish albums Pies Descalzos and especially her masterpiece Donde Estan Los Ladrones? heightened the success of Spanish language albums internationally.  Equally, her charisma is unparalleled.  Every album she puts out is a hit and there is a certain magnetism in her persona, whereas for other singers making career choices like hers (for example the big sexy bombshell Americanized blonde makeover) would garner them a lot of negative criticism and the public wouldn't buy it.  But not Shakira.  This sexy lady moves the units.   <br /> <br />I wasn't a big fan of her big crossover, Laundry Service, yet its catchy singles took off and that album sold over ten million copies.  2005 was a big year for her with two releases.  I liked the first volume of her Oral Fixation records in Spanish.  There was a new element of refined songwriting involved that sounded mature while adhering to her commercial intents.  I wanted to like this second volume but as I suspected the words were problematic. If I didn't have a lyric sheet, they would be virtually unintelligible.  Also these lyrics are very clumsy.  A lot of the songs are based on what you would call \\"serious matters,\\" like her dialogue with God in the opening song \\"How Do You Do\\" and the likewise social commentary/protest of the closer \\"Timor,\\" but she's weighed down by awkward phrasing that is worsened by her need to rhyme.  The fact that she pretty much learned English during the last several years and that she's attempting to write lyrically conscious music is admirable, but she doesn't really succeed at all.  She should stick with writing in Spanish.  She has a knack for it.  She's a Latin rock poetess.   <br /> <br />Sonically, vol. 2 is good, but not as good as the tunes on volume 1.  There is not a big smash like \\"La Tortura\\" to be had here.  There's nothing on the record that would liken a hit of that magnitude (and the lead single \\"Don't Bother\\"is pretty non-sensational in comparison), which is ironic considering the loud production of this record.  There are a lot of elements that make for an enormous pop record (big name producers, eclectic arrangements) but hearing her sing these words are distracting.  Also, having Santana on the record is a bad idea.  Maybe six years ago when he was more of a commodity but the guy is washed out.  I wish she would get off the big commercial mode and go back to the more singer-songwriter style that she had in the 90s.
B000BWI9U0|4.0|I agree with some other reviews in a sense that the strokes sound has matured for this album. BUT in my opinion that strips them of some of their sound-defining edginess. It's worth a listen, but I'm going to probably be listening their 2 previous albums more.  <br /> <br />Tracks previously released from The Strokes on other albums have all varied very drastically, some with an almost whimsical feel and others that sound like the CD player is stuck on fast forward. If you're looking for more of the latter, this album may disappoint. With a few exception like Juicebox, which you've probably heard by now already.  The former is also not quite represented(with the exception of You Only Live Once, my favorite song on the CD). The Strokes seem to have found a happy medium, which is great except over half the tracks sound like that. There is actually a surplus of songs that in my opinion are way too calm for The Strokes. They are however, almost beautiful, but there are too many of them. <br /> <br />The guitar and bass are especially fantastic, though. Fraiture, Hammond, and Valensi have definately drawn some of the attention usually directed toward Casablancas's vocals to their creative riffs and thumping bass lines. I'd turn up the bass all the way to listen to this album.  <br /> <br />I do recommend this album for a strokes fan, BUT I definately would not recommend it if you haven't heard Room on Fire and Is This It?
B000BYRCH4|3.0|On my top 10 movies of 2005, I ranked this #4.<br /><br />It wasn't a brilliant beyond brilliant Oscar worthy movie, but I thought it had a good decent story line and beautiful cinematography, especially the water scenes.<br /><br />It kind of lost me towards the end, but I stuck it out and in the end, I did like it.  I ended up watching it 4 more times before I had to return it (I had it rented for a week).  Paul Walker and Jessica Alba are not the greatest actors in the world, but for the plot, story line and what they had to work with, I thought they did well.  Plus, I'll be honest, Paul Walker, half naked in water; who wouldn't want to watch that?!?!<br /><br />I would compare this movie to Blue Crush.  It's just a fun summer-y flick with good-looking people, average story line and beautiful tropical backdrops.<br /><br />Although I gave it a 3, if you are a fan of Paul Walker or Jessica Alba or Josh Brolin, but are hesitant to watch it..rent it!  It'll be worth it, especially if you are in a cold climate this winter.  The warm tropical atmosphere/theme jumps out at you and you can't help but smile.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since hearing about its nasty little premise.  The idea of paying money to torture and kill with impunity is creepy beyond all human comprehension.  Sadly the film doesn't deliver enough shocks or squirms to pay off my high expectations.  Like Saw, Hostel tries to ride far too long on the messed up factor and lacks the cohesion required to, well, keep it together.<br /><br />Whether this is a reflection on society at large or my own jaded mentality toward onscreen horror, Hostel fails to provide that much needed jolt to the genre.  By all accounts this movie should have been great.  It's about one hundred fifty times better than Cabin Fever, which so many people seemed to love, so there's a plus.  Eli Roth seems to be getting the hang of the directing thing.  However, there are too many scenes where torture is happening and the imagery is left to the imagination.  This is a movie, we're supposed to see what's happening.<br /><br />So what exactly is my gripe here?  Hostel just isn't vicious enough.  That's right, for some reason Roth and Co. seemed to have held back on what was promised to the audience.  Not once do you forget that the people on the screen are just acting, which is necessary for the suspension of disbelief.  Finally, the truly disappointing bit, the gore is presented more as background than as the proper effusion of bodily fluids. Not that there isn't gore to be found, it's just not anything to tell the kids about.<br /><br />I imagine there will be an unrated director's cut with some tag line like \\"Too Gruesome for Theaters\\" or \\"Here's the Real Movie Folks\\" and if that happens I'll give Hostel another whirl.  Honestly, if Quentin Tarantino sees promise in the work of Eli Roth that's reason enough for me to follow the guy's career.  If there's a geometric progression to his growth as a director the man could bring the Horror genre something great. In the future.  Not entitled Hostel.<br /><br />Still, this is a solid attempt at brutal Horror, and for that it deserves one handed applause.  Recent amputees don't have the state of mind or the hardware for full fledged applause. Blame the blood loss./> <br />Still, this is a solid attempt at brutal Horror, and for that it deserves one handed applause.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|While I have nothing but respect for their previous work, I am a fan that likes to see KoRn continue to push the creative envelope. In addition, I was nervous about how the departure of founding guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, would effect the resulting album. Thankfully, all my fears were immediately laid to rest with SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. While their last album was a delicious look back at KoRn's earlier songwriting days(embodied in new songs), as well as a very appropriate release prior to their Greatest Hits collection, I felt that the new album would need to mark a step into the future of this legendary group...and indeed it does. From the opening track, the industrial-tinged single \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" to the soul-bearing finale of \\"Tearjerker,\\" the listener may be pleasantly surprised to see how KoRn has filled the void of losing a major part of their sonic force. Remaining guitarist James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer steps up to the challenge of KoRn being a single guitarist band for the first time in their history, and does a impressive job of maintaining the heavy feel of KoRn's overall sound. Indeed, it is evident that overdubbs were utilized in the studio to maintain KoRn's classic double seven-string effects, but perhaps more interestingly present are the programming effects, industrial drums and other aural decorations that paint the dark and twisted background to this recording. While the overall theme of the album is very progressive, with vocalist Jon Davis spending almost no time lyrically on the subject of child abuse, and an equally absent presence of bassist Fieldy's trademark \\"clicking\\" slap, the album does showcase a few of their old arsenal. The most notible of these, of course, would be Davis' use of the bagpipes, as well as Munky's guitar effects, which sound as if he caked mud over his strings before plugging in to create his splendidly dirty sound. Overall, this is perhaps KoRn's most daring and experimental album to date, and it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time in the bands history. It is a definitive step forward for the band that also doesn't alienate their previous work.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|I adore this CD. It is just perfect. It makes me feel like I'm in the middle ages or some far away time. Every song is well-written and well-executed. It's haunting, inspiring, and filled with celtic and moroccan rhythm.  <br /> <br />My favorites are the Mummer's Dance and The Highwayman (which is actually the famous poem). Every time I listen to these songs, I can see a whole scene in my head. For example, when I hear the song Skellig I can see the monks bending over manuscripts lit by dusk and candlelight. <br /> <br />This is a great CD if you like Loreena McKinnett or if you love music inspired by history and Celtic sounds. As a writer, this CD is fun to listen to because it creates whole worlds in my head.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br />At first I was a little skeptical about the quality of the author's writing switching the narrative among characters however that skepticism quickly dissolved as I become totally engrossed in these characters and the manner in which they related to each other. <br />A truly amazing book which was able to derive so many emotions out of me .I distinctively remember crying on 3 occasions throughout reading the novel (one time in public).I think this novel will turn out just wonderfully on screen. <br />So impressed with Jodi Picoult's work I had to get another. <br />
0064409422|5.0|I stumbled across this \\"full-color collector's edition\\" and am so glad I did!  The books are so much nicer than your average paperback, with thick, white pages and full-color illustrations.  I am very hard on books, love them right to death, so much so that my book-loving 18 year old daughter winces when I ask to borrow one of hers.  This book held up to my not so tender loving care.  It's a pleasure to read such a quality book, without having to invest in the hardcover editions. Besides, when I read a hardcover, the cover sometimes starts to come off...  I highly recommend this edition of the Chronicles of Narnia series!
055380457X|1.0|In the pre-Viagra age of the porn industry there was a job on movie sets called \\"Fluffer\\".  This woman, or specifically her mouth, would be on call if the male talent needed a little encouragement during the shoot to provide that \\"feel-good\\" service to enable him to get back to business.  <br /> <br />This book is like a giant Google-fluffer. <br /> <br />Everything that Google does is wonderful, cutting edge, prescient, meteoric, innovative, defiant, fun, etc.   <br /> <br />While there is no doubt that Google's rise is a good story, this book merely hits the highlights which anybody following Google over the years is already familiar with.  There is lip service (pun intended) paid to some of the controversy Google is in, Privacy, Copyright, Patent infringement issues, etc., but it's all done in the light of how \\"right\\" the Google point of view is, and how backwards their antagonists are. <br /> <br />So, one comes away from the book wishing that it provided a more even-handed approach, cast just a little of a critical eye, etc. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Google fan, user, etc. so I'm not knocking Google on principle, just this book. <br /> <br />I suppose it's fine if you want a cursory, frothy overview of the company history, but one wishes that the froth weren't so creamy. <br /> <br />-Steve
0441012906|4.0|Having read and loved Reynolds' previous novels I was pleased to find something different. While mixing genres such as SF, detective noir, and alternative history may seem like a tall order, Reynolds crafts a belivable scenario and delivered for a me a book I could not put down.  <br />Reynolds can write; the characters are flawed and interesting, his concepts bold, and humour sparks through at odd moments. This is not SF action of the space opera kind. Instead a thoughtful and elaborate plot without the usual denouement of a happy end.  <br />Most people I know who read SF are men, but this was one SF novel my wife loved.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|This movie was bad. There are few movies that I would actually walk out on. I would have on this but others were there and I had to stay. And it was painful. I loved the original with Gene Wilder which was a story about a boy and his dream. This version was really all about how wierd Willy Wonka is. His character is very cold, right up to the end and quite frankly, it is depressing. There is no character development for Charlie Bucket at all, in my opinion one of the best characters of the original.  <br /> <br />Some of the best parts of the original were the oompa loompa scenes. This one uses all the same person (as an oompa loompa) CG'd into many roles and does not look like one would imagine an oompa loompa would look like. <br /> <br />I also really like Johny Depp as an actor and will watch anything that he is in (he was awesome in Pirates). This was not a good role for him though and I think he was mis-cast.  <br /> <br />That's 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, save your time, skip this one!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Beautifully written characters and a very fresh and creative setting.  I just squirmed a bit when my young sons asked me several times what a whore is (which the beautiful actress is oft referred to as by the otherwise very likable Captain), necessitating me to screen the episodes for content before I let them watch them.  We don't watch TV much and I was really surprised this was allowed on prime time TV.  But for this one fault, I would bet that this series would have lived on as a solidly written show for the whole family!   <br /> <br />Sorry but that needed to be said.  I think they figured this out because the wildly popular movie Serenity still featured the \\"companion\\" character but GREATLY diminished the presence of her profession.   <br /> <br />Having that out of the way, I will say that as an adult viewer I love this series and am bummed that this show got cancelled.  There is a real chemistry between the characters and the writing is solid.  The acting, noticably good!  I sincerely hope that SciFi or some other network picks this up and continues the series.  The writing, character interaction and development is the best I've seen on TV since NYPD Blue.   <br /> <br />I recommend you buy it and enjoy it.  Just be careful about letting the kiddies see unscreened episodes!  And FYI: Out of all episodes, only 3 or 4 are not for the kids.  Others may judge differently.
0449002632|5.0|This is a great novel. I orginally read it on a plane trip coming back from Britian, but have reread parts of it again. The way this novel is set up is ingenious, the character's lineage and the way that the plots weave together is great. This book really gives one a sense of London's history with in a work of fiction, it's funner then reading a stodgy non-fiction history book. This is a big thick read, great for a plane ride, but breaks up into individual stories, so that you don't have to read it all at one time to enjoy it. I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially if you will be traveling to London, or have traveled there in the past.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand returns with their second breakthrough album, showing just how good they really can make themselves sound musically.    THE FALLEN--The best choice of a song to start the album off with, unless you like to save the best for last. Hands down, the absoloute best song of the entire year. Nothing yet has come close. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.    DO YOU WANT TO--Another very good song, though this song features more pop music than THE FALLEN. But a great song nevertheless, and fun to sing along to as well. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.    THIS BOY--Okay, nowhere near as good as any of the others. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's just that the other two were so good that this one is rather dwarfed in comparison. Featuring by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy and Paul Thomson.     WALK AWAY--One of the gentlest songs by the band that doesn't feature piano yet. It has the sound of the type of song that could be played at the end scene of PULP FICTION, right before the closing credits. Nice acoustic sound. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    EVIL AND A HEATHEN--Somewhere along the ranking of THIS BOY. Has a nice dance rythem with the guitar sound, but the singing could be more interesting. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    YOU'RE THE REASON I'M LEAVING--Pretty good song. Enjoyable to listen to, but annoying to get stuck in your head for too long. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.    ELEANOR PUT YOUR BOOTS ON--The first piano song. More of a ballad than anything, written about Alex's girlfriend. I'm rather uninterested by it. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos.    WELL THAT WAS EASY--Starts out as a fast paced rock song and gradually slows down. Rather good song, good to listen to once in a while. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    WHAT YOU MEANT--This song has the most awesome rock guitar introduction in the whole album. However, it turns rather acoustic after that, and loses it's interesting touch. But as soon as the rock interlude comes back, it picks up all over again. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.    I'M YOUR VILLAIN--I haven't listened to this song very much, but from what I remember, it's a fairly good song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    YOU COULD HAVE IT SO MUCH BETTER--The second-to-best song on the album. Has an awesome guitar solo and a great tune. A fabulous song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    FADE TOGETHER--Another piano song; too soft for my taste. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos.    OUTSIDERS--A more electric-sounding cousin of WALK AWAY. A fairly good song too. Closes off the album pretty well. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thomson
B000001Y79|5.0|I knew it wouldn't be right for me to just own Gwen Stefani's debut solo album, I had to get my paws on a No Doubt album, I finally after much deliberation with myself decided on Tragic Kingdom. If you think Gwen is just a Madonna wannabe, forget it, she was one of the original modern day rock queens. She along with the rest of No Doubt led the 90's movement of Ska-rock. Her voice is perfectly suited to the genre, she has the range and the expressiveness.<br /><br />I found upon first listening to this album everything seemes clangy and a bit 'hyper'. After listening to this album more I found that it was clangy, but that's just their style. It showed some real potential and the songs started to reveal themselves as gems.<br /><br />Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of 1995, though it couldn't come close to the success of Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette. Still it provided bored Orange County teenagers with role models and something to listen to.<br /><br />I love No Doubt's style, they were doing something no other 'mainstream' band were doing and having huge success with it. Their mixture of Ska-rock-pop and tiny elements of ragga propelled them into the musical spotlight. This album is like a soundtrack to California at the time, this is what California sounded like in 1995.<br /><br />No Doubt are Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and then Eric Stefani was part of the mix), they sound like the best band in the world on this album. With Gwen's unique, angelic voice, Tony's pulsating bass strums, Tom's catchy guitar riffs, and Adrian's super syncopated percussion (also those fab keyboards from Eric) made No Doubt top of the music industry.<br /><br />Tragic Kingdom contains some great songs most famous of those is undoubtedly Don't Speak. Other highlights of this album include: Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr. and Just A Girl.<br /><br />This album is the perfect length, not too long yet not that short. Also I like the fact there are only 2 quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden' affair.<br /><br />Overall, Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and they bring back memories, that is an integral part of what music is about. Whether it be the fact that this album shows you that Gwen isn't just a plastic pop doll but a geniune rock chick or you get to listen to Don't Speak all over again you must own this album.t there are only 2 quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden' affair. <br /> <br />Overall, Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and they bring back memories, that is an integral part of what music is about.

068484267X|5.0|From the beginning when McCourt mentions that there is nothing worst than the Irish childhood, you can't help but to be hooked by such bluntness. As the story continues you see the tragedy, horror and misery that no child should ever have to live in.  <br /> <br />Born in America to Irish immigrant parents, little Frankie lived in Brooklyn with his three brothers, baby sister, emotionally detached mother and the stereotypically drunk and chronically unemployed father. When tragedy strikes, the McCourts move back to Ireland (as Frank put it, the only Irish family going away from the statue of liberty) to restore their luck. Unfortunately the family encounter an even worst predicament than in America. Forced to be on welfare because the father cannot keep a job due to his drinking problem, the family suffers from constant deaths, starvations and illnesses. <br /> <br />The catholic church plays a large overbearing role in Frank McCourt's life. Taught by abusive priest, the poor kids are brought up on contradictory messages that it is okay to be poor, yet shunned by the priest for being poor. The priest beat their students and tell them about sins, but I feel the worst sin of all is keeping the Irish community poor by blaming all their problems on the English persicution centuries before. <br /> <br />By the end of this book you'd have read so much misery in Frank McCourt's life that you'd wonder why he just didn't commit suicide and end his suffering. A movie adaptation has been made of this book that is okay but it's best to read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" for the full sad story.
0375714669|5.0|Bravo.  A wonderful seamless melding of history, memoir, fiction, and visual art.  I was skeptical about the ability of the graphic novel to communicate, but what better way than a visual illustration to show how uncomfortable and dehumanizing is the hooded scarf.  The main character (fictionalized author/first person) is lovable: full of faults, sometimes wavering in whether she should conform with the others (the easier path), but ultimately true to herself, as her wise grandmother advises her to be.  What a wonderful family she has, her parents really let her be herself, regardless of the impossible oppressive social environment that is the Iran of the 1970s and 1980s.  This story is a testament to how a family cannot just bow to the status quo, but has the power to influence their only child, a daughter, to stand up to political oppression, even if it means self-exile.  Again, not only is this a wonderful story of a family, but on a parallel level, is an excellent history of Iran the nation, the conflicts in the Middle East, and the ambivalent aftermath of colonialism and centuries of war and conquest.  I am looking forward to the translation of Persepolis 3 (my French will never improve fast enough to read it in the original).
B00005BL2A|3.0|You can read all sorts of other reviews here about the wild times DM had been through the last several years and how this album supposedly reflects back on that.  Suffice it to say that during this period, the flame was gone.  Despite its name, this album will not likely excite anybody.  Isn't it a bit strange for an album called \\"Exciter\\" to have a song called \\"Comatose\\" on it? <br /> <br />Regardless of the bad reviews and even my own feelings toward this album for so long, it's really not *bad*.  If you're not a DM fan, I'd steer way clear of this as a representative piece of Depeche Mode work.  You could pick just about any other album from their catalog and get a much better picture of what these guys are capable of.  If you're a fan, there's no reason not to own this, though.  It's certainly not their best work.  In fact, it may be their least inspired work in their entire 25 year career.  However, it's still Depeche Mode and they had much farther to go before declining to the point where I wouldn't listen.
0399230033|5.0|Author is a genius who understands the toddler mind extremely well.  Great ending.  Our toddler wants to read this book five times a day, but I don't hate the book yet.  There is a great difference between a perfect book and a good book: this is a perfect book.
B00005ABIP|5.0|Don't bother with the comings and goings of various band members over the years.  Cake has only gotten better with age, and where they started wasn't bad to begin with.  Their first album (Motorcade of Generosity) was good.  Fashion Nugget was very good.  Prolonging the Magic is also very good, possibly even better.  Don't listen to those who claim the magic faded after Fashion Nugget. <br /> <br />These guys are masters at blending various musical stylings into a style that is nearly impossible to pin down.  There's just not anybody out there doing anything like what Cake does.  It's been said that the genius of Eric Clapton doesn't lie in the notes that he plays, but in the notes he doesn't play.  This is entirely true of Cake as well.  You won't find complicated arrangements or sophisticated lyrics.  This is music from the soul played with feeling.  They're not out to impress you with how many incredible riffs they can pull off or amazing drum solos. <br /> <br />You may have heard singles from them over the years such as The Distance, Never There (from this album), and Short Skirt Long Jacket.  I did.  I never thought much of them until Short Skirt.  By that time I realized that Cake was something different.  I figured it was time to really check them out.  I've since bought every CD.  They're all incredible. <br /> <br />If you're just getting into Cake, this album makes a fantastic introduction, as would Comfort Eagle.  The others are good to great in their own right, but Prolonging and Comfort Eagle represent a peak of Cake creativity where every song resonates with the essence of this band.  If you like one or both of these releases, you will no doubt want to indulge in the others. <br /> <br />P.S. If these guys ever come to your town to play, GO.  There's nothing like a Cake show.

B0007TKNL0|1.0|After what Moulin Rouge and Chicago showed a movie musical could be, this should have been the next big thing. And it starts off promising with a sepia fade in to the auction of the items left over in the theater and the two quiet older bidders silently raising their paddles as the item lots come up. But, oh, it gets really bad quick. Minnie Driver has been great in every other thing she has done, but her intentionally annoying character here is just, well, too annoying. And that leads me into the problem that dogs the movie to the end. The actors on stage are so clearly not singing, that it's impossible to connect the emotion of the song to the person.  For as much care as the director put into the set of this movie, the fact that the syncing is so awful is inexplicable.  Then there are the other three actors, all of whom are just too wimpy and uninspired to raise the temperature of this romantic tragedy above tepid.  Its like this, if you read harlequin romances because of the covers, maybe you will like watching these comely chiseled statues. Otherwise, you're either going to laugh your way through this film, or turn it off.

B000AA305M|4.0|I'm a big David Gray fan, and this CD is quickly becoming one of my favorites. That said, however, I have never had such skipping problems with a new CD as I have with this one! It began skipping the very first time I played it, and after only 5 or 6 times playing it, I cannot tell you how many times I have winced at hearing yet another bad skip.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is because of having a DVD recorded on the opposite side or some other reason, but something's wrong. I'm seriously considering copying the CD, putting away the original, and just listening to the copy (provided the original is not too scratched already to produce a good copy!)

The Buena Vista Social Club is an aural garden of the senses not to be missed.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Movie audiences have always loved movies about movies.  And even more so, movies about very popular movies.  Capote is a movie about the writing of a book that became a very popular movie.  The critics certainly loved Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the tortured novelist and the movie Capote; it's just a question of time before we know how popular this film turns out to be.  As far as I am concerned, Capote is the first major DVD release of 2006.<br /><br />In Cold Blood has long been considered one of the most realistic crime dramas ever filmed, and it's considered a high-point of 1960's cinema, mostly for it's documentary style.  In the film Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote mentions that In Cold Blood represented a new type of literary accomplishment, a work based on fact presented in the style of narrative fiction.  Capote himself said that the book was meant to re-define non-fiction, and in fact, it did.  Many writers have since copied the style pioneered by Capote in the book In Cold Blood.<br /><br />The film tells the story of the writing of the book, and how it led to Capote's artistic downfall, despite its overwhelming success.  The film makes it clear that Capote was emotionally involved with one of the killers, but not enough to prevent himself from lying and manipulating the condemned and doomed men to get what he wanted.  The film also clearly details the cold emotionless manner in which Capote is able to divorce himself from his feelings and his conscience in order to develop his book, deceiving the killers into believing that their cooperation would somehow lead to their lives being spared, if not their actual exoneration.  In the process, Capote loses track of his own moral compass, yet was profoundly affected by his intense involvement with the two killers.  In order to gain their trust, Capote had to develop a friendship with the killers, and in fact, his friendship Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) borders on obsession.  We are never quite sure throughout the film exactly what is going on inside Capote's head; at times his interest in the killer's welfare appears quite genuine, at other points it appears that he is using them solely for the sake of getting a good book out of it.  Whatever his precise feelings, he suffered for his involvement - a post script to the film reminds us that In Cold Blood was the last piece of work that Capote ever finished.  Following the books completion, he began a downhill progression into alcohol addiction that he never overcame.  The film does not dwell on Capote's sexuality; although his male partner is included in several scenes, their relationship is never explored or physically represented, and his homosexuality is given a matter-of-fact but unobtrusive handling.<br /><br />Some of the scenes lifted from those in the original film In Cold Blood are done so well that, aside from the fact that the original was filmed in black and white, you can scarcely tell the difference.  The scene towards the end when the killers are finally executed so closely resembles the original film that you almost think it was lifted directly from it.<br /><br />On the whole, the film is dramatically satisfying and extremely entertaining.  Coupled with the extraordinary performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, it emerges as a near perfect motion picture.n obsession.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! At the Disco is a new band full of Las Vegas scene kids clever enough to think of such clever, mature, maybe even funny if you read it without the music, lyrics. Brendon Urie's(Vocals, Guitar, Keyboard, Piano, Accordion, Organ) voice is very extraordinary and just makes this type of music more fun to listen to. Of course with Ryan Ross'(Lyrics, Guitar, Keyboard, Piano, Accordion, Organ) very clever lyrics nothing would be possible. But no one can forget Brent Wilson(Bass) and Spencer Smith(Drums, Percussion). Their music is great to dance to and is good for parties. If you actually got this far through my review and didnt switch to another one, Thanks. Now lets get to the main part.<br /><br />01.Introduction- 10/10: It's an introduction. You cant really demand too much of it. I personally thought it was a good one too.<br /><br />02.The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage- 10/10: Great song. Catchy lyrics. Great beat and rythm. The acoustic guitar and the singer fuse well together in this song. Right away the song demands you to tap your toes and snap your fingers, and this song makes you do just that. You might even break into a dance.<br /><br />03.London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines- 10/10: Another Amazing song. Fast lyrics but not in your face. Greath rythm and beat that makes you want to bob your head and stomp your feet. The lyrics just hang onto you and dont let go, demanding you to sing along. Panic! At the Disco is the only band full of 19-year-olds that can say \\"We're are just a wet dream for the webzine\\" without sounding stupid.<br /><br />04.Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks- 8/10: I'm sorry but this was one of my least favorite song on this cd. I still thought it was really good. I loved the chorus.<br /><br />05.Camisado- 10/10: Really Really great song. This one grabs your attention, turns your rug into a dancefloor, and shoots a gun at your feet forcing you to dance. You just feel like dancing to this song. It really good.<br /><br />06.Time to Dance- 10/10: GREAT dance song too. Good mix of Techno and the regular guitars and drums. Easy lyrics, but very strong ones, that makes you want to scream them out. I even found my self screaming \\"When I say Shotgun you say wedding! Shotgun, Wedding! Shotgun, Weddng!\\". Great explosive ending to this song also.<br /><br />07. Lying is the Most Fun a Girl can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off- 10/10: A tone down of energy from the other songs, this song is a nice blend of maturity, lust, and great lyrics. Makes you want to dance, or even makeout with the person next to you...<br /><br />08.Intermission- 9/10: Gives you a break from all the previous songs. I enjoyed it though, I liked the piano and thought it was a good way to split up the cd. I got scared at the end of the song haha.<br /><br />09.But It's Better if You Do- 11/10: This is one of my Top 3 Favorite songs. Makes you want to dance, sing along, and even write the song all over your wall. Check it out for yourself, this is only my opinion. heh.<br /><br />10.I Write Sins Not Tragedies- 11/10: Lovely song. The beginning politely asks you to pay attention, but in 30 seconds they demand your attention. I fell in love with this song, this one the first song I heard from them.<br /><br />11.I Constantly Thank Esteban- 15/10: My Most Favorite Song ever! I had to learn the lyrics right away. It made my knees move while a was sitting, even standing. I love this song, but its up to YOU so check it out.<br /><br />12. There's a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Havent Thought of it Yet- 15/10: Very Interesting song. Makes you want to listen through the whole song wondering what they will say. This song makes you want to throw on a hot outfit, grab your lover, and dance all around the floor with a rose in your mouth.<br /><br />13. Build God, Then We'll Talk- 20/10: The best song on this cd to me. Catchy lyrics. This song turns you into a bobble head, flicking over and over again, making your head bob side to side. I dont really know how you would dance to this song though. I had fun singing it though.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful for you at all. I've said things over and over again in this review, like that this cd makes you dance, and makes you sing. But it does, great cd to play at parties. It does have 2 bad words so this might be recommended for \\"PG-13\\" kiddies and not the \\"PG\\" kids. This isn't emo. It's, in my opinion, Dance Punk or Dance Rock, because it is. This cd has a classy touch to it, using elegent words, clever ryhmes, things like that. This cd will make you tired and sore, but asks to be played once more.

0446605409|4.0|i like his writing style. he writes as if the character is talking to the reader, and his ability to add humor and sarcasm to the story lightens up a story that would otherwise not be funny (a murder mystery). the chacter, John Corey, is likeable and the story is easy to reader. i very much enjoyed it as a novel and an entertaining read.
B000683VI4|5.0|Oh My Gosh! I really didn't want to see this movie at first. Like seriously I thought it sounded so stupid and I just didn't want to see it (and that's pretty bad because I am a hopeless romantic). But then i go to the video store and there is like literally nothing there that appeals to me there. So i say, \\"sure, i can always try it.\\"  So i take the movie home and i get half way through it, and then i have to leave. So about three days later i pop it back into the DVD player and i start it over again. When i finished that movie the only thoughts going through my head were, \\"I loved that movie, i have to watch it again.\\" I have seen that movie like 6 times since then and i still feel the need to watch it consecutively. It is such a great movie, one that when you're a grandparent you're going to tell your grandkids about how they don't know what they're missing by not seeing this movie.  This is like one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life!    (Please Note this is not the listed C. Hamilton, it is his daughter)
B000AM6MKU|5.0|The Polar Express has long been one of my favorite books.  To me, it cuts right through the discussions of Christmas and Santa and talks about personal belief.  I am a believer in the simple beauty of a child's smile, and therefore I can believe in Santa.  So simple. <br /> <br />The special edition with the globe and train were my son's favorite present this year.  I did not need to tell him that it had been purchaced for the entire family, as he insists that we sit and watch it together.  His smile is wide and genuine, and my heart is filled.
B000000OSE|5.0|Use Your Illusion I is a masterpiece. Includes the #1 singles, Don't Cry and November Rain.  The Garden features Alice Cooper and Guns N' Roses produced a masterpiece in both Use Your Illusion I and II and it's hard to believe that it has been 14 years since Guns N' Roses produced an album.  Use Your Illusion I and II held the #1 and #2 position on Billboard's 200 Albums and remained in the pole position for quite a while. These two records have sold more than five million copies, respectively. You Could Be Mine, Estranged, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Civil War and The Garden were all hits for this band. <br /> <br />Guns N' Roses is one of the best metal bands in history and their singles Don't Cry and November Rain gave them crossover success into the maintstream and at least three top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100. <br /> <br />Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Ozzy Osbourne and Sevendust are the best metal bands around and let's hope we see a new album from G N' R soon. <br />
B0000CABBW|4.0|I was a good movie, it wasn't pg-13 though! scenery was great, beautiful setting.<br /><br />Great actors.
B000AP04FG|5.0|There are many that saw this movie just because of all the rumors that were flying around about Pitt, Jolie, and Aniston. I, myself, I think, could be included in this hop-along-the-bandwagon embarrassment. I didn't really know what I was about to see. I'd just seen a few commercials, and thought, Brad and Angelina... okay... I've got to see this. Watching it, I completely forgot it was two actors... the only names that applied were Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The actual actors are never there with you. When you see the movie, it's got nothing to do with who plays the roles. This movie is spectacular. I was glued to my seat, jaw-dropped and all. My adrenaline was going and it just got me so thrilled and excited. The story's great, the characters are mysteriously enchating, it's smart, adventurous, thrilling, and comical. Your eyes will be attached to the screen-- mine really were. There is some really good acting in here, along with Vince Vaughn, who is incredibly funny, and will, without a doubt, have you laughing. A lot of the conversation is done through meaningful stares and notions that can be seen throughout fight scenes and love scenes. And the music only adds to the absolutely amazing film. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is definitely worth anyone's time. You'll have a blast!
0156027321|5.0|I put off reading this book for nearly two years, despite the fact that my literary sister had gushingly recommended it.  The premise sounded dull, even if the critics' (and my sister's) reviews were glowing.  Luckily, I finally gave it a chance.  Once I finally cracked the cover, I literally could not put this book down.  It's not that it was fast-paced or completely packed with adventure; there was just something gripping and magical about it....and that impression was intensified ten-fold by the last few pages of the book.  I've since heard that this book will \\"make you believe in God.\\"  Even as a sometimes-cynic, I can truly say it made me really examine the subject of spirituality.  This was hands-down my favorite book of 2005.
0553801503|1.0|'A Feast for Crows' has turned out to be a famine for readers who were expecting far more of Martin after his first three books.  This one is so boring that I found myself actually skipping passages just to get through it.  After waiting so long for an ending to this tale, I was very disappointed.  I recommend that everyone skip this one and just hope the next one is better.   <br /> <br />I don't know what happened to Martin, but he has certainly gone downhill.  Or perhaps he collaborated on this book with Robert Jordan, whose books also drag on and on, with no end in sight. <br /> <br />
B00008S2VG|5.0|This was Madonna's worst selling album of her career. BUT, DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU-this album sold millions of copies! For any other artist it would be considered one of their greatest selling albums, but for Madonna it was her worst selling album to date. <br />However, I believe this is one of her greatest albums-I should know, I have every album she's made! <br />This is one of her more personal albums, and I think the more Madonna matures, the more she lets the listener know more about her and her beliefs.  <br />This album-like the previous two-has many Kabbalah references, which I believe is great. Although, most people will probably miss them if they don't have any basic knowledge of Kabbalah. <br />This is not a Kabbalah album though, it is Madonna at her personal best, and she did it great.  <br />A GREAT GREAT ALBUM!!! ONE OF HER BEST EVER!!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|great movie altogether. sometimes i wonder if those who worry so much about the gay content of movies and its effect on children, stop to think about how their hateful, unforgiving attitudes may have a greater impact on them. the movie reflects part of what being gay is about. there is nothing gay (=happy) about being gay. it sucks regardless of how carefree some gay people may want to be perceived as. before you review this or any other film, get a heart. the film may have flaws but at least someone had what it takes to make it, and the acting is excellent. peace.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is one of the greatest artists in history, and she never ceases to amaze me. This album is definitely the dance album that many fans have been waiting for. I like it because it is Madonna.   I've been hearing that people are claiming that there are hardly any references to Kabbalah, and that fortunately is untrue. There are many references to Kabbalah, but like always, unless you have a bit of knowledge you'll probably miss it.  Madonna's new album is fun, edgy, and something to dance to. But also, Madonna never stops trying to get people to think, and this album succeeds.  My favorite songs on the album are:  LIKE IT OR NOT  PUSH  ISAAC  HOW HIGH  HUNG UP    Every song is great in all its Madonna glory. A true entertainer, and thought provoker!
0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals follows the life stories of President Lincoln and his various cabinet members throughout the Civil War period.  The book particularly focuses on how Lincoln balances the conserative and radical elements in his Cabinet to allay the rivalires between members.  This allowed him to use each memeber's talents to the fullest.  Of the members of the Cabinet, the book paints a favorable picture of New Yorker, Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, and shows him as a great statesman who held Lincoln's confidence. The other favorable light was shed on Edwin M. Stanton, who focused his energies intently on managing the War Department. <br />The 2 men, who one will come away depising after reading this book, are Samuel P. Chase, who constantly whines about having his honor hurt and never realizing when he is wrong.  The other is General George McClennan, who refused to listen to orders, constantly stalled, and wrote appaling letters to his wife about the President. <br /> <br />On the whole, the book is very good for anyone looking for an in-depth study into the personalities and workings of the Union Government during the Civil War.  It makes one respect Lincoln even more by seeing all the troubles he had to face within his own government in order to defeat the Confederates.  This ability only adds to his greatness.
B000BJS4OY|4.0|The package overall is good, not excellent.  If you are using a larger box, then give me larger pictures please.  The remastered cd is truly fun to listen to.  The Making of disc is not my cup of tea.  But the real reason to buy this Set is the Concert DVD.  I don't sit and watch it, I crank it up and listen to it.  The selection of songs and their performances are vintage Springsteen.  It's a real treat to hear these songs in the proper time frame.  It's nice that there isn't 10 cameras with constant edits chopping up the video like all music video these days, but the lighting was pretty bad.  It's also a hoot to laugh at the hats!
0440241413|5.0|I read Undomestic Goddess also by Sophie Kinsella and loved it so I decided to check out the Shopaholics series.  I read this book in 3 days, I could not put it down.  It was so good and I would def. recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, romantic read.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I am strictly a hip hop fan but system of a down is one of my favorite music to listen to. This cd is amazing. I am a fan of there slower emotional songs. Some of these songs sent shivers up my spine so i definitly reccomend this cd
6305907145|4.0|Everyone has different opinions about this movie.  Yes, it is different in that the movie makers are trying to show a similarity to Jane Austen's personal life. Fanny is certainly more interesting for it.  I don't feel they went too far.   <br /> The slave sub-plot was a natural continuation of thinking about what Jane Austen was tip-toeing around. The family had been corrupted by their dealings in Antigua. Tom WAS having some kind of problem with drinking:  what was he running from?  I can also see the mother being an opium addict. <br />  I loved the Crawfords; oh, how I wanted Henry to end up with Fanny! Wouldn't he be a wonderful Wickham? I know she could have changed Henry Crawford!  <br /> This movie was much better than the recent P & P with Kiera Knightley.  In that movie, I constantly tripped over the glaring problems which interfered with me enjoying the movie.  This movie did not have that problem.  I have a collection of favorite period movies.  This will join it soon.  No, it's not perfect(will there ever be a perfect Jane AUsten film?) but I did like the casting after all. By the way, I did not like the BBC version of Manfield Park.    <br />
B000BUYP4Q|1.0|First of all: I LOVED the movie Batman Begins.  It was an amazing rebirth of the series and so much better than the last, despite the fact that I like George Clooney.  (Although I must point out what my sister said after we saw the Clooney Batman: \\"I want my superheroes to take themselves *seriously*.\\"  Which, as silly as that may sound, is exactly what Batman Begins does, and does excellently.)  Furthermore, the fact that they chose my home town of Chicago as the filmed location for the corrupt and dying Gotham City I find perversely satisfying, this city having been run on graft for so long, despite continuing efforts to root out corruption... but, hey, if they actually rooted out all the corruption and graft in Chicago (or Illinois for that matter), I seriously doubt that ANYTHING would ever get done efficiently.  It literally greases the wheels. <br /> <br />But I digress.  So I loved the film. So why the 1 star? BECAUSE I am having the same problem with Disc 2 Special Features that other reviewers have mentioned.  It simply doesn't work.  I have tried this in my two DVD players (a Sony and a Fujilink), a friend's DVD player (a Sylvania), a friend's PC (Dell Windows XP Pentium 4) and another friend's PC (a Sony VAIO desktop).  On every player and PC, the same problems mentioned by previous reviewers occurred: all you get is the anti-piracy FBI warning and the WB logo, and that's it.  I can't access ANYTHING else on the Special Features disk.  So, I'm very, very disappointed, because I also got the Extended Uncut Sin City double DVD set for xmas, and both discs work perfectly in all the DVD players I've used -- for Sin City.  I was really looking forward to the Batman Begins special features, and unfortunately, it looks like I simply can't view them.  And I am not at all certain that returning it to Amazon will result in my getting a working copy, since one reviewer already did so and his SECOND copy of Disc 2 didn't work, either.  <br /> <br />A real shame.
630518299X|5.0|In my interpretation of this interesting story, Truman is imprisoned by Christof (off Christ or Satan) in a false world with superficial relationships, but, due to his increasing  desire for truth, he crosses the \\"ocean of nescience\\" (as the Vedas would say and would also call the human body \\"a suitable boat\\" to cross with) and finds reality. At one point he appears defeated but is resurrected more or less, then he walks on water and ascends a staircase. His girlfriend, or mediator between reality and its shadow, descends a staircase to greet him.  I think it's a great story about determination to find truth and the boat crossing scene inspires me greatly.
068987474X|1.0|well, a little about me first <br />i used to be very smooth with the women, casually dating. Then my first extremely serious relationship left me burnt, after i discovered that my partner was pretty much two timing me. <br /> <br />leaving me very cautious about commitment, following year, i stepped into another relationship. the first one after that breakup. it took me a long time to get to where i was, when a couple of years down the line, along comes happily married, renown writer, Greg. now it seems that im a player, a bad boy, whos apparently \\"just not that into her\\" <br /> <br />it didnt matter that i was commited (albeit without the label) <br />it didnt matter that i wanted a future, marriage and children (albeit after i was financially established) <br />it didnt matter that we had so much history <br /> <br />what mattered was that this book told her, i was \\"just not that into her\\",  <br /> <br />i dont like being whipped, i need my time and space... and things were working out slowly for me, i really looked forward to a haapy life, a fulfilling future... <br /> <br />oh...she also threatened me with no sex... what??? <br />sex to me is something sacred. something i would only share with someone i truly love. that comment made me feel as if <br />1) sex is all i wanted <br />2) sex was the basis of our relationship <br /> <br /> <br />well... now im single again,  <br />thank you greg. we all love you. especially me. for helping taken away what could've possibly been the best thing in my life. the break that i needed. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|3.0|Allright so I was very exciting after Oral Fixation Vol. 1 and after hearing this album the excitement seemed to vanish. I definitely prefer the first of the two Oral Fixations.

B0006399FS|4.0|Ok, I've been a U2 fan for years now.  I unlike others was not hooked by the Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby.  It was the more overlooked film Rattle and Hum that pulled me in.  In reading many of these reviews I see more of the same \\"what happened to the creative U2?\\" being mentioned all too often.  Sure, I'll admit, the leaps and bounds in creativity from Joshua Tree to Achtung Baby to Zooropa to POP where huge and opened up the eyes of many listeners whether they liked it or not.  But too many people on this site have posted their belief that U2 has lost their creativity and that it is evident with \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\"  Many people think that this album, along with All That You Can't Leave Behind, is just U2 trying to fit into mainstream pop.  I challenge you to look a little deeper into this album.  Musically it is wonderful and creative such as with \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\" This song to me is very reminiscent of \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" with it's building intro that leads to a more simplistic verse just to be pumped back up at the chorus. Just the inro to this song is very spacy and thought provoking as I feel that is the point of the whole song.  I mean, how many other songs can you listen to on the radio that sounds quite like it?  \\"Love Peace or Else\\" almost has angst driven sound to it.  Should be no suprise as it is the same U2 that brought angst to \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", and \\"Exit\\" just to name a few.  Although these 5 songs just mentioned are very different, they are written with the same intensity and drive that is common between them.  Next \\"Original of the Species\\" is at the far other end of the spectrum from \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\"  It is a very simple song musically which proves to me that U2 can still fit all types of music onto one album and it still be a decent record.  Finally i'll end with \\"Vertigo\\", the song most often blamed for being a copy of the new popular rock sound of groups such as Jet, The Killers, and White Stripes for example.  It is what it is, indeed, it is very similiar, however, my feelings are a bit different than on the other negative reviews on this site.  I feel that if a band that has been playing together for so many years and covered such an unmarginal and awesome spectrum of traditional and experimental sounds can come along in 2005 and write a song like \\"Vertigo\\" and play a song such as it as well or better than other popular bands and get loads of airtime on MTV, VH1, radio, and TV Commercial Spots, sell out their tour in support of the album, I'd say they are are same old U2 we have always enjoyed.  I would say that a good listen to the album while keeping an open mind and using a few of the song reviews as I listed will show you that U2 has signs of life (even though their lyrics might not always make the most sense, but every band is guilty of this a time or two).  And, if they feel like it, I'd say they will break out another \\"Classic\\" album before they call it quits.  If the political Bono gets on your nerves, simply ignore it, the music is still great.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|I have to say if there was ever and actress fit for a role it would be Gwynneth Paltrow. An actress so many love to hate, yet in reality a good actress.<br /><br />Emma is one of those characters that has good intentions, and can be quite sweet but is maddening in her approach to things. Again somebody you'd love to hate.<br /><br />My biggest gripe ould be that it focusses too much on Emma, not on the rest of the story, which is at least as fascinating. It really took away a ot of the pleasure, Knowing there are so many more layers that are not explored and it resulted in the 3 star grade though I did enjoy watching it<br /><br />Toni Colette is a fantastic Harriet Smith, if a little old for the role. The Jane Fairfax parts are too short. The changing chemistry between her and Emma (partially guided by Mr Knightley) is much more interesting in the book.<br /><br />mrs Elton (Juliet Stevenson) is fantastically over the top, as she is in the book.<br /><br />All in all too much cramped in too little time, too much focus on Emma, which is a shame with such a fantastic cast of people
B000BVD460|3.0|you guys do realize that Em went downhill fast when Dre stopped bein involved and Em started taking over the production duties, right?
B00003JRCQ|4.0|The adaptation in many ways is faithful to the book certainly in intent. Persuasion is a relatively short book so the movie is not that long either. And in some ways that is my only objection. It feels even shorter than it is. I am not sure why. Like many Austen adaptations I feel that the movies loose some of the richness in language and personal interactions. The scenery and Bath, as in any Austen adaptation, are breathtaking.<br /><br />I found Anne father (mr Walter Elliot) and her sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, just as annoying as I expected. Specifically Elizabeth is a real nasty creature.<br />The initial discomfort between Captain Wentworth and Anne is palatable. The scene where Anne first gets to meet the Musgroves in the big house again, is very funny, very Austen. Anne's friend Mrs Smith is so nice, would have loved to have seen those scenes expanded a bit.<br /><br />All in all an enjoyable evening when watching this, but the book certainly wins hands down.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|This movie has been a very romantic enlightening experience of my heart. <br /> <br /> <br />Wonderful <br /> <br />Emotional <br /> <br />Passionate  <br /> <br />Funny <br /> <br /> <br />& Most of all REAL!! <br /> <br /> <br />A+ for all of us hopeless romantics out there!! I just hope more movies like this one will appear in the future! XXOOX
B0007OY2P8|4.0|I loved this movie, The movie can be a bit confusing due to dream sequences, What is real and what is not but that just keeps you focussed on the story.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is not as clear cut as some other Austen adaptations.<br /><br />There is more that is happening under the surface than you initially see. It definately has a haunted feel to it. It is Austens spoof on a Gothic Novel, hence the movie is a strange mixture of over teh top romance and over the top classic gothic horror and it works.<br /><br />Catherine is a fan of Gothic Novels (think Mary Shelley, though she favours the now lesser well known Radcliff) and has the very vivid imagination of a teenager.<br /><br />Robert Hardy is magnificent in his role. I'd be scared of him as well.<br /><br />My biggest issue. Catherine is portrayed as a bit too sweet and twee, I like Eleanor better and she is not the heroine.
B000957O82|5.0|I have to say I have always enjoyed Will Smith, but this is one of his best roles. A special romantic comedy that most couples will love. An excellent date movie. I think even kids will probably find parts of this amusing. His co-star Eva Mendes is not only beautiful, but does a wonderful performance as his romantic interest that very much has a mind of her own. Support roles by Kevin James and others are outstanding and make this an above par look at the rigors of dating. It covers all the bases of how to pick someone up without pickup lines to dancing without looking like a fool. If you enjoy the romantic movies without the fluff like \\"50 First Dates\\", you should like this one. This movie will make you laugh and cry. It genuinely touches the heart and funny bone. Great acting, script, locations, camera work, and music make this a keeper. Get it!
0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones,\\" written by Alice Sebold, is about a teenage girl named Suzie. She gets raped and murdered on her way home from school, after being lured into a strange neighbors backyard. I thought this book was very interesting in the way the story was told. It's told from Suzie's point of view from heaven, and she explains what her life is like after her death. It makes the book a lot more interesting by telling the story this way. It gives the reader a lot bigger picture of what is happening on earth, then if any other character told it. Suzie watches as her loved ones on earth, deal with her death. Also, how the police try and gather all the information they can to solve her murder case. I did, however, think there were some parts of the book that dragged on. I still felt the book was very captivating. \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" is somewhat realistic, and not too farfetched. During most of the book, I could relate to the main character by wanting to help the police catch the murderer and be there for her family. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in murder cases and how family's fall apart, or come together in their time of need.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Man I heard just two songs on that album which are \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Hung\\" and I was in love with this album.  Madonna songs on this album brings back the feel and aura of a hot danceclub on a Friday night. Hearing her songs on this album reminds me of the smoke filled, dark underground dive club, with the fine women dancing and the only light are just candles on the bar and guest tables.  The aura of the smoke and the deejay in the background spinning and mixing his beats and everybody dancing and having a good time.  This album that Madonna made here EXCELLENTLY captures the aura, the flirtation, the sexual tension of a hot danceclub on a hot Friday night.  <br /> <br />I salute Madonna for making such an excellent album.  This is the best album since her Immaculate Conception and Ray of Light albums.  Man at her age this woman can still jam!!!
B0000029AL|5.0|I hadn't heard this record for 25+ years but for some reason bought it recently.  I don't give this record 5 stars because it's perfect because it's definitely not.  Production quality is almost like a demo tape, some of the leads are oddly out of step and awkward.  But I give it 5 because even so I can't stop listening to it and can't get it out of my head.  This record at its best feels like a group of inspired young rockers doing what they really love, and gets its barroom groove on in a way that makes me say \\"they just don't make music like this any more.\\"   <br /> <br />Make It and Somebody are just pretty good in my opinion, out-of-date for sure.  Dream On is itself a perfect rock song, but even though it's probably the song that put Aerosmith on the map in the 70s, I've heard it so many times it's not the one I really want to listen to.  It's One Way Street, Mama Kin, and Write Me that I really love and come back to over and over.  One Way Street is a rocky RnB number that's big on rythm and vocals.  Mama Kin centers around a simple but classic rythm guitar riff.  Write Me is straight up blues-based rock, heavy on drums, big guitar chords, and vocals.  I don't know what it is, but those 3 songs combined deliver a sound and feel that epitomize what I respond to in music, and keep this disc on the top of my stack.  Movin Out is somewhat cool for the right mood, but can get tiresome.  Walkin the dog shows one of the finest examples of \\"Aerosmithization\\" of a classic blues riff.
0765309408|5.0|I've been a huge fan of John Scalzi ever since I started reading his blog \\"Whatever\\" several years ago. I was apprehensive when I heard that he was publishing a science fiction novel -- but then I read it and was thrilled and relieved. <br /> <br />Boy can *write*. Damn! Likeable characters, an intriguing storyline, and a plethora of original ideas. (Scalzi must have been feeding the idea fairies on his back porch something extra special). Now I just have to get my hands and eyes on The Ghost Brigades because I need more of this universe.
1891252089|5.0|David Swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal Ashtanga practice.  I have been doing Ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by David's Primary Series DVD and this book since I first began my practice.<br /><br />For anyone who does not have Ashtanga experience, cannot find a teacher in their area or want to practice outside of a yoga class, David's DVDs are incredible and instructive.  This book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace.<br /><br />This book is also phenomenal for those experienced in Ashtanga who want to create a Mysore practice.  A Mysore practice is a quiet practice.  The only sound is your breath, while you go through the sequence at your own pace.  It's a profound opportunity to \\"hear your own voice\\" and in my experience, builds a deep inner trust.  Swenson's book not only lets you look at one asana at a time, but it also provides an \\"at-a-glance\\" sequence for a kind of \\"cliff notes\\" effect.  This was excellent to have by my mat as a reminder of the sequence while creating my at-home Mysore practice.<br /><br />I have had the great fortune to take a class and teacher training with David Swenson.  He has a down-to-earth style, humor and an incredible knowledge of Ashtanga that shines through in his book and DVDs.  I highly recommend his work to anyone interested in Ashtanga yoga.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I like Britney a lot, at least her music. She may be something of a b**ch, but who the hell cares? She has good songs and is quite beautiful. There are a lot of good songs on this CD, with good tunes and lyrics, and Britney's voice is a whole lot better than any CDs of hers I've heard before. Oh, and I know on one site I wrote an intense and ruthless hatred of her. I don't love Britney, but I do not hate her, either, especially that much. So I can't believe I did that stupid crap mentioned above. Whatever, this is a good CD, and Britney is one of my favorite artists of all time. The two best songs on this CD, though there are many good ones, are \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" in which Britney tells how she will never want to be without or stop loving whatever man she's singing it about, and \\"Overprotected\\" in which she tells the frustrations of her life growing up, how she wants to get things back together, and most of all how she wants to live independently. There are other  good songs on here, as said, but these are the two greatest. Anyway, if you like female celebrities, buy this album. It is minus one star only because she's done better on other albums.
B00007LTIG|5.0|The fast spontaneous furious speed of this 1st album from the seminal improvisational band is nothing less than a spectacular experience far ahead of it's time.<br />The Dead were fine musicians, always respected and paid homage to their influences by developing a unique hybrid of traditional blues and country,folk,jug and rock and roll within in a jazz setting.<br />Creating a new form emulated by so many of their contemporaries within rock may not have been their intention, but that is a defining element of their historical importance.<br />The sense of immediacy and existential NOW is keenly felt here.<br />Even the few tracks clocked in at 5 minutes or higher have a primal energy to it and is danceable..The beauty of this album is that it totally debunks the notion that the Dead were a jam band only and were not capable of laying down great songs in time spans under 3 minutes.They knew how to have a good time..<br /><br />This CD features so many in concert staples later stretched out into what became Dead Head music listening to it again with the extra tracks and hdcd is very refreshing.<br />The homage paid to their wide musical roots and upping it by creating dynamic interesting music interplaying in 1967 double guitars and later a dual drum attack into some unique synthesis<br />that is both old and new was and is a rare accomplishment.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|I've seen this movie twice now.  It's a movie about Michael Alig who started the club kid craze in New York started in the 80's.  The movie shows how drugs can destroy someone who although outrageous was actually very good at what he was trying to do.  Culkin picked a great role to return to acting with.  What a remarkable performance.  I would be remiss though in not also praising Seth Green for his performance as James St. James.  James is the person that actually trained Alig on how to be a club kid.  The movie shows the rise and ultimate demise of Michael Alig.  It's a very sad tragic movie.  The acting was mesmerizing.  The second time I saw it was on I didn't plan on watching it again as I wasn't in the mood for a sad movie, but again once started I was so mesmerized by the acting performances I watched the entire thing again.  It was actually better the second time.  I would definitely suggest giving this move a look see.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|When I saw \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in theatres, I was immediately struck by the opening music, and I enjoyed the score throughout the whole film. I'm a big collector of soundtracks and scores, and this is one of the most beautiful ones I own. As is the case with most soundtracks, I think it adds to the music if you've seen the movie, but even if you haven't, you can still appreciate this score. I loved the movie and so my favorite tracks are the ones from some of my favorite scenes (usually involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy!) \\"Dawn,\\" \\"Stars and Butterflies,\\" \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell,\\" \\"Liz On Top of the World,\\" \\"Your Hands Are Cold,\\" and \\"Mrs. Darcy\\" are some of my favorites. This is really beautiful music.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Short review here so everyone reads: <br />Serenity is #3 in DVD sales on Amazon with over 1,000 reviews <br />Firefly (the TV series)is #5 on Amazon with over 500 reviews <br /> <br />Universal Studios did the Movie, not Fox <br />Joss Whedon is going to make a boat-load of money - Good for him, too bad for FOX. Would be nice to see the series back on HBO, cable etc. Fox would probably canceled it again.
B00000GBHA|5.0|Other reviews on this page describe the music. I write to say that this music is drawn from that hidden universal stream from which all truth and great art emanate and from which only they who have transcended the human condition may reach into with their ladle to fill our barren bowls. Humanity has served up many such messengers across the ages, poets, painters artists and musicians. Rodriguez is just such a man. Other reviews have compared him to Dylan especially, and this is understandable I suppose if you're looking for a shortcut to explain in words just what this music may be like, but believe me, this is no Dylanite - Rodrigues is every bit an original..and his songs are very much his own and so too his sound - the imagery of his lyrics is every bit as superb as Dylan at his best perhaps better, the messages powerful and inspired, these songs will move you, and because the themes are so universal and the music itself so honest, this is a timeless album which meets all the criteria of a masterpiece. If this were not enough, the music is infinitely listenable...I've been fortunate enough to have known this music since 1975 and I just never get tired of it because you can't get tired of masterpieces, they have that perfect blend of magic that keeps us forever spellbound and if I could only keep 10 cds, this will always be one of them no matter how many more cds they ever press. This is not Dylan or Young or Cohen.. this is Rodriguez as himself.  To Mr. Rodriguez I say thank you on behalf of two generations of South Africans. God bless you.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Seems like most rate this with 5 stars or 1 star.  I find the 1 star reviews more interesting to read.  Critically I don't know if this album is good or bad...I don't care. I like it.  JM can play the guitar and now that I know it I will pay more attention to him.   The dudes playing bass and drums are top shelf guys.  I wonder if Mayer came on the scene with an blues/rock album like this, would he be as popular?  He ain't Clapton, yet.  But Clapton is a guy that can be as much blues/rock as anyone.  He can also dish out some sappy stuff, too.  I hope John Mayer puts out more music like this with his Trio.
0517548232|4.0|Author Henry Hazlitt is definitely a member of the non- government interventionist society, when it comes to economics. He doesn't advocate the elimination of all levels of government in the economy, only those that are undeniably counter- productive and even destructive. He definitely would not get along very well with Keynesian economists.<br /><br />I like the examples that Hazlitt uses in this book, because they make it very easy to understand exactly what he is talking about. This is very helpful to readers who may not have much understanding of economics.<br /><br />Hazlitt avoids talking about statistics and he doesn't utilize graphic illustrations. I think some graphs would have been helpful, because it makes the points easy to visualize. But I think the reason that Hazlitt avoids graphs and statistics is because he wanted this book to be timeless. True, the book has undergone several revisions over the years, but the basic information and the debunking of economic myths that held true 50 years ago still hold true today.<br /><br />Another thing that makes this book and easy one to read is the way Hazlitt divides the book into so many short chapters. The total length of this book is only 214 pages, yet it includes 26 chapters. That makes each chapter only about 8 pages in length, on average. Some are very short, like chapter 2 (the one on the broken window) which is only 2 pages in length. Keep in mind that Hazlitt didn't intend this book to be an argumentative analysis on the pros and cons of government intervention. He only meant to show the reader exactly what happens, when government sticks its ugly head into areas where it doesn't belong, and how these actions are detrimental to the overall economy over time. They might seem helpful in the short run, but they are destructive in the long run.<br /><br />If there is one lesson that Hazlitt tries to drive home in this book, it's the tendency of people to be short- sighted when they evaluate the ramifications of government involvement in the economy; and the almost universal tendency to only see one side of the issue. For example, with tariffs, we are all fooled by politicians into supporting them because we think about the jobs that will be saved. We don't even think about the higher prices that will result from the tariff, which must be borne by the people who purchase the product. We don't think about the jobs that will be lost by other industries that would have received our extra money, had we not been forced to pay the higher price that the tariff resulted in. We see the trees, but not the forest.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book to read by anyone who would like to see these common economic myths proven wrong. Don't be misled by the book's title. This is not a basic economic theory book. It's a book about the negative effects of government intervention in the economy, and it does an effective job in exposing these myths.ns of government involvement in the economy; and the almost universal tendency to only see one side of the issue.

B00005JOII|4.0|Director Woody Allen in a departure from his usual New York City based Bergmanesque style existential films, \\"Match Point\\" proves to be an intriguing film based on a tangled and convoluted series of relationships.<br /><br />Tennis pro Chris Wilton played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers gets involved with Chloe Hewitt played by Emily Mortimer, daughter of a wealthy English financial maven played by Brian Cox.  Wilton had been introduced by his student and Chloe's brother Tom played by Matthew Goode.  Rhys Meyer's is adored by the Hewitt family and a union with daughter Chloe is heartily accepted.  He is offered an important position in the the elder Hewitt's firm, more than securing his future.<br /><br />There is however trouble in paradise for Rhys Meyers.  Brother Tom is courting American aspiring actress Nola Rice played by an alluring Scarlett Johansson.

B00005JGAB|5.0|I first heard the Ramones debut record in early 1977, shortly after reading a review of them in a music magazine (I think it might have been Trouser Press or perhaps Hit Parader) when I was 15, and I was blown away by its stripped down sound. Hearing them made me an instant fan, as I suspect it did for many others. I remember just loving the Ramones' sound and their twisted sense of humor, not to mention their look (kudos to Roberta Bayley and Arturo Vega for the band photos), and beginning with them, embracing the punk revolution as a breath of fresh air. Here indeed was a band for kid who grew up on Mad Magazine, Famous Monsters of Filmland, comic books, Ed Sullivan, and late 60s bubblegum, and who came of age in the middle of the anomic 1970s.<br /><br />Here the Ramones are sounding extremely stripped down and raw. Recorded for just a few thousand bucks (cheap even by mid 70s prices) the raw sound is a perfect compliment to these songs - some of the Ramones great classics. Songs like Blitzkrieg Bop, Beat on the Brat, 53rd and 3rd, and I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You have well stood the test of time. And with a cover of the oldies song Let's Dance, the Ramones link themselves to rock's glorious past, its transistor radio era.<br /><br />In short what we have here is the start of a musical/cultural revolution.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of seeing the Ramones live twice (once in 1978, with a teenage Joan Jett and the Runaways the opening band). They were just as incredible live as they were on record. I also remember the thrill of running into Joey Ramone in lower Manhattan one afternoon; I wish I still had the autograph which I got from him, but it's gone. At least though I still have my records.
0307276902|3.0|I was given this book by someone who absolutely loved it.  For me, it didn't live up to the hype.  For starters, the stream-of-concious writing style gets tiresome very quickly.  Also, the book lacks credibility.  Supposedly, the author is in the violent stages of addiction and withdrawal but he narrates with incredible detail about events as if he were completely lucid and writing them right after they happened.  When exactly did he write this book?  Also (and this is a nit), the author seems bent on conveying to us how tough he is - almost as if that's the point of the book.  Interesting anecdotes and a voyeuristic peek into rehab.  Just not credible.  And a little structure to the writing would go a long way.
B000077VR3|5.0|When I was ten, I first saw \\"Titanic\\".  I can tell you right here and now that thats going to be a hard one to forget. I have never seen, nor expect to see, a movie that fills you with so much raw emotion again.  Maybe \\"Moulin Rouge\\" wasn't quite as good as that, but it's pretty high up there on the pedestel.  Simply put, I loved this movie.  I loved the music, I loved the dancing, I loved the acting, and I really loved the story.  This is not my first film by this director.  I also own \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  From this previous movie, I knew \\"Moulin Rouge\\" would be a little out there- I think that really helped the story.  This movie was very sad, and I would have LOVED a happier ending. However, I understand that that probably would have been predictable- and that just wouldn't have been \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  So go out it and buy.  Maybe it isn't exactly what you think you'd enjoy, but trust me, this is another one of those \\"unforgettable\\" movies.  I hope that I've been able to help sway your minds, even if just a little bit.
B000002JNJ|3.0|This disc is definately not as good as people say. I guess if you havent listened to any of Metallicas early albums this cd might sound ok but........i just dont think  its all that great. Dont get me wrong Dimebag Darrel was a killer guitarist and created some really awesome guitar riffs. Especially on the first track of this cd: \\"Cowboys From Hell.\\"  If you want some real good heavy music check out some of Metallicas earlty stuff. I start off by listening to \\"And Justice For All...\\" or \\"Master of the Puppets.\\" Any of metallicas early stuff would be good to listen to, but these are the albums that originally drew me into Metallica. My favorite metallica album is \\"Ride the Lightening.\\" Basically it would be best to save your money or buy a metallica cd.  If you already own all of the early metallica cds go ahead and check this out. You'll see what i mean when i say THIS CD IS NOT GREAT!  but it is okay.    P.S. People have told me that \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is a much better Pantera cd. I dont really know, so i think i might check that out if i were you. I am. Well, good luck buying your Pantera cd!
074322454X|3.0|Ambrose deserves 4 stars for research and 2 stars for writing, which explains my rating of 3. The subject is stirring, but the writing is melodramatic and subjective. Ambrose makes remarks that cannot possibly be verified. For example, he states that the men of Easy Company were in better shape than professional prizefighters and football players. How does he know that? Did he interview a boxer from that time period? Did he have a soldier and a football player run a race to see who could run fastest and the longest? In another instance, referring to an incident where an Easy soldier tried to woo a woman, he concludes, \\"Had Reese been a Soviet, German, or Japanese soldier, this nonincident probably would have turned out differently\\" (258). In other words, Ambrose insinuates that almost every Soviet, German, and Japanese soldier raped women, while of course Americans rarely did. Where are the statistics to support that bigoted claim? On one hand, Ambrose succeeds in relating the experiences of Easy Company; on the other hand, he fails to live up to journalistic integrity.

B0001LJC2K|3.0|Please stop comparing this band favorably to Radiohead based on the vocal range of Bellamy compared to Yorke. Yorke's vocal skills are not the reason Radiohead is amazing, just as Lennon's, Jagger's, or Dylan's  range isn't the reason they made some of the greatest albums in history. If you want vocal range buy an old Steelheart album or some other crap. Don't get me wrong though, this band is pretty good, they're just not Radiohead, and I didn't ask them to be.
0767805712|2.0|I bougth this title after reading much praise. Personally I am very disappointed. Concept is good but treatment is bad. First half was superb. However, direction and story lost the track in second half.
B0007OCG56|2.0|This film is a mess. It's not very funny. The highlight is Chloris Leachman. The rest is awful.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is arguably Metallica's best and i wouldnt argue about that. Its extremely fast and heavy and everything a metal or rock fan could want.  <br />This is how i rate RIDE THE LIGHTENING <br /> <br />1. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE: Blindingly fast intro song! At the bginning they fool you into thinking the song is a slow acoustic song , then WAM extreme fast metal. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. RIDE THE LIGHTENING: A great follow up song to fight fire with fire. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS: Very melodic song and its heavy! Everything is just so perfect about this song. 10/10/ <br /> <br />4. FADE TO BLACK: This song has really beautiful guitar playing, one listen and your hooked. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. TRAPPED UNDER ICE: fast and heavy. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. ESCAPE: Very cool song. At times it seems as if Hetfield is singing almost in the style of Rob Halford of Judas Priest.(the style halford uses when hes not screeching vocals) 10/10 <br /> <br />7. CREEPING DEATH: An awesome rocker! 10/10 <br /> <br />8. CALL OF THE KTULU: Perfect closer for the cd! 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />I think any metallica ofr metal fan should own this cd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BNI90O|4.0|I have listened to the CD's and I love them.  The set went beyond my expectations.  One problem.  I have an ipod, and would like to be able to use it with this set, and I cannot.  I understand the reason for anti-piracy software, but why punish the honest?  That is the only reason this gets a 4 out of five stars from me.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Wow, I remember listening this for the first time, when I was 14 years old, and thought, this is cool, nothing I heard before, but it is good. And sure it was, it fine tuned my taste in music from that day forward enabling me to enjoy pure rock 'n' roll as it should be, raw, powerfull and fast. <br /> <br />Thanks to Ramones we still have decent music around. People can't imagine importance of this album for the history/future of R'n'R. <br /> <br />If you don't already have this album, I mean... come on... buy it now. This is one in maybe five albums in rock history that should be owned by all cost. <br /> <br />I have this one on cassette, Vinil and CD
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Collateral may well be the single most ridiculous and utterly absurd screenplay ever put into production by a major studio in this century. While the inexplicable critical praise for the film might be expected to result in some failure to live up to expectations, this fails on even the most basic levels of construction for the very dumbest of action movies - and this certainly is the dumbest piece of hokum I've seen in the past ten years. I'm simply at a loss as to how anyone could think this thrill-free thriller even a competent piece of drama, let alone a masterpiece.<br /><br />One of the problems with people who make more than one good movie is that we very unreasonably expect them to keep on making good movies instead of just being grateful for what they've given us in the past. So I'll go on being<br />grateful to Mann for Manhunter, Heat, The Insider, The Jericho Mile and Last of the Mohicans (even if he is determined to re-edit the heart out of them if left unchecked) and mark this one down as a paycheck. It's just a shame that, unlike Terrence Malick, nobody set up a trust fund for him so that he wouldn't have to make movies this bad just to pay the bills.<br /><br />The film starts off with a disadvantage - the high concept setup is a hard premise to sell, and the film singularly fails to do so. But instead of going off in the `we know this is stupid, but let's have fun with it' route, instead it tries to play it as serious psychodrama and character piece while offering some of the most ridiculous plotting imaginable.<br /><br />Cruise is supposedly a top of his game hitman, but is the most spectacularly inept killer the screen has ever seen, revealing himself to dozens of witnesses, beating up and shooting people in crowded nightclubs (the film's utter lowpoint) and even accompanying his reluctant chauffeur on a visit to his mother in hospital. Short of taking over a Presidential press conference at gunpoint, it's hard to imagine him drawing more attention to himself in almost every single scene. By the final reel when he turns into an indestructible relentless Tominator stalking the pair, you suddenly start to appreciate the finely crafted plots and elegant dialogue found in the works of Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Olivier Gruner, none of whom have ever descended to such preposterous lows. It's notable that Jason Statham kept his name off the credits in this one, and he had no such qualms over Revolver.<br /><br />By the time the unbelievable coincidence of the passenger Foxx falls for being - shock, horror - the last name on the list is wheeled on, we've sat through so many much more unbelievable coincidences and idiotic lapses in logic and credibility that it almost seems rational. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this is just taking the piss.<br /><br />Not that faulty suspension is the only thing wrong with this vehicle. None of the individual scenes ever convince or work on their own terms, with every development or line of dialog not just horribly telegraphed but practically written in the sky. Characterization is equally facile and predictable, with only vague moments hinting at possibilities glossed over en route to the next botched setpiece. The performances are variable: Cruise, Foxx, Javier Bardem and, most surprisingly, Jada Pinkett Smith are fine but not outstanding, but Mark Ruffalo becomes increasingly laughable as it becomes ever clearer that the depth of his characterization extends to doing a not very good John Travolta/Chilli Palmer impersonation.<br /><br />I take no pleasure in writing off this utter trainwreck of a movie. There could have been a good little straight-to-video movie in this, but the end result is a completely unacceptable piece of junk that goes straight into my All-time Ten Worst list. Garbage.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Yes, the majority agree..preferably the people that \\"know music\\" that this is a very very good album and a breath of fresh air to the music industry. I had never heard 30 seconds until a few weeks ago, with the single \\"ill attack\\" on a popular radio station. And from there this music just grew on me. I purchased the album a few days later. Perhaps they will not get the recongnition they deserve because of the particular sound they do have but Jared Letto has a outstanding voice and his lyrics, melodies, the chourus', the verses..everything is great. Although the album tones down after the initial song ill attack and i dont appreciate the bonus tracks too much either..but you cant complain. Great second effort! and looking foward towards the third! ..about the content protection, i didnt have a problem copying the songs to my computer at all.
B000002H97|4.0|The Black Album is underated, but is still a great album. If you already own all of Metallica's stuff before this then you should definately check it out. It is no where near as mgood as any of their previous material but is a really great listen. If your a Metallica fan you should probably own this album.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I love Chinese movies and this is one of my top ten favorites.  It's a simple story of how a man's parents met and fell in love, but it's also one of the best films I've seen. The acting, photography, and setting work together to create a memorable movie. This is a perfect rainy Sunday afternoon film. Be sure to watch it in the orignal Chinese with English subtitles to get the full effect.
B000002VC5|5.0|I Robot is my personal favorite of all Parsons albums, in part because it is the concept album in its perfect form.  The opener, I Robot, is an outstanding instrumental, perhaps his second best (Lucifer destroys all competition).  I Wouldn't Want to be Like You is an excellent song, my second most played of all the Parsons songs I own.  If listened to through headphones, the beginning of I Wouldn't Want to be Like You is very cool.  The sound switches between earpieces, and the effect sounds amazing.   <br /> <br />Breakdown has excellent potential, and would be a five star song up with the first two and next two if it weren't for the \\"Freedom Freedom\\" garbage.  At this point, the song just breaks down completely. <br /> <br />Some Other Time is a great song for the album and a great song on its own.  Don't Let it Show is another excellent song, one of my favorite Parsons songs.  The Voice is the track that best fits the concept, and is a good song on its own.  However, the clapping doesn't work.  I have heard the suggestion that the clapping represents a monotonous Orwellian society (think 1984), but I don't see it. <br /> <br />Nucleus is a good instrumental that sets the mood of the album, but is not particularly interesting on its own.  Day After Day is a very good song, followed by the eerie Total Eclipse.  Finally, Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32 closes the album with an instrumental that better than the previous two. <br /> <br />Listening to the album carefully reveals that each song, especially on the second half of the CD, flows into the next.  This is an excellent experience, full of great songs. <br /> <br />Beware the Robots!
B000000OUJ|5.0|Some say its the best Wu individual release. I say it is the best. Some still don't know about this album. Those naysayers that don't think this is one of the best cd's of all times.. well it was a tape when I was coming up. I am sure they are a fan of and a believer that Lil Flip LL or 50 or somebody like that is the greatest of all time. You know they believe in some false profit like that. Please put the flying guillotines away and know that some people are still analog. We Wu heads are too digital. In the words of Bobby Digital..That reminds me I need to write a review for that too. It gets no better than the first releases for the Wu.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Mezmerize is part one of a two part album released by system of a down in 2005. This was truly a remarkable year for this band and their fans. They relased two albums, both of which have debuted at number one on billboard charts and gone on to platinum status. They also have received a grammy nod for BYOB, for Best hard rock performance I believe. This album truly does as it is entitled, MEZMERIZE. All the songs are very progressive and even cathcy. Their first single is a pretty good example where they blend thrash metal lyrics(\\"Why do they always send the poor!\\") to cathcy, even poppy lyrics(\\"Everybodys going to the party have a real good time\\") all in the same song and pull it off. Other great examples of this are songs like \\"Radio/video\\", \\"Violent pornagraphy\\", and \\"Cigaro\\". But they also show their classic SOAD sound on songs like \\"Sad statue\\" and \\"Lost in hollywood\\" which also has humurous lyrics piled on top of a heartfelt song. But lets get to the good stuff. Here is the Track by track review:    1. Soldier Side-(8/10)-They start off their Epic masterpiece (Mezmerize/Hypnotize) by foreshadowing Hypnotize's final song \\"Soldier side\\". This is just a small sample of it and gets you ready for whats to come...    2 B.Y.O.B- (10/10)- This is systems most cathcy yet polictical songs to date. And also may add overplayed but great songs always get over played so It is expected.    3. Revenga-(10/10)- This song is all over the place If you ask me. From the verse rants of \\"MY SWEET CLEMENTINE!\\" to darons slow dwelling \\"I saw her face, and she said go away\\" and back to Serj and darons chorus catch \\"My sweet Revenge\\".     4. Cigaro-(10/10)- I consider this Darons size obsessed Ballad. It is quite humoress and is definitly a SAOD classic for years to come. Daron's guitar riff really kicks *ss here.    5. Radio/Video-(10/10)- The rythme of this song is awesome. Serj and Darons harmonious vocal performance is uncanning to any other on this LP. They start up heavy then slowit down, then speed it up, and slow it down. This song is a roller coaster.    6. This Cocaine makes me feel like in on this song-(10/10)- An odd title but a straight up thrashing rock tune. I personally enjoy Serj's piano bit in the end while he's goin bizerk.     7. Violent Pornography-(10/10)- One of my personal favorites on the album. Its a song about Porn, Tv, Brainwashing....and nabisco?     8. Question!-(10/10)-The 2nd single. This was a great way to show the other side of mezmerize. A pretty briliant song.Lyrics really capture the moment.    9. Sad Statue-(10/10)- A Melody mashed with hard hitten lyrics that define our generation. \\"You and me we'll all go down in history with a sad statue of libery and a generation that didn't agree\\" - One of SOAD's best lyrics.    10. Old School Hollywood-(10/10)- A gastrically weird song. At first I have no Idea what these fellas are talking about. Hollywood basebal, tony danza, I couldnt make ther connection. The I Found out it was about Daron seeing tony danze and other washed up actors at a dodgers game. Still a bit of a weird topic, Old school hollywood actors at a baseball game. But it truly is excellent art.    11. Lost in Hollywood-(10/10)-The slow song on the album. Its about being betrayed by hollywood and getting lost in the glitz and glam of it all. Daron thorws in some humorous lyrics such as \\" All you maggots smokin Fags on santa monica boulevard. By fags he means cigarettes...    Final words: One of the best Lps of 05. If you have this you must get hypnotize. Once you have listned to both you will get the connection and see what SOAD was trying to accomplish. Just dont get lost in hollywood.....
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Okay, \\"Philadelphia\\" what can be said about it ?When i first seen it... I was moved and it made me think-- while watching the opera scene & Tom's funeral and seeing him as a child  ( not only those both scenes made the movie) but made me think about \\"god, he looked so innocent & happy\\" and how scary it is to grow up in a world so cold & unkind. Also the opera scene gave me goosebumps as Tom hank explain what the arist was talking about...How beautifull and emotional was watching Denzels reaction. Neil young's \\"philadelphia\\" is possibly one of the most beautifull song i've ever heard & it realy brought me peace. If you decide to rent \\"philadelphia\\" ? Think about what i said and also how truly beautifull Antonio & Hanks relationship was with so much love and how sad was for Antonio \\"Miguel\\" knowing that his bestfriend, lover and companion could die at any moment. ::sigh:: Just watch it.
B00064WSNW|5.0|if you pick up this album, take the effort to totally step out of the sound and image of the band's legendary first album. this is not the court of the crimson king (and if that's the basis of your interest in this album, you're bound to be disappointed), but it is great music in its own right. <br /> <br />in contrast to the operatic prog bombast and moodiness of the first album, discipline is a totally different cup of tea inspired by images of africa and dominated by guitar wizard adrian belew fresh from his outings with talking heads/brian eno - the remarkable 'remain in light' - and heavily influenced by david bryne's vocal delivery, which itself is the exact opposite of the melancholy magnificence of greg lake's vocals in tcotck. fripp apparently wanted to call the band itself \\"discipline\\", but somehow the tag of \\"king crimson\\" was retained. soulful ballads interspersed with manic funk, layered with sinuous lead guitar duels, courtesy fripp and belew, characterises this album. bill bruford's \\"batterie\\", as subtle and powerful as ever, and tony levin's funky exploring bass, form the formidable rhythym section for the axemen to work on. fripp is still the brain behind the scenes, guiding and directing and his evolution as a musician/producer influenced by brain eno, is marked here. elephant talk, matte kudasai, the hilarious indiscipline, the sheltering sky are the highlights in this album. this album is as unique as it gets - never heard anything like this before or after!
B000056NX5|1.0|I'm sorry, but I can not agree with some of the reviews that I just read about this film.  I grew up idolizing Ian Gillan's voice.  Glenn Carter doesn't even come close.  He uses a falsseto for many of the once famous power screams and F sharps that where so overwhelming.  I know that there is only one Ian, but folks, a falsseto in leiu of a power scream is wrong.  He shouldn't have even tried.  I would have had more respect if he just sang it in his full voice and stayed within his range.  The new scenery doesn't bother me.  I can understand the artisitic approach, but if your expecting Jesus to come off like Ian Gillan or even Ted Neeley, you are going to be greatly disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really was skeptical when before I tried to watch Firefly, I mean I never thought the creator of Buffy and Angel could pull of a great Sci-fi series, but man was I wrong. Firefly maybe short, but it surely is sweet. I love the combination of western mixed with science fiction. The characters in this series are very likeable, each different in many ways. The episodes, while some have been done before on other Sci-fi series, are exciting and still fun to watch. And the ship \\"Serenity\\" herself is quite a ship.<br /><br />The thing that impresses most about this series is how realistic the show seems. It's set 500 years and the future, and instead of phasers like on Trek, they are still using basic guns like we have now. Another thing that is realistic is how the scenes in space are quiet since no sound is in outer space. Overall, this is a great series. I'm a Trekkie and I love this series. I still haven't seen Serenity but after watching this series, it's a given that I have to buy Serenity!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I can understand how many people enjoy A Rush of Blood to the Head more, but I prefer X&Y for several reasons: <br /> <br />1) great choruses in tracks like \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Low\\" <br /> <br />2) awesome guitar solos in \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"X&Y\\", and \\"A Message\\" (and a rare wine-glass solo in \\"Low\\") <br /> <br />3) satisfying endings: helter-skelter (\\"What If\\"), synthesizer (\\"White Shadows\\"), orchestral (\\"X&Y\\"), instramental (\\"The Hardest Part\\"), and dramatic cut-off (\\"Twisted Logic\\") <br /> <br />4) \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"--beautiful song <br /> <br />Oh, and I didn't have any technical problems with the CD.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is a great Movie Soundtrack!. I'm a PASSPORT Fan since I was a kid back in the 70's. I have all Klaus Doldinger's official releases with his Passport signature. Please go and look for this CD \\"Running In Real Time\\" from Passport and listen to track number 2: Auryn. Then go and get all his Passport releases (almost 20 CDs since the 70's). Then you will see why Klaus Doldinger is very creative.
B000002J23|5.0|this album imo is easily the most underappreciated album in the history of rock!     trevor horn and geoff downes might not be jon anderson and rick wakeman, (and it is not as if every album with anderson and wakeman is good!), but they're great musicians in their own right.     and it shows on the album. almost every track is great on this - especially 'machine messiah', 'into the lens' and 'run through the light'.     the album is harder edged than the normal \\"yes\\", but the band somehow successfully reconciles the heaviness with the melody and so the music literally soars on each track. and i love trevor horn's voice which imo is very unique - it is easily the most refreshing, pleasant yet rich vocals i've ever heard.     great great great album this! get this if you're above personality cults and like good music!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie has what the original movie lacked and the book had in spades, a dark side.  Mr. Dahl never writes down at children and neither does this movie.  Totally crazy and great.  Johnny Deep does a great job at being lovable and creepy.  Give the movie a go.  I really can't believe it only ahve 4 stars right now.

020530902X|3.0|When I first encountered this book around 1962, I thought the world of it.  It was not only filled with pithy pearls of writing advice -- pretty much all of which are just as true today -- but it also included many, many comments on specifics of how to use certain words, phrasing, and punctuation.<br /><br />I have owned and happily used this book in the interim, all the while realizing that as the language has slowly evolved, the book did not evolve along with it.<br /><br />The \\"updated\\" version, edited by Roger Angell, was, I thought, supposed to remedy this situation.<br /><br />Alas, whatever \\"updating\\" he performed, other than adding a new forward and perhaps fixing a couple of typos, is entirely invisible to me.  As an editor who is deeply involved with the nuances of language, I feel this book should be perceived as an embarrassment to both Angell and the publishers.<br /><br />Virtually nothing was done to keep the book abreast of changes in usage over all these years.  Time and again one encounters what were mainstream usages recommended in 1962 that have become quasi-archaisms by the time this \\"Fourth Edition\\" was published.<br /><br />Probably Angell was afraid to tamper with what has been widely acclaimed as a masterwork. (And if you read only the general advice about writing and ignore the comments about specific usages, it still is.)<br /><br />In not tampering with the book, he has ironically caused it to deteriorate, eroded by the undertow of time.<br /><br />(Fortunately, this damage is reversible.

B00009Z576|5.0|this album imo is easily the most underappreciated album in the history of rock!    trevor horn and geoff downes might not be jon anderson and rick wakeman, (and it is not as if every album with anderson and wakeman is good!), but they're great musicians in their own right.    and it shows on the album. almost every track is great on this - especially 'machine messiah', 'into the lens' and 'run through the light'.    the album is harder edged than the normal \\"yes\\", but the band somehow successfully reconciles the heaviness with the melody and so the music literally soars on each track. and i love trevor horn's voice which imo is very unique - it is easily the most refreshing, pleasant yet rich vocals i've ever heard.    great great great album this! get this if you're above personality cults and like good music!
B0007TKNL0|2.0|I just finished reading several reviews of this movie and was very disappointed that so many of you enjoyed the singing so much! Andrew Lloyd Weber composed a gorgeous score with stunning lyrics to match! Ms. Emmy Rossum might have a pretty voice to sing a solo at a contemporary church service, but when casting Christine, one needs to look for a REAL singer! I much preferred the singing voice of Carlotta! (I know Minnie Driver was dubbed. She did an EXCELLENT job acting!) Her dub was a  legit singing voice! Rossum would not be heard without a microphone and the voice was whiny and shrill. I was hoping Carlotta would remain the lead in their opera! Before I continue with my negative comments, I will say I enjoyed Patrick Wilson! Another legit voice - a pop / musical theatre sound, but a pretty one! Thank you! The WORST element of this movie was Gerard Butler, the Phantom! In a musical, shouldn't the voice be the MOST important element!! He did not have one! He shouted his notes, he sang off pitch. It was ugly! The Phantom needs to be hideous on the outside but have a mysteriously beautiful voice that refletcts his inner goodness! His performance made me cringe! What a shame! Such a gorgeous story line, with a beautiful set, costumes and yes, the people were gorgeous!! But it was ruined by the casting! Two of the leads were not fit for their parts vocally! I await the day when people realize what a good sounding instrument is and hire someone for it!!... not just go out searching for a pretty face! There is much talent out there! You might just find the whole package!
B00011RPB0|5.0|The premise of `Lost in Translation' is simple.  Bob (Murray) is a middle-aged actor who is unhappy with his career and feels distanced from his family.  He travels abroad  - rather begrudgingly - to star in a Japanese whiskey commercial .  Charlotte (Johansson) is a young, attractive, and slightly elitist Yale graduate.  She is married to a busy photographer but doesn't seem to have much direction in her own life.  Eventually, Bob and Charlotte meet in the bar of a Tokyo hotel.  They connect immediately, which makes sense, because they have a lot in common.  Both - despite outwardly wonderful lives - are feeling lonely and isolated, and both have been doing some pretty heavy thinking ... about relationships, about their pasts, about their futures, and (however cliche it might sound) about the meaning of life.  One of the things I love about this film is that it handles the characters' contemplativeness very gently.  Take the scene where Charlotte is talking on the telephone to a friend (this is one of the most poignant moments in the film).  Earlier that day, she had stumbled upon a seemingly ancient religious ceremony, somewhere in the lush outskirts of the city.  But, as she admits to her friend, \\"I didn't feel anything.\\"  Although her comment is a bit vague and understated, we get the sense that Charlotte is frightened by her detachment and nihilistic leanings.      While Bob and Charlotte are not able to provide \\"answers\\" for one another, they are able to enjoy an emotional relationship.  The movie follows them as they spend time together exploring the hotel and the city - sometimes having outrageous fun (drinking to excess and singing karaoke) and sometimes just sitting quietly and talking.  Although this film is subtle and slow-moving and many will find it dull (just look at the reviews below - I mean, some people are down-right angry!), others - like me - will be absorbed.  The cinematography is stunning, and a lot of fabulous, dreamy music is used in the soundtrack (My Bloody Valentine complements the film's tone perfectly).  I also think that 'Lost in Translation' can be quite humorous, in its own, quiet way.  For instance, when Charlotte and her husband bump into a young actress in the hotel lobby, it is rather amusing to contrast Charlotte's calm, cool, and sharp personality with that of the ridiculously bubbly chatterbox.  I would also add that this film's final scene makes for one of the most perfect and simple endings I have ever come across (I am reminded of the PJ Harvey song \\"You Said Something\\").      In conclusion, if you can handle a slow-moving film, if you enjoy intelligent characters, and if you are attracted to stunning images, you may very well like this film.  If you prefer a lot of structure and dialogue, or if you are hoping for quintessential Murray, I'd skip it.
B00092ZL80|5.0|i have been a major fan of both bands for 30 years and have seen them in concert a few times. But seeing them together like this was something special and getting to see both bands play their timeless classics as 1 band was truly wonderful.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is the first Enigma album I have ever bought, although I have known there music for a long while, the songs 'Sadness' & 'Return to Innocence' have entrigued me for many years.  <br /> <br />Some of the songs on this album are just out of this world, so relaxing. This compilation brings a blend of modern percussion, ancient ambient beats & chants which together forms their benchmark original out of this world sound, the sound of Enigma.  <br /> <br />The most addictive tracks for me are - 'Age of Loneliness', 'I Love You, I'll Kill You', 'Morphing Through Time'.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This album is really great, i would actually give it a 4.5 if that was an option. However, when i first heard it, i wasnt blown away. I have noticed with this cd and room on fire, when i first heard them i wasn't in amazement, but after giving them a few more listens, I realized that they were both very good albums. This cd is a great edition to The Strokes' cd catalogue and would highly reccomend it to any Strokes fan wondering if they've still got it, just give it a few listens before passing judgement.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|It was the December before `Moulin Rouge' had hit theaters, and I was reading an article on Nicole Kidman in Vogue.  The journalist was talking about her upcoming film - a musical - , which was described as a cross between `Titanic' and `Rocky Horror Picture Show.'  It was also mentioned that the movie featured renditions of songs as unalike as \\"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"  What?!  I was instantly intrigued.            When I got around to seeing `Moulin Rouge' later the next year, it did not disappoint.  I tend to prefer movies that exercise my brain a bit, but this film is such a delight for the senses, that I can forgive its silly characters and trite plot (I'm actually rather grateful for the absence of a unique story - it would have been too distracting).  Another reviewer used the phrase \\"eye candy\\" to describe `Moulin Rouge' - and that is spot-on.  Director Baz Luhrman uses bright colors, exquisitely audacious costumes, electric lighting, whirling cameras and music-video-like editing to create a sort of \\"Modern\\" fairytale on acid.  In addition to having somewhat dizzying visual stimulation - `Moulin Rouge' is also an exercise for the ears.  A wide variety of popular music is reinterpreted throughout this film.  Listen closely or you may miss some of the songs (a snippet from David Bowie's \\"Diamond Dogs\\" escaped me at first).  The anachronistic musical choices, in any case, are quite fun.  On top of all this - `Moulin Rouge' can be rather humorous.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Satine, in a neglige, covers her head in a large fur blanket; aggressively throws herself on the floor; and shouts \\"Yes!\\" in response to Christian's \\"poetry reading.\\"  Very cute.            So, if a sappy little love-story wrapped up in a glittering whirl-wind of color, characters and noise sounds appealing to you, `Moulin Rouge' just might be the ticket.  If you're feeling nauseous just reading my review, I'd forget about this one.

B0006L16N8|3.0|Let's start with saying the truth and admit that Coldplay has finally and solidly made it to the mainstream. And very rarely will bands become mainstream by sticking to their essence... one example would be U2. The other quicker way is to become a copycat. And what a coincidence: guess who Coldplay is trying to copy? You're right: U2. Coldplay is trying very hard to sound like U2 in this album. It worked for them, as they've already sold millions of copies of X&Y. But musically, however, the Irish lads will always have the upper hand. In this album, Coldplay sounds monotonous and tired. Their previous release was much better, more authentic to say the least, and it also sold millions. This one just makes me yawn.... a great alternative to those sleeping pills.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Let me say this; I have been listening to this album ever since it's initial release. \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is simply an essential must-have in any musical collection. Tull was at their monumental peak on this composition,every musician in top form.Once more,this composition is truly engaging and sublime.The musical apex of brilliance. No matter what type of music that you prefer,go to add to cart NOW!!! Peace.

I'll give you an idea of tha phreaky bands I like, they include Lkimp Bizzkit, Linkin Park, KoRn, Slipknot, Mudvayne, Disturbed, Atreyu, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Staind, Mushroomhead, All American Rejects, Taking Back Sunday, Blink 182....da list goes on!!  Well someone mentioned that I might like this band Opeth so I gave this album a try and boy was it a big mistake!!  First of all, they play like a bunch of wussies, their's lots of slow mellow parts that will put you to sleep, and the songs go on wayyyy too long!!  I want a short fast peppy song that gets my blood going, but Opeth just puts me to sleep!  I give this disk too stars cuz I did find a use for it, I don't need to hit the snooze button on my alarm, I just put on this album, hahaha!!  For better musik, stick with bands from the Warped Toor, Ozzfest and TRL!!  Go Bengals, Carson Palmer and Chadwick Johnson are football's TRU M.V.P.'s!!
1400079179|5.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is no literary masterpiece, but it is a great read.  I have to give Dan Brown credit: he assembled all the pieces necessary to create a multimillion selling blockbuster.<br /><br />He starts with one of the great mysteries of the past 2000 years, the legend of the Holy Grail.  To this he adds one of the most passionate issues of all time: the origin and story of Jesus Christ, a subject over which wars have been fought and religious schisms created.  Dan Brown then posits some new, controversial theories on this topic, which have a certain appeal to elements of our ever more secular society.  To continue to appeal to his primarily secular audience, he brings in some historical scientific figures, especially Leonardo da Vinci, to highlight the conflict between science and religion over the centuries.  He then stirs in all the typical ingredients of a modern thriller: multiple murders, several conspiracies, chase scenes, corrupt and incompetent police, high tech toys, and a few mysterious, powerful figures.  Finally, to top it all off, Brown wraps the whole story into multiple Will Shortz-caliber puzzles.  It is an absolutely brilliant assemblage of pieces, assuming Brown's goal was to create a bestselling thriller, which it almost certainly was.<br /><br />I felt as though I had to read it, because it is the one non-Harry Potter book in the past few years that a good fraction of the American adult population has read.  It is a fairly quick read, and once I got a little more than halfway through, I did literally stay up into the wee hours in order to see how it ended. So yes, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />If you take it as a thriller, the book has few flaws.  The action starts immediately, and there is little character development, but supposedly the hero Robert Langdon has already been introduced in a preceding book, \\"Angels & Demons\\".  There are hints of attraction between Langdon and Sophie Neveu, but Brown doesn't explore this at any length (Langdon is definitely not James Bond in this respect).<br /><br />If you try to take \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" as more than a thriller, especially if you try to take its theories as truth, then you will encounter difficulties.  Brown includes many historical facts, and apparently accurate descriptions of places and objects, but a little searching on the Internet will surface the issues with some of the key elements of his theories, especially the Priory of Sion.  So, while Brown may not have succeeded in overthrowing 2000 years of Christianity, he has certainly produced a great thriller and made himself a lot of money in the process.is definitely not James Bond in this respect).

0307276902|5.0|I've never had the desire to use drugs in all of my 23 years.  When I read the back of the book I thought I wouldn't be interested in it at all.  I had seen Oprah talk about the book, and I decided to try it.  I am so glad I did.  Even if you don't do drugs or drink there are other addictions, and it is nice to have something to give a raw, very real account of overcoming an addiction.  I've never read a book that made me cry.  I like to think that I've read a good variety of literature, but I now think that any avid reader should add this to their collection.  It was written very well.  I almost couldn't put the book down.  I really recomend this with all my heart.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Gramm says, \\"It's the stupidest movie ever! You watch it, you die!\\" I aggree, your brain will disconect with your body if you do. I feel sorry for Metallica really, they suck and they don't even know it. What happend! Lars said the decided to drop the solos because it set them back to a certain period. Considering every song they ever recorded had a solo, I cant think of any era this sets them back to other than CRAP! I did't want to see dave mustaine cry, I didn't want to see james with cut hair I didn't want to watch it at all. Ten minutes in I wanted to kill myself for watching it.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|I have been a fan of Madonna's for over twenty years now and have stuck with her through thick and thin.  <br /> <br />While 2003's American Life was lambasted, I still enjoyed about 75% of the album, but still.. she was in dire need of a new direction. What critics adored about Ray Of Light, they found pretentious and boring in American Life. So Madonna did something a lot of longtime fans have been secretly wishing from her but figuring would never happen... she's gone back to her roots.  <br /> <br />I don't know how any fan of dance-pop can not worship this album. I have friends who haven't liked her since Erotica that are in love with this album. Granted, don't expect blockbuster status from this album, when the radio keeps shoving hip hop down your ears (it's great to hear a diva doing a dance album again, after the likes of J. Lo and Mariah have been overdoing the hip hop thing), this will likely only appeal to dance fans and Madonna-heads, but it's worth a check if you're one of either.  <br /> <br />This is one of Madonna's most irresistable records and if you're one of those fans from the 80's and early 90's who lost interest in Madonna because \\"she became pretentious and boring\\", you can rest easier because the pretention is gone and she is having more fun than she's had on any album since True Blue.  <br /> <br />This album will never replace the masterpiece that is Like A Prayer, but it's still perhaps the easiest Madonna album to get into in over a decade. She is back and she will always be the queen of pop!  <br /> <br />If you're a fan, you'll love \\"Fighting Spirit\\" <br /> <br />PS, what's the point of even trashing this album and then saying \\"if you want REAL music, go buy the new live Cream cd\\", there's nothing in common. If you were going to make a point about buying the latest from Barbra Streisand or Shakira or Cyndi Lauper instead of this, it would make a little more sense, because Madonna fans are more likely to like those instead.

1869505301|4.0|What a blast. We took the original edition on our tour two years ago and will be taking the extended edition this year. We also took a GPS with us and called our tour, \\"GPS to Mordor: there and back again,\\" and dutifully listed the references we achieved in our trip diaries. Through unseasonal sleet and floods and snow we had more fun than anyone deserves hunting the references and squinting at the photos. \\"It's this tree. No No. It's that one.\\" We went places we would never have dreamed of going otherwise, met fantastic people and saw astonishing country given a specific quality of discovery by finding the associations. Travels by quotation: \\"We're going to Rivendell to see the elves,\\" was a particular triumph. The additional trivia of filming and background simply added pleasure to the reading at night while checking the next day's itinerary. Without being a textbook, we certainly found it got us where we wanted to go as close as we needed to get there (except for the parts of NZ that were under water at the time). Think of it as an invitation to get out of the house and go find your own adventures.

B00005CDNJ|5.0|Abba is a group who never truly had a bad album, but they crossed all boundaries with their 1980 release Super Trouper. Toning down the disco-pop from Voulez-Vous and replacing it with a more sophisticated adult new wave pop beat. Abba saved themselves from the disco backlash (although their best disco song, LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME, is featured in this collection)with these set of songs. The Winner Takes It All was the first single released. A tear-jerking ballad about divorce, became Abba's fourth and final US top 10 single (yep, it seems like they had more...), the song is so highly emotional that anyone who has heard it must admit it's power. SuperTrouper is the first song and second US single, a pleasant record although not a great. Our Last Summer is an incredible ballad. Happy New Year is also beautiful. Me & I is an irresistably fun new wave record about cloning (or multiple personalities, however you look at it). The Piper is very Irish sounding and cute. Andante Andante is also a gorgeous soft song. This album is the definitive Abba album.
B00004RJ71|4.0|This film doesn't get the attention it should.  A very good look at the lives of 3 hispanic youths, two half brothers and their cousin as they grow up in a gang in California.  The film follows them into adulthood which leads them onto differant paths, but ones that intersect together to make a very realistic and violent tale.  At three hours the film may seem long, but the story it tells needs the time and it doesn't drag at all.  If you are a fan of prison films, the second half of the story takes place in great part in a prison.  A close cousin to the film American Me, I believe this film to be much superior.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|If `XXX: State of the Union' is painfully bad, that is not because it has no coherent plot. Anyway you don't need it when you get good actions, interesting characters (hopefully with one-lines), and good supporting actors. The original `XXX' had all of them - extreme sports type actions with the hair-raising climax, super-macho Vin Diesel as likable hero Xander Cage, and beautiful and sexy Asia Argent. <br /> <br />So why did they make a sequel without them? No Diesel? No Asia? This must be a joke, and it turns out that way. Sam Jackson is back, yes, I admit, but his recent track record is not what it was when he was in `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown.' And the director is Lee Tanahori (no!) whose very inept direction in the latest 007 film is still a bad memory to me. <br /> <br />Probably you would think that you can write a better story after watching `XXX: State of the Union,' and probably you are right. Ice Cube is newly recruited from the prison by Samuel L. Jackson's Agent Gibbons, and Cube almost single-handedly prevents the sneering bad guy Willem Defoe from doing some terrible (but hardly credible) things in the most contrived way. When I say `single-handedly,' I do not exaggerate. Ice Cube jumps in the air from the wall, shoot rocket launchers, and chase the bullet train. Sometimes you can see him with sidekick Scott Speedman, and two `XXX' girls Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey, but basically Cube is the center of the film. Well, he is not bad. <br /> <br />What is really bad about the film is the over-the-top actions which overuse the special effects. As in `Die Another Day,' in which Tamahori did the same mistake, his excessive action set-pieces are always so big and loud that they often make it too obvious that the post-production work polished up the shots with fast-cut editing and CGIs. It is watching the screen of video games, where many explosions and car chases happen, but ultimately they are all tedious. <br /> <br />About eleven years ago, Tamahoriimpressed the world with his superb `Once Were Warriors.' Now he is doing `Along Came a Spider' `Die Another Day' and this one. But I'm not surprised seeing his recent career for this is a familiar story we all heard in Hollywood. And I'm not surprised either if someone is trying to make another `XXX' film. Next time, Rob Cohen please.
B0007XT87G|4.0|I wouldn't have found these guys if not for Amazon's marketing.  I listen to a wide variety of stuff, but lately have been listening to more progressive and metal such as Dream Theater, Tool, and King Crimson.  Found these guys on Amazon and decided to try the latest CD, Deadwing.  Really, really good stuff on it.  These guys are musically tight and great song 'crafters'.  I quickly purchased In Absentia to compare to.  This seems to be a little more metal-influenced than that (also good) CD.  The title track and Arriving Somewhere... are two of my favorites.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|ok, so what about his personal life?  That's for another review.     <br /> <br />Thriller is an album that everyone in the 1980's seemingly had a copy of, and it's been a respectable catalog seller (usually selling 200,000-300,000 copies a year, not bad for a 1982 release and with so many collections on the market), why?  because it's that good.   Everything that could go right, went right for Thriller. <br /> <br />He broke down barriers with the videos (even though frankly, MTV's deteriorated so badly into reality hell I'd take 1982 MTV loaded with nothing but rock videos over 2006 MTV loaded with bad reality shows and maybe three videos a day anyday of the week, all of which are from crappy artists personally) and truly became the Beatles/Elvis of the era. <br /> <br />How does the music hold up?  it's still great.   Billie Jean has not lost one ounce of its magic over 23 years, same goes for P.Y.T. and Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.    <br /> <br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' (5/5) - an epic dance track, one of the most fun MJ party tracks ever <br />2. Baby Be Mine (5/5) - regarded by some as filler, I disagree, this is a fun sensual r&b midtempo track <br />3. The Girl Is Mine (2/5) - it's okay I guess, but miles behind \\"Say Say Say\\", the other MJ/Paul McCartney collaboration <br />4. Thriller (5/5) - still a fun funky recording <br />5. Beat It (3.5/5) - somewhat overrated and dated, but I love the Eddie Van Halen solo <br />6. Billie Jean (5/5) - even though MJ's had well over forty hit singles as a solo artist and with the Jackson Five, this will wind up being the song that in 100 years, people will still associate as his masterpiece.   A frequent appearer in \\"best pop songs of all time\\" lists <br />7. Human Nature (5/5) - somewhat dated but I've always loved this ballad <br />8. P.Y.T. (5/5) - another great funky dance track, while it went top 10, it's probably the most forgotten track off the album <br />9. The Lady In My Life (4.5/5) - a great and sexyballad. <br /> <br />This album will continue to sell and live on long after MJ is dead and buried, this album is a great time capsule of an era that a lot of people truly miss.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|This version may be more faithful to Roald Dahl's classic tale, but there wasn't as much life in those everlasting gob stoppers as I would have imagined.  Depp deftly captures Willie Wonka and Burton creates a vivid set of images of the novella, but the movie looked too much like a picture book and failed to create the tension and thrill of the story the way the original version with Gene Wilder did. This movie is amazingly somber and dull, with the characters walking gingerly over the sets, afraid it seems to touch the world Burton has created.  He turns each scene carefully over, like one would do in a pop-out children's book.  The kids are faithful restorations of those in the novel, when Burton could have updated them and given them far more spunk.  Anyway, the film is a visual treat with some fun side stories like Wonka's discovery of the Oompa Loompas.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|When it came out, I declined to see The Last Samurai on the big screen. At the time I felt I had just had enough of Tom Cruise to last a while, and couldn't stand the thought of him damaging another movie with as much potential as this one seemed to have. I was finally coerced into watching the DVD and now I regret not going to the theatre. I must say ol' Tom actually surprised me. And of course the other characters, especially Watanabe's Katsumoto and Koyuki's Taka, were downright special. I'd spend the rest of my days in that tiny village if I could. I loved the story, I just wish it had been written as a novel before it became a movie. <br /> <br />But this review is about Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. I'm only writing this now, at 4:00 am, because I have insomnia, and it occurred to me as I tossed and turned with \\"A Small Measure of Peace\\" emanating from my CD player, that it's quietly become one of my favorites; so quietly I've never put a review up on Amazon. So here I sit, tired and yawning, yet wide awake. It's actually pretty ironic. I have had a 2-year love affair with it that I don't see coming to an end anytime soon. This soundtrack somehow evokes an ominous duality of emotions, each incredibly powerful yet delicately subtle. I could only describe them as raging placidity, melancholic sanguinity, and turbulent tranquility. It contains some of the most spiritually haunting music I've ever heard. The reflective theme introduced in \\"A Way of Life\\" and revisited in \\"Idyll's End\\" and elsewhere is utterly breathtaking. I love how Zimmer employs instruments with cultural significance. The soundtrack is not without battle sequences. \\"Spectres in the Fog\\" and \\"Ronin\\" are morbidly stimulating. I somehow relate to this music on countless levels, perhaps because of its context within the movie, yet it goes beyond that. <br /> <br />Music is all about mood. Some people try to set their moods to match their music of choice. I honestly don't know if that's possible, because for me, it's always been the other way around. I must choose music that reflects my own mood, and this soundtrack matches my outlook most of the time. It's a great reflection of life. I don't see Last Samurai as purely about tragedy and sorrow. Yes it has those elements, but it's also about love and hope and strength and integrity. Listen to the voice in \\"The End of the Beginning\\". Try to sense her anguish, her sorrow, and then feel the passion and hope beneath that pain. Perhaps I'm just at a time and place in my life where I \\"get it\\". <br /> <br />I love this soundtrack! If you don't have it you should definitely give it a listen.
0064471047|5.0|<br />       Here are two meanings I got out of the first book.  The first meaning i saw was an awesome and well detailed magical story.  I saw this to be fun to read.  A great story, and that I had something to look forward to, because it is a series.  Then I found a out the movie was coming out.  My brother mentioned something to me about the meaning behind the book.  This is to share Jesus Christ, and show what he did in many different ways.  Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus Christ as some might know.  Then other people are supposed to represent different things.  It shows Aslan dying for the sins the prince made, then raising from the dead.  Sound familiar to someone?  There were also tons more metaphors relating to christianity.  Like the evil witch representing the devil in some parts.  First of all, the which is always taunting the lion(Jesus Christ).  Also the queen tempting the prince into things like turkish delite, over the love for eachother.  Those are just some of the ways i believe the book relates.  There are many other things you can get out of the book.  If you didn't know some of this, then don't hold back from reading your child the book, because of some of the relations.    It is another great title from C.S. Lewis.  I hope you enjoy.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|we live in a world where Who's That Girl doesn't get much love.  The movie made less than $10 million at the box office, the songs from the soundtrack were ignored from The Immaculate Collection, and we have suffered seeing movies like A Certain Sacrifice and Shanghai Surprise getting the DVD treatment first, but rest assured, our prayers have finally been answered. <br /> <br />Who's That Girl was released in the summer of 1987, starring the queen of pop, Madonna, as a streetwise con artist who was just released from prison for a crime she didn't commit.   Griffin Dunne (After Hours, An American Werewolf In London) played Louden Trott, a soon-to-be-married lawyer who was given simple instructions by his almost-father in law to pick her up from jail and take her to the bus station...  neither Louden nor Nikki's lives will ever be the same again.  Complete with a zany variety of characters as well as a cougar (or known as a \\"Patagolian Felix\\"), the film is a true screwball comedy and updates the classic \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" into the 1980's <br /> <br />The movie was critically maligned from the moment it came out, but among Madonna fans, it was an instant cult classic.   Madonna was extremely charismatic and funny in this film, even if the story is predictable.   I have always had a soft spot in my heart for this film with Madonna.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Korn 1993-2005 R.I.P.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I honestly do not like groups or bands, who tend to go onward when a key member of the band leaves the group, and the remaining band members tend to continue. This is due to the fact that the sound tends to change and it tends to hurt the group all the way around. But not this time. Due to the fact that \\"Head\\" left the group for spiritual reasons, KoRn had to step it up a notch for their new album \\"See You on The Other Side\\". And, if you like the first two albums from this amazing group, then you will dig this album. With songs like \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and songs like \\"Hypocrite\\" or \\"Politics\\", the albums has a stronger approach to the mainstream, water-down rock that has plaqued the airwaves the past two years. Along with this album, they tended to experiment with more of synthesizers on songs like \\"Tearjerker\\" or \\"Throw Me Away\\". Plus, Johnathan Davis returns to his roots with playing the bagpipes on certain tracks on the album, something that he has not done since his earlier projects. However, the downfall of this being a complete album is the fact that there is the void of not having Head in the lineup. Even though that Head is missing, they do push harder to make their own sound all their own. Plus, with the experimentations with synthesizers and a little techno into the mix, the album starts off hard, like the way they usually do, but then, slopes downward to a little bit softer. Overall, KoRn's \\"See You on The Other Side\\" is a great album to own for the die-hard KoRn fanatic. This is just what they need for a fresh start in the industry where it has become watered-down.
B00000J048|4.0|We've enjoyed this toy, but it hasn't held their attention as long as I would have liked.  My 4 year old is interested, but it is over quickly.  I gave this a high rating because I think he will really love it in the near future when he can get more into the sophistication of the toy.   <br /> <br />My main issue is that the white pegs that hold the gears to the blocks bend and break easily.  Georello sends many extras with the pack, so it's not too much of an issue yet.  I would say a definite yes for kids around the ages of 5-6, especially builders!
0064471837|5.0|I bought this book from a person who said it was the best fantasy book - you know, that one book that all fantasy lovers must read - and I agree.  I have just finished reading Sabriel. It is well written, once you start reading you cannot put it down, and the words flow together with amazing imagery.  The plot is amazing.  I cannot say enough good things about this book.
0571202284|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. I cant believe the amount of knowledge between each chapter. And when you begin to put these simple techniques into practice you open up a whole new world. You can breathe life into old cycles and ideas that you thought were good before too. The only crit I have here is that even though these skills can transfer to 3d, there is no real technical advice. Otherwise this should belong on every animator's book shelf!
0553801503|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Martin's first three offerings in this series and was looking forward to the newest one. Like many other readers, I thought this would be the one that brought everything together. No such luck. Not only has he chosen to range even farther afield, but in this one he totally neglected most of the main characters that we were hoping to see and introduced a bunch that most discerning readers could care less about. The key to writing good fantasy is action - which, sad to say, this overblown tome sorely lacks.  <br /> <br />Martin seems to have caught the same disease that plagues others in the field, like Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind, just to name two. It may be as simple as greed. These writers get a good series going, and when people rush out to buy their books they decide to keep milking the saga for all it's worth - at the expense of good writing. To me that is an insult to the readers who stuck with them. <br /> <br />It makes me sad to see reviews in which George R. R. Martin (and by the way, what a pretentious pseudonym) is actually compared favorably to the old master, J. R. R. Tollkein. Tollkein was a wonderful author who wrote a gripping saga that kept readers involved from beginning to end, and did it in only three books - four, if you count 'The Hobbit'. He wrota a tale that had a beginning, a middle and best of all, an END! Martin is sadly lacking in providing the latter.  <br /> <br />This book was an intellectual and financial cheat, and I won't be buying the next one. (Or the one after that, or the one after that...)  <br /> <br />
B0002V7OI8|5.0|One of the greatest disaster movies of all time - on par with \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Dante's Peak\\" - \\"Deep Impact\\" centers on the real-life possibility of a comet on a collision course with Earth, something that's happened before in the distant past and could happen again in the future.  What's highly important about the premise is that, this time around, it's handled realistically - from the public reaction to the desperate attempts to find some way, any way, to stave off the inevitable, to the government's attempts to conceal their knowledge of the looming collision behind a wall of secrecy.  Even more impressive is that the filmmakers have pulled all this off simultaneously with a movie that views humanity and its behavior in its darkest hour in a surprisingly optimistic light, even including the 'secretive governments', who usually come off very badly in this sort of movie scenario.  Whether or not things would play out this way in terms of people's actions is impossible to say, but it's a refreshing path for the movie to take compared to the usual all-out chaos erupting.  Interstingly, many of the brightest and most hopeful parts of \\"Deep Impact\\" are what have turned many off the movie: the acts of genuine altruism in the most terrifying circumstances, the reunion of estranged loved ones during the final days before the comet's impending arrival, etc.       A last-ditch effort is indeed made to divert the comet using a space shuttle frantically armed during the last few months before the news of the collision course went public, an astronaut crew of crack experts and spaceflight veterans and an unproven, untested plan that's all anybody could come up with in what, relative to the complexity of the task, is extremely short notice.  Whether the exact mechanics of the plan and certain effects would be technically feasible is, I suppose, debateable, but it comes off as far more plausible than some other movies of this nature; accurate 95% of the time and when it arguably misses, it's in the details, not in a huge gaping hole in logic.       Visually awesome and dramatically moving, with great performances from Morgan Freeman, Tea Leoni, Robert Duvall, and, really, the whole ensemble cast.  Cerebral, thrilling and usually highly believable; a credit to the disaster genre.
038533348X|5.0|Dr. Asa Breed, scientist from the  research laboratory of the General Forge and Foundation Company, had this statement to say about Dr. Felix Hoenicker, one of the founding fathers of the atomic bomb as well as the creator of \\"Ice Nine:\\"<br /><br />\\"I told you all this in order to give you some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Felix was likely to approach an old problem.\\"<br /><br />The statement could easily become non-fiction if the word \\"Felix\\" was replaced with \\"Kurt Vonnegut.\\"  Vonnegut is a master of spinning a crazy web of seemingly random events that poignantly, clearly spell out a very clear and crystallized point.<br /><br />Vonnegut is a crafty-sneaky writer. Two skills, which many writers have individually, but few have in tandem, set him apart from other writers. First, he has the ability to present his story as an unrelated series of random events. The \\"hero\\" seems to be victim of merciless random forces that confront him with strange events and experiences. However, the story remains tight and coherent and Vonnegut's points are amazingly clear.<br /><br />Second, in the true science fiction tradition, Vonnegut makes bizarre, incredible and completely fictitious creations seems completely plausible. Taken together, he seems to repetitively beat the reader over the head with rather salient life observations hidden behind bizarrely incredulous premises. With the exception of \\"Slaughter-House Five,\\" Cat's Cradle may be Vonnegut's best demonstration of these two most characteristic skills.<br /><br />He starts the story with the narrator giving a brief explanation as to why is called Jonah (which he is never referred to as for the remainder of the story):<br /><br />\\"...somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times, without fail. Conveyances and motives, both conventional and bizarre, have been provided. And according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.\\"<br /><br />Similar to other Vonnegut Heroes (Billy Pilgrim, Rabo Karabekian are two), Jonah passively and seemingly haphazardly drifts among nonsensical events. For Jonah, the terminal destination is President of the island republic of San Lorenzo. During his journey, he meets a motley cast of characters seemingly unrelated. For sneaky Vonnegut, they are related, many of even them belong to his own karass.<br /><br />Secondly, Vonnegut is the master science fiction writer. Two science fictional concepts that Vonnegut creates in Cat's Cradle are the scientific invention of \\"Ice Nine\\" and the religion of \\"Bokononism.\\" Both Bokononism and Ice Nine are the centerpieces of the novel, so they had to suspend the reader's disbelief, or the story would die. With Ice Nine, Vonnegut needed to create a scientific discovery that was capable of destroying the earth. He did it, and explained in a simple and believable manner. Very clever. The religion of Bokononism includes its own philosophy, last rites and vocabulary (karass, granfalloons, pool-pah, foma, wampeter, etc). Similarly, he defines religion as \\"better and better lies\\" intended as an \\"instrument of hope.\\" On San Lorenzo, everyone is a Bokononist, and Jonah becomes one over the course of the story. Most of the Bokonon philosophy is presented as short statements, often only in short, Confucius-like statements and often provided to a calypso beat. My favorite Bokonon saying is: \\"Maturity is the bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy something.\\"<br /><br />The story provides some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Vonnegut is likely to approach an old problem. Cat's Cradle asks the tough question of what is morality in an existential world. The ultimate answer, unfortunately, is self-destruction.lgrim, Rabo Karabekian are two), Jonah passively and seemingly haphazardly drifts among nonsensical events.

B00005KARK|5.0|The very definition of the term 'Disney Classic', \\"Dumbo\\" is a magical fable of a movie as perfect for a 23 year-old or 93 year-old as it is for a three year-old.  Hilarious, tender and exhilirating, this tale of a young elephant made an outcast because of the enormous size of his ears - and the legendary turn of events that puts Dumbo's persecutors firmly in their place - is one of the greatest Disneys, with superb classic animation and great, offbeat music.  The scenes of Dumbo's gentle mother trying to soothe her befuddled offspring and shelter him from the world's mocking, ostracizing ways are a wonderfully moving touch, and the ending is glorious.  If you're in the market for an awesome 'all-ages' movie, there are very few that match \\"Dumbo\\".

B000BOH8XW|5.0|I first heard this album on October 30th 2005 while waiting to see Shakira perform in London. This combined with my excitment of finally seeing my favourite artist live doesn't put me in the best posistion to form an opinion on the album (I love it by the way). What I am going to put down are some facts: <br /> <br />When Shakira was creating this album she concentrated on the details, and it shows. Each song has layers that can't be picked out after only one spin. <br /> <br />The songs that don't jump out at you will slowely invade your consciousness. In other words this album is one that grows on everyone. <br /> <br />There are Shakira trademarks all over this album, especially in Animal City, Hey You (Specifcally the horns in this one), and Your Embrace (my favourite ballad). <br /> <br />The best fast/rock tracks on this album are Don't Bother, Animal City, and Costume makes the Clown.  <br /> <br />The best of the slow are Your Embrace, and Something. <br /> <br />And the best of the upbeat are Hey You, and Timor (the beat makes an interesting contrast with the lyrics on this last track). <br /> <br />Finally if you have no preconceived notions buy this album and listen to it about five times. You'll find at least a couple of songs that suit you, and you'll come to love the rest.
0142000663|2.0|The Grapes of Wrath is supposedly an American classic.  The fact that it is considered such explains many of my problems with American literature and American culture in general.  In order to show what a poor contender this novel is, I'm going to contrast it to something that's actually great literature, Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky.<br /><br />Where to begin?  First and most importantly, the narrative is uninspiring.  The prose is dry, dispassionate and bland.  Not dessicated and spare and powerful like Camus, but just dull.  The interchapters, in particular, are tedious and pretensious exercises in literary superfluity.  All of your middle-school english teachers no doubt told you that when you write something you should 'show not tell,' and that's good advice, but Steinbeck just tells you the story and keeps telling it for 600 miserable pages.  So thus the manner of the novel's writing adds nothing to the book, and indeed detracts from it.  Contrast this to a novel by Dostoevsky like Crime and Punishment or Notes from Underfround where the narrative itself is feverish, illucid and grating, reflecting the protagonist's wretchedness.<br /><br />Next, all the characters are delightfully black and white, on the whole.  Casey is messianic, the men killing him are devils, and there's no in between.  Contrast this to the moral ambiguities of Crime and Punishment and you'll see why Steinbeck comes off the worse.<br /><br />On a related note, the novel seems to have no means of conveying a spiritual message of its own, since the prose is so soulless, but Steinbeck tries to make it spiritual by inserting Casey's tedious neotranscendentalist sermonizing.  Contrast this to Crime and Punishment, where the moral is so integral to novel that any expounding of it is entirely natural.<br /><br />So if you enjoy complex, multilayered characters, an interesting writing style and stimulating philosophical questions in a novel, stop yourself before you pick up this inexplicably 'classic' novel and read something by a Russian instead.plicably 'classic' novel and read something by a Russian instead.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews for Gilmore Girls: Season 5 and I have noticed some very akward reviews. Such as I noticed a few that complained about packaging. There was ever a couple that were simply rude and un-neccisairy. Well I'm out to give all of you fans of the show a real review. <br /> <br />The fifth season deals alot with the Lorelai-Luke relationship and Rory begining her journey to adulthood.  <br /> <br />Many fans have been waiting for the Lorelai-Luke relationship to begin. Now that it has I feel that it has completed the show! <br />It made many people happy, but to some it was wrong,wrong,wrong. <br />In this season Emily (who was finally getting along with Lorelai in the 4th season) tries (and almost succeeds) to ruin the Lorelai-Luke relationship. But instead ends up breaking the Lorelai-Emily relationship. Such as the wedding episode where Christopher gets in a verbal fight with Luke and tells Lorelai that Emily said he still had a chance. <br /> <br />This season brings great change for Rory as she trys to find out who she is. This big change starts at the end of the 4th season when Rory sleeps with her married ex-Dean. Which creates a huge gap between her and Lorelai. Then Rory meets Logan, a rich frat boy (the kind of boy we thought she would never fall for). Which also dousn't help Lorelai. At the end of the season Rory and Logan steal a boat and get put in jail. Rory then drops out of Yale. But at the very end is the biggest slap of all for Lorelai when her parents tell her Rory will be moving into their poolhouse. <br /> <br />The 4th Season was a bit of a drag. But the 5th season brought it all back! This is one of my favorites seasons! If i could i would give it 5 million stars! So OY WITH THE POODLES ALREADY! <br />Get off your butt and buy it now!
B00003CXC6|5.0|This movie was beautifully put together. The black and white with slight yellow colorwashing was a good look for the story and added to the heat. <br /> <br />The basic storyline is that a murder was committed in the woods and the only few people that have a clue as to what happened tell conflicting stories. The underlying storyline is that everyone involved lies or bends the truth when they're telling their stories to the officials. Every one of the people, even the dead man's tale through the medium, try to make themselves look better rather than tell the truth and have the situation resolved. <br /> <br />Very beautiful music and coloring and storytelling methods. Kurosawa did a wonderful job on this movie and it was very enjoyable.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I have been an Enya fan for a few years, I love new age music for its soothing, tranquil and non aggressive atmosphere when I want to sit back and chill out. <br /> <br />This CD should please every and any Enya fan, as it is purely to the core ENYA. <br />Her voice ranges from a delicate coil of a breathed whisper to warm and soothing tones that sound like a liquid jewel. I think that I can listen to this album on repeat for a few hours. Each song is different yet magically beautiful. <br /> <br />My favorites are; <br />Amarantine; rich and light at the same time, very Enya in nature. Sounds like a Minuet and has a wonderful and very catchy chorus. It sounds ancient yet so light. <br /> <br />Drifting ; mostly music and no singing, but the most beautiful cello and piano I have ever heard. It sounds like a dance in slow motion in the middle of winter, simply amazing; it almost brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. The throbbing sound of cello is deep and slow, I am listening to it as I type this; it sounds like a love ballad; haunted and rich. <br /> <br />It's in the Rain; wonderful song, I literally feel like the rain she sings about washes over my face. It's soothing, wonderful and almost sad. <br /> <br />I love all the songs, and I can't say enough about it, it's an easy choice when you want something great to listen to. Lovely!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, I want to say that I've been told that I'm a difficult person to please, and that I'm particularly not too fond of westerns. But in the same breathe I must say that I love this series, I love this series, I love this series. It is for this reason I felt compelled to write this, my first review. Like many others I also missed it when it originally aired but was introduced to it recently by a friend. I watched his Firefly box set, then saw Serenity at another friend's house, and then ordered both yesterday. Buying both the series and the movie is my way of saying to Universal \\"please make a sequel.\\" I'm sure many others feel the same. If you've never seen this show before bear past the first few episodes. It doesn't really hit it's stride until the middle of disc 2. The last disc is especially great. If you're looking for aliens, space battles, and computer generated eye candy this series is not for you. Firefly is about great story telling and the intriguing characters in it, qualities seldom seen on TV today. I hope to see Serenity fly again in the future. <br /> <br />One last thought: Book. Previous life. Operative?
B000002O1Q|3.0|This CD is the aural equivalent of eating a tube of chocolate chip cookie dough.  You enjoy doing it, and you're ashamed of yourself for doing it at the exact same time.   <br /> <br />The sound of the album is very inconsistent: it's got a couple of Meatloaf-esque \\"Rock Opera\\" pieces (Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young, Nowhere Fast) Stevie Nix-esque pieces (sorcerer, Never Be You), Rockabilly-esque (Hold That Snake, One Bad Stud, Blue Shadow), 80's pop (Deeper and Deeper), and R & B Lite (I Can Dream About You, Countdown To Love.)  So when I'm in the mood for one or two of the genres on here, I'm by default not in the mood for the others. <br /> <br />Nowhere Fast is probably the worst offender of the guilty pleasure part.  The lyrics are SO bad (Google them, if you like) that you feel dumb for singing along while you're singing along.  Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young is a VERY close second: you listen to the words and think to yourself, \\"Yeah, that's right!  Oh, wait.  Nope, that's not it at all.\\"  If you are looking for more music because you've worn out your Bat Out Of Hell 8-Track, these two songs will be a blessing from Rock Heaven for you. <br /> <br />The rest of them are serviceable, with one outstanding exception: I Can Dream About You is a good song that made it to hit status way back in the dark ages of the mid-80s.  I got to see the movie and buy the album the first time when I was 15, and the whole movie and CD experience appeals to the 15 year old part of everyone I know who likes it. <br /> <br />The songs work a lot better in the context of the movie than they do separated from it.  Usually, after I've seen a movie I can appreciate the soundtrack on its own better.  Not so here: the songs work a LOT better with the visuals than by themselves.  Get the DVD and watch the songs instead.
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan was the voice of America during the 60's. He is probably the most prolific writer of his generation if not ever. <br />The Essential Bob Dylan is an outstanding collection of songs, from his entire career <br />There are a few songs missing such as Girl From the North Country and a few others. <br />This collection is for those who want his hits or who are now listening to Dylan for the first time. <br />If you really enjoy what year hear let me suggest The Freewheelin Bob Dylan to go along with this. <br />As you will see there are many songs that were covered by other artists like the Byrds, Sonny and Cher, Peter, Paul & Mary and countless others.................
B000002UAX|4.0|Some random thoughts about an album that seems put together at random: <br /> <br />1) It's a great children's album. Rocky Raccoon, Blackbird, Bungalow Bill, the one about Paul's dog, the one about the slide. And really, \\"doing it in the road\\" could mean just about anything, right?  My 4-year-old loves this record. <br /> <br />2)  John is at his best here.  Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, and Julia are among his best songs. If they had included \\"Across the Universe\\" in this collection as they should have, we could have gotten a whole disk of John's songs, followed by another disk of Paul and George. That would have been a gutsy move, and more satisfying to me than the way it was done. <br /> <br />3)  Honey Pie? Wild Honey Pie?  C'mon Paul, finish your work! <br /> <br />4) This should have been made as a single LP and it should have contained the following 17 tracks (not necessarily in order): <br /> <br />Back in the U.S.S.R. <br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps <br />Happiness Is A Warm Gun <br />I'm So Tired <br />Blackbird <br />Julia <br />Mother Nature's Son <br />Across the Universe (from Anthology) <br />Revolution One (or even better, the single) <br />Dear Prudence <br />Martha My Dear <br />Rocky Raccoon <br />Why Don't We Do It In The Road <br />I Will <br />Yer Blues <br />Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey <br />Helter Skelter <br /> <br /> <br />That might have been the greatest Beatles' album ever. <br />

Tom Petty does Rainy Day Women #12&35 <br />Roger McGuinn sings his fameous version of Mr Tambourine Man which sounds just like the Byrds. <br />Everyone comes out for an encore and does My Back Pages and Dylan ends the concert with It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding and Girl From The North Country. <br />This album not only has an all-star cast but it is fun to see all the great musicians working together and having such a good time. <br />This is a must for any Dylan fan.................
B00005QVHI|1.0|first off this album lacks imagintation its unbelivable admittedly they have a good guitarist in the form of tom mellero but otherwise they are a load of crap this is the worst cd in my collection and i have never brought another ratm record since if you want to hear political rock i sugest system of a down this the worst cd in my collection now there are some who may like this if you like rap you may do but the rap element isnt perticullary good quality even by the standard it has been set so unless your a fan of rap-rock (crap rock) then buy this  now i only borrowed this album from someone who said it was brilliant it is probably worth borrowing if you like catchy guitar riffs ruined by some crap rapper
B000BFH2S2|1.0|Michael Buble is going down hill fast.  Each CD is a repeat of the same TRITE material and in a word \\"BORING\\".  He needs to learn some new standards.  I was once excited about his talent, now I am blase`.  Oh you say the DVD makes it worth it.  I saw the program on PBS so the DVD was a repeat.  His first CD was also with a DVD.  The CD is a re-hash of the same tired songs he has done since his first CD.  Totally Buble was a god send compared to the stuff he has since put out.  NOT IMPRESSED, maybe he should go back to scaling fish in Canada. GET SOME NEW MATERIAL!  If by chance you to are tired of Michael, Try Tony DeSare He has a wonderful voice, can play piano, and writes his on material some of which will become standards.
B00005JO17|5.0|For the pure fact that I have been unmotivated to catch any kids movie recently Chicken little was a surpriseingly bright star!  It is refreshing too to a movie now that BOTH my son and daughter like.  Especially one that isnt overly girly..In a world bombarded by princesses, fairies and super heros,it is nice to have an everyday hero, even if he is a chicken.<br /><br />I went in with low hopes, not really thinking I would like it based on previews.  I left giddy and excited to catch kids movies again.  they created a great set of charaters.  The story was entertaining throughout the whole movie.  and in the End, there really isnt a bad guy :).
B0009NZ3BO|4.0|Forced to squeeze out a new album in less than four weeks and after constant touring (Ray Shulman joked that the album \\"would be finished after it was released\\") \\"Interview\\" made Gentle Giant fans happy but didn't break any new ground with the public. It's still a marvelous album even if it is a bit uneven the best tracks including the amazing \\"Timing\\". The manufacturing problem aside (initially the mono masters were sent to the manufacturing plant), this is a terrific album. The title track has wit to spare as it focuses on the music press and their vapid obsession with the next big thing. The press never did display (with few exceptions)any understanding of the band's music. The spare beauty of \\"Empty City\\" and even \\"I Lost My Head\\" are among the other highlights on this disc.<br /><br />Kudos to whomever mastered this as \\"Interview\\" has never sounded this crisp, vivid and powerful before. Although I would have liked to have more bonus tracks on this disc and comments from Derek, Phil Gary, Kerry and John about the making of the album, I'm happy that it's available in this edition. The original artwork (including lyrics) have been adapted for the CD format and it's an improvement over the BGO release of nearly a decade ago (which was coupled with \\"Free Hand\\").<br /><br />It's also the last album before the Giant took the plunge off the cliff of top 40 prog pop. The songs became less complex over the succeeding three albums and the albums themselves became less interesting. It's clear that for GG to take a step back to commercial music making like when the Shulman brothers were in Simon Dupree and The Big Sound just wasn't going to happen.<br /><br />\\"The Missing Piece\\" (despite some noteworthy tracks), \\"Giant for a Day\\" (often cited as the band's worst album) and the underrated \\"Civilian\\" all saw a decline in the quality of the songwriting. It's clear that GG were desperately clinging to the lifeboat of traditional rock 'n' roll. While these three albums couldn't possibly measure up to anything GG had done before, they all have moments that recall the power and the glory of this marvelous band.three albums couldn't possibly measure up to anything GG had done before, they all have moments that recall the power and the glory of this marvelous band.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is the BEST Who album ever!!! And probably one of the greatest rock albums of all time!!!!  They just don't make them like this anymore.  This one shows off their writing, producing, and playing and singing talents.  Baba O' Riley is a great start to this wonderful CD.  The Song Is Over and Behind Blue Eyes are two of my absolute favorite songs by The Who. Going Mobile is another great tune.  It was good to hear  I Don't Even Know Myself...it was the B-side of an old 45 rpm record that I had many years ago of Won't Get Fooled Again.  Buy this CD you won't be sorry and you'll wonder what happened to these guys after this release and Quadrophenia!  Their really isn't a bad song on this one!!!!
B000BJS4F8|4.0|THE COLLECTION (not \\"the greatest hits\\")...     i would just like to say that the the DVD (yes this is the SPECIAL EDITION CD & DVD you are looking at) is well worth the money because it includes a good/user friendly documentary of alanis, charting her success from JLP to her recent album S-CC. she really comes out on top with this one. she comes across as a genuinely nice person.... very rare amongst celebrities these days.     i will always regard alanis morissette as one of the rare singer/songwriters who can create/produce/throw together a range of songs that cut to the chase.     during this present climate where people like the the black eyed peas are revered, Alanis is a welcome breath of fresh air (sadly not a breath of insecticide which would exterminate various no talent personalities like the forementioned... ugggh hugggh cough cough!!! did i just splutter the words \\"paris hilton\\" in that chest based removal of phlegm?).    sorry back to Alanis.... (got a little side tracked back there). People need to realise that this is an album which she has chose to entitle \\"THE COLLECTION\\" at no point did she choose to name this album \\"ALANIS MORISSETTE - THE GREATEST HITS\\"    ifhe had she HAD chosen to compose a GREATIST HITS album (which she didn't, I would have kind of hoped that she would have opted for the following tracks......)    1)  ALL I REALLY WANT  2)  YOU OUGHTA KNOW  3)  HAND IN MY POCKET  4)  YOU LEARN  5)  HEAD OVER FEET  6)  IRONIC   7)  NO PRESSURE OF CAPPUCCINO  8)  UNINVITED  9)  BABA  10) THANK U  11) UNSENT  12) SO PURE  13) THESE R THE THOUGHTS  14) STILL  15) 21 THINGS I WANT IN A LOVER  16) HAND CLEAN  17) PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS  18) 8 EASY STEPS  19) EVERYTHING  20) CRAZY
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece, and shows the high quality talent of sir Jim Henson. watching it from a child till now, the movie ceases to amaze me. the sound track to the puppetry is incredible. Its a must see! <br />
B000002UR7|4.0|As a recent fan of Radiohead, I have plenty more to hear, but I do love this album.  I was surprised to hear how old it is (What was I listening to back in '93?) but there are two songs in particular that I'd be sad to have missed out on: Creep and Stop Whispering.  These guys are truly brilliant at crafting sounds that evoke emotion, mixing harsh and lush just right.  Nothing can possibly touch OK Computer but Pablo Honey gives me some of the same joy.
B00004RF9I|4.0|1976 was more or less a bleak year for the movies.  For fun, we had THE BAD NEWS BEARS and KING KONG, and for emotional drama, we had ROCKY for best picture.  NETWORK combines comedy and drama with a socio-political edge as it profiles a struggling New York City TV network breaking into what would much later be known as \\"Reality TV\\", by creating a weekly show that follows the activities of a terrorist group. <br /> <br />And then, of course, there's \\"The Howard Beals Show\\" with Peter Finch's legenday outraged screen antics; a precursor to Morton Downey Jr. or Jerry Springer. <br /> <br />But I gotta say, there is one thing I'm \\"as mad as hell\\" about!  Will someone please explain to me how Beatrice Straight could win the Academy Award for best supporting actress for less than 15 minutes of screen time???
B000078DOI|5.0|i think this album is pretty much insane. there's energy flowing through each track, to blow your brains off. i don't think it's necessarily their best work, but hell, i can never really decide which one is. i just love it to death, you really need to hear this if you haven't heard anything off it yet. there's a lot of funk, sex, and love in it... it's crazy. anthony's vocals are great, the bass in freaking insane! john plays amazing, too, even tho i prefer what he did in BSSM. to me, this album marks the spot where they finally were able to unite their onstage energy and their studio skills perfectly. i recommend it in a 100%.
B00005JOII|5.0|First I want to offer something of a disclosure. I don't quite understand all this talk of \\"Match Point\\" being considered Woody Allen's \\"comeback\\". Woody Allen never went away. I, in complete contradiction to the American public, have actually found that I have enjoyed Allen's recent efforts. I like \\"Melinda and Melinda\\", \\"Anything Else\\", and \\"Small Time Crooks\\". I've enjoyed all of Allen's films to various degrees. So, while I'm glad the public and the critics are finally starting to wake up and appreciate Allen's latest film, to me it is not a \\"comeback\\".<br /><br /> \\"Match Point\\", as has been so aptly pointed out by critics and the lucky few whom have managed to see advance screening has a completely different look from Allen's previous films, but this different look is only because Allen has shot this movie in London instead of his beloved New York, but everything else about this picture is pure Woody Allen. We are dealing with the same themes, we are getting the same view of middle to upper class society, and the same bits of dialogue as characters enjoy the high arts and quote literature to one another. And I'm not saying this as a fault. I'm glad the movie isn't as different as some people are letting on. I did after all pay to see a \\"Woody Allen picture\\".<br /><br /> What makes \\"Match Point\\" though different from previous Allen films is first of all this one is a pure drama, not a half drama like \\"Melinda and Melinda\\". And it's also not a Bergmanesque drama in the tradition of \\"Interiors\\" or \\"September\\". It resembles, if anything, \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\".<br /><br /> But there is more to the movie than strictly the drama. To my surprise Allen showcases a great ability at being able to create suspense. And I mean he does it really well. We're talking about Hitchcock level here.<br /><br /> As far as the plot goes, I'm sorry but I can't tell you anything major. I walked into the movie cold. I went out of my way to avoid hearing anything about the movie. For a Woody Allen film there was certainly a lot of buzz floating around the picture. And I want your experience to be the same as mine. To discover the plot secrets right there in the theater was amazing. Had I known everything in advance the effect of the movie may very well have been different.<br /><br /> \\"Match Point\\" stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a former tennis pro, Chris Wilton, who is now reduced to teaching instead of playing. But all is well, or least it will be. Chris meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who he gives lessons to. The two instantly hit it off and become good friends, they both even share a love of opera. It is when Chris is invited to attend with Tom he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister. Chloe also takes an instant liking to Chris and soon things get complicated and my description of the movie will have to stop there.<br /><br /> The two best performances in the movie I feel belong to Mortimer and Scarlett Johansson, who has already received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Hopefully both ladies will receive Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress. But between the two I must admit I do prefer Mortimer. It also helps she is given more screen time so we have more opportunities to care about her character.<br /><br /> Now is \\"Match Point\\" really Allen's best film in a decade as some critics are saying? Probably. But isn't it odd for us to say Allen's best movie is a drama? Here is a man whom we usually identify with comedies. But \\"Match Point\\" is a movie that will not have cross over appeal. I have said it before and I will say it again, Woody Allen will no longer make any new fans. People who say they don't like him simply don't like him and will never give any of his films a chance, they simply walk in with a bad attitude, so no matter how good the movie may be they will always be disappointed. For the rest of us though \\"Match Point\\" is one of Allen's bravest films to date and one of 2005's best films.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Woody Allen's most complex, daring films in years. One of the year's best.of the year's best.
B000002AP1|5.0|this record is so good... i couldn't believe it, it's officially the best goddamn record i own. it's so amazingly strange, that this particular album that everyone was opposed to, and that nobody wanted to release, was so freaking ahead of its time. even today, 21st century, you won't find anything nearly as powerful, raw, loud, fast, as Iggy & the Stooges. Iggy stated himself the stooges were kinda nasty, but when they got together, > this happened, and thank god they did get together. I enjoyed it so much, I really did. I'm really glad I can listen to this (I garantee this will set yr speakers on fire) whenever all the lame crap on the radio annoys me. Honestly, Iggy's mix is pretty good, it's powerful, and it captures the orginal high-voltage sound of the band. We're lucky he did it and the label didn't do it by itself. <br />Standout tracks are Gimme Danger, Raw Power, Search & Destroy, Shake Appeal, I Need Somebody, hell the whole album is a standout. That's the great thing about \\"short\\" albums, if they're good, they're good. Iggy didn't include any *fillers*, each track is as strong as the next. You HAVE to buy this, BECAUSE. You can't be a rock fan without experiencing this, because that's what it is, an experience. For as much as I like to be objective, I can't, because my impression was really strong when I gave this the first listen. In general, the booklet is pretty, the photographs are pretty cool, Iggy was one sexy beast. The interview is very funny and of course very informative. There's no way you can regret it. They don't make em like this anymore.

B00006RCNW|4.0|I absolutely love The Shield.  It's one of the few programs that frames gender, class and race in a way that doesn't come across as preachy while still keeping in tone with an incredibly realistic \\"cop drama\\" feel.   <br /> <br />My issues are with the lack of a \\"play all\\" feature.  (Personally, this drives me absolutely batty.)  The majority of TV on DVD sets I own are priced lower than The Shield and all of them include a \\"play all\\" feature.  Otherwise, I don't have any issues with the DVDs themselves.  The extras are cool, especially the commentary given before each deleted scene, so I guess that's the tradeoff?  Hmph.
0385512058|2.0|I found this book to be boring and too full of the authors ego. We could all have a rolodex of big-shots names if we started out in the in-crowd, had assistants to do research on the people who would be at conventions, and wrote a book. Most of the tactics listed in the book, would get us ostracized from every club we wanted to be in. They are impractical and rude at the least.  <br />The incessant name dropping and the \\" I was a poor boy who made it big\\" story, took up most of the pages. Save your money!

B000024D4R|5.0|Still one of the most fascinating of Pink Floyd's albums, and the one that tends to get overlooked in favour of the more acclaimed likes of Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and The Wall.  It's also one of the more difficult albums of their later career, building around three songs that each clock in at over ten-minutes and two short bookends that both introduce and bring to a close the overall themes and motifs behind the album.  As most people are aware (even those who haven't heard the album, but are familiar with it's history) Animals takes it's lyrical and ideological cue from Orwell and, in particular, his classic Animal Farm.  The three main songs - Pigs, Dogs and Sheep - use the same animal analogies to dissect the bloated face of Great Britain circa '77, with direct references to the self-righteous upper classes (Pigs), the totalitarian government (Dogs) and the mindless, classless workers (Sheep).  The lyrics by Roger Waters point the finger at each group and offer some of the coldest and most heartless exchanges ever committed to tape. <br /> <br />The album sounds like a complete musical U-turn away from the territory of Wish You Were Hear, with the ambient synth and acoustic guitars of that album being replaced by cold, dissonant keyboards and angular, electric guitar madness.  It manages to predate their hugely successful double album The Wall in terms of sheer sound and vastness, but replaces the navel-gazing and self-pity of songs like Comfortably Numb and Nobody Home with something much darker, abrasive and discontented.  Like Wish You Were Here, the short number of songs is really a hint that the whole album should be viewed as a complete piece of work, with the songs moving in and out of each other and also, in and out of various mid-song movements.  It's not out of the ordinary here for a song to begin with an eerie keyboard refrain backed by an acoustic guitar, only to shift into something heavier, with buzz-saw guitars, heavy bass-lines and furiouspercussion.  As a result, it certainly shows Pink Floyd at their tightest musically, as they offer a selection of different speeds, tempos and atmospheres.  It ends up sounding like a punk album before most punk acts had even jumped on the bandwagon, but at the same time, ends up as possibly the band's most 'progressive' album, with the long songs, over-bearing concepts and dense production ultimately having more in common with Genesis than Sham 69. <br /> <br />The lulled opening Pigs On The Wing 1, with its gentle folk guitar and distant organ comes across like a (musical) wolf in sheep's clothing (sorry!!), as the gentle melody and lyrical allusions to love and happiness essentially giving way to the regret, disappointment and desperation that will flourish throughout the proceeding 40-plus minutes.  So, if the iconography of the artwork doesn't clue you in (the overcast sky, the enormous power station, the lone pig floating through the ether, the dark red bricks, broken windows and barbed wire of the near-by security offices suggesting anarchy, unease and rampant totalitarianism) then the opening line of Dogs certainly will; \\"you gott'a be crazy, you gott'a have a real need... you've gott'a sleep on your toes, when you're on your feet, you got to be able, to pick out the easy meat\\".  The sound of Dogs gets more and more intense as it moves ever forward, with Dave Gilmour laying down some extraordinarily dexterous lead work and at least three standout solos throughout the monumental 17-plus minute running time. <br /> <br />The rest of the band are on top form too, with Nick Mason offering some powerhouse percussion, from seemingly improvised moments in those lengthy instrumental breaks, which brings to mind jazz and classical influences as opposed to straight-rock, and then there's the extraordinary organ/keyboard work from Rick Wright, who creates much of the musical textures and underlining sense of foreboding, particularly the album's centrepiece Sheep, in which he really deserved a co-song writing credit for the sheer enormity of his musical contribution.  Waters offers a few decent bass-lines, as well as supposedly playing acoustic guitar on the first and final track, but it's his skill as a lyricist that really impresses here.  The range of ideas conveyed throughout is spellbinding, as Waters offers moments of soul-searching emotion, spiteful caricature (the description of Mary Whitehouse on Pigs springs to mind) and snarling satire. <br /> <br />With the three songs that create the core of Animals, Waters ably establishes himself as one of the greatest rock lyricists/British poets of the last fifty years, easily showing fellow rock curmudgeons like Elvis Costello, Mark E. Smith, Luke Haines et al a thing or two when it comes to venting their musical spleen (the description of the central character in dogs is particularly cold, especially the central verse; \\"and in the end you'll pack up, and fly down south, hide your head in the sand, just another sad old man, all alone, dying of cancer\\").  The climax of Dogs is one of the most hate filled diatribe ever presented on record, as Waters and Co. cut through the heart of the oppressors and their lives of contradiction (\\"who was born in house of pain... who was fitted with collar and chain... who was ground down in the end... who was found dead on the phone... dragged down by the stone\\" etc).  The bile continues throughout the rest of the album, with Pigs using it's three verses to cut up the moral majority (\\"bus stop rat-bag... ha-ha, charade you are... you f*cked up old hag... ha-ha charade you are\\"), whilst Wright offers a surprisingly funky keyboard grove and few piano fills that bring to mind Abba's Dancing Queen (!!), whilst Gilmour, again, offers some solid guitar work and a storming, over-the-top epic of a guitar solo to bring us to a close. <br /> <br />I've hardly mentioned Sheep, though suffice to say it continues the bleak and unapologetic sound, this time focusing on the underclass, as it's lyrical target.  It's easily as essential as both Dogs and Pigs, and leads us nicely into the sweet reprise of Pigs on the Wing 2, with Waters bringing this cold and oppressive album to a close with a sense of hope and that sweet closing line... \\"only a fool knows, a dog needs a home, a shelter, from pigs on the wing\\".
B000B8QF14|3.0|No doubt this dvd was very entertaining, getting to see them play a live show and all the interviews and other stuff...it was pretty cool.  But I am personally very disapointed in them.  Like first of all, they are no longer a 3-piece...they now have like 6 members in their band. Another thing is how they dress the same at like every live show...that is kinda dumb...it's like they are like following a label or something.  Another thing is how they kinda changed their style..they aren't really that raw punk rock like they used to, they kinda sound like every other new punk band that's out there. And yet another thing is how they are like all political in their music writing these days.  I liked the earlier green day days when all they wrote about was being bored and stuff like that.  So it might be me, but I am very disapointed in them....I miss the good old green days....
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm a long-time U2 fan - I have all their albums, most of their singles/B-sides (imported and domestic), some bootlegs, etc.  And I disagree with some of the other fans who say that this album is sub-par.  I think it's really great.  No, it's not ground-breaking like Achtung Baby - not every album can be.  It's just good music and good lyrics.  I highly recommend.
1576751988|5.0|This book is perhaps the best by Brian Tracy and his most overlooked. Why is it that some people think you need a 400 page tome that essentiallys ays nothing?

Keep in mind, these people make money teaching and have never owned a business, been in sales and so on. <br /> <br />Brian Tracy has been there and created as well as turned around many businesses. He is a super successful salesman. And he is also highly educated in the mainstream manner, although that is of least significance to me. <br /> <br />As a 30+ something husband and father of two, time is of the essence for me. I need to maximize every moment. Get the most from my business and spend as much free time as possible with family.

0375707972|4.0|Some things in life are just inexplicable. In a rational world, we spew forth words to express meaning, as though we really \\"know\\" something. In The Reader, we are faced with a story where the familiar is just a facade; like a building in war torn Germany. Underneath that facade there is a 15-year old boy trying to be a man. There is a 36-year old woman trying survive in literate world with an inability to read. There is a mother and daughter deserving justice, who never find it, even when their perpetrator sentenced in a court of law and dies in prison. There are silent victims who speak loudly from the grave, but are only faintly heard. Most inexplicable, is human compassion, where one can love even heineous war criminal, yet not \\"know\\" them for who they truly are.
0316172324|3.0|This book has become widely popular, even to the point where stores were selling out of copies before the holidays. People have been flocking to this title with anxious anticipation. My pre-read mentality was slightly different because of what I thought about Gladwell's other book, The Tipping Point, but I will go into more depth on that later. <br /> <br />I cannot explain why my expectations were what they were, but whatever the reason(s) behind them, they were not met. I happened to believe that this book, as different from the author's other, might actually be about skills and techniques to practice in an effort to better one's self in the art of making snap decisions. That is the premise of the book; ideas around making educated decisions quickly rather than after exhaustive research efforts.  <br /> <br />As I began the book I became increasingly afraid it would simply be a collection of anecdotes about people who are able to make smart decisions in the blink of an eye. You have to figure that no one would buy a book that was just stories about people who are better at what they do than you are at what you do, right? ...Right? Or maybe such a book would fly off the shelves. Weird. <br /> <br />Where I looked to find examples of what other people have done in their lives to better prepare themselves to make decisions I found story after story about experts in respective fields. These people have not trained in some strange Zen custom to be able to focus their mind on the correct decision; they have simply spent countless hours at their craft. The only reason these people can make snap decisions and eliminate the time otherwise spent on researching the situation is because they devoted the earlier portion of their lives to that research.  <br /> <br />The idea of the book, from how I interpreted it may be summed up as this: If you want to be able to decrease the amount of time it takes you to make a decision, whether it be in your business life, your personal life, or your spiritual life, all you need to do is know your product. Take time with each and every aspect. With time you will by default become so experienced with most situations that making decisions will be relatively routine.  <br /> <br />The subjects of Gladwell's examples are the tops in their industries because they have become experts in what they do...over time. And there is the key point. You, too, can make snap decisions if you become knowledgeable on the topic. But that takes time. <br /> <br />The issue from The Tipping Point that I found had reincarnated itself in Blink was depth. Malcolm Gladwell writes, in both books, about what I consider to be good ideas. He has my attention. I desire to read what he has to say on the subjects. The level of his research is never questioned. I can tell that he is very thorough as he gathers the information for his books. He falls short, however, in analysis. The ideas are great, and the information is there, but at the end of both books I felt wanting for more expansion. Maybe it was a flaw in my reading that I felt some topics could have used more elaboration, but then again maybe you will agree.  <br /> <br />I sound as if I am down on the book, and for how it contrasted with my expectations of it, I am. I am not, however, completely dissatisfied with it in its entirety. I found the details of how people have carved out their particular niche very fascinating. The research done by the author was impressive. The variety of examples he brought together under the umbrella of decision making was what interested me most. If only knowing the many different categories that food experts use to rate mayonnaise could help me in my life's pursuit... <br /> <br />As a short book that can be read rather quickly, even by slow readers such as myself, I still think Blink is worth reading if only from the perspective of the curious. I believe the book has more to offer than that, but it is a good starting point in your motivationto read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I would like to say first, you didn't create the movie, all this was Lucas's choice. The changes are very minor, and it some of it makes the movies better.<br /><br />I have been a star wars fan since I was a kid, and I was going to wait for a six movie box set to come out, but I couldn't wait so I went ahead and bought it. All three dvds are great and the bonus disc is awesome. I learned so much off this, and there is some really interesting information on that disc too.<br /><br />So if your a star wars fan, you must go out and buy this. Throw yourself a nice Star Wars marathon with some friends.

B000002AS3|5.0|Oasis is most well-known for their monster album \\"What's The Story (Morning Glory)\\", and rightfully so. That album delivered 3 classic Beatles-esque songs  - \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\". Though this album does not have any \\"classics\\" on it per se (two songs come close), overall it's just a great album with a high amount of energy. All the different parts of the songs (the singer, drums, guitars, etc.) tend to all sound like they're on the same level, but that doesn't effect the songs too too much. The last song, \\"Married With Children\\", is a pretty funny addition considering it's a very slow song compared to the rest of the album. The lyrics, if you can make them out, are usually very meaningful. Noel Gallagher does a great job fitting the band's grungy britpop style as he is a very good singer and is definitely likable (he sounds a lot like The Beatles, but that's not really a bad thing, is it?). Every track here is good-if-not great, but I think the real stand-out tracks are \\"Up In The Sky\\" and \\"Live Forever\\" (which I think was a hit). These two songs just KILL! I would've given this a \\"4.5\\", but these two songs definitely bump it up to a \\"5\\". If you're looking for a great (britpop) album with a high dosage of energy, then Oasis' \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is definitely (maybe) the album to get (har har)! Rock fans will most likely dig this!    Highlights include:  the entire album, though \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Up In The Sky\\" are the \\"best\\"
B00026WU9Q|5.0|bob dylan the poetic genius he will have you scrathing your head at his wonderful witty lyrics and the full force of the statements he's talkin' about his first few album were very polictally charged affairs and it's a wonderful affair on the 19965 classic \\"bringin' it all home\\"   dylan is really the wordsmith that the beatles well lennon and mccartney leeched off to make their success...  dylan was the one who asked lennon and mccartney in 1965 why that haven't written any polictal records weird indeed..  not many artist can pull of writing big statements with such ease and humour like dylan did...he made it sound so easy..  this album is all you need for a good back in the day when poltics were still important..not like today with the bumblin' bamboons...classic dylan
B000002BSG|5.0|Jamiroquai's best known song is probably the hit \\"Virtual Insanity\\" from the 90's (although recently \\"Canned Heat\\" is pretty well-known ever since Napoleon Dynamite came out (that's the song he danced to at the end)) and rightfully so. This is probably the \\"best\\" song on the album, but the rest of the songs are pretty much just as good. Every song here is good-if-not-great, with the whole album being incredibly groovy and funky at the same time. Jamiroquai has a very odd voice (he sounds feminine at times), but he somehow manages to make it work with the material he has. This is an extremely fun record that most people will like a lot (it has lots of appeal). The lyrics don't really matter here - it's the musicianship that's key. It's indeed a very funky record with obvious jazz influences, and it's all brought together with a pounding drum beat. He also uses one of the most under-used instruments of all time - the didgeridoo (on \\"Didjerama\\" and \\"Didjital Vibrations\\" - cool stuff!)! Definitely a unique and fun record that most people will enjoy. It's barely a classic, but it is for four reasons: every song is good, it's extremely appealing to most people, it's unique and it has several classic songs (\\"Use The Force\\" and \\"Virtual Insanity\\" being a couple). Highly recommended!    Hightlights include:  the entire album!
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|OK. I get the feeling that most people that are giving bad reviews of \\"First impressions of earth\\" haven't heard it enough times. There's even one reviewer who was reviewing it on the same day he'd bought it. That's totally ridiculous and pretentious. Of course the guy gave it a bad review, who can get used to (and understand) a band's new sound on the first day they hear it???? Nobody. <br />This is why I decided to wait at least four days before writing my review, in order to familiarize myself with the songs. Here's my opinion: <br /> <br />I think it's The Strokes' weakest album to date, but after releasing such great albums as the first two, you must understrand that weak for the strokes actually means pretty good. The problem is that we've become too demanding with the strokes, because they are so good, but they can't keep releasing a masterpiece every three years. <br />I think the album is nice to listen to. They still sound like the strokes,although they are trying new directions but the overall sound is the same. <br />Julian's lyrics are more mature and \\"philosophical\\" which I think is a good thing. <br />However, the album is lacking great songs with great choruses shouted out loud. I don't see any \\"strokes classic\\" coming out here. Also the mood of the album is less upbeat and fun than on the first album (the second one was already less upbeat). <br />My favourite tracks on the album are \\"You only live once\\"  \\"Heart in a cage\\" \\"Killing lies\\" \\"Fear of sleep\\" and \\"Red light\\". <br />The best song on the album by far is \\"Red light\\". Truly brilliant. <br /> <br />That's all. Don't listen to people who've just bought the record, in a week they will have changed their minds. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" are THE definitive grunge albums, and it really shows. Kurt Cobaine's voice perfectly suits the musical style, and gives each song an edge that other bands would kill for. Every song here is great (though some are \\"better\\" than others, and \\"Polly\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\" are arguably the weakest), and there are even four grunge classics here (\\"Smells Like Team Spirit\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Lithium\\"). Lyrically all the songs are interesting to listen to, albeit pretty depressing some of the time. Musically this is just a fantastic album - it's on par with Beatles and Dylan albums in terms of its influence on the music industry. The production is great and the musicianship is pretty much perfect. \\"Nevermind\\" essentially popularized the genre while \\"In Utero\\" introduced it to the world. Most people will really like these two albums. If you like this album I also highly recommend the Goo Goo Dolls' \\"A Boy Named Goo\\". This is a great album that's highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album (\\"Polly\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\" are arguably the weakest\\")
B0002F6B7Y|4.0|Dogville is the type of depressingly disturbing film that will leave an impression on the viewer whether they love or hate it. This very worthy and very long piece of 'parable' which explores the darkest and most primal side of human nature, and a side which potentionally lurks within all of us, would obviously work equally well in the theatre. The Brechtian alienation techniques clearly apparent in the floor marked rehearsal 'style' set, deliberatley underplayed performances and fairytale style narration. But this story is anything but a fairytale, infact the total antitheses. Set in a small isolated American town during the depression, 'Dogville', or at least elements of it, could of course exist anywhere (hence the undetailed and unrealistic set). The film pulls no punches in its grittingly bleak representation of human beings at their worst in desperate times. A small seemingly simple and welcoming community who reveal their true colours as they gradually begin to turn on the weaker member of the herd, the vulnerable outsider, like a flock of relentless vultures who have smelled the blood. Grace's(supposed) passive co-operativeness and'niceness' is rewarded at first but then becomes an easy target for exploitation and hideous abuse, as the villagers take advantage of her needy dilema. <br />The film asks many moral and hypothetical questions in its allegory, and then finally answers them in the most unexpectedly shocking and brutal way at the film's climax, prompting the audience then to ask yet more questions. This is a deeply provoking and intellectual film, those looking for a relaxing night of popcorn and entertainment should give this one a miss. It's heavy chewing for the mind and blatantly confronting and hardhitting in its content. <br />The strength of the movie is in the story and universal themes and questions it raises. This is my opinion, is not an 'actors' film. It's a writer/directors piece that could be played by no-bodies and probably would havemore impact if it was, though not the commercial recognition. I didn't find Nicole Kidman's performance anything outstanding frankly, to me she seemed to be acting half asleep throughout the movie as if she was tranquillized. But in all honesty none of the actors performances stand out in my mind. Although they were certainly all equally worthy and more than adequate, the controversial nature of the story is what holds your attention, providing enough intellectual debate for a university theses, and that more than likely, is director Lars Von Triers intention.
B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotel is definitely a band that's not for everyone, but if you have an open mind then you will see that \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" is just a beautiful album! There's nothing out there (at least, not at this period in time) that sounds anything like this, and this gives the album a great edge (it's just INTERESTING!). The production here is crisp and clear, and Jeff Mangum has a pretty good psychedelic voice which is pretty off-kilter most of the time (he can't hold his notes at all, but it gives the album a special charm). Every track on this album is invigorating and fun! The lyrics are pretty bizarre most of the time, but that only adds to its charm (I mean just listen to the rest of the instruments - they perfectly match what he's singing about). Musically it's a very lo-fi album which fuses together numerous amount of instruments that barely any band ever uses, and they do it effortlessly (lots of horns and trumpets...etc.). You'll love hearing the intricacies of this band (it's worthy of repeated listens!). Fans of indie rock, psychedelic rock and those with an open mind should love this album!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|As I listened to this album with my friend he brought up a good point; The Strokes made another flawless 11-track cd. However, this album has 14 songs. There are, regrettably, some up's and downs in this album. The first 8 tracks are all really solid.<br /><br />The opener- \\"You Only Live Once\\" has the sharp guitars, bouncy basslines, and rat-tat-tat drums that are so undeniably \\"strokes\\" and it feels so good. Julian sings better than ever before, in my opinion, and has really grown as a vocalist. When he sings \\"I can't see the sunshine\\" you get the feeling you're in for a different experience with this album- it's a good way to adjust the listener from Is This It/Room on Fire into First Impressions.. Baby steps..<br /><br />Then Juicebox hits and it comes with both guns blazing. This single is no doubt going to sell this record. I could go on about why this song rocks and rocks it hard but I think it's kind of obvious. I'm reminded of Reptilia when I listen to it- only it's a much better song. It's not so far off the mark from the 2 previous albums and I love it. My only regret about this song is that it doesn't fit into the rest of the album. The other albums blended together so nicely and, at times, First Impressions.. feels choppy. They didn't start out with the single as #1 on the tracklisting like Beck's E-Pro on Guero so for that I like them a little more.<br /><br />Track 3 \\"Heart In A Cage\\" The songwriting really gets kicked up a notch here and Julian starts his repeating lyrics with the refrain of \\"left left left..\\" I, for one, like the repeated themes and enjoy the scope of this song. It's not as, well, \\"strokesy\\" as 'You Only Live Once' but that's because they're ushering you in to the new sound.<br /><br />The poorly named \\"Razorblade\\" comes up next and chills you out to the bone. It's very lounged-out and has perfectly leveled guitars along with some great vocals from Julian as he sings \\"my feelings are more important than yours\\"<br /><br />Yes! Track 5 \\"On The Other Side\\" prepare yourself to get your ass bass-guitar'd and drummed off. The rhythm section really shines here and it's clear how much more of an emphasis was put on Nikolai for this album. However, unlike a lot of Strokes songs the bass doesn't follow the vocal part giving this a very different sound. But the best part about this song is how un-strokes it is at one moment but then again it really is very familiar. The muted guitar swipes from Albert and Nick are ever-present just like on any song from Is This It along with a few Hard-To-Explain-ish moments of silence. It feels nice to know our boys from 2001 are still here baried beneath sub-par Pitchfork reviews.<br /><br />Track 6- Vision of Division has an amazing intro. You'll be hard-pressed not to tap atleast one toe. The rocking drops out but not for long and is soon accompanied by some of the best guitar work on the album. Listen for the 1:50 solo. Kudos you string-jockeys, kudos.<br /><br />Track 7- my personal favorite \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is a guitarless gem. A synth-cello loop and Julian's vocals pour out of my earbuds and I can't stop clicking repeat. His repetition of \\"I've got nothing to say\\" gives you chills as you realize this guy actually has a really great voice. It's not hiding behind sound-effected mics or basement recording equipment. It's not garage rock, it's not guitars, it's not the strokes. This is new Strokes and it just goes to show that change isn't bad so long as it's done right. I could take a whole other album of this. The liner notes say this music was arranged by Julian and Nick so when the postal-service-esque side project of Casablancas/Valensi comes out I'll be first in line.<br /><br />track 8 \\"ElectricityScape\\" is undeniably dark and undeniably rock at its finest. Julian's lyrics finally stand up on their own as some of the best writing he's done to date and all the instrumentation fits so tightly it's nigh impossible to skip this. The guitars kick in at 1:30 and you're reminded of why you loved the strokes in the first place. My only problem with this song, and this remains true for other tracks, are the levels. They feel off. Sometimes the sound feels too mushed together and, unlike on other albums, you can't have fun listening for different sections like guitars in your left ear, etc. Think of the guitar-style on 'Someday'-- well this isn't that.<br /><br />track 9 \\"Killing Lies\\" isn't a bad song but it's the first song I find that, after many many listens, still don't find myself loving as much as the top 8 I just discussed. It's unfair to expect every song to be a homerun but when I'm most honest with myself I feel bored around this part of the album. That's not to say that Killing Lies is a boring song- it isn't. It's just that we're past the halfway mark of this 52-minute album and the Stroke's newfound longwindedness might be hampering their ability to keep you drawn in and connected to the entire album.<br /><br />Luckily, track 10 \\"Fear Of Sleep\\" revives the rock senses and the  regular Strokes-style returns triumphantly and Julian's yelling of \\"you're not fun\\" gets me just as riled up as his first demands to \\"take it or leave it\\" When this song fades I'm always left thining it'd be a much better album closer.<br /><br />But we slip back into this 3/4 album slump with \\"Evening Sun\\". The placement of this song might be what makes me feel put off by it. It's got everything a good song needs- the music is lush and the singing is spot on. I'd really like this if it were put into different context but right now it slows down the momentum of this album. As a song  on its own, it works wonders but it also plays into the aforementioned problem First Impressions... suffers from which is a choppy feeling. The album overall lacks a  feeling of connectivity between songs.<br /><br />track 12- \\"Ize of The World\\"<br /><br />even the Strokes can write songs that aren't fun to listen to. It feels like this was thrown together using parts from all the songs above. It sounds like a half-baked half-realized concept for a song. Apart from the bad title, the lackluster sensation I get from this song continues the anxiety I get near the end of this album<br /><br />track 13- \\"15 Minutes\\"<br /><br />despite the fact that the melody in the vocals is strinkingly similar to the chorus of \\"Modern Age\\" i still like this song mainly because it showcases the differences the strokes made in this album and proves just how far they've come as songwriters. They've matured from lines like \\"When we was young ah man did we have fun\\" to picturesque musical scores that accompany words like \\"Someday you'll come back and I'll be dreaming of a sundown\\" and a beautifully sung chorus like \\"amber evening sun\\"<br /><br />track 14- \\"Red Light\\"<br /><br />Though this isn't the most exciting track the Strokes have left off with as an album closer it's still a really well-done track. The guitars flow up and down the scale, the vocals howl away, and the rhythm section moves us along nicely. This song reminds us that by listening to this album we just got a 52-minute vacation.<br /><br />Again, with the minor exceptions of some songs about 3/4 of the way through their are still without a doubt 11 amazing songs on this album. The Strokes have certainly done something different with their sound and for 4 out of 5 stars of the time they're successful. The only real cons to this album are the omitiing of \\"Hawaii\\"- a song off the Juicebox single and a few tracks that speed this thing way down when it could open up so much more.<br /><br />If I were going to reorder this album my tracklisting would look something like:<br /><br />1. You Only Live Once<br /><br />2. Juicebox<br /><br />3. Heart In A Cage<br /><br />4. Razorblade<br /><br />5. On The Other Side<br /><br />6. Vision of Division<br /><br />7. Ask Me Anything<br /><br />8. Electricityscape<br /><br />9. Hawaii<br /><br />10.Fear of Sleep<br /><br />11.15 Minutes<br /><br />12.Red Light<br /><br />I'd add one of the best songs they've done, \\"Hawaii\\" from the Juicebox single, and take out some of the riff-raff that really bogs this album down into the boring realm 3/4 of the way through.like this was thrown together using parts from all the songs above.

B00005Y1TL|5.0|Though Aphex Twin's \\"Selected Ambient Works: 85-92\\" is primarily an ambient piece, it actually has some great appeal. Songs like \\"Xtal\\", \\"Tha\\" and \\"Pulsewidth\\" are incredibly relaxing and soothing pieces (ambient classics!). The electronic noises are superb - you'll love most every song on this album. There are no voice samples here; everything is digital. Every song, except for \\"Green Calx\\" (which is kind've interesting) is, essentially, an ambient masterpiece (though \\"Ptolemy\\" is more energetic and less ambient). If you're looking for an incredibly relaxing album then \\"Selected Ambient Works: 85-92\\" is a very very good purchase (along with B12's \\"Electro-Soma\\", The Orb's \\"Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld\\" and Boards Of Canada's \\"Music Has The Right To Children\\"). Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  everything except for \\"Green Calx\\"
1563898586|4.0|Borrowing characters from literature is nothing new in comics. Mr. Hyde has popped up from time to time in the Marvel Universe, and both Marvel and DC have used Greek and Norse gods in their stories. What makes the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen unique is two things. First, it collects many of these popular literary characters, including Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, Sherlock Holmes, and C. Auguste Dupin, among others. Second, Alan Moore wields the history behind all of these characters incredibly well. He's done his research and nails down even obscure details about the characters in establishing the setting. Did you know that Edward Hyde was initially smaller than Henry Jekyll? Moore does, and he explains why Hyde is now a large monstrous creature instead of the small ape-like man in the original story. The characters are treated as though they came right out of their respective source material. Very few inaccuracies can be found, making the group very enjoyable to those who have a particular love for any of the original stories written by H.G. Wells, Bram Stoker, and others. <br /> <br />Once the group comes together, seeing them interact is more fun than reading about their actual mission. Hyde and the Invisible Man are both monsters who are barely kept in line by Mina's leadership. Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's tales is even more frightening once a fight begins. The delicate balance of the group is very intriguing and sets the stage for a blowup that is certain to occur in future volumes. For now, however, the misfit band of literary characters battles to save England while getting to know one another. <br /> <br />The story is very enjoyable but not overly deep in this volume; the collection of issues gives just enough time to get to know the group before the adventure ends. The art style is unique and takes a bit of getting used to, but ultimately lends a unique perspective to the bizarre version of 19th century Britain. Ultimately,this volume of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a fun read and a good introduction to build on in the group's future adventures.
B000006UNG|5.0|The 80's was a decade filled with great new wave songs - A-Ha's \\"Take On Me\\" is but one example. What separates Talk Talk from, say, A-Ha is how creative they are - they definitely follow standard song structure here, but the instrumentation is very organic and spontaneous at times. You can tell these guys aren't simply trying to cash in on a popular genre. This is most clearly evident when one listens to the album that follows this one, \\"Spirit Of Eden\\", which completely abandons new wave in favor of post-rock/experimental/ambient rock. These guys are, simply put, overlooked geniuses (if you were to ask most people if they ever heard of Talk Talk, I'm pretty sure almost everyone would say no). Mark Hollis' voice is very new wave - he has a distinctly 80's sound and his voice sounds like he's a little timid. The lyrics are pretty good, but it's not really the focus of the songs. It's mainly a nice and atmospheric new wave album - the instrumentation is the key. Every song features extremely creative ideas that verges on experimental rock. Most people should really like this album as well as its follow-up \\"Spirit Of Eden\\". This album also features lesser-known 80's hits including \\"Happiness Is Easy\\" and \\"Life's What You Make It\\". If you're looking for a great new wave record, \\"The Color Of Spring\\" will amaze you. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />the entire album!
068987474X|4.0|When this book came out a year or so ago, I recall the great flap it caused from women. So much so that a book was written as almost a response piece.<br /><br />While some women appreciated the brutal honesty it offered ('thank you for helping me read between the lines and understand what a guy is saying by his actions,' in essence), others were sharply insulted that somehow it denegrated single women, self-perceived as discarded and undesirable.<br /><br />Both miss the real point underlying the book. Guys flake because they've tried the honest approach and can't suffer another emotional meltdown. So they resort to being flakey, which they know most women can't stand and won't put up with.<br /><br />Hopefully the real lesson of the book (accept the differences, or lack of mutual chemistry, and move on) will become part of the collective discussion this provocative book offers.<br /><br />- GiddyupGuy.com
B000002UB3|5.0|If you haven't heard of The Beatles you must honestly be living under a rock. They are EASILY the best band in the world - not only do they have three great songwriters, but they have a great bassist, drummer, guitarist, and singer, not to mention the most amount of classic albums out of any other band in existence (so far). What more could you possibly ask for? Every track here is a classic pop rock song as The Beatles essentially created that genre (EVERY band copies them). \\"Abbey Road\\" is but one of many Beatles classics that every self-respecting music fan should own. \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Come Together\\" are but a few of the many classic songs found here on this album. This is a must for ANYBODY who likes music (along with basically all the other Beatles albums). I can't recommend this highly enough!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00005ATZT|5.0|This movie is a couple years old, but I've liked it since the first time I saw it.  I finally decided to buy it on dvd instead of wait for it to be re-run on tv.
B00006IU73|3.0|Porcupine Tree's In Absentia starts off, much like Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\", with a MONSTER of a song - \\"Blackest Eyes\\" is one of few songs in the world that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. This song is a perfect example of Porcupine Tree's style as it incorporates elements of heavy metal, rock, and pop into one incredibly catchy, fun and interesting song. Sadly, the album gets noticably worse after this song. It's very uneven, and none of the songs come close to matching \\"Blackest Eyes\\"'s greatness. The singer has a pretty soothing voice - he definitely fits the \\"heavy metal/pop rock\\" style (actually the style is a *tad* reminiscent of Sunny Day Real Estate's \\"The Rising Tide\\"). Unfortunately, he IS a bit of a guilty pleasure - a lot of the songs you might hesitate to play in front of friends. This is a pretty original album that's similar to Radiohead (though not \\"greatly\\"), and although it's not for everyone I think the open-minded and curious will find it a bit interesting. \\"Blackest Eyes\\", alone, bumps it up from a \\"3\\" to a \\"3.5\\" and is essentially the best reason why you should buy this album, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it. <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />\\"Blackest Eyes\\" <br />\\"Trains\\" <br />\\"Gravity Eyelids\\" (sort of) <br />\\"Wedding Nails\\" (sort of) <br />\\"3\\" <br />\\"The Creator Has A Mastertape\\" (parts of it) <br />\\"Collapse The Light Into Earth\\"
B00005JOQ9|5.0|I think modern horror films are trying to isolate me.  After seeing Wolf Creek I don't want to go touristing in the outbacks of Australia.  Now I can check off Bratislava as a place to spend time partying in hostels.    Before I even saw this movie I was worried.  Not that the movie would terrible.  But that the movie would be almost too successful.  The idea is that, for the last half of this 95 minute movie, you are watching guys getting tortured, maimed and disfigured.  Take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film.    Now I have been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and probably before I should have.  But I have a firm grasp on reality and am a (mostly, haha) well-adapted 25 year old without a violent bone in my body.  I understand horror films and their cathartic feeling at the end.  Its all about tension and release, providing thrills and an adrenaline rush in the same way I imagine a person gets driving fast cars, jumping out of airplanes, etc.  The only difference is that in sitting in the movie theatre, I don't have to worry about crashing into anything.      What I am getting at is that there is a difference between reality and \\"reelity.\\"  I could easily sit back and decry this as being pornography of violence or no different than a snuff film (with the exception of the loss of life, granted).  Or I could look at it as the perfect exercise in terror.  For those interested in getting their thrills/adrenaline rush in the relative safety of a movie theatre, this film is the perfect way to do it.      It begins, ironically enough, as a buddy movie, back-packing in Europe ala Eurotrip.  There are three guys basically looking for pot and getting laid.  It has been the beginning to many a teen comedy and you can see what Eurotrip would have been had Cooper not gone to Wondersexxx but instead found this.  Ultimately ending up in Bratislava (just like in Eurotrip) at a Hostel, they realize they aren't getting what they expected.  What follows is a grisly tour of nightmarish proportions of torture and human trafficking for money.    When Eli Roth debuted with Cabin Fever, I saw a spark that this guy knew what he was doing.  I didn't particularly care for most of Cabin Fever (mostly because it was terribly miss-advertised) but I could tell he had a grasp on this horror thing.  And he had a handle on grim or dark comedy.  Hostel is disgusting, it will get beneath your skin much in the same way certain Asian horror films like Audition will.      What helps ground Hostel is the fact that the setup is quite  possible.  I'm never one to fully listen to the \\"Based on true events\\" hoopla a lot of horror films have been tossing around recently, but this is one film that you can see happening.  In a world that does have snuff films, hostels and people who have an amazing propensity for evil, things that happen in this film could happen.      I was afraid I wouldn't like this film.  I thought that maybe it would go too far past the line.  I won't lie and say its not a gross film because it is.  Its depictions of violence are horrific and there were a couple scenes in which I found myself looking away or cringing.  But Eli Roth does something interesting.  What a good horror film does is show us not only the horror in other people's psyche but also in our own.  Its not the monster under your bed you should be worried about, its some of the people out there.  Hostel shows this but also shows some of that in its protagonists.  There was a scene toward the end that has the whole theatre clapping and cheering.  It was a great scene but also illustrates my point.      Without adding to the considerable hype (Quentin Tarantino presenting it?  Check.  Both he and Robert Rodriguez claiming its the \\"scariest American horror film in a decade?\\" Check...) it can be considered a masterpiece of terror.  Wolf Creek was brutal but I enjoyed it.  Saw I and II showed more onscreen than I thought I would ever see in a theatre, but they were fun.  Hostel?  Hostel was an entirely different, more brutal beast.  I love horror films.  I have never had a nightmare after seeing them.  I'm not sure if this is an endorsement of the film, but, tonight, as silly as it might sound, I'm putting off going to sleep.
B000BQ7D9O|4.0|I watched this movie when it played in theatres and found it <br /> very entertaining. Diane Lane again takes a leading role in <br /> a romantic comedie and she is pretty funny as the   <br /> fourtysomething woman who is forced by her family to find <br /> a man. John Cusack is also pretty funny and entertaining in <br /> his own funny and (sometimes) weird way. Elizabeth Perkins <br /> role is also enjoyable. She plays Diane Lane`s sister who <br /> is very nosy and brings some chaos to the plot.
0140277447|4.0|A pretty good overview of the Nanking massacre and not a bad starting point for the subject. Chang takes some effort to show multiple perspectives on the events, though the book definately takes a stance of \\"the rape did happen, for certain\\". This insistence on acknowledgement of a tragedy is reasonable, and at the time of release this book rekindled international interest in a vitally important way.  <br /> <br />Chang's asessment of the overall situation, though, presents statistics that are within the realm of possibility, but very much on the high end of it. I'm not Japanese or a revisionist, but I've read other historians who said \\"The Rape of Nanking happened, it was ugly, and it must be remembered\\", yet claimed casualties as low as 150,000-200,000. You can tell the writing will be sensational just from looking at the cover, which features a gruesome photographic background and the word \\"rape\\" in enormous type, occupying much of the page. <br /> <br />The highlights of the book, for me, are the interviews with individuals who witnessed, or took part in, the massacre. They were diverse: remorseful Japanese soldiers, unrepentant Japanese soldiers, Japanese officers, Chinese survivors and western witnesses. The descriptions sometimes get repetitive in their carnage, but I understand Chang not wanting to leave out any of the testimonies she dug up, given the importance of the subject. So many raw, individual, eyewitness descriptions of horror makes the massacre nearly impossible to deny. <br /> <br />I suggest you read this book, and read some other, more moderate Rape of Nanking literature as well. You can leave alone the works of revisionist Japanese spin doctors, which invariably review great among fellow Japanese revisionists while the international community turns away in disgust. Simply find another, similar book a bit less sensational in tone, for contrast.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|Man this guy has fans and haters in all catagories!! Some of the teeny-bopper girls hate this new disk because its not pop, a few still scream for him 'cus a dude with guitar can do that to some girls. The blues fans hate the fact that somebody who prevously did pop is making money playing (quasi)blues. I wonder if the blues fans just turn away when clapton does a pop album? I have heard some say he is a subpar guitar player or derivative, or that the fact that he went to Berklee makes his playing somehow not valid. WELL,  <br />1. I am a Berklee grad (guitar performance), so I can say with authority he is good. I sat down and figured out some of his earlier stuff, the chord voicings are tricky in places, lots of weird extensions and odd inversions. His groove is definatly there. He only attended a year too. To say that he was taught makes him less valid is, I think, quite ignorant. Everyone learns from others, no one is an island. Hendrix learned from Little Richard and Wilson Pickett in the mid 60's Clapton from John Mayall and old Freddie King records Vai from Zappa etc. <br />2. Lets not forget that SRV's first record was panned by all the press, he was booed off the stage at Montroux. And all the critics hated Zeppelin and called them derivitave too. Just because some of the fans/critics dont get it at first dosent mean its not good, it just means it challanges the boundries of what people think of as valid. Besides no one shold ever listen to critics. Have opinions of your own, thats what your brain is for. <br />3. Many dont like his voice. Many people focus on a musicians vocal quality, as if the only valid music is someone singing. I read one review here, from a 20 year old Recording Engineer, who apparently REALLY LISTENS to music. She said this guy is total crap because he hasnt got a good singing voice. Well because of her age I will cut her some slack. However she should know that its not the timbre of ones voice, or his or her range or technical ability that makes a good vocalist - rather ones ability to work within those limitations to deliver the most heartfelt telling performance at every opportunity. The fact she said nothing about the somewhat poor quality of the remainder of the disks mix is also telling. Also her lack of comment to the ABSOLUTLY KILLER PERFORMANCE of Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino is telling. These guys  are both seasoned seasoned musicians with long lists of top notch sessions. She would be a lucky engineer if she ever got to work a session with either of these two.  <br />4. There are definatly problems with the mix, very muddy at times. Hence the 3 stars insead of 4

0446577383|1.0|I grabbed this book off the shelf as son as it came out. <br />I usually enjoy Baldaccis work, and couldn't wait to sit down for a good read. <br />What a serious dissapointment. <br />This book should have been listed under politics instead of fiction. What a hack job, cheap shot, bill board for the liberal perspective this \\"novel\\" was. <br />Besides, for Baldacci, it wasn't well writtn, or well plotted, nor were the characters developed. <br />It's a cheap novel, written for quick, cheap thrills, with no substance, and a complete lack of believability. <br />It reads like it was thrown together over a long week end. <br />This is the kind of book that tempts one to skip the entire middle section, just to see how the writer get's the heroes out of the final jam. The middle 250 pages of this book are boring, and seem to have been written just to get us to the inevitable, predictable, end. <br />It insulted my average intelligence.
0375701427|5.0|Unlike many other readers, I don't think this book is primarily about the 60's in general or the Vietnam War in particular.  Rather I think those are devices utilized to illustrate Roth's central theme of the book, namely that we can never really know another human being.  No matter how close we think we are to others, our differences (whehter, ethnic, religious, economic or generational) create a vast gulf between us.  Roth's striking proposition is that this gulf is just as wide between a father and daughter as it is between passing high school acquaintances.  The incredibly detailed accounting of \\"the Swede's\\" life is laced with irony, in that we really don't know if any of it is true at all or just the ramblings of an (envious?) author.  Perhaps the point is that we all create our own reality as we go along, and that the only way to rationally deal with others is to acknowledge that complete mutual understanding is impossible.  Either that, or I have no idea what the guy is talking about.
0060578793|5.0|Really a thorough guide; learned a lot about biological, geological and directional referencing. The ONLY way this book could be improved would be to include climatological and cultural aspects of needing to survive (but then, that'd have to become a different volume altogether). Takes the edge off of the worry while adventuring since it helps prepare you better for your next excursion.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This is great music. The Strokes have unquestionably evolved into some deeper thoughts and music here. The first 5 songs in my opinion set the stage for the album- they are the more catchy and memorable songs- but many of the ones after the fifth, if listened to carefully have very intricate songwriting and are deep (they can be interpreted many different ways). I like Ize of the World for one best captivating how it feels to live in the world in 2006: \\"a desk to organize a product to advertise, a market to monopolize, movie stars to idolize, leaders to scandalize, enemies to neutralize\\"- plus the way it ends is unlike I've ever heard before- the lyrics match w/ the timing. It sounds like Julian might want to think about quiting smoking-his voice sounds somewhat querky at times, but its still pretty nice to listen to.  Vision of Division is awesome w/ some crazy guitar playing. Heart in a Cage is also fast tempoed and well-written. The only problem I have w/ this album is that some of the beats sound a bit generic and too much computerized. Other than that- a very WELL written and advanced sound from the Strokes! A +.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|A Moment Lost is my all time favourite Enya, better than Orinico Flow or Wild Child. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM AND DONT REGRET IT. <br />IT IS A GEM!

0553801503|5.0|I've seen a number of one star reviews complaining of \\"bad editing\\".  Honestly, that's a ridiculous opinion. <br /> <br />As a stand alone novel, yes, AFFC doesn't go much of anywhere.  But it's not a stand alone novel.  As Book 4 of a 7 book series, it's excellent.  While this book does not expand much on a number of ASOIAF's running stories, statements others have made that since that doesn't happen, the outstanding text that was present should have been edited away is pure foolishness. <br /> <br />AFFC gives us a tremendous amount of background - and I think we're going to need it for the next three books.  Plus, it tells some really excellent small character stories. <br /> <br />If every book has huge, unexpected events, they stop being huge and unexpected.  Fans of the series who don't demand that every book \\"top\\" the last in terms of \\"big events\\" will discover that AFFC is an outstanding piece of the gorgeous tapestry that is ASOIAF. <br /> <br />Keep up the good work, GRRM.
B00005JOIF|4.0|Confounding expectations, Steven Spielberg has directed a relentlessly tense thriller based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and its aftermath that coalesces its often chilling, suspenseful elements into an almost \\"Godfather\\"-like family saga about the obligation of duty and the crisis of conscience. The epic 2005 film doesn't completely work, but the unpredictable nature of the film keeps the momentum going for most of its 162-minute running time. Spielberg, regardless, should be lauded for taking well-remembered historical events within their context and making them resonate in today's politically charged environment.<br /><br />Co-written by the estimable Tony Kushner (\\"Angels in America\\") and Eric Roth from George Jonas's fictionalized book \\"Vengeance\\", the movie opens with the familiar archived footage of ABC sports commentator Jim McKay reporting on the Black September terrorists kidnapping eleven Israeli athletes at Munich's Olympic village only to be gunned down hours later at the airport. The story then focuses on an undercover commando team instigated confidentially by Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir but officially disconnected from the Mossad, Israel's counterpart to the CIA. The motley group led by Avner Kaufman, Meir's former bodyguard and the son of a revered Israeli freedom fighter, is charged with finding the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the massacre and assassinating them one at a time. These are indeed acts of vengeance by a country who felt the need for respect as well as sympathy from a watchful global community, and the bulk of the movie is about how the team goes about with the killings.<br /><br />I have to admit that there is a sense of movie convention in the characters who make up the team - Robert, the guilt-sticken bomb expert; Steve, the sometime intolerably cocky driver; Hans, the ice-cold documents forger; and Carl, the anxious \\"clean-up\\" man who by default, becomes the conscience of the group. However, the actors inhabiting the parts are all quite strong within these constraints, and there is particular standout work by Daniel Craig as Steve (he seems well poised to play James Bond in the roughhewn Connery manner) and Ciar&aacute;n Hands as Carl. Alternating fluidly between coolly calculated actions and percolating indecisiveness and using his skills in the kitchen as a cathartic release, Eric Bana brings a soulful and increasingly haunting quality to Avner, the designated leader who somehow retains sympathy for his character while going about the business of killing. At times, he seems like an emotional cipher, but I think that helps in the story flow. And in fact, the complexities behind the politically motivated murders, which take place in a variety of exotic locations, are what drive the sometimes convoluted plotline.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush does a convincing Israeli accent as Avner's by-the-book Mossad contact, Ephraim, and Lynn Cohen - yes, Miranda's Eastern European maid, Magda, on \\"Sex in the City\\" - has a few effective moments at the beginning as the conflicted Meir. The movie, however, is not without its share of flaws. First, there is the red-herring use of a French contact with a father who is apparently legendary in the field of political intrigue and information peddling. While Mathieu Amalric and especially Michael Lonsdale give fine performances as Avner's contact, Louis, and his worldly father, their characters feel more like plot devices from another spy thriller entirely, especially as they expose their dysfunctional family set-up over lunch at a chateau to which Avner must be taken blindfolded. There is also a beautiful woman of mystery at a bar, which actually feels like it was cribbed from a similar scene in, of all movies, \\"The Sting\\".  There is another flaw in the extended coda where I feel Spielberg misjudges the emotional parallels in the rather contrived cross-cutting between the athletes' killings and a bed scene between Avner and his wife.<br /><br/>Nonetheless, Spielberg is a master when it comes to the set-up of the action sequences, whether it's a plan that goes awry with a child returning unexpectedly home or a shooting spree near the docks of Beirut or the killing of a Palestinian passionate about his inextricable need for a homeland. Naturally, the post-9/11 atmosphere lends particular resonance to all these scenes, though credit Spielberg for not making an overtly political statement along these lines. As always, the craftsmanship behind the production is first-rate, in particular, Janusz Kaminski's dramatically lit cinematography and Michael Kahn's blistering editing. Make no mistake that Spielberg has most definitely made a morality picture about the unending cycle of violence in the Middle East and at the end of it, really doesn't take sides on the issue. Certainly the volatility of the topic has prevented a strong film from Hollywood...at least until Spielberg was willing to helm this one. Kudos for that move.br />Nonetheless, Spielberg is a master when it comes to the set-up of the action sequences, whether it's a plan that goes awry with a child returning unexpectedly home or a shooting spree near the docks of Beirut or the killing of a Palestinian passionate about his inextricable need for a homeland.

B0006Q1ULQ|1.0|I tried to read this book.  I really tried.  I got it on sale because I'd heard of the author and was curious.  This is the first book in my memory that I have put aside because I hated every sentence in it.  Normally I struggle through the first part of a \\"boring\\" book and become pleasantly surprised by the end.  I just couldn't get past the first fifty pages, and not without lack of effort.  The sad part is that I wanted to like this book and made an honest effort to, but the author made that impossible for me.  My advice is don't read this one - there are better books out there.  Who knows, in a few years I may even be willing to try one of Eco's earlier works.  Then again, I hate this book so much that I doubt I'll even be willing to concede to that.  If you like \\"historical\\" fiction, try Carter Beats the Devil or the Venus Throw, which are a lot more fun to read.

When they are updated with the information, the new release date will be posted.

I have no idea. Just a guess :)
B00007K02F|1.0|I saw this version of Jane Eyre after watching the A&E version (having discovered both versions at our public library).  This version was very disappointing to say the least.    There was absolutely no \\"passion\\" between Jane and Rochester.  Jane showed no emotion and lacked personality.  The dialogue was delivered without any real feeling or emotion behind it.  As much as I love the book, I was bored with this movie.  I always imagined Jane, despite her Lowood schooling, to have a little fire inside her--able to handle Mr Rochester in his anger and not afraid to tease him a little.  This Jane seemed so melancholy and lacked any spirit.       Although I don't mind changes to a story in general, I found the changes in this story annoying since huge chunks of the book were rewritten:  return to Gateshead, St John and only one sister who take on a completely different role than what was written in the book, Thornfield burning....    If you are looking for a story with more accuracy to the book, I suggest the 1984(?)Timothy Dalton version.  It is a longer version and therefore includes much more of the original story.  Much of the dialogue comes straight from the book.  It is a bit dated and I feel like I'm watching a play rather than a movie, but it is still very good.  The A&E version with Hinds/Morton also makes many changes in the story but at least the characters show some \\"passion\\".  Neither of these versions of Jane Eyre are perfect but they are far more enjoyable to watch than this version.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is a testament to the passionate efforts of the Firefly fanbase.  After the cancelation of the show, Firefly fans rallied and gave Joss Whedon the support he needed to get Universal to make \\"Serenity\\".  Joss Whedon did not dissapoint his fans.  \\"Serenity\\" is a show full of good action, good dialogue, and even good laughs.  One does not need to be familiar with the television series to enjoy this movie, as Joss Whedon explains all you need to know in the course of the film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The cancellation of Firefly is one of the great crimes against television committed in the last 5 years.  You may be wondering why you would want to consider watching a television show that didn't even last a full season.  The answer is simple.  You don't want to miss out.  This show is smart, funny, exciting, and even thought provoking.  Why didn't it make it then?  Because people didn't give it a fair chance.  Fox put it on Fridays, and that was just a hugely unfair thing for both the television watching public and the show.  Despite this obstacle, Firefly instantly created a hugely fanatic following that worked hard to get the show put back on television.  In 2005 they got their reward with the release of the movie \\"Serenity\\", and it was one of the best reviewed movies of that year.  Watch this show and discover why people are so passionate about it.

B00003CXC6|4.0|To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the \\"Best Foreign Film\\" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle.  Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar.  In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest.  Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it.  Rashômon is a rare breed of film.  The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being \\"borrowed\\".  His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.<br /><br />While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashômon.  This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical \\"courthouse\\" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth.  At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashômon.  Kurosawa gives us the \\"black sheep\\" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story.  As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end.  What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film.  Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true \\"truth\\".  Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the \\"truth\\" may never be known.  Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that \\"it didn't exist\\".  Deep within Rashômon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended.  A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story.  This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.<br /><br />Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashômon is a flawless film.  From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor.  To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history.  In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time.  He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time.  While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute.  When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved.  Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife.  While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease.  When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that this wasa near perfect film.  Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories.  I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied.  My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it.  I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes.  I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end.  The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path.  It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all!<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****a near perfect film.  Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories.

B000267JQK|4.0|Disclaimer II is Seether's American deubt with 8 additional tracks added on (one of which is the remake of Broken featuring Amy Lee). You can complain all you want about Seether's underhanded marketing (rereleasing a previous album with a few new tracks instead of making a new album), but this is still a very solid album. <br /> <br />There are a number of excellent tracks on this album, including Fine Again, Take Me Away, Needles, Gasoline, Fade Away and 69 Tea. There are also a couple really awful tracks, namely Pig and F*ck It. <br /> <br />The original 12 song album was quite good and the additions to the album help somewhat. However of the eight new songs, there are only two standouts (Take Me Away and the duet version of Broken). The new songs sound just like the old songs, which is one of Seether's biggest problems. Shaun's voice always sounds the same, unless he's screaming, which is usually a bad thing anyway. <br /> <br />The lyrics are fairly good, and Shaun sings reasonably well, but the best part of Seether's Disclaimer II is the guitar playing with is very stellar. <br /> <br />I recommend this album for anyone looking for a solid rock album, but dont expect anything tremendous. There are some tremendous tracks, and some very bad ones. So take this album for whats its worth. <br /> <br />If you already own Disclaimer, I wouldnt recommend buying Disclaimer II... the music videos are alright, but not great. The new songs are decent, but they arent worth another twenty bucks. Just get Karma and Effect if you're looking for another Seether album and already have Disclaimer.
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|What can I saw about this bad album that hasnt already been said? <br /> <br />Not much. The first half of the album sounds like they actually have some direction. 'Juicebox', 'Razorblade', 'On The Other Side' are fun tracks, but oh my, so many of these songs are boring! I swear I had to change from song to song every 2 minutes because it was causing the food in my stomach to turn. <br /> <br />Julian's lazy singing is so irritating. I loved it on the first two albums because of the way it effortlessly passed through the fuzzbox while the guys in the back coordinated their riffs, but it seems on this one that he's completely oblivious to what the rest of the band is doing.  <br /> <br />They aren't Television. If you're sick of hearing that comparison, fine. Screw it. Go get their albums (Marquee Moon and Adventure) and see for yourself. Television is leaps above The Strokes. I bought a ticket to see The Strokes live in Dublin and now I feel cheated. I think I'll return it if that's possible.
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|Robots is a great movie for the family to watch all together. The whole concept of talking robots and the animation was something to watch. Knowing the director and the producer, it is amazing to see how well this movie was put together. The plot was really suitable for children. The characters are funny, which is the whole idea of this movie. The story goes like this... <br /> <br />This robot named Rodney Copperbottom has grown up not as the richest family. His parts are hand-me-downs, and his father is a dishwasher working at a restaraunt. Rodney has had an inspiration for many of his childhood years until after he finishes college. His inspiration is a fat inventor called Bigweld. He invents things to make things better. The big thing that he makes is spare parts so people can fix themselves. So, for many years of his childhood, he works on an invention called wonderbot. It helps his father with the dishes because his father \\"has to take work home with him,\\" because he didn't have any extra time. After college, he finishes his invention, but it gets nervous under pressure. So, wonderbot messes up with the dishes at father's job. So, Rodney wants to got to Robot City, where Mr. Bigweld lives and show wonderbot to him. He ends up going and gets into a little trouble at first. He finds out that Bigweld isn't there and this guy named Rachet, has taken over. Next what happens is that he meets new friends that are broke. Then, the whole group goes to find an extra part for his friend. They find out that he is outmoded. They are no longer making spare parts. They are making upgrades that are worth a lot of money. Mr. Bigweld was about saying, \\"You can make anything no matter what you are made of,\\" but Rachet is all about making money. He finds out that Bigweld hasn't been there for 2 years and then he started to look for him. He ended up meeting a girl that works with Rachet named Cappy (Halle Barry). She never really liked Rachet and started to help Rodney. They foundhis place, and then they found out that Bigweld had just given up. They didn't know what to do afterwards. I will not give the ending. <br /> <br />This movie is an inspiration to all children and everyone will love this. Buy this please if you are looking for this movie.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Sadism, as the release of *Hostel* suggests, is the order of the day.    We need not, however, even examine, really, how or to what extent this film will offend middle-class sensibility; the individual as moral agent is a subject that had some time ago receded from serious consideration, dispatched thither by that many-tentacled monster our culture has become, in which, astonishingly, torture receives sententious treatment in popular media as a viable means of interrogation.  In this era of absent absolutes, all human activity becomes equally meritorious because precisely none is--at least, that is, from the point of view of any reliable moral calculus.  To judge one (negatively) is to oppress him usurpatiously, without license, because no one enjoys that God's-eye view where all contigent situational skirmishes resolve into a more comprehensively scrutable context.    No, I will not natter on about bourgeois morality and the assault from all quarters that it constantly suffers; to point this out is to say nothing new.    The arrival of *Hostel,* which I'm sure will, like the blood-laced pabulum it is, be lapped up with glee  by the same Adderall-addled first-person-shooter-shooters whom it has been my tremendous misfortune to (attempt to) teach, is infelicitous for another reason: it contributes, at a time in which it has never been more dangerous to do so, to the inevitable desensitizing to sadistic brutality which occurs with every film and video game of this genre, where violence, if not represented in a humorous vein (See: just about every Quentin Tarantino film.  Incidentally, Tarantino, like some infernal latter-day P. T. Barnum, grants his imprimatur to *Hostel*), is represented simply for its own sake--some clinical curiosity, epiphenomenal with drawing air in a human form, and nothing more.    Indeed, I have seen an earlier version of this film.  It then bore the title, *The Abu Ghraib Prison Scandal.*    The parallels of the story of *Hostel,* in which some American dunderheads embark on an ill-fated tour of hedonism in a former Soviet satellite state, to contemporary events are uncanny enough to make one wax conspiratorial.  I need only cite \\"extraordinary rendition\\": diffuse weaselese for the surreptitous flouting of the protections of the Geneva Convention.  To be extraordinarily rendered is, as I understand it, to be whisked away to some former Soviet satellite state in order to be interrogated clandestinely in a place where the Geneva Convention has about as much real moral traction as *Poor Richard's Almanac* has for the typical American today.    Makes you think, don't it?    While I am certainly open to arguments to the contrary, it is my conviction that, in foisting this squalid little piece of snuff on a (let's admit it) rather ignorant, impressionable, sycophantic mass audience, Quentin Tarantino and *Hostel* writer-director Eli Roth stand guilty of acting with a degree of social and political irresponsibility that, given the current climate of dirty war for dubious aims, can only be considered destructively un-American.  They have cynically cashed in on what I do not doubt will be perceived in the future as a sad epoch of American cultural history in order be the on the vangard of a sordid recrudescence of grand-guignol.  They have seen to it that, when torture becomes art, art becomes torture.    ...And decadent art, which *Hostel,* Artaudian in its pretensions but lacking the requisite intelligence, most certainly is, has historically been a sure symptom of an empire in collapse.    So enjoy your blood and circuses, unlettered plebes.  Ignore the heat, and ignore that sound in the distance; it's only Nero tuning his violin.
B0009X7664|5.0|The racism `s argument monopolized the whole attention, specially in the Sixties. To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme; among the most important we should name Defiant ones and The edge of city in the Fifties.<br /><br />But undoubtedly, the four most important thematic cycles  had reached its task in the movie industry: The Noir Film, The Science Fiction, The War memories and the lightweight comedies (Wilder, Hawks); an important and relatively recent current had born in the world: The French New Wave and the strong transcendence of the Italian Neo Realism permeated the vision of most of screen writers obligating them to make a true inward gaze in the deepest regions of the American social body. If there would be another weight reason to confirm this statement, examine carefully the work of Alfred Hitchcock from \\"To catch a thief\\" until \\"Marnie\\". You may realize how every one of the included pictures included these two concern about a dislocated state of mind, and the suspense is generated in the hidden caverns of the unconscious.<br /><br />In this sense this film had to shock the conscience of many viewers at that moment, when a small town layer assumes the hazardous task to defend a black man accused of rape. The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.<br /><br />The bitter taste you experience even several elapsed weeks and months don 't leave any shadow of doubt about the grandness of this bold film that inspired future films in that decade, such as Patch of Blue, To Sir with love, Guess who is coming to dinner, In the heat of the night (it' s not a mere casualty all of them starred by Poitier) and nourished the inspired of another independent filmmakers such as Samuel Fuller with two somber and terrible films (Shock corridor and The naked kiss). Of course, there would be a striking picture as \\"The chase\\", but this speech would be out of context.<br /><br />Go for this little gem that portraits the thundering reality of the early Sixties.e, there would be a striking picture as \\"The chase\\", but this speech would be out of context. <br /> <br />Go for this little gem that portraits the thundering reality of the early Sixties.             <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|How do you follow up a fantastic Debut album? Well, how about with a kick butt, super-produced, over the top 2nd!!! On first listen picked out 4 tracks that I loved instantly. Upon further listen, I picked out favorite parts in other songs, marveling at the brilliant production and usage of the Darkness' talents. Now I can't seem to stop playing the whole thing, over and over and over and over and over...
0099713217|3.0|This is a simple story and would suit 4-8 year olds. It is picture book, the text is limited on each page but it is not easy to read, the font used is sans serif and it is a slim type so it is not easy for early readers.  <br /> <br />This is obviously meant to be an attempt to ingloriously represent the Queen, fine by me, but I just don't think it is done well. It has its funny moments, the knickers decorated with real holly, the jewel encrusted knickers, but it falls short of being genuinely funny by trying to be too clever. <br /> <br />I didn't like the illustrations much, they are too naive and child-like. I love Helen Oxenbury style illustrations, or Maurice Sendak - those rich full pictures. The whole book feels thin and slightly inadequate. <br /> <br />Its not that bad, but its just not that good either.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was talking to a friend who works in the media industry, and he has heard mutterings that PULSE might be released in HD on Blueray disc.  It makes sense seeing that Sony is putting this film out.  If so, it would be one hell of a release.  Has anyone else heard this rumour?
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I have not yet seen the film, but if the music is any reflection, this film will haunt me after I do. The music is spare, elegant and clear. The list of artists who perform here are a select group of country masters. Should be remebered at Oscar time, both for the score and Best Song-either Willie Nelson's or Emmy Lou Harris' songs could be the winner. If you enjoyed this music don't miss the composer's other recent score \\"The Motorcycle Diaries,\\" another affecting soundtrack that seemlessly matches another superb film.<br /><br />Highly reommended.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is one of the best rappers ever. And he keeps making quality and meaningful rap music. 'Illmatic' is Nas'best album. There is nothing stopping 'Illmatic' from getting 5 stars. A lot of reviewers give 5 stars away like wind but most albums don't even come close to 'illmatic'. All 9 songs on this album are timeless. Nas has an incredible flow and the production by the likes of DJ Premier is equally astounding. My favourite tracks include 'NY STATE OF MIND', 'HALFTIME', 'ONE LOVE' and 'REPRESENT'. <br /> <br />Beats/production = 5/5 <br />Lyrics/delivery = 4.5/5 <br />Depth/message = 4.5/5 <br />Importance to rap genre =5/5 <br /> <br />'Illmatic' is a true classic and it will remain on my playlist in 2010. If you love rap music you will BUY this cd. If you prefer 50 cent's 'Get rich or try lying' I feel sorry 4 you
B0007GADZO|3.0|This album has some good points.  Building the Church and K'm Pee Du Wee are my favorites.  Firewall is an ok vocal song, but this album has some crappy stuff too.  Dying For Your Love plain out sucks.  Gai Gai is lame as well.  Some of Steve's choices on solos make no musical sense, even for Vai's standards, and are full of emotionless wanking.  I love Steve Vai, and have pretty much all his stuff.  He needs to experiment less, and give us his good stuff.  It seems to me that not much effort was put into this one.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I've never heard of any of the other bands that these guys are supposedly ripping off, so all I heard was exciting, original pop music. I don't know how this could be considered unoriginal. <br /> <br />I managed music stores in the 90s, and this made me wished I still did. This is the kind of CD you put on and bet how many you can sell. (Yes, music store employees really do that, and long before High Fidelity came out). <br /> <br />The last time I was this excited about a new band was Bicycle. They vanished...hopefully Panic! will stick around a while.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|I saw this tonight.  It is an ok movie.  Acting and special effects are good, but it is way too predictable.  This ruins the whole effect for me.  Also there are quite a few cliches.  Also there are a few eureka moments that could only happen in the movies.  For example, in one part, a soccer ball happens to get away from Steve Zahn's character.  He follows it down some steps into a darkened cave and just happens to see across the cave a small mural with a tiny (and I mean tiny) representation of the ship they are trying to find.  They discover it is a map. This leads them to determine a lot of stuff relevant to the movie.  I mean, what are the chances that any of that would happen in real life?  Naturally this is the movies, but a little realism would have been appreciated.  There are a lot of things like this, including the finale.<br />The other issue that I have is that fully half of the movie seems to be an environmental message.  The other half is an adventure.  They don't seem to be too well tied together.<br /><br />So, the good stuff:  Gorgeous environments are one reason to rent this movie.  Or buy it off Amazon, of course.  The other is the actors.  Zahn steals every scene, in my opinion.  The others did a fine job too.  The fight scenes are well done too.  So, 2.5 stars.  Worth checking out, as long as you are willing to suspend belief for two hours.
0060763280|4.0|I bought this book from a used bookseller. I didn't read much of it before buying. I just thought it looked like a good get-rich book.  <br /> <br />I am glad that I bought the book. This book takes a more inner look at why some people are rich and others are poor.  <br /> <br />The book explores how some people are pre-programmed for acquiring wealth and others are pre-programmed to lose all their money, or at least only make a certain amount of money.  <br /> <br />Upon first look the topics and procedures in the book sound a bit silly; however this book is not about being serious. It's about being a millionaire. One of the techniques I'm learned from the book I learn every time I find money on the ground, or receive money in any other form I say out loud \\"Yes! I am a MONEY MAGNET!\\". Certainly, it seems very silly, however I am noticing a gradual increase in the amount of money that I receive, not to mention finding money on the ground almost every day. I also practice another technique based on an old saying which I will paraphrase  <br /> <br />\\"Bless those who you admire. Bless that which you desire,\\"  <br /> <br />So what I've been doing is blessing nice cars, banks and their members' bank accounts, and nice places I want to eventually live. I don't know if this technique works, however it feels good.  <br /> <br />One way the book helps you along is with positive affirmations and beliefs that also can be used to help other parts of your life. There are many declarations you can say to enforce your millionaire mind, as well as quotes that help you out.  <br /> <br />\\"If you're having big problems, it only means you're being a small person\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Complaining only turns you into a walking crap-magnet\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Rich people play to win. Poor people play to not lose\\"  <br /> <br />I must say that this book has helped immensely, as my net worth and bank account have certainly improved. The roller-coaster of my attitude has stopped going up and down, and pretty much remains at a constant high. However, this also could be due to the fact that I'm a Buddhist. I try my best to not complain about anything, and maintain a belief that I have good fortune; and I feel that my life is getting better.  <br /> <br />Some parts of the book for ideas are not explained enough. For example, Eker mentions network marketing, yet does not go into detail explaining what network marketing is.  <br /> <br />Some extras the book includes are:  <br /> <br />+ Declarations you can print out from the website  <br />+ An invitation to a free Millionaire Mind Seminar (valued at $2000)  <br />+ Several other tidbits for helping you along in your path to fortune  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book for reading several times over. Don't worry about how bizarre and silly the book may be. Just focus on your goal of financial freedom.
0307276902|5.0|I found this book to be not only terrifying, but also awe-inspiring.  There was not a minute in the short period that it took me to read this book that I was not agonizing about the pain James Frey was enduring.  I bought this book on a Thursday morning and was finished by Saturday afternoon.  Upon finishing it, I had to learn more and began researching the author and his life upon leaving rehab.  This book gives great insight into the world of a drug addict and gives a wonderful look at the pain that causes one to be just that.  I look forward to reading more from Frey, and especially look forward to reading the sequel to Pieces, My Friend Leonard. <br /> <br />I have a hard time understanding how anyone could be outraged at Frey or his book as one of the other reviews states.  This man was in such pain and took the time to share it with others so they could either help addicts they now or even help themselves.  I don't believe he is laughing all the way to the bank as he is still, 13 years after leaving the clinic, struggling to remain sober.  This was a beautiful story of a man learning to deal with his inner demons and find his own path instead of taking the path handed to him. <br /> <br />In rebuttal to the review left by David Blair, this book never claims to be written WHILE the author is going through his withdrawal, but rather is written ABOUT his time of withdrawal and rehab.  Frey does an excellant job of making the reader feel as though they are there feeling it with him.  In response to Mr. Blair's question of when was the book actually written, with a little research that answer is easily found.  Frey started the book in 1996, 2 years after leaving the treatment center.  The book was not finished until mid-2001. <br /> <br />

1932907009|5.0|Kudos to Blake Snyder for Save The Cat!  This could be the ultimate how-to book on screenwriting for Hollywood.  Snyder strips away the mystique of writing a script, providing an invaluable tool for beginning and professional screenwriters alike. <br /> <br />In a breezy and straight-forward style, Save The Cat! lays out the elements of story structure, character, dramatic beats, genre and theme, and how these come together to create a winning screenplay.  A successful Hollywood screenwriter, Snyder presents \\"golden rules\\"  that are key to both the craft of screenwriting, and the industry.  If you're writing a script you hope to sell, Cat is a must-read! <br /> <br />As a professional screenwriter and teacher in New York, I have been recommending Save The Cat! to all my students...and the consensus is in: this is the book to have!
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom is one of my all-time favorite books.  I have read it many times and each time I do, I discover new nuggets of knowledge, insight and wisdom.  The relationship between Mitch and Morrie is heart warming and tender.  I love the fact that Mitch is so open and honest with where he was at the beginning of the story and how his life changed as he spent those precious Tuesdays with his dear friend.  As I read the book, I found myself looking into the hearts and lives of two real people trying to make a difference and contribute to each other and us - as a whole.  What a beautiful journey they shared.  I'm so glad that their Tuesdays will last forever!

Other than that, no complaints about this compilation of fantastic, cutting-edge pop classics.  The two new tracks \\"I've Got A Life\\" and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" only show how time has strengthened Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox's somgwriting prowess.  Buy this CD and check out all their remastered album CDs as well, all containing exclusive bonus tracks.
0596009208|5.0|I read a good share of the reviews, and all of the bad ones before buying this book and gave it a shot anyway.  There are *tons* of good reviews here, describing the book in detail - for the most part, it's a good book for beginners and intermediate programmers that are just new to Java.   <br /> <br />That being said, I felt it necessary to include one *VITAL* piece of errata; this is why anyone would have a hard time making it through the first steps of getting what author is trying to show you to work: <br /> <br />The first example is missing a classpath that is required on most Windows machines: <br />They use: java MyApp <br />You may need: java -cp . MyApp <br /> <br />The classpath is where to look for paths, and a period means \\"this directory\\".  For some reason, they didn't explain that in the book (along with the fact that you may need to call the full path for java: c:\progra~1\Java\ etc.). <br /> <br />Learning Java is a great undertaking as it is a very in-depth language, but this book definitely deserves a read-through if you're just starting out in the language. <br />
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I seriously haven't heard a new cd this good in a long, long, long time. The songs are a departure from a lot of The Strokes' previous music. Don't let \\"Juicebox\\" fool you. It sounds closest to their earlier stuff, but this new album truly is something special. Whenever I put it in, I have to listen to track one, \\"You Only Live Once\\" at least 3 or 4 times before I can move on. Easily their best song, \\"You Only Live Once\\" is such an upbeat, feel-good song along the lines of Kings of Leon's \\"The Bucket\\". This album definately finds The Strokes employing a richer, more mature sound. First Impressions of Earth is definately The Strokes best effort yet. I am certain this will be on many 'Best Of' lists for 2006.

B00001U0DP|1.0|Anyone who has actually studied Holocaust history would be appalled by this flippant, impoverished, and manipulative film. Those of you singing its praises would do well to read \\"Masters of Death: the SS Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust\\" by Richard Rhodes or \\"The Nazi Doctors\\" by Robert Jay Lifton--both of which accurately and devastatingly depict camp conditions, torture, and mass executions. There are no jokes to be mined from this history.  To find humor in it would require revision if not denial of the truth--which is what \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is all about. Doubtless, not a single champion of this film is a Holocaust survivor nor a serious reader of history.

So many of the tracks at first seem relatively simple, but everything is SO well placed.  Her lyrics are perfectly suited to every track.  Its an almost even balance of rather industrial tracks(OH YEAH!) and more melodic songs, a few with almost no percussion.  I recommend this record to everyone.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the typical sad-sack, luckless loser that has permeated high schools for seemingly centuries. He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.<br /><br />Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.<br /><br />Napoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.<br /><br />Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: \\"What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!\\" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.<br /><br />I think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life.a do.....GOSH!\\" Still, his delivery is perfect.

Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it.<br /><br />This movie is completely amazing. Totally original story and wonderful directing. Some of the best directing that i've seen in any movie. Some of the best original music too. This is in my top five favorites, and it also boosted Jim Carrey into one of my favorite actors. You know you have a good movie on your hands when the next day you're still thinking about parts of it, and you want to see those parts again. If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you check it out. It's different, in a really good way. There's not much more to tell you about it. If you want to see the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, than you should absolutely skip this one. But if you want to see a side of him and Kate Winslet that you've never seen, or if you want to see a total original movie with wonderful cinematography and really great music, then by all means, you should absolutely see this one!
068987474X|5.0|I bought this book along with Barbara Rose's \\"Stop being the string along\\" and I don't know how Amazon pairs books, but these two should be paired! <br /> <br />Greg tells the not into you signs, and they are right on the mark.  When he's not making a commitment after a couple of years, and you're crying yourself to sleep at night because he's not showing you how much he IS into you, then this is a great book to read.  <br /> <br />Just a note to \\"Broken\\" below. If you love her that much, and you ARE into her, get her whatever kind of ring you can afford, and pop the question! If a guy loves a woman, he shows it! When he's not showing it, or is too scared to show it, what's a woman supposed to do, just keep wondering and hoping? Tell her you love you her, Broken! Then it'll all be fixed!  <br />
1400032717|5.0|If you're looking to read a nail-biting  murder mystery, I suggest you pick up another book - you won't find  too much suspense in this one. You will, however, find a short and easy  read that provides a fascinating account of an extraordinary young boy  living in Swindon, England. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the  Night-Time will touch your heart, and, like the murder mystery you  may be looking for, will make you never want to put it down.  <br /> <br />At exactly seven minutes after midnight,  Christopher John Francis Boone finds his neighbor's poodle Wellington,  lying motionless on her front lawn. The dog, however warm, is dead,  with a garden pitchfork sticking out of its side. This isn't a pleasant  sight for Christopher, who is later falsely accused of the murder. However,  the fact that the canine has clearly been a victim of a terrible crime  does not seem to scare him, nor does being arrested for assaulting the  police officer who interrogates him about the dog.  <br /> <br />\\"The policeman took hold of my arm  and lifted me onto my feet. I didn't like him touching me like this.  And this is when I hit him\\" (8). What's wrong with the policeman lifting  him up to his feet, you could ask? Well, let's begin by saying that  Christopher is not like every other boy his age. He is a special boy.  Christopher is a boy who absolutely hates being touched, groans  when \\"there is too much information coming into his head from the outside  world\\" (7), refuses to eat anything yellow, and \\"knows all the countries  of the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057\\"  (2). Christopher John Francis Boone, with all of these delightful quirks,  is autistic. <br /> <br />The case of the dead dog in the garden  inspires Christopher to write a \\"murder mystery\\" novel, an ambitious  task for a 15-year-old boy. Nonetheless, he begins his book with the  account of the dead dog, and continues to write long after the dog's  murder. He writes, not so much about Wellington, but about his day-to-day  life in the late 90s, living with a single father in a small house on  Randolph Street. Little does Christopher know that the suspicious death  of his neighbor's poodle has great significance to his life, and embarking  on an investigation into the murder provides greater insights on the  many secrets behind his broken family. <br /> <br />The Curious Incident of the Dog  in the Night-Time is the remarkable story of Christopher Boone,  brought to justice by the pen of Mark Haddon, a creative writing teacher  from Oxford, England. Haddon's work with mentally challenged children  in his youth is made apparent by the style of the writing, as the novel,  with its conversational sentences and uncomplicated vocabulary, reads  like it could actually have been written by a 15-year-old autistic boy.  <br /> <br />Despite Christopher's claims that  his book \\"will not be a funny book\\" (8), as he does not understand  jokes, there is a subtle humor in the story, which reflects the wit  and originality in the writing. The detailed illustrations that Christopher  puts in every other chapter also contribute to the color and the unique  quality of the book. Along with the pictures, there are numerous math  problems scattered throughout the novel, and while the solutions to  these are long-winded and tedious to read, a few of them, such as the Monty Hall Problem, are interesting, and add a touch of flavor to  the story and to Christopher's character.  <br /> <br />Haddon, a first-time novelist, touches  different themes with his debut novel, including the importance of family  and honesty. At the beginning of the book, the relationship between  Christopher and his father seems to be a rather healthy one, given the  circumstances of Christopher's condition. However, as Christopher begins  to realize that his father may not have been completely honest with  him at times, the bond between them quickly begins to dwindle. The family  aspect of Christopher's life proves to be extremely significant to  him, and the lack of communication between him and his father causes  him much distress and confusion. The recurring theme of family in this  novel consistently reminds us of the importance of trust and constant  communication between loved ones in everyday life.  <br /> <br />Calling to mind the would-be challenging  narration of a mentally challenged individual's everyday life, Haddon  skillfully manages to author the story with both a profound maturity  and an eccentric imagination, drawing us in with every word. The short,  almost childlike, direct sentences he uses resonate both simplicity  and meaning, inviting readers to read between the lines and beyond the  surface of the text, while displaying the surprising depth and complexity  of Christopher's thought. This distinct and exceptional style of writing  helps us to more easily relate to a person we would regularly not be  able to, such as Christopher Boone. The creative and intelligent approach  Haddon uses to effectively put us into an autistic boy's shoes deserves  nothing less than a standing ovation.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband because he is a huge horror fan and a John Carpenter fan.  I'm not a fan of widescreen but I read one of the previous reviews that this edition came with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other.  This is not the case.  I bought this special edition and it does not contain the full screen version at all. I was slightly disappointed in that feature only.   <br /> <br />This special edition version showed many angles of the camera not seen in the regular version that originally was aired.  It was a great view of the film.  Adrienne Barbeau was excellent in this movie.  I highly recommend to anyone to buy this film even if you're not a horror fan, you won't be disappointed!! <br />
B0007O38XU|5.0|I've \\"Spaceballs\\" at least 50 times, and I never get tired of it. Truly Mel Brooks' last great film (has he even made any since?), this uproarious sci fi spoof is a laugh a minute riot that everyone will love.<br /><br />The plot goes something like this. The evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and the sleazy President Skroob (Brooks) have planned to save their home planet Spaceball. How? They'll kidnapped Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga, who went on to do \\"Melrose Place\\"), daughter of King Roland (Dick Van Patten) of the peace loving Planet Druidia, and will hold her for ransom. Instead of money, they want to drain the air from Druidia and transport it to their planet. However, instead of giving in to their demands, King Roland enlists the help of galaxy warrior Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and his faithful sidekick Barf (the late, great John Candy) to save her. What ensues is a spoof of various sci films such as \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Alien\\" and \\"Star Trek\\". Along the way, our heroes pay a visit to the all knowing Yogurt (Brooks) and encouter great peril.<br /><br />This film is a truly hilarious. Now, it has been released in special two disc deluxe edition form. This is a film that belongs in your dvd collection.
0553801503|5.0|I actually put off reading this book for a few weeks because of the \\"bad press\\" it seems to have generated on Amazon.    What a mistake.  It's a great book.  The Sansa, Arya, Samwell, Cerci, and Jamie chapters are exceptional.    The new characters (in Dorne and the Iron Islands) were a little slow for me, at first, because they're only tangentially realated to the plot-lines I already knew and loved.  But, that quickly changed.  By the end, I was deeply engaged.    I remember feeling the same way about Dany.  C'mon, George, why are you talking about this whole other world when the one with the Stark's is so perfect?  Of course, like many other readers, Dany has become one of my favorites (if not my favorite).    I had the misfortune of reading A Game of Thrones as my first fantasy novel (outside of the Rings years before).  Over the last couple years, I've scoured the bookscape looking for anything approaching the quality Feast delivers, reading literally 50+ fantasy/sci-fi books, from Hobb to Salvatore to Wolfe, and have come up short -- only Gene Wolfe's New Sun is comparable, in my opinion, and that's not probably not fantasy -- certainly not high fantasy.    So, is this as good as the first 3?  No, I'll conceed that.  But, what a bar!  It's really a shame to see all these 1-star rating for Feast with the same tripe about GRRM Jordanizing his series.      What a bunch of baloney.  I suffered through Jordan's series and the difference in quality is mindblowing.  For one thing, by book 9 of Wheel, 40% of Jordan's novels were re-tellings of the previous ones (like, cut & paste).  Jordan's characters were stagnant, so hearing in-depth descriptions of their thoughts, opinions, and clothing become incredibly tedious -- we'd *heard* about the same thoughts and clothing n-times before.    In Feast, all the characters have evolved -- some growing darker, some more mature, some insane, some more brave, some more honorable, some less honorable, many more dangerous...And GRRM doesn't waste a single page on boring, cut&paste re-tellings.  If anything, I probably missed some things because it's been a year since reading Storm.    All in all, particularly for readers new to GRRM, my advice is to not believe these nonsensical 1 & 2 star reviews, nor the low average score.  Most important, for your own good, do not pass this series by because of them!    I suspect people are giving this low marks *relative* to the other books in this series.  But, this book is orders of magnitude better than your typical 1-2 star fantasy novel.
6305922756|5.0|A lot people have told me to watch \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\". And I really wanted to. Last night, I finally got around to watching this so called \\"funniest movie ever made about rock and roll\\" (as the back cover states proudly). And I watched I had seen it sooner.<br /><br />This, is bar none, one of the funniest movies ever made. In this so called \\"rockumentary\\", renowned commercial director Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) chronicles the history of the legendary heavy metal band Spinal Tap, headed up by lead guitarist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and lead bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), along with various ill fated drummers. Through interviews, backstage footage and lots of music, such as big Tap hits like \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Sex Farm\\", you will learn everything you need to know about this great classic rock band.<br /><br />This brand new special edition is loaded with great bonus features, none of which I watched yet. (It'll be a while before I get a chance, because I got a lot of Christmas gifts). But the most special feature of them all is the movie itself.

B0000797IO|2.0|Something just isn't right about this film; I think it's the dissonant way the film combines lightness and humor with drama and tragedy. The film seems to expect us to take the characters and the story seriously at the same time it does not.   <br /> <br /> <br />
1860498825|5.0|I bought this book in the airport and was unable to put it down for the next week.  It was beautifully done with just enough descriptions to allow the reader to use his/her imagination and complete the picture.  I loved the different points of view from the two main characters: Maud and Susan.  It helped to allow the reader to delve into the hearts of both of these two women while consistantly being surprised at what there is to find.  I loved the dramatic irony that seems sprinkled throughout the book.  The reader constantly thinks that they know something that one of the character's does not.  I found myself constantly taking sides for and against the two characters and, in the end, loving them all even though I wondered how they could be so endearing and yet so manipulative in their own right.  I must say, I do not usually read the same author twice, but I may need to do so with this one!
B000268QB2|5.0|I think of Keane as one of the important bands on the new british wave, a very melodic band, stylish and tight.Tom Chaplin is an awesome singer. I also found their style quite fresh, the lack of guitars but the power in this case of the keys it's a sweet blend. This album is great.
0684800713|5.0|Accessible book, typical Hemingway. Very readable and pleasant, and of great quality, especially for so young an author. Not in the same league as other literature of the 20th century, but still literature. Very nutritious for the brain, even if the taste isn't as refined as, say, \\"Lolita.\\"
B00097A5I6|1.0|I wouldn't buy this album if it was free. First of all, the band itself isn't that great. I just don't get the fuss about them. Every song sounds the same. Secondly, Liam Gallagher is a total idiot. All he does is badmouth other bands (a lot better than his) because he obviously feels inadequate. Alex Kaparanos of Franz Ferdinand recently called him \\"a neurotic schoolgirl\\" and I couldn't agree more. Instead of talking trash about bands in order to try and sell more records, he should worry about trying to improve his own.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" opened in a few large cities and has slowly rolled out into the rest of the country.  Along the way, it's picked up nominations from nearly every critics group and for every award possible.  Thus, when some people across the country finally have the opportunity to view \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" it will have been built up incredibly.  I'm sure many people are very eager to see the \\"gay cowboy\\" movie that's winning so many awards.  Unfortunately, I think some people may be disappointed.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is ultimately a small film, even if it does break some barriers.  There have been hundreds of successful gay films, but somehow this one, largely because it twists the western mythos of macho straight cowboys, has already attained almost mythical stature.  But please remember that it's a small, leisurely-paced movie.<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play the cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  In 1963, they're hired by a rancher to watch a flock of sheep on a forlorn mountaintop. Indeed, both have lead pretty desolate lives - Ennis was orphaned early, and Jack's father was a cruel jerk, as we witness later.  Being a cowboy was obviously a hard life and the best they can hope for is to get some steady ranch work.  Long days together lead to the inevitable small talk and whiskey drinking as well as something else unforeseen - sex.<br /><br />However, whatever surprise the two men feel about having sex together seems dwarfed by the shock that they've found something in each other that they've never found anyplace else.  Different viewers may disagree about what Ennis and Jack see in each other; some may see the acceptance between the men or the end to their loneliness that they find together.  Whatever it is, they never find it again.  After the leave the mountain, they separate - Ennis marries quickly and Jack eventually follows suit.  Four years passes before they see each other again; unexpectedly to them, their feelings for each other are completely undiminished.  So begins a 20 plus year relationship marked with yearning that will never be satisfied.<br /><br />To some audiences, this film will just be a gay love story.  However, I think it's much closer in tone to one of Ang Lee's prior films, \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  Jane Austen specialized in love stories where characters' longing to be together is often outweighed by the price of being together.  At one point, Jack offers to spend his life with Ennis, but Ennis, always the more pragmatic of the two, knows that two men living together in 1960s Wyoming would be nearly impossible.<br /><br />In all aspects, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is finely wrought.  Ang Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard, and the cinematography is breath-taking.  The script is from Pulitizer winner Annie Proulx's fine short story and was adapted by another Pulitzer winner, Larry McMurtry.  In many ways, the film's simple portrait of the West is similar to McMurty's work in classics such as \\"Hud\\" and \\"The Last Picture Show.\\"  The supporting cast is uniformly good, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.  However, the revelation is truly Heath Ledger.  Aside from his work as the son of a racist in 2001's \\"Monster Ball,\\" he hasn't shown much acting promise.  Nevertheless, he perfectly captures Ennis.  He's likely to be nominated for an Oscar and perhaps even challenge Philip Seymour Hoffman \\"(\\"Capote\\") for the win.  Indeed, it's likely that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will win more than a few Oscars this year, and it's most worthy of the attention.ach other are completely undiminished.

B00080ZHFK|4.0|Esta pelicula lograda por Martin Scorsese basada en la vida del joven empresario millonario, Howard Hughes personificado por Leonardo DiCaprio es una gran produccion.<br /><br />En la misma se explora la personalidad de este famoso inventor y hombre de grandes proyectos.  Hay que mencionar que las mujeres fueron su gran pasion ademas de los aviones.  La protagonista Blanche hace una buena personificacion del personaje de Katherine Hepburn, y pone en duda que realmente lo amara.  Aun asi no dejo fuera de su coleccion a otras bellezas como la Ava Gardner, Mansfield, y otras.  Aunque se negaba a aceptar su disturbio mental \\"obsesivo compulsivo\\" en la pelicula se explora que debido a la forma en que fue criado desarrollo una mania con la limpieza extrema.  Tambien esto forma en su personalidad resentimientos que se manifiesta en el rechazo a los objetos que fueron tocados por otras personas a las cuales le ocasionaron dolor, como la quema de toda su ropa cuando Kate lo dejo.<br /><br />Aunque la pelicula explora estos aspectos, que explican en parte su manera de no dejarse vencer facilmente, y la toma de riesgos forma parte de sus fortalezas, su parte infantil domina casi todos los aspectos de su vida.<br /><br />La epoca de la vida de Hughes (1920-1945) es una en la que la revoluci'on industrial estaba en su desarrollo pleno.  Las guerras que azotaban Europa, y los paises aliados formaron parte de su historia y aportacion a estos hechos historicos.  Hollywood era la meca del lujo y lo extravaganza y donde el cine hizo gala de la epoca de oro.  Estos eventos, recrean sus proyectos cinematograficos basados en batallas aereas.<br /><br />En los momentos finales, nos recuerda al \\"Citizen Kane\\" de Orson Wells y nos deja practicamente deseando ver mas cuando llega a sus escenas finales.  La busqueda de la perfeccion y la insatisfaccion predomina en sus ambiciosos proyectos, y no deja de ser admirado por cuanto no se deja que nadie se interponga en las empresas que tiene como metas.<br /><br />\\"To reach the perfection, begins with me\\"r /> <br />\\"To reach the perfection, begins with me\\"
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|It's a disappointing thing when a truly unique band puts out a fantastic debut album only to have each subsequent album fall short.  The problem usually lies somewhere between a pre-polished and therefore inflexible sound and the band's over-willingness to put their best foot forward.  All the best songs go onto that first record (and who can blame them), but when the time comes to make a follow-up, the band have already put all of its eggs in one basket.  The only way to go is down.  Heartbreakingly, the Strokes seem to fall into this category. <br /> <br />It was clear that the time had come for the band to dive into a different sound--vocalist Julian Casablancas' fuzz box wouldn't have worked a third time out--however, on \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" they've only put a toe in the water.  The band shuck the old licks and hooks of their debut but never quite achieve a new aesthetic, leaving them in a plodding, redundant limbo. <br /> <br />Casablancas' songwriting seems to be pushing away from a pop-based verse-chorus structure while the rest of the band struggles to hold onto it; the result being a watered-down compromise of forgettable arrangements and stale crooning.  When they do manage a clear alternation between chorus and verse, it often feels artificial and disjointed, such as on the first single, \\"Juicebox.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, the entire record sounds as if the producer, David Kahne, took a very hands-off approach to the creative direction.  Several of the songs clocked in at four minutes when then would have done better to end at two and half.  \\"First Impressions\\" is also longer than each previous album by three tracks.  With all this extra filler, it's easy to believe Casablancas when he repeatedly moans, \\"I've got nothing to say,\\" on the seventh track, \\"Ask Me Anything.\\" <br /> <br />One has to wonder what kind of deal the band has with RCA and whose decision it was to crank out a new Strokes record every two years.  This album was clearly rushed.  Someone should let both the band and their label know that fans would be perfectly willing to wait an extra year or so for a more solid album of stronger, shorter, and fewer tracks. <br /> <br />Are you paying attention, Franz Ferdinand?
B00008J4P5|5.0|Out of all the bands out there, White Stripes is my top favorite band. This has to be one of my favorite albums they have made so far. Their alternative garage rock music is really good. My favorite songs being Seven Nation Army,The Hardest Button to Button, and The Air Near My Fingers. Once you listen to this band and album, it'll change your way of listening to music. SO GO BUY THIS ALBUM AND ENJOY!!!!

B00004VXX1|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />There are many great movies from the realm of science fiction and this is one of the best and most family friendly too. This movie has great fighting scenes, great special effect, cool characters, and a cool story. If you are really really picky about the realities of time travel then you might have issues with this movie, but then you probably aren't watching that much science fiction anyways. Another movie that is scarier, but also great in the way this movie is the movie Aliens, the second movie of the 4 movies about the acid-blooded, egg laying aliens and the character Riply. However, I think this is a movie that is more appropriate for little kids (not too little), and a movie that can be watched over and over again, as it's just plain fun!
B000A59PMO|5.0|\\"It's one of the best-written television series I have ever seen, and it has a lot to offer people still mourning the loss of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's smart, funny, edgy, and rewards patient viewers with one hell of a mystery.<br /><br />17-year-old Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell, Spartan) has had a rough year. Her best friend was murdered. Her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni, Galaxy Quest), once the sheriff of the small Soouthern California town of Neptune, was fired during the investigation because his search led him to the very wealthy Kane family, including Veronica's ex-boyfriend Duncan (Teddy Dunn, The Manchurian Candidate). After being fired as sheriff, Keith became a private investigator and Veronica's mom disappeared. She lost her considerable popularity at the prestigious Neptune High, and now works for her dad, when she's not carrying on her own investigation of her friend's murder. She will stop at nothing to find the truth, even if it puts her own life at risk.<br /><br />Much of the credit needs to go to Rob Thomas, who obviously remembers clearly what it feels like to be a teenager. The teen cast is impulsive, uncertain, and frustrated, and watching them interact is almost uncomfortably reminiscent of high school. This could be a drawback for viewers who forget how it feels to be a teen, but it's an impressive feat to those able to remember with immediacy the uncertainty of teenage life. While that alone helps Veronica Mars stand against the competition, the adult characters are also surprisingly well-written. Some of the teachers come across as parodies, but the relationship between Veronica and her father is well developed, and avoids the usual TV parent stereotypes. The series also does a fine job of juggling references to pop culture and high culture. It's quite savvy, making references to things that are still fresh a year after the episodes were broadcast, but it also has a deep well of high culture references. Holders of useless English Literature degrees are going to eat this series up. Culturally adept viewers will also enjoy the celebrity cameos and inside jokes, none of which I will spoil here. Needless to say, it's a very cool show.<br /><br />Equal credit needs to go to the cast. Kristen Bell is truly fantastic as Veronica Mars, with enough charisma to easily carry the show on her own. Veronica is funny, smart, and fiery, but also wins our sympathy through her sincerity and vulnerability. She's good at what she does, even though she often makes very stupid choices. At first glance, the remainder of the characters are stereotypes. There's Weevil (Francis Capra), for instance, the tough local gang leader. A major antagonist early in the season comes is Logan (Jason Dohring), the spoiled son of a rich and famous actor. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is one of Veronica's only friends at the start, a new guy to the school. As the episodes unfold, we gradually see beneath the generic surface of the characters. None of the characters are who they seem at first, and their web of relationships becomes ever more complicated as they interact through the season.<br /><br />After the first two episodes, I was a bit worried that Veronica Mars would settle into a bland TV series groove. It also looked like it may have had too many balls in the air, much like Joan of Arcadia. I didn't need to worry. As the show progresses, a dark edge starts to creep in. There are still a number of funny incidents, but they begin to be overwhelmed by the grim investigation of the main murder. The suspense surrounding the case builds throughout the season, leading to a final few episodes that are nail-bitingly suspenseful and even a bit creepy. Every detail in the series winds up being important, even the details of the cases that aren't part of the main plot. By the end of the season, whole sections of the jigsaw puzzle start to fall into place, until the truth is finally revealed at the very end. I'm looking forward to a second viewing of the season, if only to watch once again how all these details come together.<br /><br />Which brings me to another high point regarding Veronica Mars. Although some threads are left slightly open at the end of the first season, the show has the decency to close off the main plot thread in a satisfying way. If the series had been canceled after the first season (which it thankfully wasn't), it would still be a great story. So many series now seem to be constantly pushing towards the next big twist. Networks are so afraid of failure that they try to string viewers along viewers with the proverbial carrot-always held in front of us, but never within reach. I want to see the second season of Veronica Mars, not because I just have to find out what will happen next, but because the journey of this first season was such an enjoyable one. Whatever Veronica's next big case is, I don't want to miss it. And should the show jump the shark in the future, this season will still stand on its own as a monumental success.<br /><br />bY Dvdverdict.a second viewing of the season, if only to watch once again how all these details come together. <br /> <br />Which brings me to another high point regarding Veronica Mars.

0380799006|5.0|In a nutshell, this book is outstanding because it adds to the general field of knowledge about parenting. As a therapist, I have received parenting skills training from a number of books and programs.  <br /> <br />However, I realized from reading this book that most of parenting skills are taught from a standpoint of \\"one child at a time.\\" This is great, but it is often impractical in real life, as many families have more than one child. <br /> <br />There are a couple of reasons I would recommend this book. The first is that it is probably the easiest to read book I have read regarding a complicated topic in a LONG time. It is told almost in story format, as the author is teaching a group on sibling rivalry. The \\"class members\\" (a conglomerate of the author's workshop experiences) provide stories and bring up concerns that any parent might have. There are also valuable summary sheets and comic strips that illustrate the principles being discussed. <br /> <br />The other reason why I would recommend this book is that it will add to your general body of knowledge about sibling relationships and will help you to see them in a new way. It talks about the myth of equality, and the dangers of comparison and roles. You won't regret the information that this book provides.
0790731479|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid!  I loved the characters and the creepy special effects.  the ghosts were funny, but the living humans were even funnier!  it's just a fun movie that you can sit back and enjoy.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I don't know why, but this movie has always moved me.  I have loved it since I was a kid, and when it came out on VHS, it was mine.  I have watched it so many times that my tape is failing.  I am extremely happy that it is FINALLY coming out on DVD.  Gabrielle has a vocation, she gives up a family that loves her to enter the convent.  She wants to be sent to the Congo to nurse the natives.  But her faith, or more accurately, her obedience is tested over and over again.  The end is not certain, it leaves you to ponder and determine how you would end the movie.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I think That Damian Marley holds up well to heir his dad. All of his music makes sense, adn there is alwasy a song taht u can relate to because most of them are positive or they mean to b. Liek my favorite song on the album, Road To Zion, its got a melancholy sound, but the stuff hes talking about is good natured. Talking about how u got to keep walking if ya want to make it, and stay on track. Its got a great beat, and the string chords add a good darkness taht is needed for the song, and NYC rapper Nas drops a tite lil verse bout wats goin on in the world. Teh song Pimpa's Paradise is a good but sad song about prostitution and a nasty coke habit. Makes ya think about all teh addicts and problems that we have in teh world today. And of course there is Welcome to Jamrock, which talks abotu Marleys home town in a wya that makes it more desperate and desolate then any ghettos in our own country. Never thought jamaica was so rough but i was rong i guess. All of teh otehr tracks are actually pretty good to, and they have reallly really deep reggae beats, and on move he samples from his own dads hit song called Exodus. Over all a 5 star album and i think Damian has a profitable and prosperous future if he continues down this path to zion.lol
B00011F5DK|5.0|The age rating is not correct for this game.  It is really for 5 on up. We have had players from ages 11-55 play together and those in their 20's LOVE it!  Excellent game, well made in every way. Can be played strategically or randomly but still engages the mind in a delightful, tactile way.
B0000669JL|5.0|Man ive alwasy loved the Marley families music. love that laid back flow and style of reggae and how good the music makes ya feel. Bob is teh epitome of this music. Of course it doesnt get ne better then him. This is one of the best GH cds ive ever herd, and thast not jus because its a Marley cd. I like almost every song, but thast not saying that he made ne bad music, because he certainly did not. alwasy a good mssg in a song by him. My favorite song is exodus simply because of the club sound and it just sounds rlly cool. Of cours eu have Get Up Stand Up which is a great song bout fighting for wat ya believe in. People Get Ready is very laid back and its just about getting together and having fun. Those are my2 favorite but all of teh rest are good to. Pick it up if you liek good music
0312263120|1.0|First of all sorry for my English. <br /> <br />I have read Dan Brown's other 3 books and things are getting worse from book to book. <br /> <br />This last one was a fairy tale for children... the scenario was so childish and full of holes... I was really pissed off!...  <br /> <br />Just two of them... <br /> <br /> <br />...spoiler... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />1. How in the world this super technological NSA's cryptography center did not have one single security light in it!!! Security lights were only in the basement... hahaha... And almost half of the book is inside the dark rooms!!!! <br /> <br />2. And how in the world there was not a shutdown mechanism of the \\"super computer\\" when there was overheating!!! My 700 euro PC has one... <br /> <br />Well I can mension about 10-20 more, but as I told you it is a total waste of time! <br /> <br />Wish I could give him -5 stars...
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is without doubt one of the best of modern American humorists and he does not fail to build on this reputation in his book on travels in Australia \\"In a Sunburned Country.\\"  Despite the very real problems that he outlines in his more sober discussion of the Australian aborigines, this is certainly one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br /><br />From the outback to the large cities of the only country that is also a continent, Bryson covers the essence of a land not that dissimilar from the American Southwest, where I grew up.  Yet, as he acknowledges, he has only touched on this really huge country.<br /><br />From trying to explain the significance of stromatolites to an elderly day-tripper at Shark Bay to discussing the various deadly organisms in Australia (and they have a lot!) with various companions, to traveling to really out of the way parts of the outback like Stingybark Creek, and conversely to big modern cities like Brisbane and Sydney, Bryson gives us a tantalizing glimpse of a very complex land.<br /><br />Having never been to Australia, I have to rely on the few Australian friends and acquaintances I have accumulated for my own impression.  If they are any indication, than Bryson has not painted too extreme a picture.<br /><br />Now if Bryson would only write a book on the American Southwest!  I'm sure he would find a lot of material in Arizona, New Mexico and west Texas!<br /><br />Read this book if you are at all interested in Australia or just like to read humorous travel books.  Bryson does not cover everything of interest, to be sure, but he should wet you appitite for the land down under!
B000002534|5.0|Comments about silly lyrics and mediocre R&B miss the point. This album is a trip to the listeners inner world of spirituality. Carlos Santana has often said he sees his music as a way to explore and raise spirituality in this world, and on that level this album is perfection. The music is beautiful, and will move you to a higher plane, if only for 45 minutes or so.
0307276902|5.0|Life has a funny way of delivering what you need when you need it.  I needed this book.  It restored my hope in humanity.  It reminded me that living life without judgement is the best way. It also reminded me that at one time I got that concept of how simple life is.  Then I complicated it.  After completing A Million Little Pieces, I've decided to make life simple again. <br /> <br />I'm not an alcoholic, a drug addict or a criminal.  I'm not an Oprah book club fan.  I picked the book up because Oprah said she couldn't put it down.  Without judgement (I guess, I hope) I thought...check it out.  Without judgement I borrow ideas and thoughts from James Frey to improve my life. <br /> <br />I miss Lilly.
B000002KKS|5.0|Okay first to clear anything the Ozzy/ early sabbath obsessives have to say, Ozzy didn't contribute anything to Sabbath when he sang for them. Butler wrote the lyrics and helped Iommi write the music. Ozzy's solo career only took off because of Randy Rhoads' (yay)outstanding talent. Early Sabbath consisted of primitive, dark 6th-string based power chords and was very simple in structure. Iommi's style gradually changed from the original Sabbath style to a bunch of stuff that all sounded the same to a far more intricate incarnation in the 80's.  <br /> <br />After ejecting Ozzy, Sabbath, now with Ronnie James Dio, produced one of the finest metal releases of all time, Heaven and Hell. Dio's voice is somewhat reminiscent of a disgruntled Freddie Mercury and helps the sound change to a sort of demonic glam metal. Iommi's guitar tone is amazing, and his riffs are vastly improved over simple, overrated licks like Iron Man and Sweet Leaf. The variety on the album is impressive, a refreshing break from many earlier albums, which all sounded practically the same. Honestly, however, the shining moment of all of Black Sabbath comes with the amazing title track, which reverts to the excellent progression of slow-fast-slow, like Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody. This track makes all other songs in the Sabbath catalogue seem like filler. The album is worth it solely for the song Heaven & Hell.

B000C1YL1G|5.0|\\"Curtain Call\\" is about as good a single-disc career overview of this mercurial rapper as we will ever get. <br /> <br />To feel the full force of his rage and power, you still need to listen to \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" all the way through, beginning to end. And probably \\"The Eminem Show\\" as well. <br />But as a document of his talent, this is pretty amazing. <br />I've always found the intertwining of his three \\"characters\\" fascinating. Is he singing as Mathers, Eminem or Slim Shady? They're NOT the same person at all. He often sings as one of them TO another. It's like climbing into the head of a psychotic schizophrenic. <br /> <br />Having said that, he is an extraordinarily talented rapper. Technically speaking, he's phenomenal. Normally song lyricists (and rap writers), when rhyming, end each line with one or two syllables that rhyme...Eminem can stretch that to four or five. Sometimes it feels as if he's rhyming entire sentences. When he off and running, it'll make you hold your breath. <br /> <br />The musical production is top-notch; it IS Dr. Dre after all, and Eminem clearly paid attention during his time with him, as his own production is fairly imaginative as well. <br /> <br />His lyrics are incendiary. Those who are easily offended should stay away.  <br /> <br />This is one angry individual. The line between autobiography, biography and fiction has never been more blurry. That's the thing: is he singing ABOUT himself, TO himself or simply telling a story? <br /> <br />He is also the rare rapper who can create massively popular singles without an ounce of compromise, \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Lose Yourself\\" being the two most obvious examples.  <br /> <br />We live in a world where Eminem has more Academy Awards than Martin Scorsese, by the way. <br /> <br />The new songs are OK, but they're simply gravy. The Elton John duet is a kick. The extra CD adds a few essential songs (\\"Kill You\\", \\"Renegade\\") with some filler. <br /> <br />If you've never heard Eminem,this is a fine place to start. If you have all the CDs already, it's nice to have all these songs in one spot...
0312323859|5.0|This book was GREAT.  It just pulled me in.  Darcy was a completely flawed character.  Selfish, vain, and shallow.  This books shows how Darcy slowly learns how to find herself, to be happy with herself, make good choices, and care about others. Even with her being so flawed I could not help be attached and rooting for her in her search for autonomy.  Ethan was a pleasant and real surprize, I love what they came to be.  This is a book that stirred my feelings.  A must read.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Closer is one of those films you have to prepare yourself for. Anyone who's seen a play that's been adapted to film will know that there's not a heckuva lot of action (this one being Patrick Marber's excellent Broadway play). But you can get some excellent dialogue and great character studies.<br /><br />Meet four screwed-up but beautiful people: Alice (Natalie Portman), an American stripper just arrived in London who gets bumped by a car; Dan (Jude Law), an obituary columnist for a local newspaper; Anna (Julia Roberts), a professional photographer who's recently divorced; and Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist with serious sexual issues.<br /><br />When Dan sees Alice hit by the car, he rushes to her aid and helps her to the hospital, where she's treated and released. But a strange relationship develops as the two banter back and forth with some snappy dialogue and incisive glances. Dan also knows Anna, the photographer, and is \\"in love\\" with her and tries to get her into a relationship. But when she refuses (initially) Dan and Alice move in together. But he's not through with Anna. Dan pretends to be her during an on-line chat session with Larry, the dermatologist, and asks to meet him at the London Aquarium, where Dan knows Anna visits and shoots film often. Thus, Larry makes an a$$ of himself when he first meets Anna, but they soon are entwined in a relationship, too.<br /><br />About a year later, because of Dan's persistence, Anna relents and forms a relationship with him, even though she's now married to Larry. And Larry is a bit taken with Alice (the stripper), too. Sound convoluted? It is, but it's also terribly insightful into the lives of human beings.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />As I stated at the beginning of this review, the movie-watcher needs to be prepared for a film like this before sitting down with it. It's not fast-paced or action driven. It's ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. The awful and wonderful things we do to each other isn't candy-coated, and the language is brusque and often pornographic.<br /><br />There are also some nice little secrets about the characters that seep into the film and add a titillating surprise for those who watch CLOSER than most (for instance, check out \\"Alice's\\" passport toward the end of the film as she re-enters the United States).<br /><br />Be warned, though, this film isn't for everyone. Children and preteens should NOT watch it. Those who don't care for the vulgarities of sex-talk should also avoid it. But if you enjoy intense characters doing profound things to each other, you'll undoubtedly delight in this little flick.OUT THE CHARACTERS.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|There are some strong songs on this CD (the first 4 are very good, especially You Only Live Once) but after On The Other Side it stars to drag. Several decent songs on this CD are killed by there bad choruses, especially Killing Lies (still one of the highlights, even with a weak chorus) and Fear of Sleep. The clever songwriting and amazing hooks that made Is This It such a classic (and were still around for some of Room on Fire) have almost totally been lost. A decent buy, but for you to enjoy it you have to realize these are not the Strokes of old.
B00005JCAA|1.0|WARNING:  WATCHING THIS FILM WILL CAUSE SEVERE REACTIONS OF AWEFULNESS, NEAR NAUSEA, DISMAY, SHOCK, DISBELIEF, UTTER BEFUDDLMENT AND POSSIBLE THOUGHTS OF WANTING TO MURxxx THE SCREENPLAY WRITER.  This film sucks big time, beyond anything else you've ever even imagined.  Brad Pitt plays an other-world creature, who didn't even have a name.  It captures the body of a character played by Brad Pitt in the 1st 15 minutes of the film, and when he dies, takes over his body.  This creature didn't even have a name (except \\"Death\\"), and truly, DOESN'T KNOW JACK ABOUT JACK.  LITERALLY, the whole movie is about this creature using Brad Pitt's body to discover the most simply, basic things about human life.  I.E. - LIKE A BLOOMING FxxKING IDIOT, IT STARES AT DOOR KNOBS, GLASSES, FOOD, PEOPLE, CHAIRS, LIGHTS, FLOORS, IN TOTALY IDIOT-STATE AMAZEMENT, never having seen anything, never knowing anything, just simply acting like a MORON.  For 3 hours, it is shear torture.  If you watch this film in entirety, FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE WRITER, STUDIO AND PRODUCER.  TORTURE WAS OUTLAWED IN THE MODERN WORLD circa the 1700's, and what this film causes to all who watch it MUST BE CONSIDERED AS UNLAWFUL, LIABLE, AT-FAULT, NEGLIGENT action worthy of greatest contempt against those who perpetrated it.  Sue for at least $15 Million per person who saw it !!!!
0679422714|1.0|this is a passionate book borne of horrendous personal experience; what it is not is a valuable history of mao and his era. while deservedly exoriating mao for everything from his ruthlessness to his womanizing, it provides no insights into how mao triumphed. rather than repeat reviews that have been written, it is strongly suggested that interested readers turn to andrew nathan's devastating and meticulous review in the london review of books. this is, in the end, a book to confirm manichean views of china, not an effort at serious historical inquiry.
B00005NWLO|3.0|Forget Lynyrd Skynyrd, if you want an example of real down home southern musicianship, get a copy of `the Fillmore Concerts\\" by the Allman Brothers Band.  Lynyrd Skynyrd has always been and will always be a watered down third rate group of Allman Brothers wannabees and this collection proves it.  While the Brothers are secretly an awesome blues & jazz group masquerading as a rock band, Skynyrd is little better than a weak attempt to replicate the Allman Brother's magic.     Whereas the Brothers use the studio versions of their songs as little more than a reference point for the live versions, Skynyrd almost never varies from the studio version.  The guitar playing lacks intensity as well as inspiration.  The keyboards are a bit better than the guitar, but still nothing to write home about.  The drumming and bass are so basic that they are barely worth noting.     If Skynyrd has anything going for them, it's the songwriting of Ronny Van Zant.  Despite being saddled with a really crappy band that wouldn't know good slide guitar playing if it snuck up and beat them in the head, Ronny was able to write some really good lyrics.  On the whole, most of his songs are honest, heartfelt and speak easily to most people.    But good lyrics alone do not a good band make, it also takes instrumental brilliance.  And that is something Skynyrd never had and isn't likely to ever get.  Pass on this one and get \\"the Fillmore Concerts\\" by the Allman Brothers instead.      Several Weeks Later:    WOW!!! Did I ever kick over a hornet's nest when I wrote this review.  I expected to start some conversation, but I had no idea that people would respond with as much vehemence as they did.  After having read some of the responses that others have posted here and stuffed into my email I now feel the need to clear some things up.    It's hard when you are trying to decide which CD's to purchase to get an objective view by only reading reviews posted by fans gushing over their pets.  While good reviews are helpful, criticism also has it's place.  I'm sorry if others find my comparison of Skynyrd and the Brothers to be unfair, but people seeking to find info on the product they are considering spending their money on have the right to hear from those who are less than impressed.    I'm sorry I didn't fall over myself for Skynyrd, but as a southerner, I am very proud of the accomplishments of southern musicians and composers, which I consider to be among the finest in the world.  I wanted the shoppers here to know that if they are interested in exploring the music of this extremely influential region that there were better places to go than mullet rockers like Skynyrd.      I'm not insecure about the status of my favorite band, the ABB, instead I just think that buyers should explore what I consider to be a better use of their music buying dollar.  Other \\"southern rock\\" live albums I would recommend before this one include,   North Mississippi Allstars: Hill Country Revue  Widespread Panic:  Live In the Classic City  Derek Trucks Band: Live at the GA Theater  Black Crows & Jimmy Page

B0006L16N8|5.0|when i first heard the song I thought it was cool that coldplay was singing an old johnny cash song.  It wasn't until searching on the web did I realize the song was written for Johnny Cash but he never got a chance to record it before passing away.  Bob Dylan should consider recording it as well.  I have this feeling that after all the other great songs on the album have been forgotten Till Kingdom Come will be a classic.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Terrible title... but a pretty good record. Great? Not in the least. It's more mainstream... slightly Cars-y. But here's the thing -  name a better major label straight-up rock n roll record on the shelf right now? ...  Well, I'm waiting. And if you say The Darkness I'm gonna slap ya. I mean look at Amazon's top 25... you got Coldplay and Green Day STILL up there. The bottom line is, we're in a little bit of a rock drought right now. So give these guys a little props for at least offering us fans a drink.  PS Don't miss their live show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00025ETIW|3.0|Lemme just start by saying that I by-in-large cannot stand 98% of mainstream bands.  Not because I'm closed-minded or anti-establishment but because that 98% sound just like what they are, some kind of made-to-order band in a box pushing out tunes to turn corporate revenues. Another thing I cannot stand is baseless criticism, even if its against something that deserves it. <br /> <br />MCR may be in the CD player(or MP3 player, if you're hip like you know you are.) of every 13-15 year old mallgoth within a 150 mile radius, but that doesn't make their music suck (Hahaha! Oh.. it doesn't?).  The comparisons I've seen drawn to being Sisters of Mercy or Cure immitators with Geddy Lee (Geddy LEE?!) as a vocalist are nothing but absurd and totally irrelevant. Even if you don't like them, they sound nothing like any of the above, no matter how much of a cold Geddy has, or how much vicodin the Sisters have been taking. <br /> <br />More to the point, eventhough their image comes off as being totally pretentious due in no small part to their rabid prepubescent fanbase, the music isn't half bad.  Just because a bunch of 13 year old take their songs and lyrics as holy scripture doesn't make it so, nor does it mean that's how it was intented to be taken. To me the band seems to carry a healthy sense of sardonic irony along side some otherwise cliche themes.  It seems painfully obvious that while some of the songs may certainly be heartfelt, they're not setting out to earnestly bare their innermost soul to the world on a totally sincere level. <br /> <br />The music is a thickly punk-laced machination of alternative rock, regardless of however many other miscellaneous subgenre titles you want to slap onto it to make it seem more cutting edge.  Sweet Revenge is a solid album that carries a nice sense of organic style; notably weighted to punk sensibilities, marred with melody and even dashed with the occasional guitar solo. The singer's pseudo-neurotic sarcastic sneer of a voiceis almost endearing and at times quite amusing. What this album it lacks in being truly inovative it makes up for with solid, tasteful delivery; and what else can you really ask of a mainstream band? <br /> <br />I still hate them... every time I listen to the album.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|This movie is divided into four parts  <br /> <br />The first 30 minutes grabbed me it was excellent.  From the opening song \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" to that point in the movie where they got on the boat.  You really got a feeling of depth to a few of these characters and you wanted to like them.   <br /> <br />The \\"three hour cruise\\" (at least it felt like one) is the part where the movie starts to slip.  Charecters are introduced and you connect with them only to see them killed off briefly later on in the movie.  You think to yourself oh yeah that was the guy that spoke to the chick for 30 seconds or oh look there goes the Chinese animal handler.  I guess because the crew wasn't diverse enough)   <br /> <br />The Island Part (the third part) is where the movie loses it.   <br />Its an hour and  of Peter Jackson running around with a computer going like a little kid saying \\"look how big I can make the dinosaurs\\" \\"Look I can make them stampede\\", \\"I can make them fight each other\\", \\"I can make them fight Kong.  Five at once isn't that cool?\\"  \\"You wanna see how gross I can make the spider cave? \\"  An hour and more of endless ceaseless noise that drowned out any of the good parts of the movie.      <br /> <br />The only bright spot in this entire segment was King Kong himself,.  He may have looked like something out of Mighty Joe Young but the only part that kept me awake through this part of the movie was when he kept making the blond girl fall down.  I laughed my butt off.   <br /> <br />Despite my problems with the movie I could have been happy with it at this point if it wasn't for part four.  They all make it back to civilization and no one has learned anything, except for Kong and the Blond girl.  By this point I was looking at my watch.   <br /> <br />Overall-You may think I'm being unfair.  My cousins that I went to go see this with on Christmas day certainly thought I was insane.  They did not understand what I was trying to say which is computer generation is fine as long as there is some depth to it.  There is no depth here.  I don't want flash when I see a movie I wanted just want character development and a little plot continuity.  If you want a good movie go see \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\" if you can find it playing somewhere.  It did a better job of getting me to care about characters and it had 1/20th of the budget of Kong.   <br />
B000002J3W|5.0|\\"Slave to the Grind\\" is their best CD without a doubt, but if you skipped this CD when it was released because you were into grunge, then you need to go back and buy it. I overlooked it too. Wow. What a powerful sound they got on this. Very dark and moody songs, but VERY HEAVY. Sebastian Bachs voice is unbelievable. Loud, clear, and he holds notes forever! Both guitarists absolutely smoke on the songs. So crunchy and heavy. \\"Firesign\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Beat Yourself Blind\\" and \\"Remains to be Seen\\" are incredible songs. \\"Breakin' Down\\" is a better ballad than \\"I'll Remember You\\" was. I can't stop listening to this CD since I got it. The only people who gave this a bad review are the ones who wanted the first CD sound, not the \\"Slave\\" sound. HEAVY!! <br />
B000A6T1KE|3.0|First of all I want to say I'm a die hard Star Trek fan. I've seen almost all of the episodes and have all the movies. From all of these sources I can clearly say this IS the WORSTE Star Trek anything that I have ever seen. But that doesn't nessisarily mean this is a terrible movie. A great story with excellent dialougue and great characters [Shinzon is a foremittable enemy]. The banter many of the characters share is hilarious and the dialougue Shinzon says in general is awesome. But I have to ASK: WHY THE HELL DID THEY HAVE TO GIVE DATA SUCH A CPAPPY DEATH?! The reasons were bearable enough but why did Data have to die? I can honestly state that they better make a new STTNG film and resurrect Data and fast before any other 24th century Trek-anything comes out! Overrall [not including Data's death] not a bad movie.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I accidentally watched Eraserhead many years ago on the big screen with a younger distant relative from the farmlands out West. I expected him to be creeped out and bewildered. Instead he educated me to the pretentiousness of the coasts--he roared with laughter through the whole thing! <br /> <br />Not at it, mind you, and it wasn't the nervous laughter of discomfort. He thought it was a great stitch, a merciless funny-as-hell parody on dating, getting your girlfriend (who you don't care much for to begin with) pregnant, dealing with the idiot parents, dealing with the alien baby (as all babies are for a young accidental parent), etc. Dang if my yokel cousin wasn't right and dang if most of the trendies and intellectuals oozing over this wonderful movie weren't missing the point utterly because they had very different lives, more directly in tune with John Water's nearly contemporaneous middle-class rip, Polyester. Eraserhead was working class, laboring folk stuff--it reeks of Akron, Ohio, and Wal-Mart, and homes next to decaying factories that are still, by a thread, in operation. <br /> <br />Since then I've seen this movie as it is and enjoy it as a first-rate black comedy that makes tons and tons of sense. My college friends still don't get it, after all, if the girlfriend gets pregnant it's an inconvenience that's dealt with elsewhere. None of these Ivy Leagers had ever dated the daughter of a Polish-Catholic factory worker. <br /> <br />Enjoy, but try to see this landmark comedy for what it is!
B00020HEL6|5.0|I got this cd for Christmas and have listen to it more times than I can remember.  <br /> <br />I remember seeing Renne on on Oprah awhile back and remembering wow what a voice.  <br /> <br />I am looking forward to more cd's to come. Maybe some more duets as well. On a slow boat to China is one of my favorite songs. As well as a Sunday kinda of Love.  <br /> <br />This cd is great to listen to no matter what you are doing. A young Ella in the works! You won't be disappointed that you bought this cd.  <br /> <br />Keep up the great work Renee! Now if we can only get Still Standing to come out on dvd I'll be even happier!
0312954468|2.0|I was a little intimidated by the fact that the author, Wilbur Smith, has written (to date) 27 novels.  Wow.  I'm still working on my first.  This is the first book of his that I have read, and I hesitate to say that although it is a well written, well plotted story of ancient Egypt with lots of action, it seemed a bit formulaic.  There is a handsome, noble hero and the young and beautiful but naive woman that he loves, the evil and perverted grand vizier, the weak-minded, vascillating Pharoah, as well as the clever, brilliant eunuch who tells the story, and dozens of lesser characters.  The problem, for me, was that the plot seemed a bit too familiar.  As soon as I read that the Pharoah's many wives had only given him daughters, I knew he would want to take the hero's love-interest to bed.  Sure enough, a few pages later, the Pharoah marries the girl.  She decides to kill herself, but is stopped by her loyal eunuch.  I felt I was reading (except for the presence of a eunuch) a modern romance novel that had been transposed to the Egypt of 3,000 years ago.  But please don't get me wrong.  I did enjoy the novel, and I admire Mr. Smith's story-telling ability.  At more than 500 pages, this is a long, leisurely, and action-packed, detail-oriented adventure story, one that has obviously been thoroughly researched.  I'm sure it can help you pass a few quiet afternoons or evenings in ancient Egypt.  Just don't expect anything more than a good adventure story.
B00003CXI1|5.0|First, I must stress to all youngsters... the fantasy of magic and spell casting is NOT to be tried at home!!<br /><br />Okay, now with the warning out of the way, this film delivers entertainment in a big way. The kids are adorable (with the exception of \\"Malfoy,\\") and the monsters they encounter are well done.<br /><br />One small complaint would be that too much attention is payed to that broom riding game of theirs (do I have to spell it... \\"Quiddich?\\" Oh, don't make me spell out that name... please!)... but I suppose all \\"school pride\\" is directly tied in to their sports program.<br /><br />It feels a bit like Indiana Jones towards the end, as the three protagonists work their way through a gauntlet of challenges.  Very nice!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00005JOFO|5.0|Awesome movie. One of the best if not the best from this decade, alone. Emotionally griping and very compelling.I love it when, HOLLYWOOD, tells a controversial story. With all biases behind, this is a must see for everyone. GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!! It is not just being a liberal spreading propaganda to spook the neoconz,Pat Robertson fanatical idiots or the RUSH LIMBAUGHS of the world,who will never understand such a riveting story!!!! LOVE IS LOVE IF ITS YOUR CAT, DOG, WIFE, OR NEIGHBOR! Love affairs just happen! go with it! HOLLYWOOD KEEP PUSHING THE ENVELOPE so we can see movies, true movies, unfiltered movies! LESS RESTRICTIONS and censorship!
B00005JMAH|4.0|This is another strong incarnation of the Harry Potter phenomena.<br /><br />Especially well done is Harry's fear of the \\"grim reaper\\" like \\"Dementors,\\" a phobia he must learn to overcome.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is brought up a notch, with dramatic mountains and hillsides emphasized.<br /><br />The ultimate mystery and puzzle of the story will amaze all viewers, as the pieces come together at the end. Well done!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
0553213105|5.0|I loved this book!  I loved the thin line of love/hate that Elizabeth and Darcy walked on. And most of all I loved the happy ending.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This Harry Potter installment has more story, more intrigue. The conflict Harry has concerning his \\"true nature\\" is very effective.<br /><br />The young actors all give fine performances, and the special effects are top notch. Some of the \\"creatures\\" may be too intense for very young children.<br /><br />A must for any fantasy DVD collection.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00005NVT1|5.0|Like the other reviewers, I will bring up this point first and foremost: this CD has one 45 minute track. In my opinion its fine, I tend to listen to the CD on repeat 3-4 times while driving to my sister's or somewhere.  <br /> <br />Anyway, The CD starts off with some snares that encapsulate your senses straight away. The beats continue to mutate and change through-out the CD, and the crowd participation is great. At one point the beat starts to die down and the crowd jumps in with a beat of their own. They stomp their feet and clap their hands in unison, and one smart guy whistles his own melody in tune for about 2 minutes. Then the snares and bass start up again and carry you on into the next phase of the CD. <br /> <br />In short, this CD is great. Bare bones, yes, with only a few stickers and a CD, but still great. It will set the bar for live electronica in the future, and I doubt it will ever be topped. Long live DP! <br /> <br />5/5!
0307276902|5.0|When it comes to reading, I have one rule-Don't read any books that Oprah Winfrey has herself read. This can make it hard to read, because you just never know what she has or hasn't read. <br /> <br />That is where the Oprah book club comes in handy. Now I can be certain of the books that O has read, and I can therefore avoid the hell out of them forever and ever. Hooray! Oprah's book club makes life much easier for me, because I can now avoid many books about self absorbed ass-heads and silly poetry and all that other housewife stuff. I also avoid O magazine, unless I really need to feel empowered, then I break with tradition, read, and have a good cry.
0553801503|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because even though it was slow and anti-climatic it is still better than half the books I have read in the past year.  I discovered this series about two years ago so I did not have to wait as long for this book as some others have so I am not as mad as they rightfully are.  I understand that it is difficult for a writer to keep the story fast paced and interesting so I forgive Martin this book as long as the next one has more action.  This is still a great book.  I wouldn't compare him to Jordan and Goodkind just yet, I will reserve my judgement for the next book.  Quick question though, if he has already written so much, why is it going to be another year for the next book AND why was this book only 700 pages?  On his site, Martin says he has almost 2k pages, that would mean a 1300 page book next time?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show has an amazing ability to pull you in. To pull you in to the story, to make you want more and more. This, like the also great X-Files, is not stand alone. Episodes tie into each other, something that I like. Bring it back to TV!!!!
B000000OUJ|5.0|this album is of course one of the best wu-tang solo albums ever, this album and ONLY BUILT FOR CUBAN LINX are both amazing and wortha five star rating.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I wish I went to see this in the movie theater. I recently got done watching the series it was based off of, Firefly, which I bought because it was phenomenal. This movie is just as good. I hope and pray they will at least make another movie, or maybe some network like Sci-Fi will pick it up and make a season 2 of the show.
B000002WU9|5.0|tru criminal machine gun rap. The sounds on this album are crazy Raekwon is by far one of the best Wu-tang members and his solo album is straight fire i dunno why i didn't pik up this album b4.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I was just getting into the whole Ghost in a shell story line starting with Stand Alone complex and working backwards and I was so dissapointed in this DVD.  The story and plot are challenging enough in english; trying to read them at high speed was not fun.  They should at least put on the cover that the DVD is only in Japanese.  I feel like I was tricked into buying this.  Thanks for nothing.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Who are DM fans? People who wants them to do the same all the time? People who wants to keep dancing at 80's? I prefer to think that DM fans are people who enjoy great music, great sounds... and DM has never done that better! <br /> <br />PLAYING THE ANGEL IS BETTER THAN VIOLATOR! Imagine that PTA was released in 1990 and Violator was released in 2005? The people that complains at PTA would complaining Violator!... That's a fact! Simple reason: compare the songs with some similarities between them! <br /> <br />1. World in My Eyes x A Pain That I'm Used To. A Pain That I'm To is far more mature muscially, uplifiting. World im My Eyes is a great song, but is nothing more than a good, flat and basic synth-dance song... A Pain That I'm Used To is a perfect opnening... Imagine this song as the first in Violator... WOW!!! <br /> <br />2. Personal Jesus x John the Revelator. Two strong religion-themed songs, and JTR is good as PJ. PJ has a brilliant guitar line, and works fine live... JTR is strong and incredibly danceable, more catchy than World in My Eyes. JTR and PJ has great chorus both. People criticize JTR lyrics (revelator, elevator) but for any strange reason don't criticize PJ lyrics (receiver, deliver). Boring people... <br /> <br />3. Halo x Nothing's Impossible: WOW!!! Two fantastisc and dark DM songs! Halo is brilliant, but Nothing's Impossible is a bit more sentimental...  <br /> <br />4. Enjoy the Silence x Precious. If Precious was released in 1990, everybody would make this song as famous and simbolic as Enjoy the Silence is... Both are the same good... ETS is a bit \\"happier\\" and Precious is a bit more melancolic. But, both has sound and melody good at the same level... Am I wrong?  <br /> <br />5. Waiting for the Night x I Want it All. Two slow and calm songs. I Want it All has a romantic upgrade and a beautiful and (when Martin joins Dave).  <br /> <br />6. Policy of Truth x Suffer Well. Two danceable songs, with typical DM strong beat. Same level.  <br/> <br />7. Clean x Sinner in Me or The Darkest Star. Gosh!!! Clean is a great dark DM song, but how can we say that it is better than the envolving melody and the final beats of Suffer in Me?? Neither is better than the so monotone-style and rich-sounded Darkest Star. <br /> <br />Martin songs: <br /> <br />8. Sweetest Perfecetion x Macro. Okay, SP is better than Macro. But there is no doubt, Macro is severely underranter by several reviewers. Macro has a great chorus, with Dave suport. <br /> <br />9. Blue Dress x Damaged People. Blue Dress has more sounds and is more romantic, and Damaged People is more dramatic. Damaged Peple is another underrated song, few people has payed attention to its beautiful melody and emotion. Normally, is the same people who wants DM to make another Violator... <br /> <br />And PTA has still Lilian...  <br /> <br />The only problem that I see in Playing the Angel is the sequence of songs... Fisrt part: uplifiting songs, singles... Second part: slower and darker songs..  Another sequenced (mixing the two groups) would result in a better album for many people... and some 3 or 4-star reviewers probably would chance their opinion to 5=star.. <br /> <br />PLAYING THE ANGEL IS A AMAZING 5-STAR ALBUM. THANK YOU DM FOR THIS FANTASTIC JOB! And, for DM fans that criticized PTA... Let's look ahead!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FT2|5.0|An absolute immersion in a dark, stylish, troubling dimension. By listening to Nightclubbing you see immediately that Grace Jones is no ordinary singer. She has a natural genius and intuition to create an outstanding bunch of songs, that turn out to be not only a powerful album but also a striking and mind-blowing world by closing your eyes and listening closely to the lyrics. I highly recommend this CD, not for everyone but for those who are open minded because it's somewhat a really strange, groundbreaking album but without a doubt a very excellent album. This is of course my point of view, you sure can have yours. I will go track by track maybe to help you a little bit, who know... <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Walking In The Rain\\"- With this song you know exactly what to expect from this album. It's a dark, rhythmic ballad in the way of a monologue; it's really one of my favorite songs of Grace Jones. <br />Then there is \\"Pull Up To The Bumper\\"- This song fits more-or-less with the dark spirit of the album but it's none the less one of the finest track on the album. When I said something about listening to the lyrics you should read these ones before you sing them out loud, the whole song is filled with double intended words, you'll see what I mean if you read them... <br />\\"Use Me\\"- What a great track, the vocals of Grace are really for something, more than usual, in the chorus it's great. One of my favorites... <br />Then the title track \\"Nightclubbing\\"- There is only one word for this song; Haunting. All those little odd sounds that appear anytime in the song really haunt me! Darker than its original version from Iggy Pop the reinterpretation make it a highlight from the album. <br />\\"Art Groupie\\"- A really strange little song, seems really personal. Grace wrote it herself and it shows you really see a side of her personality in this song. Still its good but it looks like it's there to put a little waiting for THE height of the album: The next song... <br />\\"Libertango or (I've Seen That Face Before)\\"- Mind-blowing, fascinating, sexy and dramatic. Let Grace take you to our dark part inside that is reflected thru this song, where everything can happen... Truly a remarkable song in which she sing in English and put on some French, the best track for sure on the whole album and maybe in her whole career. \\"Tu cherches quoi rencontrer la mort? Tu te prends pour qui? Toi aussi tu dteste la vie...\\" simply great!!! <br />\\"Feel Up\\" follows next. - I didn't really hook up on this song, the weakest track on the album in my opinion of course  <br />\\"Demolition Man\\"- Great beat, great lyrics suited perfectly for Jones. It's one of my favorite songs on the album (I know, you are tired of hearing me saying: `It's my favorite', but I can't make my mind, it's too good to have only two favorites tunes!!!) <br />After the powerful start of the album and a totally outstanding height you can't expect what's next: \\"I've Done It Again\\" - A powerful ballad that shows that Grace in a more gentle and vulnerable way. It puts another height of the album and gives a very high note to finish this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Nightclubbing is surely one of my favorite album of all time, it just have it all. I just turned 16 years old and I say its way better than most of the music that people of my age listen to, why can't they put some Grace on the radio instead of noise considered as music... <br />Anyway... All in all it's simply a masterpiece                                                                                      <br />
0767800958|4.0|Plot weak. No Matter. WATCH THE DANCERS!!!!over and over.Here you wont see snaps of the head from R-----L & back like in the dance competitions on PBS. Watch older people do it. My dancing has become more fluid (IM  75 ) Thisis ARGENTINIAN TANGO  DANCED FOR FUN not for an award!
0553801503|3.0|I wanted so much to like this book more, but it just wasn't as good the previous novels.  Martin seemed to be ailing from the Robert Jordan Syndrome:  a large book with little to no real story or plot movement.  Even more annoying are the characters Martin chose to bring forward.  Supporting characters from the previous novels that brought nothing new to the overall story arc.  Returning characters were taken in directions that were unexpected and not enjoyable. I'm not sure what Martin was thinking with this novel.  Now, the book wasn't altogether disappointing.  The novel had its good points.  It was great to see Cersei come forward as a point-of-view character.  She was quite mad and made decisions that will have great repercussions for the future, but still a lot of fun. A Feast for Crows was not up to the same level as the previous novels in this series, but it's still worth reading.
B000008M54|5.0|It's hard to express what an album can mean to you. Although I have stacks of CD's, this is among the most cherished because it strikes a raw emotional chord in me that remains undiminished after years of listening. It ranks up there with Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\", Fleetwood Mac \\"Rumours\\", Cat Steven's \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" and Van Morrison's \\"Moondance\\".  <br />Why? Because there are very few albums that retain their artistic value over time; a truly great album weaves a tapestry, that goes beyond a quick hit and a bunch of filler.  <br /> <br />\\"Sweet Thing\\" is the best remake of a cover song I've ever heard - it soars. All of the songs leave you feeeling as if you've been on a journey. <br />I have decided that when I die, I want \\"When Ye Go Away\\" to be played at my funeral. It evokes an image of the sea, poignant farewells, and the haunting fiddle that is just slightly buried in the mix stirs something in me that nearly makes me weep, despite having heard it hundreds of times. This CD is so precious.
