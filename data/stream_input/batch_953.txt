0061864153|5.0|I purchased this for my Mother as a late birthday present since it was released a month after her birthday. She is a big time Bon Jovi fan. She goes to see them in concert at least once every tour, has just about every CD, DVD, etc. She LOVED this book. It is a very high quality and nice looking book. It is now sitting in a book stand and it looks very nice. Yes, a book stand. Have I mentioned that she is a big time Bon Jovi fan? ;-)

1416955070|4.0|Alright, I'll admit it. When I saw Stephanie Meyer's endorsement on the cover of the book, stamped right in the middle over the handsome Rune-covered chest, I was worried. I honestly can't stand the Twilight series (and I know there are people who want to disembowel me for saying so), and the attention Meyer's series has gotten baffles me. I expected something vaguely in the same realm--overblown, with poorly written characters and a shaky plot. In this case, I was very pleasantly surprised. Although the plotting is a little faulty and the pacing is lopsided at times, the book really is an enjoyable read.    Cassandra Clare brings us into her fantasy realm through a supposedly normal girl named Clary. Clary witnesses three Shadowhunters kill a very human-looking demon, even though \\"mundies\\" shouldn't be able to see demons or Shadowhunters. Then she's quickly pulled into the Shadowhunter world when her mother is kidnapped by a rogue Shadowhunter who is supposed to be dead. From there, the book expands outward into the world of Shadowhunters, Downworlders and demons, taking a few dips here and there to rescue a human-turned-rat and to find a wonderfully flamboyant warlock named Magnus. Clary finds herself not just in the Shadowhunters world, but a part of it, and she's able to bear the runes they wear without injury. These runes, carved into their bodies by an instrument called a stele, give the Shadowhunters strength, speed, and even healing capabilities.     To start off, Clary is not the most sympathetic or likeable character in the book. Her actions are usually brave but rash, and she's not always considerate of the people around her. Still, she's funny, intelligent and courageous, and she's piqued the interest of Shadowhunter Jace, who describes himself as \\"stunningly attractive.\\" And indeed he is, but he's also conceited and often cruel and thoughtless in his humor. Young girls are sure to love Jace, and he's indeed a much more reachable, flawed character than certain sparkly vampires we know. I do not always like Jace's actions, but this only makes me like him much more as an overall character.     That is one gift Clare has that other teen authors tend to overlook: the fleshing out of characters. A character like Jace could easily be turned into a beautiful, frustratingly perfect cardboard cut-out, but Clare's made sure to give him flaws, a personality, and weaknesses.     However, there are setbacks to Clare giving a personality and a back-story to each of her characters: She made a few of them too open with their pasts. The reader hears everything through Clary, which means that characters have to make startling confessions to Clary for us to have that information. Some people, like the warlock Magnus and the secretive Jace, don't seem like they'd open up quite so willingly to a near stranger.     Other characters include sibling Shadowhunters Alec and Isabelle, who look at Jace as a brother and fight alongside him. An interesting secret is revealed partway through the book about Alec, and I enjoyed this plotline very much. It's one that few other fantasy authors have incorporated into their stories in such a way.     There are certain points in the book that, although interesting, tend to slow the overall pace. Also, the information about the Shadowhunter world is thrown at the reader very quickly, and then revisited again later. This requires the reader to hold onto large scraps of information, some of which fall through the cracks. I enjoy fantasy writing very much, and never found the long descriptions dull. Other readers, though, might have trouble sifting through all of the heavy dialogue.    One of the only aspects of the book that really irked me was the use of similes and metaphors. I'm all for colorful description, which Clare provides in spades, but I grew very tired of the constant metaphors. Particularly because many of them seem to deal with cats--catlike grace, cat grin, cat speed, cat eyes, etc, etc. Others were poorly constructed, such as \\"It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways.\\" These similes grew tiresome after awhile. Still, the writing flows smoothly despite that, and I never found myself wanting to put the book down.     Jace and Clary's romance is as deeply aching as it is quick to begin, which is typical of Young Adult stories. I find it surprising that people complain about the relationship, since that's like complaining that vampires and magic exist in a fantasy novel. Young adults respond to this kind of love, as the Twilight saga proves. I enjoyed the chemistry between Jace and Clary, and the twist on their relationship at the end is at least a different take--if not an entirely comfortable one.     Clare's overall humor is one of the things that makes the book so enjoyable. Clare has stated that she's a fan of Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, and Buffy's influence is definitely noticeable in the ironic wit of Clare's central characters. The book also delves into matters like sex; City of Bones is not as squeaky clean as the Twilight series. This combined with the humor gives the book a darker, funnier edge.     The plot-twists are predictable; this book isn't for someone looking to be good and shocked. That goes for the other Mortal Instruments books as well. The supposed relation between two of the main characters continues throughout the second and third book, for example, which is frustrating because it's obvious that the two characters are not related. It leaves the reader feeling aggravated, wondering why the characters don't just pick up on it already. Still, the writing is smooth, the characters are fun, and the humor ties the whole thing up in a nice bow.     If you can be patient and you're not looking for a staggering work of heartbreaking genius (and you enjoy somewhat subtle references like that) then you'll like City of Bones. Its successors City of Ash and City of Glass build on the foundation that City of Bones sets down, andClare's writing really sharpens and improves with each one.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|This is my 2 yr old son's favorite movie (he likes it better than 1 & 2). This is a good value considering you get a Blue Ray Disc, a DVD and a Digital Copy of the movie. I would highly recommend to anyone with young children.
B002FA5NNW|5.0|It Said English Subtiles......Trust me there are no english subtiles.....anywhere to be found.....

B002BSHWUU|2.0|I just received the stereo box set as a Christmas gift and I am sadly disappointed.  First the bad news:<br /><br />Revolver CD:  Eleanor Rigby:  An earlier version from blue cover Yellow Submarine sounds better.  The Remastered 2009 sounds tinny and has a more separated left/right mix.  This results in a less fuller sound.  It actually sounds horrible.  Do these remastering engineers need hearing aids?<br /><br />Revolver CD:  Love You To: On the Remaster 2009 you can hear a sound glitch on the right side at 2 seconds in!  This is a horrible hatch job of remastering.  A better version is available from the blue cover Yellow Submarine which was obviously remastered with incredible care.<br /><br />Majical Mystery Tour CD: Flying:  The earlier version from original Maj Mystery Tour is better.  The Remaster 2009 Flying sounds distorted.  Much prefer the earlier version.<br /><br />Majical Mystery Tour CD:  I am the Walrus: Better remaster from Love CD.  A much more fuller sound on the Love CD.  The new Remastered 2009 I am the Walrus sounds thin.<br /><br />Help CD:  Help: Better remaster from Love CD.  The Love CD was superbly remastered with a more fuller sound on every song.  The new Remastered 2009 Help sound thin and certainly no improvement from the original.<br /><br />White Album CD:  Side by side listening test with headphones - couldn't tell any discernable differences - it sounds like the same exact mix from the original version released in the 1980's, with the exception of Blackbird:  Better remaster can be found from Love CD and original White Album CD.  On the new remaster, the first note is distorted!  This is a poorly done remaster.<br /><br />Good News:<br />Past Masters Disc 2 CD:  Across the Universe is the version from the album Rareties, which was previously unavailble on CD.<br />Please Please Me CD:  First CD issue of ; Misery and There's a Place in Stereo.<br /><br />Hard Days Night CD:  First issue of I Should Have Known Better in stereo.<br /><br />Sgt Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band CD.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|This movie is great; it's not a masterpiece but if you like scary movies that aren't super serious about themselves but really make an earnest attempt at succeeding at what they do, you should like this.<br /><br />The acting is pretty regular for a movie of this type. the special effects are ... very ... effective. The cinematography is awesome... it's a very good effort and it really shows you something new if you are looking for it.<br /><br />It can be a little forced and trite at some times, and certain characters are very flat and unbelievable... but the rest more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Will definitely scare and disgust the squeamish or easily disturbed. Probably won't scare the seasoned horror buff, but it's got some beautifully stomach turning sequences.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone.
B0020TS5KQ|5.0|First off, I like good movies with \\"guts\\" - i.e. - if you liked Armageddon (or most of the movies produced today) we are in two different worlds.  Chocolat is not a \\"girlie\\" movie.  It was very cleverly written and has great acting.  Dame Judith Dench was particularly outstanding (my favorite   movie of hers).  The blu-ray version is clear and vibrant.    Superlative movie in every way.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|I was really looking forward to a new cd from Norah Jones, but I really don't think \\"The Fall\\" is up to par with some of her other stuff.  usually when I buy a new cd of hers I wind up singing several of the songs over and over almost instantly.  Not so this time.
0763631205|5.0|This book is simply amazing. And I was impressed with Amazon's delivery service that really fast and reliable. I would recommend this book for anyone who need a charming book for their leisure time. A must have indeed.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I am very satisfied with the quality of the item and the quick turn around time to receive the item in time for the holidays.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I was trying to tell my friend that movies look better on a blu-ray; I don't think he believed me (sucks for him, cause picture is Amazing better on blu-ray).  Regardless, if you got looped into buying the HD TV...then the HD cables...then the HD player (blu-ray player or what I have PS3)...(& some cases the HD recievcer from whatever place you get TV from...I SWEAR someone made out like a bandit on this whole HD thing)...you mind as well get the blu-ray disc of All your favorite movies.      If your looking for more of a what is this movie is about review, then this is based on the comic book series under this same name.  The movie is pretty good (and so that probably means the comic book is better, becuase books into movies always have less value) and it has a perfect, if your different they will come for you, but V is there to help you feel.  At the end the moview also helps one believe that sooner or later the people will stand up for themselves when the governement is losing their mind.  It fit in with the current climate when the movie was made (as this was when Bush was doing all these wild and clearly illegal things and no said **** about it...).  Then agin, if you think Obama is losing his mind then you could just switch him in for the character running the governement and you'll be set.  Politics aside, this movie envisions what it is like to stand up for what you believe it when the governement wants you to shut the **** up.  I personally trhink the whole movie is worth V's confrontation at end with the government's men in the tunnel.  I won't tell you what happens, but be prepared for a good quote to tell someone if you every in that sort of situation.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|I bought this movie and received what I expected, a strange mix of political thought and perverse thought. I liked it but not for the message. I read the book that came with it and other reviews but I see this more as a chance for a director to act out on screen his fantasies and call it meaningful. I enjoyed it for what it was, a perverse little gem from the mind of a perverse man in the name of art. I can see social ties to a sick time in history, but only as an underlying thought. Great movie to have if you are a fan of bizarre cinema.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Saw this in theaters and decided within the first five minutes this is a film I needed! My expectations for the movie was over the top action scenes and I was impressed with all they fit in. A fun movie that has a bit of 80's action flare and characters that I grew up with. Glad to have this added to my collection and I look forward to the next movie!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Ignoring most babble in most comments:  In short, this was a great movie.  All the actors/actresses were at the top of their game.  In my opinion, it showed much of what was reality in the war and added fiction for the added seasoning of \\"what if\\".  Simply, just great art.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I have all their albums and this is by far my favorite. It's a nice mix up from what one would expect and I can understand why they didn't make the first album cut, and very thankful to hear it here. Neon Tiger is my new favorite song.
B002R68U7K|5.0|I'm a fan of Britney since 1999. I watched 2 of her Circus tour, one in Sydney (20th November 2009) and one in Melbourne (27th November 2009). I bought this Ultimate Single Collection on the 24th November 2009 and it arrived on 20th December 2009. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! Well, mainly because I'm a Britney fan :D The price it self is CHEAPER than if you have to buy it in Australia (between AUD$130 - AUD$190) ^^. The only downside is the waiting time to get the product on your hand :( but I'm willing to wait if I can get the product for $30-$90 less!!!
0307474275|2.0|Written to be a page turner with a lot of twists and turns.  Halfway through the book, I was thinking to myself \\"Holy Grail Batman, another riddle.  Do you think The Riddler's behind this?\\"<br /><br />So I got to the end of the book and find out what the Holy Grail is (don't worry, I won't spoil it).  But basically there is this Holy Grail, a long sought after treasure from Jesus Christ, who started Christianity. This Holy Grail, for over 2000 years, has been kept safe and protected by a group of pagans?  Wow, what a revelation, pagans protecting Christianity.  This book should be more of a shock to the ACLU than to the Catholic Church.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I have read numerous reviews which in part dictates my choice of movies. I have never had the time to write my own review, but since I am writing this one, tells you how disappointed I was when I watched District 9.    To be honest, I never got through the whole movie. To me, what's the point? I read other reviews and waited for this to come out on DVD, and then got the movie for Christmas. I was in high anticipation for this, but extremely let down.     I absolutely hated the biography, interview type format. In simple words, it is just a stupid movie. Special effects were okay, but this movie was slow moving, dragged on and on, and just plain didn't make sense. I have no idea how others can rate this film on pure entertainment.
B000026156|3.0|Let's face it: if you put Tony Braxton on your jazz CD, you're going to end up with some kind of musical ruckus, and Dave Holland certainly has that with his \\"Conference of the Birds\\". All in all, this is one of those free jazz masterpieces that, while definitely intense and casually interesting, it's not very musical and doesn't leave a lasting impression other than the vague hope that the musicians got as tired while recording it as the listener gets while listening to it. Without a doubt, I enjoyed listening to Dave's bass work, and I really liked the rhythm and percussion overall, but I remain distant in my understanding and appreciation of free jazz, and Mr. Holland did not succeed in bringing me any closer.
B000WC39SG|5.0|This is a realistic and good war movie. War is hell and it's good to see a battle that didn't in allied victory protrayed onscreen.  It makes you realize that like all wars that one could have been lost without alot of sacrifice. It's a sweeping movie and is historically accurate which is another plus. ON blu ray this movie looks better than ever , it could have been remastered probably though.  The colors restored and brought out more. However the print is a good one with no lines or blotches so at least that's a big plus.  Still any movie on blu should be restored ; especially a excellent true to life war story that reminds us that the even the best plans of war can go very wrong.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most amazing thing ever shown on television... and Amazon has the most amazing price on the DVD set.  A must have for any human of any age, Planet Earth is truly incredible.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|LOVE IT IT IS MICHAEL. THIS ONE HAD A FEW SONGS I DIDNOT HAVE ALREADY
B000LN7HUC|5.0|This is a great little stove for the outdoor minimalist. Purchase some denatured alcohol to go with the stove, and you have everything you need to cook small meals along the trail. I've boiled water with my mini Trangia in heavy snow and winds...no problem, just warm the fuel a little. I own faster stoves, including a Jetboil, but I personally prefer the Trangia for its simplicity in construction and relatively cheap fuel source. It's a bit more \\"hands on\\" than other stoves as there are no control valves or igniters to control or extinguish the flame, but I'm comfortable working with the Trangia; actually I'm more comfortable around this type of stove than the newer gas stoves. The Trangia system is a solid stove that is widely used and time proven. I'm very happy with mine.
B001LYD2JU|5.0|You haven't heard this album until you've heard this version!  I had the U.S., the Japanese, and the prior British remaster--none of them compare to the perfection of sound finally achieved on this version.  Even the lp never sounded this good.  The clarity of the instruments is astonishing.  Schenker is my favorite guitarist, but I was never totally blown away by this album--until now.      I bought all of the first four MSG studio album remasters, which were done by the same person who also recently did the amazing UFO remasters.  In my opinion, they are equally good.  In fact, the recent MSG and UFO re-releases are probably the best \\"remasters\\" I have ever heard (and I have a lot), as well as the best music purchases I have made in a very long time.
B00000099Y|5.0|The roller coaster ride of this album impressed me from the second I bought it and now 10 years later it still grips me.  The whole album is an undulating roller coaster of emotions about the clash between what pop culture is trying to feed you and what you accept.  If you haven't heard it, listen to it a few times and don't skip around listen start to finish.  You'll be surprised at how well the album melds together and paints a clear picture as a whole.
B001FB55LW|5.0|Great movie, good plot, emotion roller coaster, happy ending...What else could a movie need?<br />It even has Jim Carey and Zooey Deschanel in it as an added bonus! ^_^
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Fast delivery and no hassels which is great given that it was so close to Christmas time already!
B002FOQY2M|4.0|Fans of lead singer Nate Ruess' former band The Format will not be disappointed, and those new to his songwriting and vocal styles shouldn't be, either. \\"Aim and Ignite\\" is, simply put, one of the finest pop albums of the year, and certainly one of the strongest debuts of a new band in recent memory. There's a lot to enjoy here, from the melodic, orchestral \\"Be Calm,\\" which would fit right in as the opening number of a stage musical, all the way to the finale track \\"Take Your Time (Coming Home),\\" a seven-minute opus that's over in a blur. Other stand-out songs are \\"Benson Hedges,\\" \\"All the Pretty Girls,\\" and \\"At Least I'm not as Sad (as I Used to be).\\" Definitely worth picking up.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Great movie as almost everybody knows but picture quality wasn't as good as I thought it should be. Don't get me wrong, def looks better then the SD version but not the best PQ in BD i've ever seen. Sound Quality was decent, definitely cleaner if your setup decodes the new HD audio formats but even then, its not as good as some other sound tracks I've heard before. I don't think anybody will doubt how great of a movie it is, just PQ/SQ thought could be better!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|No argument that this is a great movie. Unfortunately, the blu-ray (sapphire series) quality is a horrible end product to watch in comparison to other blu-ray movies on the market. This needs to be fixed. A shame, waste of money for the quality you expect to get from blu-ray video.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Good delivery time, in time for Christmas and was ordered last minute.  Great condition-brand new in package.
B000UFAURI|3.0|I have long been a fan of the Foo Fighters, primarily because of the fun and energy of their live performances. I enjoy their songs well enough, but have always found their individual albums mixed bags of great songs and lots of so-so ones. ESP&G is no exception to this rule and in fact seems more mixed in results than ever.<br /><br />The opening tracks, \\"The Pretender\\" and \\"Let It Die\\", are quite promising for what's to come. Full of energy and extremely catchy, with plenty of loud/soft contrasts that leave the listener engaged and excited. \\"Erase/Replace\\" keeps up the high energy but starts to feel a little monotonous and flat in comparison to the first two tracks. Next up is \\"Long Road To Ruin\\", a kind of classic radio-friendly Foo song along the lines of \\"Learn To Fly\\" but...it feels as though they are running over well-tread and not-so-interesting ground this time around. I grew to like this song more on repeat listenings, but it's never going to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />Two softer tracks follow, \\"Come Alive\\", which eventually builds some steam towards the end but I found boring after a few too many repeated listenings. I liked \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\" better, a track which could have easily fit on the acoustic disc of \\"In Your Honor\\" but is soft without being sappy.<br /><br />It's after this that the album really stalls for me. The best thing about \\"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\\" is definitely its title; the song itself sounds like any other forgettable pop-rock act out there on the radio. \\"Summer's End\\" fails to really hook into its lazy, folk-rock groove and the instrumental guitar track \\"Ballad Of The Beaconsfield Miners\\" just feels completely out of place and like nothing more than filler.<br /><br />Things get better for the end, however. I loved \\"Statues\\" a lot at first, even though it sounds very little like the Foos and more as though Dave Grohl is channeling Wings. Even so, the song got a bit tiring to me after repeated listens, a bit of a one-trick pony. \\"But, Honestly\\" returns to the good power of the album's opening tracks, that great mixture of melody and driving rock that I enjoy the most about the Foos. Lastly is \\"Home\\", a very pretty ballad and not a bad note to end the album on.<br /><br />All in all, it's hard to rate this album overall as it feels so very disjointed in sound, energy and styles. It's almost as if the Foos had a few great songs to start and were scraping around and stabbing out in odd directions to fill up the rest. It left me wondering whether the band as a whole was just running out of creative steam - certainly hearing the power and fun Grohl is having currently with Them Crooked Vultures has lead me to revisit these thoughts and questions about the Foos and this album.<br /><br />So basically I'd rate ESP&G as \\"just ok\\" and only of real interest to already devoted fans. Those looking to get into the Foos for the first time should look instead to their earlier work.y. \\"But, Honestly\\" returns to the good power of the album's opening tracks, that great mixture of melody and driving rock that I enjoy the most about the Foos.

B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|Recibí este disco el 24 de diciembre. No pudo haber mejor regalo!!! Ya todos conociamos el disco Time Out. Pero el segundo disco es simplemente sorprendente. Buena calidad de audio a 50 años de haberse grabado. El DVD no tiene mucho que ofrecer, pero para quien no conoce a Dave Brubeck puede resultar interesante.   Sin duda lo mejor del Box Set es el disco 2. Fué una excelente compra.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Much more than a kids movie this movie is a heartbreaking yet heartwarming story about loss. It takes you on one mans journey through love, loss and moving on. Truly touching. Still enjoyable for the whole family, just small kids won't understand everything the movie actually says.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|El disco es genial. Desde que fué grabado por primera vez no ha sido necesario decir mas de el. Escuchar el disco 2 con las grabaciones de BB King y Tina Turner vale mucho la pena. Es genial. Sin embargo el DVD no tiene mucho que ofrecer. Realmente por el precio se espera más material.   Vale la pena, pero hubieran considerado poner mas material en el DVD.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I decided to put in my two cents' worth also:    First of all, many forget that Sting is a troubadour, i.e. a singer of stories and in doing so, trying to evoke moments that will transport people to forgotten places of one's soul. I don't think he will ever lay credit to being the best classically trained musician in ancient vocal and/or music techniques. His job is to evoke and on that he delivers egregiously.    The album also informs the public that Christmas/Winter is not always the merriest of seasons. It can be long, hard, dark and drawn-out for many inhabitants of the Northern Hemisphere who do not lead privileged lives. Although I now live in the comfort of the States, I do remember the dark, cold mornings of my youth and the long, freezing, nights when a fire or charcoals were the only thing to warm up a room or a bed chamber, hey, and I've just turned forty, so that was not very long ago! People were cut off from travel, from doing chores properly, from gathering and it became a period of introspection and expectation and of survival as well. Firewood needed to be cut and last the season, food needed to be organized, since trips to the markets became difficult and sporadic at best, cars had to be primed for freezing temperatures and one could always get lost in mountain blizzards. Some died on occasion. Everything and everyone slowed down.  It is difficult to put into words the motions of one's existence in such circumstances, but Sting did it with this Album.   The mood, the music and the delivery is stark, rustic and haunting.    From the moment \\"Gabriel's Message\\" dissonant chords hit my CD player, this album became a winner.    What a Gem in a Winter's night. The Ancient, the Stories, the Longing, the Melancholy, the Remembrance, the Hope and the Meditation.  You'll find it here.  No Commercials.    Not for the easy peasy listner with no historical and ethnic music appreciation and not for the superbly professional perfectionist.
B002RVZV9U|3.0|I just watched \\"It Might Get Loud\\", a film by Davis Guggenheim (who also created Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", a delicious slice of Grade A Propaganda if you ever get the chance!)  It's a profile of three contemporary guitarists: Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White. Each speak about their creative process, technique and influences.  The film looks great and held my attention but the same thought kept recurring...nothing against Jack White but why Jack White?  There are any number of others I would have preferred to see (Dick Dale, Robbie Robertson, Richard Thompson, Lindsey Buckingham, Joe Satriani), all who have far more history than Jack White.  Hopefully this will spark an interest in getting more of this kind of thing made, think Peter Gabriel, Tom Waits, Bowie, Byrne, and on and on.  These artists are only on this planet for a finite period of time.  It would be interesting to see how they work.  In summary, if you appreciate the work of these artists or if you just like guitars, you'll enjoy this film.  3/5
076781326X|3.0|I don't own this item, but I see in the product description that it has 2-sided discs. I own a TV series season that is on 2-sided discs, and I will tell you right now that they STINK. 2-sided disks get damaged with scratches very quickly no matter how careful you are with them. First of all, there's wrestling to get them off the thing they're attached to. This scratches the side that's against the case wall.<br /><br />While you're working to get the DVD out of the case, it's pretty unavoidable to get the skin oil from your fingers on the DVD's face-up surface at least a little. And, what about women who have nails beyond their fingertips? Mine aren't even very long, and they still get dangerously close to causing damage.<br /><br />It also puts stress on the disc itself as you bend it repeatedly while working to get it off the thing that fastens it to the case wall. The repeated bending doesn't cause immediate issues, but it does over time. I got Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 7 used from Blockbuster for Christmas, and only one of the discs skips; however, there is no sign of scratches on the disc, and the disc doesn't have any fan-favorite episodes on it. It's just wear and tear...and with that disc it's just from bending, not from being double-sided.<br /><br />Back to the 2-sided discs, they are just NOT good things.

0920668372|5.0|GREAT book.  Came recommended by my daughters preschool teacher at a book fair.  Details the true connection between a mother and her child.
0439023483|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book at first. The book jacket didn't sound all that appealing to me, but I had heard good things about it so I bought it. I am so glad I did! This is one of the best books that I've read in a really long time. I think this book is appropriate for adults as well as young adults/teens.  I am an adult who honestly felt a little bit sheepish reading this YA book, but the content and writing style doesn't feel childish in the least.  I found myself so absorbed in the world of Katniss that hours would pass and I didn't even take notice. I would recommend not to read this book (or the second, Catching Fire) unless you have some free time to devote to just reading. I cannot wait for the the third book to come out to finish up this trilogy. Now I'm off to hunt for books similar to this one to hold me over until August!
B002PEP4HI|5.0|I am not sure how I came to reading this book but I took the free chapter review and I could not put it down.  I ended up reading the whole book in one night.  I was so moved by this story that I actually cried.  I highly recommend this book to everyone. We all truly need a little faith. Thank you Mr Alborn for sharing your story.  Happy New Year everyone!
0307454541|1.0|This book did not meet the expectations I had for it. The characters were difficult to identify with, the plot was too slow and drawn-out. There were spots in the middle where I was skipping around just to see if there was anything to look forward to.  I struggled to finish it, and wasn't even all that satisfied with the ending once I finally got there. Many other mystery/thrillers surpass this book in terms of plot and character development. I wouldn't waste my time with this one, but there are obviously plenty of readers who've enjoyed it too, so buy it if you dare, but don't say no one warned you!
B0000CD5I6|3.0|Well you can add another half star at least, as for the pretty aspects of classical music and prog folk as well, in the tradition of the solo albums composed by Ian Anderson...Actually the present album is not equal for instance to \\"Divinities\\", but it's a good performance anyway; and of course it's strange that's a Jethro Tull album! The Christmas lyrics aren't so bad and the music is versatile enough...ok forget \\"Locomotive Breath\\" or \\"Aqualung\\" here, but naturally it's a Christmas Album and not a rock performance! Nevertheless the mood is right and the music gentle, sometimes in the vein of Rupi's Dance, not properly a swing album (regarding of a work dated 2003, however issued this way in the recent times), but I should say it's a kind of soft version or more \\"light jazzy\\" version of \\"Songs from the wood\\"...The instrumental numbers are always in the pretty tone of the sacred celebration of Christmas and that's coherently in accordance to such Ian's tradition, who likes to run the old path of the \\"classics\\" and without screaming...so this time there's no rock music in the J.T. composition and it's not a problem...at the end it could be worth a listen, once again!

B000PKX2KA|5.0|I bought this a month ago and had a chance to really test it out on a short weekend trip recently.  The GPS worked seamlessly with my map software and tracked my car down the highway.  When I was sitting still, it isn't deadly accurate.  My altitude would change by 10 ft up or down and my exact spot would move around a lot but when I was moving down the highway it tracked me right down the road.  It had my speed and altitude in the mountains and held on to the satellite signal.  It was very quick to get a lock on satellites also.  I was locked up again within seconds of exiting tunnels in the mountains.  It is a great little gadget for a casual user who doesn't want to spend $300 on a GPS navigator.<br /><br />Edit: I have popped several tubes on these since I wrote this.  I go for gatorskins.  No problem with those.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|\\"Up\\" is arguably the best movie of any kind for 2009, and, in a year that included \\"9\\", \\"Coraline\\" and \\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\\", it's arguably the best animated film of the year. The packaging of this version included the DVD, the Blu-Ray and computer viewable disks, all for about the price of a DVD. The extra features include a semi-documentary of the animators traveling to the location in South America in which most of the movie is set. Who would have believed that fantastic scenery is actually real?! One warning, the first ten minutes or so recap the lives of Carl Fredericksen and his friend, then wife, Ellie from about age 10 up to Ellie's death. That's right she starts as a charming, adventurous 10 year-old and ends up a dead senior citizen in the first reel. It's done tastefully, but it's a tear-jerker, and may be too much for younger children. Also, the villain of the piece isn't explicitly killed at the end, but it's hard to imagine he survives his final scene.
B00288KNL8|5.0|one of the best stop action movies i have seen in a long time. Definately worth the purchase, especially when you can bring the 3D right in your into your home tv. Awesome movie that did get the time and attention it deserved
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I want to say that the bonus 38 minute press conference was very enjoyable but the nearly half hour of bonus scenes was easily worth the price for me...Jimmy Page sitting in a room ala Robert Johnson and strumming an acoustic! Page again..strumming the riffs of \\"Friends\\" on an old acoustic, playing on a National....and TEACHING the others how he developed \\"Kashmir\\"...WOW...and there is much more...    Since this isn't a movie review but a DVD review....these bonus features add tremendously to the value for me of a DVD that contains a very fun and interesting film. I love guitar, have been playing it for 40 years and sure...I'd have liked to have seen other songs played, questions asked, but am I glad they made this...YES, am I glad I have it to watch whenever I want...absolutely. I respect Jack White and The Edge but Jimmy Page is an icon of icons for me in the guitar world and any footage of him a treasure.    I'm sorry I missed it on the big screen but am thrilled to own this DVD!
0618154248|5.0|I absolutely adore this box set. It was purchased as a gift for my toddler when she was about 14 months old. The books range in complexity from the very simple \\"Curious George Rides\\" to the more detailed \\"Curious George Goes Fishing.\\" When we first opened the box set, my daughter could only sit through the most simple book, but now she is able to listen to 3 out of the 4 without getting too wiggly. She loves George and makes her monkey sounds when she wants me to read it to her. These are definitely among her very favorite books.

Didn't complain about anything in the movie!!  Well done!!
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|\\"Up\\" is an outstanding motion picture; and it earned the honor of being the first animated 3D film to open the Cannes Film Festival. No wonder, too--the story is endearing with lots of action depicting the classic struggle of good versus evil; the animation is the best I've ever seen and the voiceovers leave nothing to be desired. The plot moves along very nicely with good character development and the action works very well alongside the tender message of the film that left me with a tear in my eye. Indeed, \\"Up\\" will remain one of the finest animated films of all time because it deals with so many universal issues and themes we think about in life--friendship, loyalty, love, the struggle of good versus evil and the desire to make your biggest dreams come true.<br /><br />The film starts with us meeting two young kids, Carl and Ellie who worship their childhood idol, South American explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Carl and Ellie play together as kids and they grow up to be sweethearts and marry, too.  They are happy together; but their childhood dream of going to Paradise Falls where Charles Muntz discovered bones from an exotic bird never gets accomplished. Muntz has long since returned to Paradise Falls after he was labeled a fraud back home; he told reporters when he left again for South America's Paradise Falls that he will bring back the actual bird dead or alive to prove his discovery was real but he never returned.<br /><br />With time, Ellie and Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) become elderly and Ellie passes away. Carl's house is forever being threatened by new construction; and the court orders him to live at Shady Oaks nursing home after Carl accidentally hits construction worker Steve (voiced by Danny Mann) with his mailbox! Carl also meets a young wilderness explorer, Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). Carl devises a successful plan to have his house float away to Paradise Falls using helium balloons; but after taking off, Carl soon discovers that Russell is along for the ride!<br /><br />Of course, there's much, much more to the plot with action and heartrending scenes that really are memorable. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much away. Suffice it to say that Carl does get to South America with Russell where they meet Kevin, a rare bird that loves chocolate and Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson), an incredibly sweet golden retriever. Unfortunately, however, there are some other animals that are not exactly friendly; and this causes huge problems after their other encounter with the now elderly and rather evil Charles Muntz.<br /><br />This two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. We get an animated short entitled \\"Partly Cloudy;\\" \\"Adventure Is Out There;\\" \\"Dug's Special Mission;\\" an optional running commentary with co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson--and more! The second DVD lets you access the digital copy and the digital copy code is provided with the artwork inside the DVD case.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" just couldn't be better; the film leaves nothing to be desired. This two DVD set may not be in Blu-ray; but the quality of the picture is very, very good; I am invariably impressed by the fine animation from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures but this time they really outdid themselves!

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|After playing this new CD I can tell that this is not the same Alicia Keys from the past. She have changed the style that has define her, showing everybody that she still got poetic lyrics but, in a new sound. You won't regret buying this CD.
1589946006|5.0|As advertised this included 6 mega-Cthulhu and 24 mini-Cthulhu, each with the identical design and detailing.<br /><br />I use these with [[ASIN:B000ALCC5K Arkham Horror]] in place of the game's \\"doom tokens\\" since they are a lot more stylish and Arkham Horror is set in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very affordable at a per-miniature level<br />- Pre-painted with good detailing<br />- Durable<br />- Mini-Cthulhu are handy as tokens for Arkham Horror or other games<br />- Mega-Cthulhu are handy as decorations or sinister paperweights<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not sure how easy it would be to paint it for those of you who like custom painting things. This is a plastic mini with an olive base and black detailing.<br />- The bag arrived torn open in the Amazon box. No pieces were lost or damaged, but be aware that packaging might not be the normal high-quality level used by Amazon.<br /><br />Definitely recommend, particularly if you're playing Arkham Horror or any tabletop game remotely Cthulhu related.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Yes, little Susan, there is a Santa Claus . . . and in this movie he's pretending to be the actor Edmund Gwenn just so he can bring a little Christmas joy to the world.<br /><br />Made in the rosy flush of victory after World War II, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET is a wonderfully optimistic film. Santa's kindliness to a little Dutch refugee girl tugs at the heartstrings. And that is only one of many scenes.<br /><br />Maureen O'Hara (Doris) a divorced single Mom, is coordinator of the venerable Macy*s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Forced to find a last-minute replacement for a snockered St. Nick she hires the real Santa Claus. Of course, nobody really believes that he's the one and only Kris Kringle, but he does, and what's more important, by the end of the movie, so do we.<br /><br />Mr. Kringle has to suffer through the indignity of a committment hearing (which he wins in an \\"it-could-only-happen-in-New York City\\" manner), but his greatest victory is convincing the cynical Doris and her disbelieving six year old (played by Natalie Wood) that imagination is just another form of reality.<br /><br />This Special Edition has three versions of the film. The original b&w 1947 version and the colorized 1980 version are packaged with a 1950's edited-for-TV version (which somehow I remember seeing in the early 1960s). Thank heavens it DOES NOT have the more recent remake.<br /><br />No matter what version you decide to watch (I recommend the 1947 original), nothing outshines this happy film.
B000TCEU4Q|3.0|Simply put, after retarding throttle, prop, or mixture levers in FSX or FS2004 and then pushing them back up to max, the simulator never reads them as fully maxed out.  So after you pull back the power after takeoff, pushing it all the way up only gets you about 80% max throttle.  Same for prop control and mixture.  I am a Real Pilot with my own airplane and use FS to practice instrument flying(approaches, etc).  This may seem like a small issue to some but it detroys the simulation in terms of power settings and aircraft performance.  When I recalibrated, windows shows the axes as properly calibrated but FS does not.  I sent it back disappointed.
B000F3UAFC|1.0|Okay, let's just ignore the fact that this is a brilliant play by Oscar Wilde that these producers mistakenly thought they had the intelligence and talent to alter (yes, they did! yes, it is outrageous! can you believe - yes! exactly! i know what you mean!) and start right in with the fact that this film exposes the limits of both Scarlett's and Helen's acting ability to a great and lamentable degree. (In what universe, I ask, would anyone believe that a Mrs. Erlynne could in any way resemble or behave like Helen Hunt?) The rest of the cast are wonderful but can't save this drowning ship, which pairs Wilde's brilliant sayings with only average story-telling ability. The soundtrack of kitschy versions of swing was so forgettable I don't believe I even saw recognition in the credits for it. And the moment I heard said kitschy swing music turn to what I believe to be Puccini's Madame Butterfly, I was through. With all of the great period movies out there, there is no point on wasting one's time with this one.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|This DVD has several deleted scenes and insightful director's commentary. The deleted scene with Niecy Nash as a flight attendant is delightful. As far as the film, it is entertaining and easy to watch. It is one of Sandra Bullock's good ones.
B0000524CY|5.0|I remember watching scenes from this movie when i was around 9 years old and closing my eyes really tight and plugging my ears. My brother which was maybe 18 at the time knew how afraid i was of this movie and one time recorded her voice onto a tape recorder and placed it under my bed. When i went to bed he played it and i got out of bed crying, he got into so much trouble for that. I'm now 34 and this is the only film ever created which is truly terrifying to me. I cannot hear her voice or see her face, because it's an image or sound i cannot easily erase from my mind. We're adults now and it's a bit funny thinking back on it, but this film is one of my brothers favorites ... he has a magazine clipping of the Exorcists picture and not too long ago showed it to me when i wasn't expecting it and i ran out of the house screaming, (neighbors must have thought i was crazy). He still gets a kick out of it, although it was a good laugh for everyone. I tried watching it all the way through several years ago, but still covered my eyes and my ears ... anything having to do with demonic possession is just scary. This is one that is not easily forgotten.

B002LW9ITY|5.0|Got this as a present for my nephew and he fell in love with it, amazing gift
B002PMV9FG|1.0|This is by and far the worst movie from a book that I have ever seen. Let us forget that this is a hugely popular hit series in book and movie form as a stand alone film I felt robbed of my money and my time. I will not spoil anything, but understand this, MAJOR plot points are just skipped. If they made the movie for people that read the books and knew what was going on, and didn't really want to see the things happen on the big screen, the succeeded. This huge failure succeeds at making me want to get rid of the entire series it is so horrible. Major scenes were missing, and one major event was made to be so lack-luster, that I actually laughed out loud. When the film was over, my wife even went, \\"That's it?\\" Yes dear, that is the end of 2 and 1/2 hours of the worst rendition of a book to film. Now, do not tell me how movies and books differ, I understand that. But to complete omit major story points is completely unforgivable. And, if you are going to give me 150 minutes of film, do not add things that are not in the story and have nothing to do with the series. Actually, one complete waste of celluloid contradicts the series in a 5 minutes fight scene that is, well, not there in the books. The added scene even creates an issue for the next film. I had to explain everything that \\"really\\" happened to my wife, who was left completely clueless as to what was going on because this film says nothing about the real story. Just because it says Harry Potter, do not think that the entire world is going to invest their monies into your product. Stephen King made that mistake with his Dark Tower series. Improve these mistakes in the next film, or you will completely lose your audience before the summer of 2011 when the final film is released. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE!
0345308239|4.0|About the book:<br />This is Barbara Tuchman's book on the Viet Nam war, although this is only hinted at in the title.  The book begins with an interesting chapter that defines folly, as a policy in that is contrary to self-interest.  The next chapter is on the wooden horse of the Trojan War, and why the Trojan's, contrary to their self- interest and with many warnings, took it into the city and precipitated their doom.  This chapter is meant to focus on the idea that to be truly folly there must be a rational different choice (in this case not to take the horse into the city or at least to see what was inside of it).  It also focuses on another idea that true folly is something that is clearly warned against, but that these warnings are unheeded.<br /><br />The book then has two multi-chapter sections; one on the Renaissance Popes and the other on the British loss of America.  The Renaissance chapter shows the papacy as an organization that was not focused on Christianity; rather these Popes were more focused on gaining power, personal aggrandizement and the use of the papacy to promote family interests.  There was a sense that the church was too strong to fail so no changes were made in spite if many calls for change. The American Revolution section focused on the folly of British policy towards America.  Again many voices were raised in opposition to these policies, but they were not heeded because of a complete lack of understanding of the colonists and the situation existing in the colonies, the feeling that victory was inevitable, and finally a complete lack of understanding that it was impossible to sustain what were shown to be misguided policies.<br /><br />The preceding is, in my opinion, mostly supporting material for the last section (occupying about 40% of the book), which deals with the American involvement in Viet Nam.  (I am using involvement instead of war because the section starts before America started fighting and ended after almost all the American troops had left.)  Being written in 1985, only 12 years after the end of this involvement, it is largely colored by the passion that this conflict generated.  History has become somewhat more nuanced since then, but the overwhelming opinion still supports her contention that American policy was one of folly, as defined by the preceding chapters of the book.<br /><br />My opinion:<br />This is not Barbara Tuchman's best book.  I do not think that it is on the same level as \\"The Guns of August\\", but few book are.  In my opinion, while interesting, the Renaissance and American Revolution sections suffer because they provide a lot of detail, but do not provide a complete picture of these events.  They were not meant to be comprehensive, but were only to highlight aspects of folly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, much more detail was provided than was necessary.  I feel that this was a case where more was definitely less in that the concentration on details, some of which I felt were extraneous and detracted from the overall thesis of the book.  Instead of being about 100 pages each, I think that these sections would have been better, more focused, if they were only about 20 pages.  As it is, I felt that things were a bit repetitive and after a while I found myself racing through these sections, and this caused me to give the book four stars instead of five.  I would have preferred more examples relating to different events.  More importantly, the detail provided in these sections tended to focus me onto the specifics of events, rather than on the general question of folly.  The same is true, only more so, of the Viet Nam chapters.<br /><br />This book has a lot to teach us about folly and why governments and people support folly, but I would have liked more examples and more general discussion.  I fear that focusing on only a few examples and mostly on one in particular, gives one the false impression that folly is limited and can be avoided.  Folly did not end withViet Nam, nor is it limited to the policies of any one nation; it is endemic to all and must be guarded against by all.  Unfortunately, as noted in the Epilogue this plea has never been headed, so nations are condemned to fall in step with the march of folly.s of any one nation; it is endemic to all and must be guarded against by all.  Unfortunately, as noted in the Epilogue this plea has never been headed, so nations are condemned to fall in step with the march of folly.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I just bought the 7506s to compare them with the Shure SRH840s I also bought.  I needed cans that could be used with a variety of audio gear--sound board monitoring of line in and mic, laptop, portable CD player (no MP3s, thank you), home system, and ham radio.  The radio gives these cans a real workout, just like they do the 840s, when I'm trying to pull faint signals out of the ether, but I love both sets.  Right now it's a toss up: the 840s are noticeably heavier, and I'll use them more for quiet listening and for studio work; the 7506s will get used as I move around the radio gear and laptop late at night working distant stations.

And though I'm not opposed to such meanderings, in the confines of this work they only seemed served to derail the story for me.<br /><br />I liked Shadow, a few of the other characters, and the general story-line of the book kept me pressing forward.  However, the sum of these parts do not equal the whole.<br /><br />To top it off, the show-down that we were being led up to was so anti-clamatic it was sad.  I'm sure there was some deep hidden meaning in that non-event and I just missed it.  Heck, there was probably some shallow overt message there but I missed that too.  I probably missed alot of the meaning in this book, due, in large part, to my lack of engagement with the story.<br /><br />And I never really understood the importance/meaning of the secret the bucolic town of Lakeside, WI was harboring.<br /><br />This is my 3rd, and probably last, dance with Gaiman.  I'm sure there is an audience for his material but it doesn't include me. And I'm also pretty sure that the fault is me and not Gaiman - his style/stories are just not what get me jazzed.<br /><br />Gaiman fans enjoy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Thank you Susan Boyle for sharing such a wonderful talent with the rest of the world.      You have brought great pleasure and inspiration to so many.    Thanks also to all those that worked to bring her talent to the marketplace.    For me it is nice to listen to an artist who has a talent that can stand on its own and doesn't have to yell over, and compete with, the loud background music that so many of our young artist are bringing to the market today.    Please share more with us in the future. I know the USA is not your country but I would love to hear you sing our National Anthem sometime.
B00080Z53O|5.0|This is an excellent movie, and deservedly so, as it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2004.  Javier Bardem is phenomenal.  Very moving, based on a true story.  In Spanish with subtitles.
B002HWUU2C|4.0|My wife and I are huge Swell Season fans and listened to the first CD over and over. We saw Once, bought it for about 10 people, saw them in concert. You can call us fans.    This release (limited deluxe) is nice because it includes a live cd and live dvd and a nice liner booklet with lyrics. But the music just isn't quite as good as the first disc they released.     We've listened through twice and really like it, but it doesn't resonate as much as the first album. It is still very much worth listening to.
1423107233|5.0|God, words cannot express how excited I am for the rest of the series if this book is any indication of quality.<br /><br />When I pulled this out of a box, I was thrilled already - this book is thick, hardcover, and looks every bit worth the money you spent on it. Opening the book is no exception. I'm an artist and not looking for books full of text, (hint who people do not draw: usually there isn't a process that can be typed out and explained nicely) - I was looking for a book like this. Straight up, this is colour storyboards in an oversized format. It fits nicely in my lap, and everyone who picks up this book fawns over it.<br /><br />There's a nice variety in style and technique, some are labours of love in full colour - others are scribbled with a pencil. The reproductions are AWESOME.<br /><br />My only quibbles<br /> - Clearer credit to the known artists could be given, although I understand especially in the earlier films this wasn't always possible and IMDB can usually be used to clear it up.<br />- Some of the storyboards are quite abrupt and they are a bit short (but this book is HUGE as it is, so I don't know how that could be rectified.<br />- A few pages open up into huge fold outs, and while this is gorgeous and appreciated - it's really easy to not catch them because they almost seal themselves with the weight of the book. And I've had my big lovely book almost rip on these pages a few times. It's gorgeous, but awkward<br />.<br />I'm studying animation - this book is an amazing, invaluable reference. Buy it now, because it's bound to turn into an expensive classic. I look forward to the next editions!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I gave this movie as a Christmas present this year and was lucky enough to watch it as well. This is possibly the best romantic comedy ever made. It seems scientifically engineered to contain something for everyone. You've got unrequited love, interracial romance, political elements, exotic locales, older couples, adultery, complex family commitments, attractive American women, lobsters, nudity for the guys. I've watched this with dozens of people and everyone loves it. It's a go to Christmas movie for adults who need something more than Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation.
B001IC0I7E|4.0|This book starts out with lots of superfluous description of people and places that never ties up or is relevant to the tale.  The story takes quite a bit of time to get off the ground.  The story line is textbook predictable.  You know who the bad guy(s) are before they are introduced.  As they say in the trade \\"it is the last person you would suspect.\\"<br /><br />Now for the positives.  After a slow start the action finally starts to move.  If you think it has holes that you could fly a jet through, maybe but if it did not you would have no story.  One thing people enjoy in books is things they already know about.  With Tony Hillerman it is Navaho culture.  With Stephen King it is spookiness based on standard premises.  This book also bases its suspense on existing conspiracies weaving current events into age-old mysteries.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|While I enjoyed the theatre version of Kingdom of Heaven, the director's cut is far and away much the better tale, filling in many blanks that are in the original version Ridley Scott was forced to cut the movie down to. As a matter of fact, after seeing a friend's uncut version, I simply could not watch the theatre version ever again ... it is to cut up! If you like Kingdom of Heaven, you will LOVE Kingdom of Heaven Uncut!!!!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I am a fan of Harry Potter so I was so looking forward to this movie when it came out on DVD to add to my collection.  Sorry to say I found it to be a very disappointing watch.  The story line made no sense to me and left so many loose ends which can only be tied up by another Harry Potter book/movie, which I hear there won't be.  I for the first time felt I wasted my precious time watching it.  In fact a couple days later I thought maybe it was me so I watched it again, it isn't me, the movie stinks.  I am truly sorry that I didn't rent it before I bought it, but then again it only cost $9.99 with the war going on between Walmart, Amazon and Target at the time.  If you don't need it for anything other than to add to your collection, don't bother as I think you also will be disappointed.

B002RVZV9U|2.0|As an amateur guitarist with a broad appreciation of rock music spanning every generation, I naturally found the concept of this film intriguing.  As for the three guitarist in this film, I would only consider myself a fan of Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin.  I like a number of U2 songs, but I would no way call myself a die hard.  As for Jack White, I am pretty familar with the White Strips and the Raconteurs, like some of his licks, but have always thought he was pretty overrated as a guitarist.  The fact that RS ranked him #17 all-time Guitarist is insane.  Anyways, as for the movie.  It lacked a lot of actual substance.  As much as I like Page, he was rather uninteresting and revealed very little about himself.  The Edge was disappointingly dull as well, in addition, he basically admits that his expensive gear gives him all of his sound, not his surprisingly lack-luster playing ability .  Jack White is the only guy who seems interesting or at least interested in the project.  Though, through his awkward \\"Age 9 self with current self\\" story telling method, it increasingly feels as his entire persona is forced and it trying very hard to seem like he doesn't care at all, if you know what I mean.  At one point in the film, he admits to copying his \\"style\\" from a 2-piece band he saw in North Carolina (name of band I cannot recall).  Also, there was actually very little guitar playing.  When there was any, it wasn't very inspiring.  There was maybe 15mins of good material in this entire movie.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|You must see this movie in 3D!  It has elicited such feeling and emotion that i cannot seem to put it aside.  I just saw it this morning...thats true...but i don't think i will change my mind tomorrow.  I will pay whatever the charge for this movie on DVD when it comes out, and i do mean ANY price.  I will also see it again...and again.  See it and see it often.  It is more beautiful than mere words can express.  WOW!
6305428522|4.0|Is there honesty in any show that has prizes involved?  I don't think so.  People are out there trying to hustle people out of pocket change, so why wouldn't contestants try dishonesty when big prizes, big money and/or instant fame is there for the taking.<br /><br />The Actors in \\"Quiz Show\\" play their characters realistically and creatively.  The script was brilliant and perfectly delivered by everyone in front of the cameras.  Support crews were perfect.  Every detail seemed to be connected and complete.  A thoroughly professional group effort.<br /><br />The story is probably known by most of the viewers, but just in case you're not, in a nutshell... winning contestants are given the answers to the questions on this popular game show.  Eventually, this illegal practice is discovered, investigated and finally, was the basis for the restructuring of television games shows.<br /><br />I think that Ralph Fiennes did a marvelous job with his role of braniac to T.V. celebrity.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|Having missed the movie when it was at our local theater, I just hoped the film would be worth the lower than movie ticket, popcorn and a drink price of $9 that Amazon offered.  To my pleasant surprise, It was one of the best STAR TREK movies I have seen.  In fact, it was good enough to have an additional screening with my \\"TREKKIE\\" sons.  They liked it even mor than I did.  High points included giving Captain Kirk a less than perfect and more believable personality.  The original Cpt. Kirk was just too perfect in ever situation.  Low points included garbled foreign accents of some cast members.  By the tim this film takes place, it would be expected for members of an academy class to all speak the same language well.    A real tragedy was running a beautiful classic Corvette over a cliff.  (I'll fast forward over that part in future viewings.)
0446615625|4.0|Usually in Baldacci's books the parts or subplots fit together rather neatly in a carefully constructed overall plot. The Camel Club follows this pattern, and the characteristic is both a strength and a weakness. The storyline marches along at a fast, plausible interconnected pace but after a certain point the overall pattern becomes visible as one begins to see how all the parts fit together. The members of the Camel Club, the \\"misfits\\" who stand apart from the society and also the treacherous activities of politics in Washington, DC, seemingly would be unable to make a difference but here they do, pursuing truth and justice as they get caught up in a crime and international intrigue. There are two main heroes in this book who stand on opposite sides of the fence: Oliver Stone, the man who tends a small church cemetery, and Alex Ford, a secret service agent, who gets the scent of foul play in a crime. To the detriment of his career he strives to ferret out the truth. The book brings in many interesting details of the sights of DC and of various federal agencies. The plot moves along quickly for the most part and there is romance to spice up the story.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)]]
B0026P3G12|3.0|This CD, like most others, you will not like every song.  I was sorely disappointed in the background music; felt Ms. Boyle was new & the producer was lacking in the instrumental accompaniment.
0385504225|2.0|The first 3/4 of the book give you exactly what you want from Dan Brown: a lot of fun.    The last quarter of the book gives you: NOTHING.    If you're like me and find yourself so put off by the astonishing predictability that recurs throughout the book (culminating in an insulting obvious climax), that the last quarter of the book is absolutely painful to read. Put it down. The last part of the book reveals absolutely nothing. It rambles and reiterates on and on in meaningless drone.     The last part of The Lost Symbol completely ruins the whole experience.
0393317552|1.0|All the hype led me to believe that this would be an insightful and intelligent analysis of world history.  It was interesting, but it so very barely skimmed the surface of the topic that it easily could have been condensed into a ten page essay.  The ideas are obvious, the treatment of the subject is shallow, and his writing is addressed to a second-grade level of world understanding.  You can get everything you need from the book by reading the description and looking up some of the referenced material.  Jared Diamond should not be respected as a scholar.

1580495990|4.0|Made it to page 49 or so - can't remember offhand - then there were two errors on a page - one dropped word and one switch \\"intimacy\\" to \\"infancy\\" - as if the book had been dictated or something?  Anyway, this was to replace an old crumbling version of the book so I contacted the publisher (haven't heard back) and won't read anymore-  too disappointing.  I love books and cherish this one - so maybe it won't bug you as much.  But to me it is absolutely unacceptable to copy a book incorrectly.  Who knows how many other errors there are.  Since the publisher hasn't responded I'm writing this review here to warn others to pick another version.<br /><br />EDIT - January 6, 2010 - The publisher just got back to me and they were phenomenal - they took the time to show me the proofs used from the original version, etc and they will be revising this in June, coming out with a corrected edition.  They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher.

B002O5M4SA|4.0|Being a Luc Besson fan, I was determined to check out the blu-ray treatment of the movie I consider his best work.  The movie is still looking great.  Reno and Portman had great performances.  The only complaint I have is the video quality as some scenes looked quite dated considering that it is not a very old movie.  Wizard of Oz, North by Northwest, Adventures of Robin Hood and Gone w/ the Wind (along with the James Bond movies) went through a process to upgrade video and audio and some of these older movies certain looked better than Leon.  I hope that the original film used to shoot this can still be retrieved and somehow be subjected to treatment.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|We've always thought this was a fantastic western since we first saw it on TV a long time ago.  On wide-screen DVD it's even better.  I think Robert Duvall once said it was his favorite role, and when you watch it you have to say it was his best role.  With one or two exceptions (like Blue Duck and Claire) the casting is excellent.  Amazon ordering and delivery was first class as usual.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|With the advent of the Awards season, I rented this simple, insightful and pleasant film to find out what made it different. Certainly, the subject has been explored ad nauseum by studios looking to cash in with the idiot crowd. Surprise! Director Marc Webb and writers Michael Webber and Mike Newstator have created a piece that could happen now or at any time. The situations to which Tom was subjected are timeless. I was him, back in the 60's. That's what makes it special. Two individuals with separate agendas get together and like each other a lot, but the important thing is that they are \\"individuals\\". The erratic time element is quite fine, giving coherence to that frightening enigma that some call \\"LOVE\\". Zooey Deschanel as the free spirited Summer handles her role like the pro that she is, a very underrated actress. Most special is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, a regular guy, Mr. Cool wannabe, and, quite simply, a guy looking for validation. Mr. Gordon-Levitt has shown remarkable work in the past (I really liked him in  \\"Mysterious Skin\\"), a fine transition from TV brat (3rd Rock) to legitimate player to be reckoned with. My admiration of his career continues to grow. Though episodic, \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" held my interest to find out what how Tom would deal with the next/past endeavor to find true love. Ya know what? Sometimes it doesn't happen, except when you're not looking... I like this film lot, and recommend it highly. UPDATE: I'm disppointed that the Academy totally ignored this little gem.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Chances are you already knew you (or insert intended gift recipient's name) liked Bob Marley & the Wailers.  This set is worth the price just to hear the 24 songs on CD #1 - some songs are older versions of popular hits that you will recognize, while others are solid cuts that you will learn to recognize quickly!  Tack on three more discs worth of material produced during their heyday, and you have an amazing volume of work, well worth every penny.
006135323X|4.0|I really liked reading this book. It is easy to read and interesting.  In the book Dan Ariely goes through a whole lot of examples of how people don't act rationally. For each chapter he has done a whole lot of experiments to make sure what he is saying is actually true. He writes about how salesmen can trick us into buying what they want us to buy, how we act so differently to normal when we are emotional, how we create self fulfilling prophecies through our expectations in all sorts of situations, how we are anchored to the first price offered to us when we are shopping around to buy something. It's all really interesting stuff about how our minds work and the experiments are really entertaining. The great thing is that while the book is actually about behavioural economics it hasn't got any complicated language, it flows really well and long boring arguments about economics are kept to a minimum. I like to read books by authors who seem to be good blokes and Ariely seems to be a good guy and in the book he talks about some of his experiences of being severely burnt when he was young.    The book has an overall thesis that the economics used by governments, regulators, universities and in commerce is all based upon the incorrect premise that people act rationally and therefore it is no good. I really don't think you need a whole book to prove that this basic assumption of most economic theories is incorrect. Any economist will tell you that. The thing is that despite that assumption being false economic theory still works to provide predictable outcomes from changes in economic parameters. So really if he is saying that the whole of economic theory needs to be re-done then the whole book argues the wrong thing. He should be proving to us that economic theory gives us the wrong outcomes and isn't useful rather than proving what everyone already knows - that people act irrationally. There is also a boring bit at the end about the global financial crisis which didn'tflow well with the rest of the book. So overall it's an entertaining read but proves a point that is trivial at best.
B00169N0BK|2.0|I'm very familiar with with challenges and criticisms surrounding the glossy iMac as a serious photography platform.  Unfortunately, my iMac purchase predated my revived photography interest.  Be that as it may, after spending a year transitioning into a semi-serious/advanced amateur digital photogrpahy mode, I realized I needed to get my system calibrated somehow.  After doing significant web research, I settled on the Colormunki.  Believe me, I really, really wanted to like it.<br /><br />Granted, some of the problems are, I believe, due to the iMac platform and hardware, not a failing of this product.  But here are my issues, for whatever they're worth.<br /><br />FIY, I am using Shades to do the luminance adjustment.  The initial levels measure out at about 300cd at the iMac factory settings.  Colormunki has me turning that down to 80cd based on ambient light conditions, which according to Shades is a level of 54%.<br /><br />1.  I typically do my daily work under an account other than the Mac OS default admin account.  Running the Colormunki calibration routine under a non-admin account fails.  The profile gets created but cannot be applied to the current user settings.  The error message is non-descriptive.  Just says the profile can not be applied.  No help in figuring out why.  So then you have to switch over to the Admin account, and run the calibration routine.  Maybe I still don't understand my iMac, but after running the calibration routine as Admin, I was unable to go back to my working account and make that the working profile.  The non-Admin account seems to be locked on to whatever profile the Admin account is using.  So, switch back to the Admin account, make that the Admin profile, then switch back to the daily use account.  But if you do the account switch via Fast User switching, every switch seems to cause the profile to get reapplied multiple times to the existing monitor setup.  So the luminance gets progressivly darker and colors go out of whack until it is totally unusable and a restart is needed.  Only successful switching process that works is to logout of the daily use account completely, log into the Admin account, create and apply the profile, then logout and back in to the daily use account.  However, I then found that the profile settings created under the Admin account weren't correct when run under the daily account.  Final steps that worked were to create the profile under the daily user account, let Colormunki save it in my user Library Colorsync folder, copy the created .icc file to the system Library Colorsync folder, logout of the daily account and into the Admin account, make the new .icc files the current profile, then log out and back in again.  This whole process took over 6 hours to figure out.<br /><br />2.  The physical configuration with the pouch and strap is terrible.  You feel like your wrestling an octopus most of the time.  If you are setting luminance based on ambient conditions, you have to take the sensor out of the pouch and sit it on the desk next to your monitor.  I know it seems like a silly thing but getting the sensor back in the pouch, with the cable and hanging strap flapping around, and some bit of confusion about the proper orientation of the sensor in the pouch (can only fit one way) makes for a very aggravating experience.<br /><br />When the sensor is in the pouch and ready to be suspended from the monitor, the USB cable attachement at the sensor and the strap attachment for the pouch are virtually right on top of one another.  This results in the USB cable and hanging strap getting twisted around each other in such a way that the sensor won't lay flat against the monitor.  You can untangle them but the cable and strap still tend to exert pulling forces on each other and can tend to keep the sensor from maintaining full and flat contact against the monitor glass.<br /><br />Maybe I didn't read deep enough into the very sparse \\"Quick Start Guide\\", but the pouchhas a little sliding plastic tab that covers the sensor eye, I presume for protection when the sensor is not in use.  If you don't see that and slide it open before you begin your calibration process, you obviously will fail.  Oddly, the Colormunki software will happily chug along doing its thing to try and calibrate the monitor until the last step when it tells you it fails but not why.<br /><br />When the sensor is in the pouch, you can't see the markings on the side of it to turn the function dial.  The sensor looks virtually identical from either side in terms of dimensions and shape, with a function dial on both sides, and so you you may be looking at the onscreen prompt to turn the dial with the accompanying picture, but you may well have the sensor backward and upside down in your hand.  But because you can't see the markings on the dial, it is not readily apparent which way you have to turn it.<br /><br />The ergonomics of this thing are probably about the worst of any device I've ever seen.<br /><br />3.  I can't trust the color corrections, whatever they are.  The iMac display doesn't display any color shift at all between the factory and Colormunki profiles.  I've even had my wife look at it and she has superb color accuity, where mine is a bit iffy.  When I look at the profile properties under Colorsync, I see that they are clearly different, but I see no difference whatsoever on the screen.  I don't know if that means the iMac factory profile is spot on for color, or if the profile changes just aren't being applied to the display.  On the otherhand, I have a second monitor attached, a Samsung Synchmaster, and when I profile it, it takes on this gastly magenta hue.  Even with my slightly substandard color vision, I can see that this isn't right.  Multiple passes with the Colormunki on the second monitor yield the same results.  So I returned the second monitor to the factory default.  Thus, as far as I can tell, the only thing my $344 bought me was a recommendation to turn the brightness on the monitor down by about half.<br /><br />Sadly, I've arrived at the conclusion that the Colormunki is not what I need.  Whether it's the iMac platform or shortcomings in this product, either way, $344 is too much to pay for this level of frustration and lack of confidence.the sensor eye, I presume for protection when the sensor is not in use.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|I had seen Roger Ebert review this film and he gave it high marks, so I decided to keep an eye out for it's DVD release. I am always interested in seeing what creative people can do with a small budget and good ideas. Movies like \\"El Mariachi\\" and \\"Primer\\" were inspirational in their ambition and execution, so I hoped to be inspired, if not entertained. Sadly, this movie failed on both counts. There are a couple moments of chills, but they are poorly set up and quickly forgotten. The camera is set up to film the bedroom while the characters sleep, but the tape fast forwards to the point where there is a bump in the night, at which point the characters may or may not awaken to investigate, then it's the next day and they seem largely unaffected by the supernatural events. The tension isn't allowed to build, and is over much too quickly. Since there is no real sense of peril to the actors until near the end, the movie fails to create fear or empathy with the audience. Hitchcock filmed \\"Rope\\" and \\"Rear Window\\" in what was essentially one room with a view and succeeded in creating tension, providing a backstory, and memorable characters. This movie failed to sustain any energy as events are just plopped in your lap, then it's morning and time for some inane conversation before the next \\"chilling moment\\". The backstory could be jotted down on a cocktail napkin with room left over for a few phone numbers, and the characters are disposable. After reading all of the one star reviews, I opted to rent rather than buy, so thankfully, if I return the movie in the morning, it will only have cost me $1.99 to discover that I'm not thrilled by slamming doors and footsteps. The guy at the video store said that his daughter slept with her lights on after watching PA. Since I'm neither a drama queen or 4 year old girl I will sleep like a baby sans illumination. A guy walked up and said he had just returned his copy and it was a really good movie and it's also a true story, so I guess if I could have convinced myself that it was a documentary, it really would've been freaky. I'm sure that some people truly were shaken up by this movie, heck, I know people who lock their car doors at intersections, and to you I say \\"Congratulations, I'm glad you enjoyed it more than I did, and there are hundreds of movies out there that are going to scare the bejesus out of you.\\" I just wish I could find a few that could make a lasting impression without resorting to a comical amount of blood and bad dialog. This review is geared more towards someone with a higher threshold for horror. I also rented \\"Mirrors\\" and it honestly was more exciting before the opening credits than PA in it's entireity, not that it was great, but it had atmosphere and nice visuals. Watching the two movies back to back was like comparing the stick figure flip book that I drew in the margins of my calculus book to \\"Citizen Kane\\". I realize that PA didn't have much of a budget and it's not a fair comparison, I'm just saying that before you plunk down your hard earned cash, there are much better choices. Rather than waste 90 minutes watching this movie, you should have a friend hold a flashlight under their chin and tell you a ghost story, then use the time you saved to watch \\"Stir of Echoes\\" instead.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I had heard some co-workers talking about it and decided to try it. I searched Amazon.com and even the price was better than in the stores in the mall. So if you're looking for an action packed movie with human interest and a love story combined \\"Australia\\" is it. I purchased it on 11/23/09 have enjoyed it over and over again (At least 4 times). Not to mention it is a tear jerker. I passed it on to my brother and he loves it too. So grab it I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|loved this movie at the theatre!  got it at a great price!  we have watched it a ga'zillion times! awesome
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I can honestly say that i've watched the entire series at least 6 or more times.. I buy alot of series, but this has to be the best one i've ever bought.. I've completely worn out the disks, since i've bought the series individually.. So now i'm buying the entire series pack.. There are so many causes and issues brought up in this show and go further than what you would see on any other show or the news and I think that is part of what makes it wonderful.. You'll fall in love with the characters and wish that someone out there would make another show just as strong and deep as this one..
B002EEP3NO|5.0|12 year old,Son saved up his money & bought this for himself.  He took his time & took him a little over a month to finish it.  Very sad when finished it.  He could have built it in a week if he didn't want to enjoy every step.  He spent all his money & happy with his purchase, but wanted the fun to last as long as it took him to save....but, overall recommend it.  Has many other star wars lego kits & now has built the ultimate.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a lovely album to listen leading up to Christmas.  Traditional as well as new songs, sung in Sarah MacLaughlin's original and unique style
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I had first watched this flick on pay per view and disagreed with the critics complaints (most likely that it wasn't a woody allen venture) . I found it entertaining and well produced. When I noticed the price on Amazon.com I just couldn't pass it up. The wide screen and quality of my purchase augmented the rapid shipping.
B001FB55H6|5.0|It's almost impossible to throw too much praise on The Watchmen. It is one of the 100 best films ever made and the greatest page to screen adaptation done in this century. It's a film for people who enjoy the art of making a great motion picture, it is a pleasure to behold, seeing it is a plain and simple awesome experience. It is also one of those rare examples of a movie actually being better than its original source material, which in itself was a brilliant act of innovation. All that said, The Watchmen also has some nice blue penis shots, and it's hard to go wrong with blue penis scenes. Seriously, though, if there is anything better than seeing The Watchmen for the first time in the big screen, it's seeing it for the first time on Blu-ray. Absolutely and unreservedly recommended to all. A bargain at many times the asking price. If you want to go to Heaven when you die, you'd better buy The Watchmen now, because the end of the world is coming and I hear it's God's favorite flick!
0316017922|1.0|This book lacked any real substance. Gladwell's points were unoriginal and based on just a few carefully selected \\"studies\\". He did not explore alternative explanations, and referenced mere opinions of random writers in order to support his claims. He spent several pages trying to make the same point over and over again in different ways, and it got very tiresome. If you have any scientific training, this book will teach you nothing new but will definitely insult your intelligence!
B002RSDW80|4.0|When Meryl Streep is on view, this movie is a delight.  With Stanley Tucci playing her husband, we get a view of Julia Child that tv could never capture.  Teh rest of the film, and I love Amy Adams, is somewhat less entertaining.  But buy it just for Meryl Streep's performance, and you won't be disappointed.
0740748475|5.0|Oh man I've been waiting to buy thees volumes forever , but I didn't have the money . When Christmas came I wasn't expecting anything special , but soon enough I open this big , awesome present , and the three Calvin and Hobbes books are in there !!!<br /><br />Any way thees books are fantastic ! Arguably the best comics in the businesses are now neatly sealed in this very professional book case . The only problem is the price (150 $, list price ) , around 90 $ from amazon . But its worth EVERY PENNY!!!<br />Thees volumes are like a treasure to me , and for millions of other people . This is a must get if you are looking for some old time , funny , loving , and just down right awesome comic strips !<br /><br />Thanks for looking at my review .
B0006GAOBI|5.0|First of all, in this review I am mostly going to address the idea of the constant debate over the Theatrical Version vs. the Director's cut. This is not really a summary, so yeah, sorry.    I don't know if I can say which is better, it's really up to personal preference. The director's cut is different in the sense that it adds in some scenes, slightly alters others, and changes/rearranges some of the music and scoring.     The theatrical cut is much more poetic. A lot of people say that it is better because it leaves so much interpretation as to what all happens to the viewer.     The Director's Cut helps explain more of what happens, and the supernatural aspect of it, and leaves less interpretation. It tends to put a lot of focus on the sci/fi side of it.     Most people tend to like the version better that they saw first. I would recommend the Theatrical Version, but really either is better. For any Donnie Darko fan, I'd say to have both. I really like the commentary on the Director's Cut, it helps get an insight into all the thoughts that went into the movies, the changes made in the director's cut, and the music. It is quite interesting to listen to.    Hope that might help your decision.   =)
B002R68U7K|5.0|This was a birthday gift for our daughter.  She is a huge Britney Spears fan and loved the collection.  She is also loved the gift box that the singles came in.
0785814531|5.0|one of the better collections of Poe's work. Havent had a problem with the binding that tends to happen with the bigger books. I suggest getting this over the other copies available. Great addition to any book shelf and its also a great source of \\"alternative\\" literature for my 8yo neice who is tired of reading about \\"hank the cowdog.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|I liked Susan Boyle's singing when I first heard her on You Tube.  However, this CD showcases her talent in many areas such as pop, gospel, and carols.  I play this CD over and over!
B002RVZV9U|3.0|I was expecting a lot more out of this.   Very little footage of the three of them together.  This is basically three mini -life bios with a little footage of them together spread throughout.  There were some cool pieces but not $18 worth.  Also, if you are a fan of these three guitarists chances are you have already seen at least a few of the performances from other sources.  This disc reminds me of the history channel where they take a few experts, talk about the subject and intersperse some old clips or art.  I recommend Led's 2003 DVD and White's Black Pool Lights.    Rent this one first.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Got these wireless controllers for Christmas and expected them to work flawlessly as did my wireless PS2 controller.  Buttons become unresponsive during gameplay (on Fallout 3, it was the L2 key and I was stuck in \\"hidden\\" mode; in Oblivion stuck on R3). In googling, the solution I found was to pull the button in the opposite direction. This has worked but is a nuisance in the game & I suspect isn't good for the controller. Also, the charge doesn't hold as long as I expect and this is a bit fussy to deal with, even having a backup controller. PS My PS2 wireless controller--that continues to work great--is a Logitec. Aside from those issues...it has become inconceivable to play a video game with a corded controller- much tidier.
1582701709|5.0|I'm not a critic about the book, I'll just say I was happy with the seller.  The book was nearly free which means I could care less if its a good read or not. I paid for shipping.  Its basically, think happy thoughts, and happy things will happen.

0385341008|5.0|It's rare to find a book that's uplifting without being sugary or preachy.  This book is filled with real people whose lives you long to be a part of.  They have known trials and sadness but have emerged stronger and supportive of each other.<br />I have a tenuous connection to Guernsey - having purchased two sweaters from the Guernsey Knitwear Company - each one well crafted for a lifetime.  The first purchase was when I was a young girl in France, the second when I happily stumbled onto their web site in my 50s.  I wrote a note with my second order and the president of the company wrote me back.  With my sweater came a brochure about Guernsey, a newsy letter, and a personal invitation to look the president up if I ever came that way.  Every thing I know about these people and their island bespeaks a warm, friendly, caring attitude that is rare today.  With this book, the two memories are happily tied together and I am reminded that the world can be better than it seems most days.  Enjoy the read and believe in the goodness of people again!
B002OOG6RQ|1.0|If you've at all heard the controversy surrounding this CD, (they made a porn video for a song, I don't remember which one, they're all terrible), don't get suckered in by it, every song is just BORING.  If you're going to do controversal things to hype a CD, at least make the music good.  The song P****, for example, is just offensively stupid. (I can't print the lyrics in it that are in English 'cause I'd probably get kicked off Amazon for it.)  I'm not offended by anything about the CD, but, COME ON Rammstein,  this sucks!  Every review I've come across, magazine, online, whatever; keeps saying that this is just amazing stuff, their best stuff ever.  Really? Did we get the same CD?  'Cause I don't see it.  And don't think I didn't give it a chance, I listened to it SEVERAL times trying to like it, but couldn't.
0307266303|5.0|This book was excellent.  It entertained, it taught and it gives an out of the box look at running.  It's incredibly funny in parts, and thoughtful in others.  The \\"Ultra Marathoners\\" sound more like a group of Deadheads touring the country rather than a group of elite athletes.     I am not a hard core runner, but this book sits up with my favorites: Running Scarred, Why We Run, and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, good stuff.
1932100660|5.0|This book is wonderful! No wonder people are huge and are dying from diseases left and right in America...time to seek out the truth instead of rely on the FDA and the USDA to tell us what to eat!
0470477237|5.0|Erik Qualman is clearly at the forefront of Social Media thinking and how best to harness it for businesses and consumers! This isn't just a detailing of how we should be involved in social media it's also an illustration of why we should be in Social Media as consumers and as businesses, clearly illustrating cause and effect. The most salient point clearly resonates with me: the social media revolution is happening with or without me; without sounding trite or cliched, Qualman details, with irrefutable and compelling case studies, that this (social media) is the way things are going to be, radically changing how it always was! The combination of intellectual, understandable and relaxed is a difficult chord to strike but Qualman does it with ease. Read this book.
B000A59PMO|4.0|This TV series was given as a gift, but I enjoyed the series very much during it's run. This was the early introduction of Kristen Bell to a weekly audience, and I still consider this show to be her best work.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This is a phenomenal movie. Let me say that the undocumentary style footage of some of the action scenes made me feel as if I were really watching these events unfold. The conventional theme of seamless transition between documentary style and Hollywood style filming was brilliant.
B001NLL93W|5.0|i thought that this book would not nearly be as good as the other two that i had preivously read, but i was very very wrong. This is one of the most suspenseful, romantic and addictimg books that i have ever read. the ending was the exact one that i had hoped for and more. I LOVE JACE!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|When someone hacks into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division; the Director decides to round up all the hackers who could have done this. When he's told that because it's the 4th of July most of their agents are not around so they might have trouble getting people to get the hackers. So he instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane manages to get them out but they're still being pursued. And it's just when McClane arrives in Washington that the whole system breaks down and chaos ensues. Willis is in his element. Olyphant is perfectly ice cold. Some great action sequences, including a fight to the death in an elevator shaft. This movie takes a classic climactic situation and resolves it in the coolest, most unexpected and most low-tech way imaginable, and in a way that reinforces everything you've ever liked about the \\"Die Hard\\" movies and McClane as a character. It's just terrific.
1416594787|5.0|This book reads almost like a text book. It is filled with fascinating facts that you don't want to forget, as if a test is looming. I would have really enjoyed a class taught by Richard Dawkins. He is quite brilliant and I can only wish for such great reasoning power as he possesses. This book should have been required text in classrooms from the 1950's and forward. What a shame there is such ignorance in the world at this late date. American education has a long way to catch up. Books like this help immensely by explaining in lay terms what life means.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|This movie is alive with infectious rhythm, likable characters, and slick dance moves. Anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't no what dancing is becuase this movie couldn't have been better. Watch this movie I guarantee you'll like it.
B002QEXN2K|2.0|This is going to be a very short review, as I am so disappointed.  I am a great fan of John Mayer - but I just don't know what happened here!  Did he do it in his sleep?  It is horribly bland.  I kept hoping \\"the next track will be better,\\" but it wasn't.  His guitar work was very careful and the songs - no inspiration there either.  Even the cover photo is dreadfully pretentious.  I am just hoping this is a temporary glitch.  Try a bit harder next time, John.  There's nothing battling about this album, it sounds as if you have given up the fight.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Step Up 2 The streets was such an amazing movie. The dancing is very cool. The characters were picked wonderfully.  This is a very good movie and highly recomend it.
B002R0F3Q2|1.0|They get a hold of what started out as a talented artist and then make them into a money making machine. This cd was a disappointment, it is so commercial.It started with the last album, but this one is worse. It doesn't sound like Alicia...I guess I will have to listen to \\"Alicia Keys Diary and Unplugged CD till it wears out, so I can get my Alicia keys fix. She was my favorite artist cause she had her own sound and style. Now she just blends in with the rest.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Margaret Tate,a Canadian immigrant who creates a demanding and difficult work environment for her subordinates at the office. When the news arrives that she's about to be deported to the Great White North, she rushes into a marriage of convenience with her young assistant Andrew Paxton (played by Ryan Reynolds)to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are well matched in slight romantic comedy. It was refreshing that this movie delivered even more fun than expected. This movie is very well written and directed. It also had much more than just laughs. A must see.
0385523904|4.0|Barbara Demick writes an amazing book on the lives of 6 different defectors, she brings insight into the lives of people that we know so little of their day to day life.  I found it striking that many people in this book knew of times that were better, and slowly their resources and freedoms were taken away.  None of these changes happened over night, but in any other country teachers don't watch their students starve to death, doctors must go out and search for their own herbs to heal their patients, and people constantly watch what they say in front of their neighbors.<br /><br />Lives are intertwined in this book beautifully.  We see what it is like to be a single adult and making it to college despite a caste system that would ordinarily pull us down. We see how even a doctor steals food from the collective to survive.  We see a family struggle with the a careless comment made to a neighbor, when it carries so much weight.  Having known many Russians from the communist era, I have heard their stories about shortages, and getting goods on the black market, their stories pale in comparision to the struggles the people have in North Korea.<br /><br />The entire country is indoctrinated from birth to live for the country, do to for our country, and to sacrifice for our country.  These people are asked to do this in a way we would consider unimaginable.  We hear of when times were better, and how factories fell into shambles, of when they had electricity, and times when they have electricity for only a few hours at a time, and a time when there was plenty to eat, and then through a famine where 1/5 of their population died. Once you set this book down, you will always remember the struggles of those who were lucky enough to leave their homeland.
B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is a breath of fresh air in a shot em up world. I laughed, I cried. I thought this movie was one of the best I have seen in awhile. It is a awesome, inspiring, really great movie, and definately worth seeing.

B00275EGX8|5.0|Being a couch commando since any battle action I've seen are from movies or playing video games I really cannot tell you for sure if the scenes in this movie are accurate or not, but I do know good acting and good movies if I see one. I am sure this movie wasn't made to portray real war scenarios or simulate the feeling of being in one, but it was good entertainment from my experience of it. The actors had a very good time making the movie, and it does show how stressful it would be if you were to encounter a position that your life would be lost if the wrong choices would be made. If you are like me and have spent some time playing First Person Shooters, and are into action movies. This is a good movie for you, if you are a purest and want to see if this portrays real life scenarios, this movie isn't for you. If I were you I would go to [...] and do some research and read the reviews from respectable reviewers before making a purchase in case there is any doubt that you might find the movie enjoyable :)
B000EGEVZK|5.0|No, wait a minute...bloody fantastic is what this is.  I was not a big Ramones fan back in the day, probably only because my local radio stations did not expose me to their work, other than Beat on the Brat, and I Wanna Be Sedated.  And silly me, I didn't want to believe a band from NYC could be any good.  Yes, I was stupid, I learned there are many great NY bands.  What made me buy this DVD was seeing their 1985 performance on the Old Grey Whistle Test Volume One DVD (a series I highly recommend).<br /><br />Captured here is a virtual biography of Ramones performances from the beginning (1974) through the end (1996), and honestly, I didn't even know they were still performing after about 1985.  Again, stupid me, but thankfully this catalog of performances is well preserved.  While the films of earliest performances are a bit scratchy and fuzzy, so was the musicianship of the band.  One can see and feel that something unique is developing, and as the band grows up, the musicianship and songwriting becomes better and more complex (and the film/video improves as well).<br /><br />Most of this collection is very well preserved considering the age of the media it was captured on. For example, the footage from the 1982 San Bernardino US Festival is crystal clear, bright, colorful, and the audio thunderous.  Conversely, on \\"The Cars Unlocked\\" DVD, footage from the same festival - of The Cars - is grainy, washed-out, and the sound tinny.  Obviously great care was taken by The Ramones and those close to them to preserve these memories.<br /><br />My old impression of the band was that it was a novelty act with a few clever hits.  Watching this, I see the care that was taken in their uniform (jeans and leather jackets), the presentation - the simultaneous movements of Johnny and Dee Dee, the uncluttered stage, and respect for the audience - never facing away, 100 percent music and no idle banter.<br /><br />A great companion piece to these performances is the biography \\"End of the Century\\" DVD. Learning about how the band members met, developed, and put up with each other over the many years is somehow compelling, and heightened my enjoyment of the performances on this DVD.  Really, it's a crime that the Ramones were pretty much ignored by US radio stations.  Do yourself some justice and buy this.about how the band members met, developed, and put up with each other over the many years is somehow compelling, and heightened my enjoyment of the performances on this DVD.

0385532458|3.0|At first I was quite disappointed with Ford County. But I have read every other John Grisham novel so I am morally obligated to read everything (with the exception of \\"An Innocent Man\\") this man writes.<br /> I told someone as I was reading \\"Ford County\\" (and taking forever to do so) that \\"I am disappointed with \\"Ford County\\". If I wanted to read short stories about ne'er do wells and people who make bad choices, I can simply pick up the Cincinnati Enquirer.\\"<br />\\"Funny Boy\\", the last story in the book made the whole book worth the read. I wish it were a full novel. I enjoyed two others as well: \\"Quiet Haven\\" and \\"Fish Files\\".

0316010669|3.0|It took me 2 weeks to finish the book.    At the first few page, my \\"Blink\\" was telling me that I got the right book, the book that helps to stimulate and initiate further awareness on self-consciousness, to help us in controlling our \\"Blink\\".     However, upon finishing the book, I was very disappointed at how much fact and experiment the book had given, but no absolute \\"help\\" was given. Of course, it's impossible to write a complete guide to control \\"Blink\\", but I was expecting a more \\"solution\\" to help us understand the word \\"Blink\\", and using it across the world instead of focusing only on \\"Black\\" and \\"Guns\\".    More examples and case studies I'd like to hear are the \\"poor\\" and \\"crimes\\", how do you \\"Blink\\" on someone who dresses smart but is incapable to do anything, how do you \\"Blink\\" on a potential employee who looks promising, and whether all those \\"Blink\\" are \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" ?

0896898288|3.0|I received this book as a gift. I loved the stories, the pictures of the blocks and finished quilts.  I will probably make this in the future;HOWEVER, I have had trouble running the CD, the first time I tried it worked but I did not have time to print each individual template ( could not several be on one page?). When I went to use it tonight, the disc snapped in half inside the  disc hold while running. Any way to get a replacement?  For future reference, I feel it would have been helpful to have measurements for each pattern piece that could be rotary cut, thus eliminating printing so many templates.  Thanks

B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini-series will capture you the moment you start watching and won't let go until you're finished, then it will stay with you forever.  You will go away with a whole new understanding, respect and feelings of awe at what the men of WWII, and specifically, this group - the men of Easy Company - were able to accomplish, many times in situations that would cause the majority of us to be incapable of functioning.  Yet somehow, they managed to go on to save the world.  One of my wishes would be to meet the men this story is about and be able to thank them in person.  If you value our country's history at all, this movie will be one that you will cherish.    You will get to \\"know\\" the characters and grow to feel as if you've known them for years.  You will go through their basic training, their first jump, the frustrations, the physical exhaustion, the hardships, and sense the brotherhood that you know is a life-long bond.  You'll be with them as they enter into war.  You'll experience the tension on the plane as they waited to jump into enemy territory on D-Day, and it will leave you glued to your tv.   You'll feel that stinging cold as they sit in wait at Bastogne, while being pummeled by the Germans.  Then at the end, you'll share that exhilaration of \\"we made it\\" with them.  By the ending credits, if you don't want to stand up and salute these men and run out and buy the biggest flag you can get, then it's time to re-evaluate your patriotism and sense of appreciation for our WWII vets.    The acting is superb -- the different actors chosen for their roles were perfect.  I hadn't ever seen Damian Lewis in anything before this, and now he is one of my favorite actors.  He is phenomenal in the role of Dick Winters.  Ron Livingston was also great in his role, as well as all the other actors.  I was quite surprised at how well David Schwimmer was able to pull off the gruff attitude of Capt. Sobel.  Having seen him as the goofy character he was in \\"Friends\\", this movieshowed his great acting ability.      On the cover of the DVD box, it says \\"They depended on each other and the world depended on them\\".  All I can say is thank goodness for men like this, who were willing to do what it took to defend our nation.  Find a vet and thank him / her today.  We have a lot to thank them for.

0767817478|1.0|He flat-out admitted he didn't like the original Japanese Godzilla, so why did he even bother making this?  Why didn't Hollywood give the project to someone who was actually a fan of the series?  Why did Toho give the OK to Emmerich in the first place?  Oh yeah...money.     This movie could have been passable on a superficial level if it was maybe 30 minutes shorter and didn't turn into a Jurassic Park rip-off half-way through.  The effects are good and the action sequences are exciting enough, but it takes a while to get going, and most of the human characters are incredibly obnoxious.  Do yourself a favor and stick with the decent Japanese Godzilla films like Gojira, Mothra vs. Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Biollante, or Godzilla vs. Destroyer (the latter two have yet to see decent DVD releases in the US).
B00006JDSI|4.0|\\"Nosteratu\\" was an unauthorized adaption of Bram Stoker's novel \\"Dracula\\" made by a German film company in 1922. The company couldn't get the rights to the novel so they just changed a few things (like the charaters' names) and did it anyway. They were successfully sued by Bram Stoker's widow, and all copies of the film were ordered destroyed. Fortunately some still remained, and now can be enjoyed by everyone.<br /><br />Okay so this may be a silent film, but boy was it scary; it was very very well made. Count Orlock is very scary, and the director did a great job at setting a very eerie mood. I don't like silent films, but I was curious about this one and checked it out from my local library. The next day, I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately I bought a different version which was heavily edited, had a crappy picture, the names of the charaters were change to fit the names of the charators in Bram Stoker's novel, and the music was totally different and crappy too. It cost me $20.00 and the video store wouldn't allow me to return it. Then I bought the good version from Amazon and it only cost me $7.00. You want the good version by Kino Video which is unedited, has a great picture, has the original charaters' names, and has two great musical scores in it. That's the one you want. It's by Kino Video.<br /><br />In all, it was a great and scary movie which I highly recommend!
B001NXBRJG|5.0|I just got my first Blu-ray player, an LG BD370. The first disc I played in it was this one. The movie played fine, but it looks like the player couldn't read the menu. I was never able to access it. It seemed like the player tried to read the menu for about 30 seconds after I loaded the disc, then it went straight to playing the movie, and I never was able to get to the menus. The movie looks gorgeous. I checked but haven't found any firmware upgrades for my player. Has anyone else had trouble playing this movie on an LG player? I'm going to contact LG customer service next.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My son watches this movie over and over again, and we never get tired of it! A true classic movie, the graphics and story are a wonderful depiction of what Christmas is truly like. This is actually our second copy of the movie, as we had wore out the first!
0810983915|5.0|I have an 11 year old son who would rather do anything except read.Once he was turned on to Diary of A Wimpy Kid everything changed. He was reading them so fast I couldnt purchase them fast enough. He has now completed the 5 book series and I am eager for more to come out! This was a terrific tale of a child that kept the whole family laughing as my son read it to us or we read it for ourselves.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|It is very kinetic in pacing, the story in retrospect is rather thin, but this is a setup movie after all. I am not a fan of the original Star Trek tv series nor a sci-fi fan per se but a Star Wars fan (Episodes IV and V really). The acting is also good. One major complaint is the lighting effects that show a cross of light in the corners of nearly every frame. Honestly it gets old really quick and nearly seizure inducing. This is definitely a good movie but not something I would watch repeatedly, more like once a year.
0385341008|5.0|\\"I heard about this book long before I decided to look into myself.  The title is not one easily ignored; and the recommendations from others quickly draw a person into its pages.  The cover is opened, and the first letter is being read before you are even aware.  Yes, this is a novel comprised entirely of letters between Juliet, the residents of Guernsey, and the people whom Juliet knows as friends; which could be a bit of a distraction to some, if not for the wonderful characters these letters reveal.  They speak with their own voice, conveying a true first-person narrative, offering a more complete telling of the story of the island, and how the perils of war affect a people, than only a solitary individual might relay.\\"
B002HWRYJE|4.0|First off, I'm a Star Trek fan! The Star Trek movies have needed the shot in the arm for a while and this is a thrill ride. My only complaint is that I didn't get the deluxe edition. Enjoy.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I was very pleased with \\"Julie & Julia\\" DVD.  Meryll Streep is a wonderful actres and I am never disappointed in her movies.  I have fond memories of watching Julia Child on TV. Streep certainly captured Julia Child's mannerisms and \\"verve\\" with her cooking skills,  and sometimes making mistakes, and laughing them off. I really enjoyed this movie and am a loyal customer of Amazon.    Carroll L. Heath
B002K4MAA2|5.0|I will never understand the U.S. dvd market.  The U.K. has the best releases, whether it is Laurel and Hardy, Creepshow, The Hammer Films, Psycho, etc.  There has been so many things not released, or half assed by the studios I had to purchase a region free dvd player just to get the films and sets I wanted.  Dead Set is a great zombie mini series.  Running time is 2 1/2 hours long, though it could have really been fleshed out even more.  The short form of the story has the contestants of the Big Brother reality show locked away in their house while the world falls into chaos very quickly as the dead begin to rise.  By the time the contestants realize what is going on, it is too late.  They are trapped while the world falls down around them.  Terrific British zombie tale and hopefully since it was mentioned in EW by Stephen King, it may get enough buzz to get it released over here.  Decent zombie makeup and good gore.  Camera is very quick when the zombies attack, and the zombies are the running versions.  Great dvd.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|James Cameron's Avatar.  What more is there?  This is a movie I've anticipated for years and the pay-off is a spectacle of mostly seamless special effects partnered with slam-bang action.  It is an entertaining film well-worth the price of admission and is one not to be missed this Holiday Season.<br /><br />However, that being said...Avatar suffers from several flaws mainly concerning its plot and cheap dialogue fused with dues ex machina devices that come close to muddling down the feel of the entire film.  You can tell when actors don't improv because, I hate to say it, but Cameron's dialogue is not very believable, nor is it engaging in this film.  Veterans such as Sigourney Weaver (who ad-libbed the most famous line from Cameron's ALIENS) proves to be (for me) the most likable character in the entire film; Weaver's a veteran and she flows smoothly in her role.  In fact several performances in here are very good.  The rest of the supporting cast is also utilized effectively...That is until we get to our star, Sam Worthington (who earlier this year starred in the weak Terminator: Salvation).<br /><br />I have to compare Worthington to Keenu Reeves in the Matrix movies just because this is another case where it seems the entire supporting cast has more talent and enthusiasm for the project than the lead-actor.  This guy just doesn't seem interested in the material at all!  He just gives the vibe that he's reading directly off a teleprompter whenever he speaks.  There was very little depth to this performance and never did I identify with the emotional responses conveyed by Worthington (even WITH CGI motion-capture fix-ups).<br /><br />That brings me Worthington's character Jake Sully...I don't know whether it's Worthington or Cameron's script but I often found this character unbelievably bland.  He's obviously supposed to represent an \\"everyman\\" but even being wheelchair bound he failed to catch my interest as an individual.  Backstory is clich&eacute;, as is most aspects of this character and he just felt like a tired retread of \\"that dude who makes things happen.\\"  In fact I don't think this character had ANY flaws outside of being crippled; no emotional issues, obsessions, or anything that could complicate his character.  In short: He could probably try out for sainthood.<br /><br />Not to worry, for our supporting characters manage to win my praise.  Stephen Lang (Gettysburg) is the particularly cold Colonel Miles Quaritch proving to be a very intimidating screen presence in his apathetic tone towards the violence surrounding him.  Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine just about steals away the entire movie with her limited screen time and throughout the film I was wishing the plot concentrated more on her.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana through the magic of motion-capture and computer wizardry plays our female lead of Neytiri and I'll say this: she is far more engaging of a character than her male-lead.  She does suffer from some clich&eacute;s as the Worthington character did, but this actress gave a lot of spunk to this gal that made it very easy to forgive her shortcomings in the script.<br /><br />The rest of the Na'Vi...they're okay I guess; nothing really unique about any of them.  Chief, medicine woman, lead warrior...that's basically the only other characters there are because for a movie that tried to center on the Na'Vi we only really get to know is Neytiri.  The rest are basically  CGI rendered, moving backgrounds running around without any unique features (though, towards the end we get a 10 second look of the female chief of the coast dwelling Na'Vi who has a red triangle painted across her chest: in those seconds she already became more interesting than most of the other Na'Vi characters).<br /><br />As for the visual look: it is fantastic, as you would expect from its budget, but that being said: like the plot it also has its fair share of flaws.<br /><br />For the human compound and vehicles Cameron basicallycopies many designs previously employed in ALIENS, and as much as I loved that film's designs, I didn't want to see them being used again in this manner: it feels at times like Cameron was too lazy to come up with new designs so he spruced up his old ones and refurbished them.<br /><br />The jungle obviously had the most work put into it.  There are beautiful shots of floating mountains (still bothers me that those are NEVER explained: I can only suspend disbelief for so long without so much as an illogical explanation).  Every creature, tree, and aspect of this screams of adventure...but some of the things just seem like Cameron wanted to blow his budget in as many ways as possible.  Everything is beautiful, but some of the things in this jungle make such little sense that I doubt they were created except as an excuse to fully utilize the budget.<br /><br />Also, the Na'Vi are impressive visual achievements, but given the budget I am enormously disappointed by Cameron's lack of diversity with these characters.  Most of them look EXACTLY the same.  At one point we are show several of the tribes across the planet and all they have are different cultural garb...otherwise they are all exactly the same color, design, and look.  Was it too hard to change the skin tones between these regions?  This is the most expensive movie ever made and they aren't going to try and diversify at all?  It would have added a whole other degree of realism...maybe he could have done that instead of having lizard-insects that flew like little helicopters.<br /><br />Wrapped in Cameron's veteran direction the film at least succeeds in being constantly thrilling to the eyes.<br /><br />So I've mentioned art, direction, acting, characters...so there's only one thing left.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about this film is the plot.  It is very generic as well as predictable.  Every character you meet in this film you essentially know the moment they speak what role they're going to play in the plot.  I'll list a few types here:<br /><br />Movie's villain<br />Corporate official more concerned with profit than life<br />No nonsense doctor<br />Guy who begins hating lead than allies himself with him<br /><br />You also can predict EVENTS far before they happen.  Most of the movie is self-spoiling, and not in the Greek tragedy foreshadowing type of way.<br /><br />Hero starts out of place<br />Hero does what no one else could<br />Falls in love with other<br />Hero is accepted into group after short amount of time<br />Hero becomes the leader during this short time<br />Hero chooses to side with new group<br /><br />The list goes on, but I think you get my drift.  As for the plot it's a generic \\"outsider\\" story with a few new twists, but overall it's the same story previously found in Lawrence of Arabia and The Last Samurai...if you mixed them with...Romance...Ugh, it just did not work in this film.  Every. Single. Bit. Of romantic dialogue fell flat in this piece, as well as having Cameron's most spontaneous sex scene since The Terminator in 1984 (convenient that the aliens here have the EXACT same ways of showing affection, and mating as modern USA citizens, is it not?).<br /><br />As well-done as it is the film can't help but leave gaping plot holes every which way it goes while ramming obvious symbolism and messages down the audience's throat to the point that I wanted to write a letter to James Cameron saying \\"I don't want to be lectured about environmental issues by someone who just spent over $300+ million on a bloody movie.\\"  Is he subtle about these messages?  Nope; not at all.  Unless you have NO knowledge of European/USA forces dislocating Native Americans or the Iraq War the symbolism you may find yourself sighing at the dialogue where they essentially lecture the audience about things any adult should be well-aware of.<br /><br />I also don't like how human the Na'Vi were made out to be.  I  had a similar gripe with the very-human aspects of the Prawn in District 9, but at least in that film the aliens looked...well, alien.  Here we essentially have giant Native Americans, painted them blue, threw on tails, and tossed them out for a sci-fi reenactment of American history (but with a happy Hollywood ending).  This also means we get some horrendously clich&eacute; dialogue modeled off what must have been Indians in 1960's Westerns; it just wasn't believable in the slightest.  Never ONCE did I believe the Na'Vi to be aliens or that culturally they were different from human tribes.<br /><br />As a visual achievement the film is astounding, but I don't feel it's really left a lasting impression on me; it doesn't come close to topping the visuals of Pan's Labyrinth as the most visionary movie of the decade.  Avatar is a fun, engaging ride that leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained, but in the end isn't much more than a well-made blockbuster that doesn't transcend greatness as other films of the genre had.  Cameron just seemed at times that he did things not because the plot required it, but because he wanted to be praised as a \\"visionary.\\"  I wish he had spent more time on his script than he had on the look of this film.<br /><br />4/5 Stars<br />hwith profit than life   No nonsense doctor   Guy who begins hating lead than allies himself with him     You also can predict EVENTS far before they happen.

B000OPOAJS|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, MGM decided to pull a fast one and release a lobotomized Blu-ray version.    First of all, it uses old-school, low bitrate MPEG-2 encoding (so much for the the \\"superior\\" picture quality of Blu-Ray).    Fine, I could have lived with that... except for the fact that, as others have mentioned, the Blu-ray release contains absolutely no special features at all! None. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Not even the stuff on the DVD release! WTF!?!?    I suppose MGM will eventually come out with a \\"Special Edition\\" Blu-Ray with the missing features, expecting us to also purchase that. No Way!!!    I'm returning this for a refund. I've spent quite a bit of money buying stuff off of Amazon over the years, and this is the first time I'm returning anything. It should tell you how ticked off I am about this.    Also, Amazon really needs to segregate the reviews for the Blu-ray release from the DVD reviews. It's sometimes very difficult to wade through 100s of reviews to find out if the Blu-ray release is worth buying over the DVD release.
0307454541|5.0|This was really a good book.  It started a little slow, but really picked up and kept moving!  Loved the characters and the storyline.  Can't wait to read the sequel!!
B001TH16DI|3.0|The video in TOS is good but the audio has much to be desired. If you want a really good collection of a Star Trek Series, I would recommend TNG series as the picture and sound are perfect. This is mainly due to the technology that was available at the time of filming these two series. It's a definite must for the die hard Trekkie fans out there! I personally own all of the Star Trek Series in Blu Ray and would like to share my opinion with everyone else - Amazon has thye best5 deals on blu rays in the world!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The whole family loved this movie, child, parents and grandparents.  We will watch it again.  Three of us had seen it before in 3D and there were still parts of it that were 'new' to us.    Wonderful storyline and a reminder to all of us that there is life out there if you go out and find it.
B001EO748M|5.0|This is the most gripping dramatic historical series I've ever seen. As I finished each episode, I could barely wait for the next one, and there were occasions when I watched two or three episodes back to back, getting me to bed late and leaving me tired the next day -- but it was worth it. It's said that time flies when you're having fun, and some of these episodes felt like only 5 or 10 minutes. My wife had the same response.<br /><br />The power of this series is a result of achieving excellence in all facets. The actors are uniformly convincing, the scenery is authentic and transporting, and the pacing and dynamics of the plot have a perfect ebb and flow. Many key dimensions of the human experience are represented, such as romance, (hot) sex, power politics, attempts at justice, friendship, revenge, religious conflict, glimpses of ordinary life, and violence so brutal that we tender Americans can scarcely comprehend or stomach it.<br /><br />As to historical accuracy, I'm not qualified to judge with expertise, but I suspect that they got the general contours reasonably right, even if some details are debatable. Moreover, none of us were actually there and reconstructing the past always involves much inference, so a useful approximation is all we can aim for anyway. I would hope that anyone watching or reading a historical work will know to take things with a grain of salt, especially the details.<br /><br />Some lessons I drew from the series are: (a) I'm glad I don't live in the England of this period, (b) being King isn't all it's cracked up to be, and (c) check your ambition and stay away from highly powerful people, lest you fall out of favor and wind up damaged or worse.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in the European history of this period (particularly that of England), or to anyone who just enjoys great drama.<br /><br />Note: I've watched all three seasons and they're all equally excellent, so I've posted this review for all three.

0156034026|5.0|Hamid has written some of the most beautiful prose that I have read in a long time. His story is simple:  Changez, a Pakistani man, tells an American stranger in Lahore about his years in the USA. The book is a long monologue since the American never speaks and the entire monologue is over an evening's meal. It is very clearly written and the beauty is in its simplicity. Hamid creates suspense and urges the reader to continue reading to find out how a successful  bright young man can be radicalized in the USA. In light of the recent attempt to blow up an airline on Christmas day by another young bright 23 year old, I was particularly curious to read this book.    I found Changez' journey to fundamentalism not very convincing which was a bit disappointing. Nevertheless the author brings up so many interesting issues for the reader to think about that I think makes the book worthy of 5 stars. The author used to work at McKinsey, a management consulting firm. It is clear that he has drawn on his experiences at McKinsey to tell Changez' work stories at Underwood Samson, a valuation firm. With writing this beautiful, Hamid is on his way to perhaps winning the Booker prize someday . The writing was reminiscent of Ishiguro's \\"Remains of the Day\\". Highly recommended.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I dont think this is the greatest movie in the world as many do, but this movie is worthwhile because it shows Michael Jackson as a normal, working, professional person.  Why this was never documented while he was one of our greatest living creative treasures, I cannot fathom.     This movie shows MJ working.  Rehearsing.  Making his paces on stage.  Sometimes he dances and believe me, the man still had the magic.  His backup dancers are in the 18-20 year old range - and MJ blows them out of the water without even trying.     There is no Wacko Jacko stuff here.  Just the working, professional musician Michael Jackson.     Why people like Bashir would make a scandalous documentary about MJ when he had the opportunity to  document a genius, living artist at work, is beyond comprehension.      And for all the haters -- the news reports now say that the FBI investigated MJ for 10 years looking for evidence of child molestation and they came up with NOTHING.
031236198X|1.0|I thought \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" was a simple, but insightful book. Our Iceberg Is Melting is just not worth the 45 min it takes to read... especially for anyone that has already read his prior work such as Who Moved My Cheese.  It feels like they just wanted to crank out another book, with as little effort as possible.  I'm not sure why so many people rated this book so high... I can only conclude that they are completely new to such concepts or have never read other books on the subject.  I know a great appeal of the book is the short length and easy to read style, but do yourself a favor and just get Who Moved My Cheese, and if you already read that, invest the 45 min of your time in something else, anything else... even a nice nap.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Just like the audience, when Susan walked onto that first stage to be judged, I was sceptical when I read \\"Day Dream Beliver\\" on the list of songs. I'm a die-hard Monkeys fan and I never would've imagine her version to be absolutely awesome. I've listened to this CD over and over and STILL get chills from the magic in Susan's voice when she sings \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". It's absolute magic!  I'm happy the world's discovered her special talent and wish her all the best.   Reese
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The review done by Roger Ebert says exactly what I thought.  No need to restate it here.  The character, Colonel Landa, is fascinating.  He is cruel, diabolical, sophisticated, urbane all at the same time.  You really like the guy, but he's so evil.  Waltz does deserve an Oscar.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is THE best christmas movie - appealing for adults and children, literature junkies and non junkies.<br />The acting is really quite good - I mean, the man had to act with muppets!!<br />And the references to the dickens novel are spot on.<br />I look forward to watching this every year - moreso than any other christmas movie!
B002JODV3S|5.0|I have been a huge Steve Vai fan since the moment I saw Yankee Rose video in 7th grade... I was like \\"WHO IS DAT!!!\\" and went looking for him, bought the album, then the rest is history, tracking down Flexable on vinyl, going to shows, worshiping his amazing technique and style... but this blu ray is the best concert dvd I own. Its crystal clear, sound is superb, you can hear the slightest fuzz from his pickups that the noise gate couldnt supress, clear as a bell, and what an amazing band playing with Steve,,, he always keeps on the cutting edge - inventing new sounds never heard, tried or even dreamed up...this is a must buy, a must own for any music lover.... (who else believes Steve is banging the violinist?!! And bejeebus, they GUSH about eachother in the interview tracks...!! anywhoo...) I have seen this DVD over 4 times already and I have had it since Christmas only...

B001V7UXG2|5.0|Our family has re-watched this series several times now and everyone loves it, in fact our 11 year old is one of the biggest enthusiasts.  Laurie & Fry really bring the characters to life, and the other characters are well cast.  Truly a top notch production.  Highly recommended.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|When you buy a Blu Ray Hi Def movie you really don't expect the Director to shake the camera and create camera glare with flashlights to make it look like an old 8mm home film with an hand-held camera.  The story was enjoyable, but direction was shakey and annoying.  Message to young directors: Take a lesson from Clint Eastwood.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|When I saw the Title of this book, I laughed. NOW, I have to read it! After reading the first few pages, my thought was, oh my, this book is all letters. How boring?? So, I stopped reading it. A few days later I was shopping and ran into a friend. She said she was going on her break to finish reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society! I could not believe it. I told her I had started it but was a bit bored with the letters. She insisted I continue with it, so I did. It was a wonderful book. So witty, funny, sad and of course the hiding of the pig! I would recommend this book for any age.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The movie was excellent, especially the first 20 minutes.  The youthful producers actually looked at real dogs to understand how they acted, they looked at films of ostriches and other birds to inderstand how they moved, and they actually hired an old man so they could understand his behavior.  Impressive!
0786838655|4.0|I enjoyed The Lightning Thief, and had very high expectations given the rave reviews I had heard. I thought it was a perfectly fine book, and I liked how the author used Greek mythology to tie together his plot -- that gave it much more depth. Having said that, I found myself constantly aware of the author (even though the narrator was technically Percy) -- I felt I was tracking the devices the author used, the choices he made for plot twists, etc., and found the ending a bit predictable. I have read other books of this genre that swept me up in the story, so that during the period of reading it, it felt \\"true\\" and \\"real\\".  This book didn't quite achieve that for me.  However, to be fair, the later books in the series did have that effect on me, increasingly.  I think the Percy Jackson books get better and better as the series goes on.
B002QY9RMA|2.0|Sorry, but this album isn't wonderful, lacks intelligence. Their are a few songs that i like...\\"SWEET DREAMS\\"-cool song, \\"If I were a boy\\"-okay, \\"Halo\\"-yuck, \\"Video-phone\\"-SUCKS, oh the video is light porn, in her role--- Lady Ga-Ga, was cool..just terrible was Beyonce!!!!!<br />GOSH, WHY DID I BUY THIS ALBUM??? Her \\"Dangerously in Love\\" I have it. WAS MUCH BETTER, I don't get the over-sexed in her video's with this album???...maybe she's gotten more money hungry, grasping here---I just don't get it???<br />If I get low-rating from die-hard's, because of my review... more power to them. I am getting to the point, of not even giving her a second thought, on buying her products... Sorry, but Beyonce is acting like ghetto-trash in my opinion.<br />If you buy this more power to ya, but I wouldn't recommend, IT!!!!!!

After reading it, you can no longer use the excuse that you didn't know better.

Either way, everyone should be informed.<br /><br />There was probably a time when all the reasons in favor of eating animals were valid but now it's the 21st century.

B002PEP4U0|3.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this book for my Kindle, although I will admit that I noticed the high marks (5 stars) from the other reviewers.  So I decided to give it a try and see what the hype was about.<br /><br />For the first 10% of the book (Kindle doesn't have page numbers) I really was regretting the purchase.  The pages were filled with stories of William (main character) as a young boy and the various predicaments he found himself in.  The stories told of magic and witchcraft that caused all kinds of terrible things to happen and the overall direction of the book seemed to bounce back and forth from story or idea to another story or idea.  I found myself thinking that these stories were so farfetched, how is the remainder of the book going to integrate these magical tales.  At that point, I wasn't looking forward to reading more of the book.  Nevertheless I persevered and was happily rewarded.<br /><br />As William grows older (relatively speaking), the story - rather than witchcraft and magic - turns to real life events (famine and hardship) which actually brings you closer to William and his family.  Not that many of us can relate to devastating famine where it wipes out entire populations, but it does help us understand what William had to deal with during such a trying time.  Some touching moments are created in these pages and definitely rewards for turning the pages.<br /><br />Once William begins his journey of harnessing the wind, for me, this was the most interesting part of the book.  It truly was fascinating to me to not only learn how some of the things we take for granted (like electricity) can play such an integral role in communities that are essentially third world countries but also how one would go about constructing things with no money.  The inspiration and true reward which William finally receives for his hard work does make you want to stand up and feel proud - it's definitely a feel good moment to say the least.<br /><br />It was funny, as I was reading the first 10% of the book, I was going to give this review one star.  Then as I continued to read on, I planned on raising it to two stars and when I finished, it was three stars.  And while I agree that it could be given a true five star rating, portions of the book just seemed so distracting to me that it actually took away from the reading.  Again, this is a truly inspirational story and that alone is a five star rating but fold in much of the remaining passages and it loses some of it's luster - hence the three stars.<br /><br />Overall though, should you decide to pick up a copy, just know that if you're bored in the first pages, it will get better.as I was reading the first 10% of the book, I was going to give this review one star.

0877180121|5.0|This book is a great way to start young people on the piano.  It teaches the essentials of reading music, while allowing kids to progress quickly enough that they gain confidence in their ability to play.  I think you could probably muddle your way through teaching this to your kids even without any music background (of course it would be harder to play the accompaniments).<br /><br />I like to use this book with Teaching Little Fingers to Play for some variety in songs.  Together, they offer lots of choices in how kids can learn and progress.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation, [[ASIN:B000244F64 Emma (BBC, 1972)]] was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in [[ASIN:0767020308 Emma (A&E, 1997)]] which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of \\"Emma\\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.<br /><br />This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as [[ASIN:B0000SX9MS I Capture the Castle]],and [[ASIN:B000M2E32M Daniel Deronda]]. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.<br /><br />The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of \\"Mansfield Park\\"[[ASIN:6305907145 Mansfield Park (1999)]] which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in [[ASIN:B000T28Q00 Byron]].I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!<br /><br />The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and [[ASIN:B0001WTUJO Henry James' The Turn of the Screw]], [[ASIN:B00114XM04 The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version)]], as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in [[ASIN:B000M2E32M Daniel Deronda]] cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by  Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in [[ASIN:B000Z27HMW Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park]].<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and thescore is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).<br /><br />Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of \\"Emma\\" thus far!<br /><br />DVD features<br />Contains the scenes deleted from the PBS airing, and in addition:<br /><br />Emma's Locations - this nine-minute featurette focuses on the locations used during Emma's filming, and why these places were chosen.

This veteran actor is truly a great talent, and this interview covers his career from his early beginnings in the craft until today. It's more of a special focus on Gambon, not so much on his role in Emma, but it is a nice touch nevertheless.<br /><br />I did wish they had a director's commentary (I guess we'll have to wait for a special edition release for that, and spend more money!), and other cast interviews, sigh...but I'm happy to have the drama itself on DVD so that I can enjoy repeat viewings, and have an Emma adaptations marathon (the 1972 BBC adaptation, Kate Beckinsale's A&E adaptation, and of course, Paltrow and Jeremy Northam's pairing in the movie version).

B000021Y77|4.0|Since I first saw RUN LOLA RUN right aroung the same time as I did Michael Haneke's 1997 FUNNY GAMES, the two remain linked in my mind.  Odd in a way, since I love this movie--and have watched it several times--and had quite the opposite reaction to the Haneke film, to the point where I refused to consider seeing the American re-make from 2008.  But there was one significant aspect these two late-90s films shared: both films very deliberately called attention to the fact that they WERE indeed films: artificial representations of the real world, subject to authorial intervention and variation at almost any point in the plot.    Tom Tykwer's LOLA is, in many ways, an extremely self-conscisous film.  Its thrice-repeated basic plot, with extensive variations and elaborations, is a reminder that narratives can (and perhaps should) be subject to artistic manipulation or--as in Hollywood--to audience reactions at the test screenings.  \\"Don't like THAT ending? Try this one! Or this one.  We must have something here you'd like--and would pay seven bucks a pop to see.\\"  RUN LOLA RUN is a movie for anyone who's ever compulsively watched every single alt-ending provided on a DVD.  It works for the same reason that the various versions of any other narrative work.  Endings are seldom neat and always subject to change.  Any plot suggests its alternative versions, \\"What if?\\" says the audience, \\"What if?\\"    LOLA lets the viewer in on the secret--and, to extent, on the decision making.  This is a fiction, and you're not allowed to forget it.  There could be something depressingly Sisyphean about Lola's desperate 20 minute run, except that the camerawork, the editing and the music are so faced paced and compelling that it's easy to forget the desperate situaion Lola and boyfriend Manni find themselves in and just enjoy the ride.  After individual segments in which, first, Lola dies and, then, Manni does, we are primed and fully entitled to the fairytale happy ending the third segment brings.  This is less Nietzsche' \\"eternal return\\" than George Harrison's \\"with every mistake we must surely be learning.\\"    It is the exhilaration, the downright glee of possibility that keeps us engrossed in this hyperkinetic PoMo fairytale.  And that's probably the reason why I so preferred it to FUNNY GAMES.  The Haneke movie deliberately breaks from the narrative, tears down the fourth wall--or the moviehouse screen, if you prefer--about 3/4 of the way through.  In that grimly violent film, which seems to marching relentlessly to a violently conclusion, this break comes as a real break for the emotionally exhausted viewer.  But no sooner, does he break from the action than he picks right back up on it again.  This story, he seems to say, HAS to end this way.  It may be a fiction, but it must follow its own deadly internal logic.    That was a nihilistic stance if there ever was one.  By contrast, RUN LOLA RUN is almost sweetly Romantic.  Fates are not sealed here.  Fictions, like the real life that informs them, have infinite possibilities. all of which have an internal logic of their own.  Third time's a charm for Lola and Manni.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|As far as the story goes, this movie was just \\"okay.\\" I am a Quentin Tarantino fan and generally really like to watch his movies. When you watch this movie, you definitely can tell it is a Tarantino film. I really enjoyed the way the film was shot and the overall look of the film. I also enjoyed the \\"twist\\" on history as we know this story wasn't even close to what happened to the Third Reich.    Where this film lacked for me was in character development. Other than with Shoshanna, there was very little character development. I almost wish Tarantino had focused more on \\"The Basterds\\" than the story of Shoshanna. I didn't ever feel a connection with most of the characters and as such, didn't feel bad for anyone who died.    As far as the actual Blu-Ray copy is concerned, there are some nice features. You just have to be ready to wait 5-10 minutes for the disc to load. Other than that, this is a great 2-disc set.
B00004Y7SF|3.0|The problem of how very contemporary artists can pull off a Christmas album that is reflective of their style and their talent but also true to the holiday spirit is a thorny one, but it's nothing new.  Holiday standards are standards for a reason: they're comfy for most listeners, and they don't want them messed around with.  Still any singer worth his or her salt (and most who aren't for that matter) still want to put their own distinctive stamp on these standards.  Christina Aguilera's urban soul stylings are not the stuff most visions of sugarplums are made of.  There's nothing wrong, in theory, with a gospel style rendition of, say, \\"O Holy Night,\\" but it'd be nice to preserve at least a semblance of the original.  The version here though, suffers from much too much \\"too muchness.\\"  The standards are overkill--but then, the originals are too.  And most of those don't even have really distinctive melodies.      Despite all the melismatic meanderings, it's clear that Christina Aguilera's got a lot of chops. It's hard not to be impressed by her vocal prowess.  And from what I've heard and been given to understand, she has--in her late 20s--learned how to rein it in a bit better than she does on this now nearly decade-old release.  It's hard not to pull all your vocal tricks out of the bag when you're a kid.  When you're just starting out, the temptation to strut your stuff is hard to resist.  By all accounts, she's been learning a little something about taste and restraint over the years.  Good for her.  Maybe \\"Chistina's Christmas Pt. 2\\" will be the solid holiday album she's capable of.
B00006CXXU|4.0|For many artists, the pressure surrounding their sophomore album is considerably greater than for their debut. While many have worked on material for their debut for much of their life, the second album tends to be put out rather quickly to capitalize on the success of the first. Or, if the debut was poorly received, a second effort may be released to give an artist a second chance to start their career. Some combination of the two of these is often true of younger artists, like Christina Aguilera, whose debut was well-received, but not reflective of the kind of music the singer wanted. As such, her sophomore album seemed more experimental as Christina gained creative control and had a much bigger hand in crafting the material. The album shocked many fans, as it seemed to be a significant departure from her earlier work, but has come to be widely acknowledged as her best album to date.     \\"Stripped, Part I\\" opens the album with a part-spoken, part-sung interlude featuring Christina talking about how the album is about getting to know her better. Unlike most album intros, this one actually serves a purpose by introducing the theme of the album. It doesn't add much to the album necessarily, but is a nice touch. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is a definite female anthem, discussing double standards and calling women together to fight them. It's an excellent message and one that definitely needed to be said. The only real problem with the track is the annoying background chanting, which is not that noticeable at first, but hard to ignore once you hear it. \\"Walk Away\\" brings about an album highlight very early on, easily showing Christina in top form. It's a slow, melancholy, and very soulful track about being in a bad relationship that one can't leave. The lyrics are some of the strongest Christina has written, and her vocals are emotive and passionate. \\"Fighter\\" is another highlight, showcasing an angry Christina actually thanking a man for hurting her. The message here is thatby hurting her, he's only made her stronger. This track sounds just as fresh today as it did when the album came out. The bridge is especially stunning. The song as a whole is another anthem, and another that showcases an excellent message.     \\"Primer Amor Interlude\\" has Christina speaking in Spanish over a guitar, describing her first love. It's a beautiful interlude, and the Spanish sounds nice, although it's safe to say many fans won't really understand what she's saying. It does, however, transition smoothly into \\"Infatuation\\", a Latin-tinged track about Christina's real-life former boyfriend. This is another well-written track, capturing the mood impeccably. Here, she describes being caught between her mother's advice not to rush and her own feelings. \\"Love's Embrace Interlude\\" is somewhat evocative of Mariah Carey, with its airy sound. It really did not need to be a separate track, as it is very short and blends right into \\"Loving Me for Me\\". This track has Christina sing in a more subdued manner, about how what she loves most about her man is how he loves her for who she is. For many, this song makes a nice change from the way Christina \\"screams\\" most tracks, yet the power of her voice is always evident. The bridge once again is a highlight.     \\"Impossible\\" is another highlight, featuring Alicia Keys. This song has more of a jazzy sound to it, and contains some of the best lyrics the album has to offer. Christina's voice is showed to full effect here, powerful and passionate, yet never quite falling into the trap of oversinging. \\"Underappreciated\\" again explores Christina's relationship that had been mentioned in \\"Infatuation\\", this time from the other end of the scale. Christina here describes the problems with the relationship, as the man no longer seems to put in any effort. It's a rather common topic for songs, yet Christina manages to keep it sounding fresh and different. \\"Beautiful\\" is another track with an excellent message (although after seven years, the effects of it being overplayed have not quite dissipated). It is one of Christina's most successful songs, and with good reason. The lyrics are rather simple yet evocative, and the vocal delivery is simply stunning, building toward an empowering finale. \\"Make Over\\" is one of the few weaker points on the album, largely because it sounds out of place. There was some controversy about this song ripping off a track by the Sugababes, although the resemblance seems marginal at best. Christina's voice is a little too grating on the chorus, although the verses are good.     \\"Cruz\\" makes up for it, however, showcasing Christina's voice against a fairly sparse background. This is certainly one of the albums hidden gems, as a track that is generally overlooked until one listens to the album again. However, with that said, it does not quite measure up with the best the album has to offer. \\"Soar\\" is a rather inspirational song, with some gospel-sounding elements. Compared to other tracks here, it is a little on the forgettable side. It may be filler, but it is definitely filler at its finest. The bridge especially demonstrates this. It is quite a meaningful track, but gets lost among some of the other material. \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" on the other hand is a (rather controversial) highlight. This track has Christina singing about casual sex, but doing so in a very engaging way. This track goes along with her theme of female empowerment, showing how women can be confident and assertive about what they want. If we take image out of the equation and look at the song for what it is, it easily stands out as one of the most interesting tracks the album has to offer. \\"Dirrty\\" is another track in the same vein, although not quite as strong. The song is famous for launching Christina's new image, as the first single off this album. It's an extremely addictive song, which, like the previous track showcases Christina as a woman in control.     \\"Stripped Part 2\\" is another solid interlude, and continuation from the album opener. Here, Christina apologizes, albeit sarcastically, for not being what people expect of her. It is arguably unnecessary, but is a nice addition nonetheless. \\"The Voice Within\\" is another inspirational track about trusting oneself. This track shows off Christina's vocals incredibly, both in terms of their power and emotion. Like \\"Cruz\\", the instrumentation here is minimal, allowing the vocals and lyrics to shine. The build-up toward the rather climax is also handled nicely. \\"I'm OK\\" is easily the most personal track the album has to offer, where Christina recounts the abuse she witnessed and experienced in her childhood. According to interviews, she recorded this track while lying on her back in the studio. The track is quite haunting, with Christina sounding rather lost. This track may be keeping the theme of empowerment, depending on how its interpreted, as Christina sings \\"every morning when I wake, I look back at yesterday, and I'm OK\\". However, she sings these lines with such vulnerability that it's evident that she may not be that okay after all. Finally, \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" attempts to bring the album back to a more positive level, with mixed results. While the song is certainly empowering, it is at least a minute too long, causing it to drag. With the abundance of inspirational material already on the album, there were several stronger prospects to close off the album. Nonetheless, it is a solid track and makes for a nice album closer.     Overall Mark: 4.5/5    Although many were shocked with Christina's image during this album's era, it really is not such a far cry from her debut. The lyrics to a handful of tracks on her debut album were a little more racy than other pop singers, so it is not all that surprising that she shed the innocent image. Reputation aside, Christina had grown up in the years between albums, so it makes sense that her sound matured with her. A little too experimental at times, Strippedshowed Christina as a woman in control, both in the material and in crafting the album (she was involved in writing and composing all but two songs). The length of the album was both strength and its greatest downfall. Despite there being several outstanding tracks, the runtime also caused the album to drag in places. As such, the frequent changes in song style were welcome more often than not, as it prevented the material from becoming too repetitive. It also helped that production was generally kept to a minimum, allowing Christina plenty of room to shine, and keeping with the idea of being \\"stripped.\\" Although the vast majority of tracks addressed female empowerment, most did so in different and/or interesting ways, thus keeping attention. With Christina's talent both for singing and for songwriting, it is little wonder that the album came out so well.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I'm a sucker for sweeping epic, romantic, drama-ridden, war movies. This makes me easy prey for the seduction of \\"Australia\\". Set amid the dramatic backdrop of the world's largest island, the movie centers around Lady Sarah Ashley (played by Nicole Kidman whom I have a special attatchment to for thanks to her husband) and her cattle herder known as \\"The Drover\\" (played by the masculine Hugh Jackman). As Sarah tries to take over her dead husband's ranch in the outback, she is met with numerous obstacles including a corrupt cattle king who is seeking to monopolize the cattle industry, and her ranch manager who is secretly working for her opponent. I must say that David Wenham, who plays her traitor manager, does very poorly at his role. He's just too apparantely evil and sniveling. He was much better in 300. But anyways, Sarah must enlist the help of the Drover if her ranch is ever to survive and soon an improbable romance is ignited. But the gem that really sparkles in this film is the little aboriginal boy that Sarah decides to adopt in order to keep him safe from the government who exports the \\"half cast\\" children. But when the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor stage an air raid on Darwin, their worlds are all torn apart. I won't say any more because I don't want to ruin it for you. The ending is a little cliche but overall it was a good story. The two leads do a fantastic job together. I was especially impressed with Kidman who lended both humour and pathos to her role. The score was very good, using Over the Rainbow as one of its themes. The cinematography was stunning and effective. Even though it runs almost three hours long, I would encourage you to see it to form an opinion for yourself. You may not be blown away like I was. But then again, with its sweeping beauty, thrill, and emotion...well you just might be.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|This is my first S.M. album and I must say I was a little disappointed with it at first. Sarah seemed to flounder through the songs (which were mostly vague and nondefinative). Her voice is beautiful, liquid and melodic but not very strong. To be honest, I didn't really listen to the whole album until several months after purchasing it. But when I did I found some gems.   As is usually the case with any media (music, books, movies) the more you listen (or read or watch) the more you understand it and gradually begin to love it. Some of the songs began to stand out to me; among them Fallen, which was just a little too melodramatic and despairing for me; Stupid, with its slamming wall of guitars and ominous strings at the chorus; and epecially Answer, which soon became my favorite track and is actually fast becoming one of the most played songs on my ipod as I wake up to its peaceful, mellow piano and Sarah's silky voice every morning.    Altogether not a bad experience from Sarah and I will go on to buy more of her albums, but I wasn't blown away with this one. Even though I haven't really heard much else from her, I got the impression that she wasn't being herself, that she was experimenting and it didn't gel with her identity as an artist or as a person.
6302878624|5.0|A Classic... Edmund Gwenn IS Santa!  While the remake has its interesting moments, it pales in comparison to this 1947 movie (now gently colorized).  The color adds to the festive nature of the film, while still keeping its vintage charm.  The acting is well done and not cloyingly sentimental.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Let me start out by saying first off that I like my music! More so, I like a great live performance! This concert ranks right up there with some of the best I have seen. Many bands can make a good studio album. And the studio can make a good band sound better than they really are. I have spent lots of money over the years going to live concerts. Sometimes to find out that a band we thought was sure to give a good performance, was actually a snoozer. What a let down! I only own a few DVD concert videos-all of these include great live bands. This was my first Blu-Ray concert video purchase and I was blown away. All facets of this video were done close to perfection. I will name a few reasons why: The venue, the camera angles, lighting, special effects, set, fan interaction/participation, and most of all THE BAND! The sound was incredible!    I have always liked the Killers music, but never realized how diverse it was. Never even owned one of their albums before buying this concert footage. What turned me on to it was the fact that I heard \\"When you were young\\" on the radio. No, it wasn't the first time I'd heard the song, but it was the live version from the Royal Albert Hall concert. It sounded great live, and you could sort of feel the energy of the live show. After the song, I took note of where the live show was played at... Long story short, after checking out a short preview clip from another unnamed music store I found myself on Amazon looking to secure a Blu-Ray copy before the release! Glad I did. I have watched it 3 times with different people and they too were all wowed by the overall performance. All had the same comments-couldn't believe how good they really were. Sound even better live!    I recommend anyone to get this concert if you are on the fence. You won't be disappointed! If you have 1080 HD capabilities and a good sound system, go for the Blu-Ray!    -T
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I'm glad they are finally giving this amazingly filmed show a Blu-Ray release for it's second season and they are going back to release the first season on Blu-Ray as well. The second season of this AMC series starts right where the first dramatic season left off. From there it winds down a dark path where you can't see what's coming while still managing to up the stakes and get you more involved with the characters with each passing episode. While I wasn't quite prepared for where this season ended I have high hopes for the third season that will premiere this winter and highly recommend the first and second seasons to fans of well made television and certainly for fans of this series to rewatch it and notice things they've missed in first viewing. This 3-disc Blu-Ray set will contain the following episodes from season 2 of Breaking Bad (No Spoiler's):     Seven Thirty-Seven   Walt and Jesse try to end their deal with Tuco. Meanwhile, Hank attempts to repair Marie and Skyler's relationship.     Grilled   With Walt and Jesse trapped with Tuco, Marie and Hank comfort Skyler over his disappearance.     Bit by a Dead Bee   Walt and Jesse's become short on cash when they try to cover their tracks. Meanwhile, the DEA has a lead that could get them straight to Walt and Jesse.     Down   Walt attempts to reconnect with his family, while Jesse struggles to rebuild his life.     Breakage   Hank suffers from the aftermath of his encounter with Tuco. Meanwhile, Jesse hires a crew to get their product out on the streets.     Peekaboo   Walt's secret is in jeopardy when Skyler thanks Gretchen for paying for his treatment. Jesse tries to please Walt by 'manning up' and getting back some money that was lifted from one of their new crew, but he runs into complications.     Negro Y Azul   Rumors fly about Jesse's recent actions as he and Walt discuss expanding their business into new territories. Hank struggles to fit in with his new co-workers in El Paso. Skyler pursues a new job opportunity that reconnects her with a former colleague. Jesse gets to know his landlord, Jane     Better Call Saul   When Badger finds himself in trouble with the law, Walt and Jesse seek the legal advice of a shady attorney, Saul Goodman. The DEA believe they may have finally caught up with the elusive 'Heisenberg.' Hank returns to Albuquerque, but his troubled mental state and demeanor cause Marie to worry.     4 Days Out   Walt interrupts Jesse's weekend plans to inform his partner they'll have to cook for four days straight, or risk losing their batch of methylamine. Out in the desert things get heated between them when they wind up stranded.     Over   With Walt's disease in remission, the Whites throw a party for all those who've supported him through the ordeal, but the mood is ruined when Walt and Hank argue. Skyler is worried about Walt's emotional state as Walt tries various home improvement projects to occupy himself. Jane continues her relationship with Jesse but keeps this secret from her father.     Mandala   Saul suggests a new business partner for Walt. Skyler discovers something shocking at work. Jesse tells Jane about his 'job'. When an unreliable Jesse isn't there at a crucial moment, Walt must choose between an important moment in his familie's life or possibly scoring a big deal.     Phoenix   Skyler deals with newly developed family dynamic. Walter Jr. launches a new website to raise money for the family. Jane convinces Jesse to stand up to Walt. Walt makes a decision, or lack thereof, that sends him further down a path of darkness.     ABQ   Skyler's frustration with Walt's secrecy boils over; Jesse heads further down a path of self-destruction, and only Walt is willing to help him; and a grief-stricken Donald experiences more tragedy. Walt's recent poor decisions have a much larger negative affect on others than he could ever have anticipated.     'Seven Thirty-Seven' is an amazing season opener that leaves one anxiously awaiting the rest ofthe season. 'Grilled' provides a level of tension and excitement so high it leaves one wondering how the rest of the season will follow. While it does level out excitement-wise from there each episode is amazingly well crafted and dramatic from beginning to end. Other stand out episodes for me this season were '4 Days Out' and 'Mandala'. ABQ is also an incredibly well done season finale that leaves things in total chaos and wide open for the third season. Truly though, every episode stands out as excellently entertaining television making.     Special Features Announced For This Blu-Ray Release Include:    The Writer's Lab- An Interactive Guide to the Elements of an Episode. (Blu-Ray Exclusive)    Cast and Crew Commentaries (The First Season Commentaries were very informative and entertaining)    Inside Breaking Bad- 13 Featurettes About the Making of Each Episode.    11 Behind The Scenes Featurettes    6 Breaking Bad Original Webisodes    Walt's Warning Featurette    As Well As  Cop Talk With Dean Norris, Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel, \\"Negro Y Azul\\" Music Video, \\"Better Call Saul\\" Commercial, Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery, a Season 1 Recap and a Season 3 Sneak Peak.     This set is well worth the money with the amount of in depth bonus features you are getting along with the full season of 13 episodes as opposed to the first season set, which on account of the writer's strike, only had seven. These episodes are truly great televsion making and will certainly look great in High Definition. I highly recommend this set to any fan of well made television drama and obviously fans of this series. Thanks for your time.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|I saw this in the wonderful Moolah Theatre in beautiful downtown St. Louis, MO. To start with, the awesome speaker system there did nothing for the terrible sound quality of the movie. They may have wanted it to sound more like the filming was being done by a camcorder, but gritty muffling throughout did nothing but detract from the entire experience.    Another reviewer alluded to this movie as having the type of appeal that would attract eight-year-olds or those with eight-year-old intelligence levels (using much more degrading words, of course.) I wouldn't necessarily agree with that notion. On the contrary, the eight-year-olds and teenagers were the ones who were LAUGHING in the theater. NOBODY screamed until the last ten seconds.    The bore factor here was incredible. Time crawled by while two shallow characters, Micah and what's-her-name, dealt with a supernatural entity that was never seen. Hey, it's okay to not show the demon; I understand that that's supposed to be part of the fear factor, but saving the best part of the movie for the extreme end when it could have been introduced as a foundation early on and then built upon for additional scares was a HUGE golden opportunity missed by everyone involved. But that's not all as far as missed opportunities go...the whole thing with the psychic, or whatever that character was supposed to be, was flawed and underdeveloped. That individual situation could have been expanded upon to create a whole different angle and level to the movie.    So why all the hype, you ask? I have two theories. It may be one or the other, but its most likely a combination of both:    1. Exceptional marketing, whether deceiving or not! 'Nuff said.  2. When horror is presented in such a way that it is less about the grandiose, over-the-top, literally unbelievable, Hollywood presentation like \\"Poltergeist,\\" for instance, and more about something that is so subtle that it could actually happen to \\"YOU,\\" it opens the door for personal fears to creep through and subject the subconscious to a taste of a not-impossible reality.    That being said, I give the movie and its makers three stars for effort, but keep in mind viewers, MOST of this movie is VERY boring.    Three Stars ***
B003274QH6|5.0|First I want to say that this series is great and if you haven't seen it yet or are unsure about it, buying this affordable set is a great way to test it out with the first seven episodes now available in high def. If you like those episodes or if you're one of the people who already love this series then this Blu-Ray Set is for you. It contains the complete first season of AMC's Breaking Bad in seven one hour long episodes.     In short the plot is a more serious Bryan Cranston than we've seen playing chemistry teacher Walter White, who gets diagnosed with cancer. With a son, Walter Jr, who is disabled and a wife, Skyler, who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students, Jesse. The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.     The episodes found on this set are:     Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer. With a new lease on life, Walter becomes a drug dealer to secure his family's financial security.   Aired: 1/20/2008     Ep 2: Cat's in the Bag... - Following their debacle in the desert, Walter and Jesse are left with a mess to dispose of. Later, Skyler grows suspicious of Walt's recent activity.   Aired: 1/27/2008     Ep 3: ...and the Bag's in the River - Walter is left to deal with Krazy-8 alone following an argument with Jesse. After Marie raises concerns that Walt Jr. is smoking cannabis, Hank shows him the dangers of drug use.   Aired: 2/10/2008     Ep 4: Cancer Man - The DEA becomes suspicious of a new drug kingpin. Walt reveals that he has cancer to Marie and Hank. Elsewhere, Jesse visits his estranged family.   Aired: 2/17/2008     Ep5: Gray Matter - Walter and Skyler attend a former colleague's party. Jesse tries free himself from the drugs. Later, Skyler organizes an intervention for Walt.   Aired: 2/24/2008     Ep 6: Crazy Handful of Nothin' - The side effects of chemo begin to plague Walt, who is also cooking meth again. Jesse's friend, Skinny Pete, introduces him to a distributor named Tuco, but things go awry and Jesse ends up hospitalised.   Aired: 3/2/2008     Ep 7: A No-Rough-Stuff Type Deal - Walter accepts his new identity as a drug dealer after a PTA meeting. Elsewhere, Jesse decides to put his aunt's house on the market, and Skyler is the recipient of a baby shower.   Aired: 3/9/2008       Special Features Included In The Set Are:    Commentaries on episodes one and six by actor Bryan Cranston (Walter White), series creator Vince Gilligan and the largest commentary cast of actor's I've ever heard with everyone on the show from Aaron Paul (who plays Jesse) to RJ Mitte (who plays Walter Jr.).    Making of Breaking Bad: A Behind The Scenes Featurette.    Inside Breaking Bad: Interviews with cast and crew reveal how they make the series and all the attention to detail that goes into making it realistic as possible.    AMC Shootout Interviews: Interviews/Discussions with Bryan Cranston, Vince Gilligan and others taken from the AMC Shootout show.    There are also Deleted Scenes, A Photo Gallery, Actor Screen Tests and A Breaking Bad Commercial.        I feel this show and the quality being put into it will help make it the next version of the Wire, while Mad Men is more like the equivilant to the next version of Sopranos yet both shows are something entirely of their own. I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try. Breaking Bad's first season barely broke the surface of these character's and the storyline possibilties they hold. Thanks for your time.
0061914177|5.0|Thanks to a rare snow storm in Richmond, VA this past week, I finally found the time to read Gary Vaynerchuk's book \\"Crush It\\".  Gary convincingly outlines how to live your passion and be true to yourself.  This book inspires the reader to discover his or her passion and then work hard, research, exercise patience, and the success will follow.  With success, he promises that the reader will experience fun and fulfillment because you will be doing what comes easy.  For me this book re-energizes the entrepreneurial spirit that is the basis of our country.  Living in the United States where we have the freedom to follow our passions and explore our talents, Gary gives us new and affordable ways for building a personal brand and creating a legacy.  Gary reminds us that the sky is the limit for those who want to \\"crush it\\" here in the land of opportunity.<br /><br />Three rules that Gary says he lives by are:<br />1. Love your family<br />2. Work \\"superhard\\"<br />3. Live your passion<br /><br />Gary discusses what forms of social media work for him and why.  He gives other options and platforms, and includes emerging media.  Overall I feel his simple and direct critiques of the media platforms he uses very helpful.  I trust his judgment as a frontiersman of new media.  I appreciate his easy to follow check lists for \\"making the world listen.\\"<br /><br />As a Business Coach, some of the most important entrepreneurial lessons I agree with Gary on are:<br />* Identify your passion<br />* Choose your platform<br />* Build your personal brand<br />* Roll with it<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from the book is, \\"it is never a bad time to start a business, unless you are starting a mediocre business.\\"  Gary then says that, \\"the person who can dominate during rough times, is a person who can dominate, period.\\"  Bravo Gary!  Become an authority on what you love and find a way to make others notice and appreciate your expertise, and there is no way you can lose.<br /><br />I will definitely recommend \\"Crush It!\\" to my clients who are considering starting a small business.  Gary's energy and enthusiasm are infectious.  His recommendations for blogging, filming, tweeting and creating community are invaluable.  Most importantly, this easy read will give the entrepreneur quick guidance without the time commitment of burdensome prose.considering starting a small business.

B001NY43L4|4.0|Someone said that you have to see just one of them. There is no doubt ... REC is an excellent film and Quarentine doesn't have the feeling and reality of REC. I saw REC in DVD (excellent quality video) and in blu-ray I think it will be fantastic!<br />Obs: I'm changing my review today (02/15/2010) ... Here in Brasil I rented REC in Blu-ray this month (february)... It's is very good !!! Forget the DVD ...
0345350499|5.0|I loved this book.  At first I thought it was an original and imaginative retelling of the Arthurian legend from the female perspective.  It is that and so much more.  The book actually has many layers to it, one of most prominent being the conflict of Christianity and paganism and how blind devotion to one or the other leads to ruination of all.  The detailed description of life on Avalon was just fascinating.  The characters were fully developed and the author did an excellent job of fleshing out the psychology and motivation of the characters.  The arc of character development of Morgaine was particularly startling and her realization about the everlasting and ubiquitous nature of the goddess was one of the most satisfying ending to a book.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I have seen this movie several times in-theater, DVD and now BluRay. I can definitely say that watching it @ 1080p was a totally awesome feeling. Crisp picture quality and detailed sound with dts-HD.    Much has been said about the movie and the quality/attention to detail of this classic so I will refrain from boring you with the awesomeness. Definitely recommend this awesome movie on high definition.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|What can I say?  If you are a Killers fan, you will love the DVD and CD -- if you're not a Killers fan, you probably will be after listening!!  This is an amazing set, the Killers are such great performers that watching the DVD is second only to being there!  I was also very pleased with the selection of music, which covers ALL of their albums!  The Killers REALLY rock live.  :)
B000002JPA|5.0|This album just sparks and ignites tons of emotions just by listening to it. It is amazing the way they smoothly transition from various signatures, into a full blown masterpiece.     1. Pull Me Under (8/10) Even though it is one of their most popular songs, I still find it incredibly exciting to listen to. It has a great chorus, along with some great lyrics everyone must love.    2. Another Day (9/10) LaBries vocals are spot on with this one. You feel his emotion coming through your speakers when he sings the verses. A great song all around.    3. Take The Time (7/10) I love this song, but I can't say its the best off the album. It is great, but while the lyrics are good, there are few rhymes, which makes the song a little harder to fall in love with. Great drums by Mr. Portnoy however, and the bass sounds really good too.    4. Surrounded (10/10) I absolutely love this song. The signature that it is in just feels so natural, and LaBrie has his best vocal performance ever in this song, IMO. The guitar solo is trippy, and the way the song ends is just perfect, nothing more you can ask for.    5. Metropolis - Part I (9.5/10) A Great song all around. Great keyboard work here.    6. Under a Glass Moon (11/10) My all-time favorite Dream Theater song. The intro is amazing, and when the drums come in you can just feel the pressure building up, and it all leads into the most explosive chorus ever. \\"Outside the soundness of your mind... Bathing your soul in silver tears...\\" Just makes me shiver, and I feel as if I need to sing along every time I hear this song. Great guitar solo, possibly one of the best from Petrucci, as he does perfect clean, crisp sweeps near the end of the solo. If I had to invision a perfect song, this would be it.    7. Wait For Sleep (4/10) I almost want to skip this song just to get onto Learning To Live. Just boring for me, but that's just me.     8. Learning To Live (10/10) Great closing track. The keyboard part from Wait For Sleep in the middle of this song is great, the way it's played on a keyboard instead of a piano. The \\"Woaaahhh's\\" from LaBrie is probably some of the hardest notes to hit, and the way he sings them so naturally is just great.     If you had to buy one album on Amazon, and you couldn't decide between this, or Awake, or even Octavarium, this is the way to go. This tops any album by some of my other favorite bands, including Queensryche, Fates Warning, and other Progressive Metal bands from around the same era.
B002YP4EPG|4.0|Technology is wonderful these days. You can do anything, including recording at your own house. Steve actually recorded this album in his living room with the help of his keyboard player Rodger King.The guest stars are Chris Squire, Anthony Phillips and more. Steve's writing is outstanding on this one. The lyrics have a more personal approach than previous albums. The music speaks itself. From the music box beginning, to an anthem chorus and guitar solo of Fire on the Moon; to  a flamingo spanish jam session Nomads. This song is where Steve should do more of. His spanish guitar playing is outstanding!! The song Tubeheads is ana all out jam session. The song also features a very talented Chris Squire hammering away like a jack hammer.The rest of the album is very good, even Anthony Phillips twelve string guitar makes an appearence on Emerald and Ash. Even though there is nothing new, this is still vintage Steve Hackett. The song Sleepers is different than most of his recordings. Trade mark rythem and mood changes throughout the song make this one a stand out. The last three are not bad either. Steve has been on a mideastern swing The song The Last Train to Istanbul with its violin and the ever intersting drums will keep the train rolling. All in all , I highly recommend this album.From the die hard to the new fan or the guitar enthusiast.

0451530845|4.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.<br /><br />And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").<br /><br />The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.<br /><br />Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.<br /><br />Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight.ming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\").

Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight.
B000000WG4|5.0|This is only scary because it is associated with the Exorcist film. My initial criticism of this is that the run time is almost an hour. The 3:20 radio single edit, I would personally rate as easily one of the top 20 rock instrumentals of all time.  Unless I am mistaken, the version on the Pure Moods and other hits collections is NOT the original radio edit.  I had the 45 RPM single and wanted a CD version of that, and finally did find a promo copy of the radio edit. An LP record at over 50 minutes is pushing the limit of the media, however, with a CD holding over 70 minutes why they did not put the single edit on the CD is beyond me.  At least Iron Butterfly included the single version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida on their CD, and it is nice to have both the 3 minute radio version and the almost 20 minute jam version in the same place. To me excessive length adds nothing and more often detracts, however, the parts 1 and 2 (original LP sides 1 and 2) really have nothing at all to do with each other and could have been separate titles. Approaching the 2 tracks as separate pieces actually makes them more enjoyable and I rarely listen to both one after the other. This has been very influential in many ways (the brief growling vocals immediately come to mind) and predates Tangerine Dream’s breakthrough, Phaedra. They would perfect and advance these lengthy pieces that drift from one theme to the next seamlessly, but they never had a big radio hit like Mike Oldfield did.  Also check out Ennio Morricone’s Heretic theme to the follow up Exorcist II, an equally great composition, and very rocking.
159308336X|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - especially in IMAX 3-D as it is meant to be seen - is in for not only an epic movie - but a true breakthrough in movie-making historic technology.    And James Cameron does it with aplomb. He doesn't forget to give you a character-driven, explosive action-filled epic along the way. Most directors would be lost in just the special effects. Not Cameron. He gives you everything!    That's why the Box office sales are going through the roof.    So please, don't listen to those few bad reviews. They obviously are either purely false, just to stand out, or they are the typical paper reviewer who wouldn't know a great movie if they tripped over it. If you leave AVATAR without feeling some kinf of pump-up exileration, you just don't have a hearbeat.    Sure James Cameron borrowed from classics. There are tones of everything from Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan to historic tones like those of Native Americans walking the Road of Tears. But Avatar still manages to stay fresh and true of its own accord.    There are several messages to this beautiful film that certainly ring true for today's movie-going audience. WE MUST STAY GREEN.    But after watching this fil 4 times now, it never gets old to feel like I'd rather be a 10-foot blue Avatar Na'Vi than a nearly 6-foot human any day of the week.     Without a doubt, AVATAR is going to run away with numerous Oscars. And it should.    Goodbye Titanic.     Hello Avatar!     Trust me, its more than a great movie.     It is an experience.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I noticed several reviews where folks complained about the sound. The discs preselect 7.1 DTS-HD MA as the audio option. I suppose there was some rational for this but for those of us without fancy sound systems, selecting the Original 2.0 Mono under \\"Communications\\" / \\"Audio Options\\" provides for excellent sound quality whereas the preselected 7.1 DTS-HD will sound weak and distorted if played without the sound system to support it. I admit it is a little tedious to do this each time you load the disc, but it does resolve any sound quality concerns. I have to say that regardless, I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this Blu-ray version of the original series. The \\"enhanced\\" visual effects are great and not too overdone. Fear not the concerns about sound quality and enjoy!

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Pink Floyd's Pulse Tour in 1994 was a must see. I saw the show in the Louisiana Superdome and still remember it to this day. When I heard the Earl's Court show was finally being released on DVD I figured that this was a must have. For purists the show was kind of a mixed bag. Would the band be able to pull this off wothout Roger Waters? For those of us who saw the show the answer was yes. Watching the DVD adds to the nostalgic mood.     The DVD presents the show in the best restoredc version that it can due to limitations in the source material for the times. The 4:3 picture works fine for the most part and the 5.1 Sound while not perfect captures the mood of the show. I found that the surrounds really did not come into play on this DVD. The selection of material was good. The first half of the show focused on newer material and the second disc presented a live version of Dark Side of the Moon in its complete form.    The bonus materials (like on all David Gilmore produced projects) were quite extensive. We get all of the concert screen films including alternate versions, a segment called Bootlegging the Bootleggers featuring four more performances, videos of two songs, maps and stage art, a making of documentary and and the induction of the band into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame by Billy Corgan.    After so many changes to the band and in music in general this is a great DVD to have even with its flaws. It was well worth the wait.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|How often do YOU feel at odds with the world?  How often do YOU feel like taking things into your own hands and exacting the kind of 'justice' 'THEY' deserve?  Well, if you feel like me (sometimes), THIS is the movie you have always wanted to be part of.  Ok, maybe Douglas' character DOES go a bit 'over the top', but you can sympathize with a man who just  wants to 'go home', if only the rest of the world will get out of his way and leave him alone.  The fact that he has a restraining order (due to a temper and a half) doesn't seem to deter him from going to celebrate his little girl's birthday.  I don't want to give TOO much away but there is a fantastic part that involves a phone box - \\"I think it's out of order\\".  Suffice to say, that Douglas IS the man pushed to the brink by EVERYDAY things - and people.  He plays the part to perfection, as do most of the cast. The movie is dark but funny in places, but mainly it is a 'feel good' movie IN REVERSE.  It deals with all the stupid pitiful things that annoy the rest of us - like 'road works' that really don't need to be. (You'll love how he deals with THAT!)  Above all, he is just a man, like you and me, but a man who really is still used to another era, before it all got caught up in the rat race of everyday 'life' and circumstance, notwithstanding he has just lost his job. I think I'd be angry too.   Another favourite scene of mine is the fast food restaurant. Great stuff!!  I could watch this movie over and over. I think you will too. Enjoy!!

B00007BKVC|4.0|I saw Thelma and Louise for the first time in December of 2009. I found the first viewing so compelling that not only did I view the deleted scenes and alternate ending, over the next several days I also watched it through both commentaries, then the whole movie two more times again. Less than a hand full of times in my life have I ever even cared to watch a movie more than once.<br /><br />One reason I avoided it for all these years is that I think I had always envisioned T&L as perhaps a modern female equivalent Butch Cassidy, et al, type of bad girl shoot-em-up, or maybe some anti-male, female rampage-to-the-end. It's not that at all. Two otherwise middle class, middle-of-the-road, fairly attractive, rather uptight, southern women in their late-thirties who are best friends decide to take a weekend vacation trip together, ostensibly to get a much needed break from their respective less-than-fulfilling relationships.<br /><br />Before ever arriving at their destination, things start to go wrong, terribly wrong, with the resultant desperado flight into oblivion that is a direct result of 1) being female in a subtly but pervasively misogynistic society, 2) making poor, but crucial, decisions as events unfold, and 3) an underlying history that becomes alluded to along the way, directly resulting from 1) and contributing significantly to 2).<br /><br />I found the film score quite fitting throughout, especially the instrumental segues and interludes, which added a moody, melancholy vibe. And visually, much of the cinematography was quite striking, especially as they neared The End. (The last part was shot in the Canyonlands of Utah I believe it was.)<br /><br />I think what I really liked about it was how the two women metamorphosed from \\"who they were\\" to \\"who they became\\" in their short but epic journey.<br /><br />That said, though I do see metaphors within the story that are worthy of contemplation, I don't think this is some \\"feminist manifesto\\" or that there is any hidden \\"moral\\" to the story, and I appreciate many of the points put forth in some of the negative reviews here. I simply found it highly entertaining fiction, as any good movie experience should be.<br /><br />There are definite \\"flaws.\\" (Hence, the four stars instead of five.) Some supporting rolls seemed a bit mis-cast (or, more accurately, grossly mis-acted). Periodically there are off-the-wall things going on in the background that just don't add up. There is at least one scene that simply wouldn't have happened in the \\"real world,\\" and at least one scene that seemed put in just to add comic relief. All of which gives it a quality that I find makes the whole thing a bit surreal. On the other hand, overall the \\"flaws\\" didn't bother me much, and in some respects the whole surreal quality added a little something that in its absence might've made T&L less than what it turned out to be.nd I appreciate many of the points put forth in some of the negative reviews here.

0783225857|2.0|The film begins with a child opening a box with toys that dates this story to the 1930s. The lawyer takes his payment in goods, cash is scarce. This little girl seems to be a tomboy. The kids are warned about the local maniac chained in his house. There is an old lady who is cranky. We hear the family history. People don't dress for the hot weather. The Judge asks Atticus Finch to represent a defendant. These kids just wander around (to present a view of life). Does anyone watch them? That lady does not wear a hat and gloves. \\"Scout\\" seems to have a behavior problem. Atticus tells about his first gun. He tells \\"Scout\\" about the need for proper deportment in school.     Then a mad dog appears in the street. Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot. Later he meets the wife of the defendant. A man shows up for a scary scene. Jem finds a trinket. \\"Scout\\" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.     Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime. The defendant has a lame left arm. Was this crime due to the violation of society's rules. Can the word of a Negro be taken against two white people? Finch asks for justice for his client. The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.     Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice? [Would Atticus want his child to be friends with a grown man who has emotional problems? This ending damages the story.] I wonder if \\"Scout\\" will have problems as an adult?
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I LOVE Alicia Keys.  She is a talented class act.  This CD is not a good as her last one, As I Am, but it's pretty decent.  Most of the songs have the same tempo so some of them sound the same.  Put it in a Love song (duet with Beyonce) is really catchy and has that Beyonce sound.  My favorite song on the album is Un-thinkable (I'm Ready).  Other good ones are Love is Blind, Doesn't Mean Anything, Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart, Love is My Disease, Like the Sea, Through it All, and Pray for Forgiveness.

B000BO0LKY|5.0|Mariah has still got it.  I would definately recommend spending the few extra bucks for the platinum edition.  I loved this CD so much I bought the platinum one after I had already purchased the first original CD.  Stay the Night and Joy Ride are my favorites.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Normally I read a Dan Brown book in a 1 ½ days, 2 days tops.  They grab you from the first page and it is a rollercoaster ride to the end.  I love the short chapters and while I can get annoyed with the jumping back and forth between characters and plot lines between chapters, it is only because I am so anxious to find out what will happen next.  I have missed cooking meals for my family and going to bed at a decent hour.  However that said it was not the case with this book.  While the book started off in the usual exciting Dan Brown fashion, it quickly declined into a mishmash of a plot that was wholly disinteresting.  Not only was I able to go on with my life, I was totally disinterested in the lives of the characters, not to mention to took several days to read the book.      Robert Langdon, the every irrespirable, always entertaining professor from Harvard was a mess throughout this book.  He was totally off his game; stumbling from one landmark to the next.  It was sad and pathetic.  The plot was interesting but the connection to the Mason was forced at best.  The entire story could have been done without the Mason connection and the Noetic science portion.   Worst of all was the ending.  The last few chapters after Dan Brown dispensed with the \\"bad guy\\" was beyond pointless.  I know he was attempting to wrap everything up in a neat little bow, but this package arrived DOA.    While Dan Brown is not the greatest author in the world, he has written far superior novels than this; in particular, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\" to name a few.  I hope he goes back to the technical or religious topics he excels at.  PS - note to Dan Brown - get a new team of editors - this team left in too much minutiae.

B000005DSN|5.0|\\"Visions\\" is the first album by Stratovarius that I got, and honestly, it's a great one. I wish more bands like these would get popular here in the States, but regardless, \\"Visions\\" is a great metal album.    Highlights for me include the majestic, slow-paced \\"The Kiss of Judas\\", the high-speed, guitar-and-keyboard madness of \\"Black Diamond\\", the riff-heavy, super-melodic \\"Forever Free\\", the hauntingly beautiful acoustic ballad \\"Before The Winter\\", and the headbanger-masterpiece \\"Legions\\". Of course, the other five songs on here are great as well. In fact, each of the ten songs show off the incredible musical and vocal talents the band has to offer, along with a mystical and somewhat yearning vibe demonstrated through the vocals and lyrics. Overall, it's a feast for the ears that shows it's a perfect balance of heaviness, softness, melody and aggression.    In a time when drop C-tuning and breakdowns are the stereotype of metal music, this album is able to separate itself from the crowd and stay true to the beauty of power metal. Highly recommended for fans of the power metal subgenre. Keep rockin'! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|I'm a big fan of Alicia Keys so I hate to speak/write negatively of anything she produces.  But this album has some issues.<br /><br />I applaud what is essentially twelve love songs bookended by an intro and an outro ode to New York City, but I think any artist would have a hard time sustaining an entire album across a single theme.  I don't think the idea was wrong.  Most songs attempt to shed light on love and heartbreak in some form after all.  But at a certain point there is the risk of losing boldness (and soul!) and producing something contrived.  And that's the trap this album falls into.  It's a lot of love song fluff with uninspired beats.  \\"Love Is My Disease\\" is a particularly painful example of prosaic sub-mediocrity.<br /><br />There are some positives.  \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" really is a fantastic track, and a great single for air play.  The first two tracks, \\"Love Is Blind,\\" and \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" are also a sample of Alicia on top of her game.  \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II)\\" is a great compliment to Jay-Z's record.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it's almost seven years later, and The Diary of Alicia Keys continues to see the most action on my iPod.  It remains, in my opinion, her strongest effort to date.  This album is her worst, but naturally with Alicia, not completely beyond recall.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Sonata Arctica represents all that is great about European power metal: The fast tempos, energetic drums, crazy guitar riffs, blazing solos, soaring vocal melodies, mystical keyboard highlights and interesting-as-ever lyrics. All of that is presented in its utmost glory here on \\"Ecliptica\\". This album is a nice slab of true power metal, and shows the band can do both an uptempo headbanger and a beautiful ballad. My personal favorite on the album is \\"Kingdom For A Heart\\", a gorgeous anthem with some insane riffs and solos, a beautiful after-solo section, and an overall romantically yearning mood. The rest of the songs on here are great, as well. Highly recommended for fans of power metal! Thanks for the time, and peace.
044654146X|4.0|It's quite refreshing to read a book that deals with Israel as a legitimate, normal member of the community of nations and doesn't dwell endlessly on the Palestinian-Israeli issue. Senor and Singer compare and contrast Israel to the United States, Singapore, Dubai, South Korea, and other nations and ask: Why has this tiny nation amassed such an outstanding record in high-tech, especially in the area of start-ups?<br /><br />One may agree or disagree with their answers, which generally relate to Israeli \\"can-do\\" culture, the lack of hierarchy or formality in that nation, the Israeli military's history of successful improvisation in responding to difficult operational problems, and a burst of creativity immediately after the end of a period of economic stagnation. But this book does a great service in helping technologists, business people, and ordinary readers understand the secrets of Israeli success, which can be duplicated elsewhere.<br /><br />It's not clear that Ben-Gurion and other founders of Israel, who were steeped in the socialist ethic, can legitimately be reinvented by Senor and Singer as capitalist icons. And the book is a bit repetitious and too long. However, it's an excellent read and a terrific new look at what makes Israel tick.

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I've become a fan of the Killers over the past year, and they are proving to be the heir apparent to the likes of U2 and Bruce Springsteen.  It's clear they made an investment in producing a state of the art concert film here, and in effect have set a high bar for other bands to reproduce.  The visuals are stunning within Royal Albert Hall, with the cameras taking you on a journey from an empty venue to them taking the stage.  The sound is amazing, and if you have a surround system, THIS IS the benchmark for testing out your system.  Their body of work holds up well over the whole concert.  No duds, but for me, some new thoughtfully written songs that I now know!      One review I read online by a music critic compared this to Elvis Presley's Hawaii concert film.  A very good comparison.  However, The Killers, benefit from digital technology that perfects the experience.

Not long after that my daughter gave my a picture with her little boy's handpaints and it said \\"I'll like you for always...I'll love you for always...forever and ever my \\"Bamaw\\" (which is what he calls me) you'll be!  It still sits in a place on honor and every time I look at it I cry and wish he was still that tiny little guy.....he just turned 10!!!

It's not worth spending the extra dough. The \\"freeze dried\\" santa hat wouldn't even fit on my french bulldog.    Coasters, fake snow, moose shot glass...not worth it.    The movie looks great in hi-def, but c'mon folks...you can't polish this christmas turd(and Warner Brothers didn't even try).    It is what it is........A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!     Funny as hell no matter what format you watch it in.    For your money, buy the regular Blu-Ray and hope you get a green case.    Bardo
B000024EXY|5.0|Second's Out. LOOK OUT! It's time for me to lengthily bloviate!<br /><br />Man, it was the first time music ever moved me. Listening to it with headphones on in the darkness of my bedroom at age 13, in 1977. Pretty much every night for almost a year! The keyboards were magical, the drumming, the guitar work, the songs, so transporting and original. ELP got me into the chops-side and the mind-blowing possibilities of a rock band first, but Genesis, especially Phil Collin's warm, smoky vocals, the wondrous keyboard sounds, the duel drumming that just lifts songs into the stratosphere, the guitars soaring, and just the cumulative sound that the band had created that equally is warm and smoky. Nobody sounded like Genesis. It's like they took the magic of Yes and King Crimson and removed the always-trying-to-impress instrumental solos that could occasionally take you out of the song, and just kept it about the song, the overall song.<br /><br />If you look at the cover of Second's Out, a stage shot, there is the band surrounded by white stage lights coming down like a screen, with fog enveloping them, as if they're on an English moor in the dark of night, and their music SOUNDS like what that photo looks like somehow. All of the stage photos included in the artwork, and in the entire 1973-2007 LIVE Box Set, do. It's like they didn't need Roger Dean's artwork to create visual worlds to accompany the music you heard. (Don't get me wrong, I love everything about Yes and Roger Dean's artwork, for different reasons) One mere photo of Genesis on stage seems to sum up the musical equivalent of the album, and their live shows, perfectly.<br /><br />Nick Davis and crew did an oustanding job of remixing what to me was already a sacred work of art, 1977's Second's Out, recorded in Paris in 1976 and 1977. I was afraid they'd mess with Phil's vocal performance, mixed a bit low in the original release, which in a way, had him even more in the sound of the performance. Well, actually now I can hear how transcendent Phil's performance was even better. I am somehow even more impresseed, and it does not overtake or overshadow anything. The drums thunder and clap around the mix as they should, especially when Phil and Chester Thompson play together, Mike Rutherford's bass and Moog pedals thunder in songs they really need to (Afterglow, late Firth of Fifth, Musical Box, Supper's Ready, Dance On a Volcano, Los Endos), Tony Bank's keys anchor and shimmer brightly to punctuate and lead the music again, and best of all, Steve Hackett is back up in the mix where he always belonged.<br /><br />From the stick-click count-off of the first song, Squonk, you feel the melancholy beauty of what they do best. And what struck me is they played these songs with such conviction. Other bootleg live recordings show how tight and consistent they were with the magic. But Second's Out has the ultimate version of every song on it. Perhaps my biggest factor in making this version the only version of Second's Out I'll listen to from here on in is Steve's aforementioned resurrection. Because he's so frickin' original, and he has his power back. With a band like Yes, you marvel at Steve Howe's guitar virtuosity and solo creativity, but also how well he falls into the band's sound. But even then you hear him sticking his head up and out in many of the tunes, like, it's Howe's turn to solo, and now it's Wakeman's, etc.<br />Hackett rarely 'solos' and when he does, like on Firth of Fifth, or parts of Supper's Ready, he soars with that smoothly, wailing and sometimes sinister Les Paul. He really makes Supper's Ready (Genesis masterpiece, on par with Yes' Close to the Edge, or Floyd's Dark Side) the epic rock work that it is on this album's version, and now I can hear him better. I could sit down with you and play Supper's Ready ( a 20 minute long song) specifically the Second's Out version,  and show you how Hackett makes that song a masterpiece in every section. The same with Firth of Fifth and Cinema Show. It is Genesis. And his classical guitar skills elevate so much of their stuff, like the beginning of Cinema Show, on 12-string. You can hear Hackett constantly creating new sounds on the guitar in Genesis' early work, never more than on SO. He was one of the first to just scrape at the strings, make them sound like cauldron bubbles(Dance), water trickling (Cinema Show), siren's wailing (Supper's Ready: Guaranteed Eternal Sancuary Man), seagulls screaming (Firth of Fifth, Cinema Show), dogs barking (Supper's Ready again, Apocalypse in 9/8) somehow. Bizarre soundscapes that were perfect at setting the moods. Genesis could sound like medieval Britain, rainy day English countryside, or occasionally, sinister, apocalyptic and even insane.<br /><br />And Hackett would just non-chalantly innovate stuff in the background from stage right while Tony Banks would take the spotlight, stage left. Steve was so soft-spoken and humble. To this day, he speaks with quiet pride about his work with Genesis. He's not bitter, or sniping, even 33 years on since leaving the band. He calls them his dear friends. The epitome of classy, reserved Britishness.<br />On a side note, it totally thrills me that he will be inducted into the R-n-R Hall of Fame this year. (As well as Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks and Michael Rutherford, Ant Phillips, etc.) Because many of those guitarists inducted into the RnR HOF are showboats. And they belong in there, obviously. But the fact that someone like Hackett, such a class act, and so innovative, inspirational and influential (and after all, isn't that what the HOF is for, achievement and influence?) himself on guitar, and even the same can be said about Genesis as a whole, can join the RnR HOF is such a kick to me. Even if he's there by proxy because of the careers of Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel.<br /><br />IMO, Genesis \\"Second's Out\\" alone is one of the only albums one needs to hear to consider Genesis worthy of any Rock-n-Roll Hall Of Fame. And this remastered version is the one to listen to.Genesis. And his classical guitar skills elevate so much of their stuff, like the beginning of Cinema Show, on 12-string.

B002R68U7K|4.0|This Singles Collection it's definitely what a Britney fan needs to have, it includes (almost) all of the singles she released through her 10 years on the music scene and also a DVD with her iconic music videos and a glossy paper booklet which shows images from her videos and fun facts about every single, like worldwide chart peaks, release dates and some more.      To be honest, this is what I expected, but at the same time, it is not. Let's get started with the box itself, it's simple but cool, which it's not bad, but it is too small and tight and it's kinda hard to put the cds back on after you pull them off the box, it should be a little (just a little) larger so we don't have to pres the cds so hard to close it. The singles come in a cardboard sleeve with all the original art and every cover and CD comes with a collectors number (which I think it's awesome), now the CDs have all the same art printed on them and it's kinda boring, I actually thought that the CDs will also have their original artwork printed on them, I think it would have been great if they had it too.     Also, every single have only two music tracks, I rather rip them on my computer and play all the tracks on my iPod instead of changing the CDs every 8 minutes. But I actually didn't buy this collection to play the music on them (I have them all already), I did it because of the meaning that it has for a collector and a fan of Miss Spears. You'll see, not all of her singles are released in most of the countries, so this is like a treasure box for most of us.     To conclude, I give this collection 4 out of 5 stars. The music in it it's perfect as always and shows the history that Britney Spears has as a Pop Icon, you can definitely see and hear her evolution as an artist, her work it's admirable and I think we'll have more from Britney in the years to come. The only bad note that this item has it's, let's say, its last-minute made design, which should have been, a little bit, better worked out.Britney and her fans deserve it, I mean, it's been 10 years!, it's a BIG celebration to the BIGGEST Pop Icon of our days!, You heard that, JIVE Records??.    Final note: \\"A must have for any Britney Spears die hard fan or collector\\"
B000A59PMO|5.0|I absolutly adore this show! I was wandering around my local video store when I found a used boxset.I figured it was only [...] bucks and i didnt have anything else to do.So i bought it,took it home and popped it in the dvd player.I was almost at once,hooked.Veronica,(Kristin Bell) has a great,semi-sarcastic sense of humor but she also has morals.The cast was brought together impeccibly and the show gave exactly what i was looking for.I enjoyed season one so much, i bought the second and third season right away.I was slightly disappointed at the end of season three however because it left me hanging,waiting for something else to happen.My over all opinion is that this is a very witty show with a great cast and great stories!
0517548232|5.0|This book is by no means the only book you should read on economics, merely reading this one book does not give you a good enough grounding.  There is very little (none at all, IIRC) in the way of empirical data, for example, all of the lessons are in the form of \\"worker A produces product Z,\\" that type of thing.  Which is very useful for teaching concepts and relations.  This book is masterful at getting you to *think* like an economist, which many people can't do (even some economists) just from reading a book on economics.  By stripping each lesson to its bare, abstract essentials, you can't help but see the underlying principles at work once you finish this book.  What you learn here you will use while reading other econ texts, and in your own observations of the world around you.    This is a landmark primer and my only real problem is that the author is defiantly Austrian school and when he tackles Friedmanesque monetary policy I don't think he gets it right--like many other econ writers he seems to be attacking a second-hand version of Friedman, and not Friedman's actual teachings.  I could be wrong, perhaps he wasn't trying to tackle Friedman, that's a drawback of his abstract approach.    By all means read this book.
0375413405|5.0|After watching the recent movie about Julie Child, I felt compelled to get this book.  It is not exactly a quick recipe guide, in fact the recipes are rather involved and challenging.  I am enjoying the few items I have made from the book and hope you do to.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie shows science fiction at its best, without the need of excessive action or elaborate special effects but delivering a powerful message that lets you wondering about humanity's prejudice, xenophobia, social segregation and greed, and what a genial choice to set the story in modern South Africa.<br /><br />As originality has become scarce in several art fields, District 9 shines as a beacon of creativity, and undoubtedly will join the pedestal with other giant works of sci-fi such as [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]] and [[ASIN:B000TZ19TC Fahrenheit 451]]. What these best of the best sci-fi works have in common is that they convey a strong critic of our society while entertaining, and their main accomplishment is that they are welcomed by all audiences, so you do not have to be a sci-fi fan or a nerd to enjoy it. Another distinct feature of District 9 is that the story is not based nor inspired by an existing novel, but on a 2005 short film created by Director Blomkamp himself.<br /><br />Mr. Sharlto Copley (Wikus) performance is outstanding, and the film unfolds so unexpected that it is very difficult to guess what is coming next or how it is going to end. Be aware though that similarly to the [[ASIN:B000087F6L Fahrenheit 451]] movie, the beginning is a bit slow and even confusing due to Mr. Blomkamp's love for documentary-style filming, but bear patiently the first 30 minutes, the movie changes the rythm and you are not going to regret it. I have not watched such an excellent movie for a long time, and this probably one of the best movies of the 2000s.<br /><br />I bought the film on Blu-ray Disk (BD) format but actually the fast action is limited to the last third of the movie, so it will not make that much difference if you buy it on the cheaper DVD format. However, I love the extra goodies included in the BD package (I got the film at a brick and mortar store, Amazon's description does not say anything about these extras), particularly the free digital copy that you can download and can watch in your PC or your iPOD. Also included was a [[ASIN:B002I0J4VQ PlayStation 3 120 GB]] playable game demo. Look for the packages specially marked with this promotion (it seems this is a limited time promotion with most recently released BDs).<br /><br />As the doors were left open for a sequel; let's hope Mr. Blomkamp's creativity and quality content are kept at the same level, quite a daunting task in the movie industry where money talks louder than art. Despite their completely opposite approaches, District 9 and [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]] surely are the two best sci-fi films of the abundant 2009 crop.<br /><br />PS: for another 2009 sci-fi gem that might become a classic do not miss [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]]al copy that you can download and can watch in your PC or your iPOD.

076532413X|5.0|I am so glad I found this ten year-old from Sawyer while scouting in a bookstore for an interesting SF novel, and completely unaware of the 2009 ABC TV series inspired on this novel. Nowadays it is getting difficult to read a good science fiction novel, and particularly one from the hard Sci-fi genre.<br /><br />As CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) went on-line last year and finally made the first collisions in November 2009, this SF story is quite timely regarding the potential unintended consequences of the high energy experiments that will be conducted, and also because the plot is set in the the then futuristic 2009!<br /><br />Due to a discontinuity in the space-time continuum presumably caused by the LHC (no spoiler) the entire world's population travel for a few minutes to the future (the \\"flashforward\\"), and Sawyer exploits quite well the possibilities with a clever plot, accompanied by discussions regarding quantum mechanics and astrophysics, a delight for fans of hard science fiction, and yes cardboard characters, but for lovers of the hard stuff, plot and scientific extrapolation is what really matters, and Sawyer delivers quite well. The nerdy stuff is accompanied by quite interesting philosophic discussions about free will versus predetermined future.<br /><br />Definitively a must read for the hard Sci-Fi tribe, and if you like it, do not miss [[ASIN:0765322897 Calculating God]], another good novel by Sawyer that also has the right balance between science and social/philosophical message.<br /><br />PS: The TV Series is based on this novel only regarding the \\"flashforward\\" event, everything else is unrelated to the original plot. So, if you like sci-fi and enjoyed the TV series do not miss reading the real thing.

0446402397|4.0|This story of a Soviet-era serial killer is riveting - a nail-biter from start to finish.    But, I found myself extremely annoyed by the author's/editor's lack of quotation marks for dialogue, using italics instead. That made for difficult reading (visually), and I had to keep reminding myself that these were not thoughts in the characters' heads, but actual dialogue. Stick to the standard punctuation, please!
0061122416|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book about a young lad looking for treasure and striving to be better than what he currently is. Although he has to give up living in his comfort zone, setting out to pursue his goals makes him a stronger person. Although the book's title ostensibly focuses on the alchemist character, the book really is about the personal journey of the boy and, by obvious extension, our own lives.    The book's short length allows its many clear messages to shine through. Don't give up on your dreams. The reward is in the journey, not the end goal. Even if you're stuck in a bad situation, go at it with a sense of enthusiasm, purpose, and accomplishment. We're often timid, but the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. If love keeps you from getting to the treasure, then it's not true love. Attaining the Personal Legend makes people better than they were in their previous life, and everything around them becomes better too. Finally, my personal favourite: don't just look for the gold, because even if you've attained it, you might not have found the secret and message that was meant to be learned.    Highly recommended.
0385504225|4.0|Sure, this book wasn't as good as The DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons, but it was still a good read.  It kept me intrigued throughout and the short chapters made for easy reading.  I will admit the last few chapters seemed to drag on a bit.  Once the big 'twist' occurred, which I didn't see coming, and the villain was out of the picture, the book kind of slowed down and started to get quite repetitive.  I just wanted it to be over already!  Overall, I would recommend this book.
B00000JG41|5.0|Over the years, I have been very back and forth regarding the vocal stylings of Mike Patton. Sometimes I marvel at his incredible vocal facility, other times I feel he is too cartoonish.   All that aside, I just dusted off my copy of \\"California\\" yesterday. Now that my ears have matured quite a bit more, I can really appreciate the contents of this album.  First of all, it's really heavily orchestrated. There are so many little tiny details in the many layers of music for each of these tracks; you have to listen several times to catch what each instrument is on each track. Heavy use of orchestral instruments, mixed with electronics, makes for a very modern, yet sort of old-fashioned sound.  More important is the song writing itself. Whereas this whole album is amazing, I'll single out just a few songs.  \\"Retrovertigo\\" is bar none my favorite song on the whole album. What I find clever is that there is a melodic line in the verse of the song that keeps returning in different sections of the song, in different instruments. It appears in whole, and in fragments. To me, that shows that this is a very well thought out composition. Also to note is that the song is just absolutely gorgeous; it's almost a tear jerker, but then it seems to turn into a power ballad at the end. Very beautiful writing.  Another song to note is \\"Vanity Fair\\". This is what I would call an electro-doo wop. The \\"doo wopping\\" is electronically altered; the voices sound machine-like. What's more, this song is also very heavily layered. It sounds like there are up to about 10 Mike Patton's singing on this song; it's as if he is the Beach Boys. Also, the music is just killer. It captures that surf ballad feeling, but almost a bit of 50's soul, and more modern, electronic music. Once again, very brilliant song writing!    i don't know if this review will help. But believe me when I say that is definitely Mr. Bungle's best album, and possibly Mike Patton's finest hour, at least in my book. This album isthe fruit of a very complex, inventive, and resourceful mind. Bravo.
B0029O08WA|3.0|I must admit, I didn't care for the music in \\"New Moon\\" as much as \\"Twilight.\\" This probably has to do with the fact that most of the tracks on this album are more melancholy, and even a bit dismal. I'm not saying that the music is bad...in fact, the worst song featured in these movies so far was in \\"Twilight.\\" (\\"TONIGHT....BLINDING LIGHT! LET'S GOOOOOO....INTO TWILIGHT!!!\\") My favorite tracks on the \\"New Moon\\" CD include \\"A White Demon Love Song\\" by The Killers, \\"No Sound but the Wind\\" by Editors, and the final track on the album, the instrumental piano ballad \\"The Meadow.\\" Overall, this is good music, but just not as intense and exciting as the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack.

0786838655|3.0|Let me say I'm well out of the target demographic; I just picked this up after seeing the trailers for the movie.  So, if you're in the target, maybe take my words with a grain of salt.    I like the premise a lot.  Children of gods in a modern world.  It's fresh, it sets the stage for a lot of interesting possibilities.  I really wanted to love it.  However, the plot is thin and shallow, and the narration I feel is weak.    - The narration tries to be colloquial.  It doesn't come naturally, it feels awkward.    - There's a fair bit of deus ex machina    - The hero does what I have always hated, ever since I was a little kid; make the same mistake over and over again, largely in the form of trusting people.    - Each character's motivations are absolutely transparent.  Even the plot twists can be seen coming from a mile away.    - Dude. You control the ocean. Be more creative, use it more often!  <= (pet peeve when somebody has a really cool ability with lots of potential)    It was fun for the 2 nights' read it lasted, but not much more than that.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|The Incident is another excellent album by one of the best bands in the world right now. I highly anticipated it and I was not disappointed. Steve Wilson and his crew take us on quite an amazing musical journey which showcases probably every single aspect and style of Porcupine Tree's amazing musical ability. This is an album that is impossible to listen to without listening to it all the way through. You can't really skip to a song you like since it's one complete work (aside from disc 2). If you like Porcupine Tree, pick this up, set aside about an hour of time for yourself and zone out to some amazing music. Highly recommended!
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is best known for making deep and complex alternative rock anthems, which makes this album a bit of a shock. They've gone as musically conservative as they can-- digging themselves inside the trench of modern rock and roll, putting on a helmet, and then firing like mad. If you're expecting 'U2 being U2', or- that is- expecting U2 to be creative, daring, and innovating like in past decades, then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />But none of this, as most musical critics seem to think, really makes this a 'bad' album. On the contrary, I would highly recommend it to pretty much anyone. This is 'every song is a potential single' music that will never get any real respect, but it should. The band has given a certain section of their fans what they really wanted: A classic rock and roll album. And they did a fantastic job with that mission in mind.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Enjoyed Susan Boyle's /cd....I Dreamed a Dream.  Beautiful voice...good recording quality.  Well worth the $$$.
B000002GGU|5.0|Steven Thomas Erlewine of [...] has stated that \\"Bryan Adams negotiated the shifting tides of the '80s so well that it never seemed as if he were changing to fit the times.\\" That seems like an understatement of the worst kind, and this album proves it.<br /><br />Adams has distilled all kinds of developments of the 1980s music since and filtered it into his classic brand of 1970s AOR/hard-rock. The result is a set of superb rock and roll songs that encapsulates the decade's trend while he also puts his own trademark spin on everything.<br /><br />The anthemic hard rock hit \\"Summer of '69\\" has become Adams' signature song, and it's worth it. \\"One Night Love Affair\\", \\"Long Gone\\", \\"Somebody\\", and \\"Ain't Gonna Cry\\" are very close in terms of spirit and sound-- although they're far from being derivative and are certainly worth listening to over and over again. \\"She's Only Happy When She's Dancin'\\" is a pop rock gem that is unfairly overlooked. It reminds you well of all the nice yet forgettable dance-pop tunes of the early 1980s. \\"Kids Wanna Rock\\" gives the same vibe. \\"Run to You\\" is simply haunting and it's my favorite track. \\"Heaven\\" is a typical 80s power ballad that is, in my opinion, the weakest tune of the whole set. Although, I'm sure it will have many listener's wanting to break out the lighters. And \\"It's Only Love\\" is one of the best duets in modern rock history.<br /><br />So, seriously, what are you waiting for? I'm completely recommended the entire album, with every song, to anyone.
B00049QNMG|5.0|While this was NOT a true DVD audio release, it was excellent anyway.
0545123267|5.0|I did not think I would like this book.  I put off buying it for weeks--I ended up sort-of being forced to buy it at a convention, to have it signed by the author.  I'm a teacher and I like having autographed copies for my students (it encourages reading).  I originally found it on the 'Employees Recommend' shelf at my local giant bookstore, and it was labeled 'a must-read for Team Jacob fans'.  Now, I'm a t-shirt wearing member of Team Jacob (I'm also 30 years old, which is either funny or sad, I'm not sure which!)  However, I loved this book.  It was too good of a story to be merely compared to Twilight--it stands on its own (and dare I say I liked these characters more?) So if you are reading this review, trying to figure out 'is this just another Twilight rip-off'--it is not.  It is a beautiful story, well written and original.  Read it.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />As a side note, I just finished reading the sequel, Linger, as I had an advanced copy (from same convention above--teachers, go to conventions!) I will not review it here, as there must be some reason reviewing is disabled on amazon for books not yet published, however, know that it does not disappoint, either.  Actually, the only thing I'm truly disappointed by is the fact that I don't even think the third--and final--in the series is even written yet!
B002MRRRAA|4.0|This concert was fortunate to be preserved in time for the enjoyment of all future generations, to offer insight into the culture of an era that redefined the polished trend of music. This is a phenomenal concert.    Part of what makes this DVD great is how unrefined the final product is. Parts where the band faltered were left in instead of edited out. One instance of this is very apparent in \\"Sliver\\" where Kurt Cobain starts the song off singing off key, holds back a laugh, and continues to try to find the right note. I would have been exceedingly disappointed if this was edited out. Everything about this concert has been done in tune with the philosophy of the grunge movement in the late 80s and early 90s. Everything from the on stage stumbling dancer Tony Hodgkinson (who \\"still writes all [their] songs,\\" =) to the chanting of the crowd, singing the songs with equal vocal force against the amplifiers of the band.    Its the small things which make this show interesting. The crowd roaring the lyrics of \\"Dumb,\\" which was not even on an album yet, and Krist remarks \\"The power of the bootleg, Kurt!\\" the tongue in cheek sense of humor of Kurt Cobain being wheeled out to the microphone in a blond wig, all make this an \\"must have\\" for any Nirvana fan.    That said, this dvd does have its downside.    For one, some critics have called this \\"the greatest concert of all time,\\" and while despite being a huge Nirvana fan for years, this simply is not true. Its a great concert, but it by no means tops the performances of Woodstock and various other legendary events.    Another issue, which I actually decided not to give the 5th star for, was the lack of interviews or bonus features. I would have loved to have seen some interviews with Dave, Krist, Kurt, or even zombie dancer Tony Hodgkinson (sure, mark me down as a Hodgkinson fan now too. It takes stones to be a one man dancing troop!)    Altogether though, great show, great set-list, and an amazing era in music, which stillcontinues to have a solid impact on music being written over 17 years later. This is going to be a dvd you'll kick yourself 20 years from now if you don't get your hands on a copy.

I saw these when i ordered an additional controller and thought I would give them a try.  I cannot say enough good about what they have done for me.  The positioning of the fingers is made much easier and allows a novice like myself a much easier time when in the heat of the battle so to say.      Also the installation was very easy and when installed they are very secure, contrary to what other reviewers have said.  Buy them, they a well well worth the minimal investment!!!
0385341008|4.0|This book is fetchingly good. Just the right length for a good book club selection which is what we did; kicked off the DFW literary Society inaugral read with this little letter-writing ditty from Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows and its a good thing we did as it proved to be an engaging, thought-provoking and discussion-inducing read.<br /><br />Since overviews of the subject matter of books are kind of expected in reviews, I'll indulge you. Think World War II literary London, occupied channel islands, wartime and its aftermath, post-war putting lives back together, and a unique perspective of war told with particular insight into making individual characters live and breathe uniquely from one another but connected in the good and bad of human drama and there you have it: \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.\\" The book, despite telling some inhuman details of wartime occupation on the island of Guernsey, avoids the general nastiness of war. We feel exposed to some of the cruel things that went on but not mucked and mired down in the grime of the reality of war and its conduct and combat. It is much more the \\"Life is Beautiful\\" retelling of World War II with an English proper manner twist then the \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" bullets and death variety. You feel uplifted when all is said and done of strong characters overcoming the unnaturalness and brutality of an all-consuming wartime world.<br /><br />The tale is told in epistolary form, which is really just a fancy way of saying the authors wrote the book in the form of letters. Instead of this being a unique literary gimmick it totally works and never gets in the way of the story.

B000EYK4KI|4.0|MR. & MRS. SMITH is slick and loud and a bit empty and maybe even obnoxious, but since it features perhaps the most beautiful couple in the world, I tend to overlook the movie's excesses and transgressions. You just about have to, with films like this which run on sheer glamorous star power and make you cave with its oodles of sex appeal.<br /><br />The movie starts off cute, borrowing a morsel from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, that bit where married couples are being interviewed. Immediately we catch on that, after five or six years of gradually eroding togetherness, the Smiths' marriage has stagnated. John Smith is a professional engineer. Jane Smith troubleshoots iffy corporate computer servers. They know this about each other. But what each doesn't know is that the other is secretly an elite contract assassin. And their hidden worlds are about to collide.<br /><br />Essentially MR. & MRS. SMITH is a screwball from the hitman's perspective and it's marked with such a heightened sense of fun and cool and style that I half anticipated cameos from Pitt's Ocean's Eleven cronies. It's more lighthearted than [[ASIN:B00009Y3PV Prizzi's Honor]] and not as dark as [[ASIN:B0009X75PQ The War of the Roses]]. The action pieces are super-charged and over-the-top; the undercover assassin elements are handled well. Is the movie as gritty as, say, the Bourne flicks? No, but it's obvious that this movie isn't going for that grittiness. It's half a dose of provocative marriage-on-the-rocks romance, and half John Woo-inspired bullets ballet.<br /><br />- Jane Smith to her husband John: \\"Baby, you couldn't find the button with two hands and a map.\\"<br /><br />MR. & MRS. SMITH frames Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt at their banterful best, their caustic, suggestive exchanges perhaps giving us a whiff of what really went on behind the scenes on set (if you buy all those rumors). Jolie and Pitt are Hollywood royalty, and this film capitalizes on their star power and showcases their spectacular chemistry. And it's hard not to get the vapors, watching their sensual dance in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia or that home-wrecking domestic brawl they get into. This film isn't as good as [[ASIN:B00026ZG10 True Lies]] but it's way sexier (and this is with mad respect to Jamie Lee Curtis's hotel room strip scene).<br /><br />And sometimes the curse of being too beautiful kicks in. Pitt and Jolie are so gorgeous that we sometimes forget that these two have got very good acting skills. They're so natural and charismatic at playing these types of roles that one tends to dismiss the work that goes into the portrayal. These guys can act. Props, also, to the scoring. The droll, easy-breezy score is indispensable, transforming what would otherwise have been an unbearable study of a stifling marriage into something that comes across more as a series of comedic domestic squabbles.<br /><br />But, yes, okay, it does feel at times as if the film is trying too hard. There's a bit of overkill.<br /><br />But, dang, look at all the pretty.<br /><br />This Unrated edition comes in two discs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and Director Doug Liman's film commentary. Disc 2 has the following:<br /><br />- \\"Confidential Files\\" features 12 deleted scenes - including Adam Brody's funny extraction scene and a pretty neat (but predictable) alternate ending - and the screenplay of yet another alternate ending, and almost four minutes of gag reel.<br /><br />- \\"Domestic Violence: Shooting MR. & MRS. SMITH\\" - the 33-minute Behind-the-Scenes documentary (a worthwhile look, and I liked the break down footage of several scenes, including the two dance pieces).<br /><br />- \\"Doug's Film School\\" - Director Doug Liman introduces seven segments: \\"Framing Device\\" tracks Adam Brody's providing narration as a framing device for the story (although the studio eventually decided not to go this route). \\"Mother & Father\\" is a series of deleted cutaway scenes featuring John and Jane's respective bosses (Jacqueline Bisset and Terrence Stamp, later replaced with Angela Bassett and Keith David). The lengthy \\"Snowy Ravine\\" segment features the previsualization and live shooting of the ravine sequence (where you can see Brad Pitt get in a firefight with a cartoon); the ravine sequence later became the desert sequence, the shooting of which is also included (plus the screenplays for both sequences). We see the animated storyboarding Liman used to prep for the \\"Hood Jump\\" sequence (where Jane runs over John with her car); screenplay included. \\"Underground Garage\\" presents an alternate take of the Smiths' \\"run or fight\\" conversation which, in the movie, took place under a sewer grate but in this bonus scene is set in an underground garage; screenplay included. \\"HomeMade\\" focuses on the alternate front-end sequence to the big firefight climax (taking place this time in the HomeMade depot center during business hours instead of KostMart at night); also included, two storyboard sequences and the screenplay. Finally, there are \\"Previsualizations\\" (rough conceptual animation) of seven scenes.<br /><br />- and three photo galleries.eline Bisset and Terrence Stamp, later replaced with Angela Bassett and Keith David).

B0026P3G12|5.0|It was all I could hope for. A great mix of songs with  that unforgetable voice. The song selection is for  the more mature but then we are her audience. The  last song is Silent Night. It's my favorite X'mas  song. I have no idea how many times I have heard it  and by how many singers. It was some rendition.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|I immediatly rolled my eyes when my roommate came back from Blockbuster with this as one of his movies.   \\"You rented me a remake!?\\"   \\"Trust me, its not\\".   \\"You know how much I like Roger Corman films, especially Death Race 2000\\". I told him.   \\"You'll see\\".    I was prepared to see another classic film utterly destroyed by the remake-hatchet, and to my suprise, I was wrong.    In short,its an enjoyable adventure romp with some good and some bad things of the movie.    1)PLOT - Laid-off steelworker gets framed for killing his wife. Kinda cliche since that kind of plot has been used numerous times since 'The Fugitive'.   Still, it works for the reason later on. 85% Rating.    2)VEHICLES - I'm a Twisted Metal fan(not of 3rd and 4th installment), and the way the cars(and truck) were designed reminiced of this game series. Very nicely done, especially the killer rig. Awesome! 100% Rating.    3)CHARACTERS - Didn't need the \\"showgirls\\" theme with the navigators leaving the bus. Tasteless.   The loud-mouth from '2Fast&2Furious' as Machine Gun Joe. Interesting choice.  'Frank' was nothing more than a mask. Okay I guess, but rather lame here as well.   The warden I feel redeemed things here. A look of an angel with a devil hidden inside. Excellent character from beginning to end. 40% Rating.      4)ACTION - The fight scene in the cafeteria reeked of 'Shawshank Redemption'.  The vehicular action overall was great, aside from the maneuver of driving backwards ala '2Fast2Furious'. That was lame.  75% Rating.      OVERALL -   I know most(if not all) see this film as a remake of 'Death Race 2000'. To me,its not. This film seemed inspired by the Roger Corman film. There is a lot of things that seperate it from that film. Character background. An actual plot - Blackmail, backstabbing, revenge, and some drama mixed in nicely.     However, I don't see this film ever becoming a classic. Only as an enjoyable action film. Its definatly not a perfect film. There are some things that could be removed, but everyone's tastes vary. Me, I watch it for the vechicular mayhem, and the destruction they leave in their wake. I could care less about the eye-candy. Things blowing up and getting wrecked. YES!    So in closing, 'Death Race' is not a remake to me. Just a great action film with lots of explosions, and a plot added to the mix.
B000GT4H0Y|2.0|I brought this movie at a 99 cent store because i confused it with Aeon Flux.<br />Despite all the blood gore and killing i found this movie to be very boring.
B001W79MBI|5.0|This story is set in the time when China dominated Japan.  The Chinese emperor has his astronomer find a boy whose blood will be used to make an elixir which will make him immortal.  The boy and his dog escape from a monastery.  In his travels to another monastery, he meets a wandering, red-headed warrior, whom he hires to protect him on his journey.   The warrior has his own secrets and mysterious past.  He and the boy's dog prove to be the boy's greatest allies and defenders.    The Chinese emperor has hired a mysterious blond warrior who is only looking for a good fight.  I wondered if there was a connection between the two outsiders.     I bought this dvd because of the reviews on Amazon.  It lived up to  its reviews.  I wonder if this was pilot for a show or intended to stand alone.  It can go either way.  It is a fast-paced story with lots a sword fighting, and just a bit of humor.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|A decent book that has an undeserving reputation.<br /><br />The story is interesting and the style is intricate and engaging. As a thriller it manages to create an urgent atmosphere that keeps the reader hanging. However, the final resolution is lacking in drama and left me somewhat unsatisfied. Moreover, counter to what many critics suggest, the heroine is unconvincing and difficult to sympathize with.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This compilation covers over 20 tracks The Cranberries' career from their first album \\"Everybody's Doing It\\" from 1993 and through the subsequent four albums till their hiatus around 2003. The collection focuses on the group's singles, all of which, together are included along with one selected number from their arguably most acclaimed album, \\"No Need to argue\\" and two previously unreleased tracks.<br /><br />Personally, I find the group most interesting when their Irish folk-roots shines through most clearly . Actually I once saw them almost as a folk-rock band, because I only knew \\"No Need to argue\\". This is obviously not adequate for the group, which actually spans a very broadly from indie rock through folk till pop.<br /><br />For a best of release, it is by no means an easy-listening album. Some numbers may well appear a little odd for single choices, while others such as \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Just My Imagination\\" and \\"Stars\\" seems tailor-made to the charts - all three among my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Zombie\\" has probably become the group's signature tune, but there are others which deserve a comment. \\"Ode To My Family\\", is one of the finest recordings group has released.<br /><br />This release must be conmplimented for a long time (78 min.) On the other hand it is extremely sparse with details. There is practically no mention of anything apart from the twenty songtitles. Not even songwriting credits are listed - if my version is a special environmentally friendly version, I know not, but it is mentioned on the cover that is made of \\"Renewable, Recycleable, Biodegradeable\\" material.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|After reading lot of reviews on this cooler, I was apprehensive about mounting it. But it was very easy. Yes the instructions are terrible!  But, if you are afraid of messing it up just go to youtube you will find mounting video.  The cooling is really good and it is a cheap cooler.  The only complaint might be the noise, which is not a prime issue but I wanted a very quite system. You can always tuned down the fan speed if your motherboard allows it.    At the end you will enjoy this product.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all.  It took a very long time for it to develop and I lost interest in it before I finished watch it. I couldn't sit down and endure it till it finished, so I really don't know how it ended.  The documentary type format was a bad idea.  It didn't feel like I was watching a movie, it felt like I was watching a crappy documentary.  The aliens were just big, ugly savages.  I love alien movies!  But this one really disappointed me.
0385504225|3.0|Let me preface my remarks by saying that I admire Dan Brown's ability to write these thrilling Robert Langdon tales.  With few exceptions I find his books hard to put down (Deception Point - not so much).      But my beef with this book is that I feel like it's the same story (or formula for a story) as many of his other books.  It's the same habit that has turned me off of John Grisham's books. The story takes place over a day or two. Robert Langdon is enjoying some weekend time and then suddenly he finds himself in the middle of a quest that turns into a chase. There's a girl. She's smart and pretty.  There are powerful friends. There's a conspiracy. Langdon saves the day at the end.    Don't get me wrong - I like this book, but I don't know how many more books *just like the Da Vinci Code* that I will be willing to continue to buy.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This video is great for cardio.  The use of weights simply adds to the heartrate increasing.. and yeah, here and there, one can feel tired muscles, but this will not really build any muscle that is not there.  If you have great muscle tone but are carrying extra weight and need to strip off some fat so that muscle shows, this will absolutely help. If you have poor muscle tone and need to really work the muscles to get them to show, then this is not for you.  Jillian makes a statement in level 2 \\"These 'lat rows' will really give you that V look in the back\\".  Well, as a former personal trainer, competitive bodybuilder and powerlifter, I must say, \\"THAT IS A LINE OF CRAP\\".  Light weight lat rows will NOT create a V in the back.  Heavy weighted lat pull downs will do that..    Also, she talks too much while the others do the work.... too much \\"if you want to do a 20 minute work out then you need to.....\\" and she just keeps saying it... not motivating, just annoying.      The girls in her video did NOT sculpt their bodies from this workout, no matter what she tries to tell you.      Jillian's ab portion of this is a joke.  I do my own instead and am dying in that 1 minute ab portion.. hers are just a waste of time.  Also, some of her moves are bad for knees and back...... if you have any disk problems, beware of the \\"plank\\" moves = just throw something else in there.    Also, she says that biceps must be worked with legs to get the max calorie burn.  Bull crap.  If you work biceps right, you can get ur heart rate up higher than her entire video can... its called HIIT method and its a killer... but it can be done....     She makes too many bogus statements for my liking... so muting it is the best option.      this is very good for beginners or for people who want a quick supplement when they're really busy and can't get to teh gym...but it will not shred anyone.
0743289692|5.0|Wonderful experience of a struggle of freedom from a woman that should be named a hero.  Written well and with passion and strength that is a symbol of what a hero is all about.  I recommend this to everyone and especially to women to learn about the things we take   for granted.    Do not order through the smeilkalbooks as the size and text is smaller.
0385504225|3.0|Well, this is Dan Brown, right? You're not going to get deep psychological insights or rich characters. But it does give you a thrilling ride. This novel actually starts slowly, far too slowly for me, and then picks up pace and leaves you at the end of every chapter dying for more. However, the details about the Masonic links to the US and Washington's geography get tiring and pedantic. And the great insight about the power of human thought is a bit of a let down. Having just read 'While the Gods Sleep' by J Fincham and before that, 'A day in the life of Ivan Denosivich,'by the Russian author, A Solzhenitsyn, the first of these an SF novel about the power of human thought and the second a book with incredible characterization, I felt this book was a bit of a let down by comparrison.
B0000026ND|3.0|Now I love this album and for nostalgic purposes I bought the cassete on here. I only got the first cassete. There is supposed to be 2 cassetes! Anyway, I only payed 50 cents for it so I don't feel too bad but now I won't be able to hear Time, Another Brick in the Wall or Comfortably Numb! Anyway, if you plan on buying this on cassete, pay a little more and make sure in the description they say \\"2 Cassetes\\".
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I don't watch a lot of television other than news, but my wife and I sat through the premiere episode of Fringe back when it originally aired on FOX for the first time and I've been hooked ever since. Having not missed an episode and currently being half way through season two, I can tell you this show is amazing. This is really the thinking-man's show. Not only does it have wonderfully captivating characters and plot, but they really delve deep into all sorts of theoretical \\"fringe\\" science ideas which is a lot of fun! They do a great job of making this technically 'sci-fi' seem like it might actually be feasible in today's world. This is certainly my favorite show out there and I was thrilled to get [[ASIN:B001C4CI8U Fringe: The Complete First Season]] as a Christmas gift. I have already been re-watching all the episodes and catching all kinds of things that I missed before. The shows are packed full of hidden references to future revelations, fascinating 'Easter eggs' to spot, and even the glyphs with the small yellow orb that are displayed before each commercial break contain a secret code that spell out a word relevant to the episode. (Do an internet search for \\"fringe glyph code\\" to find the key to decrypt the words yourself.) This show isn't for the casual watcher to catch an occasional episode every now and then, but if you want to really get into a good show, then Fringe is for you, too.
B000002LCK|5.0|I was fifteen when the original compilation (then on cassette tape) came out. I purchased the double CD years later. As I begin to get older, I'm pleasantly surprised that New Order's music ages well -- it doesn't sound dated. That being said, newbies wishing to hear N.O.'s music, or collectors wanting to purchase their early hits, can find a wonderful collection here.    \\"Substance\\" contains originals and \\"older\\" remixes of their greatest hits. On other newer collections, you'll get different remixed interpretations of their greatest hits -- which, in my opinion as a N.O. fan, is well worth the price.    Throughout \\"Substance,\\" it's interesting to listen to Bernard Sumner's evolution as a lead singer/artist. First, his style mimicked the style of Ian Curtis, the former lead singer of Joy Division (N.O.'s former moniker. Sadly, Curtis committed suicide, and Sumner took his place). Sumner eventually emerged from Curtis' style and shadow, and developed into his own as an artist. Their courage -- moving on and thriving in spite of tragedy -- has been an example to me, as an artist and a person.    New Order's songs always have a sense of urgency, angst, sadness -- but joy in spite of it all. Their lyrics are even more meaningful now than ever before to me as I grow older. Some of my favorites on here are \\"Perfect Kiss,\\" \\"Shellshock,\\" \\"Bizarre Love Triangle,\\" \\"True Faith,\\" and \\"1963,\\" but all of the songs are great ones. I never get tired of listening to them.    I'm so glad that they're still producing music to this day.
B002VECM40|5.0|Based on the novel, \\"Push\\", this is the story of an overweight, illiterate and pregnant teenager named Precious who is already the mother of one child who has Down's syndrome.  Gabourney Sidibe plays the title role and her performance is nothing less than extraordinary.  From the moment the film started, I entered her world, a ghetto world of searing poverty and constant verbal abuse from her mother played by Mo'nique.  Their scenes together made me shudder and it was hard to imagine that Precious would ever get out from under the horror of her life.<br /><br />And then Precious goes to an alternative school, where her teacher, played by Paula Paton, gives her some hope.  There's also a sympathetic social worker played by Mariah Carey.  But most of all it is Precious' own strong will and determination that eventually changes her attitude towards life.  There's a positive message in this film and I left the theater smiling although I couldn't keep my eyes from filling with tears.<br /><br />Hooray for this film!  It's unique, upsetting and both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.  It's no wonder the critics are raving.
B0002X314C|3.0|...but.. it reminds me of a movie soundtrack of a cheater's life. I had this album on repeat, because I genuinely like the arrangements and Legend's singing -- but the more I listened to the lyrics -- the more I wanted to stop listening to the album. Sometimes, you'll get the urge to smack Legend, though he's only \\"playing\\" a part while singing the song. Hey, his album still on my IPOD..    ...but, maybe it's a woman thing, no sista wants to think their man is out cheating on them when they're in a relationship. Every time I hear this album, it just has excuses and fake attempts to change. The album starts off with dissatisfaction with relationships/the motivation to cheat \\"Used to Love You,\\" to the actual act of cheating during \\"She Don't Have to Know,\\" and finally, begging the girl to stay with \\"I Can Change.\\" \\"Ordinary People\\" is the acceptance that people in relationships are faulty, imperfect and human, and working toward repairing past transgressions. Theme-wise, the songs work....and Legend sounds great singing them, and I liked the album...    ...but...hey...beautiful though it may be, it's still the same playa crap just dressed up to make it more palatable.
B00164KYV4|3.0|This silly chick flick was on my cable TV channel and there was nothing else to watch.  Simply put, the title, which is the name of a self-help book, says it all.  This is a pleasant film that is not supposed to be great.  It's just a simple story with a star studded cast and a plot that includes several romances.  Acting is good, the story moves fast and it's a pleasure to see such stars as Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck, Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Connoly and Ginnifer Goodwin (of \\"Big Love\\") going through the ups and downs of trying to find love.<br /><br />There is nothing special about this film.  It is as predictable as I expected it to be.  But sometimes it's not a bad thing to just relax and let myself be amused, especially if its on TV and it didn't cost me anything.  I therefore give it a very lukewarm recommendation.
B00005R23S|5.0|Just finished watching the NYC concert. First I've heard or seen of Springsteen save for a two minute clip in History of Rock 'N  Roll which I finished watching a few days ago. He was much younger then; the commentator remarking that he often performed for hours beyond any commitment,  until reaching a state of complete exhaustion. That appeared to be the case in what was shown there. At the time of this show, he was just short of fifty and I find it difficult to understand how he managed the 90 or so minutes on the disc (there is a second disc with a bountiful offering of additional songs). I am curious as to how he has held up, now at 60, and will buy a DVD  just to see.<br />As to whether this is something for you to watch, I couldn't possibly say,  not knowing your tastes. However, if you have any liking for Rock and Roll or if you only want to see a sample of what one of the best sounds and looks like, this is definitely something for you to see. Others have described in reviews what goes on. Most do it as familiars to the genre and to Mr. Springsteen. As one who is not familiar with either, I can only say that I was bowled over by his talent, his accompaniment, and by his ability to manage the stage and the audience. He is, indeed, impressive.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|....I wish Paul were secure enough in his talent and ability to just put out a live performance 'as is', without all the doctoring up in the studio.  And for those of you who actually believe what you see (DVD) is what you hear, I am sorry to disappoint you.  It's called \\"post production\\" - after the fact - and it's to clean up any little messes or flubs; those very things that make us remember that we are human and not perfect.  I hear \\"auto-tune\\" (the most over-used piece of studio equipment in the biz nowadays) all over the place, and most of the backing vocals have either been totally re-done or double-tracked.  It's hard to tell how much of Paul's lead vocals have been re-sung...I'd guess about 70%.  The giveaway is watching him while he's singing.  If he moves off-mic and the volume doesn't change, that's the giveaway.  And who is playing bass on \\"The End\\"?  Probably somebody backstage....but they should have at least been able to step out & be seen.  It wasn't Wicks (who can play any instrument) - he was on keys.  I grew up with the Beatles - they changed my life.  McCartney at 67 still kicks the asses of people half his age!  But I want to hear the real thing, bad notes, clams, and all.  All that being said, I still was going for the handkerchief at the show's end.  This is a very entertaining and extraordinary moment in musical history.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Once upon a time there was a band called Metallica... and man, they really had it. Their music was poetry. It was beautiful in every way imaginable. It had a soul. It had a voice. It had a passion. But sadly, Metallica began to fade in 1991 when they gave into the music industry. They traded their talent and their souls for millions and millions and millions of dollars. And since that time, they've never been quite the same band.<br /><br />The bands whom stayed true and did not give into the \\"hunger\\" for massive amounts of money are still making great music today. Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament... these bands were all pioneers of the 80's thrash metal scene, as was Metallica. Actually, I think Metallica was the ultimate. It's tragic.<br /><br />I think the guys realized it though in the end. With \\"St. Anger\\" they tried to go back to their roots and failed miserably. And now this, \\"Death Magnetic.\\" While \\"Death Magnetic\\" is a major improvement from anything the band has done in the last 21 years, one thing is still apparent. Metallica is still totally uninspired. You can hear their desperate attempts to return to the \\"good ol' days.\\" But it is so forced it becomes painful.<br /><br />After this release, I have to say that I am officially laying Metallica to rest. I will not buy any of the albums that they plan to release in the future. I am done with them. It is a sad day, but it was inevitable. This is what happens when MONEY becomes the main objective for playing music. Yet so many bands just don't get it.<br /><br />Metallica 1981-2008.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This version of the series on DVD is truly awesome. For the first time, the pilot episode is included, and it's so great to have the ENTIRE series in one set. The perfect gift for any true TP fan, and a great gift for anyone you want to introduce the series to.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|Like the number one reviewer for this movie stated in more words, this is a great film, with an amazing (I mean amazingly directed, acted, written, captured, portrayed) opening scene. I was speachless and blown away. Was not expecting that level of intensity. It was one of the best bits of cinema I've ever watched. The rest of the movie stays close to that, and has similiar moments and bits of dialog thats witty, intelligence, fun, refreshing, and worth watching. Sometimes the movie strays and like the other reviews say, it takes away from the beauty and perfection of an otherwise would be classic film (like braveheart, yet better).     The Myers seen was not needed. The end plot was a bit too unbelievable as Hitler and the rest of his people would not all get together in a French cinema to watch a movie, the arch villian would not turn himself over to the Americans even for a home in Nantucket. It wasnt a believable turn of his character (being the best Nazi in Hitlers army to turncoat and turn traitor at a whime). Some of the violence was ok and served its purpose, and at the right time was gratifying in the light of what the Nazi's perpetrated, other bits of useless gore were a little over the top and distracting. I did love seeing both sides as humans etc.     I loved a few of the scenes/chapters immensely though, the opening chapter, the cellar chapter, the arch villian was truly masterful, the English spy actress was very good, as was the Jewish cinema owner. I wasnt taken with Brad Pitts character or his not so believable accent.     Worth watching and owning.

This dual disc set includes the regular audio CD as well, so you can take that with you when surround isn't available.  Ironically, my least favorite song on the album is the first song, a remake of the James Taylor tune \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\", while the last tune, another remake, Christopher Cross's \\"Sailing\\" will take your breath away.  This is a wonderful album with some great guest artists both writing songs especially for George, and others playing in the recording.  George Benson fans will be thrilled to experience a whole new audio environment - bringing George Benson's recording session into your home entertainment environment.

0385504225|2.0|My wife and I spent several evenings reading this book together, and here are a few observations:    1. After reading the book, I still have no idea what it is \\"about\\".  2. If real Harvard professors are as dumb as Robert Langdon, I'm glad I went to a state school with 25,000 other morons.  3. Dan Brown is one sick puppy who wrote this book simply to see how many times (and in how many different ways) he could describe male genitalia - 'fleshy shaft', 'neutered sex organ'? ... gross.    I can't wait for the movie - it should be straight-to-DVD in your local gay adult video store by spring!
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I love this series, it's X-Files on a whole new level...truly creative thinking and masterful compilation of events in the first season....the second is just as interesting....hard to say who is my favorite character...I would definately Marry Anna no questions.... =8-)
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Average plot, average writing, average character development, average book. Not sure what the fuss is about...
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Although the kids will like the bright colors and the dog and Kevin, this talks to the adults. A touching humorous treatment of love and growing old. I liked it a lot. A couple of the kids napped toward the end.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I used to love romantic movies.  They just don't make them with substance any more.  Until this.  Its a 5 star movie to me.  It gives you that warm feeling you had when your heart did all that craziness way back when, all over again.  It will leave you smiling.
1563894696|5.0|In my review of Frank Miller's 'Batman: Year One,' I longed for more material; I complained that the work was too short. Loeb's 'Long Halloween' is a perfect fulfillment of Miller's source work. It carries forward with the characters as they are revealed in the original work, and works especially to develop the personalities of the Gotham City crime families and Harvey Dent. It also features appearnces by a whole host of classic Gotham villains. Not to be missed.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Starting with the pilot episode and going through season 2, you get a good glimpse of how the show started off without any direction as far as the characters go and watch Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer develop their nuances that made them so funny. For me, at least, this made the set both funny and interesting.
0143038419|3.0|This is really 3.5 stars. The first part of this book was almost unbearable. I found the author to be self-absorbed and whiny. Once she started traveling, reading about her experiences was interesting enough that I could overlook her personality.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|OK, First I've been listening to Transatlantic and Spocks Beard nonstop for the last 6 months.  So when I put in Whirlwind I wannted the same.  No....what is present is a newer sound that enhances the total rounded talent of these guys.  The more I play it the better I like it.  Sure hope this is not the last from Transatlantic!
B001FB55MG|4.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect with this movie, but I was immediately hooked by the charm. It's your typical good versus evil battle with a couple of twists. I rented it and cannot see myself watching it over and over, but would recommend it to anyone who needs a pick-me-up or something to watch with the kids. Courtney Cox Arquette is hilarious as Adam Sandler's uptight sister, which is made even funnier by how laid back Skeeter is.

031606792X|1.0|I am so angry with Stephanie Meyer!!!  I loved Twilight, why did she have to ruin it with this simple trashy book.  Everything just works out perfectly perfect with everyone.....that's not a good novel.  What made Bella likable were her vaults and vulnerabilities, but now she is supposedly \\"a perfect vampire\\" sitting on a terribly too high horse.  Throughout the series I tolerated everyone fawning over Bella, but this book took it to a whole new level. The worst of the novel was the creepy and annoying child......I don't even have enough time in the day to get into that...BEWARE
B001DDBCUA|2.0|I would rate this about a 1.5 stars, so I have been generous in allowing it 2 here - and that is really only for nostalgia's sake.    I found the movie watchable, but not engrossing. All the characters are simply PLASTERED in make up - which might be ok on tv, but on the big screen they look almost grotesque. In britain they have a term about people with too much orange fake tan, having been 'tangoed' - a phrase made famous by a very virulently orange coloured drink. Well these girls have been tangoed = they are overly made up orange people.    The storylines just seemed incredibly forced. Carrie is marrying Big - Big gets cold feet, rings her mobile repeatedly (which Carrie has lost) and so the first big premise of the movie is will they or won't they get married.     Marriage meanwhile is not giving Cynthia Nixon's character much fun when her husband Steve admits to having an affair, \\"it didn't mean anything\\" and thank god she just leaves him - BANG - out the door. But then after dragging our way through the whole movie, she goes to counselling. So then there is the whole will she won't she get back together with him. The link in with forgiveness between friends is extremely tenuous - however the script writers boldly make it.     Samantha just wants Me time - as everything revolves around her.     There is a trip to Mexico, a whole lot of girl talk, scatological humour but the most astonshing part is there appears to be thicker makeup slapped on the faces of these women than there is fat on their backsides. Plus there is plenty of room for endless sequels from this outing - unfortunately. The make up will only get thicker, and the story lines thinner the longer this goes on. Geriatric sex in the City anyone? The TV series was great, the movie just doesn't work - the story lines are appalling.

I absolutely love the song King and Queens!!  This band has such a unique sound and I am happy to add this to my cd collection.  The music just sweeps you away and Jared's voice is just incredible!!  This is a must have for any cd collection!!
B002VKE1K2|2.0|The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because of the actors performance.  They were believable..up until near the end when the young gal's acting took a nose dive right where she needed to be the most believable.  She really bombed out in the scene where the psychic comes back and they're at the front door.  She bottomed out there and thereafter.  Prior to that she was great.  It's like she knew how important that scene and the few next ones were to the story and somehow let her nervousness overcome her...I could totally tell she was 'over-acting' at that point.  The guy, on the other hand, was totally laughable.  His performance was good, it was his behavior that was so funny it totally removed any kind of scariness to the flick for me.  He behaves like an immature kid in a young man's body (but then again, don't all men his age act that way? LOL..just kidding).  They are adorably cute people/actors, both of them, and it would be nice to see them in better movies.<br /><br />The plot itself I'm already so familiar with because I've already dealt with living in a haunted house where doors open and close on their own and other phenomena happened.  I've done  camcording myself (not quite to the extreme as this movie though) of the paranormal phenomena that occurred and have videos of the doors doing their thing on their own, evps, photos, etc and living in that environment, for me anyway, wasn't scary.  So I really wasn't expecting this movie to be all that scary to me to begin with, and I was right, it isn't.<br /><br />The director bombed out in a couple scenes as well....he made some things too obvious.  He failed to edit out the dark round ceiling vent that blew the air onto the young gal when she was standing in the upstairs hall claiming she could feel the 'demon' breathing on her while her hair was getting softly blown around.  Another scene he blew it on was when the sheets were being moved by puffs of air, and then shortly after the actors sit down on the bed, with the guy making it a point to sit right where the sheets were moved.  That act (him sitting in that spot) didn't make the sheet movement believable, it only served to bring attention to the fakeness of it.  Also, the director *totally* blew the believability of the entire flick by the interior house setting.  Everything inside the house was too perfect.  Perfectly decorated with perfectly brand new furniture and appliances sitting in perfectly (and freshly) painted rooms.....come on..like how many average people actually live like that??  None that I know! lol<br /><br />I wouldn't even begin to compare this flick with an Alfred Hitchcock movie, that would be a total insult to Hitchcock's legacy...Hitchcock was a horror Master, the director of this flick is nowhere near that, he's not just not even in the same ballpark, he's in a totally different twilight zone.with the guy making it a point to sit right where the sheets were moved.

B0026P3G12|5.0|When I watched \\"that\\" defining audition of hers on Britain's Got Talent it blew me away and drew tears. I know the feeling of people being cynical about me or just disbelieving in me: what more her with the whole crowd baying for her blood (figuratively), pre-maturely writing her off. She seemed so out of place in this cruel, post-modern, Godless world - but did she have something else in mind then, and now.     This album is a testimony that God has not abandoned Susan Boyle. The vocals are outstanding against a deceptively simple accompaniment, especially on the star track \\"Wild Horses\\". Its so haunting yet it guts the heart verse by verse. She, is that wild horse, ain't she? I'd buy the album just for that song.     The rest of the selections are great and showcase her ability and range. She, to me, has a voice which is wide-ranging enough to do theatre/pop/ballads. What a blessing she is. Go Susan! Don't let the world get you down for you know who's on your side.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Borrowed this Celine Dion Christmas CD from a local library shortly after Thanksgiving, and was deeply touched with Celine Dion singing selections such as Oh Holy Night, These are Special Times, and Don't Save All Love for Christmas Day, Give Love each and Every Day. Was playing this CD four and five times a day before  Christmas.  Am on vacation now and left this CD home, hoping with giving it a rest and being able with hearing this wonderful music again soon.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|Alicia Keys is truly an artist, a rare musician who continues to experiment and grow with each record. On 2007's As I Am, she changed her style rather significantly, softening the edges by referencing '70s soul in place of hip-hop. She also began to sing outside of her range in a decidedly strained manner, and it actually added a refreshing dimension to her sound. The result was her most consistent album yet. On The Element of Freedom, those same strained vocals pop up again, especially on \\"Love is My Disease,\\" one of her most stirring performances. Instead of '70s soul, there is a heavy '80s pop/soft rock influence here, which works particularly well on the hit single \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" and the Prince-like \\"This Bed.\\" There are two notable collaborations. Drake offers back-up vocals on the soulful \\"Un-thinkable,\\" one of the album's strongest tracks. \\"Put it in a Love Song\\" is a duet with Beyonce, who attacks her part on an otherwise unexceptional \\"Single Ladies\\" retread. Despite a few highlights, this is a surprisingly bland effort for Alicia. Uncharacteristically banal lyrics meet with drum machines and synthesizers throughout the album, rendering most of the songs indistinguishable if not detached. As always, it's obvious Alicia and her production team put a lot of hard work into this project, which represents another stage in her creative evolution. Nonetheless, this is her first underwhelming release. 3 Stars.
B0000A118M|5.0|How do I do this? Where does a person considering himself a serious music guy and one who tries to write about his music start with Love Supreme.<br /><br />I keep thinking of Kubrick's 2001--the monkeys gathered around the monolith: they know they are seeing something massive, brilliant, never to be seen again. Something that has taken on so much meaning, any objective analysis almost becomes impossible. The monkey's were smart. They stayed a step back.<br /><br />Well, I, relunctantly, am walking right up to Love Supreme. I guess I am not that bright.<br /><br />Ok, let's start with the music. This is after all, music. Brillant music, inspired music, possibly channeled music. But it is still music. An album.<br /><br />Basically, Love Supreme is blues--mutated blues, but blues, and reletively simple blues at that. Listen to Jimmy Garrison's bass that opens the  first section, after Coltane's intro, and it is a four note blues line. Trane was a master musician, and if you want to hear his commanand of complcation, go to [[ASIN:B000002I4S Giant Steps]].<br /><br />But Love Supreme is a whole different matter, and the simplicity is part of the point. Coltrane took those blue notes, the little arpeggios that each of the four parts rest on, and absolutely nailed them down to tonics that were so basic, they packed the maximum emotion. Love Supreme in that sense may not be blues as music, but blues as emotional essense.<br /><br />What goes on top is another thing. What works so very very well here is how Coltrane takes his tenor, walks out onto the patterns he set, and blows little lines. If you notice, his playing is just a little more spare on Love Supreme--leaves a little more space. These are not, for a change, sheets of sound. They are little  gestures, little Oms. Little prayers. ba-da-ba-Da. A-LOVE-SU-PRME.<br /><br />This is what makes it all work. The minor blues, the almost casual playing Trane does. The beauty of the simplicity that makes the reverance seem natural, effortless. Perhaps never in music has such archness been so verceral--not like a heart racing, or a burn, but water running over the hands, air across the skin.<br /><br />Listen. ba-da-ba-Da. Right away, you'll get it.rchness been so verceral--not like a heart racing, or a burn, but water running over the hands, air across the skin.    Listen. ba-da-ba-Da. Right away, you'll get it.
B00164KYV4|5.0|It's interesting to me that there were so many bad reviews for this movie and that people thought it was so horrible.  It is one of the first Romantic Comedy movies in a long time that I just smiled at the end.  There was a realness for me to the stories in the movie.  I think that so often people want to deny how many (not all) men and women are wired and what they do.  I've heard stories like the ones in this movie.  In fact, although my husband and I didn't live together before we got married and we met and married in 6 months, there is a scene in the movie that reminded me of just how my husband proposed to me.  A few weeks ago he was telling me about how he'd shared our story with someone and it sounded so romantic.  But, it was a long time ago and I hadn't thought of it that way in a long time.  But, this movie reminded me of why it was romantic.  The scene in this movie was romantic.<br /><br />And I loved the ending.  A lot of people seemed to not like Gigi's character, but I've known a lot of women like her and when I was single, I know I wanted to call guys who didn't call.  I even got stood up twice by a guy once.  I genuinely thought he had just forgotten the first time.  I didn't really think he'd show up the second time.  It happens to everyone.  And I went on a lot of dates when I was single--I wasn't desperate or chasing any guys, but it does happen that you get stood up or misled.<br /><br />I think one of the greatest strengths of this movie is that most romantic movies and books make it seem as if being married and in a relationship is the answer to everything.  The ending to this movie makes it clear in a good way that it's not.  My mom always told me that it's better not to be married, than to be married to the wrong person--she didn't mean that you should just leave someone if you're unhappy, but that just wanting to get married isn't a good reason to get married--if it isn't the right person.  She also gave me another piece of advice--that when you're on your own, you can't run away from yourself--you have to face who you are.<br /><br />All that said, I did fast forward a few of the sex scenes because I just didn't want to watch them.  I just didn't enjoy watching Scarlett Johanssen's character and her storyline--I'm glad they deleted the scenes that they did.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance, it's a lot better than the title sounds.ur own, you can't run away from yourself--you have to face who you are.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|I have been a long time fan of this movie and saw it multiple times in it's original theatrical release. As far as Blue-ray goes, the Skynet edition certainly meets my expectations. The first movie (on Blue-ray) is slightly improved over the DVD release due to the age of the original source, but this version of T2 is what I expect of a high-def transfer to be. The picture of this transfer is clear with multiple versions of the film and  several special features included, this is the version to go with for a complete high-def experience. All hail James Cameron!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This film was advertised as a comedy, yet is simultaneously funny and sad. It is an up-close look at the life of two orphans in India where severe poverty is the norm. It does have a wonderful story line, which I won't give away, that holds your attention throughout.   An excellent film!
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Battle Studies opens at a high point with the U2-sounding \\"Heartbreak Warfare,\\" which features some of John Mayer's most honest lyrics. He continues his artistic growth on the unusual \\"Assassin,\\" one of the best tracks of his career. \\"War of My Life\\" and \\"Do You Know Me\\" capture him again at pleasantly unguarded moments. Unfortunately, this record doesn't stand up next to any of Mayer's previous efforts. It's full of straightforward pop and soft rock that often blends into blandness, while fans of Continuum probably expect (and prefer) a grittier, more soulful sound. A cover of \\"Crossroads\\" is more James Taylor than Eric Clapton, and \\"All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye\\" moves forward at an insufferably slow tempo. \\"Half of My Heart\\" features Taylor Swift, but she's barely noticeable; I wonder why she wasn't given a bigger part or left out of the mix entirely. Battle Studies is far from a failure, but it's also far from what I expect to hear from a talented artist like John Mayer. 3 Stars.
B00004VW0V|4.0|You have to give it to Cat Stevens: he was interested in being more than just a folkie. Don't forget Steven's was mod before he was folk, and after three pure folk albums, [[ASIN:B00004T9VT Mona Bone Jakon]], [[ASIN:B00004T9VY Tea for the Tillerman]] and [[ASIN:B00004VW0S Catch Bull at Four]].<br /><br />In the 1970s, most folkers upgraded with top sessionmen, but stuck to three minute songs. Cat actually seemed more engaged. Forigner is him taking on progressive rock.<br /><br />A suite covering the first side was something typical in 1973--if you were Yes or ELP. But Steven's widdled together songs ala Abbey Road, and hired a band of funk pros--Pretty Puride, Phil Upchurch. The arrangements are ambitoius--flutes, horns, Pretty's trademark wooshing highhat.<br /><br />But what makes \\"Forigner Suite\\" work so well is the structures it mines and lean and funky. No big solos or other histrionic accrobatics here--these suite parts sound like well written songs, and at times, approach proto-disco.<br /><br />The rest are great songs: the second half of Forigner does not have the massive sweep of the first, but the 70s craft is top notch, even if the songs are only pretty good. Still, Rolling Stone album guide does not like this album--Cat should not have been progressive, because WE don't like progressive.<br /><br />Which really means that Stevens was definately on to something.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is a great CD...something that the whole family can listen to and sing along with.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|\\"adychamp\\" wrote that this was the same transfer as the original DVD release.  It's not.  I actually took screenshots from the same exact scene\frame from each DVD, and compared them side by side.  The new B&W transfer is noticeably better.  I had a colorized version on VHS years ago that was ghastly. This new colorization is amazing. The color version comes on its own separate DVD.  It doesn't stray from the look of early color movies.  This colorization has the same color quality of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  It looks very natural for older period color films.  I imagine the Blu-ray is even better.  However, I must note that even the Blu-ray is a square picture like a standard def 4:3 television.  That's because that square-ish aspect ratio is the original aspect ratio.  Movie theater screens have had many different, distinct shapes over the past 100 years.
0345455681|2.0|Imagine digging into a lovely long chapter and being introduced to characters that are terribly interesting.  Imagine growing to care about those characters and wanting to know what would happen next in their lives.  Then imagine getting to the next chapter and finding out that it's 200 years later, the characters you fell in love with are long gone and some strangers, several generations down the line, are offered.  You sigh, you settle in to get to know these people, and find yourself finally getting to figure out what makes them tick.  You think, \\"okay, I'm ready to see what happens next for them.\\"  Then the chapter ends.  Another couple of centuries goes by, and another series of strangers is introduced.  About twenty sets of strangers, actually, over the course of this long, sprawling and ultimately frustrating series of short stories.<br /><br />Calling the book \\"London: The Novel\\" is disingenuous.  The book is a series of 21 short stories/novellas, featuring characters that happen to have similar names and a feature that is passed from one generation to the next (skipping a child here or there).  What isn't dull in the telling is simply predictable (I knew as soon as the gold coins went missing during the Roman period just what would happen to them).  A few of the chapters were nice set pieces (for instance, I rather enjoyed the intrigues of Lady De Quette), but finishing \\"London: The Novel\\" became more a test of endurance than anything else.  In my home, we referred to it as \\"The Neverending Story\\" and it wasn't a compliment.<br /><br />Perhaps I was so disappointed because it started off so well and had such promise.  For the book to fall so far over the course of 800 pages is a shame indeed.
0452295548|5.0|Terrific! Not just about her journey, but how she explains the workings of the brain. All very accessible, interesting, thought provoking.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|In May, I attended screenings at both the IMAX and the regular big screen theatre. Finally, having acquired the BLURAY release for my 8 foot home theatre screen, I've now watched this picture about a dozen times and I enjoy it more each time. I just want to go on record singing praises of gratitude to J.J. ABRAMS and company for taking the time (originally release was delayed from DEC 2008 to MAY 2009) to get this right. Now I know the purists will grouse about the slight deviations from STAR TREK lure regarding character origins and backgrounds, but all in all, this film is a great reboot of the STAR TREK universe. Every actor, from the main characters to the background bit performers, paid all due respect to the subject. So many other iconic film subjects (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, to name a few) have been played for the tongue-in-cheek laughs making fun of the material, but not this time. I was fully satisfied as a STAR TREK devotee. Many thanks to J.J. for putting together a fantastic team of actors and filmmakers. Gene Roddenberry would have been proud of this work. I hope there will be many more.

0061767581|5.0|This book sort of feels like I'm reading Lauren's pseudo autobiography, but it's so good. If you were a sucker for Laguna Beach or The Hills, this book is like the tv show, but way better. It reveals the phony side of reality TV, and it pulls you into the character. As soon as I finished the book, I googled it to see if there was sequel. Luckily it comes out in just over a month, and I will be getting it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|There is not much I can add to the other excellent reviews other than please buy this and view it with your children or others of school age. It is one of the most important documentary compilations covering the huge panorama of WWII, arguably the most significant event of the 20th century. Many of the interviews reveal valuable first hand accounts of battle, the holocaust and the day to day during the war.All the main participants are represented and not watered down or revised with political correctness which would undoubtedly be the case if this project were attempted today.War at its most horrific and victory at its finest.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I have a Cooler Master 690 case. I bought this CPU cooler to overclock my i7 920 because of its high rating. Yes, it is big and really took some time to set up. The cooling performance is great, lowering about 15~20 C compared with the stock cooler coming with CPU. The only thing I am complaining is that it is also much more noisy than the stock cooler. Overall this is a good buy. Recommended.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I received this as a christmas present a few years ago (when it was priced much cheaper!). I love this show and having the beautiful box set is wonderful. That being said, they could have provided better protection for the discs than they did and the current amazon price of $200 is WAY too much when you can watch the reruns on bravo.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I'm a big fan of the show, and the books the show is based on. I would recommend this show highly whether you've read the books or not. It's a fun and sexy show. With the plethora of vampires crowding books, movies, and television, True Blood is refreshing look at a genre that most would call cliche and overdone.<br /><br />Our heroine is Sookie Stackhouse, who is a good Southern girl from a little town called Bon Temps, Louisiana. She's a typical twenty-something girl, except for the fact that she can hear the thoughts of people around her. She tries her best to have a normal life, but when you sometimes answer people's thoughts instead of their words, people are bound to think you're crazy.<br /><br />In Sookie's world vampires are not the subject of nightmares, they have \\"come out of the coffin.\\" The official story is that they are normal people who have caught a virus that leaves them allergic to things like sunlight and garlic. They can only ingest blood, but thanks to the perfection of synthetic blood by the Japanese, vampire supposed to be able to peacefully coexist with humans. Of course, vampires don't have a virus (though some of them do have a pretty severe case of sexiness), they're really just...dead.<br /><br />During the first season, without giving anything important away, Bon Temps gets it's first vampire, and he shows a romantic interest in Sookie. Meanwhile, a serial killer begins killing in Bon Temps, and Sookie's brother is suspected to be the culprit. Sookie visits her first vampire bar, to try and clear her brother's name. It's a fast-paced show that you just can't stop watching.<br /><br />If you're interested in vampires, if you've read the books, if you're just looking for something new to watch, buy this show.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|I don't think I'd seen this film since around the time it was released about 25 years ago, first @ the theater, & then once more on VHS. I remembered it being a good film, but I'd forgotten just how good, & very powerfully emotional. I was prompted to see it again after a recent retrospective on people we'd lost this year, including film director & writer John Hughes. I don't think I can remember anyone else who made films which spoke both to & about teenagers & young people this honestly & directly.
006097625X|5.0|During these holidays friends were going to visit the Petroglyph Park in ABQ.  I remembered this book, reread for the 4th time and when done gave it to my friends, and bought another copy.  This book should be required reading for anyone in the visual arts, including those involved in websites, video, internet, gaming etc.  Saying it is a book about comics is a great disservice to the book.  It explains and dissects everything from symbols to how we read the visual and written medium.  This book has helped me in my photography work...I really think about how an image I shoot can forward and represent what I want to say.  I can't say enough positive things.  The greatest thing about this book is that it seems like Scott is in the room with you explaining extremely complex ideas in the most simplistic and fun manner. If half my textbooks in college were this fun it would have cut my education time in half.
B0002KPHXS|4.0|I just want to thank David O. Selznick for introducing the world to Ingrid Bergman, one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the big screen.  In her American debut, Bergman lights up the screen (thank god every director seems to understand that her face deserves to be framed by the camera) with her luminous presence.<br /><br />She is a goddess.<br /><br />Now, while I do consider `Intermezzo' to be a fine film, it is not without its detractors, and so I cannot call this a great movie.  The performances across the board are stellar, but the script feels a little too light for the subject matter.  We are given a healthy dose of puppydog affections, but the film skips over the most important facets of the film in order to keep a brisk running time and delve into the meatier (more heart tugging) portions of the story.<br /><br />What I mean is...<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with this film is that it doesn't really expose the heart of the relationship between Holger and Anita.  Because of this, Holger especially comes across VERY unlikable.  We never really get a true idea of why this man would leave his wife and his two children for a woman who he only seems to admire for her piano skills (I admit that watching her play is completely mesmerizing).  Instead, we are handed halfbaked romance that doesn't really engross us.  Howard and Bergman play their respective roles beautifully, but we cannot sympathize of relate to them, especially Howard.  Holger Brandt may have his charms and his talents, but he becomes very detached from the audience (and his reluctance to be there for his daughter is disturbing), which in the end causes the film to suffer.<br /><br />Edna Best is marvelous here, and while her character (the betrayed wife) is not really given a lot of screen time, she has enough to really sink her teeth into the part, and she becomes the most relatable and memorable character in the film.  Her final descent from the staircase, those words, just hit you in all the right places.<br /><br />The film does try and establish its moral stance, and I appreciate it for that.  The cautionary phrase delivered by Cecil Kellaway (\\"can two people find happiness built on the unhappiness of others?\\") shines brightly in the films final act and really tugs at the heartstrings of the audience.  I only wish that the entirety of the film had been as intricately woven so as to create a truly well rounded and fully realized tale.<br /><br />So, it is a good film, and it delivers on many fronts, especially in the acting categories (you really believe these characters, even if you don't necessarily fully understand them), but it lacks enough character development to make it truly relatable.oes try and establish its moral stance, and I appreciate it for that.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This band is truly what metal is all about!  Exploding out of the piles of nu metal crap this band shows why metal is the best music ever.  The vocals are amazing, the riffs are great, the songs are just amazing.  You love metal, this is metal!  Perfect album!
0312360266|1.0|Most of what needs to be said has already been said.  This was a HORRIBLE read.  Would you like to get to know a main character who drops pointless pop culture references constantly while at the same assigning absurd moral judgments just to prove how superior she is compared to the rest of the world?  I can't believe I wasted $3 on this.<br /><br />PC and Kristin Cast:  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
1595141715|5.0|Aww, this book was so sad! Unbelievably amazing, but so sad. It's a story about a girl -Hannah- who tapes herself stating the reasons why she has (already) committed suicide. I kept expecting her somehow to be alive at the end- even though you know she's dead from the very first pages. It was a book so full of emotions, I really \\"felt\\" it all the way. The author managed to leave me scarred with images of everything in my head, which is actually really good.    The plot was interesting and fast. The characters were amazing and overall the premise the book brings is really creative and original. I listened to it on audio-book (also read some parts) and really enjoyed that there were two readers, a female one as Hannah and a male one as Clay. It's a terrific book everyone should check out!
B0015519VS|1.0|This is by the wrose album he has put out...the tracks don't fit the artist in any size or shape.  It's like Usher has aged 40 years to an old man on this album..not voally but the sound of music and lyric wise....a waste of time to even listen to snippets of the songs
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Ghostbusters 1 & 2 are amazing movies and finally we get a great set with pleasing extra's.  This set features the two great films on DVD, extra commentaries and an book with notes, information and photo's from the movies.  Great set, great price.
0446567337|5.0|I absolutley, positively loved this novel, it is my favorite. I think most people who gave it lack luster reviews are just dissapointed with the ending but to me, the ending is what made it so beautiful. I recommended it to some friends and they loved it. The book has a very powerful message and that is that some people will do just about anything for the one they love, even leave them. I thought the conclusions was perfect and it actually left me with some hope, even though, like others, I was a but upset with the whole unrequited love aspect.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|i am athirteen year old girl who today finished the book little women on my kindle. to be honest i normally stay far away from classics as i can because they bore me. after reading little women, i was positively and negativley surprised. i loved learning thestory of meg, jo, beth and amy. it was much more interesting than i originally anticipated which was lovely. the charaters were all well thought outand each one had its own unique personality. my favorite charaters were jo nad laurie when they were together. they had such nice chemestry and although they had good reasons for not marrying i wish they had ended up together. for the cons of the novel well they were just some parts that had begun to bore me to the point that i continually announced to my family that i was dropping the book. however i kept reading it and it would eventually pick up again. the last fifteen percent of the book was the hardest part for me to keep focused though the ending was marvelous as it turns out. over all i thought this book was pretty good just not worth 4 or 5 stars.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I just watched it today, and here are my thoughts/comments:  1)  Very well done overall (video and audio)  2)  Mixture of Beatles, \\"classic\\" McCartney/Wings, and recent McCartney songs  3)  Concert video is straightforward with little cutaways of people talking or non-concert video footage.  4)  I personally liked the inclusion of \\"audience cam\\" footage.  I thought it blended in nicely and increased the feeling of being there.  5)  No special features in the standard 1-DVD version.  (That was okay with me.)  6)  Throughout the performance of \\"I'm Down\\" the video and audio transition between the performance and the original Beatles performance of the same song back in the 60's at Shea Stadium.  I found it to be a neat effect, but it does interrupt the \\"pureness\\" of this performance.  7)  The only other McCartney concert DVD I have seen is \\"Live in Red Square\\", which I like a lot.  \\"Red Square\\" has more interruptions, but I found those interruptions interesting (sort of like a documentary mixed in).  I don't really have a favorite between the two.  I think both are very good.
B000092Q4U|5.0|In a world filled with amazing classic bands still going strong and all the worthless crap on much music/radio it's great to have a band like Lamb Of God around to show new bands can still have amazing talent.  Metal salute in the highest to LOG \m/\m/  Amazing album!
0812973992|5.0|Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down.  It is truly one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  The language is poetic, the characters wove themselves into my heart.  While reading the words, I often felt as if I were in midair, balancing on high, as the tightrope walker did all those years ago.  Despite the losses and pain of the New Yorkers who are portrayed, there is such hope and connection in this book.  Rich and poor, black and white, different cultures, different neighborhoods, all are bridged through interlocking stories and through acts of lovingkindness.  My biggest issue with this story is that it will take me time before I am able to pick up another book.  I just don't want to let this one go.
0385504225|1.0|I loved Angles and Demons and The DiVinci Code but Lost Symbol falls well short of his earlier books.  Clearly the author wrote this book (or was commissioned)to write a screenplay for another movie.  As a result the flow of the book is choppy and almost impossible to follow.      My best guess is Dan Brown as fallen into the trap of success where he found a book theme that works and he's trying to continue the run.  However, he's not a good enough author to pull it off.
B0010HOZS0|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie Invasion. This movie is a variation of the \\"bodysnatcher's\\" genre. As with other movies of this type, those who have been \\"snatched\\" move slowly, calmly and peacefully. In this movie, that is how \\"they\\" tell those who are infected and those who are not yet infected. OK, a strange new infection is brought to earth from space. Once a person is infected (passes from person to person) they turn into these peaceful slow moving zombies. The key to the infection is to not sleep! The lead character is played by Nicole Kidman who does a great job. Interesting to watch how she learns to move about in the community of the zombies without being discovered. Usually zombie movies are low budget \\"B\\" movies; this one has high production values, looks great, and is well crafted. Call it an \\"A\\" class zombie movie. Minimal violence. This is a good movie and well worth watching. The Blu-Ray has a good selection of additional contents. I do recommend this movie.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|This album is awesome and a fine staple for this band being one of metal's top bands.  The riffs are amazing, the vocals and inhuman awesomeness, the drums are killer and the songs are epic!  Awsome band, awesome metal!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Fascinating read that had me on the edge of my seat. I personally was unaware of the roundup at the Vel d' Hiv.  Riveting, captivating....a must read!!
0307454541|3.0|Okay I just finished this book and I feel it only fair that I revise my review somewhat...So while I initially was bored and irritated with this book, I discovered that it does get better in the second half of the book...really... Nevertheless, in order to get to that better half of the book, I had to skip through much of the first part of the book in which the author spends way too much time explaining and describing what is happening instead of showing us through the actions of his characters.  It isn't until the second half of the book that the real story is revealed to us and things get interesting.<br /><br />I still probably wouldn't recommend this book as great, only okay.<br />.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the action movie Taken and shout-out for Liam Neeson in the lead role. Neeson plays a retired spy, Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter. The daughter and her girlfriend leave on a trip across Europe against the better judgement of her dad (Neeson). They barely land in Paris when they are kidnapped by slave traders. With few clues, Daddy goes to Paris to recover his daughter. Simple plot idea, extremely well executed (hence my shout-out to Neeson). This is a violent and tough movie; Neeson's body count is around 50 and most with graphic and quick kills. Don't shoot at him, you'll only make him mad! Impressive how he follows from clue to clue. If you don't mind the violence and the graphic underworld plot, it is a great movie. I do recommend it and will watch it again in the future.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|With all the hoopla surrounding Avatar, I hate to stink up the party but I just didn't think this movie was all that. I went to the theater concerned that it would be just another special effects extravaganza in search of a plot. As it turned out, Avatar is somewhat better than that, but only just barely. In fact, I think that the plot was a very good one the last time that it was used by Kevin Costner on the plains of the American mid-west. But that was twenty years ago. That said, my biggest disappointment was actually with the 3-D. I did not find this particular version of 3-D technology to be all that convincing. Apparently this technology requires that everything be shot with a very narrow depth of field, because everything on the screen except for the exact focal point of the scene was always a little out of focus. By the end of the movie I had a slight headache from the constant eye strain of trying to bring the scenery into focus. Also, I think that Mr. Cameron missed an opportunity when he elected to shoot all of the action sequences in traditional third person perspective. The 3-D effect would have had a lot more visual impact had he shot those scenes from the first person perspective. All in all I found Avatar to be good solid escapist entertainment, but not much else.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|I remember reading a while back that Disney intended to cease making hand-drawn animated films.  With the great successes enjoyed by its Pixar-partnered films, such as \\"Cars\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", etc., the company apparently felt it was no longer necessary to devote the time and work to producing hand-drawn animation.  I was sincerely upset by this news.  I'll never forget what was, to me, the golden age of Disney, with the slew of wonderful and beautiful hand-drawn films it released in the 90s.  I really enjoy the Pixar films, but I didn't want to see the death of the hand-drawn animated feature as an art form.  And make no mistake, it is an art form, and one at which Disney really excels when they do it right.  They really do it right with this film.    From the moment the film began, I had that same feeling I had when I watched my 90s favorites, such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".  The films done with computer animation are technical marvels, but there is something so special about watching the evolution of characters and scenes drawn painstakingly by hand.  Disney more or less invented this medium, and I hope to see them continue to master it.  I could say so much about the sheer beauty of this film.  Some scenes are awash with colors, as when Naveen and Tiana are literally taken out on a limb by Mama Odie.  I was also in awe of the stately New Orleans homes in Charlotte's neighborhood.  How can anyone watch something like this and not appreciate the sheer artistic talent required to make something so lovely?    The appeal of the film certainly doesn't end with the visuals.  Though it's admittedly a sanitized version of what real world New Orleans would have been like during the era, the film has a very lovely story.  Charlotte and Tiana are genuinely friends, despite the class and racial differences between them.  Big Daddy may be obscenely rich and fond of frittering away his money on frilly princess dresses for his daughter, but he's also a sincerely nice man who shares his wealth with others and treats Tiana and her mother not like servants, but like valued employees.  The animal sidekicks aren't silly and cloyingly sweet, but genuinely interesting with amusing and sweet backstories.  It's hard not to laugh when we get to witness poor Louis's attempts to play jazz with the \\"big boys\\".    As for the main characters, I really loved them.  Tiana is lovely both inside and out.  Though most of us would perhaps wish our children to be a bit less of a workaholic than she is, I admired her hard working attitude, her determination to see her dreams through to their fulfillment, and her independence.  She is a very, very welcome addition to the Disney princess line as, let's face it, not all of those princesses are the kinds of girls most mothers would want their daughters to be.  Tiana is smart, sweet, comes from a beautiful family, and has an excellent moral compass.      I thought that Naveen was probably the most interesting of the princes, many of whom are little more than a presence on film.  Though the Beast certainly had a personality and a backstory of his own, I think Naveen may have been even more developed.  He's a bit of a stereotypical royal playboy, but that's also actually kind of an interesting change for Disney, where the princes tend to be a bit bland.  Mostly, they just exist to rescue the heroine from her situation.  Tiana doesn't need rescuing, but she would benefit from the help of a loving mate.  It's interesting to see Naveen grow up and learn about taking responsibility.    Maybe some viewers will think the film is a bit too pat, but I don't think so.  Yes, things do work out magnificently for the good characters and terribly for the bad, but, to me, that's not a negative thing.  Wouldn't it be nice if that's the way it really worked in the real world?  I loved the film's message about the importance of genuine love, family, and friendship over material goods.  I loved the idea that the two leads could come tounderstand that the things they thought most important in their lives could actually be considered trivial in the grand scheme of things.  I truly enjoyed this film and hope that Disney will continue to produce more gems like it.  Sure, the Pixar films are marvelous, but there's definitely plenty or room for good old hand-drawn films as well.
0307716988|5.0|Written by the man himself, Michael Jackson gives readers a foundation of information from which to build in uncovering the mystery of who he REALLY was.  This book was written by Michael while in his late 20's so it details the first 25 years of his career as a performing artist, along with a significant amount of information he shares about his personal/family life.  This book is an invaluable resource for anyone who finds Michael Jackson intriguing and is in search of the truth, since so much has been written about him by others who are disreputable sources of information. Get to know the REAL Michael Jackson from the man himself.
0060899220|5.0|This book has been reviewed to death, so I will keep it short.  I just wanted to contribute my 5 stars to the average.  This book really deserves it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is probably one of the best sitcoms out there. The writing is smart, the cast fits perfectly and even the laughs keep coming. I should mention that the cast is probably the best part. Without each character, the show just wouldn't be the same... especially without Sheldon. He's perhaps the smartest and most annoying person on earth... but he's hilarious! If you don't believe me, check out an episode on CBS. Once you do, you'll be hooked. Best money I've spent in quite awhile.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This movie is wonderful but it does have a sad ending. I couldn't help but laugh at the message left about the kids crying at the end of the movie. All snow melts....hint hint. Anyways, I love this movie and all the adults in my family love it too. This movie is certainly creative and I will certainly have my kids watch it.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I've only watched the film once, so possibly I'm missing something, but I must say it does seem to me that the Jewish-American soldiers known as the \\"Basterds\\" of the title could have been removed from the film entirely and the main thrust of the plot, which seems to revolve around a movie theater in France, would have needed only minor alterations.<br /><br />I came into this expecting something like Hogan's Heroes on steroids, or a remake of the Dirty Dozen.  I got neither.  What we see of the \\"Basterds\\" seems to take place mostly in the basement of a tavern.  Why a tavern?  Why a basement?  The characters themselves discuss these questions, but alas if an answer was ever presented it soared right over my head.<br /><br />I spent a fair portion of the film wondering what the film was about.  Yes, it's curious that one could compare the experiences of slaves imported into the US to the experience of King Kong, imported into the US, but is this a plot point, or something meant to flesh out a character, or just a case of a film director illuminating an odd thought that came to him in the dead of night?  I'm still wondering.  But it does rather remind me of graduate students in philosophy pontificating about Kant and Spinoza and the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness and who or what stares into you when you stare into the abyss, and how very intellectual it all sounds, though it does seem a bit disconnected from anything having to do with practical reality, and what in God's name does any of it have to do with a World War Two movie?<br /><br />I'm still wondering about that, too.<br /><br />Not the most entertaining film I've ever seen.  Neither was it the least.  Hence the three stars.
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|The songs on this album are amazing.  They take our classic beatles and add a twist.  The movie is excellent, but I will put the album above the movie, simply because the movie is a bit trippy.  Regardless, I downloaded these MP3s to use as ringtones and alarms on my phone, and I am not disappointed.  It has the right amount of class that I wanted, and it's different than a typical person's ringtones.  I couldn't have found a better fit of music for me.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Excellent movie.  It successfully tied the three previous Terminator movies together with Salvation, all the way from Arnold to Skynet.  Great special effects, too. This is a MUST OWN MOVIE if you own and/or enjoy ANY of the three previous Terminator's.  The Arnold Terminator was a fantastic surprise when I saw the movie for the first time in the theater. The Arnold-factor alone truly solidifies a bond between all four movies.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|How in the world did they get this wrong?  The casting was good, the poster looks about right - but the story was non-existent.  I knew I had a problem with this movie when I could watch all three Indy movies as a kid and not have to figure out what was going on.  And ironically, as an adult, I got lost in the plotting of this meandering mess.  For those Indy fans who got their kicks - great, but this was lame.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times you read this book or watch the movie, Jane Austen beckons you to curl up with this story and a cuppa! I have the book of this but wanted to carry it around On my kindle so I could read it at any time!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of my favorite rock bands ever and are certainly one of the most inspirational. But I never listened to their music until CALIFORNICATION arrived. John Frusciante had just gotten back on the band but I did not know that before. I proceeded to work backwards and found BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK and ONE HOT MINUTE. Hearing those two albums made me see a whole new side to the band that I have previously missed. I saw a new era, felt a new feel and witnessed a new manifesto. Over time, these two albums, along with CALIFORNICATION, became my favorite records.       Add STADIUM ARCADIUM to the list. This double album follows up the disappointing BY THE WAY, which I felt to be underwhelming, and looks to follow it.     But hearing it once through, I found it to be vastly better. The songs felt fresher and the melodies were strong and consistent throughout, which wasn't the case with BY THE WAY. From the vibrant, Hendrix-inspired DANI CALIFORNIA to the softer, downbeat song DEATH OF A MARTIAN, the underlying intensity of the band never let up. There were a good variety of tempos but there was a consistent polish and feel to the songs, making this a much superior album as a whole. This showed that the band didn't just mail it in; they put their whole heart in this time.     This album also felt substantial. Two discs of 14 songs each, there was never any doubt as to the quantity this album brings. This is a first for the band, having never released a double album before. Add the fact that all these songs, even the latter ones, are all good; the fans are in for a treat. STADIUM ARCADIUM doesn't feel draggy or long at all; the sequence of the songs varies well from the up-tempo tracks to the slow ones.     John Frusciante's guitar prowess sounds like it has reached a new height here. Long-time fans, especially those who loved BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK, will know how far his skill has seen a tremendous rate of improvement over the years. Here, his solossound more complex and fuller than in previous albums, including CALIFORNICATION, while still retaining much of the emotion and virtuosity of his play. It is his tunes that drive the melodies forward, giving the album an energy and personality few other albums in the industry attain. STADIUM ARCADIUM has a very spacey theme to it and it is John's selection of scales and notes that have helped achieve that effect.    Anthony's vocals here have also reached a new height as well. One could easily hear the expansion of his range in all of the songs. He does a terrific job producing a hip-hop style for HUMP DE BUMP and an equally sublime job on the futuristic STADIUM ARCADIUM. There is power in his voice and this lends a central soul to the music.     Flea's bass has always given their albums a crucial foundation to that soul and his masterful sequences here are no exception. He has always accompanied well with John's guitar and here it takes a whole new form and maturity. Just when you thought they couldn't have thumped their previous efforts they did it here.     The beat that has been constant throughout much of their music remains to be Chad's. He doesn't tamper much with the formula that has been a trademark for much of his career. He doesn't have outrageous drum solos nor does he have the most complex of rhythms but his laid back, yet consistent, style has contributed to the catchiness of the songs.    Together, they have created something that's catchy and colorful, a bumper album with an appropriately given intergalactic theme. If you are into funk rock, you will find lots to tide you over here. In terms of sustained quality, production values, storytelling lyricism and invention, this album certainly ranks up there with my favorite rock albums of the decade and one of my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums of all time.
0892818875|5.0|I have been playing for essential oils for all my life.  I already had many books on aromatherapy before I bought this one, and this one tops them all.  The depth it goes into for each oil is unparalleled.  The author writes with such heart, you can tell the love they have for these precious oils.  I highly recommend this book for one and all.
B000ZELISO|1.0|I'll leave it to others to discuss the sorry translation from novel to film. My WARNING is about the horrendous quality of the video. I saw the original in a theater, and this Blu-ray version is a sad mess of a transfer. Dark (yes, I know the movie is \\"dark\\"), soft, erratic quality. Most scenes dim and muddy with the rare, occasional cut to something bright and contrasty. I even attempted to adjust the viewing quality twice during playback and nothing made it better. This appears to be simply a bad job of mastering or duplication and this disc should be recalled without hesitation. I've haven't seen video quality this poor since the early days of VHS.
0312330537|5.0|'Larger-than-life', 'over-the-top', these are some of the expressions that have been used to describe Shantaram.<br />Let's get the basics down first: Shantaram is a quasi-autobiographical novel by Australian author and ex-convict Gregory David Roberts. The facts narrated here, just like the characters, are fictitious but ther are largely inspired by the author's admittedly wild life.<br /><br />Shantaram is a plot-driven novel, thick with action, suspense and a large cast of intriguing characters. It is approx. 933 pages long yet it doesn't feel one bit too long.<br />The narrator escapes from a maximum-security Australian prison and subsequently lands in Bombay, where most of the action takes place. There, among other things, he ends up living in a slum, where he sets up a free health-clinic, falls in love with a mysterious Swiss-American woman, starts working for the Bombay Mafia, strikes a unlikely friedship (although things are more complicated than that...) with its ueberpowerful don, launches a movie company and fights in Afghanistan alongside the Mujahedeen (this is the war against the Russians, not the recent one).<br /><br />Roberts is no stylist so dont expect Pulitzer-level writing here, yet he's far from being an ignorant ex-convict. As a matter of fact, before getting the habit (heroin, that is), he was some sort of left-wing intellectual and his writing, while not overly sophisticated, is elegant and, yes, at times even poetic.<br /><br />A deeply engrossing novel, the perfect complement to a relaxing holiday.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a must have series in the collection of every geographic and nature lover. The photography and the detailing in the blu-ray is just very stunning! And David Attenborough's narration is very captivating. One would surely be compelled to amaze at and admire the beauty of our mother planet after watching the series. Regarding the video format, on the cover of the BBC version it says 1080i. But when I started playing my HDTV recognized the video as 1080p. So I would think the main program content is indeed in 1080p. There was some slight flickering though at some scenes, but then I would think the problem could be with the original recording itself. Buy this and you would not be disappointed for sure.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|Even though it's cheap, the Blu-ray version of this movie is not worth it because it basically looks exactly the same as the regular DVD.  I noticed an improved sound quality, but for the most part, visually it was not impressive.  There are a few special features on here like deleted scenes, a short behind the scenes thing and then some hilariously dated early 90s interviews with James Cameron and Arnold.  If this stuff can be found on one of the standard DVD, just stick with that.
0307454541|4.0|Everybody seems to agree that this book started a bit slow (do I really care about the financial Swedish sytem??!). I agree with it. Although the first 50 pages or so, for me, feel like foundation layer to much bigger issue. I think I would like to see this from three aspects: (1) The topic of financial scandal -- I don't really have interest to it. (2) The mystery of the disappearance of  a girl in a 60's -- This I love, because I always love murder mystery, and (3) Characters: Blomkvist and Lisbeth are both likeable character. Lisbeth is an ass-kicking heroine, I truly welcome in the world of fiction.<br /><br />The story is interesting and yes, after 80+ pages, the book picks up its pace and engaging until, probably the last 30 - 40 pages or so -- because I feel like it lacks some big drama. It feels like a summary or conclusion instead of knock out closure. I definitely enjoy the process of solving the mystery -- what can I say, it brings back memory of Agatha Christie's books.<br /><br />BUT, is it amazing? I have to say, \\"No\\". Murder mystery has always been my favorite genre. I know I have not read ALL great murder mystery books out there, but the intrigue and the real answer to the mystery, is not something that is unique or surprising. I don't feel surprised about the secret, I don't feel surprised about the truth of what happened to Harriett. I feel like I have read similar plot in one of those murder mysteries I read. It is not gut-punching twist (I read a number or Jeffery Deaver's stories to know about twists *g*).<br /><br />All in all, good read, of course. Will I return to Book #2, I think so. But whether it is enough to grip my emotion to make it to my Top 10 list? Not really.
B000VD5I94|2.0|The BD was indistinguishable from the standard DVD.  If you own a Blu-ray player, just buy the 20th Anniversary Edition, which looks just as good and actually has some features on it.  This version has nothing, unless you count the addition of Cantonese subtitles.  Pretty sad.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|\\"Invictus,\\" produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and an activist who strove to end apartheid, establish universal suffrage, and bring about free and democratic elections in South Africa.  After he became president, Mandela set out to heal the deep divisions that poisoned the political, social, and cultural atmosphere of his homeland.  He looked to the future, although he would never completely forget the twenty-seven years that he had spent as a political prisoner.  Mandela chose an unusual vehicle to propel his campaign of healing--rugby.  The Sprinbok team, beloved of white Afrikaners, was for the majority of black South Africans, a symbol of all that they despised.  Much to the consternation of his constituents, Mandela decided to publicly support the underdog Springboks and their captain, Francois Pienaar, hoping that a common interest in winning the Rugby World Cup would unite blacks and whites. In addition, he believed that if the Springboks were to capture the World Cup, it would shine a positive light on a nation that had previously been shunned by much of the world.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is unable to avoid the clich&eacute;s that are characteristic of come-from-behind films featuring a weak team that strives, against all odds, to win a major championship.  The close-up scenes of hulking and grunting men pummeling and tackling one another are repetitious and a bit off-putting.  For most moviegoers, however, the reason to see \\"Invictus\\" is not to revel in the game of rugby, but rather to enjoy Morgan Freeman's subtle and understated portrayal of a man so charming, eloquent, and determined that he manages to disarm even those who dismissed him as a upstart.  Mandela takes the high road, envisioning a time when blacks and whites will live together in harmony.<br /><br />Matt Damon is fine as Francois Pienaar, captain of the Springboks, who cannot believe that his hapless team has become a national symbol.  As he gets to know Mandela, Pienaar grows to respect and admire the man, and learns how important it is to inspire others and set an example that they can emulate.  Other standouts are Tony Kgoroge as the hot-tempered Jason Tshabalala (the head of Mandela's security detail) who is in no mood to reconcile with the enemy.  Adjoa Andoh brings dignity and intelligence to the role of Brenda Mazibuko, Mandela's personal assistant.  She is the voice of reason, questioning the wisdom of wasting political capital on rugby when South Africa is on the verge of economic collapse.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman said that Mandela \\"moves people for the better; that is his calling in life.\\"  This feel-good movie offers few surprises.  Some critics have called it bland and safe, and that is probably a fair criticism.  Nevertheless, \\"Invictus\\" is worth seeing for Freeman's depiction of a man who chose to forgive those whom he had every reason to hate.tional symbol.

0446607274|4.0|Someone introduced me to Michael Connelly a few months ago and I am very thankful I started at the beginning of his work with Black Echo.  Connelly does a great job of using not just the primary characters but also supplementary characters from book to book.  I'm just not sure I would enjoy the plots as much if I had not read the earlier books first.<br /><br />In Angels Flight, Harry Bosch, a veteran LAPD homicide detective (and Connelly's main character in the majority of his books), is assigned a VERY politically sensitive case.  As usual, there were lots of twists and turns which kept me from putting the book down.  I was surprised at Harry at points because he was willing to \\"go along to get along\\" ...not typical Harry.  And his luck with women continues...after Trunk Music I thought that was all behind him.  I know Michael Connelly used to be a newspaper crime writer but none of his storylines in the past reminded me of a real story.  This one brought JonBenet Ramsey to mind.  I didn't really like the ending of Angels Flight...pretty hash if you ask me.
B002YVAT72|5.0|Only had this thing for a few days only used it once but so far its great. yes the sound sucked at first like the needle was loose but i solved that by plugging it into the CD input jacks on the back of the stereo receiver instead of the phono input jacks. result is it sounds great. have not tried installing the software but i have another stereo that will install records onto cds without a computer so i use that. UPDATE the part about the crappy sound at first turns out to be a defect in the stereo receiver. I hooked a cd player into that jack and it sounded like crap.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The Bottom Line:    I'm really not a huge fan of animated movies, so let that speak for how much I enjoyed this wonderfully sweet film about a curmudgeonly old man and a lonely boy who end up going on adventures in the jungles of South America; never cloying or obvious, manipulative or hokey, this very funny and sweet film suffers a tiny bit in its slower and less moving middle passage but is nonetheless easily on my shortlist for the best films of 2009.    3.5/4
B00008G9JO|4.0|I, personally LOVE this album. If you are not a Tull FAN, I would recomend aqualung as a first buy. If you are into Prog then go straight for Think as a Brick. The compositions on heavy horses are great and the instrumental playing superb. Where this album falls short is in Ian Anderson's vocal tracks. He is clearly losing his voice at this point. It is still a great album in spite of the gruffer vocal quality.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|One of the most interesting elements I found in \\"North by Northwest\\" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall. Here is a strong, sophisticated, and independent young woman that is neither played as a bitch nor merely eye candy for the hungry male audience. I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts. In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today. A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago. If the times have changed, many of the movies surely haven't.    One of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself. For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him. Even in this scene, where Eve is the \\"bad guy\\", she is able to show just how much she deeply cares for this man. Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.    Here is a character that is not only sexual but innocent. She is neither exploited for her actions nor is she looked down on for being a female of carnal needs. If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get. In this aspect alone, \\"North by Northwest\\" was a movie years ahead of its time.

B001RL4K1Q|4.0|Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film that has left me perplexed ever since the first time I viewed it as a teenager nearly a decade ago. I remember, as I finished the film, thoroughly hating it. There was something about its subject matter and characters that I immediately found off putting. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing of the picture that I really understood what Boyle was going for.    It's supposed to be off putting and the characters are supposed to be unlikable. The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life. It destroys it to the point where heroin because the only that the really matters. For these young drug addicts, the only thing that gets them through the day is the anticipation of the next hit. By using over-the-top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.    If I have a problem with the film it's that it really doesn't go far enough. Less quick cutting and hyper stylized editing and more human characters would have made the film deeper and more palatable. But, maybe that wasn't what Boyle was going for. With his use of editing, he shows just how much can be lost when one is stuck in the sad world of drug addiction. That, in and of itself, makes the film something special. The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today. I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film.
0786838655|4.0|After seeing the preview for the movie, I picked up the first 3 books in this series.  It was an easy book to read and the characters were likeable.  The way the author combined ancient Greek myths into the story set in modern times was terrific and will probably launch many copy-cats.  For being an \\"action\\" story it lagged in places, but the ending was very strong and really made me look forward to reading the next book in the series.  I liked that the author made Percy's ADHD and dyslexia assets and \\"explained\\" the need/existence of the \\"disorders\\" (just as the original myths explained the unexplainable).
B002P93VGO|1.0|The Blu-ray version does not load on my Media center PC.  I upgraded my player firmware and playback software to Cyberlink 9 ultra - 3 other blu-ray movies I recently purchased run flawlessly (District 9, UP and Harry Potter 6).    I suspect it has to do with an updated encryption scheme, but this is Junk.  Hopefully this is just a bad copy - Amazon has promised a replacement, I cannot ask for anything more!
0439023483|4.0|I enjoyed this book and will certainly seek out the next in the series to read.  The world in which this story is set is typical \\"dystopian\\" with strong control by a central, manipulative government.  This YA book will easily grab the imagination and interest of most adults as well.  Some events are brutal, but not gory.  The characters are realistically created with strenghts and weaknesses.  The author spun an interesting survival tale with tid-bits of \\"coming of age\\" stories.  When I first finished the book I thought I was satisfied with the ending and didn't need to run out to read the next, but as I reflected on the story, I realized there are many questions I am desperate to see answered in the next installment.  Very enjoyable read.
1401323820|1.0|I'm a big fan of the TV show \\"Castle\\".  However, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on.  I'd like to know who actually wrote the book, so I can avoid reading anything else by this author.  The plot was elementary and I figured out who did it well before the midway point.  Anyone who watches crime Tv could figure it out.  It makes me sad that a tree had to die to produce this \\"novel\\".  Any 5 star review you read, was probably written by ABC marketing division.
1416594787|5.0|While many will no doubt already know much of the material contained in the book, seeing the case for evolution as fact built in a step by step manner, makes for quite a good read while also providing excellent answers for anyone who questions any aspect of evolution by natural selection. Anyone who actually wants to learn about evolution and its undoubted existence would be advised to read this book. The only people who will not be convinced are those unconvinceable fanatics who do and always will ignorantly believe in a young earth and require no evidence to back up this claim.
015206057X|3.0|...because not quite EVERY baby has ten little fingers...we received this as a gift from a friend's mother for our baby shower, and thought it was quite cute.  Ironically enough, our son was born with TWELVE fingers, because uncomplicated polydactyly runs in my husband's family.  While this surprised us (it seemed to have skipped my husband's generation, which it's not supposed to do), it wasn't a big deal, as the fingers were little more than skin tags, and easily removed at 6 months of age; however, it did make this book a little inappropriate/awkward for our son, as we don't want him feeling excluded, since he once had two extra!  A great book, just wait until baby shows up (and a thorough digit count has been done!) to buy it...
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Got this album right after it came out actually. I'm a huge fan of Slayer and I wasn't disappointed with World Painted Blood. In fact, this album stayed in my cd player for quite a long time. It's that good. The songs are excellent, blood curdling and thrashing and I love it!. Tom's voice hasn't been this angry in a while and of course the duo of Hanneman (RIP brother!)and King dish out some killer riffs. My favorite song is Hate Worldwide but the entire album is full of great songs. The production is trebly and raw, reminds me of punk rock. What else can I say, it's a really good album from legends that never cease to amaze me. Highly recommended.
B002VKE0XA|3.0|I finally got around to watching the Paranormal Activity Blu tonight.<br /><br />First off, the disc has no extras, zero menus, zilch.  You get two options, Theatrical cut and unrated cut.  The unrated cut is basically just the work print with remastered sound.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  During interviews some of the people involved in the film revealed that there were a handful of endings shot for the film, why weren't those included?  On top of that I'd really have loved to see a commentary and maybe a featurette on the marketing of this film, how it went from sitting on the shelf to number one at the box office.<br /><br />The film itself is enjoyable.  It's a little slow and a tad predictable, but I found it to be fun the second time around, it's certainly a film in the vein of the Blair Witch Project...Low budget, raw, and an invisible antagonist.  I will admit it does get a little slow in the middle, tedious even, but if you get scared easily or you have an active imagination it will be a very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The picture quality isn't going to be the best obviously, the sound is a little muffled also...But that's how it was shot.<br /><br />With the lack of features and the quality of the film I wouldn't suggest buying it on the Blu format unless you can find it cheap.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Who would have thought that a little 8-song album (or EP, depending on how you look at it) by an artist that has practically just started their career would be the album of the year? Certainly not me! I enjoyed \\"The Fame\\" but it got old after awhile. \\"The Fame Monster\\" is the answer to that. Unlike \\"The Fame\\" it has no filler, and any song released will be a sure hit! Personally, I love \\"Bad Romance\\" and once I start listening to it, I have to put it on repeat. It is the most addicting song I've heard in a long time. \\"Alejandro\\" is super catchy and \\"Monster\\" is a sure club hit!    My personal favorite track is \\"Speechless.\\" I didn't like the thought of her doing a ballad and didn't like the preview, but when I heard the full song I was blown away. Lyrics like that have to come from the heart. It is about her dad refusing to do open-heart surgery. (Thankfully after she wrote this song he went through with the surgery and it saved his life!) GaGa also said it was a reminder to fans to appreciate their parents. Next is \\"Dance in the Dark\\" which is another sure club hit. It is great to dance to.    Next, we get \\"Telephone,\\" her duet with Beyonce, released about the same time as their duet \\"Video Phone (Remix)\\" on Beyonce's \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" re-release. The one on this album is far more superior as I never liked \\"Video Phone\\" and even GaGa couldn't fix that. \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" makes me very happy. It's another favorite of mine. It ends with \\"Teeth\\" which is the craziest of all the tracks. She dares her man to \\"Take a bite of [her] bad girl meat\\" and tells him to \\"She [her] your teeth.\\"    Overall, it's an amazing album. The lyrics in \\"Bad Romance,\\" \\"Dance in the Dark,\\" and \\"Monster\\" ARE censored, but the songs are so amazing that getting this CD is still worth it, TRUST ME! It has dance tracks (Monster, Dance in the Dark), Heartbreak (Speechless), Sex (So Happy I Could Die, Teeth), and Relationships (Bad Romance, Alejandro) to make this the perfect little 8-track album. (Not to be confused with an 8-track tape, it is an fact a CD. But hey, albums from the 80's used to only have 8 or 9 songs).
0061733199|5.0|Like my title says, this book really does have everything.  It has everything from what to do when a shark attacks to what bugs and plants you can eat to how to build animal traps and shelters.  The only thing I would have changed is the pictures - for things like what plants to eat, it would have been nice to have actual photos instead of drawings.  Some of the entries are a little brief, but that is quite understandable considering how much they crammed into a single book.  A very fun book, even for the person not so adventure-inclined.  Highly recommend!
B0002S947K|5.0|Bought this CD for the sole purpose of having the song \\"Trouble\\". We have never heard of Ray Lamontagne, but fell in love with his song on the Travelers Insurance commercial (a must see for any dog lovers!). Not only is Trouble a great song, but the entire CD is fantastic! It is now a permanent part of our \\"rotation\\" and would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates good music.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received this album for Christmas and have listened to it three times.  I love every song on it.  Her incredible voice comes through in every song.  My one small complaint is that two songs have too much chorus and not enough Susan.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I'm a musician, have collected all the various Beatles releases (from the original LPs , including the 1/2 speed masters by Mobile Fidelity to recent remastered CDs and the Beatles Rock Band PS3 etc.) and this is the best sounding issue so far.    my wife and I have spent several evenings , with the lights down, listening to this FLAC edition... the sound is wonderful and at times amazingly better.. having heard these songs hundreds of times, it's like being there when they recorded.    We agreed on an order for listening to the albums and intended to play through each non-stop, but often a song is so striking that we want hear it again and we end up replaying a song.. or an album.    The White Album, Abbey Road , Magical Mystery Tour and Rubber Soul have been our favorites so far.. I'm so happy to have this    I have no doubt that the \\"limited release of 30,000) refers specifically to the packaging (the apple) and that we will see another version released .. if you missed this .. get it then.. if you love the Beatles .. you'll cherish the sound quality.

They all have no memory of an outside world.  All they know is that there is a maze and they will try to find a way out -but every night the doors to the maze will shut.<br /><br />The day after Thomas arrives, a girl, the first ever in the Glade, arrives with a note that she is the last.  Thomas is determined to figure out what is happening in the Glade and unlock the secrets that are buried.<br /><br />THE MAZE RUNNER is the start to a thrilling new trilogy.  If you are a fan of dystopian science fiction, then this title needs to be added to your must-read pile.<br /><br />Author James Dashner has a brilliant start to the book; the Gladers use different slang, which takes some time to get used to.  However, this leaves the reader feeling just as jarred as Thomas when the book starts and you find yourself learning about the Glade right along with the main character. I've never really had that experience with a book before, so kudos to Mr. Dashner for a brilliant storytelling device.<br /><br />The story has somewhat of a slow start, but readers who stick with it will be rewarded.  I'm warning you - there are lots of cliffhangers and heart-stopping adventure, and you'll want to stay up late turning pages to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sarah Bean the Green Bean Teen Queen
B000J670ZI|5.0|Bringing Up Baby seems to be the kind of movie that you either like it or you don't like it.  There doesn't seem to be an in between on it.  The comedy in this movie is not really meant to be on National Lampoon level, but more of a light-hearted chuckle.  I think the chemistry between Grant and Hepburn was amazing and this movie had me laughing the whole way through.  Some of the jokes you had to \\"read in between the lines\\" and do a little research on the movie to get all the jokes.  I think Hepburn was just wonderful in the role of Susan.  She reminded me so much of Parker Posey in this.  If you are looking for a classic movie that is meant as a light-hearted laugh at silly antics, then you will love this movie.
0143116053|3.0|This story never got off the ground for me.  At page 100, I was still waiting for some recognizable plot.  As a hard-of-hearing person, I didn't much get into the whining about losing his hearing, which is really what this novel is about...mostly.  I am also a linguist, so I thought I would find more to relate to, but the writing is so utterly tedious and it just never kicks into gear.  I was led to believe from reviews that this book is about his involvement with a mysterious doctoral student, but this is really more of a side story than the main plot...too bad, because that part was intriguing.  In fairness, there are a few comical moments, and even more than a few observations I could relate to about being hard-of-hearing (how do those little battery doors wind up closed when I have so carefully opened them before placing them in the drawer?), but the stream-of-consciousness ruminating is just not very interesting. I'll keep trying to understand why this book made a list of the best books of 2009.....
B001HN69AE|5.0|Even though DBE is VERY OOC, it still follows the basic DB magna/anime canon timelines. I do and do not like how the characters meet, also I missed Puar...where was my favorite kitty? The reason why I gave it five stars because it was true to the canon in the overall effect, Bulma shoots at Goku, Yamcha and Bulma fall for each other at first sight, the way King Piccolo was \\"killed\\". I have to say I did like the first wish better, for that thank goodness for no Oolong and how DBE made ChiChi to be a very strong woman, even though this is seen in DB/Z/GT but to not as strong degree.    I do hope however in the second one it is more canon, ie Bulma's hair is blue (like her streaks) or magna purple and it is more canon, and more japanese like than american. Seriously, couldn't they ask Akira Toriyama for help or someone who helped developed the DB/Z/GT animes???
1903307414|5.0|THE FIRST TEXT TO EXAMINE COURT PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE DEFENCE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />ASBOs--Anti Social Behaviour Orders - are `a key element of this government's social policy' as the foreword to this thoroughgoing and scholarly legal text reminds us - and as they are firmly entrenched, will likely continue on into the 2010 government as well even with much heralded revisions.<br /><br />Originally - around 2003 as we recall - ASBOs sounded like a good idea.  They were designed to address the real and vexing problems and distress created by certain behaviour which involves harassment and intimidation.<br /><br />Garden Court Chambers barrister, Maya Sikand, writing for the admirable Legal Action Group (LAG) takes the view with this guide, we surmise, that ASBOs have become as widely misused as they are used, targeted as they apparently are, mainly against the young and the mentally disordered.<br /><br />ASBOs are all too often now used to deal with `disturbed or dysfunctional conduct' rather than that which is `serious and threatening.' And herein lies the difficulty, notwithstanding the Human Rights Act!<br /><br />Where is that magic line between `disturbed or dysfunctional', and `serious and threatening', behaviour? And who is qualified to judge, either during the disturbing event itself, or afterwards in court relying on the often dubious benefits of imperfect recollection and hindsight?<br /><br />The author deals with the problem rationally, citing the question of, `what should be considered before an ASBO is applied for?' at the top of the list of at least nine key issues discussed in the text.<br /><br />As a legal text, ASBOs is unique as the first book on this rapidly developing subject written in the context of human rights law from the standpoint of a practitioner acting for the defendant and very much a stable publication for LAG. Not only does it tackle the issues, but it deals with the procedural safeguards and the admissibility of hearsay and much more... not to mention, as Edward Fitzgerald QC says in the foreword, `the special problems of juveniles subject to ASBOs' with the attendant wrong sort of publicity.<br /><br />Commenting further, Fitzgerald says that the book is:<br /><br />`not just scholarly and comprehensive.  It is above all, practical, clear and helpful.  I came to the issue with little prior knowledge of ASBOs.  Having read it, I feel equipped to represent people on ASBOs at all levels and sufficiently informed to engage in the wider debate as to the fair and civilized legal response to the real life issues of anti-social behaviour.'<br /><br />A masterful and easily accessible guide to a complex and fraught subject, \\"ASBOs\\" is an authoritative reference for now, certainly for defence lawyers and also for example, for criminal and housing practitioners, local authorities, the police and the judiciary, or indeed anyone working in the youth justice system and/or organizations dealing with the young, or those with mental health or learning difficulties.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the effect on this `fair and civilised' procedural sanction with the new 2010 government's criminal justice bill, so we'll need a new revised edition, Maya!<br /><br />ISBN:1-903307-1-41-4procedural safeguards and the admissibility of hearsay and much more... not to mention, as Edward Fitzgerald QC says in the foreword, `the special problems of juveniles subject to ASBOs' with the attendant wrong sort of publicity.

B0025KVLRO|5.0|I am 60 years old now. When the Beatles first 2 albums came out, on VJ and Capitol(American versions) we as kids were very excited. It was all we could talk about. I love the British versions, done better. My son bought me all the stereo remasters. My main point is that mono was a preferred version because most of us had mono players. Technology wasn't good for stereo. Stereo would not be effective for a few years after. I've heard mono and stereo. Buy both. The first album was a milestone in rock music. Showed that they could play music made by girl groups as well as music they wrote. Enjoy!  Tom Petkavitch (S.C.)
1847030688|5.0|THAT RAPIDLY CHANGING AREA OF LAW THAT `ATTRACTS COLOURFUL CHARACTERS'<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're involved as a practitioner in any aspect of bailment, you'll certainly need the new and latest edition of this definitive and authoritative work on the subject -- the first to be published after an 18 year gap.  Since then, as the author puts it, the subject has moved with the times... both in doctrinal development and in commercial application.'<br /><br />Lucidly and engagingly written by Professor Norman Palmer, this definitive work, not only provides comprehensive analysis of bailment, with guidance on litigation and pleading, but illuminates what Palmer refers to as `the alluring qualities of bailment' which, in his words, `remains largely the child of the common law'.<br /><br />Palmer then refers, intriguingly in the preface, to that engaging feature of bailment; the `beguiling dramatis personae that haunt its pages'.  Remember the one about the compulsive shopper who hoarded thousands of unpacked merchandise in her apartment?  It and any number of numerous other examples pertaining to bailment should provide you with much erudite insight and certainly entertaining reading if you are of a mind to bring your knowledge and understanding of bailment completely up to date.<br /><br />`These newcomers, says the author, now join `the bear-skinning septuagenarian doctor, the \\"home alone\\" daughter, the deciduous brothel client, (yes, `deciduous') the deviant coachman and the denizens of past editions'.<br /><br />These are the ordinary folk, he adds `whose concerns have served to illuminate higher principle and keep the law of bailment down to earth.'  Bailment retains and presents `an endearing humanity for all its significant and advanced commercial importance.' Do look at the picture `Bailed Up' by Tom Roberts on page two with the definitions over the centuries... just to refresh your memory, of course!<br /><br />There's much new material to consider, including crime and the proceeds of crime, limitation periods, conflict of laws, equity, restitution, damages and practice and procedure.  Other new chapters include such areas as transmissible leases, insurance taxation, insolvency, shipping contracts, air carriage, animal bailments, the human body, and mixtures and fixtures, together with an enlarged section on title retention and the points of difference between bailment and gift.<br /><br />As bailment, in Palmer's words, stands `at the point at which contract, property and tort converge,' it encompasses virtually the whole commercial spectrum and is of great value to the advocate.  With an approach that is both humane and scholarly, Palmer's monumental 2220 page work of 43 chapters and five important appendices is frequently cited in court by judges at every level, including the House of Lords (the UK Supreme Court), the Privy Council, the Court of Appeal and in virtually every common law jurisdiction.<br /><br />The law is stated as at October 2009, and this new edition of \\"Palmer\\" is most welcome, mixing as it does the definitive statement of bailment law with its human face.<br /><br />We, as practitioners, so often find these characters in tort and contract actions adding colour to the necessarily heavy black and white prose of this elite class of textbook which Lord Bingham accurately describes as \\"commanding recognition as an important source of authority\\" from the immense scholarship of Norman Palmer- how right these leading legal figures are as he stands and delivers the subject!<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-847-03068-9ew material to consider, including crime and the proceeds of crime, limitation periods, conflict of laws, equity, restitution, damages and practice and procedure.

0307454541|4.0|I liked this book.  I must confess that it started slow for me, and that I actually put it aside for several days.  But once it got moving, it really held my attention.  I liked the characters, found the mystery interesting, and appreciated how Larsson weaved several different story lines into the plot. I have ordered the second book in the trilogy and am looking forward to it.<br /><br />I DO recommend this book.  Just give it a little time to develop.

B002BIULQ2|1.0|Oh my gosh this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! I feel ashamed for ridiculing Jaws II, Superman III, Batman & Robin (but that does not excuse them for being bad films). But none of them had a main character as shallow as this! Even Bella from Twilight had her parents interests in mind when she ran away with the \\"vampires\\" to escape the evil blood suckers (though I'm still in shock that I'm defending that film!). There aren't enough words for me to describe how bad this was. Nineteen minutes in felt like the length of the film. I can't even call this a film, it was a giant plug for Miley Cyrus and her father. Half the cast of the television series isn't even in it except for Emily Osment and I would much rather hear her sing than Cyrus. Basically all we get is an extended episode filled with more songs by this \\"sensation\\". I cringed as every song was played and the only other person besides Miley and the cameo people who got to sing was her father (the ONLY reason she got this role anyways) and he's a bad singer to boot. Worst of all (if its not that already), not one song is performed live. Everything is lip-synched. Not a very confident performer are you? Meryl Streep and the rest of the Mamma Mia! cast aren't professional singers (then again, neither is Cyrus or her father) and they sang most of their songs live! All the comedic moments were unfunny (even when she hurts herself), I can't remember a movie where I didn't even smile. Even the crappy movie version of Bewitched got ONE laugh out of me! The editing was sloppy and the slow motion effects made the ones used in Twilight look credible. But a few things I did learn from this picture:<br />1. Hannah Montana is the ONLY celebrity that anyone can like (That's what they give off in the film. There's not a single person who doesn't like her).<br />2. Hannah Montana can outsell the Beatles<br />3. If you lie to someone, you can solve everything by building a chicken coop<br />Seriously, everyone she hurts in this film (her best friend, her brother, her dad, her dad's love interest and her own love interest) forgives her despite the fact that she made her friend feel left out at her own birthday, didn't see her brother off to college, ruining the dinner party her dad's girlfriend set up, stands up AND lies to the guy who likes her (heck, she even manages to rip off Mrs. Doubtfire as well. But I can't understand why anybody in their right mind would like her anyway) and doesn't even remotely feel grateful for being with her family. But don't worry, build a chicken coop and all is forgiven. Then she reveals her identity, sings a song and everyone in town promises to keep her \\"secret\\" safe (Clark Kent had a more convincing disguise) Yeah I'd run out and sell her out for money! All in all, a badly put together film filled with bad songs, bad actors and a person whose fame I can't wait to get over! If people want family entertainment, I suggest they look elsewhere, Disney would be ashamed at what his company has become! Mediocre films, mediocre television shows and horrible actors have blackened what used to be a very good animation/film company. I mean, have you people who've given this a good review actually seen the shows on Disney Channel? None of which are half as funny as the \\"live studio audience\\" make it appear. The \\"cleverness\\" of the Hannah Montana writers (if thats what you want to call them) to take song titles from famous groups like The Beatles and ABBA to make episode titles like Promma Mia (I roll my eyes every time I see that one and makes me sick that she auditioned with that song). To think that this is the same company that gave us ACTUAL family films like the Witch Mountain films, The Parent Trap (the original of course, not that remake with the trashy Lindsay Lohan), Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Swiss Family Robinson and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea! This should've been the actual finale but nope! We endured another season and the actual finale wasjust to copy the plot of the film!just to copy the plot of the film!

B001TOD92C|1.0|This movie is actually OK, but it portraits wrestling as if it wasn't a battle to the death. This might be because real wrestling is not suitable to a younger audience which the makers most likely wanted to attract (they play videogames in the movie, as just one example, and the wrestler talks to a couple of kids at one point), or the special effects neccessary to make the death scenes look real were just too expensive. And the fact that a pro wrestler would work in a grocery store when not on stage killing his opponent is hard to swallow.  There are just too many errors here to rate the film higher than one star.

0439023483|4.0|My first reaction to the story's premise of The Hunger Games was one of disgust: a society which uses teenagers to exploit their own twisted sense of entertainment. How could such a book be marketable? But then, after reading the book and taking a step back to ponder its message, it made much more sense. As repulsive as the image is in the book, the author WANTS you to feel this disgust: that is the point. This form of barbarity, where twenty four teenagers are randomly chosen to fight the death each year as part of a punishment for a rebellion years ago in Panem, is hardly even questioned by those in the twelve districts. No one seems to want to confront its amorality or ruthlessness, or is afraid to do so. While reading, I was reminded a little of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", where a town holds a ritualistic \\"lottery\\" each year. In this story, names are drawn to see who will be stoned to death, and the people in this town have such a lighthearted and accepting manner about this ritual that the ending is jolting and disturbing to the reader. Much of the same can be said for The Hunger Games, although we know up front what will take place, and wait with a sense of suspense as to how the main characters will try to survive. The Hunger Games, much like \\"The Lottery,\\" illustrates the corruptibility of government, and the dangers and destruction of blindly conforming to traditions without any thought process.     The Gamemakers of the Capitol seem to hold all the cards once the games begin. They can manipulate the weather, send contestants supplies (such as medicine or food) via sponsors, or even change the rules of the game to conform to their entertainment. The contestants are not only battling themselves, but outside forces as well, such as mutant animals, starvation, poisonous food, and their own popularity--if they don't become \\"popular\\" in the eyes of the Gamemakers, then they will have a tougher road to survival. While I understand the idea of the Capitol being a larger-than-life enemy, a Big Brother, the idea that they can do things like shift the weather, deplete contestants of critical resources (such as drying up a lake), and play favoritism seemed a little silly and convenient for the story. However, perhaps this is a statement about our current modes of entertainment, with reality television and media taking over public opinion and perception with a \\"winner take all\\" mindset (American Idol, Survivor, The Apprentice come to mind). Society is sometimes favorable--or antagonistic-- towards what is out there in the media spotlight. We see this in The Hunger Games, as the Gamemakers push main characters Katniss and Peeta into this \\"star-crossed lovers\\" theme to add a dimension to the game, making them more favorable in the viewers' eyes.     While we don't learn much about minor characters, the two main characters are strongly developed. Katniss and Peeta both have moments where they want to rebel against the Capitol and Hunger Games. Early on, Peeta tells Katniss that he doesn't \\"want them to change me in there. Turn me into some monster.\\" Keeping your identity is the recurring theme that Katniss reflects on during the games.  Katniss also seems disgusted by the Games as well, and while she does play by the rules, she looks for a way of rebellion. However, the Games are too large for them, and one gets the sense that they have to give in.     If there is one annoyance, it is the first person point of view, with Katniss narrating. While this helps Katniss draw sympathy from the reader, it detracts from the overall effects of the story, and the resolution also becomes a bit anti-climatic. Also, her moving back and forth in her narration kills some of the suspense in a present day scene. She also has distracting and overly long inner-monologue about Peeta and her friend that seems to be \\"shoved\\" in the reader's face. Had the author chosen a third-person narrator describing the action, it would have been more effective.Collins' novel is a commentary about the harshness of exploitation, the overindulgence of real-life as entertainment. Moralistically, we should be upset and disgusted by a society so rigid, harsh and backwards. This is a book surely to bring about discussion, and it is best to reflect on the bigger picture of the book, its underlying message, rather than seeing it at face value.
B002R68U7K|3.0|Just received my singles collection box the other day.     THE GOOD: Box design and CD sleeve and artwork design good. The remastered audio in the CD singles have good soundstage. The remastered video is sharp with good colour balance and contrast on almost every clip.    THE BAD: Box is a bit tight to house all 29 CD singles and 1 DVD in their respective sleeves, removing and inserting the discs took some effort. The spine of some CD sleeves were slightly wrinkled due the squeezing inside the box.    Each CD single only have 2 tracks, almost all singles have one remix and one album track. Should include more remixes, non-album and rare version tracks on each single.    Music soundtrack on the DVD is standard stereo but sounded interior to the 2004 DVD release \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\". Soundtrack not properly remastered to take advantage of the high fidelity DVD stereo.    Video for new single \\"3\\" not included.    CONCLUSION: Box and CD sleeves good for display in your AV or Britney's collection with just a standard offering of the contents for Britney's fans.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|From the opening interview with Christoph, the creator of The Truman Show, where he very quickly and rather arrogantly states: \\"Yes, It is staged but it is not fake\\" I was hooked.  Gott in himmel (god in heaven)!, what could that possibly mean?  I suppose Cristoph the creator and producer is telling us that, even though every aspect of Truman's life is staged, his reaction to the scripted events are real.  While he may have a point it occurred to me that perhaps Cristoph could predict within a fairly specific range of possible reactions, how Truman might react to a particular stimulus.  So are we all being played?<br /><br />What do we learn from the masses who are watching Truman's life as it unfolds?  Do they see in the scripting of his life, how scripted and mundane their own lives have become?  Do they yearn to break free from the yoke of routine, of sameness or do they, in fact, find some comfort and safety in routine?  How will they react as Truman discovers the truth about his life?  Sit down, enjoy the ride and prepare your brain and your preconceived notions about what is life and living to be twisted painfully in the wind!

0375703861|4.0|This book is about 450 pages long, give or take.  It should have been either 600 pages or 300 pages, I'm not sure which.<br /><br />That's not really a criticism as such.  On the contrary, the virtues of \\"White Teeth\\" are so intriguing that I wanted either a fuller, more comprehensive story of these characters and their lives, or else a tighter, more gripping version with the less fully-realized elements cut out.  What we have here is manifestly the work of a young author, terrifically excited by her ideas and abilities, anxious to get it all said.  She's not unlike some of her own younger characters in that way, which is rather charming.  All the more remarkable that Zadie Smith, in her early twenties, also presented some believable older characters with a cooler (not necessarily wiser) approach to life.<br /><br />Thematically, this book wants to investigate the difficulties of immigrants to England (particularly people of color) and their London-born children.  The issues facing such people are, of course, significant, and the second generation of the novel's two main families find various ways of establishing identities for themselves - some workable and some less so.  None of this material is new; novelists have been confronting it for close to a hundred years, and at first I wondered why we needed yet another book on the subject.  Indeed, from time to time \\"White Teeth\\" runs afoul of the tendency to discuss the issue explicitly.  Most of the time, though, Ms. Smith is careful to show the emotional cost of this identity confusion to parents and children both, and there's a good enough balance of humor and pain to make the story engrossing.<br /><br />A lot of current novels seem to think they can dispense with classic structure - the movement from beginning to middle to end in three acts - and simply throw a lot of imaginative detail and clever prose into a stew.  I'm happy to report that Ms. Smith was too smart for that, but unfortunately she didn't quite have the chops to pull off the nifty structural idea she came up with to replace the classic form.  \\"White Teeth\\" begins by kicking off tales from a variety of countries and historical periods, gradually coming to focus on two families: native Englishman Archie Jones, his much younger Jamaican-born wife Clara Bowden, their daughter Irie, Archie's old World War II Army buddy, the Bangaldeshi Samad Iqbal, Samad's much younger wife Alsana, and their twin boys Mittal and Magid.  The whole bunch of them, and the clever but insular Chalfen family of English Jews, gradually move toward a final confrontation one New Year's Eve at a London museum, bringing with them two kinds of religious fundamentalism, scientific controversy, political activism, adolescent sexual hysteria, homesickness, and a generous helping of good will.  In short, the novel begins in a diffuse panorama of miscellany, and concentrates its focus bit by bit to a pinpoint by the last few pages.<br /><br />I may have seen a similar design elsewhere, but if so I can't remember it.  What's more, because the characters are distinct, funny, heartbreaking, ridiculous and real, one wants to follow them straight through the plot to that museum no matter what distractions occur.  Works fairly well.  I have a hunch it would have worked much better if Ms. Smith had introduced all her characters and themes as early as possible and followed them to her last page in some sort of rhythm.  As it is, she seems to pull in elements whenever her story happens to call for them, which makes the novel rather stumble around at times.<br /><br />Add to this structural weakness an overabundance of incident and character and you've got something very good rather than excellent.  Like a lot of first-time authors, Ms. Smith never threw away a single idea.  There's an account of Archie and Samad's convoluted war adventures, the history of Clara's family and its dedication to the Jehovah's Witnesses, Irie's body-image problems, Samad's desperate attempts to mold at least one of his sons into a good Muslim, the scene at Archie and Samad's favorite post-work hangout, Samad's endless insistence on his great-grandfather's heroism during the Indian Mutiny, at least two secret extremist organizations, and on and on.  It's a mark of Ms. Smith's ability that I actually wanted more of all of it.  For a mid-length novel, though, it's a bit much.<br /><br />This is not even to bring up the question of what the book's title means.  Teeth get a mention from time to time, and I half-expected someone to remark on the supposedly brilliant choppers of people of color; turns out that the image of white teeth is one of those metaphors that doesn't really refer to anything.  Not enormously important, merely a trifle confusing, but the title does emphasize the occasional over-richness of this particular dessert.  Maybe that's what Zadie Smith meant when she admitted, in a recent interview, that today she finds her first novel \\"nauseating\\".  She's being unnecessarily hard on herself; \\"White Teeth\\" is far from nauseating.  At most, it produces a mild case of indigestion.<br /><br />Fortunately, unlike over-rich foods, indulging in over-rich fiction like this is not bad for your health.

B000SQJ27I|5.0|I first discovered Manu Chao on a visit to Europe in 2002 and have been a huge fan ever since.  I've heard perhaps 2 songs on all of his albums that I didn't just love!  - and none I haven't liked at least a little.  One of the songs on this album - Me Llaman Calle - is the theme song for the movie Princesas set in Madrid.  English is my primary language, then French and limited Spanish, so I can't tell you for sure, but I believe Manu Chao wrote the song specifically for the movie - and it adds the perfect balance to make a good movie great.  In any language this music is groundbreaking!  More of the English speaking world needs to discover this amazingly talented artist.  Keep it coming!!!
B002R5V7MG|4.0|The inaugural gala of Los Angeles Philharmonic on October 9, 2009 conducted by our young conductor and legitimate pride for the music that really need to be enlivened, could not be more successful. Because and far beyond I would just to make two simple observations respect the execution, it would be unfair to ignore the emotion that impregnated the Walt Disney Hall will be reminded during years to come. The interpretation of the first work John Adams' \\"City Noir\\", was  a real tour de force for most the instruments of the Orchestra. Excel phrasing, articulation, color and rotund balance made of this execution a superb entry for the main dish.<br /><br />Mahler's First Symphony was performed with radiant vitality and several formal liberties. The result would have been perfect if not (to my mind) two details of execution and approach.<br /><br />The first movement was conducted with a very clear slow tempo. Such conception made the dramatic tension of the coda experienced a visible lack of intensity, due the expected fluidity that led to the climax didn't reach the top. On the other hand in the second movement the oboes and clarinets brightened by their absence and didn't make feel themselves, being shadowed by metals and strings.<br /><br />Our distinguished conductor likes to perform this Symphony. And we really hope and wish that the next year he gets to achieve a renowned status among the well renowned conductors in Mahler, due we will commemorate the 150th anniversary's eve year of Mahler's birth. So, I guess that probably we will have at short term, the integral symphonies in live or studio recordings not only by this notable orchestra.<br /><br />Kudos for Gustavo and the success accompanies you for a long, long time.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|The Element of Freedom CD is Key's foray into the pop, electronic sound. Most of the songs on this CD have strong pop influences with airy 80's instrumentation and electronic, digital moods.<br /><br />Maybe Alicia needed the \\"freedom\\" to delve into any musical genre she wants without people boxing her into one particular sound. Well, she jumped into the pop sound full force with her latest effort.<br /><br />Alicia began her career in 2001 as a fresh, new, young, innovative soul, r&b based musician and vocalist. Her first CD - \\"Songs in A minor\\" - my personal favorite - sold over 12 million copies and won her 5 Grammy's. Her second CD - \\"Diary of Alicia Keys\\" sold over 8 million and garnered 4 Grammy's.  Both CD's were soulful, r&b successes.<br /><br />Her third CD \\"As I Am\\" gave us a hint of where she was going with her music - a more adult contemporary, pop sound mixed with her trademark soul and r&b. It turned out to be very successful with over 6 million copies sold and winning 3 Grammy's.<br /><br />\\"The Element of Freedom\\" gives us more adult contemporary, pop with a structure of soul and r&b.<br />Her opening song, \\"Love is blind\\" is a Rihanna type song that is very good but doesn't seem like a song Alicia would sing. I like the East Indian influence in the music and background vocals.<br /><br />\\"Doesn't mean anything\\" is a very good pop song with a sound that reminds me of her hit \\"No one\\".<br /><br />\\"Try sleeping with a broken heart\\" is another very good pop song with a 80's electronic, digital sound to it.<br /><br />\\"Wait to you see my smile\\" is a sweet, uplifting, pop song that will make you smile.<br /><br />\\"That's how strong my love is\\" is a very good ballad that sounds like the 80's tune, \\"Tender love\\" by the Force MD's.<br /><br />\\"Unthinkable (I'm ready)\\" reminds me of her song \\"Slow down\\". Maybe it's the grownup version of \\"Slow down\\" . . . \\"she's ready\\".<br /><br />\\"Love is my disease\\" is one of the best songs on this CD. It has an 80's soft rock feel with a reggae backdrop. Alicia's vocals are very soulful and wanting.<br /><br />\\"Like the sea\\" a nice r&b flavored tune. I love Alicia's vocals and the arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Put it in a love song\\" duet with Beyonce is a dance hit if released. Technically, it is an average song with big tribal beats and vocal clich&eacute;s like. . . \\"say you want me, then text it on my cell phone\\".<br /><br />\\"This Bed\\" is a great song.

B002SJIO5E|3.0|I quit reviewing for a reason, so I'm reluctant to do this.  So take it for what it's worth - absolutely nothing (just like all subjective commentaries on film.)<br /><br />At what point does originality become more important than actual entertainment.  District 9 is a movie made for industry types, critics, burgeoning film-makers, etc. more than the majority looking for a fun 2 hour escape.  So its critical success is understandable.  But, it's commercial success is less clear.  I wonder if the film would have lured as many people into theaters if not for Peter Jacksons name being attached to what appeared to be a big-budget alien invasion.  The trailers do a great job of not giving too much away, unfortunately, they border on deceptive advertising.<br /><br />Take some annoying, self-promoting, superficial corporate type that might earn 2 minutes of screentime in a movie like ID4 and make an entire movie surrounding his exploits.  That seems to be the gist of the story.  To be fair, District 9 is a little bigger than that.  It tosses in a cliched metaphor or two, hoping people won't notice how shallow the plot.  But, it plays like a group of producers made a bet at the end of their weekly card game whether or not they could capitalize on what amounts to a 2 hour newscast on a grand scale.  As a former movie-critic, I can appreciate the technical execution of the film itself.  But, as a more humble movie enthusiast, I found the documentary style of filmmaking, the detached storytelling, and the unsympathetic characters more annoying than clever.  Just because something is fresh or new doesn't make it worthy.  I could put peanut-butter on a hamburger, but who would want to eat it?  Does it taste better because some culinary \\"authority\\" who's become embitterd from constantly eating the best food, thinks it's fresh and exciting?<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely fantastic, though.  And it's good to see a more pseudo-intellectual type of film merit big budget effects.  But, in this case the story just didn't do it for me, nor the storytelling.  But that's just my arrogant opinion.  Please don't let it or any other sway you for or from the film.  If it's something you're interested in, watch it.  Watch ALL of it.  And decide for yourself.et effects.  But, in this case the story just didn't do it for me, nor the storytelling.  But that's just my arrogant opinion.

076532413X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I must say it kept me at the edge of  my seat for most of the time. Each separate story was engaging. When a book   deals with several protagonists sometimes one or more of the stories leaves  something to be desire and the reader is forced to skip ahead to the interesting  one. Not this one. The science behind it was solid, I checked most of the  theories and facts outlined in the story and the writer did not make any of it  up. If you love science, especially the fascinating field of physics and  astrophysics, this book is it. The enormous amount of explanations, especially  in the middle, did not bored me, in fact it forced me to learn more. This is  the way science-fiction writers should explain the concepts of science, thru  stories that are well written and characters that almost come alive. Great  work!!
B001EYU1VO|1.0|I'm writing this review after my button 2 fell off and my POV down stopped working...    This joystick is not good for flight sims because:    1. There is way too much slop in the handle. The adjustability of this joystick might be nice but the linkages from the top of the joystick to the base is way too loose so tiny movements in the stick don't actually move the X and Y sensors.    2. To make matter worse the force to value relationship of the X and Y is way too stiff and when you combine it with the slop in the handle and the light, plastic, small surface-area base it makes smooth movement around the origin on X and Y difficult. You have to like hold it down on your lap and counter weight all your X/Y movements. Also it's like the spring adds a force spike right around the origin so small movements are harder to make than large ones, which is totally the opposite of what you would want.    I have no idea why this thing has so many 3 and 4 star reviews.    I really want my money back.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|This movie is pure amazing now I'm not going to lie the theatrical version was a great movie but it didn't capture a lot of the important points the book made. But this ultimate cut was amazing. When they mean ultimate they mean it. I love the way the beautifully edited tales of the black freighter in the movie. The ultimate cut of the movie is worth the price already but they give you much more, they give you commentary with the directer and over 3hours of special features. And it comes with the motion comic that is a page by page of the comic book but its in motion and it has voice acting.
B0026P3G12|2.0|Poor song choice, terrible arrangements, hideous echo/reverb, miserable chorus, overbearing piano, guitar out of nowhere.  Why couldn't they just let Ms. Boyle sing?  She has the pipes for it; but I suppose the producers didn't think so and threw in everything but the kitchen sink (maybe the sink was there in the background) to doll the whole thing up.  Susan Boyle singing, that's what I want, not a lot of gimmicks.

0385504225|4.0|I was a bit nervous to read Dan Brown's new novel because I thoroughly enjoyed his last two so much and it would not have surprised me if this one was not as good. But to my delight, The Lost Symbol began with typical fast-paced mystery and intrigue which did not stop until the very end. I tore through this book at lightening speed.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is different from The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons in that it follows Robert Langdon as he scurries across Washington D.C. as opposed to countries in Europe. But it is the same in that symbology, mysticism and secret societies abound. There is a crazy evil genius as in the last two books and I will be interested to see who plays his part in the movie adaptation (because we all know a movie will be forthcoming). Essentially, The Lost Symbol has pretty much the same plot as Brown's other two books but I still couldn't put it down.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed reading this book a lot, but I am pretty sure this is the last time Dan Brown can write the same book with different characters and slightly different story lines and get away with it. I enjoy Brown's style of writing and the fast-paced excitement of the plots he creates, but I hope he can come up with something new next time.
B002GJU54E|4.0|When I read the reviews about monkeys and bodily functions, I did a bit of an eye roll. :-) But... it kind of worked in the end.     Intially I thought it would be too silly for words and I LOVE her work. I have every one of Janets books and read them all a couple of times a year - always hilarious. Anyway, I read this one with a bit of trepidation.     I found I actually loved the monkey - he was rather funny and quirky and quite interesting. Yes, missed Ranger lots - love Ranger too. And Morelli - but Ahhh... Ranger. Anyway - also was highly unsure about the Fire Farter bit and thought it was a bit unneccessary and stupid and peurile, until you got to the end and I thought - ah, I can see now how this works and ties together.     And let's face it, just about everything is fairly improbable but so so funny (as if the insurance company keep insuring Stephanie, but do we care.. no..... )and we are all looking for a bit of high energy escapism that makes us laugh out loud in this world. Sometimes I am just rolling around in fits of laughter and I must have read all her books about 30 times. But they still tickle me.     I think Janet Evanovich has delivered fairly well again. The monkey is quite clever. :-) Thanks.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|Based on the sixth book in J.K Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series, \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" first hit the big screen in 2009.     Orphaned as a baby and subsequently raised (in the loosest possible terms) by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, Harry's early years were thoroughly miserable. Although he had been told his parents had died in a car crash, they were actually murdered by an evil wizard called Voldemort. Harry, however, somehow survived this attack and Voldemort subsequently disappeared for many years. Harry learnt of his past when he was eleven, and has since been attending Hogwarts - a very prestigious school for training young witches and wizards. The years in between have provided him with some of the happiest moments of his life : he has made friends for the first time - including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - and he has become the Seeker on Gryffindor's Quidditch team. The school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, considered by many to be the greatest wizard of modern times, has become something of a role model to him. Unfortunately, it has also become apparent that Voldemort's disappearance was only temporary - and, while many in the wizarding world have tried to pretend otherwise, his return cannot now be ignored. Furthermore, Harry has now been identified as the `Chosen One' and is destined to battle with Voldemort again - with only one of the two surviving. Despite the enhanced security at Hogwarts, however, Harry can't feel entirely safe there. Professor Snape, the Potions teacher who has picked on Harry from the day he arrived, was a once noted Death Eater...and, despite Dumbledore's assurances, Harry has never trusted him. Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch-nemesis among the student body, is the son of another noted Death Eater...and Harry believes Draco is now following in his father's footsteps. As it turns out, Harry's suspicions may not be entirely groundless...    The film opens with Dumbledore surprising Harry wait a visit, towards the end of the summer holidays...and taking him onwards, to meet a former colleague called Professor Horace Slughorn. Dumbledore hopes he will return to the teaching staff - and has brought Harry along as `bait'. (He has a record of `collecting' talented young witches and wizards - and Dumbledore knows he wouldn't be able to resist Harry). Naturally, he caves in...though a return to Hogwarts would be a great relief to him. Voldemort - who also features in Slughorn's collection of notable past pupils - has desperately been trying to add him to the Death Eaters.     When he arrives back at Hogwarts, however, Harry's surprised to learn Slughorn is taking over as Potions teacher - with Snape finally taking over the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. The shuffle also means that Harry will be able to take both subjects - both are needed for him to become an Auror. (Snape had threatened to keep him out of the NEWT-level Potions class, for not achieving the top grade at OWL Level. Slughorn, on the other hand, is more than happy to accept him). Since he hadn't bought any books for the Potions course in Diagon Alley, Harry borrows an old copy of the textbook from the classroom's store. It puts Harry at an immediate advantage over his classmates, thanks to some very helpful notes made by its previous owner...someone who called himself the 'Half-Blood Prince'. Harry is also getting some additional 'classes' with Dumbledore - where he learns more about Voldemort's past. However, they're not very regular as Dumbledore seems to be spending a lot of time away from Hogwarts....and there is a little homework, that involves working closely with Slughorn.    Unsurprisingly, given the length of the book, not everything makes it into the film. While some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore are dropped, and there's no mention of Grimmauld Place, the changes and the omissions at the film's climax surprised me most of all...there were a couple of scenes there, I'd have thought, would have been a film-maker'sdream. Nevertheless, looking at the film in isolation - rather than comparing it to the book - I did find it very enjoyable. It was very dark and stylish, while Helena Bonham Carter was - once again - outstanding in her far-too-brief appearance as Bellatrix. (I wish something had been done to extend her screen-time. A bit more of Luna would've been welcomed too). Malfoy is no longer the strutting, preening bully, and clearly struggles with what's expected of him throughout the year. Overall, I enjoyed it - while the Potter diehards mightn't be too happy with it, I found it a fun way to pass a couple of hours.
B002JCSWUW|3.0|Whenever I see the name \\"Clint Eastwood\\" associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino.  Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation.  With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.<br /><br />Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule.  Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country.  He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way.  The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders.  Yet, unlike \\"Torino\\" or \\"Baby\\", the word I would use to describe this film is \\"understated\\".  Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach.  There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been.  Whether this was Eastwood trying to \\"follow the facts\\" as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed.  However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.nvictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.

0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol is, in my opinion, very much like Dan Brown's two previous books featuring the character of Robert Langdon. I could spew out a string of complaints about Brown's views as well as his writing quirks; however, I still find myself devouring everything he has published. Count on this book to be frustrating at points but always engrossing.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I was a huge fan of Firefly and when the studio cancelled it I was totally bummed. Serenity was a great follow-up and gave me another chance to watch this talented comedian on the screen. Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog was awesome as well.<br /><br />When I found out Fillion was going to star in Castle I had to watch it. Unfortunately, I missed much of the season. Thank God for Hulu - they had several episodes still available to watch. I was hooked!<br /><br />I love who dunnit's with quirky consultants (like Psych, which is another awesome show!) Castle being an author was a great twist. And no this is not like Murder She Wrote. This is fun and funny. The character's banter and Castle's family interactions make the show work.<br /><br />This is a great DVD set and I highly recommend it!
B0000041Z5|5.0|Solti recorded these works at Medinah Temple, Chicago, in 1978 and 1979, while Orchestra Hall was undergoing the first of several long-needed acoustical makeovers. Reiner, Solti's exacting predecessor, recorded many seminal performances there after engineers assured him that Medinah's acoustics exceeded those of Orchestra Hall as it then existed. The building, dating to 1912, still stands on the Near North Side of Chicago, having been granted landmark status by the city on June 27, 2001. The sound of all 4 CDs is rich and warm, somewhat comparable to that of Jesus Christus-Kirke in Berlin, a venue chosen by von Karajan for its acoustical majesty. Overrall, sonic perfection from a world-class orchestra.

B002RSDW80|1.0|There are over 137 reviews of this movie.  That means that there are over 137 people who wasted their time and money over this movie. Dull, boring, time waster, why?, waste of talent, shall I go on?  These are some of the thoughts I had as I watched this movie. So as not to waste your time, let me list the problems:  1.  Julia's part of the movie is about her translating a French cook book into English and getting it published.  That is it!  Forget about that she worked for the OSS during WW II in China and met her husband.  Forget about that she wanted children but couldn't.  Forget about her sister and her fammily life.  Forget about her husband and the  Macarty investigation.  All of these were shown in the movie and could have been left out because they don't do anything to move the story along.  They would have made a better movie, but no.  2.Julia is a failed writer, has a boring job, lives in a cramped apartment, and has a \\"saint\\" or \\"wimp\\" of a husband.  Her story is about her cooking every recipe in Julia's French cook book in 365 days and blogging about it.  Thrilling!!!???  Who cares?  That is the point, there is no reason to care about her or anyone else in this movie.  I am a gourmet cook and there is one thing I do know and that is: cooking Julia Child's recipes correctly is expensive!  Where does Julie get the money to do all of this?  3.  The acting is one note for both.  Streep has the accent and mannerisms down but no depth of character.  Adams has.... I don't know what but I didn't care.  4.There was no why in this movie.  Why do I want to know about these people? Why do I care about French cooking? Why do I care about Julie's blog?  Why?  5. Why did the writer/director mention the fact that Julia Child hated Julie Powell's blog and not explain it?  6. The Saturday Night Live skit showing the actor making fun of Child by cutting off his thumb under cuts the revernce that Julie had for Child.  7. Julile Powell's husband comes off as a \\"wimp\\" with no back bone and no personality.  Julia Child's husband comes across as supportive and charming, that is because of Tucci, who is a great actor.  8.  The writng is the bad guy in this and the director wrote it so she is at fault.  At 123 minutes there are 30 minutes that could have been cut out.  That would not have saved this movie but it would have made this review shorter.  9. A P.S. if the gossip about Powell and what happened to her is true then there would have been a good \\"trashy\\" movie.  Look up what happen to her life and you will see.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|My son gifted me this for Christmas and honestly, it would have remained at the bottom of my 'next to play' pile for a while.  Instead he urged us to it down with the big screen and go for it.    TREMENDOUS movie. The story line is GREAT and so far beyond normal alien 'stuff'.  Three minutes into the movie I was hooked and remained strongly so for the rest of it.    Just give it a shot, I do believe you'll be as taken with it as I was.

And as the \\"affected\\" person of the pair, why then wouldn't anyone, male or female, change places and sleep on the \\"safe\\" side of the bed??

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I love this new disc from Alicia Keys.  Every thing that Alicia puts out sounds fresh and unique. My favorite track is \\"Empire State Of Mind\\". This is a song about how New York can be a source of inspiration.  My other favorite track is \\"Wait Till You See My Smile\\". This song makes me feel good, and it has a great beat. \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" is a beautiful cut. \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" is a upbeat duet with Beyonce. \\"This Bed\\" is a good dance cut.  I like this song very much. \\"Distance And Time\\" is a pretty song.  It is a romantic song. \\"Unthinkable\\" is a smooth and probably the most sensual track on the album.  Alicia shines on the  piano on the song \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\".  \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" is an uplifting song.  Alicia wears her heart on her sleeve on the song \\"Love Is A Disease\\".  There is a honesty in her voice that makes her sound real.  \\"Like The Sea\\" is another soulful gem of a song here.  The Element Of Freedom is an excellent album.

B000XA5K48|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen. From start to finish it was totally rediculous. The humor was poor, the action was really poor and so far fetched.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|Sorry about the slightly blue pun of my review title, but I couldn't help myself - saw this band perform on Letterman & had to pick up the album.  Glad I did!!  Great band, very fun album.  Florence (the singer & snare drum basher) has got kind of a Kate Bush-ian, Siouxsie Sioux thing going on, and it totally works.  Plus, her band (The Machine, I guess?) can really play.  This is the best of the genre that my wife and I call \\"Gifted Kids Class\\" (i.e. imagine if the kids in the \\"Gifted Class\\" in grade school formed a band and released an album; think Beck).  If you're an old-school fan of that immediate post-punky-type rock (P.I.L, Siouxsie and the Banshees, etc.), as well as new-school garage rock, you'll love this!
B0026P3G12|5.0|A delightful album from 2009's musical surprise. Miss Boyle is gifted with a wonderful and heavenly voice. I wish her continued success. Her humility is a virtue, her voice angelic. Buy this album and enjoy it for years to come!

B000MV8AE0|5.0|A fine dvd displaying part of Beethoven's challenging life. Great acting, you'll like this film if you enjoy a fine story and classic music. I highly recommend it and enjoyed watching Ed Harris' fine performance as Beethoven. You'll also enjoy German actress Diane Kruger's performance, and beauty, as well. Both provided fine flawless acting- a real tribute too them, and the director & producer.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|My 17 year old son who plays guitar in a seriously hard driving almost metal band has been raving about 'Band of Horses' for a couple years.  Given the shows we've seen together.... Metallica, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Kiss, Alter Bridge,  Roger Waters, etc., I assumed this would be another cranking rock band.  He asked for tickets to see Band of Horses on New Year's Eve in Atlanta and I figured if I was going to see these guys he should burn me a copy of their tunes so I could get a listen before we went.  Imagine my surprise when I heard this.  Of course he loves 'Explosions In The Sky' as well, so maybe his taste is a lot more varied than I give him credit for......    After several listens to both albums, they're kind of growing on me.  Maybe it's me, but I hear some Neil Young influence in some of the songs.  And that's not a bad thing.  Not that  every track is dynamite, a couple of them I just skip over 'cause I don't like them.  But then even some of my all time favorite artists lay some stinkers down that aren't worth listening to.  This is just some nice pleasant sounding mellow rock that you can either really get into or just have it on in the background.  At this point, I've listened to the disc in the car about three times over the last couple days.  I don't have any liner notes, so I don't know the song titles.  Yet.  Again, I don't think it's great or amazing.  But it's not bad and easy to listen to.    I've seen a couple comments about how this sounds like 'My Morning Jacket'.  I'm sure there were people whining about how 'My Morning Jacket' sounded like someone else before that.  It's hard these days to find any band that doesn't at least somewhat remeind you of someone else.

B00005JLIU|4.0|Loosely based on an earlier English musical titled CHRYSANTHEMUM, the 1967 THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE was originally envisioned as a star-making comedy vehicle for Mary Tyler Moore, who was then fresh from television success via THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW; by the time the cameras rolled, however, it had evolved into a big-budget musical with Julie Andrews as star and Moore in a strong but less showy supporting role. Featuring a handful of new songs, a handful of old songs, and considerable production razzle-dazzle, it was a popular movie ticket--although not really the great hit everyone connected with the project hoped it would be.<br /><br />The film is a spoof of 1920s silent movie melodrama. Anxious to be entirely up-to-date, Millie (Julie Andrews) has come to New York with the express purpose of wearing short skirts, finding a job, and marrying the boss. She soon meets Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore), who is very much an old fashioned girl in curls, and the two take rooms in a hotel for young women run by Mrs. Meers (the legendary Beatrice Lillie)--a strangely occidental asian \\"Dragon Lady\\" who is involved in \\"white slavery\\" and sets sights on Miss Dorothy as her next victim. Along the way Millie also meets charming salesboy Jimmy (James Fox), who she won't marry because because he is poor; lands a job for rich and handsome Trevor (John Gavin), who won't marry her because he prefers the old fashioned style of Miss Dorothy; and truly peculiar widowed socialite Muzzy (Carol Channing) who seems to turn up in the oddest places at the oddest times. Needless to say, all the characters collide in musical numbers and comic set pieces and, true to its silent movie style, the wicked are punished and the good rewarded when the final credits unreel.<br /><br />The film has several flaws, and chief among them is its length: three hours is simply too much time for the sprightly story to carry, and it is easy to pick out scenes which, although well-done, lengthen the film to no particular point. The score is also rather weak: although the title song is a pleaser, and such 1920s pieces as \\"Poor Butterfly\\" and \\"Jazz Baby\\" are well performed, few of the musical numbers seem to have much to do with anything in particular. Fortunately, though, the cast carries everything off. Julie Andrews turns in a truly great comic performance as the determinedly brash Millie with Mary Tyler Moore equally memorable as the goody-goody Miss Dorothy--and while both Fox and Gavin are more solid than sharp, both Carol Channing and Beatrice Lillie (who was beginning to show warning signs of Alzheimer's disease during the shoot) are drop-dead spectacular in their supporting roles. The costumes, choreography, set pieces are tremendous fun, and comic set pieces (such as the \\"musical\\" elevator) abound.<br /><br />In recent years MILLIE has been accused of racism in its portrayal of Asian stereotypes: the wicked Mrs. Meers and her henchmen, kidnapping beautiful white virgins into white slavery to satisfy the inhuman lusts of those nasty Chinese! But those who make the accusation have missed the point by a mile; such stereotypes were commonplace in the 1920s silent movie melodramas MILLIE spoofs, and the script is actually poking fun at such old-fashioned movie notions by playing them as silly nonsense. Indeed, \\"silly nonsense\\" is a good way to describe THOROUGH MODERN MILLIE: it is indeed silly nonsense that is extremely well performed and, in spite of several glaring flaws, remarkably entertaining.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with a friend of mine. I'm the type of person that watches a movie for what it is, without any expectations. My friend, however, was bred on the gore flicks of the last few years, so she expects blood, gore, and millions of dollars worth of special effects to make a movie scary. So her expectations were for a high dollar Hollywood creation, while I went into the theater, sat down, and let the movie come; special effects or not. I found the movie scary, she did not.    There lies the problem. If you're expecting all this cgi and manufacturing, you'll be disappointed at a great movie. My advice to you: Watch the movie with NO expectations. Just watch it, and get into what's going on. It helps if you've experienced a haunting yourself to make this movie scarier. If you haven't, trust me: They did their homework on how a haunting goes for this movie.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|When two different genres of music collide, the results can go either way. In this case Emmylou Harris, whose sweet comforting voice has long been a favorite of mine and Mark Knopfler, whom I remember fondly from that mostly terrible decade of music, the 1980's, have collided and this wonderful music is the result. Both have soft, soothing voices which harmonize beautifully in this collection of sentimental songs with a few upbeat, catchy tunes thrown in for good measure. My personal favorites are Beachcombing; Love and Happiness; Belle Starr; and, If This Is Goodbye, though there is not a bad song to be found. Very relaxing and even inspirational. I have no idea why the negative reviewers found the whole thing depressing. I'll be first in line when and if these two put together another collection.

B0026P3G12|1.0|I couldn't wait to open this CD on Christmas morning. Much to my dismay, the Susan Boyle that I heard on Youtube is absent on this recording. Where's the passion? Where's the power? Simon Cowell referred to Susan as a \\"tiger.\\"  Someone has this tiger by the tail and has pulled her into the zone of mediocrity. On several of the tracks she sounds like Bernadette Peters (with a mild case of laryngitis).  I love Bernadatte, but what this world does not need is another Bernadette Peters.
B002UJIY70|5.0|I know a lot of people are critical of this movie, but given it's genre, does anyone offer up a better one? Thrillers of this type are usually awful not only in the acting but the plot as well. Both were superb here. I am a huge fan of Milla, and she was the only reason I watched this movie, but not by any means the only thing that made this movie great. Timothy Olyphant takes on what is certainly, to-date, his best acting role yet. I liked Die Hard and Hitman, but he wasn't exactly outstanding as an actor in either of those movies, they were just entertaining. He really shows that he is capable of great acting if given the proper vehicle. The only thing that was hard for me was getting used to Steve Zahn not only as a grown up, but without a raggedy beard. Once I got past that I really got immersed in the story. Beautiful camera work and art direction accompanied a solid plot and superb acting. I would highly recommend anyone who is a fan of thrillers or just good movies in general at least rent this movie to see for yourself. Definitely worth watching.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Horror has become a very diluted genre these days. And as far as quality goes, a very poor one. So if you thought Saw XXII and Friday the 13th remake were actually good movies, leave this review now because I will insult you greatly. Anyway I jumped at the chance to drive an hour to see this little film on limited release and I LOVED it. It is a good film. Let me say that again to all the one star reviewers, it IS a good film. But I will admit it is different from what all the kiddies consider horror these days. There are no sorority cheerleaders killed in the opening 5 minutes, there is no (onscreen) sex. The movie starts slow to build the suspense, something that most filmmakers forget they have to do, but believe me it kicks into gear.     This film leaves many questions unanswered, but contrary to the title it is not a film about a \\"ghost\\". It is a film about a couple who is being haunted. The director and actors do a very good job trying to make you care about Kate and Micah (the couple) so that the final act hits you like a ton of bricks. Wait, caring about characters in a horror movie? What witchcraft is this? That being said of course this movie isn't perfect, but with a budget of $15,000 this movie succeeded in doing something that $30 million dollar movies couldn't. Truly scare me.    If you're tired with studios remaking every movie known to man..get this movie.    (On a DVD side of things this thing is pretty bare bones and unfortunately only includes 2 of the 3 endings to the film, neglecting to include the early original release ending. But it does it's job, just wish we could have gotten some special features...)
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I never realized how much of a fan I was of Alicia Keys until I wrote this review.  I didn't even realize I had all her albums.  I must go through the music to fast.  What I love about this album..is that it is plain Alicia Keys...what a talent to her original beautiful voice, lyrics (often emprowering to women not degrading them), and this is just her.  Maybe the content of the album is alittle redundent, but the beautiful voice and paino style is all hers.  I do find there isn't anything much different on this album, but a few of these songs are gems.  Love is Blind, If you Love Me Put it In a Love Song, and Empire State of Mind are already favorites of mind.  My seven year old can't stop singing If you love me put it in a love song.  The drums in that song are to sweet, and a sure dance hit.  Her voice in Love is Blind is so beautifully different that it almost doesn't sound like her.   I used to love Prince and sometimes her album has alittle Shelia E. feel to it for me.  I wonder if she was a big fan of Prince? Doesn't matter  I do like this album...not sure it is my favorite, but so far it has been on repeat!!! I can't wait for a greatest hits album...cool!!

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|First, let's focus on the most important. The flash has a lot of features, but nothing, let me repeat, nothing is more important than the raw power it can produce. If you were to ask a single question about a flash - ask about the guide number. The higher it is, the more options you have. You can reach objects far away, can bounce flash off the walls, put some filters - a lot of things you just can't do at all if your flash is not powerful enough. So if you look at the Nikon line, the SB-900 has this advantage.<br /><br />Second, if you look that the DSLR bodies, there is a lot of progress there and in a couple years you can get a much better body for the same price. The lenses and flashes on the other side are not changing that much and hold value over many years. So if you have a choice it's a good idea to get the best lense and flash you can afford so they can last forever and upgrade the cheaper bodies time to time.<br /><br />So these are two big reasons to buy SB-900.<br /><br />Now let's think why would you not buy this flash.<br /><br />If you read the reviews below, there is a lot of arguing about which batteries to use and the thermal shut off. You know, yes, they all have their points but in most of the real life situations all those concerns a way beyond reasonable.<br /><br />What else is not good about this flash? Well, the noise. If you have a zoom lense, every time you zoom in or out, the flash will adjust the mirrors to provide good coverage and that's causing some noise. It's ok outdoors or at a party, but if you try to take pictures at a concert, that could be distracting. (Yes, you can lock the mirrors in a wide position and give plenty of raw power you should get by without moving those mirrors in most case)<br /><br />Well, the menu and the controls could be easier to operate but that's not a deal breaker. And, of course, the price. It's quite expensive.<br /><br />So overall, this is really an amazing flash. Because it's so powerful, it can light up a huge areas or using filters or bouncing it can create some very nice lighting effects which you just can't do with a smaller flash, so if you can afford it - it's not a bad flash at all.n create some very nice lighting effects which you just can't do with a smaller flash, so if you can afford it - it's not a bad flash at all.

B001RNI34E|2.0|I really like Sophie Hannah's third book, The Wrong Mother, so I was looking forward to reading this one (her first) and was sorely disappointed.  This book was so disappointing that it made me wonder if I should rethink how much I liked The Wrong Mother.<br /><br />Hannah alternates chapters between first-person narrative of the protagonist and third-person narrative of the cops.  In The Wrong Mother this works really well, but in this book it feels too much like a device (which, of course, it is in both books).  In thinking through this I believe the heart of the problem here is in the rather poorly cobbled together characterizations; they just don't seem substantial or even internally consistent and this makes their actions ultimately unbelievable and mildly bland and predictable in a Wonder Bread and Miracle Whip kind of way.  There is a terrible waste of a really interesting premise here and an even more terrible waste of some good writing that's buried in here along with all the clumsiness.<br /><br />I'm reading Hannah's second book and will decide how I feel about her then, but at this point I'm feeling dubious and sort of jipped.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|First and foremost, the CGI in this movie is very well done and will no doubt win Oscars for those who created it. To be honest, I actually expected a little better after hearing all the buzz about this film's production costs and the technology that was going into it, but the CGI is certainly well done. That said, I wouldn't say this film surpasses other CGI-fests like the most recent \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.     I paid an extra $3.50 per ticket to view this in 3D in the theater. I'm sorry to report that the new 3D technology isn't all it's hyped to be. On the plus side, this is the best 3D I've ever seen. By that, I mean it's not the blurry, nausea-inducing mess that 3D films using older technology were. On the negative side, I still developed a bit of a headache from watching this, and another adult and a twelve-year-old I was with did too. For the record, a message played at the start of the film said that the projector and screen were installed specifically for this type of 3D film, so it was not a problem of substandard equipment. The bigger turn-off for me was that the 3D is really not an enhancement to the film, it's a detracting factor. As improved as it may be, it still doesn't look like reality. It does give a greater sense of depth, just like older 3D films did, but there's still that gimmicky, hyper-reality look to it that just doesn't convince and actually detracts from your ability to get absorbed in the story. Unfortunately, we'll probably be fed a steady stream of 3D films from Hollywood from now on, following \\"Avatar's\\" success at the box office. This will be the last 3D film I pay to see.    The story has some interesting elements, but much of the basic plot was blatantly lifted from much earlier films like \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and \\"The Last Samurai\\": Military man lives among less advanced, indigenous group--learns their culture and language astonishingly fast--falls for their hottest woman--is converted to their way of life--and lastly joins them ina battle against his own kind. The stag-hunt scene from \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" is included here, and some of the most intriguing aspects of the forest bear a strong resemblance to \\"Princess Mononoke\\" (one of the best anime films ever made).  \\"Avatar\\" is fairly predictable, and there are no real plot twists or surprises along the way. Even many of the monsters portrayed have obvious counterparts in the real world (horses, rhinos, jackals, jellyfish). I might have become bored at times had it not been for the visual goodies. Aside from the interesting avatar concept--which could even be called a ripoff of \\"The Matrix\\"--there really is very little that feels new in this film outside the realm of the excellent visual effects. I've deducted one star from my rating for what, at best, is a lack of originality in the story and, at worst, plagiarism.     The saving grace here is the CGI, which, as I said earlier, was very well done. The film also has a good cast.  I was especially impressed with Stephen Lang, who does a fine job playing the colonel.  He has a sort of Ed Harris toughness while being a new face for me.    \\"Avatar\\" is definitely worth seeing for the impressive CGI effects, but if you've seen \\"Dances with Wolves\\" or \\"The Last Samurai,\\" don't expect a novel storyline. Best just to sit back and enjoy the visual ride.  On that level, at least, it does deliver.
B002WTOXUK|2.0|The movie is very unusual which you may like. I didn't like it. It started in a slow documentary style and continued in that style off and on. It was a gritty kind of sci fi futuristic movie. I thought that it was boring and uninteresting.
B001HN69AO|4.0|\\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" is about as creative as the title suggests, a fable in which the imagination is not merely an escape from reality; it's the very fabric of existence, and as such, how we choose to exist ultimately determines whether or not we're slated for salvation. Director Terry Gilliam considers this an autobiographical film, which I guess is right since it's about a wizened storyteller hindered by a world in which story has been reduced to cheap thrills. Gilliam has a following, no question, but the God's honest truth is that most audiences these days would rather have their brains deadened with assaultive spectacles like \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\" or \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.\\" And studios are happy to produce them because they make money. Does no one want to be told a STORY anymore?    What makes \\"Imaginarium\\" so refreshing is not so much that it's a cornucopia of visual delights, even though it is, but that the visuals are utilized in a reliable Faustian plot with engaging characters. At the head of the team is Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), the 1,000-year-old head of an old-time theater troupe travelling across London. Along with his teenage daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), his illusionist, Anton (Andrew Garfield), and his feisty dwarf sidekick, Percy (Verne Troyer), Parnassus offers audiences a chance to step through a special mirror and watch as their imaginations are vividly brought to life. Is there a catch? Let's just say that Parnassus and the Devil - here named Mr. Nick (Tom Waits), an oily trickster who's never seen without a bowler hat and a cigarette holder clamped between his teeth - made a deal a long, long ago, and it's now time to pay up.    Before long, the troupe stumbles upon a man named Tony (the late Heath Ledger), who they save from dying a horrible death under a bridge. He awakens the next morning claiming to have no memory of who he is or what he had been doing, although we quickly suspect heknows a lot more than he lets on. While not particularly liked by anyone except Valentina, Tony uses both modern aesthetic sensibilities and his own mysterious charm to attract audiences to the Imaginarium, bringing in money and food for the rest of the troupe. It's all well and good, but the question remains: Who is this man? We have no real idea where he came from, and we certainly don't know where he's going. All we do know is that, for most of the film, he seems to be hiding from something. Or someone.    Isn't it strange, how a negative can be turned into a positive? Ledger had finished only one-third of \\"Imaginarium\\" before his death in January of 2008, leaving Gilliam with the monumental task of finding some way to complete the film. The solution: Cast Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell to play physically transformed versions of Tony, who appear only after he steps through the mirror and into the land of imagination. For an idea that had the potential to go spectacularly wrong, it ended up being one of the film's greatest strengths. This is not only because of Depp, Law, and Farrell, who are great talents and capable of delivering a Ledger-like performance, but also because it's an excellent display of creativity on Gilliam's part. He truly is like Doctor Parnassus, sustaining his own universe by constantly telling stories.    The visuals are an experience unto themselves, as they tend to be in a Terry Gilliam film. Every scene taking place in the realm of imagination is a beautifully realized dreamscape, where fantasy freely shifts back and forth between childish and whimsical to foreign and frightening. Shimmering waters cast perfect reflections. Cartoonish balloons float through the air. Landscapes rise and fall dramatically, with a towering cliff on one end and a flat desert on the other. These scenes alone would have made a strong case for releasing the film in 3-D; watching them is like wandering into a surrealist painting, with textures and patterns so strange and vivid that they practically beg for you to reach out and touch them.    Some, I suspect, will be more taken with the visuals than with the plot, which, I admit, does take some time to sort through. Others may only want the opportunity to see Heath Ledger one last time, and never mind the fact that his costars were just as memorable. What I personally got from \\"Imaginarium\\" above all else was the sense that I was actually being TOLD something. Are there moments of conjecture, confusion, chaos, and absurdity? Yes to all of the above. But even at its most cerebral, there's always the sense that it's working its way towards a goal, that it wants to be something greater than an astounding visual feast (this definitely doesn't include homage to his Monty Python days - a chorus line of policemen wearing skirts and hosiery). After a summer of repetitive action and nonstop special effects, \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" comes along and reminds us that imagination is, in fact, a good thing.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Loved the CD, but I wish there were more unique songs like \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"You'll see\\".  It still is a super CD.  She is phenominal.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|The contents are great.  I'd give it a 5 stars if it were the DVD version.    However, I am quite disappointed by the Blu-Ray HD picture quality.  The picture has a grainy mask over everything. Hence, I took off couple of stars for this blu-ray review.    The picture quality is quite inferior when compared to Baraka. I know my TV has no problem because Baraka looks perfect.
B001U7FWM8|2.0|I was hoping, based on the reviews, for an album that rewarded my higher (smart) and lower (fun) sensibilities at the same time, much like the Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshismi Battles the Pink Robots\\" did.    This is a worthwhile album for those who are already fans of the band or are okay with the fact that this is not really as accessible an album as other reviewers have indicated.  Depending on the type of music listener you are, you'll either view this album as challenging/multi-layered/progressively-rewarding, or you'll see it as esoteric/noodling/purposefully obfuscating and difficult.  I'd fall mainly in the last camp.  I've given the album many repeat listens, and while I find this to be an admirable effort--creative, experimental, well-produced and thoughtful--it isn't a whole lot of fun...and I love Radiohead.  The constant exhaultation of the band's use of harmonizing, while interesting, doesn't move me as much as it does others.    The only track I feel bridges the gap between 'smart' and 'fun' is 'Two Weeks', which you'll especially love if you're a fan of Vampire Weekend's sound.  One great track does not make a great album however; the rest fails to move me.  If this is among the best of '09, it's been a pretty weak year.
B0017VG69U|5.0|This is the last set I needed for my collection. I was happy to be able to buy it individually since I already owned the rest. Every season is worth owning if you appreciate what they created in the original series in great stories, and characters. A great original.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|I just received my Blu-Ray version of \\"Let The Right One In\\" (which I ordered on 12/27/09) and it does not have the \\"theatrical\\" subtitles. I ordered it because several other reviewers had said they received the updated version. This is just a warning to the people looking for the correct version of the film on Blu-Ray.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I find it difficult to imagine that anyone couldn't be taken in by this refreshing bit of nostalgia from the very talented writer/director, Greg Mottola (Superbad).Honest and earnest performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Kristin Stewart help to transcend this from just another coming-of-age story. The craziness is wonderfully enhanced by Bill Hader, Kristin Wiig, Ryan Reynolds, and, especially, Martin Starr as the most colorful of Jesse's new acquaintances. \\"Adventureland\\" made many Top 10 lists this year, but the only actual award recognition I'm aware of is an Indie Spirit nomination for Mr. Mottola's very clever screenplay. I enjoyed it VERY much. Coming-of-age has rarely been displayed in such a clever and original way (yes, I've seen \\"Breaking Away\\" and \\"American Graffiti\\").

B000VECAC6|5.0|Ten years ago, I dropped $40 on the fancy, deluxe Criterion DVD of Life of Brian and loved it. The multiple commentary tracks and bonus features were great, and the picture was definitely an upgrade from my VHS copy. Several years later, I was disappointed to see that Criterion didn't assume the task of releasing Life of Brian on Blu-ray, leaving it to Sony instead. Well, having finally jumped on the Blu-ray bandwagon, I decided to pick up the new disc. All I can say is wow. This completely blows the Criterion DVD out of the water. This is a crystal clear, spotless transfer whereas the Criterion version had plenty of scratches, specks, and whatnot on the film. I had no idea this movie could look this good. Most of the bonus features have been carried over, and there is a new retrospective featurette with interviews of all the living Pythons, so parting ways with my old DVD was a piece of cake. To make it even better, the Blu-ray retails for half the price of the Criterion DVD, so if you are at all reluctant to double-dip on this one, I highly suggest going for it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have owned this DVD for over a year now and it is my favorite workout DVD of all time.  It seems that most people I know also own it - I am always meeting people from all walks of life that own this DVD.  It reminds me of the Jane Fonda craze of the early 80s!  Why is it my favorite workout DVD of all time, among all that I have owned over the past decade?  That's why I'm here to write this review.<br /><br />Jillian Michaels has always been an inspiration to me.  She is a strong, tough, and beautiful woman and is about my same age.  So, when I heard she had a DVD, I bought it.<br /><br />There are three 20-minute workouts on the DVD, intended to be done 10 times at each level.  By the third workout, you are doing mountain climbers and plank!  I found that Level III wasn't significantly more difficult than Level I, so some users may wish to alternate the workouts rather than proceed sequentially.  Supposedly you would be \\"shredded\\" if you did all those workouts in a month.  How I admire anyone that can actually do 30 workouts in 30 days!  When I was kid-less, I would be doing other types of workouts (dance rehearsals, long walks, other vids) - and now I just can't find the time every day!  However, I am still trying to do 10 of each workouts even if I can't make it every day.  Currently I am up to #9.  It's hard work!  If you keep at it, you will find yourself getting stronger and your form improving.<br /><br />The theory is that you do 3 minutes of strength, 2 of high-intensity cardio and 1 of abs.  In the strength portion, you alternate between a heavy-duty single-muscle strength move and a move that combines upper & lower body.  In the cardio portion, there are usually 2 cardio moves, like jumping jacks and jump rope and you alternate every 30 seconds.  My favorite part of course is abs - you get to lie on the floor and do some variety of crunches.  It keeps your interest with the variety, doesn't wear any particular part out too much, and you know that if you don't like it, it will be over soon at least.<br /><br />Jillian's pitter patter is motivating.  She tells you that you have to work out  hard to get results, that you can do it if some of the people she trains on Biggest Loser can do it, and that you're going to get results if you keep at it.  She also has  Anita demonstrating an easier version and Nathalie doing a harder version, so that within one workout, you can adjust to your abilities.<br /><br />The workout is great for anyone, but it's particularly great for moms.  I used this DVD frequently before I was a mom, stopped while I was pregnant (too high impact), and started again once I was given the go-ahead to exercise.  The 20 minute workouts are perfect to fit in during your child's naps.  It can still be difficult to find that 20 minutes, after all, you still have to get your workout clothes on!  My only criticism is the LONG introduction at the beginning of the DVD that cannot be skipped.  Typically I turn on the DVD player and the Wii, do my Wii Fit Body Test, and by the time I'm done, the DVD is ready for me to choose a workout.l be over soon at least.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This album far surpasses my expectations from the youtube clip as that's all I had previously heard.  Susan has the voice of an angel, a gift straight from God.  Every note she sings is perfection and straight from her heart, every note from the musicians is matching in perfection.  Kudos to the producers of this album who must have put a lot of thought into what songs to choose for her and the musical arrangements.  I can put song #7 \\"Up To The Mountain\\" on repeat and listen to it all day long.  This is one of my alltime favorite CDs - I bought a second one for myself in case this one gives out, and have purchased several for gifts.   Now I'm anxiously awaiting a second release.  Way to to SUSAN!
1416572287|4.0|The title and Amazon's Product Description (which is merely the flyleaf material) are terribly misleading. Instead of \\"Physics\\" it should read \\"Quantum Mechanics\\". This is a book for those with a background in physics and math (and some grounding or heavy interest in quantum mechanics).<br /><br />While writing an \\"everyman\\" book on quantum mechanics would be a tough chore, we are led to believe that is exactly the job Orzel not only set out to do, but also actually accomplished. In fact, he didn't get there.<br /><br />As a long time reader of \\"popular\\" science, I looked forward to this book. I am always glad to see experts reduce their subjects to the understanding of the common man. I compare their results to those achieved by Isaac Asimov and Martin Gardner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Orzel did not approach either of them in simplification for the interested, but non-expert, reader. This is more a textbook-lite with the gimmick of his pet dog as Watson to his Holmes. The inclusion of the dog, while \\"cute\\", is little more than an excuse for interludes which end with telling the dog that she doesn't understand and here's more textbook material.<br /><br />I am disappointed. Based on my less than expert knowledge of the material - it was well described and useful as an introduction for a student. It is a helpful way for them to get acquainted with the subject. It falls way short of the mark set by the marketing ploy of title and description.<br /><br />My rating of four stars is based on five stars for the physics and two stars for the promise left unfulfilled of being for a wider audience (rounded up). Make your buying decision according to your need for this level of treatment of the subject.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|So many times the Recording Academy overlooks some of the 'best' albums when it comes time for Grammy nominations. Hopefully this time next year, the Academy won't overlook Muse's exceptional [[ASIN:B002GZQYMK The Resistance]], which makes my list as perhaps 2009's Best Rock albums and one of the best overall albums of the year.  It seems that rock in 2009 saw few outright shining albums, further accentuated by the rather bland Grammy nominations and lack of a clear front-runner. Muse's 'The Resistance', released in September outside of the Grammy eligibility period, may just be the true shining rock album. Having never purchased a Muse album before but hearing my friends rave of their greatness, I decided I would purchase 'The Resistance' given its exceptional reviews and the hype surrounding it within a plethora of magazines. I will say this, I wasn't disappointed one bit.  Exceptional.<br /><br />The album opens with the rousing \\"Uprising\\", a valedictory performance by all means.  The production is solid, the songwriting exceptional, and frontman's Matthew Bellamy's vocal performance is spot-on.  Captivating, epic, and alluring all in one, \\"Uprising\\" is definitely my favorite cut from 'The Resistance.' While \\"Uprising\\" is my favorite, \\"Resistance\\" proves no less captivating than \\"Uprising\\" as it is every bit as exciting and well conceived. With driving drums, touches of piano contrasting the guitars, and experimental timbres, \\"Resistance\\" is phenomenal.<br /><br />\\"Undisclosed Desires\\" possesses more of an alternative pop-feel than either \\"Uprising\\" or \\"Resistance\\", contrasting the 'heavier' nature of those tracks. It showcases the versatility of the group and their finesse. \\"United States Of Eurasia/Collateral Damage\\" reminisces one of something that Queen might have done in the 1970s.  Progressive, beautiful, and epic, \\"United States of Eurasia...\\" is another breathtaking performance from Muse featuring strings, middle eastern sounds, grand vocal harmonies, and a driving groove. Exceptional by all means, \\"United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage\\" is a stand-out (not to mention the use of classical composer/pianist Chopin at the end!!!).<br /><br />\\"Guiding Light\\" begins energetically with a driving groove, that erupts into an epic, high energy cut.  Inspirational, gargantuan, and chilling all in one, \\"Guiding Light\\" keeps up the momentum. \\"Unnatural Selection\\" opens with chilling pipe organ (who does that on a rock album?), leading into another 'sick' performance.  May I just say again, Grammy? \\"Unnatural Selection\\" proves to be 7 minutes of unrequited greatness. What musicianship Muse possesses.<br /><br />\\"MK Ultra\\" is solid, while \\"I Belong To You/Mon Caeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix\\" finds the band entangled in yet another great, lengthy, prog rock 'epic' - this time incorporating French! The album ends with a three-part 'symphony', \\"Exogenesis\\" (tracks 9 - 11), which is equally as epic, mysterious, beautiful, and intriguing as the entirety of the album. Essentially, 'The Resistance' proves to be an epic, lofty affair that is intellectual, yet counters it intellectual means with a grand enjoyability.  Easily one of the year's best albums, I'm sorry I waited so late to review it. 4 1/2 stars.ve.

0062511408|4.0|I've listened to the book in English (in the shape of an audiobook) and read it in Spanish. It was great in either language. The book is not too long, and it is told using simple language, meaning it will not take long to read the entire work which is good for a quick read or something you do not want to invest too much time on. The narrative is simple to understand as well as the ideas, this does not mean that the story is dull or dumb by any means. There are things that the reader can learn from the characters in the work, and the reader can sometimes identify with the character in the story.     Positive message/good story/not very long
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I'll admit, I had never purchased a Paramore album, prior to 2009's [[ASIN:B002FRNCG0 Brand New Eyes]]. After all the buzz in magazines and on the internet, and hearing \\"Decode\\" featured on [[ASIN:B001ED7C58 Twilight Soundtrack]], I thought 'Brand New Eyes' might be a tantalizing listen.  Indeed, it converted me to being a Paramore fan, particularly the insanely catchy, well-written first single \\"Ignorance\\", one of my favorite songs of 2009. The whole album proves enjoyable and affirms Paramore's status as one of today's cooler, and more unique bands.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Careful\\", and guitar-driven, mid-/up-tempo track that serves as a strong album opener. \\"Careful\\"  leaves a positive first impression on the listener, particularly the first time listener(myself). The songwriting is strong, the guitar-driven production top-notch, and lead singer Hayley Williams sings with great conviction and nuance.<br />\\"Ignorance\\", despite the greatness of \\"Careful\\" takes coveted honors of being valedictory and grand. The guitar riffs are killer, the overall scope perfect, and Williams's vocals are spot-on.  \\"Ignorance\\" is a five-star single if I've ever heard one.  Easily one of 2009's best tracks, period.<br /><br />\\"Playing God\\" continues an upswing for 'Eyes'. Sure, it doesn't enthrall as much as \\"Ignorance\\", but it continues a streak of strong songwriting, vocal performance, and great sounding music. \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\" contrasts the slightly tamer sound of \\"Playing God\\" by resurrecting a more driving sound.  \\"Brick\\" instantly proves to be exciting and captivating in sound, with another infectious, inescapable hook.<br /><br />\\"Turn It Off\\" is satisfying, keeping an 'air' of consistency about 'Brand New Eyes'. The break-down section is well executed leading into a searing powerhouse chorus with a huge 'wall' of guitar sound.  \\"The Only Exception\\" opens with lovely acoustic guitars, contrasting the heavier guitar sounds that generally dominate 'Brand New Eyes'. Hayley Williams sounds incredible singing more sensitively here, showing off her versatility. Honestly, \\"The Only Exception\\" turns out to be one of my favorites, second only to \\"Ignorance\\".<br /><br />Contrasting the softer intro of \\"The Only Exception\\" (this album seems to be one of contradictions and contrasts!), \\"Feeling Sorry\\" barrels right into the driving, angst-filled guitars that characterize Paramore.  The band does change the scope of the sound here with alteration of the syncopation, which is a welcome innovation.  Again, there is little to quibble about \\"Feeling Sorry\\". The refrain is definitely strong and proves to be one of the strongest of the entire album.  \\"Looking Up\\" continues Paramore's rhythmic endeavors, and finds the band convincingly singing catchy pop-punk/pop-rock. Something about the enthusiastic sounds makes the listener equally enthusiastic!<br /><br />\\"Where The Lines Overlap\\" has somewhat of a retro, 1960s rock feel, at least a first. It reminds me of the 'garage' sound dominating that era. Not revolutionary, \\"Where The Lines Overlap\\" settles for being a solid listen. \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" again finds the band using acoustic guitars as opposed to the driving electric guitars that have dominated. Again, the use of contrasts is an intelligent move. The album closes with \\"All I Wanted\\", a grand cut that finds Williams stretching her vocal range.<br /><br />In a year where rock stand-outs were far and few between (save for a few acts/albums), Paramore's 'Brand New Eyes' easily stood out in an elite group. 4 stars.incredible singing more sensitively here, showing off her versatility.

B00006GFAB|5.0|CD was in great condition, as advertised.  Delivery could have been quicker but it was worth waiting for!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Kinsella is one of my favorite authors, and when I heard that this was a \\"ghost\\" story, I was a little skeptical.  However, I found it impossible to put down.  It was a sweet story (with yes, the trademark over-the-top scenarios that Kinsella is famous for but still pulls off somehow) that had a sincere heart to it.  I cried at the end, which I never do, and I don't know if it was because of the sweet nature of the story or the fact that I didn't want it to be over.  Sadie was a great character and really came to life for me.  Please don't ever stop writing, Kinsella!
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Got mine today and I'm loving the Blu Ray!  Hard to believe that Batman is 20 years old.  The quality is amazing and exceeded my expectations based on reviews of the Blu Ray versions I've read on other sites.

B001E45XT4|4.0|After a month with this headset I'd to say that it was a good purchase, I only have 1 complain:<br />- After a while your ears WILL get hot, this because of the materials the headphones were built, but is not that bad, is not that they become SO hot that you have to take them off, not at all.<br /><br />Good price, solid performance, go for it.
B001F12J48|1.0|My wife and I were delighted to see POLAR EXPRESS in IMAX and 3D in the theater.  The true life-like colors and full 3-D effects were truly amazing.  This warm-hearted, delightful family movie was instantly our favorite Christmas movie and all-time family favorite.  We waited an extra year for the home version of POLAR EXPRESS 3D to be available in DVD format.  Blockbuster got the movie in stock in time for my wife to purchase it for my Christmas gift.  We opened it up on Christmas evening, expecting to get the same warm feelings as we did at the theater.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT when we turned it on, followed all the instructions and tried to look at it through the 50s CHEAPO-STYLE CARDBOARD, RED & BLUE glasses.  BLURRED IMAGES, RED & BLUE STREAKS, FADED OUT COLORS, MULTIPLE FACES AND ARMS convinced us that this was a BAD PURCHASE!!!!  The 3D effects were limited to snowflakes and a few distance shots.  But it gave you a BAD HEADACHE the first five minutes.  We tried to return it to Blockbuster for an exchange for the 2D version, or a refund.  We were told, \\"We don't exchange any movie after it was opened,\\" and \\"It's not our fault!\\" by the insensitive clerks.  We will NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM BLOCKBUSTER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002VXKYCS|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I had expected. Meryl Streep was a great choice for the role of Julia Child, as was Amy Adams as Julie Powell. In the 1950's, Julia begins to master the art of French cooking, and tries to get a cook-book published. In the year 2002, Julie Powell takes Julia's cook-book and begins to cook meals each day for a year, and writes about it in her blog. I highly recommend JULIE & JULIA!!!
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|I never got the chance to get this on VHS way back. Finally now own this on DVD.  It is so aweso<br />me, I could watch it over & over.<br /><br />Michael does a great job of acting.  Full of action, music and imagination.  I personally love \\"Come Together\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and \\"Speed Demon\\"
B001PR0YDA|4.0|I generally don't like Jim Carrey.  There have been several movies I've avoided because he was in it.  But I do like \\"Christmas Carol\\", and have several different versions in my very small DVD collection.    \\"Marley was dead: to begin with.\\"  The story is a classic.  Many of the lines in most versions, even 1960s TV cartoons, are lifted word for word from the text of Dickens' story.  We are NOT going to get surprises here.  We should know this going in as surely as we know \\"Marley was dead: to being with.\\"    The 3D effects in this version were a bit overdone in places.   The director seemed to forget the story in favor of the effects.    Having said that, this movie does an admirable job of presenting the tale.  I can't think of another version where ALL the ghosts are quite as frightening in their own way.  I don't buy many DVDs, but I will be getting this one when it comes out.
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you enjoy action, Olympian Gods, mystery, and good vs evil, well you're sure to enjoy this book.  Some have compared it to a hyped up Harry Potter, which is a compliment.  I recommend this series (I'm currently on the 2nd) to anyone who enjoys fantasy/fiction!  It's awesome!
B002HNA95E|5.0|I loved this collection of Madonna's and I highly recommend it to everyone who grew up with music star.  Excellent!!!
B000002ORU|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of material by The Who, and represents real value for money, whether you're a fan with passing interest in this band's music or, like me, obsessively addicted to their work. For the former, there's all the hits and an excellent booklet, for the latter, a range of interesting live tracks, out-takes, (and on disc four,) a selection of curious \\"Keith Moon mad but magic moments\\" as I like to refer to them. Each disc has it's own flavor and covers a different chronological phase in their career: disc one is the \\"my generation\\" era -- as bluesy as it is mod. Disc two sees the real emergence of Pete's songwriting, culminating in some \\"Tommy\\" stuff. Discs three and four are my favourite; hard rocking and experimental synthesisers in good measure!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I´ve been meaning to write a review since  i finished watching this show (the dvds). I´m a sci fi and fantasy fan and i live in a country that doesn´t give to much opportinities for this type of tv, movies or literature. the first thing  i have to say is that i have not read the books the series is based on, so i don´t know if it  is a worthy adaptation. what i know is that i really enjoyed whatching this series. I have read other reviews to the series that in general express what good experience it is but they taxed their rate of it because the first episodes are little slow and have some clitches. If you buy a car you expect it to have tires, maybe some day this won´t be the case but for now it be expected. I think the rythm  of the first episodes it´s key to fall in love the characters and their quest, allows you to inmerse in the story. I conceed there are a few  recurrent themes but i don´t think the series should be punished for it. second: the acting is really good, you believe what this characters feel  and how they evolved (even the evil ones); third: the photography and visual effects are really good (even movie like), fourth: many of the sopporting characters are interesting forcing you to care for their fate and fith: the whole season is history arc that it´s completed and resolved by the finale so you don´t have to bite your toes waiting for the second season, nevertheless you want more.
B00000IL67|5.0|Quite simply the finest collection of songs from the greatest showman to walk this planet. Every song is a telling story of how Alice has developed his creative persona over the last 30+ years. First 2cds in particular are just mindblowing. Rhino have certainly given value for money, with an incredible 81 tracks, including loads of rare stuff. A must for fans, and recommended for anyone even remotely interested in this hugely underrated performer.

0143038419|5.0|I decided to read the book after my girlfriend repeatedly recommended it. I'm certainly glad I did. What Elizabeth Gilbert provides is a candid memoir of a year of traveling after her divorce. Although commented on as a negative my many reviewers, I believe the details of her emotional struggle were a strength of the book. The reader is able to understand exactly what she is feeling at different stages of her journeys, whether it's excitement, self-pity, regret, sexual frustration or determination to succeed at her meditation. I believe it's this candidness that allows the reader to connect to her story, as I believe many of her own thoughts have been on everyone's mind at one point in time. However, this novel isn't just about empathy. We also learn of her traveling exploits; exploring the tropical islands of Indonesia, discovering fine cuisine with local friends in Italy, and meditating in an Indian monastery. Together, her time abroad is an entertaining read not only from a travel-log standpoint, but of an emotional and spiritual renewal as well.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" is not a typical vampire movie.  The more I think about it, the more I think that it shouldn't be viewed as a vampire movie at all.  It's a story told through the eyes of a 12-year old boy (Oskar).  He happens to live next door to a girl (Eli) seemingly his age, but someone quite different from him.  Of course, she's a vampire.  Oskar is constantly bullied at school.  He has a fascination for true crime stories and clips stories about murders out of the newspaper and saves them.  In a lot of ways Eli is his alter ego.  She's everything Oskar isn't.  She's strong and can be quite violent.  The two form a bond and spend a lot of time together in the dark of night.  Oskar eventually finds out about Eli, but is surprisingly unafraid.      Interesting to me was how \\"sloppy\\" Eli was at keeping her secret.  Vampires need human blood to live, and Eli is no different.  However, her kills aren't especially cunning.  Whether she's doing the killing or her human confidant, neither seem to be professional enough to get away with it for long.  Rather than taking homeless people or going after people in rural areas, their kills are very close to home and in rather populated areas.  Bodies aren't disposed of properly either.  I kind of liked the fact that everything wasn't covered up so neatly.  It gave the movie a much better feel of realism.  The movie is shot very well, and although dialog is both subtle and limited, the story is expertly told through visualizations.  Lots of credit to director Tomas Alfredson for resisting the temptation to do more.  The movie should be approached like a fine cognac.  Rather than just tossing it down quickly, one should take it slowly, enjoy the aroma, and sip.  This movie needs to be taken in as it is presented.  It's a little on the slow side, so don't expect anything exciting to happen.  Notice the setting, how things are shot, and appreciate the sadness the main characters are living with.  If you love film and view it as art, this movie is for you.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  If you expect a huge romance (Twilight), a lot of action, or a ton of suspense, you'll be disappointed.  If vampires were real and living among us, I'd like to think this is how life might be for them - especially for a 12-year old girl.    On a side note:  forget how the adults act in the movie.  Tomas Alfredson states in the special features that the adults are perhaps there but absent at the same time because the story is seen through Oskar's eyes.  Perhaps this is how Oskar views the adults.  Knowing this after the fact helped make sense of a few things.  I would have liked to have known this ahead of time.  Hopefully this helps you too.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I came within a few days, but we have not had time to see it yet. But have not had a bad movie from Amazon DIRECT ever.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|If you love wholesome period films like Sense & Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, North and South, Cranford, etc., order this immediately! It's almost 10 hours of heartwarming stories and endearing characters, wonderfully played by many of the British actors you've seen in other pieces. Everyone in my family absolutely loves it. Can't wait for season 2 to come out in February!
B002U9JEVA|5.0|On first listen (or just to the 30 second samples) one might not be to impressed with this album from Norah Jones. But on further listening, one can tell that this is definitely one of her strongest albums. All great artists explore different avenues. And she does this incredibly well. Just because 'The Fall' is not exactly what you are expecting to hear with Jones, she nails it. It has a much \\"rockier\\" sound. She doesn't use the piano as much as on her earlier albums. It's something new and exciting for her. And personally I loved it. It may take a couple listens, but it's well worth it.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I received this item just a few days ago.  Let me tell you it is amazing.  When you can hear every note played by john on the harmonica it is beyond amazing.  You will hear the music as never before.  Clearly, possibly for the first time.  Ringo's drumming is so clear and crisp. Never mind the musicianship you hear loud and clear from John, Paul and George.  But the little surprises are the best!  Little noises put in by the boys we have never been able to hear before.  Yes!  Yes! I would buy this in a heartbeat.  The music quality is that good.  As for the Apple......it is cute.  It is heavy.  It will become a collectable.  Plus it is an apple!  Never thought I'd get my hands on one!
B001AVCFJM|4.0|*>SPOILERS AHEAD<*  So, this movie is a \\"redo\\" of Star Trek going back to the events of the original series.  The casting is phenomenal, especially Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy and Zachary Quinto as Spock.  Both have their characters spot on.  And John Cho as Sulu rocks.  I was surprised with Wenona Ryder as Spock's mother, but that point is moot (as people who have seen the movie know).  The movie is very entertaining, even to a Star Trek fan as I am.  Though this movie targets people new to Star Trek, the movie would seem to be more enjoyable to Star Trek fans since there are numerous references to the television series.  The re-envisioning of the Star Trek world is certainly for the 21st century movie-goer.  There are lots of action, explosions, and special effects, but I feel this is a step backwards.  The original Star Trek focused on characters and had stories mirroring the current events of the time.  It certainly wasn't meant to be philosophical or tried to convey morality, but it did leave the viewer with some thought provoking ideas.  Though, I loved what Captain Pike told Kirk, \\"I dare you to do better.\\"  Yes!  And, what are all these light flares about?  I found them very distracting, especially with scenes within the Kelvin and the Enterprise.  In the commentary, the filming of this movie described borrowing elements from Star Wars.  No, no, no, no, and NO!  That's why Star Trek is popular today, it's different than Star Wars!  The monster chasing Kirk on the frozen planet reeked of Star Wars.  And I desperately hope Scotty's companion doesn't become another Jar Jar Binks (or even a Wesley Crusher, ugh).
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am delighted with the CD 'I Dreamed A Dream' by Susan Boyles.  The Amazon price was better than retail stores and it was available before the retail stores which allowed me to order several copies and receive them weeks before Christmas. I wanted to use the CD at a gift exchange in early December.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great show for the kids and the older kids.  Enjoyed the story and identified with the elder in the show.  Lots of great lessons easily received in an animated form.
0385340567|2.0|I want to reiterate what others are saying about this novel.  The liberal seeming anti-war, anti-christian Reacher was surprising.  I never thought of Reacher as being liberal or conservative, just a soldier doing his duty.  This book definitely puts Reacher left of center.  Plenty of my friends are liberals and we get along just fine, but then again we keep politics out of it.  And that's how a good novel should be. Besides, fiction should be for escapism, not to be reminded of the current controversial issue. Not sure I'll be as anxious to pick up another Reacher novel.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|No surprise.  A classic Eastwood movie with all his nuances.  By the end of the movie you are drawn in and care about all the people involved. Great job.
B000WPDCTE|5.0|This is an,initially unsuspecting, hilarious comedy, based mainly on a sweet and naive character. What begins as a mean-spirited \\"make-fun-of-the-dope\\" idea, develops into a laugh-out-loud, \\"we're totally rooting for this sweet guy\\", comedy. We first saw this movie on a plane returning from France, and we swear the whole plane was actually vibrating with the ensuing laughter!!
B000002J1Y|5.0|Bought this as a christmas gift for my husband,  very pleased with it. Fast ship/delivery. Recieved  in excellent condition.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|I bought this item in eager anticipation of capturing a few precious vinyl tracks I haven't heard in years, since changing all of my audio devices to digital. Upon unpacking the turntable and assiduously reading the manuals before trying to use it, I plugged it into the wall outlet. Nothing. How do you get the turntable to move? There's no power switch. Oddly enough, there is a STOP button, but no START button. So my frustration grew, and my anger at having purchased an item that seemed obviously to be defective became such that I immediately fired off an angry review to Amazon, characterizing the product as a piece of cheap trash. Well, that was unfair. After continuing to stare forlornly at the turntable and wondering why it simply didn't turn I moved it around manually for a few rotations. It was then that I noticed that the tone arm would rise and fall automatically with each cycle. So I raised the tone arm myself, and when I moved it over toward the platter it suddenly began to turn. THE SIMPLE ACT OF MOVING THE TONE ARM TOWARD THE PLATTER MAKES IT TURN! This may not be news to many who are more familiar with turntables, but all those which I've ever owned have had a simple on-off switch.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Five stars for Hilary Swank who plays the part of a woman pretending to be a man, (Brandon, a boy, really,) who gets entangled in her own wishful thinking and puts together lies that she believes in an effort to keep her life moving forward in the emptiness of Nebraska.  This is a pretty intricate construction for an actor to put together but we don't really see what Ms Swank has done until we get out of the movie.  While I was watching the movie I was held fast by Brandon's lives and hopes and hardly noticed that there was acting going on.  Five stars for the supporting actors in this movie; there is not one moment in the movie that we can't believe in.  Five stars for a totally convincing screenplay.  Five stars for the narrative; it could hardly earn less because the story is true.
0316168815|4.0|First of all, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though I didn't give it five hearts. The characters are so captivating, and the story quickly becomes addictive. Sebold does such an awesome job of creating realistic characters. It feels like Susie's story was really her own, and I could easily believe that she had a past before she was murdered.     This book reminds me of a car crash- you know, the one where the cars are completely totaled and people were injured or killed. Even though it's a horrific sight, every car on the highway slows down to catch a glimpse. We're grateful that it didn't happen to us, even though we feel for the victims. Why is it that we are so fascinated by tragedies? Susie's murder was extremely disturbing, yet I couldn't seem to stop reading. Unlike the many supernatural and fantasy novels I read, the killer in this book was just an ordinary man. Things like this happen every day, and that kept me thinking long into the night.     When I picked up this novel, I was immediately sucked into the middle of a family catastrophe. In the beginning, everything is falling apart. The Salmon's foundation is crumbling, and everything that can go wrong goes wrong. Then, with the help of friends and family, they begin to pick up the pieces. They remember how to love, how to move on, how to live. A wonderful new life blossoms out of the old. I think that this was what Sebold was trying to tell us- life is life. We have to keep living, no matter what.     The Lovely Bones was a powerful book. That's the best way to describe it. Trust me, read this and you won't regret it.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Adventure movies with heart and brains. These movies have cinematic style, visual effects,acting,direction and the three movies captures all of these characteristics. It totaly captivates the original spiderman. The actors were awsome particuarly Tobie Maguire and and Kristen Dunst, just outstanding. All three movies have spectacular entertainment.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|The movie is happy and extremely likable. This movie will definitely make you want to take ballroom dancing lessons. Richard learns lessons about life, love, friendship and basically becomes a better man.
B0000959N0|5.0|I thought it was smart, well written, well directed, and struck just the right tone for the material. Ben Affleck manages to make you believe in Matt Murdock, Jennifer Garner is both effective and stunning as Elektra. The movie focuses on the lead character and pushes almost everything else to the background. It's a great movie.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Colonel Wlliam Ludlow and his three sons (Samuel, Tristan and Alfred) live in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, USA, at the beginning of the 20th century. When Samuel brings with him his fianc&eacute; Susanna, the fellowship of the 3 brothers is about to be broken. The eldest son, Alfred, falls in love with Susanna, and she falls in love with Tristan. Thing becomes worse when the three brothers decide to join the first World War in Europe in 1914, despite their father's objection. The bond of the brothers is about to be broken forever, and so is Colonel William's heart.<br />This movie is exception. I was left nearly breathless. A dramatic movies that will leave a dramatic effect on you. Seriously an excellent movie.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Beautiful and incredibly moving movie. You may be young, old, poor, rich, happy, sad, confused, assertive, secure, insecure or just you. No matter which one or all that you may be, this movie will touch your mind and heart.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|This is a very inspiring movie for teens everywhere. I liked the moral of the story and overall the whole movie is great. Jessica Alba really out did her self and the new actors like Lil Romeo and Missy Elliot the movie is great.
B00003CX95|5.0|William Wallace is a Scottish rebel who leads an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself. When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland. Once he loses another of his loved ones, William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. A vastly entertaining and powerful movie. Braveheart is a truely epic film, it stands out as one of the top overall movies ever in my mind. The story is top-notch, the direction and acting/cast are equally great as well.
0790729687|5.0|It hadn't even been a year since a plantation owner named Louis had lost his wife in childbirth. Both his wife and the infant died, and now he has lost his will to live. A vampire named Lestat takes a liking to Louis and offers him the chance to become a creature of the night: a vampire. Louis accepts, and Lestat drains Louis' mortal blood and then replaces it with his own, turning Louis into a vampire. Louis must learn from Lestat the ways of the vampire. I thought this movie was wonderful. The costumes and the actors were impecable. Even though there is gore and blood, this movie is highly entertaining and I would highly recommend it.
B0009MDPYW|5.0|This is one of those movies that people either loved or they hated. Well I'm one of them that loved it. The storyline could have been a bit blasphemous for certain christians, but the acting and computer graphics fits perfectly with the time. The supporting cast also helped keep the story interesting. You can expect a bit of \\"the exorcist\\" in the film. I enjoyed this movie and think outside the box.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This movie has romance with a delicate touch. If you like romantic comedies, this is a very good one. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll have a smile on your face after watching this movie. This movie is awesome and everyone should see it.
6304779356|5.0|Financial troubles force a recent divorcee and her teenage sons Mike and Sam to settle down with her father in the California town of Santa Carla. At first, Sam laughs off rumours he hears about vampires who inhabit the small town. But after Mike meets a beautiful girl at the local amusement park, he begins to exhibit the classic signs of vampirism. Fearing for his own safety, Sam recruits two young vampire hunters to save his brother by finding and destroying the head vampire. I watch vampire movies, I prefer a more dramatic approach. This is the exception. This is a true 80's classic movie. Kiefer Sutherland is very good in this movie. A fun movie to watch.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Its combination of romance and fantasy adventure. An immensely satisfying movie. A masterful creation and direction by director Bryan Singer. If you enjoyed Superman movies when you were younger, don't fear you'll enjoy the new  version of the series.
B000O179A4|5.0|Eddie Murphy, in the finest work of his career, this movie will dazzle and delight you. A wonderful entertainment. Jennifer Hudson all I can say is wow. You will not be disappointed.
B000062XGG|5.0|On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. It has everything. This is the way you portray an alien ivasion movie. I loved the characters, the story, the special effects, the action, the love, the whole load. Independence Day is an entertaining sci-fi/adventure movie.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I enjoyed the movie simply for the way it looked and felt. A newer version of Bram Stoker's masterpiece. I must say that this thrilling movie is close to that masterpiece. Oldman is phenomanal as Count Dracul. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as professor Von Helsing. The visuals are just amazing and heart stopping. A must see movie.
B0006L0LNY|5.0|Catwoman is a movie that has a dark elegance and stylish moves. I thought the visual effects were awesome and Halle did a great job at bringing Catwoman alive.  This is a very fun and interesting movie.
0316069906|4.0|It is very hard to write a review of this book without expressing one's own view of the ethics of meat eating, as most of the reviews - and many of the comments to some of these reviews - demonstrate.  In fact, it is impossible to really separate the two when discussing a book that is both so personal in its narrative, and relentlessly focused on universal eating habits.  My review is no different.<br /><br />Taking a stab at the book itself:  I am not familiar with Foer's fictional works, but his background is evident as he lends the whole subject a compelling narrative and style that really make \\"Eating Animals\\" quite a page-turner (I read it in a day and a half).  To those familiar with this debate, the statistics are not really new, nor are the horror stories of factory farming.  What is new is the personalization of his approach (I too am a father and could relate to the decisions he faces), and, most effectively, his unflinching, relentless, repetitious focus on the reality of consuming 99% of the available meat today:  The environmental damage, the suffering, the waste, the lies and corruption, the exploitation, the veil of secrecy amongst the industrial farming concerns.  It is Foer's relentless focus of these central issues and his unwillingness to avoid the obvious question (How can it be ethical to consume meat under these conditions?) that I believe distinguish this book and make it most effective.<br /><br />So what does this mean to this reviewer in terms of his personal habits?  Well, I am a long-time consumer of meat. I love everything about it in terms of taste, texture, variety, preparation, culture, etc.  I am a serious hobbyist-cook, and meat has played a central role in what I prepare...Though largely tolerant/indifferent to others' eating habits, I have been largely turned off by the vegetarian and (especially) vegan communities as a whole.  I have long viewed veganism as another example of our (U.S.) puritanical tradition of extreme reaction and self-denial to complex moral issues, married up with our (U.S.) lack of a strong, traditional food culture (go to somewhere like France or Spain, or Vietnam, and the difference is night and day).  That said, when I read \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" a few years ago, I did change many of my habits, and my purchases became almost exclusively organic for ethical reasons. However, like Pollan, I continued to eat meat, though shifting to more ethically raised and killed sources.<br /><br />Now having recently completed Foer's book, I have yet to consume meat, and really this is because Foer's central \\"decision\\" is so unavoidable:  Either you don't eat meat, or you support a lot of animal pain and suffering.  I believe meat-eating can be ethical, but right now, in our world, it is really just too screwed up and sick to be patronized.  So bringing together the book itself and my personal reaction to it, I would say this book is profoundly \\"impactful\\" (not a word - I know), if my reaction is representative of anything.  I am still contemplating meat consumption for the long term, as deep down I think there is something fundamentally \\"not right\\" and borderline neurotic about complete self-denial of meat - I mean, it is so closely tied to our evolution and culture, and its presence is strong in almost every single human society, indigenous or otherwise.  But until this settles in my mind, it feels better to just say \\"no\\".  And ultimately, how it \\"feels\\" is probably going to be the ultimate deciding factor for me, because I don't believe ethical debates are ultimately solved through pure logic...Foer seems to say this as well...<br /><br />I do have one big issue with \\"Eating Animals\\", and that is with regards to the future of killing animals for food (which I doubt will ever go away):  How will the more acceptable animal food operations that Foer admires - like Frank Reese's turkey farm - ever develop into something beyond the fringe, when ethically minded people go straight tonon-meat consumption?  It does seem a bit disingenuous to promote these meat farms and then say you will not patronize them, as (SPOILER ALERT) Foer does.<br /><br />So I am no longer eating meat for some time (maybe forever) as a result of this book, which is I believe is a testament to the power of the author's words.  My only pressing issue now is what do I feed my cat?
B001OQCV24|1.0|Poor, horrific, sad, terrible, laughable, dimwitted and moronic are words that best describe this \\"epic picture,\\" \\"2012\\" but even that cannot fully articulate how incredibly awful and boring and abominable this movie is. From the over-dramatic made-for-TV performances to the lousy writing, editing and script to the hairball storyline that moves around faster than the people getting up to leave this movie, this is totally abysmal from the moment the huge \\"2012\\" title is imposed over the movie screen to the final credits.     It is hard to believe that anyone with connected brain cells would consider this utter effluent entertainment in even the most naive sense of the word. Because there is nothing fun, interesting or even educational about this movie. Instead, this movie, like a root canal, is holding on to that last painful nerve and simply won't let go. And who in the world wrote this screenplay, and why did he bother?    None of the actors are worth a hill of beans, but Woody Harrelson perhaps wins the award for the most foolish character thrown into this bag of mixed nuts. Yes, everyone does know his name, because he's made such a lousy name for himself, appearing in so many repugnant movies. But \\"2012\\" is without a doubt the proverbial notch on his bedpost that will banish Mr. Harrelson to infomercial hell.     And whose bright idea was it to cast John Cusack in the lead role? The man has about as much charm and charisma as a bag of broken glass shards. With all the money wasted on this turkey one would think the producers and studio big-shots would have paid a little more attention to who was staring in this picture.     As someone who not only paid for full admission but who also regrettably sat through this entire bomb I can wholeheartedly attest that the only pleasure I derived from this entire ordeal was leaving the multiplex. If you want to waste 2 hours of your time by being bored to sheer agony then by all means please watch this movie. Otherwise go scrub your kitchen floor, put away your dishes or re-grout your bathroom; your time will be much better spent and you'll be eons more thrilled, and amused.
6305558167|5.0|This film, as much as it is a portrayal of the legend of King Arthur or more specifically an adaptation of 'La morte d'Arthur', is a fitting homage to the work of Richard Wagner. Not only does the film frequently invoke major pieces of music from Wagner's most mature opera; Tristan und Isolde, Gotterdamerung and Parsifal, but the allusions to the nordic myths upon which Wagner's opera are based are blended seamlessly into the narrative of the Arthurian legend. This movie is a keeper.
0061766089|5.0|There have been a lot of books in the last few years about how to take the mental and practical approaches of the design discipline and apply them more broadly in business and in life. Some of these, like Daniel Pink's [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]] and Marty Neumeier's [[ASIN:0321580060 The Designful Company: How to build a culture of nonstop innovation]], were quite good, and I recommend them to readers interested in the topic. \\"Change by Design\\" ranks with those as one of the best, I think.<br /><br />The book has two strengths. One is a lucid definition of what it means to think like a designer, and what the design process should look like when executed the right way. The second is a practical discussion of how \\"design thinking\\" can and should be integrated into the larger work of a business or agency. \\"'Design' is no longer a discrete stylistic gesture thrown at a project just before it is handed off to marketing,\\" Tim Brown writes. \\"The new approach taking shape in companies and organizations around the world moves design backward to the earliest stages of a product's conception and forward to the last stages of its implementation -- and beyond\\" (p. 148). This approach, of course, makes everyone a \\"designer,\\" a point some of the other authors I mentioned have stressed as well. If this is really the new way of doing business -- and if it isn't, it should be -- that makes understanding design, how to do it, and why it matters important topics, maybe the essential topics, for study. \\"Change by Design\\" is a great way to begin that education.
0767811070|5.0|Three black male teens come-of-age in the gang \\"war zones\\" of South Central Los Angeles. The rough neighborhoods of America often are ignored by the propaganda of politics and media that focuses more on the positives and successes of American Life, Culture and Society. Singleton's vision in this movie, in a very grounded format is compelling in giving \\"Pleasantville America\\" a picture of an America that experiences terrorism on a daily basis. It helps explain why there is crime and harshness in these neighborhoods and most importantly clearly delineates the American Government's failure at addressing poverty in the ghettos of America by showing how the cops seem to treat all blacks in the ghetto as if they are animals and not as human beings with compassion.  Cuba Gooding, Ice Cube were breath taking in their acting.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|This movie has a slam-dunk cast--Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks. Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan. Tim Curry as Rooster. Bernadette Peters as Lily. The original Broadway show has a ton of great, catchy tunes and a pretty tight book. And yet, this adaptation just doesn't work. I know it's difficult to transfer a stage play to film, but Annie would seem to be easier than most, as it already has a big cast and multiple settings. This just isn't a very compelling movie for three reasons: 1) They added songs and took out others. The new songs don't have the \\"oomph\\" of the original show tunes. In a word, they're boring. 2) John Huston's direction drags, drags, drags. 3) I'm going to say it--Aileen Quinn just didn't have the spark Annie needs. She has no edge, no genuine spunk. Mostof her line delivery sounds contrived. Watch this with a little kid--you'll enjoy it more because she/he will. But if you're a fan of musicals, don't bother with this adaptation.
0800141660|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />When those daughters are from Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. Ang Lee deftly adapted Ausen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" into the sort of movie it should be -- a lushly beautiful, quietly passionate period drama.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow  (Gemma Jones) and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor (Emma Thompson) begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward (Hugh Grant)... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne (Kate Winslet) soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby (Greg Wise).<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />I have to give Emma Thompson credit -- she not only turns in a brilliant, tightly-wound performance as Elinor (although she does look a bit old for the role), but she also wrote the faithful, solidly written script for Ang Lee's movie. The narrative glides silkily through the story, and adapts Austen's writing into elegantly vivid dialogue (\\"Can he love her? Can the soul really be satisfied with such... POLITE affections?\\") with some moments of gentle humor (\\"How did you find the silver? Was it all genuine?\\").<br /><br />And Ang Lee takes what Thompson has wrought and makes it even lovelier, filling it with pale light, misty country hills, luxurious manorhouses, sunlit gardens and yards, and rain-swept fields where handsome men go riding on horseback. He has the knack for coaxing intense emotions from small gestures and words, and evoking budding love that is unsaid and unexpressed until the end (especially for Edward and Elinor). The absolute peak of his skill is right before Marianne's terrible illness, when she's left standing on a hilltop in the rain, whispering a Shakespearean sonnet.<br /><br />Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. Thompson plays Elinor as being tightly wound and a bit repressed, while Winslet races joyously through the dramatic and romantic parts of the story, only for Marianne to crash and burn when Willoughby betrays her.<br /><br />And the supporting cast is no less brilliant -- Jones and Rickman are particularly good as the girls' loving mother, and the mellow, quiet Colonel Brandon (the man \\"everyone thinks well of, and nobody remembers to talk to\\") who stands by hoping for Marianne's happiness. Wise, Robert Hardy, Elizabeth Spriggs and Harriet Walters all give excellent performances, and even Hugh Grant (who usually annoys me like an unreachable itch) did a good job as the shy, studious Edward.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. And it was beautifully done by both of the people at its core -- Thompson's writing and acting, and Ang Lee's direction.alogue (\\"Can he love her? Can the soul really be satisfied with such...

0205313426|5.0|I know what you're thinking; a grammar book, Ebony? Yes, a grammar book. The Elements of Style is the best book I read in 2009 for one reason: it changed the way I approach writing.<br /><br />Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity - it's that simple. Say what you mean to say without all the thrills and frills and people will love you for it. This was a revelation to me. When I was in high school, I loved using big, ten dollar words in my essays; I garnered the praises and accolades of my teachers and the envy of my peers. Then I went to college and took a few English classes to see what they knew and WHAM!<br /><br />My ego was officially deflated during my freshman year. I was told by a very dear English professor that my writing was convoluted. \\"Explicate, explicate, explicate,\\" she would write in the margins of my papers.<br /><br />I wish I had a copy of Elements of Style back then. If only William Stunk Jr. and E.B. White were there to hold my hand and whisper in my ear, \\"Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.\\" Sheer brilliance.<br /><br />This book is filled with so many pearls of writing wisdom: do not break sentences in two; use the active voice; place yourself in the background. Chapter four, \\"Words and Expressions Commonly Misused,\\" is a breath of fresh air for any writer who is serious about her craft.<br /><br />I can go on and on about this book. As Reading Rainbow's LeVar Burton would say, \\"You don't have to take my word for it.\\"
0143039504|5.0|Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.<br /><br />And the Penguin Classics Deluxe edition of Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of Austen's finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.<br /><br />Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.<br /><br />And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.<br /><br />The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").<br /><br />Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has aflaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I got the two disc DVD set of Citizen Kane.  The film was quite controversial of the time and RKO Pictures originally was not going to play it because of the pressure put to bear by William Randolph Hearst, famous newspaper magnate and philanthropist.  Even to this day, the Hearst Corporation has its fingers in every pie:  radio, television, cable, satellite broadcasting, etc.  Hearst did not like that Orson was making what amounted to an unauthorized criticism on Hearst himself.<br /><br />Similarities?  Oh yes!  Although the names were changed, the film follows Hearst's life to a Tee, with a lot of creative license being taken.<br /><br />Orson Welles, only 24 years old, who, flushed from his success on the Mercury Theater and his famous (or infamous) broadcast, War of the Worlds, he created what many consider the best film of all time and many consider the beginning of the end of Orson's career as a radio, stage and film master of entertainment.<br /><br />[For those who do not know, on Halloween night back in the 1930s, with America concerned about Hitler's advances in Europe, Welles adapted H.G. Wells War of the Worlds with realistic-sounding newscasts and had the Martians invading Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  Many people actually believed these broadcasts to be REAL and panicked!  Radio was like TV is today, with soaps, westerns, news, and so on as main entertainment and so having your shows interrupted by newscasts and bulletins was common.  This created major controversy and put Orson on the map!]<br /><br /> But back to the review:<br /><br />Charles Foster Kane, as a child,  is being taken away as the family can no longer have him.  His mother is played stoically by Agnes Moorhead, a strong character actress in her own right (well before \\"Bewitched!\\" the cheesy sitcom of the Sixties.).<br /><br />Kane gets a newspaper, expands his empire, builds a castle (in Florida rather than San Simeon (current location of Hearst Castle), collects art as well as pretty girls, runs for office, confronts scandal and finally dies, dropping a snow globe and whispers \\"Rosebud.\\"<br /><br />Why Rosebud?  Well, the newspaper guys who are creating the news reel (News On The March!) want to know more about Kane and what Rosebud is.  The film then goes through a lot of flashbacks and personal interviews with fictional (and thinly disguised) friends of Kane to find out more about the man, his mission and what was Rosebud.<br /><br />Was Kane a self-seeking vampire who sucked the spirit out of everyone he came in contact with?  Or did his childhood memories still haunt him decades after the fact?<br /><br />Melodramatic to the extreme, some scenes were slow-paced.  The black & white photography was simply gorgeous.  And getting a peak at life as it might have been like in the early 20th Century was enjoyable and fascinating.<br /><br />Disc Two:  Wow, this was great.  Actual filmed interviews with Orson Welles done in the 1980s before his death.  You can see his eyes light up as he recalled the creative energy he possessed as a very young man, creating plays in Harlem with an all Black cast in creating Shakespeare for the masses.<br /><br />Touched on are the Mercury Theater broadcasts for CBS and the War of the Worlds broadcast.  The narrator said it best:  Orson accomplished it all at a young age and then was burned and never came back after Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Extensive biographical data on Welles and Hearst, both driven men, both creative geniuses in their own ways, proud and gifted and heading on a collision course with each other.<br /><br />\\"A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.\\"<br />-Orson Welles<br /><br />\\"Even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit.\\"<br />Orson Welles<br /><br />\\"I started at the top and worked down.\\"<br />Orson Welles<br /><br />More on Orson Welles:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0140254560 Orson Welles: Volume 1: The Road to Xanadu]]<br />[[ASIN:0140275177 Orson Welles: Volume 2: Hello Americans]]<br /><br />More on War of the Worlds Broadcast:<br /><br />[[ASIN:184933028X War of the Worlds: Featuring Orson Welles]]<br />[[ASIN:B000SAAT6M The Orson Welles' War of the Worlds Scandal]]<br /><br />More on Willam Randolph Hearst:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0883659700 Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst]]<br />[[ASIN:0618154469 The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst]]n Welles: Volume 1: The Road to Xanadu]]<br />[[ASIN:0140275177 Orson Welles: Volume 2: Hello Americans]]<br /><br />More on War of the Worlds Broadcast:<br /><br />[[ASIN:184933028X War of the Worlds: Featuring Orson Welles]]<br />[[ASIN:B000SAAT6M The Orson Welles' War of the Worlds Scandal]]<br /><br />More on Willam Randolph Hearst:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0883659700 Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst]]<br />[[ASIN:0618154469 The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst]]
B0000019HU|5.0|Slint is one of the few bands that is depressingly obscure. SPIDERLAND is [[ASIN:B000002G7C The Velvet Underground & Nico]] of the 1990's: few people bought it, but it still had a wide ranging influence on experimental rock throughout the '90s and into this century. Slint sound like NOBODY else in the music, then or now. Their combination of spoken/whispered/screamed vocals, dissonant guitar melodies, and off-kilter rhythmic changes is something so unique it can't, and shouldn't, be mimicked. The atmosphere of this album is dark, quiet, and extremely unsettling. Brian McMahan's vocal delivery is one of the main aspects that contributes to this doom-laden mood. Just listen to the songs \\"Don, Aman\\" and \\"Good Morning, Capitain\\" and you'll be scared [...]! David Pajo's guitar genius cannot be overstated, as he has a unique style that permeates this album (those high notes on \\"Breadcrumb Trail\\" and \\"Nosferatu Man\\" are just otherworldly). Perhaps the most underrated of all the musicians on this album is drummer Britt Walford. He has a drumming style that combines the technicality and looseness of jazz drummers such as Elvin Jones with the sheer muscular force of hard rock, paving the way for drummers like Damon Che. SPIDERLAND is a wonderfully strange and creepy album full of musical surprises that jump out from the eerie silence--much like a musical haunted house. Highlights include: \\"Breadcrumb Trail,\\" \\"Washer,\\" and \\"Good Morning, Captain.\\"

B000001FZK|5.0|Probably the most beautiful rock CD I own, Talk Talk's LAUGHING STOCK is the swan song of the band who is credited for founding the post-rock genre. A marvelous thing about LAUGHING STOCK is that it doesn't sound like it was made in any particular decade; it is a truly timeless album. Mark Hollis and Tim Friese-Green gathered some magnificent studio musicians recorded LAUGHING STOCK in much the same way as they did on the previous album [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]]. Highlights include the minimalistic opener \\"Myrrhman,\\" \\"Ascension Day,\\" and \\"After the Flood\\" with its quiet but powerful organ parts and slightly swinging drum beat. Along with SPIRIT OF EDEN, LAUGHING STOCK represents Talk Talk at their creative peak. This album still stubbornly holds its place as one of my top 10/desert-island discs.

1416594787|3.0|NO SHOW AT ALL: THE GREATEST BLUNDER ON EARTH!    With his new book, The Greatest Show on Earth, Evidence of Evolution, Richard Dawkins admits that he has always assumed evolution without ever proving it. Creationists have often accused him of doing exactly that. He attempts to fill this gap now.  He will have to keep trying, though.     Richard Dawkins compares evolution with a crime scene to which there were no eye witnesses.     He arrives on the alleged crime scene and starts making his own detective-like inferences so as to present the evidence in a court. But, wait a minute! How does he know a crime has been committed in the first place? Dawkins wants to be left alone in his \\"crime-scene\\" and select and interpret the evidence in a way that supports his bias.     But the dead body might as well have been the result of an accident or a suicide! All the evidence must be analyzed, different witness accounts and interpretations must be admitted and thoroughly debated. That is true, even after the jury has already made its decision. Judicial decisions must be open to revision when new evidence shows up. There is no res judicata in the creation v. evolution debate.     Comparing evolution a priori nwith a crime scene only goes to show that Dawkins cannot help but approaching the evidence with his own (naturalist, evolutionary and uniformitarian) bias.  That is an important point, when it comes to understanding all of Dawkins work.      Richard Dawkins accuses Creationists of being History-deniers, comparing them with Holocaust deniers. That's a nice rhetorical trick. Were you fooled by it?     In fact, Dawkins is the one who denies all the relevant historical records about God's presence in History, through the people of Israel and the life and death of Jesus Christ.     What's more, he denies more than 200 flood narratives from many different ancient cultures in all continents. Dawkins attempts to dismiss the biblical eyewitness accounts as Bronze age records, so asto fool his readers.     But he forgets that before and during the writing of the Bible, Pyramids were being built and the foundations and standards of philosophy, literature, mathematics, geometry, architecture, engineering and astronomy were being laid.     In fact, the naturalism, atomism and evolutionism emerged at that same time. Contrary to his suggestions, ancient Man was highly intelligent, and already debated creation v. evolution.     Archaeology demonstrates that the ancient Man could also be remarkably accurate in its eyewitness accounts of events. Dawkins also assumes that a personal God did not reveal Himself in historical and propositional way. But that's just his own assumption.     It must also be remembered, that the purpose of most Holocaust deniers is to degrade the Jews, because of their historical and theological significance.   The purpose of Richard Dawkins is to degrade Jewish sacred texts, also because of their historical and theological significance. That is not a coincidence. That is a highly significant pattern from a theological perspective.      Dawkins prefers DNA, skulls and bones as evidence, and dismisses eyewitness accounts. The problem is that science, with its emphasis on observation and experimentation is primarily based on eyewitness accounts.     Historiography depends basically on eyewitness accounts, there existing methods to validate them.     Did historians study the Roman Empire, whose denial Dawkins finds unthinkable, based on DNA, fossils and bones? Did historians dismiss eyewitness accounts when studying Hannibal, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Caesar, Charles Magnus or Henry VIII? Did they rely on DNA for that? So why should they dismiss independent ancient sources when studying the Flood or Jesus Christ?     There are long established ways of comparing, dating and validating ancient historical texts.      What's more, if Dawkins would leave out all eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust, he himself would probably becomea Holocaust denier. And if he would study Adolph Hitler based only on skulls and bones, he would probably have concluded that Hitler was a woman!      Dawkins ideas are not only silly. They are self-defeating!     Then comes the so called evidence of evolution. We learn from Dawkins that living beings \\"evolve\\" according to their own kinds and that the different species come from original broader gene pools, without gaining new and complex structures.     Creationists would not really question this kind of observed \\"evolution\\", in which \\"Canis lupus\\" evolve to... \\"canis familiaris\\" (i.e. dogs evolve to... dogs), Primroses evolve to...Primroses, orchids evolve to...orchids, Hummingbirds evolve to... Hummingbirds, insects evolve to...insects, guppies evolve to... guppies, bacteria evolve to...bacteria, etc. evolves to... etc. Just like God said they would.     We also learn from Dawkins (as if we didn't already know!) that natural selection and speciation can take place very quickly. Those observations are totally compatible with what the Bible teaches. There are different kinds, there is great variety within each kind and rapid natural selection and speciation explain the post-flood variation, adaptation and specialization within each kind.     For Dawkins, evolution has as many different speeds as his evolutionary assumptions require.     However, when Dawkins speaks about rapid adaptation, selection and speciation he is actually proving an important biblical point about pos-flood diversity. He seems not to have understood this. When he speaks of living fossils with little or no change, he is also proving an important biblical point, about the preservation of the different kinds.     As to molecular comparisons of genetic similarities and differences, they point to a Common Creator, as in Genesis 1. Mutations and loss of organs and functions point do the curse and deterioration of Creation, as in Genesis 3. The geological and fossil record, along with plate tectonics and continental drift, point to a global Flood, as in Genesis 6 to 9.       Proving that the Earth is old is important to Dawkins.     But it is a very difficult task when one dismisses all ancient records, and relies only on present observations and extrapolations based on naturalistic and uniformitarian assumptions. Dawkins admits that dendrochronology does not allow him to get very far into deep time. The same is true about C-14. He has only some radioactive isotope dating methods, but he has to assume uniformitarian conditions to prove his point.      But that is not a logically sound way to deny a Global Flood, which, according to the Bible had a supernatural cause, a supernatural purpose and made a supernatural point: there is a spiritual, all powerful moral God who reigns above the laws of physics He has established and is able to enforce His moral law when, how and as He pleases. One cannot deny the acts of an omnipotent God simply by appealing to the laws of physics. On the one hand, the existence of the laws of physics, chemistry and biology points to an ordered Creation.     On the other hand, the independent, detailed and consistent records of historical events that derogate these same laws (v.g. global flood, miracles, physical resurrection of Jesus Christ) point to an omnipotent Creator.  This should lead us to take God's revelation seriously, instead of relying in man made naturalistic and materialistic assumptions.     There is stronger historical evidence that Jesus Christ performed miracles and raised from the dead, than that life arose by chance of that we all came evolved from a common ancestor. We now know can say for sure that Moses wrote most of the the first five books of the Bible, possibly based on previous accounts, before other ancient texts like the Gilgamesh Epic or Enuma Elish.      Besides, how can we ignore more than 200 flood narratives from the ancient world, along with evidence of accelerated nuclear decay, C-14 in diamonds, fossils, rocks and coal dated as millions of years old?     How can we ignore the mounting global evidence of catastrophe in the rocks and fossils?     How can we ignore the evidence from Helium in zircon cristals, many discordant radioisotope dates, old ages for recent rocks, or Polonium radiohalos in granite?     How can we ignore soft tissue, amino acids, blood vessels, or proteins, in T Rex and Hadrossaur bones supposedly 65 and 80 million years old?     How can we ignore soft tissue in a Salamandra fossil supposedly 18 million years old? How can we ignore the fishes of the Silurian sees?     What about all the dinosaur bones found after the so called Cretaceous extinction?     What about all the recent evidence that suggests the Dover Cliffs, or the Mediterranean See, were the result of extraordinarily catastrophic water flows?     What about the recent studies on transposons that cast serious doubts on the theory of a common ancestor of Chimpanzees and Human beings? What about all the evidence that suggests that Neanderthals were fully human?     All this evidence is published in scientific books and journals. Just search Science Daily for references.     Dawkins' bias leads him to a selective approach to and a distorted interpretation of the evidence.     Richard Dawkins goes a great length to present the Lenski experiment  as evidence that the \\"crime\\" is still being committed now. He states that it is really a brilliant experiment that Creationists hate and want to find fault in.     But Creationist don't hate real science. Creationists only have problems with Dawkins evolutionary \\"theora\\" (i.e. observed fact, evolutionary fiction and lots of bla, bla, bla!).     The fact is that Lenski himself admits that after 40 000 generations and the accumulation of 653 mutations things start to get pretty ugly to the Lenski 12 tribes of E.Coli. What started to be a powerful evolutionary experiment, with bactgeria gaining size and some of them processing citrate, turned out to be a lesson on the degenerative effect of cumulative mutations.     With the Lenski experiment don't learn much on how bacteria become bacteriologists, but at least we understand cancer and the spread of diseases much better.      Mutations are not about new information. They are mostly about noise that degrades pre-existing coded information. DNA may not be a blueprint in a literal sense, as Dawkins rightly remarks, but it is certainly coded information, whose transcription, translation, copy and execution (by complex specified molecular machines previously coded) allows for the production, reproduction and adaptation of the different kinds of living beings.     And, Richard Dawkins RNA-world speculations notwithstanding, coded information can only have an intelligent source.  There is no known natural law or physical process capable to create coded information.         What follows is a purely highly speculative and controversial interpretation of the fragmentary fossil record and its relation with molecular clocks, based on evolutionary assumptions and beliefs.     The fact is that hard evidence has recently raised serious doubts on DNA based dates, undermining many of Dawkins assumptions and conclusions. What's more, the fact that Dawkins lists the Darwinus masilae (\\"Ida\\") as evidence of evolution, when it has already been discarded as such by evolutionary scientists themselves, only shows that how good it is that the Bible is the Word of God and not just a scientific book.     The same is true about the Tiktaalik. It is presented as a perfect link between fish and tetrapods, even if it has already been dismissed by evolujtionists themselves, following recent footprints findings in Poland.     It is raining. Lenski, Ida, Tiktaalik, etc, are all wet. The \\"Greatest Show\\" is becomming the greatest cold water shower. Evolutionists will have to keep the rain ticket.     Dawkins book came out a few months ago and is already scientifically outdated. Richard Dawkins presents as evidence of evolution facts, fossils and experiments that really have nothing to do with evolution, according to evolutionists themselves.     If Dawkins can be so wrong when he speaks of evolution, a subject to which he has devoted so much attention to and pretends to know so well, just imagine how wrong and off the mark he can be when he speaks of alleged mistakes and contradictions of the Bible.     It is much easier to find silly ideas, contradictions and mistakes in Dawkins books. And one doesn't need  to be a Creationist to do it.       There is no trace of evolution in this book. Coded information in the genomes, genetic similarities, mutations, trillions of fossils around the world, transcontinental sedimentary rock layers, isotope concentrations, continental drift, plate tectonics, natural selection, rapid adaptation and speciation, are all evidence of Creation, the Curse, the Flood and rapid repopulation of the world.     All the evidence presented in this book supports the Bible.      The only evidence we get from this book is that Dawkins indeed believes in evolution. That we already knew for sure.     How  this book has been able to fool its endorsers and many readers around the world remains one of the greatest mysteries of evolutionary theory.     He will get 3 stars because he is an excellent scientific fiction writer, though.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this series, although I tried to slowly savor it!  Just got too caught up in the lives and drama.  Absolutely delightful and highly recommended.  For those stuck on the book (which I haven't read) I can only say that the screenwriters must have improved it, because I can't imagine more engaging storylines.  Laughter, surprises, tears and more surprises (especially the last episode)!!  So glad the BBC produces such high quality material, because there's nothing this high of caliber on American t.v.  Can't wait to see more in February when Season 2 comes out!

B00171LFFK|5.0|This Japanese import is the REMASTERED Astral Weeks; FAR SUPERIOR to the domestic Warner Bros. version available to consumers in the U.S. Why Warner Bros. has failed to remaster Astral Weeks for the U.S. market can only be wondered at; aren't we U.S. consumers just as deserving as our Japanese counterparts of superior quality product? It is shameful and a blatant attempt at parting you of your hard-earned cash for a shoddily-produced product because the record companies know they can get away with it. It sucks that I have to buy this CD at import prices to get a decent digital transfer of a genuine masterpiece. My recommendation; suck it up and buy this import if you TRULY LOVE this record, and are tired of waiting for Warner Bros. (U.S.) to get of their asses and do the right thing; after all, they remastered virtually all of Van's other albums--even the crappy ones. Sounds amazing!
0307346617|5.0|It was an awesome book. Made me almost cry. Pissed me off. Made me question the possibilities on what i would do.   It got a bit repetitive about 3/4 through. Thankfully the guy ended the slowly increasing monotony by well ending it with a really inspiring conclusion. Loved it.
B002QGUFWE|3.0|...I don't like it when artists release deluxe editions after you purchase their first. I am one of those people who wishes they would have informed me sooner to wait. I really enjoy the Fame and the new songs on Fame Monster. I wasn't into Lady Gaga, I found her annoying at first, then I caught the Paparazzi video and saw something I liked. She was like a little Cher or Madonna with the crazy outfits and makeup; and I thought she was a genius to get a whole \\"haus\\" to back up her character: Lady Gaga especially at such a young age. She's the first pop star in a long time that I have seen see, fame and mold it her way, manufactured yes but damn it the girl knows it and plays with it. Seeing her doesn't flash warning signs the way Britney did, like this girl is being pushed and is gonna fall when she turns 20.     I think it's silly for people to expect profound lyrics from Lady Gaga. The name let alone screams entertainer not poet laureate. I think eventually she will get better I think the song \\"Speechless\\" is showing her growth as a lyricist. She is still very young. Famous at 23 people what worldly advice can she give me? I think people looking for profound lyrics need to by a Dylan or Lennon album. Looking for meaning in a Gaga album right now is like trying to find Hamlet's \\"to be or not to be\\" monologue in Madonna's \\"Lucky Star.\\" She fun, just be entertained.     P.S. For those complaining about the editing on the word Bitch. I'm pretty sure it's not. At her concert in San Diego she was singing \\"Ima free Bi*, I'm a free Bit-\\" editing herself. I think it's her new thing. Silly yes but not edited.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Just saw it this morning.  Here's what I liked.<br /><br />1. Beautifully different.  Just the look that is.  It's like puppet show and a painting coming to life in front of you.  Just gorgeous.<br /><br />2. It's not CGI.  I'm getting really weary of CGI movies that are all about gags and CGI tricks and not about the story or the characters.<br /><br />3. Very character driven by today's standards.  I found myself caring for the main characters right from the get-go, which is not something that happens a lot anymore, sadly.  I really believed Mr. and Mrs. Fox were a married couple, and the family dynamic was very familiar and believable.<br /><br />4. Great supporting character critters.  Just a lot of fun with all the different animals and their unique abilities and quirks contributing to the story.<br /><br />5. There was humor, but it didn't come across as trying to be funny all the time.  It's there, and maybe some of it fell flat, but that sort of added to the charm.  Too many of these family CGI type movies try too hard to be funny, and they're not.  Part of humor is that it's unexpected.<br /><br />6.  The soundtrack.  Just plain fun and the minimalist bluegrass sounding stuff just seemed totally appropriate.  I'm going to be buying some Bobby Fuller Four music soon.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Phil Seymour made an excellent rendition of Let Her Dance.  Very much like the Bobby Fuller Four version but about 3 minutes and made more recently with better recording quality.  Check it out if you like this song.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />1.  Was this for kids or not?  At the end of the movie I asked my chidren, who've seen quite a few movies, what the point was or what they remembered, and they didn't say much.  They really didn't seem to like it.

The use of \\"cuss\\" where cussing would be was clever.  The kids didn't get what they weren't supposed to get, but I think they crossed the line a bit when they used the term \\"cluster cuss\\".  That's a variant of a deeply crass term used in a short, useless and throwaway scene that didn't even need to be there, and I feel sad for any parents whose kids ask them to decode that one.<br /><br />Finally, I'm reviewing the movie and not the DVD product.

B000X6XHEW|5.0|I downloaded this album only a couple days ago, but I can't stop listening to it. When I turn it off I keep hearing it in my head and I have to play it again... I have no idea what they're saying, but it doesn't matter. The melody, the harmony, the rhythm are all perfect. These collections of songs are more than just some people playing notes. All of these songs are performed by musicians that really enjoy playing them, and their emotion and enthusiasm shows. Now I have to go learn Spanish just so I can understand what they're singing about...
B002SJIO5E|2.0|The big problem I have with this disk is that it does not have an unfettered Dolby Digital track (it does have a \\"descriptive\\" track which means in addition to the surround your have to listen to a narrator describe each scene).  I do not have a DTS receiver so my only choice is PCM with only gives me stereo, not surround, which significantly diminishes the movie.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Not only does this film have some of the finest cinematography I've ever seen, the way this oft-told story was detailed was a real treat. The acting was excellent, and the soundtrack was also superb.    Hard to ask more from any movie: I highly recommend it.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I have to qualify this review with the following disclaimer... I never followed the comic book series or cartoons as a kid or teen.  I'm just an adult female who LOVES movies, especially superhero flicks.  Now, with that said, I have never been a fan of the Batman franchise.  I found the earlier Batman films, despite their all-star credibilities, be \\"over the top\\" in every deparment (set, acting, dialogue).  As a fan of Christian Bale, however, I was anxious to see the Batman Begins installment.  Bale is an amazing actor, even in his younger days with Empire of the Sun to much later with American Psycho or a little more recently with The Mechanic.  This was the finest of all the Batman films - darker and with more depth.  It was good enough for this non-Batman fan to purchase for my home collection.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is the 1st Sophia Kinsella book I've read and I loved it! I couldn't put it down. I will definately be buying more books by this author.
1439157383|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, but wow was I surprised at the end.  Would I have preferred a \\"happy ending? Of course, but then again life does not always give us happy endings.
B002UJIY7A|1.0|If you don't figure this thing out before they even finish the opening titles, you need help. Painfully obvious twists, given away so early in the film, that it boggles the mind. The acting is fair, although Tim Olyfant is a bit over the top. Wanted it to be so much better than it was. Very predictable if you even slightly pay attention. This thing almost turns into a parody of itself at the end. Not good.
B00007LTIA|1.0|When in high school I almost destroyed my treasured \\"Yes\\" LPs, because I listened for these albums for hours and hours - as thousands of other suckers did, searching for some secret knowledge and hidden message. Bugger it - there is none. Centuries later I suspected already the existence of Internet, but I didn't know anything about Amazon - otherwise I would have bought them from Amazon and save the trouble of a trip to \\"Tower Records\\" in London. Well, I bought them on CDs and kept listening to until I came to a painful conclusion: we are dealing with musical Maoists who are in the dark room searching for a black cat, and they don't even want to admit that it's not there. Somehow the music reminds an elaborated and over-decorated facade which hides an ugly naked truth - a simple concrete pavillion of a public WC. \\"Yes\\" are exceptional musicians who go on and on into lengthy improvisations, showcasing of instrumental prowess and complicated construction of songs, while tin falsetto of Anderson wandering above - looking to which part to stick to. It became a music for self-appointed cognoscenti and illuminati - not literate enough to know classical music, but wishing to be above \\"art crowd\\". All these virtuoso ventures to my most humble opinion cover one simple thing - \\"Yes\\" plays instruments, not music. Meditating with the candles was a good try, but the inspiration obviously got lost in the darkness, while the candles should have been used for better purposes. Composing is not their forte, all these artificial complexities cover a sheer misery of melody. It was a good show, I really loved it - time to face the truth. I got rid of my \\"Yes\\", and listen mainly to \\"Rare Bird\\", \\"Frumpy Live\\" and - if you want progressive - Czeslaw Niemen. Until now I keep some LPs - because of Roger Dean.<br />P.S. By the way, [[ASIN:B000BYRAAS Touch]] - most humbly, but strongly recommended - did it all in 1969. Actually, pre-dated and blew away (if given a chance) many of British prog-rock peers.k peers.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|There is nothing that I can add to the various positive reviews that have been done.  This is an excellent selection.  The music selections were great, and the documentary footage was informative.  I wish there were more.      I don't know why this item has been discontinued.  I would have purchased it on Amazon had it been available, but I saw it at Blockbuster video for $45 and purchased it there.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Of the five Beatles albums I've listened to, this one felt like it had the best balance between all four musicians. I mean, if you look at the White Album, they all contributed a lot, but things will look like that when you have 30 songs together. But just on the 14 tracks here, you see remarkable accomplishments by all of them. Obviously Ringo is limited, but his drumming always helps a song and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is one of his more famous and better vocal performances. The song's strange and a bit childish, but it's still a classic. There's quite a strong concentration of George to be found, as he opens the album with the clever and catchy \\"Taxman\\", and soon thereafter adds \\"Love You Too\\", which has a similar eastern feel to \\"Within You Without You\\" though I dare say it's a better song. \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is more forgettable but not bad. I've noticed that it's not hard to tell John and Paul apart, but does anyone agree that George and Ringo sound like them in their deeper registers, respectively? Oh well.    Paul has sort of a tendency to do bouncy, upbeat songs that elicit feelings of cheesiness as much as genuine affection, but I think Revolver has some of his strongest work. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is an obvious good one, helping signal the band's transition from pop to something much more interesting, and is still deeply enjoyable to listen to. \\"For No One\\" is another particularly good composition, and the rest of his contributions are at the least solid, impeccably crafted songs. John has always stuck out to me a bit more than the rest, and he fails to disappoint here yet again. I could take or leave \\"Doctor Robert\\", but \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is one of the best songs of his that sounds very much like just a Beatles song, and he caps off the album with \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which apparently attempts to recreate the experience of taking acid and manages to be quite trippy without ever sacrificing its success as an enjoyable song. He has a couple more tracks which, like Paul's are of particular consistent quality. Revolver is one of the most acclaimed and probably important albums ever released, and while I can't say it blew me away, it's still impressive throughout and frequently steps into moments of brilliance.
B002HWRZH0|4.0|First.. I have to say I really hate that J. J. Abrams decided to create a \\"parallel universe\\" Star Trek where he could just do whatever he wanted.  It was a cop-out.  He should have just done a reboot/retcon and told the old trekkies to lump it.<br /><br />That said - this is the first Star Trek movie in probably over 10 years that didn't just completely disgust me.  I enjoyed watching it.  The TNG movies were all abominations and slowpaced and plodding.  At least this was a fun ride from start to end.  For that it's worth watching and worth having in my movie collection.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael does a great job here. As a fan of him, I felt like an outsider the first few times I heard the album, mostly because many of the songs I hadn't heard before or was familiar with. However, now I think it ranks up there with his other successful albums, and without any questionable tracks, like his last album had (Me and Mrs. Jones, etc). He's as smooth as ever, and his songs are full of his youthful energy and romance. My favorite is \\"Haven't met you yet\\" which is downright fun, especially to sing to. My wife would want me to say that the sleeve has some very good pictures of him too.
1594488843|5.0|Tomorrow begins the next exciting decade of the 21st Century, so there is no better time than now for Dan Pink to grace us with his next book, DRIVE. In this book, he makes us think, really hard, about who and what we are. Best of all, he helps us understand about why we do things.     In DRIVE, Dan proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what motivates us, and even more importantly, hands us the elusive keys to happiness, which he argues is within the grasp of everyone. DRIVE makes a very convincing argument that we all have the tools, inside us, to achieve everything we want in life,  thanks to our special intrinsic drivers.    So do yourself a huge favor, and make DRIVE the first thing you read in 2010. One last thing. Don't forget to focus on Part 3, which is a complete Toolkit on how to make your life at work and home flourish, for you, and for your fellow employees, family, and friends as well. Drive on!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This video features beautiful singers who have absolutely spellbinding sweet and smooth voices. They sing songs both familiar and unfamiliar to the American audience. The fiddler is shockingly good, mostly because besides sawing out ultra-fast jigs, she almost never looks at her fiddle and she's usually doing an energetic dance routine too. Overall, a gorgeous show, leaving you feel refreshed and cheered.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|While this book had an amazing plot, suspense, action, and intrigue, the ending fell short. It seemed as if Dan Brown felt his book was getting too long. The book climaxed and ended within what seemed was a matter of minutes. I was disappointed in the ending, however the rest of the book was fantastic.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I love Brendan Fraser and I think he is one of the rare genius' of our time. That said this movie is just pure fun. I loved it and had a great time and will watch it again.
076781326X|5.0|I loved this musical when I first saw it way back in 1969! I was just a teenager then. I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old nephew.  Don't know if he has watched it yet or not.
B002UXRH10|5.0|It's hard to follow up your highest grossing album of your career. It seems Rihanna has taken a darker approach in her follow up to Good Girl Gone Bad. This isn't the same album, and it'll be hard for people to realize that Jay-Z's protégé just isn't the same. From the first single Russian Roulette, it's obvious that there's an emotional sound that was absent before. The vibrant club sound that made for fun summer hits is replaced with a darker sound, a darker tone that may not be as radio-friendly, but may be more critically appraised. Personal favorite is Rockstar 101, and I'd like to see some more rock-influenced tracks in the future.
0375424474|5.0|I love this book.  Shubin has put quality time into it - and it shows.<br /><br />I go back and re-read parts of it over and over.<br /><br />I find it refreshing that Shubin doesn't try and take credit where it isn't due.  It's a special book and everyone can learn something from it.<br /><br />Neil:  I anxiously await your next book.  Thank you!
0671578855|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Lois Bujold's writing and of the Vorkosigan series in particular, and I think this may be my favourite title in the series (although with such competition it would be awfully difficult to choose).  Don't be put off by the awful cover art - it's really  not a Harlequin romance!    Ms Bujold's books are always well written, with meticulous world-building and really rich characterization - the characters in this series really live for me.  The early books in the series were essentially space opera, but the characters and the world have built in complexity as the series has progressed and this book defies insertion in to any neat genre pigeon-hole.  There's very little space opera in this one (which I suspect accounts for the very few negative reviews here, which I presume are largely from teenage boys who missed the space battles and didn't really get the humour).  It's part science fiction, part political thriller, part romance, part comedy of manners, and wholly entertaining - I just couldn't put it down once I started.  There are some definite echoes of Jane Austen in the love story (oh, the letter!), including the deliciously subtle wit and observation of character.    The book contains one of my favourite scenes from any book - the Dinner Party - which had me laughing out loud and re-reading it repeatedly, and the climax scene in the Council of Counts had me cheering out loud.    I can't reccomend this series, and this book in particular, too highly.  This is science fiction for grown-ups.  A terrific read.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Whether you appreciate the genius of Murnau or not, the new Kino transfer is the best I've ever seen.  There is a clarity of detail I've only imagined before.  I wish the same transfer were available on Blu-Ray.  Oh well, maybe one day.<br /><br />My only complaint about this version is the altogether extraneous second disc which merely includes the same transfer but with the original German title cards in place.  The set is still worth the extra money regardless.  I imagine Kino included the second disc so they could charge more for the set without getting complaints from the casual buyer about the price.  But do casual buyers purchase Kino DVDs?<br /><br />If you're looking for the absolute best presentation of this landmark film, get the \\"Ultimate Two-Disc Edition\\" from Kino.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're simply looking for a decent copy of the film to watch, the Image Entertainment version is good and it includes a very informative commentary track by Lokke Heiss.  I have owned six or seven versions of this seminal film over the years and these two are the only ones I still own.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Awesome controller but wish Sony had this on day 1 with the PS3's launch. It works with Playstation, Playstation 2, and Playstation 3 games that support the rumble feature. One thing I will notice about this controller is that its a little heavier than the SixAxis controller which felt light since it lacked the rumble feature. The only problem I with the DS3 controller is that the R2 button trigger got stuck in the PS3 controller. I only had the controller for a year and this happens. I take good care of my controllers but luckily ordered one from Amazon for $42 since it was 50% off video-game accessories. I still have my SixAxis and have yet to have problems with it from stop working.
0756405890|2.0|I am by no means a writer or an editor. So I can't talk about how this book should have been written or if the author needed an editor like so many other reviewers have pointed out. One thing I am, is a reader.     I picked up this book at an airport bookseller on the recommendation of the counter person. I was on vacation and had just finished KJ Anderson's Saga of the Seven Suns and needed a \\"filler\\" book until I got home. That exactly what this book is, filler.       Plain and simple Mr. Author: Give me some story. It was as though he was trying to fit in every character trait and story from 20 Fiest novels into one 700 page book. I read the whole book, and I didn't HATE it. I just wish that something, ANYTHING, would have happened.        In the authors defense there were some shining spots, I thought the \\"sympathy\\" AKA Magic breakdown was a cool idea. And in many books there is always the wise old wizard (Gandolf, Macros etc...), but you never know where he came from or what he did to get to be a wise old wizard. Here you learn a little...a little.     All in all, this book is MEH. I won't run right out and grab the second one when it drops, but I will most likely pick it up if I have nothing else to read and it is on sale
0312360258|2.0|I like many others devoured the Twilight Saga in days and couldn't get enough so I went on a search to find something similar. Let me tell you The House of Night- Marked is nothing like Twilight. Let me be honest and say I have only read about half of the book. I made the mistake of asking for the book set for Christmas and started reading a few days ago. I am only on page 160 and can tell you this is the worst Young Adult book I have ever read. Truthfully the plot is not so bad. A vampire finishing school is a excellent premise but really I wouldn't think this book was about vampires if not for the main character saying so. To me this book has more of a Wiccan and witchcraft feel than vampire with the Pagan religion and worship of goddesses.<br /><br />The thing that makes it difficult for me to continue on is the writing. It is beyond clear that the author is trying WAY too hard to sound like a teenager. I am only 22 and can tell you that I did not speak the way Zoey and her friends do when I was in high school. The use of the words \\"poopie\\" and \\"boob\\" only tells the readers that this book was written by someone over the age of 40. I absolutely find it mind boggling that P.C. Cast's daughter who is a young adult herself helped her mother write this to sound more like a teenager. Another issue I have is the excessive use of pop culture references. Paris Hilton, Shania Twain, Kenny Chesney, Pamela Anderson, Vin Diesel, Banana Republic, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Starbucks are just a few to name.<br /><br />The characters are flat and non memorable. I find the main character Zoey whiny and annoying. She is constantly mentioning how she was an outcast yet she has the hottest guy at the school interested in her.<br /><br />I will finish Marked and the other three books in the set just because I have them and they are a quick read. I am disappointed because I truly thought this series would give me the Twilight fix I had been craving. Next time I will pay more attention to the reviews.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I enjoyed this film more than any of the other Potter films, with the possible exception of Azkaban. Like that film, it has numerous departures from the book, but viewed as part of the series of films (and NOT as a shoe-in for the book in the series of books), it works very well. I know that Rowling had approved the scripts to these films as they were made, so I'm sure that she always had a clear understanding of the consequences of any omissions (and additions) made to the events in terms of the subsequent films. So far, it has worked just fine. Are the negative Potter diehards worried that all these changes will somehow inevitably add up to a bad movie version of the \\"Deathly Hallows\\"?    I very much enjoyed the humor. Scenes such as the tribute to Aragog were hilarious, as well as the little touches - Ron sitting between Harry and Ginny at the Burrow, and Harry being informed of Vane's love potion plans by Hermione, and the brewing of \\"Living Death\\"! Hermione's comments about Harry \\"enjoying his dessert\\", and her trying to explain to Ron how he split with Lavender during his recovery from poisoning (\\"I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation\\") are also hilariously low key. Lavender's attentions to Ron are comical, and deliberately pitched as almost painful. The effects are convincing, and the actors have hit their stride. There are lots of little details to keep the films interesting for multiple viewings.
B00169N0BK|4.0|Quick and dirty what I do and don't like in this little device:<br /><br />The most important positive thing about it is... that it works. Which only at first may seem to be obvious but from my previous experience with different color calibrators it not always is so. And I don't mean that you can't calibrate the monitor using them. You can, but it closer resemble engineering process than quick and painful task you can do every other Monday to make sure your monitor profile is up to date. With ColorMunki the bundled software does that job perfectly. It checks your monitor's current setting, asks you to adjust contrast or brightness level if needed (usually you have to set them during initial calibration, then they don't change that much if you don't touch them) and then does it's job in a matter of seconds. No unneeded options (those are hidden if you really want to play), just few clicks and your monitor is done.<br /><br />What I do not like about it? The most annoying thing is the device's design. It's built as a rotating ring/button/circle inside bigger enclosure. You're supposed to turn the whole inside ring between different steps of calibration process. The problem is that one side of that ring actually works as a button activating currently selected function of the device. I find it very difficult to turn the ring without pressing the button. You have to constantly remember about it otherwise the software will try to start it's job while the device is obviously not ready causing errors to pop up. The other thing I've notice is that it's very important to reset any possible monitor settings to the factory defaults, otherwise you may get strange results. That thing was actually mentioned on the X-Rite website's but I've read that after I was done with the job.<br /><br />In the end it took me less that 45 minutes to calibrate all four monitors I have. Considering price - well worth it.
B001TOD92C|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Mickey Rourke. I always thought he was more sideshow buffoon than legitimate talent. That he squandered whatever skill he had with forays into boxing and his battles with various toxins is irrelevant. The plain truth is that there were no movies where I thought he played outside of himself and I was never impressed with the guy's work. I still feel that way. Nonetheless, The Wrestler is the perfect vehicle for him. This is acting as reality show and Rourke consumes the role of Ram, the washed up wrestler. The wheezing, grimacing, limping, pondering, seething, self-destructive role and actor often seem one and the same. Rourke pulls off the performance of a lifetime, largely because he is given a role so close to his own reality. What variances the original script had from Rourke's life were augmented at his request to better complete the picture. Don't misunderstand me; Mickey Rourke isn't alone in the Hollywood casting agency of stereotyped personalities, endlessly repeating their signature moves. Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino are all great actors, but all-too-often they fall back on their bag of tricks. Rourke isn't nearly as talented as those giants, but it doesn't matter. Like all the legends of screen, he found the definitive signature role.<br />Marisa Tomei was the real gem of the story for me, however. Tomei showed courage in playing a character that is nude in most of her scenes and she delivers a brilliant performance. Enduring the merciless taunts or the hurtful disinterest from the crowd she attempts to entertain with the most basic tools, she demonstrates the vulnerability and fragile nature of such a career. Both Rourke and Tomei are performers past their shelf life because their success is based so exclusively on the acceptance of their bodies by a fastidious public. These are people trying to find themselves between the persona under which they perform and the reality that confronts them when the spotlight is shut off. Rourke played a role that mirrored his own near-tragic career path, but Marisa Tomei is the real actor here, playing a character that few actresses would have the fearlessness to accept and one that it is safe to say is far from her personal life.<br />The Wrestler is an exceptional study in damaged individuals who lead lives far from the norm. The problem, as Rourke's Ram puts it, is that the real world doesn't care about them beyond the stage. Both suffer in their personal lives because they can't balance one with the other. Robin can't stop being Ram, to the detriment of his relationship with his daughter and Pam can't put aside Cassidy long enough to distinguish between the customer and the man who truly cares for her. The ending is expertly ambiguous because who can say what these sad characters will do next? It's just as easy to imagine the worst as it is to imagine a happy ending. And that's the reality of life.yed a role that mirrored his own near-tragic career path, but Marisa Tomei is the real actor here, playing a character that few actresses would have the fearlessness to accept and one that it is safe to say is far from her personal life.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|Very disappointing. It had the potential to be really scary -- but failed miserably along the way. Micah's lame and insensitive behavior only serves to interrupt the flow of the film. Choppy and slow paced, it was a real bummer for this horror film fan.
0061124958|5.0|My 3rd grade teacher read this book to our class a very long time ago...it had a great character message then and it still does.  I'm glad they made a movie (or two or three) of the book, but I fear it has kept some kids from reading the book and they just don't realize what they are missing!  That is why I just gave my niece the book for Christmas.  Can't wait to hear what she thinks.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I found the first 2/3 of the movie very entertaining with interesting  dialogue and action . The end seemed rather contrived and not fluid .    Throughout the series Snape has gone from bad guy to good guy to bad guy again and  somehow it didn't seem plausible anymore to me that he should be the bad guy .  Just doesn't feel right . Maybe it would have been OK if it was presented  better but seemed all artificially pasted together .     Was also seeing too  many parallels to Star Wars - Obi Wan - Darth Vader .  I haven't read the books so I can't compare .
B000OQF6N6|1.0|The Smashing Pumpkins were meant to be an incredible band since they started things up in 1995 with Mellon Collie, but unfortunely this is not the case with this awful album (mediocre songs, forgetable tunes and lame lyrics) Honestly there's nothing much I can say about the album but there's A LOT I can say on why this is a bad album. For the Pumpkins things started falling apart when Jimmy Chamberlain was fired, D'Arcy left the band as well as James Iha. And everything... and I mean, EVERYTHING had to do with Corgan's huge ego and his closed minded attitude toward the rest of the band members. Musically he's a genius (Siamese dream (1993), Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness (1995), Adore (1998) and even the masterpiece of \\"Machina/the machines of God\\" (2000)) unfortunely, as what is expected to happen to every genius that gets lost on his own world without listening nor taking anything from anyone in the \\"outside\\" world, he was left alone and without ANY doubt, the other band members were his best options when it came to translate ideas into music (Chamberlin's drums on songs like \\"ode to anyone\\" (Mellon collie-1995), Iha's guitars on songs like \\"Zero\\", \\"Bullet with...\\" (Mellon collie-1995) and even \\"disarm\\" (siamese dream-1993) and Arcy's bass in her wonderful performance on the song \\"Raindrops and sunshowers\\" (Machina-2000). I hardly doubt that Corgan will ever captured the aura on his music the way he did with the original band members and I also hardly doubt that he will ever see the guilt he has always had on the Pumpkins's end.<br /><br />Funnily enough (and as a HUGE R.E.M. fan that I am) once Corgan said in an interview back in the 90's that he didn't like R.E.M. and he had issues with Michael Stipe (lead singer). Well, what happened here is that his ego had this problem of seeing a succesful band for so many years together but what he never understood is that this is no magic at all. If you're decided to keep a band together you have to go beyond the music, being open to new ideas, respect your band members ideologies and listen to them. So, what is the conclusion here: R.E.M.= 14 albums recorded and keep on counting, 30 years together already and yet, one of the most humble bands I've ever seen. The Smashing pumpkins= 5 albums recorded (with original band members), 10 years together split and then came back with an uncertain future now and yet, Corgan wants to keep his dream alive as well as his ego.ing open to new ideas, respect your band members ideologies and listen to them.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|Pues esta es una bella presentación de los disco en usb, sin embargo el precio me parece excesivo para los fans quienes ya hemos comprado este año tanto la caja estereo como la mono.  ¿Cómo es posible que esta manzanita con las canciones comprimidas en mp3 cueste más que la caja estereo?    Definitivamente es un artículo que todo Beatlemano debe tener, pero tambien definitivamente es un abuso.  Yo en lo personal esperaré a que se lance una versión en otro formato con mejor calidad de audio quizás pronto tengamos el Ipod Beatle.    Saludos y feliz 2010.  Happy 2010 for everyone.

This was one I had to see in theaters as opposed to waiting to see it in my dvd collections.  I can tell you after just seeing it I have not been dissappointed.  It lived up to my expectations, jazz music and all.  Can't say I predicted the ending with any accuracy.  But well worth seeing if you are a kid, or an adult that still watches cartoons as much as I do.  No spoilers here.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I had high hopes for this movie and I wasn't disappointed. It delivered in the creepy night vision camera look similar to ghost hunters and other paranormal tv shows. The story was slow to build but started rather quickly with the purchase of the camera to \\"catch\\" the paranormal activity. We don't get to see why he needed to buy the camera in the first place. So that was kind of weird.<br /><br />Once the story got going, it was truly creepy with a couple of \\"whoa\\" moments. The alternate ending on the disc was interesting. The one thing I have to give props to in this movie is the lead actress` ability to hurl a blood curdling scream. Lord have mercy can that girl lay down a scream track. Believable to the core.<br /><br />overall a must see movie and then you can judge for yourself if it's a keep or delete. I rented it and watched it. I doubt i'll buy the blu-ray until it's under $10 down the line. There isn't much replay value in horror movies and this one is no exception. But be sure to see it at least once.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|After the series, in my opinion, meandered lost fashion for the last couple of seasons, the 5th Season reinvigorated my interest.  The finale was superb and left me wanting more and simply waiting for the final season to start.  Simply great television.
0394721772|5.0|I admit the book is not for those that are beginning to learn to cook but for the ones that have some type of experience cooking already.  I enjoy reading this cooking book, I owned the two volumes.  I have done many of the receipices already and some of them although tasted good when I first made them, they weren't perfect.  So you may said, it takes practice, practice, practice to make it perfect.  If you enjoy changellenges and are not scared of elaborated meals, this a great book for you.
1615232168|5.0|This is nearly as good as the Da Vinci Code.  Holding my attention as I read it.  Got it in large print so easier to read.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|This movie will have all other directors and producers asking themselves \\"How can we ever compare?\\"  It is simply that good.
0307341569|5.0|I started this book and realized pretty quickly that I  did not like any of the people in it.  I almost stopped after page 40 something because it just seemed so incredibly dark.  I am very glad I kept going.  This is a great read.  The characters are compelling (sort of like watching a major train wreck) and the author does a good job of escalating suspense throughout the book.  The writing seems so effortless, and unlike some of the other reviewers I  enjoyed her time and perspective shifts.  I felt that they added to the tension and kept things going at just the perfect edge of your seat, grind your teeth pace. I won't spoil the ending, suffice it to say that I didn't see it coming and even though I'm still not sure if I like Libby Day, I understand her a whole lot better.  This book is probably not for everyone, but if you have a taste for midwestern crime, this one is particulary sinister.
1400031354|5.0|I love these stories. They are warm-hearted, but intriguing. They are good to read for when you only have one day to indulge in a book.  I ended up checking it out from the library instead of purchasing it. The time:$ value is too low.
0843178396|5.0|A set of books that give me as much fun as my four year old gets for reading at bedtime. Simple stories, great artwork. Everything I remember from being read them as a child in England. For $4 a bok they really can't be beat (+ buy 3 get one free!). If you hven't given them a look you really ought to.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is quite possibly the most flat out beautiful TV show ever made.  You can quibble with some of the episodes, some of the acting, etc, but that goes for any TV show.  Legend of the Seeker has enough quality writing and acting to be enjoyable, while the action and sheer beauty of the production just push it over the top into greatness.  The show is so lovable and fun-loving that you find its flaws almost adorable.  One of my favorite series of all time.
0307474275|4.0|OK, so it's Dan Brown and not likely to go down as a \\"literary masterpiece\\" but, you know what, it's a decent read and a great \\"beach book\\" when you're on holiday and watching the sun come up and go down. For all those whining about it being inaccurate and silly; try doing better yourself. Any book (that isn't Harry Potter) that has people reading and talking about it can't be all bad can it?
0763637084|1.0|We love Charlie and Lola, and the book itself is very cute, however, when my daughter opened it for Christmas, it seemed like it had been used already. All the little pull tags were wrinkled and disconnected from the paper and Charlie's head was off.  Also on the last page the planets were not connected. I don't know if this is a manufacturing problem or an Amazon problem.  I have not found anywhere to ask this question...I don't think I can send it back as it has already been opened, but I do want Amazon to know I am disappointed in this item.
0451529308|5.0|This was one of those books that I hated to see end...but the \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" brought us to some closure.  I recommend this book to every young girl to read and soak up it's good morals, Christian wisdom and thrill of adventure in the world of the March family!
B002VPE1AM|3.0|First, let me say that I enjoyed this movie in spite of myself.  I had even hesitated to go see it.  There was so much that seemed wrong, including the fact that most of Hollywood gets science fiction wrong.  They just don't know what to do with it, other than make grandiose and visually spectacular films that almost always lose sight of the essence of the original story.      Second, \\"Avatar\\" turned out to be what I feared most:  a collection of cliches and SF stories that have been around for decades.  For instance, the idea of a human's essence occupying another form in a hostile world while the real body lies sleeping in a seemingly safe environment (my own short story, \\"Jessica's Body\\" is just one of many).  Or the human who is part of a force that is supposed to help conquer an alien world and in the end turns into one of the aliens, or whose heart is turned by the plight both of the world and the aliens (e.g., Judgment on Janus by Andre Norton or Enemy Mine by Barry Longyear).    Third, there are the noble savage cliches that have been around for decades in the movies, for centuries in literature.  The film \\"Dances with Wolves\\" comes to mind, of course.  But there is also \\"Last of the Dogmen\\" with Tom Berenger, less popular, but more interesting in several ways.  This goes hand-in-hand with saving the world from industrialization and abuse, found even in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.    All told, there is nothing really original in this movie:  Even the 3-D format, animation, mix of animation and live action.  Nothing.  Yet, it is a beautiful film, the world so different, and the ways of the people so appealing.  Even if their story has been done many times before, it seems that each generation must renew the hope and idealism expressed for our own world, ourselves, and the future.  Americans are known for favoring the underdog, even if it's counter to our human goals.  We admire and favor those who have the courage to stand up against greater odds.So, it's easy to get sucked into such a story when told so realistically and beautifully.  No, there is nothing new in \\"Avatar,\\" if one looks back on literature and film of the past.  It is a retelling of a story for this generation and I'm glad I saw it.
0736063684|4.0|You're definitely going to know the names of all the muscles in the human body after studying this book a while. Exercises using weights and machines are explained, and the different muscle groups that each exercise employs are shown on very finely-detailed drawings. I think the drawings are the best feature of this book; all are basically black-and-white images, but the muscles used are shown in red. While I would have liked more detail on exactly how to perform each exercise for arms, shoulders, chest, back, etc., I like how the author indicates that certain muscles are worked harder for some variations of the exercise than others. For example, the standard bench press works the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, anterior deltoid, and a couple other muscle groups. But if you narrow the length of the bar between your hands, you will \\"isolate the central part of the pectoralis\\" rather than the lateral portion. Good to know! The only way to improve this book is to add more exercises, as not all of us have access to free weights or machines.
0307582884|5.0|State of the art storytelling with plenty of suspense, intrigue, edge of the seat action sequences, and one of the most unique concepts I've seen for a long time!  This might be a little scary for younger readers, but I strongly recommend it for anyone 12 or older.      The audio production is also very well done. Seriously, if you don't read or listen to this, you're missing out!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|predictable but entertaining!!  My daughter and I enjoyed the movie. Sex is talked about twice and I think they could have got the same results with implication. I was not upset by the wording, but a little uneasy about my 12 Yr. old daughter hearing it. Other than those two very short dialogs the rest of the movie was great.  I would recommend viewing!  I am a DAD and it is a chick flick, but a good one.  The girls that play Grahams daughters steal the show.
B00005N56Y|5.0|Clifford Curzon was a very reluctant recording artist. In his limited discography, I can think of no performance that is less than first rate. Amongst all the composers that he performed, it is Mozart and Schubert that found him at his most sympathetic. These composers suited his understated, sensitive and unflashy personality.<br /><br />What a treasure chest this reissue is; five late Mozart Piano Concerti at a reduced price. Curzon is on top form and his performances approach perfection. It all sounds so easy, natural, authentic and unforced. But that is one of the hallmarks of greatness; to make the difficult sound easy. Curzon is fortunate to have one great (Britten) and one very good (Kertesz) conductor as accompanists. The vintage Decca sound is an additional bonus. Indispensable.
0143115014|1.0|What a smarmy and mean-spirited book . . .  Very personal reviews and little substance. They went on and on about YSL 'Opium' being 'so over' and everybody in the universe is tired of it - really? Most women (of all ages, by the way) I know adore it. They also stated that Estee Lauder's 'White Linen' was a masterpiece . . .    Read their so-called 'review' of Britney Spear's 'Curious' - then you judge. These authors (I use the term loosely) remind me of two gossipy junior high school girls - wannabes that are miserable with their lot.
B001IMFHVG|5.0|What a treat to have a visual/audio document of Artur Rubinstein performing in a live recital. Additionally we are fortunate to have him playing Chopin, his speciality. Rubinstein, although he was 77 years young at the time, displays no technical difficulty with the music. Of course he plays Chopin to the manner born; he hardly seems to build up a sweat and seems to be having fun with \\"his audience\\".<br /><br />Although this concert was held in 1964, the filming is limited but quite satisfactory. The sound, apart from some deterioration towards the end, is also acceptable. Reading Rubinstein's memoirs, this concert is mentioned briefly and without any indication that it was particularly legendary (as claimed on the DVD title). Nevertheless it is fabulous document of aristocratic pianism and should not be missed.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I saw my coworkers playing the duo version of this game at work one day.  Then this one was in the amazon gold box deal for $9.99.  I purchased it and tried it out with the girlfriend two nights ago.  We became addicted immediately.  We then took it to a house party on new year's eve.  It kept us busy for hours!  Lots of fun.  You start off from your corner and try to expand toward the center, claiming your territory and, at the same time, try to defend yourself from being blocked by your opponents.  This game is fit for all ages, from kids to seniors.  It makes you use your brain and keep it active.  Try to think ahead; try to think what pieces you want to place in the open spaces.  Think about where to put your pieces to expand your colors or prevent your opponents from surrounding you.  I think we got a few people addicted to this game last night.  This is a great buy!  There are 21 small plastic game pieces for each of the 4 colors.  If you're not careful, it might be easy to lose a piece and I wonder if the plastic can be easily cracked.  Other than that, there are no concerns.
0375701427|1.0|Having been made aware that this book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature, I was looking forward to a good weekend read. I typically prefer to read books that have received professional awards as I do not have much time to spare, and I am grateful that others can filter the 'chaf' from the 'wheat'.    What a disappointment this book was. Like so much that I find in modern 'literature', while there is definitely a 'kern' of a story here, the book would have benefitted greatly by a professional edit. It is present state, I would never have allowed it to be published. While I can understand, for example, the author's intention to create a particular atmosphere using relevent descriptions and jargon, we do not need to suffer 40 page long passages describing the production of leatherware... it deters our attention from the essence of the story rather than convince us of the intended atmosphere.     Also, another typical characteristic of moderen literature as exemplified in this book, after making a point #or creating a particular insight#, the author is constantly knocking us on the head with the same repedative point, thereby insulting our intelligence.     This book is not worth wasting one's time until it is edited down to roughly a 60 page novelette. It is worth noting that Mr. Roth's more recent litererary efforts have indeed observed such spatial limitations. I guess he is learning.    Want a better read? I am now reading Thomas Mann's 'Doctor Faustus'. What a masterpiece in comparison to the above work. While it has in excess of 550 pages, each page is rich in material #there is more to find in one chapter of this book than in the entire 'American Pastoral'# and we our intelligence is not repeatedly insulted.     In refection, there is very little 'meat on these bones', and if one were to remove all the useless digressions, the book would not be worth one's time. I think the fact that 'American Pastoral' has been grated the Pulitzer Prize exemplifies the present sad state of American literature, however I hope that I am wrong.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|whne i was starting to get a the end of this book i was crying soooo much. This book is so strong it brings me to tears,laugh,smiling, and feel the love of a girl and the Wolf Boy. If you read my note i hope u give this book a chance cause its just so wonderful.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|Except for the song, \\"Man of the Hour\\" on this album, the haunting, aching quality of Norah Jones's lounge singer's voice is absent from this album. Like most popular singers before her, if she can capture an emotional tone with her voice, she can also capture her audience.  If that emotional rapport is absent, the album is only on a par with everything else out there.  This emotional rasp is what Billie Holliday captured so well, the singer to whom Jones is often compared.  Jones does grab hold of it on \\"Man of the Hour\\" and that song will be remaining on my ipod. I can't really recommend someone lay down hard cash for this album. It is a far, far cry from her breakthrough album \\"Come Away With Me.\\" On that album, every song competed to tear your heart out of you.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Funny timeless classic, Chevy Chase at his best with the Hilarious Randy Quaid!  Great cast!  Amazon seller fast shipping and professional!
0786868724|5.0|The author briefly but skillfully tells the story of two clerics, one a Jew and the other a Christian, and in the telling he finds that \\". . . a divine spark lies inside each one of us, and that spark may one day save the world.\\"  The author clearly, in the end, believes that God is good.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|Wonder new style in movie making, great for kids, good moral but not true to the spirit of a Christian Christmas as much.  Still, nice for family.  Fast shipping from this Amazon seller and in perfect condition.
B002QYSZBO|1.0|[[ASIN:B00129JSMY KISS KISS BANG BANG WIDESCREEN EDITION]]<br /><br />What a waste of my time.  Terrible acting on Downey's part!  I think this was the same script used for Lethal Weapon.  I hope Downey is better in Sherlock Holmes. A total waste of my $2.99 fee for watching on Video on Demand.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|For an alleged $15,000, filmmaker Oren Peli has taken the concept of a horror film using \\"found footage\\" and managed to succeed where the Blair Witch Project failed miserably.<br /><br />The movie focuses on an engaged couple, Micah and Katie, as they try to get to the bottom of the weird noises and events that Katie has been experiencing since a house fire when she was a kid.  Micah documents their house over a series of days using his high definition video camera.  As the events get stranger, Katie gets more and more concerned that Micah is angering whatever is behind these strange occurrences.<br /><br />Peli does a great job of amping up the tension, but can't deliver a payoff comparable to what led up to it.  But the movie itself is excellent for what it is.<br /><br />Note to DVD viewers.  The sound mix is muddled at times.  Turn on the subtitles, you'll be glad you did.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Inside Man is a great movie. Fast action, great acting, fantastic plot.  I highly recommend this movie.
0385504225|4.0|My biggest complaint with Dan Brown's novels is that they are all incredibly formulaic. I literally think Brown uses the same outline for all of his books and just drops in different characters, cities, and mysterious codes. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is no exception. This time, Harvard professor and renowned symbolygist Robert Langdon is summoned to Washington, D.C., at the request of an old friend. However, another force is at work behind the scenes, and Robert soon finds himself at the center of yet another mystery that may result in the revelation of information that will change the world.<br /><br />Despite his lack of plot originality, Brown's novels are all incredibly entertaining and intriguing, and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is no exception. This was a very enjoyable book to read, although I figured out much of the ending in advance just by recalling different elements of Brown's previous books. I was impressed by the twist the book seemed to take with about 100 or so pages to go, but then the author took the easy way out, losing a bit of my respect. Still, I may be critical, but I'm also a fan of these books because they're suspenseful and a lot of fun to read. Fans of \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" will not be disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|i was very excited to read this book. unfortunately it was produced to generate profit without botherig with a real story. the ending went on forever in a religious rant totally disconected from the plot. no more dan brown stories for me without reading a few reviews.
B00127RAJY|5.0|A couple of months ago, some friends on Facebook posted a status about working out with \\"The Shred\\" and I was curious. I had never heard of Jillian Michaels and her 30 Day Shred. I'm on a tight budget so my workouts are based on exercise DVDs and running. I was burned out with running and bored with my Pilates workouts so I ordered The Shred. It took me about 50 days to complete the three levels of the 30 Day Shred but I can see and feel the difference. The exercises are creative and fast-paced. I love this workout because the intervals are short and the workout is complete in 30 minutes. When I first started this workout, I was able to keep up by telling myself, no matter how difficult the exercise was, I could surely keep it up for 3 minutes(strength)or 2 minutes(cardio)or 1 minute(abs). And when you start this workout, there may be some moments when you must focus on the short duration of the set. I've muttered some expletives under my breath as I try to keep up with the workout but this is more than okay with Jillian. She gives you permission for screaming and grunting to get through this workout and although you may not need this encouragement, Jillian's motivating energy feels authentic. This is absolutely the best 30 minute workout I have ever done.
0061766089|3.0|At first the book seemed promising and it hints and lots of good things.  But like so many other books in the business/management sphere, when it comes down to down-to-earth advice on how to carry out these changes, the information is just not there.<br /><br />If you are looking for high-level ideas, this books is not so bad.  But if you want to be sure you can really do the things that the book hopes to promise--well, we need some extras not yet included in the book.
0545140315|5.0|This book was a fun read. It is really about not losing yourself in others and about being true to yourself. I definately recommend it to anyone.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|this book is amazing it has eerything i loved it if u want to read something then read this LOVED IT
B000683VI4|5.0|Movie was interesting and revealing for a love story.  Not a bad 'chick flick' even if your a guy.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|I'll help you out. It's tricky, you may get dizzy and need to nap a while. The movies you mention that are all region, state \\"All Region\\" in the description. I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but I'm figuring that if it doesn't say \\"All Region\\", it's going to be US region encoded as you're on amazon.com. Buy from amazon.co.uk if you're worried because, and it's obvious you don't know this, Blu-Ray regions are NOT designated 1, 2, 3 etc, but are split into only 3 regions labeled A, B and C. B being Europe.    In future, don't rate a movie lower simply because you have no idea what you're talking about.
B00000G6NI|5.0|(This review applies to the CD version.)  Ten stars for the music, five stars for the remastering, but zero for the remixing.  Like all of Rory's albums, this is a great one. If I were to choose one as his best, this would be it.  The LP version of this album was my introduction to Rory, and it instantly made me a fan.  Rory was in a class by himself, and his talent was on a higher level than anything I had heard before.  This album is a classic and is one of my all-time favorites.  Rory displays his talent on the mandolin and blues harp, and he creates riffs and solos from his Stratocaster as if it were a part of him.  Every track is outstanding.  While it is more rock-oriented than other releases, Rory still stays true to his blues roots.        BUT -- the remixes on this CD are NOT the original LP versions.  A few differences are slight and merely annoying, but unfortunately some are great, to the detriment of the music.  From what I have learned, Rory's brother Donal entrusted to recording engineers Colin Fairley and Tony Arnold the task of remastering the album for CD release after Rory's death.  For whatever reason, they also remixed it to the extent that the content and sound of most of the tracks have been very noticeably altered.  A reading of the credits and the third paragraph of the enclosed liner notes will reveal that Rory did not make these remixes, and they did not have his approval -- they were made two years after his death.  They are instead the misguided work of Fairley and Arnold.             Here is a partial list of the ways the CD versions are different from the LP originals:    Shin Kicker - ending doesn't fade out completely like the original (one of only two instances in which the CD version may be as good as or better than the original).    Brute Force & Ignorance - different notes sung at 2:32 through 2:33.     Cruise on Out - different word sung at 2:54 (\\"step\\" instead of \\"groove\\"); ending begins to fade out, unlike the original.    Cloak & Dagger - different mix on guitar overdub.    Overnight Bag - the CD version may be better than the original.  This track is a beautiful Celtic-flavored ballad with acoustic guitar overdubs.  This version has a line added at 2:56 through 3:12 that had been omitted in the original, making it slightly longer.  No other noticeable changes, thankfully.    Shadow Play - echo has been added to vocals.      The Mississippi Sheiks - excessive, muddy-sounding bass, and added reverb.  Bass is much cleaner and tighter on the LP.    The Last of the Independants - echo has been added to vocals.     Fuel To The Fire - Fairley and Arnold did a LOT of damage here.  Rory's guitar tone is distorted, there is excessive muddy bass and lots of added reverb, and there are overdubs where none existed on the LP original.  Rory wrings a moving Celtic-flavored solo from his Stratocaster on this track, but the factors listed above completely destroy the mood of what was, in its original version, an outstanding blues song.  This version is vastly different from the original, which is much cleaner and better in every way.      Despite all the negativity, for those who have the original LP, this CD is worth having for the bonus tracks (even though they are not essential), the liner notes, the remastering, and the longer version of Overnight Bag.  Just try to overlook the horribly executed remixing efforts of recording engineers who chose to disrespect the greatness of a classic album from a Guitar Master, and for whatever reason, put their own spin on it.  For those who have heard only the CD version of this great album - this is NOT what Rory originally released.  Get an LP copy to hear what this album is supposed to sound like.  Fuel to the Fire and The Mississippi Sheiks in particular sound much better in their original versions.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I see some audiophiles have paned this remastered box set.  I have Beatles recordings going back to the band's very first.  They include vinyl records, 8 track tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs.   This box set collection of remastered Beatles recordings sounds absolutely fabulous on my Onkyo system.  In my opinion, it is a vast improvement over any previous recording or re-recording in my Beatles collection, with the notable exception of the 1999 issue of the Yellow Submarine album.  I have to wonder if some of the one, two, and three star reviews are due to the authors audio system having some limitation, flaw, or not being adjusted properly.  I highly recommend this remasterd box set.  As I definitely am, I think you will be blown away.
1594488878|4.0|I think that this is Nick Hornby's first genuinely satisfying novel since High Fidelity. It was well written and nicely paced, and has some very funny sequences. While the plot is a bit silly at times (particularly in the final third of the novel), it's never over the top and the ending is satisfying. The book's main theme (moving out of unsatisfactory situations) is thoughtfully explored, and Hornby never descends into platitudes - while the characters move on from their mistakes, they make more mistakes while doing this.    A strength of the novel is that most of the characters are believable and interesting. Tucker Crowe in particularly is portrayed very sympathetically, and I found the sequences concerning his relationship with his son to be very strong. Duncan, the music obsessive, is the weakest character though, and at times is little more than a caricature.
B0000E2FLC|3.0|I was jamming out to this DVD when it froze in the middle of \\"Hells Bells\\". It would not go any further. I tried it in all my DVD players and the same thing happened. I am getting a replacement, which is great, but it seems the manufacturers would watch the quality of DVD's they put out. Otherwise the music was great.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|This is easily my favorite Daft Punk album so far. While it is in general slower-paced than earlier albums, the songs have more depth and crazy vocals and synth. Heck it seems to tell a story left up to interpretation. So many of my favorite songs are here, but sadly the ride that is this album is over far too quickly. There are only 10 songs, though with the 19-second length of \\"On/Off\\" it really boils down to 9. A must-have for any Daft Punk or techno listener.<br /><br />My favorite tracks by appearance order:<br />1. Human After All<br />2. The Prime Time Of Your Life<br />3. Robot Rock<br />8. Television Rules The Nation<br />9. Technologic
B000XTLUW0|5.0|What can I say? Its MUSE they are the best thing, musically, on the planet right now.
B000000WCV|4.0|As a casual techno/dance/club/etc. music listener, I do like most of this album. But comparing this to Daft Punk's later releases, especially my personal favorite Human After All or Discovery, it almost seems like a different group produced these songs. Around The World is still just as catchy as ever though.<br /><br />My favorite tracks by appearance:<br />1. Daftendirekt<br />4. Da Funk<br />7. Around The World<br />9. Teachers<br />10. High Fidelity<br />12. Oh Yeah<br />14. Indo Silver Club
B001AP11KW|5.0|As with everything else Jack White is involved with this is amazing. This band is full of energy, they are wonderful song writers and great musicians.
B0012YYZYK|1.0|If you already own the DVD of this concert do not bother to buy this BLU RAY disc, the sound do not improve a bit. The sound on the regular DVD is the same, the picture quality arguably is a bit better. This is far from true HD Sound...NOT RECOMMENDED.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Awesome is the word thar sums up the entire book. Some readers have given Clash of Kings and Game of Thrones bad reviews because of how bloody and sexually explicit they are. I have some news for those of that opinion: dark fantasies are called DARK for a reason.    For those of you who enjoy arthurian legends and Tom Clancy, you will love this: this is probably what would happen if Clancy tried his skills at arthurian-type stories.
B0026P3G12|2.0|First of all, I don't begrudge Susan her success. She's very brave, and although it was really overplayed by Cowell's production team, her back story at the very least indicates that she indeed deserved a break in life. And there are certainly quite a few less talented, yet successful, artists out there.<br /><br />But, let's be honest here. She's not a great singer, and this is most definitely not a great album. Her voice is quite metallic, the interpretations are soulless (not really Susan's fault, though) and the production reeks of produced sentimentality, both in musical arrangement and sound production.<br /><br />So, kudos to Susan for being brave in the first place and for being a good (but not great) singer, but please let us not become duped by Simon Cowell's cynical plays again.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Let me start off by saying that I rarely write negative reviews on Amazon.  Although I don't write that many reviews here, I prefer to spend my time writing reviews about items, movies and music that I really like that I think will be helpful to others.    That being said, this movie is so awful, I felt compelled to write about it here.  I'm a HUGE fan of the first two Terminator movies.  They both certainly rank in my top movies of all time, so I was really excited to see this latest installment.  Oh man, I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Extremely thin storyline, no new twist, horrendous amateur acting, woeful script and a complete lack of directing skill.  Basically, they took the storyline which we all know and tried to create special effects around it and use a lot of the lines from the previous films as comedic gestures.  Incredible mistake.  Using phrases like \\"I'll be back\\" and \\"Come with me if you want to live\\", completely out of context, was excruciating and embarrasing to watch. No imagination whatsoever on the directing or writing.    Although they had some really good actors in the film, the lack of a proficient director and a decent script gave them very little to work with and their performances ended up being very soap-opera'ish.  How Christian Bale got caught up in this mess is beyond me.  Although, I'm sure he got a decent paycheck for it.    I hope the next installment is put in the hands of a proper director who can infuse vision, uniqueness, direction and storyline into the project. In my opinion, give this one a miss.  It will only disappoint.
0786838655|3.0|I typically like to read a novel before the film version comes out to compare my vision (and that of the author) with the film-makers.    With the coming release of \\"The Lightning Thief\\", I jumped on Book One of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson Trilogy with great zest. I was not disappointed - though this book is nowhere near J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels.    The best thing about the book is how it brings the Greek Gods and other Olympian legends back to life for a new generation to enjoy.  Percy Jackson turns out to be a 'half-blood' - born of a mortal mother and dad being the great God, Poseidon.  This makes him a target for some less than nice Gods and others and the first adventure spends a lot of time setting the foundation for the series as Percy gets adjusted to life as a 7th Grade Demi-God.    A decent read with plenty of action - but I think it will make for a far better movie.

1590171993|5.0|I was alerted to \\"Stoner\\" by John Williams at the great Northshire Bookstore in Manchester, Vermont - maybe the best bookstore in the world and considered the best in New England.  It was a staff recommendation and, after skimming a few pages, I could already detect the depth and beauty of the writing about a once innocent, much too naive young professor - tracing his life through his career, troubled marriage, brief love affair, and his heartbreaking relationship with his daughter.  This is a brilliant, beautiful and heartbreakng novel, as good as \\"Gatsby\\" and one of the finest American novels ever written.  There is not a false note in the entire book - and each sentence and paragraph is crafted with such care and delicacy that any casual reader of modern fiction will be startled and enthralled.  \\"Stoner\\" would make a superb movie.  It is a tone poem as a novel.  A rare and brilliant work of art that has the very feel of life about it: its charms, beauties, heartbreaks and tragedies.  A five star recommended novel - one of the best and most memorable books you will ever read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Do not let the size of this behemoth of a book dissuade you because under the multitude of pages lies the best of stories. Once you begin it, you will not want to put it down, and once you have finished it, you may well find that this is a series that you will want to stick with.<br /><br />The prologue is exceptional. Though these characters do not last throughout the book, you will find yourself thinking back on their fates and wondering what will happen to the main characters when they find out the danger that they are in.<br /><br />GRRM builds the perfect character. He makes you care about them and not want anything to happen to them though they fight amongst themselves. And, he uses logic for his characters. They are smart enough to recognize a situation and figure ou what to do about it. That more than anything else is what makes the story flow so seamlessly.<br /><br />Tolkien may have made the epic fantasy famous but GRRM perfected it. If he writes the rest of the series like he wrote this book, he will have no lack of readers.
1400034205|5.0|War to Peace to War, Roaring Twenties to Depression to Renewal. An age of excess, desperation, and finally, very cautious optimism. A period not at all unlike the present one in America, with its own surfeit of professed financial wizards, conspicuous consumption, class stratification, plain old hardworking Middle Americans feeling squeezed, and those who warn against losing one's soul in the everyday pursuit of trying to \\"succeed.\\"<br /><br />Through a series of exquisitely crafted personality profiles, Somerset Maugham takes a very insightful look at the American Character - its relentless optimism, can-do spirit, its restlessness and prevailing absorption in the material. He presents us with an extraordinarily interesting spectrum of individuals, plumbs their motivations, is sympathetic to most of them and is especially hopeful about one of them. Maugham's alter ego has seen too much of the world to outright condemn or to proselytize; it's his verbal repartee that sends the messages that he wants to impart. But there's no mistaking the fact that Maugham is making some serious judgments about those he encounters, and by extension, the limits of his admiration for America, if not his fascination of it. And all the while, he does so in a most elegant and entertaining style.<br /><br />Maugham clearly cherishes the unbridled optimism of Americans, which even during their darkest hours, persists (as it does yet today). Employing a full spectrum of individual portraits, he explains for what causes Americans are willing to compromise or sell their souls, the particular fusion that many have adopted between materialism and spiritualism, and, in the case of Larry Darryl, to what degree idealism may be able to make a difference.<br /><br />Dabbling with, but ultimately departing from isolated spiritual retreats in Europe and India, Maugham's anti-status, anti-materialist hero manifests an open-mindedness, a willingness to respect others, and a burning desire for knowledge, but not knowledge as an end to itself. He speaks of creating \\"ripples in the pond\\" that maybe, just maybe, will have some kind of positive influence on another human being, and he refuses to adhere to asceticism for the sake of some self-imposed purity. He understands that no man is an island, yet he carves out the spiritual space that he needs to maintain a clear sense of purpose, all the better to touch others in any way he can.<br /><br />Like Larry Darryl, the real-life Maugham visited an ashram, stared into the eyes of a guru (fainted), but did not wall himself off. He didn't end up driving a cab, but he certainly returned to the world as the West has defined it. Perhaps, in his own peculiar way, through this book, he found a way to encourage others to be of more open heart, less judgmental, and more aware of the significant impact that we Americans can have on others if we tap into our innate idealism and use it more constructively. Less can truly be more in changing the world, just as less is more with the ending of \\"The Razor's Edge.\\"an end to itself.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|There's a real payoff in every way during the denouement of this Gilliam phantasmagoria, but sitting through the previous 90 minutes is not always easy.<br /><br />The main issue is the script and/or the editing, which produces a confusing opening act that is rarely clear and oft confusing. At points I was uncertain precisely what had happened, to whom, and why. Yet it was all so gorgeously rendered, and Damon so often wryly humorous, that I stuck it out.<br /><br />Glad I did, for the last half hour is truly masterful, and almost seems to be lifted from another movie---a movie where everything moves forward logically, the effects support the plot, and the characters' actions make sense. It made me sad, because if the rest of the film was this good it would have been a true a classic. Alas.<br /><br />My respect for Gilliam remains undiminished; his main fault here seems to me to have been not doctoring the early part of the script to make more sense and move more quickly. There are various liitle inside jokes/lines about not having enough money, which further research reveals must have been Gilliam's pokes at the studio for giving him \\"only\\" 75 million dollars to make this. Since when is 75 mil a pittance? One of the extra features has Gilliam mentioning that he wanted to avoid CGI and use real-action, but when he saw the rushes of the walking trees, for example, they looked horrible. And thus he used CGI. Sounds like Terry is at fault for not budgeting himself properly and blowing too much on pipe dreams.<br /><br />So perhaps that's where all the money went. In any case, the costumes and sets are mostly stellar, and the film looks like a million bucks, or at least 75. Yet the flaws remain. No order of filmic extravagances can save a muddled script. Ledger did little for me; Damon outperforms him easily by bringing some wryness to his portrayal, something Ledger was incapable of here. There are many moments reminiscent of other fantasy flicks; Legend and Van Helsing seemed to have been touchstones. But this film suffers as Legend did from implacability, and doesn't have enough of VH's tongue in cheek self-mocking to make it all fun.<br /><br />There are also some jarring scenes that detract, like the lengthy very real skinning of a rabbit, sickening to see in context of all this beauty. The kitchen sink et cetera are here, and take away from the focus of the movie, which to me should have been more on the original Grimm's fables and their many lovely and fearful contrasts and less on this script's pointlessly byzantine workings.<br /><br />I'd rarely recommend it, but simply watching the last half hour of BG might be the way to go. You won't miss much plotwise, and you'll see a truly great mini-movie. It'll make you want to see the rest, and when you watch that you'll lament at how close this is to a truly classic fantasy flick...and how far.<br /><br />But then again, Gilliam gave us not only the excellent movies Brazil and Time Bandits, and the perfect Holy Grail, but also the slapdash flops of Jabberwocky and Baron Munchhausen; this isn't his first confusing mess. Perhaps his Python buddies would have added the humor and focus this film shoots for but never quite attains.<br /><br />[And by the way: Happy New Decade to all!

B002VECMAY|4.0|In many ways, UP IN THE AIR feels like LOST IN TRANSLATION without the Japanese setting. Characters drift but take comfort in their lack of familial ties, while others flail about, desperate to create them. As a jet-setting lothario who makes his living telling worker bees their jobs no longer exist, George Clooney exudes charm and charisma; we like him even though he's essentially a hitman doing the dirty work of corporate C.E.O.'s. As with TRANSLATION, the outcome is cloudy but never really in doubt. Aided by an impeccable supporting cast that includes Anna Kendrick and the always-reliable J.K. Simmons, UP IN THE AIR should be considered among the front-runners for the year's best movie.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine sheds light on events that took place prior to the original X-Men movie. The film takes us back to James \\"Jimmie\\" Logan's childhood where a very young Wolverine is forced to flee with his older brother following an unfortunate chain of events leading to the death of his father and stepfather. His troubles however, have only just begun...  Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, however, there is a very noticeable absence of attractive women that we have become accustomed to in previous X-Men films (such as Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and Rebecca Romijn among others).   X-Men Origins: Wolverine is very well written and very well presented, and thus allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the action, and the music are all good.  In short, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection. KEEP'EM COMING!

B002T9H2LA|5.0|Tarantino's best work by far. The casting is quickly becoming legendary, and QT was able to let up on his qwerky directing stylising just enough so that the film didn't seem novelty, but it was still undoubtedly a Tarantino film. Everything about the film, from the tickling cameos to the subtle dark humours and the soundtrack and even the lighting, was textbook execution. Inglourious Basterds is simply a great film, and I know we all hope to see Christoph Waltz in more American films.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I just received the DVD in the mail and finished watching it.  This is simply outrageous and incredible.  One would think that this sort of irresponsible corporate behavior only happened in the 3rd world.  WRONG! This is happening right here in our backyard.  I am indeed surprised that Monsanto, Perdue and others have not silenced Eric Schlosser or managed to ban the DVD.    It seems that human beings NEVER LEARN.  Throughout human history there have been numerous empires, a search in WIKI with the word \\"List of empires\\" will produce a huge list.  Each of them thought they will be around forever.  However, if someone in this century can name even five of those long gone empires, I would be impressed!  The point I am trying to make is that human greed that drives these sort of practices can never last.  Granted it will do a lot of damage until it is expunged, but its days are numbered.      Ask any student in high school these days, if they have heard of IBM and you will probably get a blank look.  The same would be the case for General Dynamics and a host of other big behemoth corporations which have all been reduced to the status of \\"Also ran!\\"  The point I am driving at is that longevity and artificially created monopolization do not mix well.  They may appear to be winning for a time, but in retrospect it is always for a short duration.    I always maintain that we do not need an external power to destroy us, because we will destroy ourselves through greed!  What Al Qaeda was unable to do, namely dismantling the economy of this great nation, was almost suceesfully accomplished by the \\"All American\\" big corporations such as, Lehman Bros., AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Citi Corp etc     Likewise Monsanto, Perdue, Tyson, Con Agra, BPI, IBP, Smithfield and the others in the film, along with the Healthcare (Hospitals and Doctors) corporations will send everyone to an early grave through lots of suffering.  However, hopefully sooner rather than later, the public will wake up and cry, \\"Enough!\\"      This film must be shown 24/7 on cable networks, made available in schools, libraries, gym, etc.  Anyone who has children must make them watch this film so that they are made aware of the consequences of what they put into their mouths.     For those who are open to advice from a stranger, I suggest that they clean out their colon, eat raw living foods (sprouts, green smoothies, wheatgrass juice, fruits, seeds, uncooked food etc) and do LOTS of yoga.  This is the way to a disease free life with minimum impact upon the environment and resources -- land and human suffering.  This will also help reduce the cost of health care tremendously.  Most importantly it will produce health and happiness in the lives of everyone who follows the advice.  Any  disease, manifested or gestating or seemingly incurable, will be healed.  This is my greatest learning in the 51 yrs I have been on this planet!  Please take action for your health while you still can.  Once you slip into the jaws of the mega corporations through eating the manipluated and poisoned food, or by being operated upon by the modern butchers of medicine (doctors), it may be too late to recover from a fate worse than death!    Here is another DVD that I place in the same stellar league as this one.  The name is \\"Healing Cancer\\".  Even though the title implies that it deals with cancer alone, in reality the methods therein are generic enough to apply to all diseases -- chronic, degenerative and terminal.

B001OQCV60|2.0|Director Guy Ritchie does violence to Sherlock Holmes. This movie is not awful as it is really disappointing.<br /><br />So many new movies are written for a generation of people hooked on video games with a chronic inability to concentrate.  Since the intended audience is squirming around in their seats awaiting the next car/coach chase or fight scene there is no need for thought or logic. A character like Irene Adler is a friend to the Sherlock Holmes in one scene, and enemy in another, a friend later, then enemy etc. Since these viewers can't focus their attention, there is no need for a coherent plot. They won't think back to scene one - if she was Holmes friend, why did she do that then?? - because the audience, raised on violent nonsense video games doesn't care or can't remember that far back. (The same incoherent plot was in the last pathetic James Bond movie \\"Quantum of Solace\\".)<br /><br />This movie is all special effects. It turns the Sherlock Holmes character into a prize fighter, abandons all logic until a tack-on in the last five minutes. He carries a gun! In the books Watson had the gun, Sherlock usually used his brain (except in \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\") . Logic thought and deduction, the hallmark of Sherlock Holmes, is all but forgotten for most of the movie. What's left is chases and fight scenes. Sherlock's bickering relationship with Watson is  like b*tchy arguing sessions between an old gay couple.<br /><br />The London filthy industrial East End, is the Limehouse, (the one of the reasons Britons were called \\"Limies\\"). Much of Limehouse/Whitechapel was destroyed by the Nazi's in WWII. Limehouse has somehow been moved miles upstream a block from the Houses of Parliament. The richest city in the world, the center of the 1880's universe, has been changed by the director into slums, docks, with filth, grime and large shipbuilding and large industry.  Not in Limehouse, but in the center of the city!<br /><br />In about this historical timeframe, a brilliant but egotistical Aleister Crowley marched into the temple of occultist Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and demanded to take over and  oust the leader, McGregor  Mathers. He was tossed out on his ear. This really happened.  In this movie, behind the leaders of Parliament is a shadowy group of Egyptian/ pseudo Golden Dawn magicians peacefully running England in the background. The order is been taken over by Lord Blackwood, bent on ruling the world through fear, a character roughly modeled on Aleister Crowley, except he lacks Crowley's brains (and Crowley was never a black magician, never a satanist and never murdered anyone). Blackwood is just mean, a comic book villain psychopath who kills foes and uses stage magic and Egyptian mumbo jumbo to frighten anyone who doesn't agree with him.<br /><br />The one bright spot in this garbage is Robert Downey Jr, who does the best he can with this terrible screenplay. He is convincing as the whip smart and idiosyncratic Holmes; he is conscious, he sees things everyone else misses. He gets bored without a case and shoots the Queen's initials \\"VR\\" in bullet holes his wall. (This is one of the few parts of the movies actually taken from Conan Doyle.)  If Downey had only been given a better script...That's why I give it 2 stars instead of one.<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jeremy Brett are turning over in their graves. Avoid this Sherlock Holmes. See Avatar, another action-adventure movie, but a much better one.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|This film is awful! If you are a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, you are warned to STAY AWAY!<br />It was fun to see the original characters again, but the awful plot made this film very frustrating and painful to watch. This movie is bright and shiny, fast and LOUD!  The film moves at a breakneck pace, presumably to keep you from noticing how dumb it is. Star Trek has become Flash Gordon! This is a big budget B-movie.<br /><br /> The script for this film has NOTHING original in it - it's cobbled together from bits of past Trek movies: a meglomaniacal Romulan seeking revenge on a main character - lifted from Nemesis; Enterprise full of Star Fleet cadets must rush of to the rescue - lifted from Generations; bad guy has a super weapon which destroys planets, and only the crew of Enterprise can stop him - taken from Generations; a defenseless(!) Earth threatened by a giant alien spacecraft, Enterprise must rush to the rescue - stolen from A Voyage Home (or First Contact, take your pick); A future version of one of the main characters gives a person in the past a formula for advanced technology, which they would have invented anyway - lifted from A Voyage Home. You get the idea.<br /><br />[Spoiler Alert]<br />Spock has become senile! Planet Romulus, the Romulan's home world, is going to destroyed by it's sun, which has become a super nova, so Spock hatches a scheme to use an artificially created black hole to suck up the super nova in order to save Romulus. Um, Spock? What about the brand new black hole now at the center of the Romulan solar system? Isn't THAT going to destroy Romulus just as handily as the super nova would have? D'oh!<br />[End Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />Casting: I do like the casting of most of the characters. The only misstep is the new Scotty.  Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) was a bad choice to play Scotty.<br /><br />I would be happy to see this new crew ( with a different Scotty) in action if the story were written by an actualSci-Fi author who understands the premise of Star Trek, and the characters.  Maybe a film in which the Enterprise goes boldy where no one has gone before, seeking new life forms and new civilizations? Too much to hope for?
B00004RF9B|5.0|I would call this genre-setting movie \\"Forbidden Pleasure\\" -- as it is far better than I expected. The \\"special effects\\" made use of -- may be \\"primitive\\" and \\"lo-tech\\" versus \\"advanced hi-tech\\" 21st century FX -- but in usage are just fine to express the effects needed to carry the great plot. The actors and acting are grand-old-supurb-vintage as well. I can easily see why Anne Francis is still remembered -- she appears with smooth curves and beauty very much like the first Barbie dolls -- but she is lively, animated and expressive as well. Well-paced ongoing drama occurs as the plot jogs along at a good but not rushed pace. I especially like the color-and-shade balance-and-contrast of the scenes and scenery -- russet-and-golds versus silver-and-blues for example. The matte-painting is so well-done -- that somehow a 3D background and foreground is well-rendered -- despite what must be ever-present painted 2D subscenes. The out-of-this-world electronic-music and sound-effects all thru the movie are wonderful -- way futuristic -- as are the settings with their alien shapes and curves -- even when [barely apparent] 1950s-projected \\"hi-tech\\" is used. It is all done so well that it is still quite \\"alien hi-tech\\" seeming -- even now. What could seem dated -- seems rather to fit-in with the whole movie.  This movie is only matched by a few other sci-fi greats from its time -- such as \\"It Came from Outer Space\\" [1953] and \\"The War of the Worlds\\" [1953] -- which have comparable classic virtues. Now, I understand why all three of those great old classic sci-fi movies Inspire even now +++
B002SJIO4A|4.0|This movie reminded me a lot of Robocop, StarShip Troopers Paul Verhoeven. As stated in the opening of the film, it's mentioned about the alien ship not hovering above NYC, DC, or Chicago. This film was very different in that it dealt with an alien invasion in a 3rd world country that is technologically not advanced and in the world's most poorest continent. I thought the story was great dealing an ordinary citizen going against the aliens, and then turning one into himself fights along side them. It's amazing the lies the media spun against him and how quick his father in law was to profit from him and his wife turn against him. I thought that was the true horror and the possible experimentation of MNU and being profited over with his body and the other aliens. In this film it was weird to see that the aliens were technologically advanced, but were dumb enough to be lured and encamped by Humans. Also it did not show the good sign of Human nature (much like the recent release of Avatar). When strangers from another world arrive at our door step how do we treat them? I also don't believe that the super powers of the world-the US, EU, China, Russia, Brazil would even allow South Africa to deal with Aliens as it has been given the track record of a slow developing country with escalating problems of it's own. I honestly think the bigger nations would step in and take over. But I could see the big corporations, and many of the governments taking a vested interested in the alien technology and using it for their own right.
B000002J29|4.0|I don't want to overly-hype but this is a beautiful album, overlooked by many since it was performed soon after Peter Gabriel's departure from the group. Most of the songs are actually better than the studio versions, benefiting from the added percussion of Bill Bruford to help them from being snoozey like the studio versions can be sometimes.  To the relief of everyone, Phil Collins did a great job on vocals to fill the vacancy left by Peter Gabriel. Dynamic with both quiet and driving passages, all instruments are very well played, and the audience interaction really shows a true deep appreciation of their experience. As with many live recordings it can be sometimes hard to make out the lyrics with total clarity, but all selections on this album are solid and performed with feeling. The subsequent mixing and post recording editing only enhance the album in making it one of my favorite live albums. Some critics give it 3½ stars, but the way it makes me feel warrant at least 4 stars if not more. Definitely give it a listen if you are a fan of older Genesis stuff. You will be glad you did.
B002HNA95E|5.0|As I am not only a perfectionist but a completist as well, since all of Madonna's compilations have been grossly inadequate I decided to compile my own greatest hits/best of and I ended up with three 80 minute cds. Some of Madonna's best works were not singles so I have included them here of course. You will notice some of her biggest hits are missing because for my personal taste about half of her popular stuff is unlistenable and will not be included in my best of compilations. It is in alphabetical order since I was too lazy to copy the Celebration release the way it was listed. I will list the various versions and albums/singles I took them off of.    cd1:    01. Bedtime Story (Greatest Hits volume 2 version - I would have preferred the Bedtime Stories album version but due to time constraints I had to use the slightly edited GHV2 version)    02. Borderline (Celebration version - I was never a big fan of this song so this version is fine for the remastering job)    03. Erotica (Celebration version - I'm not happy with the edit on this song but I am not a huge fan of this song)     04.  Express Yourself (Celebration version  - they definitely should have used the video version of this song, it is one of her biggest hits and one of my favourites even now, I hate whoever decided to use this awful version for Celebration)      05. Get Together (Single version - this is one of my top five all time favourite Madonna songs, sure it is sampled from some other guys song but how many of Madonna's songs AREN'T stolen, I don't like the version from Confessions On A Dancefloor since they have the horrible fade outs between each song, so that is why I was forced to buy the single)    06. Holiday (Celebration version - I have never really liked this song but I had to include it since it is one of her most well known songs)      07. Hung Up (Celebration version - which luckily is the full version of this song and in case you're wondering WHY it is the full version it is becauseit is arguably her biggest worldwide hit EVER)    08. Into the Groove (Celebration version - I have never been a big fan of this song so this version is fine)     09. Justify My Love (Celebration version - one of my all time fave Madonna songs, I love the remastering job and it is another song which Madonna stole 100% and just put her name on it, the beat is a Public Enemy instrumental and the lyrics were written by someone else and not credited)     10. Like A Prayer (Celebration version - some trivia on this song I read that Prince did the lead guitar work but maybe he was too embarrassed to be associated with Madonna to bother to receive credit)     11. Like a Virgin (Like A Virgin Warner remasters version - the fact they would use a horrible edit for this song on Celebration is beyond insane, I prefer the full version)     12. Music (Celebration version - I love this song and am happy with the remastering job for this song, true the blips and beeps are odd but they are part of the appeal of the song)    13. Open Your Heart (True Blue Warner remasters version - another song where they used the horrible edit on the Celebration version, one of my fave Madonna songs)     14. Ray of Light (Single version - another example where they used a horrible edit on Celebration, this is my fave Madonna song of all time, so I definitely had to use the single version which is the full version and has a perfect mastering job even now 11 years later)     15. Secret (Bedtime Stories version - GHV2 and Celebration both used the horrible edit and as this is one of my favourite songs I was forced to use the old album version but the mastering job still holds up surprisingly well)     16. True Blue (True Blue Warner remasters version - this song has strangely never been on a greatest hits compilation, sure it only reached number two on billboard but meh, I always loved this song)     17. Vogue (Single version - another one of her biggest hits, I absolutely deplore the version used onImmaculate Collection and Celebration, the only acceptable version of this song is the original single version, and the mastering job still sounds okay after almost 20 years now)     cd2    01. Bad Girl (Single version taken from the Bad Girl single - one of my top ten fave Madonna songs, it is very catchy and the single version is the best version)     02. Beautiful Stranger (Calderone Club Mix from the Single version of Beautiful Stranger - definitely one of her best songs and I only just discovered this song a few years ago, if you haven't heard it, the best version is 10 minutes 11 seconds)     03. Cherish (Celebration version - one of her sweetest songs)      04. Crazy for You (Celebration version - this version I had to get used to but it is acceptable, written for Sean Penn apparently, about the same time she bought her lips, read about it in her brother's biography about his life with Madonna, Penn used to beat up tiny little Madonna, she's only like 5 feet tall, how cruel is that?)      05. Deeper And Deeper (GHV2 version - my second favourite Madonna song ever)     06. Don't Cry For Me Argentina (GHV2 version - one of my top ten fave Madonna songs, one of her first songs after her famous voice lessons, so with her very limited range she started sounding better)    07. Don't Tell Me (Celebration version - completely new version than I had never heard before, one of my new fave songs with this oddly clipped version)     08. Frozen (Celebration version - completely new version that I've never heard before, very good remastering job)     09. Human Nature (GHV2 version - one of her better songs)    10. I Love New York (Confessions On A Dancefloor version - I edited the song to make it sound acceptable, it is one of my top tens again and has one of the funniest Madonna lines ever, \\"I don't like cities but I like New York, other places make me feel like a dork\\"    11. Live To Tell (Celebration version - this song has been on EVERY bloody compilation thus far, butis a superior song so I guess that is alright)     12. Material Girl (Celebration version - kind of a weird edit but it is still seemingly a full version, not viciously edited like some of her others on Celebration)     13. Papa Don't Preach (Celebration version - one of her most popular songs but not one of my top twenty favourites)     14. Rescue Me (Immaculate Collection q sound version - still one of my favourite all time Madonna songs, it is just a cool song)     15. Take A Bow (Celebration version - luckily it is the full version and definitely one of her best written and best produced songs, Babyface could do no wrong when this came out, his used toilet paper could produce better songs than the crap we have today)     16. You Must Love Me (taken from the single obviously - the first song of hers after her famous voice lessons, very sweet song indeed)    cd3    01. Beautiful Stranger (taken from the Beautiful Stranger single - one of her best songs, similar to Ray of Light but not a cannabalised version though, top 5 for sure)    02. Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Miami Mix version from the single - definitely one of her best dance remixes ever and a personal fave)    03. Don't Stop (taken from the album Bedtime Stories - definitely one of my favourite songs, Bedtime Stories is my vote for Madonna's best album with Confessions a close second, very little filler and at least 80% of the album is killer)    04. Express Yourself (Immaculate Collection version - one of my all time favourite Madonna dance songs, this song is still the best all these years later)    05. Fever (Murk Boys Miami Mix, taken from the Bad Girl single - and one of her better dance remixes)    06. Forbidden Love (taken from the album Confessions On A Dancefloor - I had to edit it to sound acceptable but definitely one of her best dance songs, killer retro sound effects and blips and beeps like Music)    07. Future Lovers, read previous description for Forbidden Love, taken from Confessions ona Dancefloor - an amazing song    08. Jump, read previous description for Forbidden Love and Future Lovers, taken from Confessions on a Dancefloor - an amazing song as well, has possibly my favourite Madonna cliché and her songs have a thousand clichés \\"there's only so much you can learn in one place, the more that I wait, the more time that I waste\\"    09. Like A Prayer (Immaculate Collection version - this song is definitely one of her best dance mixes, very cool)    10. Lucky Star (Celebration version, not in my top twenty but still acceptable)    11. Ray Of Light (Calderone and Quayle Club Mix, from the single obviously - definitely one of my top 5 fave dance remixes)    12. Skin (taken from the album Ray of Light - this is my favourite of all Madonna songs that weren't released as singles, very good and similar to but not exactly like Ray Of Light)    13. Sorry (Confessions On A Dancefloor version - this version is 1000 times better than the Celebration version, I had to edit it to make it sound acceptable)    14. Thief Of Hearts (taken from the album Erotica - this is my second favourite of Madonna's filler, it is very similar to Vogue and Deeper And Deeper but it is just a cool song about a lady ready to rip a new hole for some girl who stole her boyfriend, you go girl!)    15. What It Feels Like For A Girl (GHV2 version - this song always gets me teary eyed as Madonna rightfully puts men in her place and tells them, you'd love to know what it's like wouldn't you? What It Feels Like For A Girl, I guess she's referring to bisexual men reversing the sexual roles but whatever, Madonna is one of those alphas who has always had a bigger penis than most men anyway)      So there you go. I now have massive Madonna fatigue after writing about three cds worth of her songs. She has enough to compile a fourth cd but enough for now.
1416572287|5.0|\\"How to Teach Physics to Your Dog\\" shows that a true understanding of a subject is proven by an ability to explain the central and primary ideas in a clear-and-sharp way. I have not seen such a clear-and-sharp explanation of primary quantum physics since Richard Feynman. Chad Orzel does this with far less advanced math as well. The intervening dialogs with \\"Emmy\\", the quantum dog, are fun, and further the explanation of quantum topics.  The explanations are BOTH clear AND sharp -- and the explanatory examples and diagrams are just as well-chosen. The explanations are very CLEAR -- as EASY to follow as such quantum topics can be MADE to be. They are also very SHARP -- very careful in their cause-and-effect relations, implications and limitations. Chad Orzel is very picky in a very good way -- knows just what to show, just how far to go and just when to stop.<br /><br />In particular, I greatly value the Central Principles of Quantum Mechanics EXACTLY as laid-out starting with the first pages of chapter 3. That is -- 1. Wavefunctions -- 2. Allowed States -- 3. Probability -- 4. Measurement --. Chad Orzel explains these four CENTRAL aspects in a very clear-and-sharp way -- and exactly just when and how quantum interpetation and resulting alternatives occur -- and their cause-and-effect relations, implications and limitations. So, it is possible to better understand just what is \\"real\\" and \\"unreal\\" about quantum physics and the main interpetations of quantum physics -- via the Central Principles of Quantum Mechanics. As Chad Orzel points-out -- it IS quite strange that quantum physics, accurate to fourteen significant figures, can have such latitude in interpetation. Yet, to be sure, after Bell Non-locality has been worked-out and proven via numerous experiments -- there is only so much latitude and no more -- as Chad Orzel shows step-by-step.<br /><br />I learned some new aspects of quantum physics and cleared-up some murky areas and ideas of my own. This is despite my own fairly advanced physics and mathematics background, including quantum physics. So, I re-learned an over-all lesson -- one cannot assume clear-and-sharp understanding of a given subject without clear-and-sharp review and reflection -- despite knowing many details of the subject. Nothing replaces such a clear-and-sharp overview -- and without it one can get lost in the details and mistaken in application of detailed methods. Of course, the reverse is equally valid -- without knowing even central and primary details of a subject, especially one like quantum physics, there is little chance of good real-world application -- as the very last part of this book shows about murky attempts to apply quantum physics \\"buzz-words\\" to various fringe topics such as \\"free\\" energy, \\"easy\\" alternative technology and \\"easy\\" alternative metaphysics. As Chad Orzel states, if seems too good to be true it most likely IS too good to be true. In any case, it seems unwise to so quickly throw quantum names and terms in directions far away from quantum-scale wave-packets +++anced physics and mathematics background, including quantum physics.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|As a Christian who has seen this film I already know that there is a spiritual world out there. A 3rd of Satan's angles turned demons were cast down from heaven. I also don't believe the psychic's mombo jumbo that 'ghosts are not demons'. Ghosts are demons. You see when you die you go to heaven or hell. No one stays on Earth. So when people are contacting 'their grandmother' it's really a demon. Your grandmother went to heaven or hell. Demons who are ghosts roam the Earth seeking who they can devour with Satan's help. This movie shows the stupidity of people who are not Christian, do not believe in Jesus, and do not know what they are messing with open the door for possession and evil. I do believe that Katie has been followed from her life because demons can pick who they want to harass, and devour themselves. Her boyfriend Micha was dumb as can be and antagonized it and believed he could conquer it. The film definitely felt real and gave you a \\"Blair Witch feel\\". Even though it wasn't true there is a spiritual world out there and if you don't know Jesus Christ or the Devil and his minions you are opening a door that cannot be shut.
1563890119|5.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loved it, now I have to get a copy for myself!
B0021L8UPS|1.0|This movie offered nothing to it's audience, but the idea that there are some how people in America that have not seen a horror movie.  When bad stuff happens, and happens often, would you blame the person you have known the longest or the person who just arrived last week? Exactly!<br /><br /> I did see this in the theater and I did leave towards the end.
B00005MP58|1.0|This dramatization with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is my favorite of all the dramatizations of Pride and Prejudice, but the DVD is a huge disappointment.  They cut out major portions (how can they do that without letting you know it's abridged?), and the the color and sound are absolutely awful. Stick with the VHS version.  It's much better.  What a huge waste of money this was. I am very disappointed. I wish I had read the other reviews of the DVD before buying it.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought this from my store(Gamestop), as a X mas gift to myself, and with a giftcard a friend gave me, but anyways. I got this a little skeptical, knowing what i know aboot turtle beach, but still unsure.<br /><br />Let me tell you, if you don't have surround sound, by these. There are awesome, the quality is great, and the sound is clear. They say you get what you pay for, and with these you do. It is a higher price then even the Sony Blu-tooth, which is still another great headset, but these are just awesome. Playing Dead Space was a whole new experience with these on.<br /><br />Now i had read reviews before buying talking about a hissing sound of sorts. I got that once, and thats when i was setting it up. I was able to rule it out to feedback noise, but with tweaks, it was just fine.<br /><br />They are wired, but have a really long cable, so that should suit anybody just fine.<br /><br />In closing, yes it is pricey, but worth is, especially if you don't have surround sound.<br /><br />A+
B002NV8KGU|5.0|This show has had a lot of buzz, and all of my friends keep telling me how they are hooked on Mad Men. I finally gave it a shot, and after one episode, I was hooked. After two episodes, I was addicted.    It's amazing how quickly they are able to develop the characters and how quickly this show can get you hooked.    The Amazon Video on Demand HD version has very good quality. I just wish it was available as a rental, since this is a fairly expensive way to catch up on the show.    I haven't been this hooked on a show since The West Wing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|this workout is really great. i am a runner, and my gym is a 15 minute walk from my house, and with living in cold, snowy denver, it is so great to have an awesome workout that i can do without having to face the snow. jillian is motivating, and i was sore after the very first day! definitely have a good pair of hand weights, i think at least 5 pounds, but 8 would be better to get a nice lifting workout. this video is going to be in my workout rotation from now on!
B0000AI45P|5.0|I'm going to guess some of you are like me:  I've long admired The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The Clash, and Joy Division, but at the height of the punk movement I was too young to know about it, so I've had to learn about it after the fact.  I've read a few books about those acts and that era, and have browsed many others.  Thus, I've seen plenty mentions of Television, but nothing prompted me try to hear them until a few weeks ago.<br /><br />If your experience is similar, you should order MARQUEE MOON right now.  I think my life might have unfolded much differently if one of those books had more urgently stressed the greatness of Television.  I regret that this wasn't a part of my life the last 20 years, when it so easily could have been.  I'm dusting off my guitar, because this has inspired me to play like nothing else.<br /><br />Just incredible.  Television, you are amazing, and I really hope I can have another lifetime where I can see you guys in action.<br /><br />Also, Television isn't really \\"punk.\\"  Maybe that's why the books about punk didn't succeed at opening my eyes.  Television are their own category.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|Only a complete, brain-dead moron would call this a family film. The deadly carnage begins within the first few minutes and continues nonstop for the entire film. Maybe all those civilians and cars they destroyed during the Drive through Paris were full of escape murders and child molesters so they deserved what they got. Just because it is all computer generated doesn't make it family fun. It's still just bad movie making. I feel diseased just for watching it and am ashamed of myself for even renting it. The acting was totally hideous. The only good thing I can say about this movie is it had great special effects. Unfortunately, most movies today, good or bad, can make that claim. Stay away from this film.
B000003N8G|4.0|This is great, post-avant gaurd Impulse jazz from Charlie Haden, who was one of Ornette Coleman's bass players.<br /><br />Though on Impulse and containing free jazz elements, this is from 1969, when a lot of free jazz musicians started intigratinng the form with other styles of music.<br /><br />This album contains a Spanish feel, with spanish guitar, and lots of Iberian flavored horns. Don Cherry, Carla Bley, Roswell Rudd, many top, second wave avant musicians are on this album.<br /><br />Free Jazz fans will like this, but the real grabber is the Spanish spice.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|I bought this as a present for a couple of friends, and they loved it, as the other reviewers said, they are made of plastic, however this little flashlight puts a fair amount of light for its size, I loved it so much that I ordered one for myself, so I highly recommend it.
B000SEGCRS|3.0|I actually bought Volume 2 first (a printed copy on actual paper!) because I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer and could probably skip most of the Volume 1 content.  I liked this book enough that I gave Volumes 1 and 3 a closer look.  These books are priced a bit high for printed copies.  They're aren't very long and are a pretty quick read.  Most pages aren't completely filled.  So, I decided to get the Kindle editions of Volumes 1 and 3 to read on my iPhone and PC at home.  I don't own an actual Kindle device.  Photography books are next to useless on currently available e-ink screens like the Kindle's.  I had hoped for better results on the iPhone and PC when viewing these books, though.  The images are there (another user said the images didn't display at all on his Kindle...), but on the iPhone, they are so overly compressed and low-resolution that they are nearly useless for their intended demonstration of photographic techniques.  The PC version of the Kindle reader also suffers from this problem.  The PC version currently does not allow you to zoom in on photos either, though, that is supposedly a \\"coming soon\\" feature.  Not that it will do any good unless Amazon does something about the image compression and resizing.  Books tagged as \\"photography\\" books should have special care taken with images they contain.  The images are half the point of the book!
0545123267|5.0|WOW!  I absolutely love this book and can not wait until the next one comes out.  It was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  With the multitude of paranormal romance/vampire/werewolf, etc. stories out there, I was concerned that this would be just another rehashing of the same old story.  However, the plot is fresh and unique.  The story is beautifully written.  The characters are well developed.  The female character (Grace) is strong, smart, and able to take care of business.  She isn't needy and insecure.  The male character (Sam) is sensitive and smart, but haunted by his past and what he really is.  The two are a great fit for each other.  Unlike many characters in teen romances, they don't become annoying as the moon over each other - always telling each other how they don't deserve each other.    Really a great book.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|What do you get when you take a series that had a great first season, and add it up with its downright brilliant second season? The best damn thing on TV, is what you get.    Vince Gilligan and his crew created something original and daring, I was aware of that the first time I saw the pilot episode. I was immediately fascinated by the use of camera, the clever editing and of course the beautiful scenery - which very quickly became a character of its own.    You get all those things in season two as well, but in addition the writing is as deep as it only is on one other show on TV right now(Mad Men). It's just an entirely different level.  The subject only got uglier this season, there are multiple scenes that are painful to watch, which is a testimonial to the writing and the acting alone - it feels incredibly real, and it is truly gut-wrenching.    Every character has its place in this season. Not only Walt and Jesse are the ones being developed, no, Hank, Marie, Skyler, to name a few, they all are very carefully written and not just being used as meaningless additions to fill some empty spots. Walt's continuing involvement with the drug world drives him further away from his wife Skyler, as he stays out longer and more frequent with no explanations or explanations that are obvious and demeaning lies. This makes for some very powerful scenes.  Hank's career takes an unexpected turn, and becomes surprisingly interesting as he struggles with some shocking events he had to experience - all due to Walt.    The performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are spectacular. This season is a lot more serious than the first. It's a process that began with the very first episode. Walt got himself into a world of trouble and he seems to be pulling down everyone around him, and this season showed some results of that already. This process the actors of course have to adapt to as well, and boy do they adapt fast and flawlessly. Aaron Paul is the breakout star of this season,it's not an easy job to shine when you have to work alongside an actor like Bryan Cranston, but he does. It's a given that both their Emmy nominations, respectively wins, were highly deserved.    There is too much to write about here, this season is packed with brilliant moments. I can obviously not address them all. Let me just say if they manage to continue on this level of quality, Breaking Bad will go down in history as one of the greatest shows of all time, up there with The Sopranos and the likes.    Spread the word, this one's a gem.
0743455967|3.0|If you're a Stephen King fan, you'll probably like this book.  It gives you a window into his personal life and how he got the ideas for some of his stories.  All in all, he seems to be a very disciplined, hard nosed guy with a sardonic sense of humor.  If you want to know about the craft of writing, however, you're not going to get much of value here.  Time and time again, King explains that writers need to be disciplined and that writing is more about dedication than it is about inspiration.  That's good advice of course, but any aspiring writer can find such advice just about anywhere.  I don't think the title of this book is an accurate reflection of its content.  The book is really about one writer's life, not about writing.  King has lead an interesting life, and his book is a compelling read.  But those who want to know how to go about the business of creating a novel will need to look elsewhere.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Here we go again...yet another over-hyped, underwhelming, v cinematic suppository. This movie is just like its predecessors - The Blair Witch Project, Open Water, The Descent, and Wolf Creek to name a few - in claiming to be a movie \\"so scary you will crap yourself then be traumatized for life afterward.\\" All of these movies claimed the same thing and were all terrible, boring films with little to no scares. I have had enough already, and I cannot fathom how any finds this or any of the aforementioned titles to be the least bit scary. Unless you find suddenly slamming doors, random grunts, and loud crashes out of no where to be scary. This movie is about as frightening as Milo & Otis.<br /><br />The Age of Innocence moves faster than this movie. There is no real build up, and is just generally boring throughout. Nothing happens until about the last minute of the movie but it is a moot point by then because the rest of the movie was so utterly slow and pointless. I don't watch these movies so that I can watch people argue in docu-drama style, that is about all that seems to happen. If I want to experience real-life arguments, I will step outside and listen to my white trash neighbors go at it. This is a typical horror movie filmed in documentary style and they all follow the same mundane formula. Boring dialog that escalates into arguments with a few minor scares usually in the form of random noises by unseen things. The whole experience in the end is big let down and I can't understand how moviegoers and critics alike still praise this awful form of film making. Or how people continue to find this crap scary, I will just never understand it. The scariest part of watching this movie was my fiance's sudden loud snore when you feel asleep without my knowledge!<br /><br />I am steering clear from anymore of these \\" scariest movie of all time\\" claims from here on out. I am big fan of the horror genre and how looking for something that will give me a good scare. I don't scare easily and have been a big horror fan all my life which is maybe why I never find the alleged scare claims to be true. To each his own I guess but if you are going to make such big boasts for god sakes please deliver for once and stop wasting my time and money.<br /><br />One of the taglines for this movie was \\"What happens when you sleep?\\" If you want find out, pop this movie in and you will be asleep in no time.have been a big horror fan all my life which is maybe why I never find the alleged scare claims to be true.

Walt's continuing involvement with the drug world drives him further away from his wife Skyler, as he stays out longer and more frequent with no explanations or explanations that are obvious and demeaning lies. This makes for some very powerful scenes.  Hank's career takes an unexpected turn, and becomes surprisingly interesting as he struggles with some shocking events he had to experience - all due to Walt.    The performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are spectacular. This season is a lot more serious than the first. It's a process that began with the very first episode. Walt got himself into a world of trouble and he seems to be pulling down everyone around him, and this season showed some results of that already. This process the actors of course have to adapt to as well, and boy do they adapt fast and flawlessly. Aaron Paul is the breakout star of this season,it's not an easy job to shine when you have to work alongside an actor like Bryan Cranston, but he does. It's a given that both their Emmy nominations, respectively wins, were highly deserved.    There is too much to write about here, this season is packed with brilliant moments. I can obviously not address them all. Let me just say if they manage to continue on this level of quality, Breaking Bad will go down in history as one of the greatest shows of all time, up there with The Sopranos and the likes.    Spread the word, this one's a gem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was so wicked awesome i loved it. i reread it at least 10 times before i returned it. you have to read it!
B001FB55I0|5.0|I've seen this Blu-ray twice, Director's Cut once. The extra three minutes isn't much, but it does add a bit of smoothness to the story. If an extended version ever comes out (late 2010?) I'll be there to get my copy. I also read most of the complaints about this movie in between my two viewings. It didn't make any difference. Thankfully this movie doesn't remind me of T2 that much. Instead I think of Blade Runner and the recent TV series Battlestar Galactica. These are all treatments of similar ideas (replicant androids, and/or dominant robots) which I really enjoy.<br /><br />I'm happy with the story, the casting, the acting ability of the cast, and the state-of-the-art production quality; AND the design and visual concepts, special effects, music, etc., etc. Considering the 118 minute running time, I don't see where a minute was wasted in telling the tale. Some of the complaints I've been reading here are about what more explanation the story needs. The-Powers-That-Be have cut it to its current length. We'll have to wait for a longer version.<br /><br />I don't get all the complaining! One person says there are too many characters and the scope is too large; but T4 is a world war. Other people refer to the original films as being better somehow, and I heartily DISAGREE. I confess! I've never liked Arnold's Austrian-accented \\"witticisms\\", and I also did not enjoy him as a \\"good guy\\" in T2. T1 was better, but that was a long time ago. Now that everybody has been schooled on the foundations of the Terminator saga, it's time to step up to the next level of the story. T4's director, McG, did just that, and very well, IMO.
0446567337|3.0|This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  I felt like the story dragged on a little and just had some fillers.  I usually love his books, but I felt like this one was pretty predictable.  It was entertaining though, and I did enjoy it for the most part.  I just didn't feel satisfied that I got much out of the spending the whole day reading it.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book after perusing it at the library. I soon realized that it is priceless in that it explains the why and how as well as the what of cookery. Child's technique of presenting a master recipe then explaining on how simple additions or techniques make it something different allows a relatively inexperienced cook to see how the chemistry of cooking works. This book is nonthreatening and the illustrations are precise and not artsy. Using this book I have prepared dished I never had previously with success. It is  volume well worth having and using.
B002WOZKY8|5.0|I think that whether music is good or not is largely based on personal opinion but I loved Justin Bieber's My World.  I think his voice is beautiful and the songs are very catchy.  Personally I think his career could go very far and I look forward to hearing everything he does in the future.  He seems like a great kid and you should definitely purchase this album in support of him, I think it's great for any age!
0385737947|5.0|I actually read the first books of James Dashner's \\"13th Reality\\" series, The Journal of Curious Letters, a couple of years ago and was quite impressed.  Then my library never got the 2nd book, so I sorta forgot about him for a while, until everyone in the whole world started talking about The Maze Runner.  And.... Whoohoo!  What a story.  Imagine you wake up in a dark elevator-type thing, rising slowly for a long long time (like, half an hour) and you have no idea where you are... or WHO you are.  Thomas has zero memory when the elevator (The Box) deposits him in The Glade, a large area enclosed between  4 hundred-foot-high stone walls.  It is large enough for a few rough buildings, a small forest and a farm, of sorts.  And living there are about 50 or 60 other boys, all who arrived at The Glade via the box, with an equal lack of memories.  Outside the walls is an enormous, ivy-covered maze, which appears to have no exit.  Every night the doors in the walls close to enclose the boys in The Glade, and protect them from terrible creatures that lurk in the Maze.  Why are they there?  How did they get there?  And more importantly, how do they get out?  No one knows.
B002E01MB0|4.0|The censors were probably upset by a little thigh, but passed Alfred's film for presentation to adult audiences.  How times have changed!  Even commercials are infinitely more disgusting that \\"39 Steps.\\"<br />I will not bore the gentle reader with a recount of the plot which can be found in the insert or on Wikipedia.<br />Some reviewers panned the film quality, but I found it acceptable in both picture and soundtrack.  Maybe I am too easy to please, but I would rather view an old Hitchcock than most modern video release on HD.  Essential Art House did an adequate job, considering.<br />Watch for Alfred about seven minutes into the film.  I missed him the first two times.  Darn it!<br />This film was a favorite of Holden Caufield in Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" also available from Amazon.
B001DIDUHS|5.0|I have a special fondness for this album, maybe that's why it seems so powerful and moving -- I don't really know why.  It came out when I was in college, and thusly, I was definitely in a different state of mind.  No, I am not referring to medicinal influences.  It was just a unique time in my life as I had set out on my own and was just discovering some of the best music available out there... Thank goodness for friends who know what the heck they're talking about, and especially bless those that have a gifted affinity for knowing what you will like....    From the opening slow powerful plod of the title song Headless Cross, to the catchy Devil and Daughter, to the epic ballad of When Death Calls (starts off melancholy and depressing, and then crescendos into a powerful rock ballad that stays with you), all the way to Black Moon and Nightwing, this album is one of the best \\"lost treasures\\" of the Black Sabbath legacy.    Yes, it gets a little slow with the Kill in the Spirit World and Call of the Wild, but it's definitely a solid album with Tony Martin singing the lead. Just a beautiful album all around with some very memorable lyrics and melodies that kind of got left behind in the wake of Ozzy and Ronnie James Dio.    A Black Sabbath album that is a definite must-have --- and it's unavailable?!!>?? What a shame!!! You know what they say: beg, borrow, or steal it, butcha gotta get it.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar was beyond doubt, and without a close competitor, the most spectacular movie that I've seen. Even in flatscreen it would likely have been dazzling; in 3-D it was simply breathtaking. The world Pandora was like Oz and Wonderland and Middle Earth blended together, but far transcended any of those other places.<br /><br />On top of the visual feast, the story was good, too; after the initial set-up of the plot, there literally was not a slow moment in the movie. It was, however, very much a political and a religious statement in favor of Green and Gaian principles. These were presented so compellingly, however, that even the strong Republican-Evangelicals with whom I watched the movie cheered for the natives trying to save their homes from, and the rouge humans who helped them in their struggle against, the strip-mining corporation ready to ruin a world for its natural resources.<br /><br />Aside from its politico-religious aspects, the story was one that Edgar Rice Burroughs and his imitators have written over and over: an outcast human finds redemption, purpose, and fulfillment on a hostile and hazardous alien world. Seldom, however, has the story been told better than James Cameron told it, and never has it been illustrated more gorgeously. The next movie that I see will be Avatar -- I hope still in 3-D.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I'm a hardcore trekkie from the beginning, who's seen everything Trek multiple times.  I don't have much to add to the other 1 star reviews, except for a couple of things I didn't see mentioned by others.  Is it my imagination, or were there no opening credits to this movie along with theme music?  I only remember seeing credits of who was in the movie at the end, but nothing at the beginning.  And there was no theme, like Star Trek the Motion picture, etc. had.  Where is James Horner or Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?  Also, Kirk as a kid in the sports car, did you all notice the stupid NOKIA plug?  Outrageous!  I was expecting next to see Coca Cola logos on the bridge.  Speaking of which, the interior of the ship looked nothing like it should have, like in the original Star Trek.  They also changed the personalities of most of the characters.  I found it most fascinating that someone can go from cadet to first officer to thrown off the ship to captain in a few short days!  This is by far the worst Trek movie.  Please, make another Next Generation movie and jettison this whole sorry affair.
0810970686|5.0|I'm always happy when something gets my children to read instead of playing video games.  I'm glad that this series is so successful.  The books have been consistently good and stories are still very interesting (even to adults), so kudos to the author for continuing to write quality books.  The \\"Look Inside\\" feature of the books on Amazon should give the person interested in checking the book out a good look at the style of the book.  It will not disappoint.
1591840562|4.0|The Art of the Start is a very well written, thought provoking book. I read it from cover to cover. I like the idea that many references to other sources are included. This book takes a look from the financing side of a business venture.  I recommend that every potential business owner read it as part of their business education.<br /><br />My version of The Art of the Start was bundled in with [[ASIN:B000WMQYLA Business Plan Pro 15th Anniversary Edition]] which is a helpful tool to use when you start to write your business plan. If you are seriously considering starting a business and/or writing a business plan this book is one you should read before you begin.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Many Blu-ray releases are slipshod, lazy affairs designed to cash in on great films. But when the big studios make a concerted effort to get it right, pull out all the stops, and go to town on making the best high definition transfers possible, then Blu-ray shines: \\"North By Northwest\\" is one of those examples (another recent release, \\"Gone With The Wind\\", is another fantastic example). The fantastic full-screen transfer offers a spotless print, with wonderfully intense blacks and rich and vivid colour.<br /><br />In many ways \\"North By Northwest\\" needs no introduction. It is quintessential Hitchcock: the ever suave Cary Grant is pursued by sinister and yet urbane James Mason and hooks up with Eve Marie Saint in a slickly paced thriller with brilliant set-pieces in a cornfield and atop Mount Rushmore. It's possibly Hitchcock's best film (although critics would have you believe that's \\"Vertigo\\"), and in any case deserves the blu ribband treatment. This is one of the few really great older films to be on Blu-ray, and you need to own it if you have a Blu-ray player. It's that simple.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|...yet not without occasional dark tones too, making it the absolute perfect mixture. Like other reviews said this is great music to pray to, but if you just wanna listen ta some classy stuff, maybe entertain a date with your musical sophistication, my suggestion is to burn this along with the 'John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman' album onto a CD then put it on random. Trust me. Its the most perfect mixture of instrumental jazz an' traditional ballads with a soft, velvet-voiced crooner that you can fit into an hour. Do it! Peace, y'all.
B00005A46T|5.0|all right this cd came fast.this cd is the best slipknot cd ever.i listened to all the slipknot cds and i say this one is the best.the crazy masked that they use in this are pretty good i motley like is Corey Tyler's(the zombie with dreadlocks).i loved people = s***,my plague,everything ends, etc.they were all good because Corey Tyler sings them.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Wow, totally dig this flash! After using the built in flash since owning my D40 (& not being happy with the results alot of times!) for 2 yrs, this is so refreshing & inspiring! I saw reviews on amazon with photos of what this flash does & it's totally delivered :) Beautiful results from bouncing the flash off the ceiling. This was one big easy step in furthering my photog hobby skills!
B0019LY5IM|3.0|I'm as big a Lost fan as any, and I don't want to discourage other Lost fans from buying this DVD box set. Simply put, if you love Lost, then the season 5 DVD is a must-buy. The show itself definitely deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I feel I need to point out a few flaws here with this box set that weren't present in the other box sets (hence my 3-star review). First off and most noticeable, the packaging does not conform to the packaging set forth by the first four season DVDs of the show. Rather than the clear plastic slipcase that loads from the top, here you get a cardboard box that loads from the side. Also, as I think a few others might have noticed, the snaps in the trays seem to be somewhat faulty, as mine had three or four of the prongs snapped off when I first opened the box set, letting my disk 5 slide around freely.<br /><br />Another big disappointment is the fact that this box set is only 5 disks, even though it's no shorter than season 4, which had 6 disks. And two of season 4's disks were devoted to bonus features, while only one season 5 disk has bonus features, and they're sharing space with the final episode of the season. While all the standbys are there (Lost on location, deleted scenes), there certainly aren't as many special features here as Lost fans have grown accustomed to. It is a bit skimpy in that regard.<br /><br />Also, though it might not be a major issue with many people, this season 5 box set seems to have significantly fewer easter eggs hidden within than the previous seasons did. While I found at least 16 hidden easter eggs tucked away on season 4's two bonus disks, I've only managed to find 4 on season 5. And believe me when I say I've searched thoroughly.<br /><br />All this said, absolutely none of these things are a deal breaker, and if you're a Lost fan, you MUST get this DVD. But I thought that you Lost devotees out there deserved a fair warning; prepared to be a little disappointed with the features, especially compared to what we've gotten the past few years.few years.
B001GGY3WS|5.0|Anyone who compares Marillion with Genesis should have their ears cleaned out. Not only does Fish possess a better singing voice than Peter Gabriel or Phil Collins, he writes better lyrics. Musically speaking they are light years apart. They just got tagged with that comparison because Fish wore make-up on stage, and some of Mark Kelly's keyboard sounds are similar to that of Tony Banks. The album contains so much raw emotion you can't help but get into it if you like prog rock.
B00164KYV4|3.0|So it shipped off as a couple's movie, but the screen went black as a really weird movie.    Okay, there's an all-star cast, and I suppose they tried their best. The plot is weak and flickers half-heartedly, with little surges at a heart-touching moment ending up ruined. I felt like the director and the writers and everybody had a great idea, but it just got bogged down with weird plot twists and dull dialog.    I sat down to watch this movie, expecting something much more light and, well, romantic. It looks and sounds like a cute movie. Yet the humor they stab just ends up making us cringe, and the \\"truths\\" they sift in their about men and women are all, frankly, stupid and unrealistic.    The movie makes men look like disgusting dogs, and women look like lousy Bambi-eyed stupidheads, in a third grader's words. It had a heart, trust me, but it's just very bizarre. Like, let's watch a man fall in love with a not-so-innocent blond, or a hopeless girl fall in love several times, only to learn from a male friend that each one isn't interested, and gives her dating tips (which seems weird on its own). I mean, I feel like there's too many characters in an overly-complicated, weird plot that just doesn't click with me.    So if this is such a horrible movie, why did I rate it more than one star? Because it's honestly not a horrible movie. It started out good, but kinda degraded (it really lost me with the man-leaving-his-wife-for-the-younger-girl part). It has a few touching parts, granted, and though a nontraditional ending, it's still predictable and feels kinda hollow. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can watch it if you like, but don't buy it. I don't plan on watching it again- and just be ready for a cliche, bizarre movie stamped with the false \\"funny/romance\\" sticker on its spine.
B00004W3L3|5.0|This is one of the greatest concept out there. If you know anything at all about Marillion , You should own this Cd. Excellent musical performances by all involved, and the usual astonishingly great lyrics of then frontman FISH.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am very pleased I bought this entire series and the price was absolutely fantastic! So I got Christmas money and I bought this right away. I am very pleased I did too I am loving watching all the episodes again plus I had missed the last 2 seasons when it originally aired because I had my own stuff going on at the time. I did purchase the first two seasons, but decided to sell them off and now I have all the seasons together and the movies too! I am happy with this and I know it will be a series I will watch over and over.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Wow this epic heavy metal album from 30 years  ago still sounds like its new.  ENOUGH SAID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002RVZV9K|2.0|First off, Jack White doesn't deserve a place in this film. Everything about his \\"persona\\" is irritating to me.     I like a few White Stripes and Ranconteurs songs... but overall, he's too over-rated for my tastes.     The whole child version of himself watching him play, dressed in similar clothes.... meh... Seems way too contrived.     When they finally get to meeting each other, it is cool to see them play their riffs in a group setting. Page playing Ramble On solo is a highlight for sure.     Edge is cool... he goes back through his demo tapes of riffs from Joshua Tree, but really nothing new if you have seen the Classic Albums JT dvd.     Overall a good rental I guess, but I wouldn't buy this for $20. Rent it first and decide for yourself.
0882709194|1.0|On hearing, via YouTube, about the latest campaign of 'spreading the Word' by the Comfort/Cameron wayofthemaster tag team, I was more than amused to find that Comfort wrote a 'special introduction' to Darwin's Origin of the Species--which was being peddled by Ray himself no less at most of North America's universities.  So when I heard that devotees had recently handed out copies at my local Canadian university, I thought I'd give it a read and a review.<br /><br />I want to start by asking: how is writing a 'special intro' to Darwin's Origin--where there is an attempt to disparage his great work (and biological evolution generally) have anything to do with the mission and statement of faith of the ministry that Comfort is part of?  My guess is that they, and other like-minded evangelists see evolution as undermining potential recruits (saving souls) to their cause and so by attempting to undermine evolution, they will automatically gain support for creationism (false dichotomy) and recruits.<br /><br />After a brief history of Darwin's life, a timeline and some points about his religious beliefs, Comfort completes the rest of the introduction by getting us up to speed on \\"... some of the areas of continued controversy\\" (of Darwin's theory).  Instead of controversy, what we really get are familiar, tired arguments based on false analogies, outdated evidence and decades-old quote-mining as to why evolution, or 'Darwinism' is a theory in crisis, etc.  (We even get the Hitler card played.)<br /><br />Comfort immediately begins by discussing the human genome and likens it to a 1000 book encyclopedia set.  Then he wants us to imagine this 'encyclopedic genome' (3 billion base pairs) coming together by chance.  Unfortunately, this genome-as-encyclopedia analogy is completely false.  The reason being is that there is so much duplication, repetition and non-coding sections in our genome that it is entirely *unlike* a well-written (spelling and grammar mistake-free) encyclopedia set.  After reading 'Relics of Eden' by research geneticist, Daniel J. Fairbanks, I found that our genome is filled with non-functioning pseudogenes, deletions, chromosome rearrangements, duplications, chromosomal fissioning, fusions, exons, introns, mutations, gene conversions, inversions, recombinations, transposons, repetitions, etc.  The number of pseudogenes in our genome exceeds the number of real genes!  For instance, we, and all primates have a non-functioning vitamin C-making GLUO gene; whereas cats and dogs have a functioning one.<br /><br />Everywhere in our genome, and in the comparison of it with other primate genomes, a clear pattern of descent from common ancestry emerges.  What evolutionary genetic analysis shows is that chimps and bonobos are more closely related to us than either chimpanzees or us are to gorillas.  Contrary to Comfort's citing that our genome is only 96% identical to a chimp's, Fairbanks states that the exons in most active genes are more than 99% identical (p85).  And \\"... more than 99% of the millions of retroelements in both genomes are in the same position, confirming that the majority of all transposable element insertions preceded the divergence that gave rise to the human and chimp lineages.\\" (p92).  Additionally, we have retro-viral DNA (DNA inserted by ancient viruses) in our genomes that matches the same descent patterns as other genetic sequences found in us and our primate cousins.<br /><br />Saying that genomes come together by chance completely shows that Comfort has no understanding of how natural selection, and evolution works.  Chance mutations happen which creates variance in offspring's traits.  If this confers some advantage to individuals, those variations are retained and passed on to the next generation.  Advantageous traits--adaptation--accumulates in a population.  It is a combination of chance mutation and selection that apparently builds complex organisms and an elegantly messy genome.  (How many times does this have to get pointed out?)<br /><br />The equating of our designs with Nature's 'designs' or processes is another (old) false analogy as he tries to show in his argument that because a biplane and a jet have similar features doesn't indicate that they evolved from each other without a maker.  Organisms grow from a single cell; they develop organs, etc.  Human designs are constructed and planned.  Saying that a common designer would use a common 'blueprint' is just speculation when trying to explain genomic similarities.  The problem here is in explaining all the useless, non-functioning sections of the genome (i.e. non-functioning vitamin C gene) that get passed down and all the kludgy, non-optimal 'designs' we see in organisms.  Explaining the non-information of the genome is the real problem.<br /><br />Regarding his section on transitional forms: there is no such thing.  My thinking is that it's an artifact of fossil discovery.  Every organism--dead or alive--is a transitional form.  Comfort then retorts that feathered dinosaurs have been 'debunked.'  He cites the National Geographic hoax and one scientist's opinion.  I searched Wikipedia and talkorigins and found more than 20 genera of feathered dinosaurs.  Amazon lists about 30 books on feathered dinosaurs.  Whale evolution is another topic that gets misrepresented where he typically counts on readers ignorance. Any quick web search easily shows there are lots of 'transition' fossils showing clear evolution over millions of years.<br /><br />Comfort quote mines from the Origin on the puzzle of the eye's complexity (p186 of Origin, 1st edition), which is funny as it allows one to look up the text immediately after the quote, clearly demonstrating how creationists take quotes out of context.  His subsequent discussion on the eye is equally wrong.<br /><br />The intro ends with his pre-rehearsed preaching and a pompous conclusion (based on a red herring analogy) that Christianity is the best religion! compared to the other three: Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.  How is this is relevant to the Origin?<br /><br />I just have to say that this is the worst, disingenuous, cowardly, misinformational and outright lying intro I've ever read.  And it is made all the worst as Darwin is not alive to comment on this intro or defend his work.  No Darwinist, evolutionist, or atheist for that matter would add an intro like this to the Bible.

Yep, the one on TV is a version of this toy, recast and hand-finished.    Too much fun.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|I had to write a review since I just finished watching the first season of this wonderful series. A lot of people have written regarding what this BBC period drama is about. I won't go into particulars, but I just want to say that I truly enjoyed this series. It so well made. The costumes, the casting, the little things were all there. You felt like you were a part of both communities while you watched it. You cared for the characters like they were your friends. This is great TV. There needs to be more of this type of programming on American television. If you are thinking of buying this series, do it, you will not be disappointed!!
B000EYK4GW|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A very short (~60 minutes) animated film by Disney that lacks the scope and ambition of the studio's more accomplished efforts, Dumbo isn't bad per se but it's a rather unimpressive story that will appeal more to children than their more-discerning parents.    2.5/4

B00003CX8U|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Something of a musical reimagining of 81/2 (but actually interesting and engaging) that depicts a Fosse-like character (played by a fabulous Roy Scheider) as he moves closer to the grave, All That Jazz occasionally feels self-indulgent--how could it not?--but contains some standout musical sequences and a lot of compelling material; it's imperfect but very interesting even to people like myself who don't typically like musicals.    3.5/4

It seemed like there were a lot of main characters, but that was okay, because the plot flowed nicely, and I got to know each character pretty well.<br /><br />Overall, THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB was very enjoyable and extremely cute. It is a great book about the meaning of friends, especially while in a relationship. A great debut!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Ashley B
B002RSDW80|2.0|This is a real sloppy mess of a movie, one that is far too ambitious and fails in virtually all of its goals. I'd give it one star, but that seems a little cruel. Where to start with this film's many faults?    1) Julia Child clearly led a life interesting enough to be worthy of a movie all of her own, and yet she has to share the spotlight with a frustrated up and coming New York blogger who decides to cook her way through Child's cookbook within a year. The constant switching back and forth doesn't really work.    2) By her own high standards, Streep acts poorly. Adopting a fake accent and twisting your face into paroxysms of delight every time you come across French food does not a great performance make.    3) The film treats Child with too much reverence and makes little effort to explain her motivation. Sure, she was bored abroad, and sure, she liked cooking, but that applies to a lot of other people too. What really made her tick? We don't learn.    4) The direction sucks. I'm sorry, but there is no polite way to say this. The film is far too long and there is no sense of tension to drive it forwards. It has all the dynamism of a napping hamster. We are treated to an endless cycle of \\"This happened in France, and then that happened, and here we are in New York, and this happened, and that happened, and here we are back in France\\". It could easily have lost 30 minutes without anyone noticing. Oh look, here we are, watching Julia discussing her book in a most boring fashion yet again with her French co-writers. Cut, cut, cut.         I believe I am in a small minority here, but I thought the one part of the movie that did work was the part which focussed on blogger Julie Powell. The tale of a frustrated writer stuck in a stressful and unfulfilling job was well told and made sense and -- crucially -- we could understand her motivation.         You won't miss much by skipping Julie and Julia.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|The story goes that when [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] was first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.<br /><br />The rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.<br /><br />The beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.<br /><br />The first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.  Will a persistent  [[ASIN:1560978074 Dennis]] finally melt Mr. Wilson's icy heart?...  Uh, that is, will a persistent Russell finally melt Mr. Fredericksen's icy heart?  Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?<br /><br />Do you really have to ask?<br /><br />The second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning short [[ASIN:B00005JKDR For the Birds]].  This produces lots of funny jokes, but at the expense of any remaining plausibility,...<br /><br />and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embittered [[ASIN:B00005JKU0 Captain Nemo]], a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.  This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.<br /><br />Finally, this movie gets an \\"F\\" for its understanding of the problems of [[ASIN:0684856026 Cryptozoology]].  As a practical matter, in order to protect a rare and endangered animal you first have to prove that it exists, and that ultimately requires a specimen.  If you can bring it in alive, so much the better, but bring it in you must.  As one by no means heartless or cruel scientist investigating Bigfoot put it, we need a body.  The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.  Now, it is perfectly understandable that people would be squeamish about this idea when we are talking about, at the very least, a  [[ASIN:B000MRNWKG man-like creature]], what Edgar Rice Burroughs would call an [[ASIN:0786408251 anthropoid ape]], but it is sheer idiocy to take this attitude about a giant bird that in real life would have been following Russell and Mr. Fredericksen...<br /><br />in order to kill and eat them.plausibility,...    and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embittered [[ASIN:B00005JKU0 Captain Nemo]], a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.

B002SVBDYQ|5.0|To be honest, I never thought I'd buy anything related to Twilight. After seeing Twilight and New Moon and hearing the music in both, I couldn't help myself. This soundtrack is _very_ listenable. And really... Muse, Thom Yorke, Editors, The Killers, Death Cab.... you can't go wrong.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|The music is great. The camera and production directors were terrible and probably shouldn't direct another concert again.
B002BKIERI|4.0|My motivation for getting LD was after having heard Snatam Kaur perform two of the selections from the recording at a concert (I didn't know they were from that CD - I was listening to the music for the first time.) I was immediately and deeply moved by them.    Every recording contains particular songs that \\"grab\\" us, that we just \\"have to have.\\" The two that knocked me over upon first hearing were \\"Pritham Bhagaautee\\" and \\"Ardas Bhayee.\\" The former is so full of joy, it infuses the listener with overflowing happiness and ecstasy. The latter reminded me of the melodic structure of the Pachelbel Cannon - it's very sweet, heartfelt, and touching - and easy to sing along to!    I imagine I will never ever get tired of listening to those two songs and to be touched in a soulful way.    I wanted to say, that like all of the recordings I have heard by SK, including the recording from a live performance, this package is put together very professionally. The recording is tight, the sound engineering is excellent as are the inner liner notes which contains a stylish cover, done in the script, I suppose of Gurmukhi, and all lyrics are not only provided, but translated into English. The use of vocal dubbing of Snatam's voice is exquisite (check out the higher notes she hits in \\"Servant of Peace\\").    Lots of interesting instruments used in this recording, including the use of the cello, esraj, santoor, and sarod, just to mention a few. The use of the esraj, I think, is the one which is used to create a haunting mournful sound throughout many of the selections. (Listen to all the instruments used in \\"Pritham Bhagaautee!\\" The way they are used creates an ecstatic effect! This song is one in which the use of traditional drums, or at least the use of the cymbals, is put to excellent effect, a percussion sound that would not be captured by the use of the tabla alone.)    The performance and combination of musicians and instrumentation is excellent. This recording contains a variety of styles, ranging from slow hymns sung in both English and Gurmukhi, to the more upbeat ones. \\"Liberation's Door\\" rocks (as does a section of \\"Servant of Peace\\")!     I was surprised to read on the inner booklet back cover that one of the listed instruments was \\"drums and percussion.\\" At times, the more contemporary use of drums can be heard. I mention this, because I am more used to hearing the use of the tabla for this kind of genre, and the use of the drums makes for more of a secular/popular treatment, particularly during a segment of \\"Servant of Peace,\\" where the style turns this piece from a more traditional chant to what sounds like a more contemporary pop-style music. (This is the first song on the recording and I was concerned that the whole recording was going to be in this style - fortunately, it is limited to just one portion of this song. When I put this in context of this selection and the other songs on the recording, the more contemporary/Western pop style of drum is tolerable. I listen to the music of SK to tap into the more traditional sound of chanting, not for a more contemporary airing - occassional veering off is ok for me, and she does a good job of combining the \\"sacred\\" with the \\"secular.\\" \\"Servant of Peace\\" is a good example of how she has combined both genres into an uplifting song. Note my later comment about the use of drums in \\"Pritham Bhagaautee.\\")    The inclusion of lyrics in the small pamphlet that comes with the package (no jewel case for this CD and booklet,) is important, because it allows you to follow along as SK sings and understand the meaning of the words. Hearing her pronounce the words helps with understanding how they should be sung. (Given the excellence of the entire production and packaging of this product, I was surprised to note a few misspellings of simple English words in the provided lyric booklet.)    To my ear, all the selections on this CD are enjoyable, some much more than others. I've mentioned my two favorites by far.    I prefer to hear SK's voice as the primary voice and a male voice(s) as backup. On the cuts \\"Servant of Peace,\\" \\"Liberation's Door,\\" and \\"Mother's Blessing,\\" the sound of Manish Vyas's voice alternates with SK's. His vocal quality is quite different from that of SK. Some people may like it. When I first heard it, it added to the more \\"authentic\\" sacred nature of the chanting, and after awhile, I preferred for the voice to be used more in the background. Just a small quibble!    When I first read the lyrics to the first selection, \\"Servant of Peace,\\" I was disappointed that so much of it was in English, but in fact, the singing time seems equally devoted to singing the song in Gurmukhi, followed by the St. Francis of Assisi English words, and the presence of both languages serves the way in which this song is delivered. The use of both languages made the song more interesting. I imagine how it would have been been sung in just Gurmukhi, or English, and both would have been fine, too!    I wanted to add that the very interesting thing about \\"Servant of Peace\\" (don't read this if you want to be surprised by your first hearing of this piece!) is that it starts out as a traditional formal chant, then switches over to English chanting in a more contemporary musical style, and then opens up to a joyous melodic outpouring, closing with a quiet finish.    There is a beautiful inclusion of some Enya-sounding vocal overdubbing of choral voices at the end of \\"Crimson\\" which adds to the beauty of its rendition.    Most of the rest of the music is sung in Gurmukhi, with the exception of \\"Mother's Blessing\\" which is sung in English and Spanish.    All words to the songs on this recording are beautiful and heartfelt. I gave this recording a 4, rather than a 5, due to my subjective reaction to the melodies of a few selections - while they were pleasant (\\"Mother's Blessing\\"), they didn't strike me as having the same degree of colorful interest as some of her other music (highly subjective of course - I know some people \\"love\\" the song \\"Mother's Blessing.\\" Lyrically, it is beautiful. Melodically, it didn't grab me that much.)    SK fans will love this recording and I imagine each will have his/her own favorites on it due to the wide variety of musical styles.    \\"Har Har Ram Das Guru Hai\\" will have you singing along. Great instrumentation, great vocals, and blissful choral vocal overdubbing of SK's voice.    This recording can be listened to in various modes - as pleasant background music, contemporary pop music, and for the more contemplative and ecstatic effect.     Upon third listening (as background music), I am enjoying the cut \\"LD\\" and more.  I also noticed the presence of more jazz stylings than I can recall on any other song I have heard by her. Also noticed some interesting multiple vocal overdubbings of her voice. Performances are really well done. Come to think of it, some of the other cuts on this recording sound more enjoyable (like \\"Har Har Ram Das Guru Hai\\"). \\"Charan Sat Sat\\" is one of the more simpler sounding chants - pleasant on the level it is delivered.    For all SK fans, if you have not heard \\"Servant of Peace,\\" \\"Pritham Bhagaautee,\\" and/or \\"Ardas Bhayee,\\" you will be reminded why you love this musician so much. The last two songs, in particular are SO SO special, it reminded me of the huge difference that sacred music has over some secular music that is written from a different source of inspiration in affecting one's ability to connect to that inner holy source.

B000FZETKC|5.0|Of all the 80s movies I have seen this seems to be the one that stands the test of time. All of the others seem to have the styles of the 80s dominate and not let the story shine. Mary Stuart Masterson steals the show with her great performance. She captures the hurt so wonderfully with just her eyes. Kudos to them for not taking the easy way out and making Amanda Jones a terrible person and easily hated.

B0000017CA|5.0|Acid Bath rose from the Louisiana swamps during the height of the grunge era (1991) and after releasing a series of demo tapes, unleashed their epic debut album upon an unsuspecting public. Boasting album artwork from infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy, it isn't a surprise than Acid Bath offer dark, nihilistic lyrics to go hand in hand with their dark music. What makes Acid Bath so unique is their versitality, they borrow sounds and ideas from a few other sources put piece them together in a way that gives them their own sound.<br /><br />\\"When The Kite String Pops\\", despite being an independent affair, boats thunderous production values and sound quality. This album has en epic, crushing sound that does the music justuce. The musicianship and playing are competent, but not very technical. Acid Bath go more for a dark, violent atmosphere than a sonic assault. Sammy Duet and Mike Sanchez are the guitarists here and i have no complaints as far as their skills. They are perfect for the slow, sludgy sound of the music. Bassist Audie Pitre is very audible in the mix due to the bass heavy production and Jimmy Kyle holds his own behind the kit.<br /><br />Vocalist Dax Riggs is incredible here, he goes from a soothing croon to a violent scream in mere seconds. This is as powerful of a vocal performence as you're bound to get on a metal record, Dax sounds possessed. The lyrics are bleak, violent and very disturbing. They mostly revolve around murder, anti-religion and plain bizarre imagery. They fit the music like a glove. Opener \\"The Blue\\" is a highlight with a crushing slow riff and some of the most powerful vocals on the album. \\"Cheap Vodka\\", \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Tranquelized\\" are rockers that somewhat recall Alice In Chains, but even more depressing. On the other side of the spectrum, \\"Scream Of The Butterfly\\" and \\"The Bones Of Baby Dolls\\" showcase the acoustic, melodic side of the band. Acid Bath are anything but a one trick pony.<br /><br />At 69 minutes and 14 songs, \\"When The Kite String Pops\\" is a little too long. Though there isn't any filler, it begins to drag after a while. Had it been 11 or so songs, it might be a little stronger. Even so, Acid Bath are one of metal's best kept secrets. Due to the fact they disbanded before they became known nationwide, they remain more of a local favorite than anything. In 1996 the band would release their second, more melodic album \\"Paegan Terrorism Tactics\\", afterwards bassist Audie Pitre was killed in a car accident which signaled the end of the band. Both albums are equally good, but \\"Kite String\\" is an essential New Orleans metal album, and an essential sludge metal album period.ops\\" is a little too long.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is a Pixar masterpiece; the animation astounds me and the plot is very engaging--you won't get bored! There's action, adventure, scenes that evoke genuine emotion and lots of good one-liners and even a few \\"sight gags,\\" too. The actors doing the voiceovers were chosen with care and the flow of the movie is very good--the plot unfolds smoothly without becoming too fast or too slow. The script was well written, too. The film even explores the themes of friendship and the universal struggle between good and evil; that's very impressive.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet two employees of Monsters, Inc., a power plant in the city of Monstropolis which, by the way, is populated only by monsters who scare children. There's James Sullivan aka \\"Sully\\" (voiced by John Goodman) and his buddy Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sullivan is number one at scaring children; but his not-so-friendly coworker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi) is a competitor for the number one slot. Other monsters working at Monsters, Inc. include the boss of it all, Henry Waternoose (voiced by James Coburn); Celia the receptionist (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) and Roz (voiced by Bob Peterson), a cranky older monster who's a stickler for paperwork! Roz is not too happy with Mike because he never seems to file his paperwork correctly--or even on time!<br /><br />At Monsters, Inc., monsters generate power similar to electricity by entering children's bedrooms in the human world at night through closet doors to make the kids scream in horror! Unfortunately, however, Monstropolis has a problem; the monsters are just not producing enough power from the children's screams. Another interesting thing is that the kids don't know that the monsters are actually quite afraid--of them! The monsters believe that human children are extremely frightening--and the kids could easily be toxic, too!<br /><br />A big problem eventually arises when James accidentally lets a two year old child into the world of Monstropolis. The state police-like Child Detection Agents need to capture the child and send it back to its home before the child might infect, harm or even kill a monster! James and Mike go through many trials and tribulations just to keep track of the playful and often hard to catch child; and we get quite a few unexpected plot twists and turns before the movie ends!<br /><br />The two DVD version of this film offers us a plethora of extra features which are truly wonderful. On the first disc, there is the choice between viewing the film in widescreen or fullscreen, although you can only get the audio commentary and the 5.1 surround sound effects mix when you watch this in widescreen format.

B002JCSWUW|2.0|I can't believe the overwhelming praise for this movie. Sure, it scores as a feel-good sports flick, but that's about it I'm afraid. I believe it fails on two major fronts. First, this film does not portray the game of rugby very well, especially at the top level. The players in the movie looked like they were playing in a fourth-grade club match, not a test; there was only one backline move in the whole game, the 'scissors', that was shown again and again; and when the players came off the field they looked as if they had just done the gardening, not played 80 minutes of intense rugby, ready to throw their guts out. Why didn't the director make the players run around the block five times, then walk on to the movie set so they as least they would have looked somewhat knackered? The semi-final against France was a match of the highest drama, with the French denied a try in the dying seconds, tackled short of the line, that would have won them the game. This film showed nothing of that drama. And the Haka, or war dance, was pathetic to say the least. The second failure I thought was a reluctance to show the history of Apartheid,as this was indeed the background to the whole film. There was so reference to the Soweto uprisings of the 1970s nor of the sport and trade boycotts of South Africa. I mean, it didn't even show Mandela walking out of prison. What a great opeing that would have been. A great chance I feel was lost to educate the world, especially Americans, about South Africa and its history, which would have enhanced the movie a great deal, and, of course, to educate the world about 'real' rugby. Better luck next time Clint.

B002R5V7MG|5.0|For those of us who have watched and listened to the magical rise of the young intensely musical Gustavo Dudamel from his first appearances in this country, and were fortunate enough to be present during his inaugural concerts as Music Director and Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic as well as his subsequent 2009 autumn concerts, this DVD of the young gentle giant in performance is a particular treasure. And while it is one thing to be present in the hall when Dudamel is conducting live, when the electricity and magnetism of his talent is so obvious, this memento is a very fine way to share his gifts. As with all recorded live performances, there are times when close-ups of the various orchestra players disrupt the flow and intensity of the music, but DGG has done a fine job with the acoustics and with the quality of photography, and they have given a generous amount of time to focusing on Dudamel as he shapes and molds and indulges in the music at hand.<br /><br />John Adams' 'City Noir' was commissioned for this occasion and Dudamel brings this rather thickly orchestrated work to life. More about that later. But the joy of the DVD is the brilliance of the performance of the Mahler First Symphony. Dudamel already channels Mahler like few other conductors, relishing the changing rhythms and tune variations in a manner that seems as though Mahler himself might be on the podium. He shapes the entire symphony with a finely tuned unified focus, allowing the symphony to unfold with every idiosyncrasy that makes Mahler so wondrous. His tempi are flexible, his pausing for phrases to develop is fascinating, and his physical communication with his orchestra is magically infectious.  There will always be those who say that no conductor can equal the old recorded performances by the past masters like Bruno Walter etc., but that is the type of response does not allow for the fact that Mahler is Mahler and when he is as fresh today under the baton of someone as musical as Gustavo Dudamel as he was over a hundred years ago, then it may be time to put away old prejudices and re-open the heart to the immediacy of music making.<br /><br />One aspect of Dudamel's new position with the Los Angeles Philharmonic that has endeared him to the orchestra and audiences alike is his selfless approach to the music which he demonstrates by forsaking the personal bows and instead, walking into the orchestra members to thank them and laud their performance.  Dudamel is a source of joy and a gift to the world of classical music.  This DVD captures that.

B00000AF98|4.0|KISS' fourteenth studio album, Crazy Nights (1987) is one that often gets overlooked by casual fans, gets bashed on by KISS army members, and one the band themselves seem to want nothing to do with anymore (since Eric Carr's passing this album has never been represented in a live show). It's easy to see why: it is very different from the KISS sound that people came to know and love. Rather formulaic, pop-friendly, synth-driven, and glossed-up production by Ron Nevison (who also worked his magic with Heart, Survivor, Jefferson Starship, Ozzy Osbourne, and Europe among others) make for an album that would make purists of Destroyer say, \\"WTF?\\"<br /><br />But here's something they've forgotten. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons are both there, and in spite of being produced and played in a style fans of the classics aren't used to, it's full of catchy hooks and equally catchy choruses. With this in mind, a majority of the songs are very much adapted to the 80's glam scene that was big at the time, but a few tracks are thoroughly reminiscent of the classic KISS sound. Take away Nevison's production on \\"Hell Or High Water\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" and you'll notice that they have the tempo and basic style that belongs on an early work (Hotter Than Hell is the first that comes to mind), while doing the same to \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" would make it seem right at home on Dressed To Kill.<br /><br />Almost every other song on this album is a highlight; in addition to the ones mentioned already, \\"Crazy Crazy Nights,\\" \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You,\\" \\"No No No,\\" \\"My Way,\\" \\"Reason To Live,\\" and \\"Turn On The Night\\" rank among my favorite KISS songs, with \\"Reason To Live\\" being my favorite ballad of theirs and \\"My Way\\" being my favorite song on the album (and the one most abundant with synths). The only reasons this gets 4.5 stars?<br /><br />First off, all the songs have pretty much the same formula: an 8-bar verse, an 8-bar bridge, and an 8-bar chorus. Sometimes it mixes it up, but not too often. If KISS continued on this formula, then I'd probably say that this and all KISS albums after it suck royally. However, this is the only time that this is used, so I'll give it more credit. Also, \\"Bang Bang You\\" may very well be the worst KISS song ever written. \\"I'm gonna bang bang you, shoot you down with my love gun baby...\\" okay, as much as i like the reference to a KISS classic, those are some of the worst lyrics I've ever read. Closer \\"Thief In The Night\\" also leaves a fair amount to be desired. But overall, this is a solid album that you should just accept for what it is. Is it anywhere near the debut or Dressed To Kill in terms of greatness? Absolutely not. But if you can't accept it for what it is and enjoy it to some extent, I feel you just aren't truly a KISS fan.S continued on this formula, then I'd probably say that this and all KISS albums after it suck royally.

0451169514|3.0|I am fairly new to King and his literature.  A friend of mine used to rave about older, more classic King novels, and I thought they were all just overly-hyped.  On a whim, I picked up a copy of Salem's Lot.  It was an amazing novel that captivated me from the start.  When i was halfway through it, I remembered my friend talking about IT.  I picked it up so i could start into it when i finished Salem's Lot.  I must say I was let down from reading IT.  For one, this is not an average novel.  It is over a thousand pages, so this takes a little dedication from most readers.  I'll try not to spoil anything with my following opinions.<br />  On a good side, the characters are well-developed, and the story is very easy to relate to.  Reading about the little boys playing made me think back to when i was ten or eleven.  The story is also quite frightening at times, and i enjoyed being freaked out by the book.  It also brings up long forgotten memories about how easy it is to be frightened when one is young.  When i would turn my reading lamp off to go to sleep, i would sometimes lay there for a while feeling a bit spooked out, so it did have enough horror in it to scare me.<br />  On a more negative side, the way the story is written out makes for a very confusing read at times.  The beginning confused me quite a bit, especially going from one time period to the other with the characters in each era having no real relation except by being plagued by IT.  The language at times was also a little too vulgar.  The kids seemed to have very adult minds at times.  I can't remember me or my friends talking like that when i was ten or eleven.  It is also known that King includes sexual things in some of his novels.  Having adult sexual themes is one thing, but having six young boys have sex with a young girl and going into graphic detail is just too much!  No film maker could ever include the scene that is discussed here, but for some reason its ok to describe it and let the reader imagine it in their heads.  I think he crossed a line there. But the scene between Patrick and Henry at the dump may have been even worse than that.<br />  My least favorite part of this book was the various Derry interludes.  At the beginning of the book they were much harder to really pick up on and connect with the story.  The historical background was ok, but it seemed almost extremely irrelevant for a long time while reading the interlude about the Black Spot burning down.  That one is long, and it doesn't really connect to the story in any understandable way until the very end of it.  It was honestly like reading a short story that was randomly sandwiched into the novel.<br />  King did a good job writing a story that at times really pulls in the reader, but at other times the story just seems like filler is inserted just to fill up space.  It seems like taking the story into the adult lives of the characters might not have really been necessary. One can easily imagine what kind of story could have been made if he had stuck to the story of the main characters as children.  A showdown with the silver slug bullets and all would have made for an exciting end.  Working so hard to finish this book really made the ending seem bad.<br />****  Spoiler alert  ****<br />Having IT not really be a monster at all but a lesser god-like being is just an odd twist.  It might have been better if he were just a shapeshifting monster.  And the \\"turtle\\" was confusing too.  Bringing in gods or whatever was just such a weird way to bring this book to a finish.  The final showdown just wasn't what i had hoped for.  The ending was confusing and really felt like a letdown.<br />  In conclusion, a few changes might have made the read a little more satisfying.  I found myself most pulled in when the story was focused on the lives of the children.  I was a little less into the story when it focused on the adults.  I was least satisfied when the Derry interludes were going on.  He strings all three of those different parts of the story out all the way to the end.  I don't want to discourage people from reading this book because it is a great read at times.  Just be prepared for what you might be getting into.  King is a great writer, and I think he got a little too ambitious with this story and didn't tie it up as well as he as could have.e of those different parts of the story out all the way to the end.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|This film is so special it hardly deserves to be labeled a romantic comedy. Gordon and Deschanel show off their acting talents by not showing us they're acting. The film is filled with realistic and extremely funny moments showing love and desire are not always the same thing, but how ones perception can be altered during a whirlwind romance. Zooey Deschanel is my new sweetheart and she shows no sign of slowing down. I'm not sure about her range, but she is as natural as one can be and fits perfectly into these quirky romance pictures. Gordon-Levitt is equally as good and I've been very impressed with his abilities in the films that I've seen him in. This one should please everyone, but mostly for those of us who long for something just a little bit different. '500 Days Of Summer' is insightful, funny and most important truthful!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I have have been using this unit for 2 weeks and am impressed with the improvement offered with indirect light bouncing off nearby surfaces vs the on-board unit. The SB-400's capability to aim the flash in multiple angles is not thoroughly detailed in store or official documentation when it is easily its greatest feature. I sometimes wish I whent with a flash with a bit more horsepower and twist aim, but I figured learning the art was more important than the gadget. Overall a simple no frills great improvement from my D5000's on board flash.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I have 2 movies that I simply love 1)Prince of Tides 2) Shawshank Redemption.  I could watch these two movies at least once a month and they would still have the same effect on me.  Regarding SR the acting of both actors was excellent.  The movie had such moving scenes I found myself cheering them on and crying at certain scenes.  I don't want to give anything away about this magnificent movie.  I will say that Morgan Freeman did an excellent job narrating the movie as well as playing the part of a convict that took responsibllity for his actions.  Tim Robbins was at his best in this movie.  Suggestion:  If you have never seen this movie please buy it.  It is worth every dime you would spend.

B0026J8LHM|2.0|I feel bad saying anything against these guys at all.They are, one of my favorite bands.I have owned this CD for a while and I think I have listened to it twice.The only song I listen to often is The Count Of Tuscany.     A band with this much talent will have their times where they experiment musically and try different things.  With this band's following, which is made up of musicians and people that are are NOT fly-by-night radio listeners, this Band can afford to experiment. Lets face it, there is always something there that is worth your money, and with their track record, I will gladly be the guinea pig.   These guys are Top-Notch musicians.They are heavily involved in music (and with their side projects-very heavily involved). I am almost 50 years old and I can say, there are things I listen to now that I thought was mediocre years ago. What I am trying to say is, keep this CD, listen to it now and then, maybe one day......we'll get it.

What should they cost?  How are costs determined?  Where do you go for authoritative, well informed, reliable advice?<br /><br />Whether you're a solicitor, barrister, judge, or cost draftsman, your first port of call could well be \\"Cook on Costs 2010\\", and it is for most professionals today.<br /><br />Michael Cook has long been known for his expertise in this complicated area which inevitably lends itself all too often to dissension and dispute.  But here you have Cook's up to date, authoritative and easily accessible work which focuses on the practical aspects of costs, with clear, straightforward explanation and examination of every aspect of the remuneration of solicitors and barristers for work done.<br /><br />Thoroughly and comprehensively, Michael Cook covers the entitlement and quantification of contentious and non-contentious legal business brilliantly, and it includes costs between the parties and family costs.  Private and public funding of litigation is also covered and the text is helpfully illustrated with decided cases, many of which you won't find in the law reports.  There are verbatim extracts from all landmark costs judgments and all the relevant statutes, rules and regulations governing civil costs are also included.<br /><br />Law Society President Michael Napier puts it succinctly thus: `the funding of litigation - whether the case can be funded and who pays what to whom at the end - has become a new and essential skill for litigators everywhere.'<br /><br />Fortunately \\"Cook on Costs\\" has been with us since 1991, and is now annual helping the profession `steer its way through the costs maze' very effectively.  Napier adds that due to the `dizzying pace of change', (recall that the law lords have disappeared and solicitors are no longer `of the Supreme Court' but `of the Senior Courts' to site only two examples) a reference work like this needs to be published yearly. So, that is what \\"Cook on Costs\\" actually is: the 2010 annual edition of this familiar title, which first came on the scene 19 years ago.<br /><br />\\"Cook on Costs 2010\\" is now an invaluable work of reference across the legal profession, including in addition to the straightforward pithy text, the tables of statutes...statutory instruments...Civil  Procedure Rules...Practice Directions about costs supplementing CPR Parts 43 to 48...non-statutory provisions...and cases, and also Michael Cook's great sense of descriptive humour.<br /><br />Of particular interest during these fraught times in the new decade of the 21st century remains the lengthy and detailed chapter (over 100 pages long) on conditional fees with almost certain change on the near horizon.  Read, note, digest and decide whether conditional fees in all their variants are the right route for you because it may be all change by the middle of the year!<br /><br />The law is stated in the 2010 edition as at 1st November 2009, and with the modern landscape of costs, Cook has kept pace with the dizzying change and we are all grateful to him for his wisdom and keen understanding of this perplexing aftermath of litigation.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-4057-4233-7wo examples) a reference work like this needs to be published yearly.

B002BGCCZC|5.0|I love music but hail back to the days of the 70s prog rock period when you listened to the album from beginning to end. There are few CDs today that match that period (not a knock but a recognition of the times.) So I was wonderfully surprised to pick up this CD while waiting for my wife and listened at full volume in my truck (which has a great sound system.) I was blown away. Powerful, sweeping, melodic, engaging. For the first time in a long while a CD to make my spine tingle. Something to listen - and enjoy - in it's entirety.    I could hear all sorts of influences - Queen, Rammstein, but so much more.     This is original and powerful work.    Now I have a pile of other Muse CDs to acquire and enjoy. Just glad I stumbled across this one.
1405742267|5.0|THE MAGISTRATES' COURT LAWCARDS FOR PROFESSIONALS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE with Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This is it - the latest Mags Court Guide bang up to date. It is the essential reference in one volume for practice and procedure linked a \\"lawcard\\" style system which I rather like for ease of use, with a concise commentary I need without going to \\"Stones\\" for the heavy case detail which I would use if the matter was complex and hard.<br /><br />So, if you're a practitioner in the Magistrates' Court, or you are associated professionally to the court in any way, you'll need this new guide on your shelf. All recent case law and legislation relevant to the Magistrates' Court is set out, including revised Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) sentencing guidelines covering burglary, theft and breach of ASBOs which will be great assistance to duty solicitors and the defence. Also published are the new SGC guidelines for statutory offences of fraud published on 13 October 2009 so it's as up to date as possible for 2010.<br /><br />There are comprehensive Tables of Cases, Statutes and Statutory Instruments and an extremely useful index at the back in a handy format similar to the cards the justices have o the Bench.  And there are sections on bail and indexes for crime, road traffic, family proceedings and sentencing.<br /><br />Practitioners agree that this succinct, logically structured work of reference provides guidance on key cases and practice developments and there is a wealth of new material and legislative changes you'll find summarized in the preface, notably such changes as the new Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO); Drinking Banning Orders (DBOs) and the Road Safety Act 2006 which became law in August 2008.<br /><br />Also note recent developments in, for example, the enforcement of contact orders resulting from the Children and Adoption Act 2006 and the revised sentencing guidelines introduced in 2009 for theft, burglary and breach of an ASBO emanating from the continuing work of the Sentencing Guidelines Council.<br /><br />The law is stated in the 2010 edition as at 1st October 2009. I often wondered who Ernest Anthony and John Dennis Berryman were when they began their long collaboration from the late 1960s, covering licensing, and the first edition of this complete I remember seeing was around 1971 when I started the LL.B and attended court for the first time- the title has just grown with the volume of offences over the years as the common law has been supplanted and consolidated by statute.<br /><br />But I'm glad the excellent and masterful F G Davies has kept the title as I still find the format of most assistance in that terribly short and pressured time when the justices are sitting, and I need the information instantly...and that's exactly what I'm getting again this year with the 2010 `Anthony & Berryman'.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-4057-4226-9ing from the continuing work of the Sentencing Guidelines Council.

0307269981|4.0|Much like its predecessor, [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]], The Girl Who Played With Fire is a thriller deeply concerned with the crimes of the past and how they affect both the present and the characters of the book. However, while Tattoo was a little more distant from its past, the past in Fire is far more active - and more dangerous. Just as Tattoo took an old mystery staple (the locked-room murder) and took it in entirely new and different directions, Fire takes on the old plot where a character is connected to a series of murders and must prove their innocence. However, in one of many great reversals, one of the brilliant touches Larsson throws in is a deep sense of uncertainty of just how innocent Salander is of the crimes - something that really isn't resolved one way or the other until very near the end of the book, a fact that creates a magnificent sense of unease that permeates the book. It's just one of many decisions that makes Fire such a gripping read. Larsson takes his time in establishing his characters and constructing a great world for them to inhabit, and by the time the plot starts rolling, all of what happens seems genuinely character-driven and logical, and we're genuinely tense about the outcomes of dangerous situations - and genuinely shocked at points where things go differently than we expect (particularly one jaw-dropper near the end). But of course, no book review would be complete without mentioning Lisbeth Salander, whose past becomes the key mystery of Fire. Salander is one of the more interesting and compelling characters in thrillers as of late, and Fire gives us (and Larsson) the chance to really delve into this character and find out what makes her tick, creating even more depth and intrigue in an already fascinating creation. It's really a shame that Larsson died, because the idea of a 10-12 book series about these characters really sounds great. Unfortunately, we're limited to three, but as long as they're this good, it's hard to complain too much.hey're this good, it's hard to complain too much.
0307408833|1.0|Although I am a fan of Babycakes desserts in New York City, this cookbook is inconsistent as the ingredients are not the same as the ones used in the bakery.  Furthermore, the recipes do not work.  Banana bread spilled all over my oven.  There is too much baking powder in many of the recipes, and it seems that the publisher did not proof each recipe for our kitchens.  I am a serious baker with many years of experience, but I've given up on this book.  It is a shame that the Babycakes' fans are so disappointed, but it is a disgrace that the publisher did not do a better job for their customers.  These recipes will not yield the desserts in the pretty pictures, nor the desserts that we've tasted at the bakery.
1592400876|5.0|This book has made me 100% self conscious of my writing and embarrassed about every mark I incorrectly make, don't make, or misplace. I highly recommend it albeit it will make you ashamed of every attempt you've made at writing and failed miserably at; I, personally, will be throwing in the towel on writing shortly after this review is completed.
B002UD56I6|3.0|I first saw \\"This Is It\\" in a wonderful venue with state-of-the-art sound and picture quality. I saw it multiple times during its original theatrical run. Being a lifelong Michael Jackson devotee who not only loves the man and his music, I too am a professional singer/musician and have always deeply recognized and appreciated his creativity, his genius, his deep social conscience, his humanitarianism, his shy, humble, loving personality that also contained elements of extreme intensity, focus, determination, and powerful drive; his remarkable musical talents and abilities, his incredible dancing, his brilliant songwriting, his excellent record production (even when he collaborated with others, especially Quincy Jones and Teddy Riley), in short, from the Jackson Five onward, this man was/is? a \\"Someone Like This Comes Around Once In Human History\\". Period.     However, when I learned Michael \\"clones\\" or if you like, \\"body doubles\\" were extensively used in the film I was incredulous. Just as a \\"double\\" was used to announce the ten that soon became fifty concerts, by the same name, \\"This Is It\\", at London's 02 arena. You may ask \\"How do we know that's true?\\" I ask you to do your homework, launch your own investigation, and you will learn the truth. Michael's very frail state of health during the three-month rehearsal span for the \\"concerts\\" prevented him from being fully-present at rehearsals. As a result, he missed many rehearsals at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. It has been said there are originally some 300+ hours of footage that director Kenny Ortega whittled down to roughly 112 minutes. Well, being a fellow musician/singer with a very keen ear, I actually heard pre-recorded vocal tracks Michael did AGES ago. These tracks were used in the film to give the impression \\"Michael\\" was actually singing. In reality, the tracks were used to boost the voice of the \\"Clone du Jour\\". I well-realize all feature films are \\"looped\\" in certain sequences. This is theprocess of re-recording the actors' dialogue and is typically done when the original sequence was filmed outdoors or where there was too much background noise. However, I'm not talking \\"looping\\" here. I'm talking deliberate deception. Giving the impression you were actually listening to Michael singing. I am convinced, in what if I recall correctly, was the well-publicized opening sequence that appeared in the trailers where \\"Michael\\" is wearing all-black with white embroidery (the same outfit \\"he\\" wore to make the 02 announcement), and you hear the voice-over \\"There he is. The Man is here\\", well, that was NOT \\"The Man\\". I firmly believe that was a \\"double\\" whose name I won't mention but you can easily find out. I am certainly not alone in this view. Joseph, as well as LaToya Jackson publicly stated \\"doubles\\" were used extensively in the film as well as pre-recorded vocals. There is an excellent Michael Jackson clone who lives in the UK and goes by the name of \\"Navi\\". He was contacted by the producers to appear in \\"longshots\\" and other sequences in this film. Navi declined to participate. If you research this you will find it to be fact.    Especially troubling was a sequence in which \\"Michael\\" was singing \\"Human Nature\\". His pitch was significantly \\"flat\\", which for him was a VERY rare event. Granted, if he couldn't hear himself well, if the volume in his headset wasn't sufficient, yes, his singing could easily be off-pitch. This is what I told myself when I watched and heard this sequence: \\"OK, he's flat only because his headset is too low\\". There were times I could tell he motioned for the headset to be amped up. However, \\"he\\" made the most curious body movements. Very unlike him, as anyone who has faithfully followed his career and performances would tell you. Michael Jackson's pitch was near-perfect...all his life. So much so it was uncanny. Even when he sang tight five-part harmony with his brothers. Even when he sang A Cappella. From his earliest solo vocalswith the Jackson Five, Michael's pitch was incredible. His tone and timbre was pure, clean, and gorgeous. May I remind you, these were the \\"pre-Pro Tools\\" days. These were the days when a singer had to actually SING. Possess REAL talent. Sure \\"reverb\\" and other vocal enhancements were used, however, in those days one's pitch couldn't be \\"corrected\\" by the flip of a switch or the touch of the Pro Tools key. I found this pitch issue very disturbing and very unlike Michael. One could argue, \\"Well, after all he's 50 years old now. Perhaps his voice isn't what it used to be\\". No. I don't accept that. One does not lose one's innate gifts, sense of pitch, vibrato, phrasing, etc., unless one has not cared for one's voice. Heavy drinking, smoking, and other irritants will certainly adversely effect the voice. However, Michael was neither a drinker nor smoker. Michael often studied with world-renowned vocal coach Seth Riggs. For those of you who are singers/entertainers, surely you're aware of this brilliant coach. Michael knew how to care for his instrument. He knew how to access certain notes beyond his \\"natural range\\". He mastered phrasing, breathing for \\"effect\\", and pitch. Most singers tend to lose pitch and go flat as they sing a descending scale. However, I've listened to tapes of Michael on the phone with Seth, \\"working out\\", if you will, and he virtually nails each note in both the chromatic and diatonic scales; whether he was ascending them or descending them. You must always keep in mind: Michael was an innovator. A perfectionist. He was rarely satisfied with the finished product; even when it was off-the-chart brilliant. He was a stickler for detail. In the song \\"Human Nature\\" he must sing a challenging interval (\\"Ah-haa-hawaaaaah\\") that's a bit of a \\"jazz lick\\". EVERY time I've heard him sing this passage, whether recorded or live, he consistently nails it. Without a \\"lead note\\" to give him his key/pitch. I know each and every musical nuance this man expressed inevery song he sang. To be fair, in the \\"Human Nature\\" sequence, once Mr. Ortega cued the band to follow Michael, his pitch did seem to improve as the song progressed. The reader must understand my intent here. I'm not saying Michael was not in the film entirely. What I am saying is, there were edits, \\"quick cuts\\", \\"longshots\\", \\"inserts\\", that featured body doubles and were not shots of Michael. FACT. Of course, In the film, the various \\"Michaels\\" said they weren't going to sing full-out as this was a rehearsal, which is common procedure. Even during a final dress rehearsal and sound-check (which we never saw in \\"This Is It\\" because that would have happened at the venue where the concert was to take place, namely, the 02 in London), it's not necessary to go into \\"performance-mode\\" completely. However, it is important to vocalize at the level in which you intend to perform in order for the sound-check to be accurate. Even if you only sing \\"scales\\".     I question the sequence in which \\"Michael\\" was wearing a gold jacket (if I recall correctly) and orange pants. If you unemotionally, closely scrutinize this sequence you'll find the body language and movements of this person weren't typical of those of Michael. They were far more static. Exaggerated. \\"Stiff\\". I'm now rather convinced in every sequence in which \\"Michael\\" was wearing shades, that was not him. Michael Jackson's eyes have ALWAYS expressed his spirit/soul. There is NO clone who could ever duplicate that. You could always see Michael's intensity, humanity, spirit, playfulness, brilliance, intelligence, and his very essence as a human being in his eyes. There was no need for shades. The stage was, for the most part, dimly lit. The \\"house lights\\" weren't on. Interestingly in the film, there are indeed sequences where Michael did NOT wear shades and in those sequences that may have been Michael. He was extremely thin, shockingly so. When you see a \\"healthy, robust Michael\\" you may rest assured that was not him.Why use body doubles? Why this deception? I have my own very well-grounded theories, however, this is not the forum in which to share them. But I do feel this film is a complete \\"fantasia\\". To call this a \\"documentary\\" is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of millions worldwide. If you watch this film realizing you're witnessing a \\"fantasia on the work of Michael Jackson, played out in part by clones\\", you may enjoy it. If you believe what you're watching is truth, I sadly say that simply is not the case, which actually broke my heart.    Finally: Michael Jackson did not want to do the 02 concerts. First off, he hated touring and has candidly said so several times. His exact words: \\"I hate to tour; I go through Hell touring\\". Fine. He did agree to the ten concerts and Tohme Tohme (I suggest you research him if you are unfamiliar with him) and AEG soon boosted the number to fifty concerts. Michael was in serious financial straits therefore he acquiesced to the original ten, which sadly was a more than ambitious thought on Michael's part. There is no possible way Michael could have performed fifty concerts, let alone ten, let alone two. This is FACT and if you research you will find several CREDIBLE media sources who shared this information with the world. He simply was not physically up to that. Yes, he had been physically training with Lou Ferrigno to get in shape for this extremely demanding tour; and in interviews with Mr. Ferrigno, you will hear beaming reports of how fit Michael was. How excited he was about this venture. This is the same rhetoric that was also said by Mr. Ortega in pre-release interviews and trailers. However, one thing Mr. Ortega said hit me like a ton of bricks: (Paraphrasing) \\"We had to remind Michael to stay hydrated\\". This was said after Mr. Ortega had been asked about Michael's state of mind and physical health, and he insisted Michael was raring-to-go, high-spirited, ebullient, and the perfect picture of health. Yet Michaelneeded \\"reminding\\" to stay hydrated? Think about that. One could argue Michael was so excited and \\"into\\" the work that he forgot to drink and eat? I think not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Michael had toured worldwide countless times and yes, he has said in the past he sometimes goes into serious work-mode and is so driven that he's locked in tunnel-vision. However this time, Michael's behavior was erratic regarding his dedication to the project. Missed rehearsals. He simply wanted to get \\"this\\" over with. Always the consummate professional, Michael certainly would have given this his very soul, as he always did. He NEVER did anything in half-measures. However, his state of mind and physical condition precluded his professional/personal dedication. The hype simply was and is NOT truth. Learn the backstory.    Even the title song chosen for the film, \\"This Is It\\" is an OLD song Michael wrote in collaboration with Paul Anka. I believe it was written circa 1991'ish. It was a demo that had never been \\"sweetened\\" until this film was in production. The surviving members of the Jackson Five sang the background vocals once sweetened. In my opinion, this song is certainly not one of Michael's best, not even close. The sweetened, final product (which Michael had NO part in the production thereof) is redundant, it lacks energy, feeling (not on the part of Michael's vocals, it's due to the constraints of the structure of the song, the key it's in which I feel was not the greatest key for Michael's voice/range, it's sterile and predictable in production, I certainly don't care for the horn arrangements nor the keyboard arrangement. The chorus does have redeeming value, the arrangement for background vocals/harmony is pleasing to the ear and does support/compliment the strings, lead vocal, and remaining instruments quite well; and the chorus, which also becomes the vamp/hook until the \\"fade\\", is my favorite section of the song). In short, had Michael been able to choose a title song for this film, I feel it most certainly would NOT have been \\"This Is It\\". I would think he would have composed a new song entirely, however, when he left Sony Music in 2002 under VERY difficult terms (putting it mildly) and became a free agent, he contractually owed them one box set and any two songs of his choosing. Hence \\"This Is It\\".    I gave this film three stars for the editing; for the cinematography (which also frankly disturbed me...why was  \\"rehearsal footage\\" filmed in such high quality?...as if it was INTENDED to be a feature film); for the few times I saw Michael in the film...I think...and for the glorious opportunity to revisit Michael's incredible voice,  music, and spirit, albeit via pre-recorded tracks of songs I already own.     I ask Sony Pictures, AEG, Kenny Ortega, and others who shall remain unmentioned, one simple and unfortunately rhetorical question to which I believe I already know the answer:    Why?    In light of obvious \\"legalities\\" I will state that what I've said is my personal opinion.
B002BFIN6K|4.0|This is a very well done recording. Too often, CD sound is overly compressed but the dynamic range of this is wonderful. I tend to increase the volume when playing this CD since the overall average volume is lower - this really enhances the enjoyment and emotional power of the music.     I know people may have trouble with the Zenph concept, but I find the concept intriguing and the execution on this CD is very well done. Until there is time travel, this is a real treat.     Be aware that there are 13 tracks on this CD: 1 - 13 are recorded in standard stereo and then repeated as 14 - 26 in binaural stereo for headphones. I would rather have thius split into 2 separate discs but that is a nit.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this first season. I do have one reservation. The thing is, I believe this is not for young children. The animated violence is a bit much for them to handle, but other than that, I can only hope that Season 2 comes out in a quicker timeframe!<br />Simply fantastic!!!!
0061020710|5.0|the first of a series of books and i would recommend reading this one first and get to know the magical world discworld
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie was very boaring!!! nothing happened in the first hr .. it sucked Balls...totally THE NAME STEVEN BAKER  IS CHESSEY!!!LOL
B002Q9MZHE|3.0|First, I'd like to say that overall I enjoyed this film.  Widescreen, superb picture and sound, gorgeous principals with 2 of the top voices of our era, delivers much of what I'd hoped from this new, enhanced, blue-ray version.  Using the movie medium to show outdoor scenes of Paris, quick cuts to show happenings in different places at the same time added dimension and realism.  But, for every felicity added, the film managed to subtract something equally important.      For instance, when the men are horsing around upstairs, Mimi is shown hearing the raucus downstairs in her apartment, then purposely bringing a candle up the stairs and blowing it out to join the party.  A nice bit of motivation.  But then when she and Rudolfo leave his apartment to join the others at Momus, she leads him by the hand into her apartment, where they are shown undressed, making passionate love.  It is very physical and rapidly advances their relationship, but a bit of a shock to how they are able to fit this in, yet still make it to the festivities in time for dinner.  Arguably, an acceptable, although awkward, trade-off.  But, being a film, there are constantly issues that take away from our sense of involvement.    In many cases, the singers voices are slightly out-of-synch.  Similarly, there is cut after cut where the action doesn't quite match with the previous scene.  In some cases, there are excesses where one scene superimposes on another to give some sort of filmic, dreamy effect that takes away, rather than enhances our involvement.  There are also scenes, typical of many filmed versions of operas, where the singers are heard singing, but where on camera, they are just making love.  Adds to the sensual, physicality, but reminds us that we are not seeing this live, but watching a highly manipulative film.  The ultimate travesty, in my view, was the final scene of the film, where the producers used what I'm sure they thought was an artistic, symbolic device to give meaning to the film, but which I thought totally destroyed the impact.  See for yourself, your reactions may vary!
0374531269|5.0|First off, this is fact, not fiction. This book follows Ishmael Beah's journey through war torn Sierra Leone after his village is attacked by the RUF (Rebels). It follows him through his horrible journey of becoming a child soldier fighting against the RUF. The RUF is mainly after diamonds, specifically the money after selling the diamonds. Ishmael is forced to flee, fight, and witness horrific tragedies that no human should witness, let alone a child. This book just opens so many questions for policy-makers and the individual to answer. Why buy rocks to sit on your nasty finger if it costs people their lives? How are you going to help stop this and prevent it from occurring again? So far, not much has been done about child soldiers throughout the world, with many now in Sudan and spread across many parts of Africa, as well as South America. This is a worldwide problem that Ishmael Beah has thankfully shed light upon. Now, what are you willing to do to stop this?
0349106533|5.0|one of the 5 best books i've read. nelson mandela may be the most courageous leader of my lifetime. like MLK, he showed great courage and inspired millions. like ghandi, he changed his country and the course of history. i thought i knew the story of aparthied but i knew very little. pls read this book.
B00320HN00|5.0|Loved the book, of course!! My fiance gave it to me for Christmas, I was so happy. I was even more excited when I noticed there was a dvd included in the back of the book. IT IS AWESOME!!! I had never heard of Blue October, so I'd certainly never heard of Justin Furstenfeld, writer/singer/musician. Anyway, he is incredible! Stephanie is great also, she is on the dvd talking with Justin. This is a must have for anyone who loves The Twilight Saga and can relate emotionally to music.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the best mini-series ever.  Each episode is its own unique and compelling story.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm not a die-hard Trekkie, but I've seen all the films. Pound for pound, this is the best. Just watch it.
B000FC2JTS|5.0|This book is a must read for every woman. Particularly women who feel that they are not been treated the way they should be treated by the man in their life. I enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a lot of insite into men and their actions. I read this book as a way of getting over a failed relationship. Reading the letters from women in the book showed me how I was accepting less (much less actually) than I deserved just to have someone in my life. I now realize that if someone really cares about me, he wouldn't treat me like crap and that I can do much better and deserve much better.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|It's a Tarantino movie, it's revisionist history....get over it.  It has some of the best acting performances of the year (Christoph Waltz). If you're one of those people that doesn't like reading sub-titles and can only tolerate English go watch Delta Farce or something.
0199233381|3.0|Paul Cartledge's engaging history of Ancient Greece fills the niche of a quick guide to the places, names and events that a reader may want learn about in order to get oriented to a vast and much covered topic. He does this in a readable fashion with maps and a handful of well-chosen plates. He admirably uses the latest in archeological scholarship to fill out his work, which nonetheless remains intentionally cursory.    As noted in the Product Description, his framework is 11 cities that he describes in the chronological order that they were important to the evolving history of the Ancient Greek world, enabling him to cover such topics as Ancient Mycenaean Greece, the colonization movements both east and west of mainland Greece, the conquests of Alexander and the Hellenistic world, and the rise and fall of the Byzantine civilization.    The chief criticism is inherent in the project itself. Names, places speed by so quickly that one is left knowing that one has passed through the countryside but is unable to say much about it. Having read other histories, I was aware of the vast amounts of material that needed to be edited out. And in fairness Cartledge devotes many pages at the end for an annotated section of suggestions for further reading.    But if you are in the market for a Cook's Tour of the Ancient World, this Baedeker will probably fit the bill until you have the leisure to come visit at greater length.
B002RVZV9U|3.0|I was dying to see this, especially after reading a number of reviews here.  I heard so much about the scenes with the three of them together discussing and playing, but it turns out those scenes are maybe 10% of the movie, and the best ones are in the deleted scenes reel.  The rest is a poorly edited (scatter-shot, if you will) set of scenes where each musician talks about where they came from (e.g. Edge visits the school where U2 formed, or stock footage of Detroit with Jack White talking over the top).  The idea of hearing how these guys developed seems like it would be cool, but there's very little real information in these scenes.  If they release another disc of the three of them together just talking and jamming in the same room for 100% of the movie, I would buy that in a heartbeat.  It's worth watching once, it does have its moments, but not very many...
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I don't understand the people that thought this movie was great. Everything about it was low budget - except the marketing.<br /><br />Low budget doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a bad movie, but in this case it does. This is just another Blair Witch look a like. It has the same single hand held camera look and feel. Apparently, we are supposed to wonder \\"is this real\\". It's not, and it doesn't look it.<br /><br />There are no special effects, but far worse, there is not much of a script. Yet again, movie moguls have figured out a way to rip us off. They hyped this crap and laughed all the way to bank.<br /><br />Save your money, and save your time. Honestly, if I could rate this movie below one star, I would.
B002T45VX6|2.0|Disappointed. Have to say it. Have loved listening to her for many years now,I found this to be a \\"sell out\\" album. Trying new things is great, all artists should but this seems to be a Lady Gaga type of rehash.  To many noises, not enough Shakira.   Some of the tracks are really good and easy to dance to (especially belly dance). But the Eastern feel of her music is really gone here.   So much repitition of lyrics bothered me.   I enjoy her intelligent lyrics, she has never dumbed them down before but now she seems to be pulling a \\"Pop Princess\\" move and going for a lot of groin references.   Way over-produced, just feels like she is visiting the CD instead of being the lead artist.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice!  I enjoyed the CD and bought several of them for presents.  I would rather all of her numbers had been solos; the back-up musicians sound like \\"country altos\\" to me.    I hope she does well and produces more albums soon.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|An incredible musician and an incredible band.  A combination of artists not to be missed.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've seen Joe live twelve times since 2001 and I own everything he has recorded from Bloodlines to present. As a 58 YO long time blues fan, I have seen most of the great old-school blues guys and new blues bands. Joe has earned his reputation by hard work and playing small clubs and earning fans-one show at a time. Trust me when I tell you he will be mentioned with Jimi, Eric, Stevie Ray as one of the greatest guitarists of all time. BB King, who Joe has played with since he was 12 YO, AGREES!!!
0307454541|5.0|i love this series, i hope to pieces, that we can exprese everything that lisbeth needs to make it to the third books.
B002NXPTDK|4.0|I bought this CD kind of on a whim. And ... it's not really a rap CD. Whenever Kid Cudi tries to write a rap song, he fails horribly. You can tell this the most in Mr. Solo Dolo, which is just a horrible, horrible song. Run away from it. I basically dropped a star off just because the song is on the CD. A lot of the CD is really danceable, and kind of half-sung. Enter Galactic, Alive, Up Up + Away, Make Her Say, Day N' Nite, Sky Might Fall[this one gets old quickly, though] are all good songs, and a couple of the others are good [Cudi Zone, Pursuit of Happiness ... etc.]. When he raps, it's just ... he's not as good at rapping as other rappers. But ... uhh ... the beats are almost all really good. I've been listening to it for the last week or two, pretty much exclusively, and I haven't felt the urge to switch CD's yet.  I've been describing him as a kind of odd cross between Daft Punk and ... I don't know, Nas or something. It's a good CD.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Love the books and the movies, including this one. A little more mature (teen) than the others. It is impossible to get every detail from a 650 page book into a movie. As with all book to movie translations things are bent to fit into a live action setting. I would agree that this movie would be a little confusing if you didn't know the Harry Potter story line. Is there such a person?
B002GJU54E|3.0|I am a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series.  They are funny and entertaining and I love the characters.  This book was good but not great.  The story line was exceptionally dumb and the usual characters didn't have a big role.  Diesel is okay but needed more of the family, Ranger and Morelli.  The plot with the monkeys and the scientific experiments was not the best but Stephanie Plum still made you laugh.
B00008972S|5.0|Fantastic movie!  A remake of Romeo and Juliet set on the streets of 1950s New York.  White impoverished kids whose families are from Poland, etc. battle gangs of Puerto Ricans in the streets.  A Puerto Rican girl and Polish-American boy fall in love.  Uh-oh!  Lots of fighting and death.  The odd point is that the story contains dancing, singing and a lot of energy.  That is what makes it a great movie.  Really affecting and very moving.  A must see, over and over again.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Bought for 6 yr old Beatle fan.  Was suprised by all the things in it---cd,dvd,booklet,baseball card.  He loves it!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I do not have HBO, so I ordered this on the recommendations of others that the show was great. Since I am into other vampire stuff, I figured I would like it. When I first got the DVD, I didn't realize how much sex was involved. I'm used to Twilight and Vampire Diaries series where there is none of that or very little. Not that it's a bad thing, just watched alone, cause I had to wait til the kids were asleep! I am from Louisiana, and probably the only thing that really bothered me about the show was the horrible mangling of our accents and the way we talk, but then I decided to put that out of my head and be an objective viewer. The worst accent of all came from Renee(understandably, considering he is faking a fake accent-haha), but I am so glad they killed his ass because I don't think I could have made it through season two with his dumbass around! All the characters are very colorful and memorable, and I am absolutely in love with Sam! I do not see WHY ON EARTH Sookie would pick Bill over Sam, but shes not the sharpest tool in the shed I guess. They always pick the cold, dead vamps over the shape-shifters! ANYWAY, if you just want to escape real life for a while and watch something that is totally entertaining, then this series is for you. I have never read the book series, but I will before I order the season 2 dvds, because I would like to be able to compare the two. ENJOY! TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!
B001OQCV60|4.0|When I heard that Robert Downey Jr was going to play Sherlock Holmes, I had my doubts. Robert Downey Jr is an immensely talented actor, but could he play such a well established character as Sherlock Holmes ? If you're looking for a movie novelization of Conan Doyle's books, watch the Jeremy Brett episodes instead.     Guy Ritchie has definitely updated this version of Holmes to be a more modern man of action, but he still adheres to the original characterization. Holmes is described as being a talented boxer and fencer as well as having great strength. So, it's no surprize to see him engaging in fisticuffs. He's also described as being rude, insolent and at times morose. Whether or not he'd work hand in hand with Irene Adler is another issue. There are many parts of of this movie that seem very true to the books and others which are a modern update. I'd say that Guy Ritchie definitely took some poetic license with this movie. But, this does not detract from the story. This is a very entertaining movie.     Oddly enough, Robert Downey Jr was a surprizingly good (cerebral) choice to play Holmes. It certainly required out of box thinking to cast him. No, he doesn't look like the drawings from the Strand. He shouldn't. Once again, you can't compare him to any other portrayal of Holmes. This is a modern way to look at Holmes. In this version, he uses his brawn as much as his brain. As a personal note, find out who Robert Downey Jr's personal trainer is because RDJ is in amazing physical condition. While you can argue that Sherlock Holmes might not have fought in a pit, he would have felt uneasy in a social situation. In one scene where he's dinning with Watson and his fiancee, Mary, you see how uncomfortable he is in public places. You see how outside noises seem to disturb his neural processes. He can't block out the noise, he can't think clearly and it puts him on edge. RDJ is wonderful at displaying Holmes' brilliant mind and occasionally off putting eccentricities.Speaking of those eccentricities, the moments with the violin were a nice touch.     Now, also of considerable note was Jude Law. His Watson was absolutely spot on. He was wonderful. Nigel Bruce, God bless him, was nothing like the books. In fact, Jude Law's Watson is much closer to the book and that was a pleasant surprize. Watson was never supposed to be a bumbling old fool. Watson was supposed to be a competent retired military doctor. So, it makes sense that Holmes would have someone like Jude Law's Watson by his side. And Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have absolutely fabulous chemistry. You have to pay attention because their witty repartee is very rapid fire and very funny. When you see them arguing, it really does look like you're watching an old married couple. There is a off hand reference to them being brothers, not of blood, but of the soul. That's very true in this case. Holmes and Watson are portrayed as squabbling siblings. Can't live with each other and can't live with out.     Rachel McAdams does make a fetching Irene Adler, but her character does seem out of place in this story. I feel she was put in so that the film didn't seem like an old boys type of film. It is a very male dominated film and the Irene Adler character is supposed to add a bit of femininity. Here's my problem with her character. She's described as a master criminal in the movie. That was never the Irene Adler in the books. Yes, she bested Holmes and yes, she masqueraded in male costume and maybe Holmes was in love with her. But, in the movie, she's portrayed as a female Sherlock Holmes and that didn't sit right with me. Once again, this is a modern update of the Holmes story. The villain, Lord Blackwood, is portrayed by Mark Strong and he is very good. He has a very mellifluous voice that he uses to his advantage as Blackwood. I can't say if the black leather jacket was period to the 1880s, but it did lend a sense of malevolence to his character.     I will say that I appreciatedthat the art director showed London as it was in the 1890s i.e. dirty, grimy and crime infested. People should remember that the London atmosphere that produced Holmes, also produced Jack the Ripper. Of course, in some ways, you could compare Lord Blackwood to Jack the Ripper, but it isn't so neat. This is where the story does get a bit confusing and convoluted. Part of the story involves black magic and a secret society that may or may not be the Masons. The story doesn't always make sense and that's where the action compensates. I do think that Guy Ritchie did go a bit overboard with the action. He should have concentrated more on the story. In short, what the story lacked in coherency, it made up with great actions scenes and witty repartee between Holmes and Watson.     I enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed this film in spite of the weakness in the story. It's a surprizingly good take on the Holmes mythos.
1419375628|5.0|This book is so real that it is scary.  You can tell that Scott Adams has spent time. His description of cube life is still relevant today.<br /><br />I have been trying to justify the Peter Principle and could not make it fit but after reading this book all things became clear. It is impossible to keep a straight face in meetings with out seeing the different types of personalities doing their thing. I can even anticipate what they are going to say and the reactions.<br /><br />Usually as most books and movies you recognize everyone but yourself. The most obnoxious person will laugh at his stereotype or just not get the point when it comes to movies and books.  However this book is scary in the fact that I could see myself when Scott was describing engineers. And it took a little while to realize what he was talking about the ringing device that knows when to break your concentration.<br /><br />I am going to leave a copy on QA's desk.<br /><br />MY next must read is \\"Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook\\"
B0026RHR6K|5.0|The five stars are for the series. If I was grading the complete package it would be one star. Sliding DVD's in and out of cardboard sleeves has never been a very good packing idea. Amazon just lowered the price on this package, but if you want to buy the entire series look at picking up the individual seasons which are now at rock bottom prices on Amazon, which is currently about 33% less than the complete box set and will end up probably lasting longer.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I watched this dvd just this AM and what I saw was three important things  to me that defined the movie.<br /><br /> 1.Jack White IS talented and ,should be given more credit than he has gotten over the last few years.<br />2.The Edge is better at his craft then what I assumed.Not being a big U2 fan I was ready to blow him off as a guitar player.Not bad,not great but,not bad.<br />3.Jimmy Page is the man always has been ....always will be.<br /><br />In watching the 3 converse on the sound stage in Cailf.was interesting to say the least.Jack seemed more at ease than Edge.Jimmy came off as relaxed and interesting.I found Jack W.kinda odd but,talented.Edge seemed oddly out of place.I don't know if he really belonged there.He seemed a little nervous in front of Jimmy.In fact I kept noticing that The Edge would rarely speak directly to Jimmy only to Jack.?<br /><br />The footage of Jimmy as a hip young gunslinger in the session days of London was treat to see, brief though it may have been.see.It seemed as if all The Edge wanted to talk about was how bad it was in Ireland when he lived there. Jack'geniune awe and love of Son House was moving. He spoke of him in a reverence almost.Nice.<br /><br /> Jimmy putting on an old 45 and step by step going thru the air guitar motions was like that Visa card commerical....\\"priceless\\".His face just lite up.<br /> Oh yea when Jimmy starts playin' Whole lotta' love\\" and the 2 just looking on in awe as if to say ...\\"holy S@%& this is Jimmy Page playing for us.\\"<br /> My favorite part however for me was the footage of Zeppelin at Headley Grange and,that Jimmy went back and walked amoung the ghosts of the past as it were.<br /><br /> I think another reviewer put it best when they said Jack W. and The Edge were outgunned.Not having talent, charisma, intellect, respect or money to come close to Jimmy Page.<br /> I really enjoyed the film I belive the lack of sparks between the 3 was evident.If you are fan of any of these guitar players you owe to yourself to watch.<br /><br />Lastly if Jimmy Page questions wheather you are playing in the right key...you might want to admint to being in the wrong Key.ns wheather you are playing in the right key...you might want to admint to being in the wrong Key.
B000001E7T|1.0|My girlfriend found this cd at a resale shop and we put it in and groaned at the long intros, and the flailing voice of a self proclaimed misuderstood artist. Not even 2,000 years from now will she be famous. No real artistic talent other than being weird, and usually weird is good, but in her case it wa Yoko Ono weird, and that's not good, not good at all.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Lyrical content has never been a big consideration with me.  While I appreciate the intelligent lyric as much as anyone, the music is what I pay attention to.  Maybe that's how most musicians are - I've noticed non-musician fans tend to pay much more attention to the lyrical content.  Whatever floats your boat, or in this case, a longboat.<br />  Not being a student of Norse historical mythology, the tales of warriors and bravado earn at most a big shrug with me and the subject matter not changing album after album for Amon Amarth could get monotonous, but with the music this catchy, who cares?<br />  \\"Twilight Of The Thunder God\\" is the best AA CD I own, with more musical muscle than ever before without sacrificing the signature guitar attack that could have easily had ol' King Olaf headbanging with the best of 'em had this type of metal existed back in the good old days.  The title track has lead guitar, as do a few others, and that's a plus because the tunes really did need some icing here and there.  The use of real minor chord structures adds depth to the rhythm playing and helps accent the lead work, which is pretty damn good.  More, please.<br />  Of course, much is made of the appearance of Apocalyptica, but the CD's main strength is the pounding beat, lyrics you can decipher and good melody work.  Amon Amarth have grown, and one hopes they continue to expand their sound, with more lead guitar work, and maybe some clean vocal lines here and there just to spice it up.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|I am so happy to see a different accounting and kill scores, than most all of the other films using WW2 as the basis of their films.<br /><br />Yes, it's a trip into Fantasyland, but such a welcomed change of pace.  I am sooooooo tired of watching Jews being ripped out of their homes and away from their families that I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Nazi Bastards being the victims of aggressive, tough-as-nails Jewish Commando \\"Basterds\\" (Yeah Team!!!).  I was so excited by the action that I fell out of my power wheelchair, all the while cheering them on.<br /><br />There are many reviews of this film shown here that give lots of storyline details.  This is not one of them.  The emotional impact this film has had on me has been spiritual.<br /><br />I think that Mr. Tarantino has truely created another Masterpiece in film-making.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|I knew this was about a young girl who had been brutally murdered.  What I didn't realize was that the brutality of the murder is repeated and explored and repeated.  I can handle the psychology of the killer, the pain of the parents, I just don't need the graphic images repeated again and again in my mind.  I read the whole book waiting for it to get better.  The book kept my interest but focusing on that much violence was polluting for me.  I don't need to add that to my life. I can just watch the news if I want gore.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|Where to begin. Now that I think about it, the reason I'm writing this is to vent. First, I'll address the pros, then I'll lament the plethora of cons.    Pros:    Interesting Premise. I've always been at least somewhat interested in most vampire stories, and I like the setting and idea for this one.    Engaging. It does keep you wanting to see what happens next. More on this later.    Comedy. There is the rare actually funny part, and then there is another much more common laugh because if you don't find some way to let out the frustration you'll go crazy. I'm actually being quite generous to put this under Pros.      Cons:    Acting. Usually I'm impressed with the acting in HBO series, however this one is an exception. I'm not sure how half of these actors were cast. I would think that there would have to be better actors among the thousands of people attempting to get acting jobs in L.A.    Accents. I suppose this could be classified under acting, but the accents used by some of the actors are so incredibly bad as to warrant a mention in itself. The accent of Rutina Wesley (Tara Thornton) was particularly awful, and I found myself actually cringing many times when she and other actors spoke. I'm from the South, so maybe I just notice this more but this doesn't excuse them.    Character Development. The entire series I felt like all of the characters were highly volatile to the point where they are completely unbelievable (and yes, I realize this is a show about vampires). Anna Paquin's character Sookie- a ridiculous name in itself, especially for the lead, which annoyed the bejesus out of me every time I heard it (but I digress)- could be called anything but stable and rational. Yes, we can be inherently irrational creatures, but her character was laughable. She would completely flip-flop on issues and completely change her mind, or blow up emotionally for no apparent reason given by the show. How can you follow the characters or empathize with them if you can'tunderstand where they are coming from?    Engaging/Plot Development. Yes, the story is engaging. And I like plot twists. But the massive number of plot twists take away any value or surprise that plot twists normally give and left me wondering when an alien starship was going to come in and declare war specifically on \\"Sookie,\\" or (insert random idea here). Also you can count on a plot twist or hanger at the end of each episode which kept me intrigued enough to watch the next episode but drove me into a pit of self-loathing because I've never wanted to stop watching a series so badly in my entire life. After the ridiculously huge hanger in the final episode, I was more than able to swear off this series for good. My only hope and wish is that this series tanks like the Titanic and that I could be standing on a nearby iceberg waving and saying \\"Good Riddance.\\"
0545123267|1.0|This book isn't horribly written, it really isn't.  The fact that I bought it when warewolves don't do much for me is a testiment to the intriguing first chapter, which I read in the bookstore (and which was only a page and a half long, like most of the following chapters).  Some of the prose is downright poetic--and that's about the extent of the positive for Shiver.      In fact,the prose itself became a problem for me about a quarter of the way through when I realized that this novel wasn't deep enough to support it's language. Even when Sam, who's supposed to be sensitive and lyrical, is telling the story--and he does every other chapter--the purple prose stands out like it was typed in bold font.  It just doesn't mesh well in an otherwise shallow and predictable setting.      The plot has potential but is seriously lacking in anything resembling suspense--which is kind of key in a supernatural love story.  The book rapidly moves from one inplausible event to the next with no real sense of lose or gain, no hold-your-breath moments.  Even if such wern't the case, I find it hard to believe I would care what happened to the characters either way since co-protagonists Grace and Sam have all the dimension of paper dolls.  I just can't empathize with Grace when she fights with a friend of feels the (inexplicable) absense of her parents or obsesses over her wolfboy because she never evolves beyond the fictional and cliche.  And as for Sam, well, Sam WANTS to be chivalrous and brave and romantic and a whole long list of other admirable things, but only comes off as a wince-worthy Gary Stu.      Aside from all this, the unbelievable in the plot is too often given a paper-thin explination or no explination at all, and left me feeling cheated and a little insulted.  Overall, Shiver was for me a case of skin without bones; it had the looks of an entertaining fantasy, but lacked the inner strength to pull it off.
1594488843|5.0|Like all great business books, this one takes a universal truth and makes you slap your head in recognition.<br /><br />Just look at all these reviews... no one got paid to write them, but they're thoughtful and useful (most of them, anyway).<br /><br />It won't take you long to get through the first third, but it might just change you.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I found this movie to be absolutely visually stunning. It too, was magical. I loved it as an adult, and I can only imagine how much more fun it would be to watch it as a child. I won't say much about the story because you either probably already know or don't want to know. I knew nothing about the story going in, and I loved being surprised. It's a wonderful film for all ages, and the visual imagery was breathtaking.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the sequel (and second in a trilogy) to The Hunger Games, which I liked, but I didn't love. After reading Catching Fire, I like The Hunger Games more. I won't spoil The Hunger Games for you if you haven't read it (and if you haven't, you really should.) The things that bothered me in the first book (the half-hearted romance and the lack of depth and a greater message) were my favorite parts of book two. The romance was beautifully written and perfectly placed within the drama instead of as an aside. There is depth and a greater message. If book three continues these trends, it will be an amazing, fully realized trilogy of dystopian literature. Knowing the depth of Catching Fire makes me appreciate what I took as the simplicity of The Hunger Games as the subtleness and groundwork for the trilogy. The restraint Suzanne Collins showed is amazing. The Hunger Games felt like young adult literature, but Catching Fire didn't. Yes, our narrator and heroine is seventeen, but this book should be read by adults too.<br /><br />It seems fans of this trilogy (book 3 will be out August 24, 2010 - just in time for my birthday!) fall into two camps: those who like The Hunger Games better and those who like Catching Fire better. I am clearly in the second camp. I cannot wait for the third book.
0307716988|5.0|Although this was written when he was younger, it was a good read.  It gave me insight into the way he saw his life. He gave up so much for his music. We lost an incredible person. May he rest in peace.
B002VECM40|5.0|The movie Precious is based on Sapphire's only novel to date, Push.<br /><br />Precious is certainly bleak, but it's empowering and uplifting in a real way rather than a feel-good based-on-a-true-story kind of way. As the sad, dark revelations about her life unfold, the movie shifts inside her imagination to brief shots of Precious in her dreams. I loved this storytelling device; when the story got dark, there was something hopeful. The audience shared with Precious's coping mechanisms.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the film as whole, even though it's not necessarily a film I want to rewatch. Gabby Sidibe was fantastic. Mo 'Nique has gotten a lot of positive reviews, but I found her performance adequate,  not amazing. Paula Patton, however, absolutely stole the film for me. She was mesmerizing, subtle and powerful. I would love to see her nominated for Best Supporting Actress.
0061148512|5.0|I think more than anything else, The Bell Jar is a book about uncertainty and failure.  Like the main character, when I first entered college, I thought that anyone who encounters these two horrific obstacles is stuck forever in a trap, and nothing short of a flawless record is ever worthy of existence.  I didn't realize that if you live long enough, you're certain to encounter such setbacks, and if you live even longer, you're certain to get through them as well.<br /><br />The actual book title is a bit puzzling initially, but it ties in really well with the story and this theme about life being full of times when you're imprisoned in an incredible streak of depressing, non-successful ventures.  Even something as simple as sleep becomes a struggle to accomplish.  It's like the hand of God has abandoned you, and you just have to wait for it to come back.<br /><br />The modernized world has great expectations of us all, and we have great expectations of the modernized world.  But sooner or later, both parties will fall short of these expectations.  We expect to have no problems getting through school, succeeding in a career, finding love, and starting a family.  We don't expect setbacks and failures such as divorce, suicide, inadequate talent, infidelity, car accidents, miscarriages, and bad economic times to play enough of a factor to damage our plans.  And the world doesn't expect us to fall into these things.  But in truth, none of us is above a single one of these failures falling upon us.<br /><br />ABC's \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\" sums up a good portion of The Bell Jar for me in the statement, \\"I've seen the future.  I can't afford it.\\"  It's a statement I agree with.  Despite our expectations, we can't afford the future.  But somehow, miraculously, with a lot of hope and a lot of help, there just may be a way to get through it.  So believe it or not, The Bell Jar leaves me with a strong feeling of optimism, at this, the closing of the year.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|The Proposal is an average romantic comedy. Perhaps there is more comedy than romance, but none of the comedy is particularly original or smart. No new ground is broken. If you like romantic comedies, you will probably like it; if you don't, you probably won't. The movie could serve as a commercial for Alaskan tourism (or wherever they actually filmed the Alaska scenes.) The geography was breathtaking, and there were a lot of talented actors with very little to do.

0545123267|2.0|Shiver is a werewolf love story. It's told through the points of view of Grace, who was bitten by the pack of wolves who live in the woods behind her house in Mercy Falls, Minnesota, and Sam, who was also bitten by these wolves and became one of them. No one in town knows the wolves are werewolves that change for the season. In the summer, Sam is a boy! In the winter, he's a wolf. No one in town notices that some people are only around in the summer. Yes, this is a plot hole, but the author attempts to explain this phenomenon through the fact, one year, the wolf will not change back and will be a wolf year round (until they die, and wolves apparently only live about fifteen years). Yes, this situation is rife for teen angst.<br /><br />Grace and Sam are in love, and perhaps my biggest problem with this book was the lack of development of their love. Sure, one could argue they had a powerful connection and attraction, but I still think it was underdeveloped. Mostly, I didn't like this book because I didn't like Stiefvater's writing. I average one eye-roll per page. Without an adequate foundation for the romance, it all seemed trite, silly and elementary. Yes, it's young adult fiction, but young adult fiction is often adult fiction with teenage narrators. This book is not. I wanted to stop reading this book, and if it weren't for many trusted opinions raving, I would have. While my opinion is not the minority, it's certainly not the majority.
B001PO53IO|4.0|I enjoyed this series but I find the packaging pretty flawed, in our local Australian version we have the art booklet seperate & a bluray case inside of a slipcase & details about the show printed on the back of the slipcase, easy to preserve everything. Whereas with the american version the artbook is integrated inside with the blurays and there's a cardboard slip (which shows what the shows about, what the special features are, etc) glued very lightly on the back since its supposed to look like a book I guess. This sheet of cardboard on the back also has an annoying thing that bends over the packaging to the front and the only way this makes any sense is for the buyer looking at it in shrinkwrap form, once its open its like they want you to throw out the cardboard even though it contains what I think is the most important information. And once its out of shrinkwrap there's no way to close it back up since its made in a book design, chuck it in an ordinary bag and it'll easily open itself, potentially damaging your discs & bending all the pages of the intergrated artbook    Honestly to fix everything all it needed was a slipcase & a seperate artbook if we want to give it to the kids or something. At least Australia knows what its doing whereas America always seems to get the worst packaging (like Futurama Bender's Big Score that wasn't even in a proper dvd case, just some flimsy cardboard that got broken within days). The only reason I imported this was because it was $40 cheaper & I didn't know
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline was nominated for best animated movie (Golden Globes). I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, but I was excited to see the film. Visually, it's absolutely majestic. The storyline is not quite as exciting as the art on screen, but it is a movie meant for children. Overall, I enjoyed it. The storyline dragged a few times for me, but honestly, I could have watched it on mute and enjoyed the movie. Without 3D glasses, I can't comment on that side of the disc, but the \\"regular\\" version was breathtaking.
B000G8NXYQ|4.0|Amarcord is an imaginary word invented by Fellini that most closely resembles in the Emiliano-Romagnolo dialect \\"mi recordo\\" (I remember). The film is a recreation of Fellini's childhood in Rimini, where he grew up. The movie is not meant to be autobiographical, but is more of an imaginary recollection of life growing up in a small coastal town in Italy in the 1930s during the rise of fascism. Fellini's depicts a dream like, magical world of youth that presents its mysteries and adventures. Fellini never filmed this movie in Rimini for fear that the reality of the location would diminish his memories of the excitement of growing up there. A studio was located in the area of Rome where the movie was filmed. Even the scene of the boats sitting in the night waters as the passenger ship the \\"Rex\\" goes by is situated inside a studio. The illusion of water was recreated with plastic sheets rustling. This scene was a fabrication of Fellini's imagination as the \\"Rex\\" never past by Rimini. Fellini was actually worried that the scene might look too realistic. It was said that Fellini was not happy when the town's folk of Rimini said they recognized themselves in the movie since this was not Fellini's intention. Most of the people are characters from Fellini's imagination. The movie itself takes place over a period of a year, and has neither plot nor defined characters. The movie is like a series of vignettes strung together like visual poems evoking a time from Fellini's past. The films of Fellini leading up to La Dolca Vita (1960) tended to a narrative realism, whereas those that followed, including \\"Amarcord\\" (1973), were more dreamlike, episodic, and artificial.<br /><br />The Criterion edition is a restored high definition transfer that includes a deleted scene with an optional English dubbed soundtrack in 5.1 stereo, or the original Italian in 1.0 digital mono which can be switched to a two-channel playback for a wider dispersal of the mono. The film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Disc two has a new 45-minute documentary, \\"Fellini's Homecoming\\", a video interview with Magali Noel, Fellini's drawings, audio interviews with Fellini and friends, as well as a book with a new essay by scholar Sam Rohdie, author of the \\"Fellini Lexicon\\", and a full text of Fellini's 1967 essay \\"My Rimini\\", which explores many of the ideas that were to make there way into the making of \\"Amarcord\\".aspect ratio of 1.85:1.

B002JCSWUW|3.0|I love sports movies, and I am quite a big fan of Matt Damon. Throw in Morgan Freeman, and I was sold. I wanted so badly to like it, but it was only okay.<br /><br />The movie opens with some sensationally remade news footage of Nelson Mandela (with Morgan Freeman inserted) to provide backstory. Mandela takes over the presidency of a very divided South Africa, and he tries to unite the country around its rugby team. As the story begins, the white fans cheer for the Springboks, while the black fans cheer against them, no matter what team they're playing. Matt Damon plays the rugby team captain, Francois Pienaar.<br /><br />The good: The acting was good, and at times great. Morgan Freeman completely captured Nelson Mandela's frailty and disposition. Matt Damon was good, although I didn't think he had too much to do. The two stars of this movie for me, however, were two supporting actresses, Leleti Khumalo and Sibongile Nojila. The women both played small roles; Khumalo worked for Mandela and Nojila was the Pienaar's maid. In the hands of other actresses, perhaps I wouldn't even have noticed them, but stealing a movie from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon is quite a feat, and I hope other take note. On the visual side, Eastwood never disappoints with aerial shots. There were quite a few breathtaking views, but otherwise, the movie was nowhere near his other works, especially the visually stunning Changeling (one of 2008's best movies, in my opinion).<br /><br />The not so good: This movie falls somewhere between a sports movie and a political movie, and for me, it failed at both. I admit, I know little to nothing about rugby. The climactic sports scene (it's hardly a spoiler, you know there will be one) was dull. I didn't understand how points were scored, how insurmountable leads are, or what the time on the clock was counting up or down to, and thus, I wasn't especially invested in the action. I knew the outcome, but good sports movies excel at providing an amazing, emotional magical journey. This film lacked magic. Not only did I not cry, I didn't even get goosebumps. I should be the target audience for this film; I adore sports movies, and I enjoy political movies. I like the actors in it. It certainly wasn't bad, but it simply didn't grab me. At the end, all I could say was eh. I didn't like it; I didn't dislike it. It wasn't memorable for me, despite being about a fascinating time.This film lacked magic.

B002WJ85ZE|5.0|I thought this was a great movie with lots of special effects, action, suspense, and comedy! I have never owned a G.I. Joe action figure, or seen the cartoon, so that's why I liked it for what it was. When the U.S. Army is delivering a nanotechnology-based weapon to NATO, Duke Hauser and Ripcord's team are attacked by a group called Cobra. They want to join General Hawk's G.I. Joe Team. Duke knows The Baroness, because they were going to get married years earlier. When Duke is kidnapped and brought to Cobra's lair, the group must stop Cobra from releasing the weapon that would bring the world to its knees, and save Duke while trying to make it out alive. I highly recommend G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA!!!
B002ONC9MS|5.0|An Education is based on Lynn Barber's memoir. Nick Hornby wrote the screenplay. Carey Mulligan is nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress (and many other acting awards). The entire cast is nominated for the Screen Actors Guild award.<br /><br />The barest of plot details: The film is set outside London in 1962. Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is sixteen, and one of the brightest students at her private girl's school. She wants to go to Oxford to read English literature. She meets a charming, friendly, older man.<br /><br />This film is perhaps the perfect coming of age story. Yes, I realize what a strong statement that is. Lynn Barber's story is not necessarily unique, yet it is a product of the time she was raised. Still, as someone who came of age in the 1990's United States rather than the 1960's Britain, it could have been my story. It is the perfect coming of age story because this dichotomy between uniqueness and everywoman-ness.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan is fantastic, but Peter Sarsgaard was mesmerizing. He completely nailed the British accent; I immediately checked [...] to see if he was, in fact, British. The entire cast is amazing, and the casting director deserves kudos as well. Rarely does one see a cast without a weak link. It's easily the best movie I've seen this year, and although there is some hesitation to such a bold statement, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'll see how well it stand up with time and multiple viewings, but this one is a modern classic. It's brilliant, moving, funny (Nick Hornby, remember) and immensely watchable and re-watchable. With the Oscars opening Best Picture to ten films this year, this one may have a shot at a nomination, and I hope it does.<br /><br />Seriously, it's the best movie I saw in 2009.
B001VAF5YO|5.0|Besides being filmed in the world's most awe-inspiring scenery, the beauty of UP is that it was made in the pre-politically correct era of hang gliding. The pilot, Ed Cesar, can be seen soaring at 15,000 feet above vast snow-covered mountains and lakes with neither helmet nor parachute on the most antiquated of wings. No apologies, no disclaimers, no long boring sermons about how safe modern hang gliding is (\\"safe hang gliding\\" - isn't that an oxymoron?). The flying and the sites are both quite risky, and it doesn't look at all safe when he somehow becomes detached from the glider and falls thousands of feet. How about when he takes the 12-year-old boy for a tandem flight, the child suspended to the wing only by his belt loops; can you imagine the outrage of child protection advocates today?<br /><br />UP is hang gliding at it's fantastic best - exhileration, scenery, danger; the spectacular views very much worth risking your life for. Save for a few brief exchanges between man and eagle, there is virtually no dialogue. The movie won an Oscar for Best Live Short Film in 1984.<br /><br />And, oh yeah, did I mention that it actually has a PLOT?<br /><br />Ed Cesar, died in 2002 from a brain aneurysm, proving once again that living is, in itself, more dangerous than hang gliding.
B000687M48|4.0|The music videos are great, exactly as expected. The concert is good too but one star reduced due to the filming method of the concert. The camera moves around too fast so you can't clearly see what's going on, makes ya sick, etc. Wish they didn't do that. Amy's voice is great throughout the concert. There is a backing track; I wish bands didn't use them.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I'll be brief as little I can say will influence whether or not you like Bob Dylan or this album.  I just want to give a little context.  When I heard that Bob Dylan had produced a Christmas album, I thought that he had finally \\"jumped the shark.\\"  No, worse, I thought that Big Media had just scored a direct hit at the heart of independent culture - the guy who declaimed about dimwitted comedians on half-lit stages ranting and raving and taking your money and you think it's funny ... now singing \\"Must be Santa\\". Only after reflecting a bit about the trajectory of Bob Dylan's work did I recognize that he's still the iconoclast, and he's showing us the way back out of the thicket of ersatz commercial culture and helping us to [re]discover authentic American music and culture - the stuff that existed before the Suits came with their formulas and metrics to own our collective souls.  Bob Dylan is Luke - not the Evangelist, but the Skywalker, lobbing one into the heart of the Death Star with this album.  Lighten up and listen to this subversive alburm.  I did, and I love it.  Aaaand, I can sing along without feeling self-conscious.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I am seeing the reviews here talking about the DVD collections blah blah.  The blu ray is the high definition with 1080p.  The DVD on my HDTV, it's subtitles looks horrible and most DVD movies does not have subtitles and sometime they use Closed Captions (CC) but HDTV with HDMI/Compoment with 1080p output would not display the CC texts on the screen since there is no CC decoder for HDTV.  All the blu ray movies has subtitles and their subtitle texts is in 1080p super sharp texts on the screen!  The Blu Ray is our best choice and it's really worth it to own it.  I know you guys feel it's a waste of the money but to me I love them.  I can't wait for Titanic (Blu-Ray) to come out.  Oh sorry I forgot to mentioned this that I am deaf since you wondered why subtitles/CC are important to me.  Cheers.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|Since the theatrical release of this movie, I have had plenty of time to anticipate its Blu Ray release. I never saw it in theaters and took in all the reviews and opinions over the past few months. I love horror movies, so I knew I would see it at some point, but I was careful not to believe all the hype, and took a more \\"wait and see\\" kind of approach. I just got the blu-ray version of this film for Christmas and watched it a little while ago, my first horror movie for the new year. Honestly, it was thoroughly entertaining and creepy throughout the movie, the best and scariest part being the last few minutes of the film. I also watched the alternate ending. I guess if I had to decide which ending I liked better, I would have to go with the theatrical version, but the alternate was very eerie as well. I do not feel as those who find themselves unable to sleep for weeks after seeing this film, but I can see myself looking over my shoulder at times. I am 51 years old, and have loved horror films since I was a young boy. But, putting it in perspective, I remember freaking out watching an episode the Twilight Zone back in the 60s and being unable to sleep that night. I think the younger crowd, for the most part, would be most frightened by \\"Paranormal Activity\\" and us older folks are more frightened by day-to-day events in the world than by a movie. Suffice it to say, I thought it was worth watching and should give you a few jolts, probably many more jolts if you are younger. Some people told me it was boring, which I did not find. It kept my attention from start to finish. The blu-ray transfer seemed fine, given the way it was filmed. I have no complaints in that department. So, if you haven't seen it already, and if you are at least curious, you might want to check it out, at least to see where your opinion fits in among all the others. If 2010 is no scarier than this movie, it will be a great year!
0515141429|4.0|Many reviewers pointed out the flaws in the Reacher books - he's a superhuman, knows everything etc. But I find his novels a nice escape although the writing style can get extremely annoying. Every character in the book constantly ends their sentences with \\"right?\\"<br /><br />It's one thing if one character has this speech tic but when every character does it, then I blame the editor for simply being lazy. And Since Child is a Brit, the editor should have cleaned up the Britbonics that this supposedly US soldier uses like mobile phones..they're cells over here.<br /><br />Complaints aside, it's still a fun ride. Nice to read about someone as smart, tough and dangerous as myself...
0786868724|4.0|\\"Have a little faith\\" is one of Mitch Albom's finest works.  It crosses the barriers of distance, belief, values and hopes to signal that we are all really on about the same thing.  My gratitude to Mitch and to the Rabbi and Minister for their generosity of sharing and caring.  For those of us who seek the Truth, this is one little signpost.  Highly recommended for anyone who is reflecting on what it means to serve humanity with grace and humility [[ASIN:0786868724 Have a Little Faith: A True Story]].
B000002GBD|5.0|Cranked out the 8 track tape for years. Still have it. Still works. Updated to the CD. This album rocks! Most people should know the title track, though few know the name of it. Very bold lyrics for 1975. All should know \\"Love Hurts\\". (Quite different from Gram Parsons.) But people should hear the whole album. Highly recommended.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I got my set today and I'm in love with it. It came in perfect condition. (some of the folders are a little bent and part of the front of the box is loose, but that can be fixed) So far, I haven't found anything wrong with the DVD's yet, but I'm only three DVD's in. The subtitles work well.
0740748475|5.0|The seller gave us a nice discount for the scratch on the outside cover of the collection.  Very nice of them.  The collection is beautiful.
0440178002|4.0|Shogun is unlike any other book I have ever read.  Slow at times, it takes its time developing a plot and growing some legs.  The number of characters is vast, and the speed at which they are introduced never slows.  I definitely learned much from this book.  Now when I see books or movies based in Japan where the characters have a western mindset I can't help but lough out loud.  The book developed the sense of cheap life and feudal hierarchy VERY well.    What is disappointing is the amount of sex.  It was entirely unnecessary, adding nothing to the character development.  It did however prohibit my children from reading it, which is too bad.
1400082773|2.0|The Presidential office is not a place to hone your salespitch or fulfill your dreams. The American people need a leader with more than \\"hope\\" and more than dreams.  I think his pretty words are well written in this book, but parsing the words and examining for content...  not much new and not much meat.
B000FCJZUO|2.0|First off Rosie Dunne is not a likeable character. For the life of me I cant understand why Alex is in love with her. He is a successful doctor and all she does is whine and she is soooooo depressed all the time. And every time they start to tell each other how they feel about each other something stands in the way. And that goes on chapter after chapter. If you like drawn out depressing books this is the book for you. However if you dont I would not recommend reading this book.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie is a cute \\"love\\" story between two robots (Wall-E and Eve) with a little fun adventure thrown in.  Definitely a movie both you and your children can enjoy watching together!
1594488843|5.0|Brilliant people -- if they are lucky -- have one good book in them; the next one often disappoints -- often there are no more after that.   Every new Dan Pink book makes me pause: \\"will this be as good as the last?\\"   I've yet to be disappointed.    Anyone who knows Dan knows how good his mind is (left AND right brains!).   They also know that he has a wise, witty, fun, and fast way to take some of us who are stuck . . . clean the lens of our telescope and sharpen our view of what sits on the horizon.  He also has a pattern of being annoyingly prescient. . . delivering an \\"aha\\" just when you've about run out of insights.  In the course of my work I see many C-Suite inhabitants who are scratching their heads about why their people aren't as excited about THEIR visions for their business as they are.    Turns out, most employees have little visceral connection to the change visions of newly minted, \\"fix the business or shut the lights\\" CEOs.   Like most successful people in Western culture, when the going kept getting tougher, the tough have simply done what they know faster, harder, quicker . . . and then wonder why things continue to deteriorate.  To paraphrase Dan, it worked well then . . . until it didn't!  We are left with employee \\"town halls\\" filled with stone-faced survivors who stare at a cheerleading -- just got off the jet CEO -- who can't wait until he/she gets back on the jet so they can refocus on survival.  We wait to hear about this week's \\"genius\\" who's going to save the company as much for dark entertainment as for anything else.  They'll tell us about \\"quick wins\\" and \\"low-haniging fruit\\" and about how valued we all are.  Whatever the talking head is saying is not connecting with me.   Tell us what you want and we'll figure ways to not do it because we don't believe in it and, anyway, we know there will be another genius talking head at the podium in 12 months.    Since the 80s we seem to have doomed ourselves to simply work harder and harder, shrugging our shoulders at diminishing returns and lately see a world that barely seems to make sense at all.  Our companys have lost their stories and their souls; and its been made pretty clear that there isn't a lot of incentive to buck the trend, let alone find work that fits our story. Once again, Dan Pink asks us to challenge our assumptions in a new world.   Unlike too many authors who rant only about what's broken, Dan offers us analysis, understanding, and an elegant shift in our lenses.      He has tapped the energy of a growing minority of talented folks who are drawn to \\"legacy companies\\" that have all but lost their ability to exist. It's no longer a matter of \\"can you grow this business by \\"x?\\"  It is \\"do we have enough time left for you to save/reinvent this business?\\"   These new leaders are excited by an innate and intuitive belief that they can DO something with these \\"brands\\" before it's too late.   And not because they're getting paid lots of cash . . . but because they want to be remembered as the person whose unique experience, insight, and passion made \\"that business\\" even better than it ever was, who found new ways to delight new customers.  We're weary:  of 5 steps & tools that don't work; of revolving CEO doors; of inane short-term decision-making that we know is setting us up for more ugliness.    Colleagues, this is one voice whose book is food for the journey as well as the soul.  You'll be refreshed by many deconstructions of assumptions that will make you wonder why you hadn't seen things in quite that way before.   And, in classic Dan Pink style, he makes sure that you will enjoy the ride.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I saw this 3 times in the theater and just knew i had to get this once it came out on DVD. Hope they bend and are able to make a soundtrack, but with so many different music on this dvd, i'm sure it must be the hardest thing to get the rights to put all that music on the same cd. I, like many others was just starting to get into Jack White. I already loved Page and The Edge and thought i knew them, but this movie really introduces these guys(all three) to music lovers. It is fun and wonderful seeing the love of music these gentlemen have. I guess we all can think of other past, present and now guitarists that can be in these men's places in this movie, Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton and so on. But for whatever reason, these three just seem to have been able to hit it off, their chemistry together is a once in a lifetime happening with three greats. It is a wonderfully inspiring film, for music lovers all around. Thanks Mr. Page, The Edge and Mr. White for a lovely time and teaching us and showing us what true musicians really are. Thanks.
B0009UC7QQ|1.0|Oh, that I could be so lucky as to have Truman's life. Not only does he get to break the spell of consumerism with which we're so bewitched, enslaved by, really. In Truman's \\"reality,\\" there really is somebody behind the controls and he's actually a very sweet man. The wizard, in fact, is not a munchkin gone power-mad, but just a down-on-his-luck fellow stuck in a box for so long that the touch of a woman is but a distant, stained-glassed memory.<br /><br />Everybody Loves Truman! What's there to complain about: Are you trying to tell me, Mr. Weir, (you, whose hippie-dippy \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" found Han Solo getting preachy, stuck in some frozen-in-carbonite jungle planet dreamworld), that we don't all want to be superstars, gawked at by every living human breathing thing? Do I instead want to discover that my life as an empty consumer chaneling my techno-slave ethics is merely due to somebody pushing a series of buttons behind the temporal screen? And I can forsake that and go meet my merry, beret-encrusted maker in Booth 33. And once ultimately in heaven, to then sit on a gooey cloud and weave tinkles from a 150-pound solid gold harp forever and ever and ever.<br /><br />I would much rather talk to you through my shaving mirror, wittious, without restraint, oh so very amusing in my \\"innocent\\" ways. Forrest Gump teams up with The Prisoner in this hapless, \\"Thelma & Louise\\" for the manly man's soul. Tarzan with a twinkle in his eye and a gymnastically inclined eyebrow and a tie hanging from his neck, a robotic Gomer Pyle spreading bland cheer like a throat coughs up the bubonic plague. Blindfolded ministers riding hamsters through the dark alleys with roses in their teeth, forest fires in their hearts.<br /><br />Saddest of all is how, with nary a quickened pulse, we demote the role of a human to a laboratory animal as a form of wholesome entertainment. No wonder we're going to hell in a ham basket, folks.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|I knew before I watched this not to expect much. Once I finally watched it, everything I had heard was pretty much confirmed. This movie was WAY overhyped and so slow through the first half, it's amazing so many people finished watching it. The second half of the movie, when things more noticable start happening and the womans attitude gets worse, the movie becomes more tolerable and even interesting. Just too bad that the second half wasn't the entire movie. It might have made it worth more than a rental.
1400032717|5.0|Definitely a cute and interesting story that I would recommend to anyone. While there are better books with much more riveting plots, this is still an addictive read that provides a great insight into the Autistic mind. It is funny and sad and you will not want to put it down.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This clear, hard case provides a nice, snug fit for my iPod Nano 5G. Clip is not removable, but I don't find that to be an issue for me. Good quality case, and a good value.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|A cult classic now. A fun piece extremely well done. The extra features are great in this DVD. The extra singing commentary is very clever and unexpectedly good (Who knew that Nathan Fillion could really sing). The clarity of the video is somewhat disappointing. It was clearer in the download version. But it's handy. You can pop it into any DVD player without worrying about an iTunes connection.
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama's \\"Dreams From My Father\\", gave me great insight into what it takes to discover yourself and learn greater respect for other people.  I read this book for my government class and I thought I wasn't going to like it.  It was quite lengthy (430 pages) and it took a bit longer to read than I expected because of all the details in the book.  I ended up liking it and would recommend it to anybody.  It helped open my eyes to other situations that other people go through.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I loved the other movies, waiting for this, i was disappointed. There was repetitive nonsense, and necessary scenes seem to b missing, then the end which was incomeplete, wasnt at all over the top, until the last \\"freindship\\" scene, what a shame! Im givin it 2stars for acting and graphics
1563894696|4.0|Batman Th Long Halloween is probably one of the best batman graphic novels I have ever read. I love the artwork. And the story line is brilliant especially the the fact that it includes Gotham's crime lords in the story.
B001FB4VZS|1.0|Pretty much every Smallville fan would tell you Season Six is the pinnacle of the show's creative power.  Season Seven went downhill with mostly filler episodes, though Supergirl was a welcome addition.  However, Season Eight falls flat on its face.  No Lex+No Lionel+Pretty Much No Supergirl+a trashy Doomsday= the worst season of Smallville ever.  This season, for the most part, moves at such a snail like pace that Days of Our Lives probably moves fast by comparison.      From what I understand, Season Nine so far REALLY goes back to Season Six like quality. Perhaps the quality went up because of the writer's strike- the writers could sit at home and think of some good Smallville for a change.  Regardless, you would do yourself a lot of justice to just skip over Season Eight and move directly to Season Nine.
B00204AA0O|5.0|As a huge fan of Regina Spektor, I believe that she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. However, if she keeps making the brilliant and clever music she's been creating, one day she will! With \\"Far\\", Regina shows that she has not lost touch with the creativity and personality that makes her music so great. She has, instead, perfected her unique style.    \\"Far\\" incorporates the classic Regina of \\"Soviet Kitsch\\"(`Wallet') and elements of \\"Begin to Hope\\"(`Genius Next Door'), along with its own sound and definite growth. It is her most upbeat record yet, and the lyrics and piano are still in top form. Drums accompany her piano on most of the songs. `Eet' contains a Fench Horn during the instrumental chorus. In `Blue Lips', a 12-string guitar is played modestly during the verses. `Man Of A Thousand Faces' makes good use of the upright bass. Other instruments worth mentioning include a tuba, some beatboxing, the cello and other strings.    Regina Spektor is a true talent and is essential to the music industry of today. \\"Far\\" is an excellent addition to Regina Spektor's repertoire, and carries the bright torch with no signs of dimming or burning out!    5 Stars!
B002VPE1AM|2.0|\\"Avatar\\" is an assault on the senses.  Filmed in 3D, it is grand on a truly colossal scale.  The viewer cannot help but be impressed or, potentially, overwhelmed.  Apparently twelve years in the making, it is not difficult to see why.  But, \\"Avatar\\" is more a massive piece of computer driven effects than physical drama.<br /><br />Infact, in spite of its enormous scale, I left the theatre after seeing \\"Avatar\\" somewhat disappointed.  The story line is weak and seems to be little more that a green tinged propaganda tale.  That is, greed is bad, the environment is sacred and anyone trying to do something different is evil.  The classic case of the little guy fighting back against the nasty capitalists.  I really do tire of the types of stories.  There is good and bad in all clashes.  It is rarely limited to just one side.<br /><br />I have little doubt that \\"Avatar\\" will be an outstanding cinematic success.  It has taken the industry in general and science fiction in particular to a whole new level.  If one were to compare \\"Avatar\\" with, say, \\"Jurassic Park\\" of some twenty years ago, the advances in cinematic technology are only too apparent.  \\"Jurassic Park\\" almost looks like the original version of \\"King Kong\\".  It is clunky where \\"Avatar\\" is seamless and smooth.<br /><br />But for all its technological wizardry, \\"Avatar\\" fails to deliver the goods.  It has a weak story line, clear prejudices and far from outstanding acting.  I'm sure my criticisms will do nothing to prevent people from seeing it.  It is, at the risk of repeating myself, a truly great experience and technically stupendous.  It's just a shame that it has nothing else to offer.
0375413405|3.0|I was very excited to purchase this cookbook after watching the movie Julie and Julia - like many of you, I'm sure. The first night, I cooked the Provençal Vegetable Soup, the Cauliflower au Gratin and the Reine de Saba cake. All three recipes turned out beautifully, and I was  happy to finally find a cookbook that made french cuisine easy to cook but still sophisticated to taste. The next day, I explored more of the recipes and made the Quiche au Roquefort and the onion soup. The onion soup was delightful, but the Quiche was an utter disaster. The recipe was EXTREMELY complex and difficult to follow due to a few clarity issues, and the end product was so rich it was inedible. Later, since I enjoyed the Reine de Saba cake so much, I tried the Chocolate Spongecake. Although the recipe was simple enough, the resulting cake could not hold its shape at all and could not come out of the pan even though I thoroughly buttered and floured it. So after my short experience, I think you should come into cooking with this book with an open mind, ready for both great success and failure. What can be guaranteed, though, is that when the recipe is a success, the cuisine is mind blowing delicious!
B001OQCV6K|4.0|It may be the fate of every popular character of screen fiction to be periodically redone; witness recent incarnations of James Bond and Batman.  In 2009's \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", director Guy Ritchie reimagines Holmes and sidekick Doctor Watson as Victorian Age action heroes.  Younger viewers may find the new Holmes and Watson quite exciting.  Older viewers familiar with Basil Rathbone or the superb Jeremy Brett may find this movie a little harder to like.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is surprisingly effective as Holmes, extraordinary private detective and now master of the martial arts.  Ritchie invents some interesting visual techniques that let us see Holmes' famous powers of deduction at work.  Jude Law is a younger, leaner, and two-fisted Doctor Watson.  The two actors have good screen chemistry together; they bicker like a married couple but are a seamless team.  Rachel McAdams is Irene Adler, a rather dangerous love interest for Holmes, in a role very much expanded from its original.  Kelly Reilly is a fiesty and believable Mary Moristan from \\"The Sign of Four\\" as Watson's fiance.  Victorian London is recreated in graphic CGI detail.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" may be more problematic, a complicated mess involving a Lord Blackwood (a sinster Mark Armstrong) as the serial-murdering leader of an occult society, who has aspirations of ruling the world from London.  There are a number of well-done dramatic action sequences, and some decent humor, but the movie is overly long and a major villian is left at large as obvious setup for a sequel.  This reviewer wishes Ritchie had reworked one of the original stories.<br /><br />\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is highly recommended as an entertaining experience for new fans of the iconic detective.  Older fans are encouraged to give the graphic novel-like presentation a try.
B001FB55I0|2.0|This movie was really boring. I couldn't stay up. The photography is dull. The final battle is too similar T1,T2 and Aliens and quite frankly expected more. I missed Arnold big time. The TV series is far superior.<br />I only managed to watch the directors cut and often the scenes/editing comes off as dull. Bale lacks any form of Charisma and Worthington is actually not required. Moon Bloodgood/Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted here. T3 may have had it's faults but it was far more entertaining than this, and the leads actually had better things to do. This movie reminds me of Mummy 3.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|These three movies are exceptionally brilliant in its concept,and truly a classic that is up there. The bullet-time effects were revolutionary. The assault on the military controlled building was excellent with its battle scenes. Truly fascinating. A collectors item.
B002TIWQNK|5.0|Obviously, the PSB's first Christmas release is not a proper Christmas CD.  There's really only one holiday song here - the previously released \\"It Doesn't Often Snow at Christmas.\\"  That song was first made available via a holiday gift to PSB fan club members circa 1997.  I never had a copy of the song before, although I'd heard it on various websites.  The Boys re-recorded the song with Marius de Vries handling the production.  The song is a predictably ironic take on Christmas, with Neil complaining - Christmas is not all it's cracked up to be/ Families fighting around a plastic tree/ Nothing on the TV that you'd want to see.  However, a hint of warmth is allowed - But I'll still have a glow at Christmas/ Because I'll be with you.<br /><br />The Boys also include a remake of Madness' \\"My Girl.\\"  Madness' version is a reggae-tinged frat boy plea for greater understanding - 'Cause everything I say/ She doesn't understand/ She doesn't realize/ She takes it all the wrong way.  PSB add enough gloom and darkness to their version to take it to an entirely different place.  In this version, the narrator clearly seems to be hiding something from his girl.  The irony of the gay duo covering this song are perfectly encapsulated in the lyrics - We argued just the other night/ I thought we'd got it straight/ She says I'm unaware/ And now she says I'm weak.  The maxi-single ends with the boy's self-produced \\"Our House\\" remix of \\"My Girl,\\" which adds a nice catchy synth line to the song along with some weird-sounding special effects that sound like dripping water (!?).<br /><br />The third song is a re-recorded version of \\"All Around the World\\" from the \\"Yes\\" CD.  The song has long been one of my favorites from the CD - an opinion shared by many pet-heads.  The rumor is that PSB wanted to release this as a single and agreed to re-record it in order to include it here.  The very danceable song is one of the most stereotypically PSB songs of recent years, reminiscent of their over-the-top songs such as \\"Left to My Own Devices.\\"  Sampling Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker,\\" the song is upbeat, joyous, and hedonistic in the tradition of other great PSB anthems.  The re-recording included here is fine.  They didn't change very much about the song other than some of the orchestration, which now sounds a bit more Christmas-y.<br /><br />The fourth song is a medley Coldplay's recent smash \\"Viva la Vida\\" and the boy's own \\"Domino Dancing.\\"  PSB had included this medley in many of their recent concerts, so its first appearance as an official release will undoubtedly make many fans happy.  I think the song is undeniably clever but doesn't work quite as well as some of their earlier medleys.  The song has gradually grown on me, though, and I'm glad that I have a copy of it.<br /><br />\\"Christmas\\" was not a big hit in the U.K., peaking at a meager #40 (PSB singles usually always make the Top 20).  The EP is a bit of a hodge-podge, so I can understand why it was not met enthusiastically.  However, I'm sure PSB fans of all types will love this CD.such as \\"Left to My Own Devices.\\"  Sampling Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker,\\" the song is upbeat, joyous, and hedonistic in the tradition of other great PSB anthems.

6304602944|5.0|Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash are narcotics detectives who, while both being extremely successful, can't stand each other. Crime Lord Yves Perret, furious at the loss of income that Tango and Cash have caused him, frames the two for murder. Caught with the murder weapon on the scene of the crime, the two have alibi. Thrown into prison with most of the criminals they helped convict, it appears that they are going to have to trust each other if they are to clear their names and catch the evil Perret. This movie packs a lot of punch.

B000NA28HU|5.0|A boy named Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest. At first, he thinks it's a lucky discovery, something that will bring meat to his poor family for the winter. Instead, it brings a dragon hatchling, and Eragon is soon thrust into a world of magic and power through which he and the dragon must navigate. I loved this movie. This movie is perfect for a family with children of various ages.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I got this for christmas from as I am an avid fan of Alan Moore's Watchmen. One of the distinctive features of this version to all the other dvd releases is that this one contains all the deleted/bonus scenes in the main cut of the movie as well as the short animated \\"Tales from the Black Freighter\\". It views alot more like the graphic novel than the theatrical or the extended cuts. What this means is that this movie is long. I think it works greatly, however, and gives this cut a sense of completeness. I highly recommend this for the true/avid Watchmen fans, not for the casual viewer. The entire extended cut with Tales from the Black Freighter fit in a single disc, leaving the other disc to contain the special features, which is a really nice touch. It also comes with a digital copy (for those who like that) and the entire \\"Under the Hood\\" dvd.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|America's first supermodel Gia Carangi lives hard and dies young in the glamorous, excessive urban wilds of 1970s New York City. The movie takes you deeper and deeper into a personality you feel you are part of, but are scared to become. This is a story with love, hatred, pain, joy, and many other emotions. Gia is superbly acted by Angelina Jolie, who captivates the true escence that the real Gia once had. I recomend this movie highly.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|I felt the images were a little grainy for a 1080p blu-ray like many other older movies that were re-released as Blu-Ray.    I still would recommend buying this for the extended scenes.  In the original, we assumed the character's thoughts/feelings through their facial expressions or small acts, but with the extended scenes, they become clear.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|Four prep-school students discover they have supernatural powers. When one of them uses the powers for less than altruistic purposes, there are catastrophic results. Renny Harlin has done a fabulous job on this film. the acting was perfect, and the graphics were amazing. This movie is great.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|PQ and sound are top notch as reviewed in most posts. PQ cannot compares to current top crop Blu Ray but consider when the film was produced, it should get a 5 stars for PQ and sound.    I really want to comment on the access issue or the lack of it. Due to some posted problems or long delay in viewing this version, I put off buying this version for a while. There was no issue at all with my Samsung BP1500 player. The first screen indicated my player is not hooked up to the internet, there was option of connect or cancel. I pressed cancel. About 5 or 10 seconds later, another screen pop up stating that my player is 2.0 version, I pressed enter. It then came to the menu screen. I scrolled down and choose the special edition. A couple more clicks, no problemo as Arnold mentioned in the movie. : )    I also want to comment on the great service from Amazon. Most of my purchases came earlier then predicted arrival time. This disc and two other items didn't arrived as stated. After emailed to Amazon, this disc and two other items arrived the next day. The original ship item still somewhere lost in transit. 5+ stars for Amazon service!!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Former heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) steps out of retirement and back into the ring, pitting himself against a new rival decades after his initial glory. When a computer simulated boxing match declares Rocky Balboa the victor over current champion Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon, the legendary fighter's passion and spirit are reignited. But when his desire to fight in small, regional competitions is trumped by promoters calling for a rematch of the cyber-fight, Balboa must weigh the mental and physical risks of a high profile exhibition match against his need to be in the ring. This movie makes you smile and wins your heart.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I picked up the Sherlock Holmes Complete Collection because my mom had already downloaded it and I was mildly curious.  Holmes was the best book I've read in a while, definately my favorite in the Mystery genre.<br /><br />I love the characters.  Doyle whips up such fantastically real people out of no where with the most outrageous situations and stories.  The main characters are priceless.  Holmes has a very deep compassion for humanity buried among his quirks and strange habits.  Watson is such a genuine, sympathetic companion and narrator that it feels like a friend telling a story over coffee.<br /><br />Let me put it this way, I'm bitterly upset that I finished the series.  Bitterly.  I wish with all my heart that I could just have a fresh Sherlock Holmes mystery every day.  Definately a book I'll pick up again and recommend to everyone I know.  My brother read them when he was a preteen/teenager, and I loved them at 24 y/o.  I'm sure that a more mature audience would appreciate Holmes, also.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie is an expertly-made thriller. Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years. The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witnesses, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's a perfect hit.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Yes, its overhyped and very low budget! The actors are not slick hollywood types and there were a couple parts where they could have made it scarier by doing less - or nothing (the o. board cathing on fire was a little groan inducing). But oh boy did this get scarier and creepier as it went on!   If you get it and watch it as a pure fun little thrill ride and don't expect too much - what do you want for $15,000!!!???!!! Then, you will like this!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|A science professor's untraditional hypotheses have made him the laughing stock of the academic community. But on an expedition in Iceland, he and his nephew stumble upon a major discovery that launches them on a thrilling journey deep beneath the Earth's surface, where they travel through never-before-seen worlds and encounter a variety of unusual creatures. This movie is the most entertaining 3-D movie I've ever seen.

B000957O7S|5.0|In New York, Alex Hitchen is a kind of sentimental advisor, teaching each client how to date the woman of his dream. His present case is helping the clumsy Albert to date the wealthy and powerful Allegra Cole. Meanwhile, Hitch has a crush on the gossip columnist Sara, who was assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch, she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation. From the opening credits to the closing, I was laughing all through. There is something in this movie for everyone.  The cast has great chemistry. This movie has comedy as well as a metaphor. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
1440469563|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B00003CXGG|5.0|Tough ex-cop Han Sing travels from Hong Kong to America to find justice for his brother, who was murdered in an ongoing battle between Chinese and African-American gangs. Han soon takes his brother's place in the war and becomes entangled in the violence, until he falls in love with Trish, the daughter of the rival gang's leader. Jet Li is in top form in this movie as he jumps, kicks, and flips with a quick and flawless grace of a dancer. Jet Li fight work and chemistry with costar Aaliyah makes this a very entertaining movie.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Getting the DVD is great since watching a two-plus hour movie does require a pause button on occasion.  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fascinating look into the life of a man who is aging backwards.  Interestingly, that aspect of the movie is a bit underplayed.  The movie centers around a woman who is dying on her hospital bed, her daughter who is coming to realize who her father actually is, and a howling Hurricane Katrina right outside their door.<br /><br />The flashbacks ensue and are wonderfully correographed.  I enjoyed the shadow and light, almost like a silent movie in its rendition.<br /><br />The movie starts with a man who invents a clock that goes backwards, placed in a train station.  The implication was that at its creation, its effects upon one man, Benjamin, were to be prophetic.  The movie is a bit overly long.<br /><br />There are several great scenes:  being taken for a walk and made to fend for himself when he is only 7 (but looks 87).  The preacher who tells him to walk.  The first time his biological father attempts to abandon him as \\"a monster.\\"  Benjamin's first visit to a brothel.  His World War II experience on a tug boat.  The elusive hummingbird and what he means.  Well, I guess that's better than a raven.  :)<br /><br />The movie in many ways is rather ordinary, especially the second half, with Cate Blanchett competently playing the woman in his life, who find and takes care of Benjamin as he gets younger, and younger.<br /><br />The director did this movie well, with special effects, lots of aging make-up, but did not play this fantasy unrealistically.  There were even parts that made me cry.  Hate that!<br /><br />Beautifully made film; just wish it were a bit shorter.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|When an informer, his family and two FBI agents are killed by an international gang of drug dealers, Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett and Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs are assigned to work undercover for the FBI in a joint operation to disclose which agency leaked the information to the criminals. They plot a scheme to approach with their team of agents to the manager Jos&eacute; Yero and later to the druglord Arc&aacute;ngel de Jes&uacute;s Montoya. Along the mission, Sonny meets the accountant, investor and mistress of Montoya, Isabella, and after a romantic affair, they fall in love for each other, blurring his professional commitment with his personal feelings. This movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining. Michael Mann made a movie that was just pure magic it does have a very good second half and a good replay effect to it. Shoot out was realistic and great.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|This movie was the best piece of escapism I've seen in a long time.    I don't understand all the harsh reviewing about this movie. You'd seriously have to have a sharp stick up your backside to dislike such an interesting movie. People are saying this movie is the same as Dances With Wolves, so, sure... the scenario is similar. But then, Dances With Wolves is a lot like the scenario from the story of Pocahontas. So then, Pocahontas could have come from Romeo and Juliet, too?    And how many times do we have to see the vampire and the human fall in love? Lestat, Armand, Edward, Angel...     Scenarios for movies can and should be played with again and again, so they can be molded different ways with different sounds and looks.    The music was beautiful, and no way too much like Titanic or Braveheart. It was dramatic music for a beautifully made movie. It had both sad and upbeat tribal chanting and singing,with gorgeous drums accompanying. I personally love Jake's First Flight, and I See You by Leona Lewis.
B000GRUMQ4|5.0|It is New Year's Eve, and over 2,000 passengers & crew are ringing in the New Year aboard the huge cruise ship 'Poseidon' on the open sea in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean! A small group of survivors find themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain's orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fiancee--a young couple who hours before couldn't summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges. Along the way they are joined by a single mother and her wise-beyond-his-years son, an anxious stowaway and a despondent fellow passenger who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn't want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other. This is a fun, adventure movie that keeps you pretty much on the edge of your seat. Worth seeing, great visual affects, fast paced, action/adventure.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|My son got this as a Christmas gift!  He loves Star Wars and this is no exception.  I love that I can let him watch a show when he asks and still have plenty of time to play outside, etc.  The DVD set is very nicely done.  There are 4 dvds two on each inside cover and in the center is a built in booklet of sketches, Star Wars info, and of course the DVD contents.  We don't get to see them on TV so hopefully a 2nd season will come out soon to DVD.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|This is a really great movie. It's really rare to have a movie with so many astounding special effects that will make you hold your breath. It's not all about the special effects. This movie has a mind blowing sad and disastrous story. The world is coming to an end, as its getting into a new ice age. Think that not real? Well, experts say this could happen. This movie really gives you something to think about.
076532413X|1.0|This is the \\"dean of Canadian science fiction writers\\"?  Poor characterization, poor plot development, and ludicrous dialogue lead me to believe otherwise.  I can see why the TV series, which is not stellar either, borrowed the title and basic plot and little else.  Could not even finish it.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|We rented this video for our then 2.5 year old last year and decided to buy it this year as she has loved it since first seeing it. The story is sweet, the music is beautiful and the images are a storybook come alive. This is a classic that I never tire of, which is a good thing as it gets played many many times.
B00000K0T8|5.0|This is another Wu banger that seems to get overshadowed by the previous year solo releases of GZA's Liquid Swords and Raekwon's Only Built For Cuban Linx. In my opinion Ironman should not take a backseat to either of these two classics. It is worthy of classic status in its own right. RZA is his usual razor sharp self with the production. Once again he delves into the early 70's soul samples and dark keyboard tones mixed with dialogue from various films that were so ubiquitous on Liquid Swords and OB4CL. Ghost's frenetic delivery is complemented nicely with Raekwon's steady and confident lyrical stylings. But ironically the lyrical highlight of the album belongs to neither Ghostface or Raekwon. That honour is bestowed upon Cappadonna who spits a long, freewheeling, in your face verse on posse cut 'Winter Warz', my favourite song on the album.    Top 5 tracks  1. Winter Warz  2. Camay  3. Daytona 500  4. Iron Maiden  5. After The Smoke is Clear ft. Delfonics    Rating: 87/100
B0021L8UPS|4.0|This movie was not what I expected at all.  I thought a mildly gory \\"bad seed\\" tale.  Instead, I was fascinated with the story, the acting, especially by \\"the Orphan\\" aka Esther, \\"Max\\" and Vera (the actress).  Some might have felt the pace was slow, and yes, there were plot holes, but the pace added to the suspense, the plot holes kept some mild amusement, and \\"Huh?\\" moments, but that just made the film as one reviewer indicated a worthy candidate as a cult classic.  The attention to details to create a compelling personality in Esther is to be commended.  I recommended it to two friends who watched it after I did and they loved it too.  Both felt Isabelle deserved an Oscar nomination and that she is an actress to watch.  A very impressive thriller and the ending, although was both suprised and yet not, was one of the best plot twists I've seen in ages. Well done filmaking and acting.

0312370830|5.0|This book was written by a French woman about a part of French history that older people who remember the past never speak of and wish to forget; that this shameful event is never told to the young, they need never to know of this.  This was nothing to be proud of, the young do not need to know of this their elders feel.       Or should the truth be known?  There is the question  of people's   right to know whether good or bad?  Or possibly bad events should be forgotten as though they never happened?  This is what this particular book goes; the story to be told, fictional but in part too true.    In 1942 thousands of Jews were sent to the Velodrome d'Hiver,a large indoor stadium which has been torn down.  Families were divided,separated from each other never to see or hear of their loved ones. Mothers and children, some just babies were torn apart, the mothers were sent to work camp, the children to death camps.The French police were responsible for this crime against humanity.  The French people were indifferent and did nothing to stop these heinous crimes.  This book deals with one of these displaced families.    Ten year old Sarah is taken away from her parents and little brother.  She does not know where they are or if they are even alive.  She runs away from the camp to which she was taken and is adopted by an older couple, the Dufaures who were grandparents and also by Monsieur Tezac who moved into Sarah's vacated apartment and found out about her position.  This man sends the Dufaures money to take care of Sarah; the Dufaures and their son, daughter-in-law, and grandsons treat her as though she is one of their own.  Madame Dufaures tells Sarah she has always wanted a daughter or granddaughter and Sarah fits the bill.  When Sarah is twenty she moves to the United States to get away from painful memories.  She is a sad young woman.    Of these people, Monsieur Tezac, his son Eduord and the Dufaure family are tormented by feeling of guilt which they had no reason to feel.  They had done the right thing.    Sixty years later a lady journalist, Julia Jarmond, an American living in Paris and married to an arrogant, conceited Frenchman is given the assignment to write about this terrible time in French history.  She is working for an American magazine.  She becomes deeply involved in the story of Sarah and her family and delves deeply into finding out the story of the woman who had been a child during this time.  Perhaps this involvement in Sarah is to take away from the pain of her unhappy marriage to her handsome, adulterous husband. She finds out what she needs to know and tells all.  Some people don't like this and feel this needs to be forgotten because the truth would hurt their decendsnts.  Julia's father-in-law, Eduaod is the much better man than his son Bertrand.  And people involved knew what happened though others thought it better kept a secret.      This is a passionate revealing book.  The book chapters go from Sarah to Julia one chapter dealing with Sarah the next dealing with Julia.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Don't go in expecting a concert experience.  I admit the start was a bit slow..but I realized this is a rehearsal and seeing the REAL mike in person. Truly a perfectionist.  In the past, I never liked how the media portrays him so poorly and accusing him of all those charges..    Overall, a must see for Michael fans and allowing us to see he is just an ordinary man with BIG dreams and hopes.  He does it by strong emotion, with the love of his fans. Too bad there was no moon walk in the movie :(  the Earth song seems to be the only one complete in the movie. Some may think his a control freak but he is not!! You have to think from MJ's perspective and how hard it takes to put this all together and coordination!!
B0012YYZYK|4.0|I rented this on Blu-ray and was amazed at how it sounds.  I listened to it in True-HD and I do not think I have heard a better sounding \\"live\\" concert. Really amazing and the mix is not over done.  I think 5.1 mixes should be done to make the music sound more realistic with depth and clarity and this does that.    Only complaint is that they really do not use the center speaker and all and the movie cuts into songs and I really don't care about the movie footage, I just want to see the songs performed without interruption. They should re-edit the film and place all movie footage between songs!!
B001AVCFK6|2.0|I was so psyched to finally watch this movie. I guess I was just expecting to much. I thought the whole story line was ridiculous. It botherd me that the federation starships kept getting there ass handed to them..including 7 starships at once. I was hoping to see an updated version of the \\"Wrath of Khan \\" starship showdown. Got a lame ass ending instaed. Old spock/new spock...bleh...And jeez...couldn't they just take out the drilling machines chain with a couple of well placed photon torpedo shots???? I watched District 9 and enjoyed it much more than Star Trek...
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I feel that this book was shamelessly written to be a movie script. In some places I can imagine it saying on the sidelines 'enter villain'. That being said, I enjoyed it anyway for the light reading it is. It is NOT a religious text, it is NOT a philosophical text, it is just a thriller/mystery. If you don't like the man's slant on life then don't read his books. Also, I have to agree that he was getting a little 'Robert Jordan' with the symbology.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Dumb..Dumb..Dumb....Its gets one star for the cool yellowstone eruption..Last 30-45 minutes of the movie were one of the most ridiculous I have ever seen. You have been warned...
B002XTBE8I|5.0|I put in a few words about RELAPSE when it came out, and I would have to say that these new tracks are far better than the original album as a whole.  I think REFILL is some of Eminem's best work since THE EMINEM SHOW.  My hope is that, given this progression, I can infer that RELAPSE 2 will continue this progression in the right direction.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|This is no Gene R. story. The storyline is thin, and it throws away much of the Star Trek Cannon that has existed for decades. Why? Because Paramount hired a hack to direct and write this stuff, and the rest of the spineless Paramount parasites with no vision signed off on this film. If you are a long term Star Trek fan, you will be left asking, \\"what happened\\"?  If you have never seen a Star Trek movie, tv series, book, or recording, you may think this is good entertainment. However, the storyline is unsustainable, a very large flaw that Paramount overlooked while making this movie, and the very reasoning behind this movie will leave most Star Trek fans wondering who the heck thought this was a good idea. Bad science, poor character development, terrible scripting. Try and find the one character in this film that doesn't punch Jim Kirk in the face....
0812973992|4.0|I found Let the Great World spin to be an interesting series of intertwined stories.  The book has a poignant melancholy about it, as all the stories involve tragic loss.  But at the same time, the author does a nice job giving glimpses of human beauty, even in those who society generally discards.<br /><br />The intertwining stories are loosely connected by a tight rope walker who illegally walked between the newly built, but not yet completed World Trade Center towers in the 1970's (the movie Man on Wire documents his feat.  Pretty amazing).  The connection never really worked for me.  I struggled understanding how the wire walker had anything to do with the characters; it seemed like the author picked an event out of a hat and just went with it.  I suppose the wire walker cements the story in a specific period when the twin towers represented hope and promise prior to their demise on 9/11, but the connection to the actual characters was clumsy. Some reviews call this a 9/11 book, but that seems anecdotal, as only the final section takes place post 9/11, and even that does not draw any connection between the characters and the twin towers.<br /><br />Some of the mundane stuff in this book is drawn out too long, as the author appeared to be more worried about each descriptive word he used than tying the plot together.  I expected a little more intrigue in how these vastly different lives diverged.<br /><br />So all in all, this a well written book that brings the reader into the lives of diverse and interesting characters; but that is about as far as it goes.  As a story...its just so-so.  If Amazon did half stars, I would have gone with 3 1/2, but its definitely better than 3....not quite sure it's a 4 though....
B000KFB4PK|1.0|My 5-year old grandson was thrilled that I got him this watch for Christmas; however, 8 days later one of the hands fell off, not due to rough treatment. It is a cute watch but the lack of durability is very disappointing.
B0000041WM|5.0|*Spoiler Alert*  Pavarotti shows \\"Possente amor mia chiama\\" who is boss and then aims, shoots for, and nails a high D at the end. Yes, no surprises there, but just had to throw it out there.    One of my favorite aspects of this recording is the casting of Shirley Verrett. Verrett takes command of this role and steals much attention with her versatile instrument. Such drama from her! Her presence adds to an already wonderful ensemble for the third act quartet. Magnificent! In addition to Shirley Verrett, we've got Nicolai Ghiaurov and his extremely dark tone. As expected, Leo Nucci makes for a perfect Rigoletto, the fool who is pushed too far... June Anderson provides us with a vibrant Gilda with an articulate voice. Father and daughter produce an exciting \\"Figlia! ...Mio padre!\\" And, of course, don't forget about the wonderful orchestra. What a driving force!    I have heard my fair share of Rigoletto performances and have to say I cherish this particular recording. I highly recommend.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I missed this all when it was on TV but am glad to be catching up with it now on DVD.  This is not some sappy chick fest, but instead is the ongoing story of a single mom and her precocious daughter, the small quirky town they live in, its interesting inhabitants, and the snooty school that the girl Rory attends because she wants to be Harvard-bound.  The dialogue is rapid-fire, with hilarious banter.  The other people, such as Luke, Miss Patty, Sookie, and the snobbish guy at the inn's front desk, are all intriguing to watch, as are the obnoxious students at Rory's school.  What's even better is the obligatory Friday night dinner at Lorelai's parents' house, where the wayward daughter who gave birth at 16 must continue to face her uptight parents so they will keep paying  Rory's tuition.    Great fun and some of the best writing from the world of TV.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|While some might be dettered by the extra price of this special edition, the extras are worth it. The actor interviews that they did are hilarious and lets you get to know many of the actors who play smaller roles, which I found fascinating. The movie itself is one that is better if you have read the book before hand, but it was very well done despite that.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Some spoilers below.................                  There is almost nothing extra on this DVD besides a weak alternate ending and a preview for Shutter Island.    Otherwise, however, this is an updated, higher tech version of The Blair Witch Project, but with much more intimacy, since it takes place entirely inside a nice house in San Diego, on a quiet suburban street that seems very tranquil.  Micah and Katie are beset by noises, moving objects, lights going on and off, and, as we eventually discover, a demonic presence which has been after Katie since she was a young child.  Her BF Micah, for the most part, is more interested in his camera work than in the dangerous situation that she is in...until it is too late.    He makes a terrible mistake in bringing in the Ouija board, and I still think calling an exorcist might have helped this unfortunate couple.  The strength of the movie lies in the fact that it does not depend on blood and gore for effect; instead, it works on the viewer's psyche and makes the imagination run wild. What we don't see is always more frightening because our worst fears run away with us.

B0002S943O|1.0|I find it difficult to understand the nearly unanimous enthusiasm for this music and production. I've always liked Depeche Mode, in a casual way. I liked Kraftwerk more back when they both were pioneers. I thought a Depeche Mode DVD would be a good addition to my other music DVD's and a nice one to have when Blondie, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Offspring, and the like just didn't fit the bill.  I based this choice somewhat on reviews I read here. I was a little apprehensive from the start of anything titled, \\"Devotional\\", and as it seems now, rightfully so.<br /><br />Most all of the songs start with promise, musically appearing to be developing a theme and a direction, then almost universally sputtering out, going nowhere of compelling interest and the lyrics are most effective when most sparse it seems.  I couldn't make myself finish most of the pieces while anxiously hoping the next would be better. On the first disc there was just one track I liked; the lyrics of which consisted of five words, three of which I could never decipher though ultimately mattering little.<br /><br />The production, stage designs, and lighting were reminiscent of Cirque du Soleil to me, and the boxes with translucent back lit screens containing various things seemed like a rip-off of Stop Making Sense, which this pompously ceremonious fluff should not dare be mentioned in the same breath with. To me it all felt stilted and over done.  When the songs start getting word heavy in a clumsy attempt to advance the whole devotional theme I find myself desperately looking for the exit, which luckily is just one click away on the remote control.<br /><br />It all seems like a caricature of what it could have been.<br /><br />I felt it my duty to add this dissenting, minority opinion, and wonder why my reaction to it all is so at odds with so many reviewers.  It may work well for devoted fans, but it didn't work for me.  Slick production values in all aspects, including the DVD box.  Lots of style, not much life. I probably shouldn't have written this without even viewing DISC 2, but..I just couldn't do it!have written this without even viewing DISC 2, but..I just couldn't do it!
B00004VVND|4.0|Another superb fantasy from the Seventies.  Michael Crichton proves to be as stylish a filmmaker as he is a fanciful storyteller.  Not classic stuff but terrific popcorn entertainment.  Crichton's story here seems to anticipate his \\"Jurassic Park\\" some years later.  I can see flashes of Spielberg here.  I'm sure it's a mutual admiration society.  My only question:  It seemed to me that there's more robots and technicians than actual tourists.  How are they ever going to make any money?  Another observation is that our hero here is a lawyer played by Richard Benjamin.  Twenty years on the baddie in \\"Jurassic Park\\" was also a lawyer.
B002EA4IO8|5.0|Hard to say that you love this book when it is such a horrible subject.  The author handled it very well, from a 9 year old's perspective - even using the names The Fury and Out-With because that is how he heard them.
B00004VVNB|4.0|The appeal of \\"Logan's Run\\" is much like that of the original \\"Star Trek\\".  Mildly intriguing story lines with arch acting and cheesy costumes, effects, and art direction.  In a way I kind of prefer these sci-fi films from a more innocent time before CGI obliterates the craftmanship that went into these films.  \\"Logan's Run\\" is at once fascinating and campy.  It addresses pet Seventies issues like overpopulation and the environment.  It's a little dated but still retains the fun factor.  My only gripe is that it suffers a little bit from overlength and beats it's message into the ground somewhat.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|Of course, you'll have to suspend all common sense to get through this digital effects sci-fi 'thriller,' But you'll be very entertained, even if the plot has holes like the Grand Canyon. Why do these terrorists want to nuke LA? We are not told. I guess they planned to commit suicide when the bomb goes off. Anyway, Nick Cage plays a Vegas magician with \\"precognition,\\" i.e., he sees the future, but only 2 minutes ahead and only if it involves himself. Just for ha-has, they make him fall for luscious Jessica Biel, because who wants to look at balding, jowly Nick Cage for 90 minutes? He is way, way too old for Jessica, but no matter. The avalanche and the nuclear explosion look very digital, as do the many scenes of Nick melting and morphing and zigzagging backward and forward in time. Smartly, this is very quick at 90 minutes, and you won't be bored.

B001JNNDGA|4.0|As anyone can see just from the comments, Jesus is the still most important person ever to live on earth. The heart of the matter, who IS Jesus? He offended the important because he sojorned with the lowly. He spoke hope to those who would hear. His message resounds even today as many celebrate His birth, although the noise floor of modern life and media would drown it out.     Mankind's wholesale will to err and inability to adhere to moral or ethical standards doesn't invalidate the standard. The message Jesus brought is certified by our very nature to sin. Our own efforts to be moral from any cuiltural or religious perspective would eventually lead to hatred of Jesus. As seen in the film, among the motives the Sanhedrin had to kill Jesus was fulfill a commandment to execute a blasphemer.    No film until \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" had shown how Jesus was marred more than any man. The deliberate depiction of the process of His execution shows that God loves us enough to send His own Son to die a cruel death that we might be saved. Anyone who understands Jesus' mission and still is not moved by this film is truly numb in heart. The gift Jesus brought us was rejected yet not taken back. We can still have what Jesus bought for us with His death. Who else can love like that?    We need the Savior, now more than ever.

0156012197|5.0|This book has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It's a wonderful tale of a young boy (The Little Prince) who decides to travel to other planets to see what else is out there. He comes across many adults doing the things that adults do and wonders why they have no time to enjoy life. Then when he travels to Earth he meets a pilot and teaches him the joys of life and how to notice the truly important things in life. Every adult should read this book at some point in their life; it will change the way you look at life.
0312380852|5.0|I ordered this site unseen and was pleasantly surprised.  I was anxious to start learning so I looked everywhere for the cords she recommended and couldn't find them in the local stores, so I placed and order online.  In the mean time I bought some waxed linen to practice on and I really had trouble with the harder knot, the double half hitch.  I couldn't seem to get it right. I was discouraged because I usually succeed at these type of things. When I finally recieved the tuff cord that she recommended, the trouble was over.  I was able to make an intermediate bracelet right off the bat. Now I am in the middle of the necklace that features the double half hitch knot.  You really should order online the tuff cord nylon cording when you order the book. The projects turned out beautiful. The instructions were very easy to understand and the jewelry that she designs is beautiful. The only drawback is it can be intensive on your back when you sit and knot for a while.
B001USHRCK|4.0|We are hardcore Lego builders...this is the fifth Lego Castle set we've purchased in the last two years, along with a few dragon sets, Indiana Jones, and Harry Potter's castle (although not the $400 one, alas). So far, this set was the least fun to assemble, due to the fact that the over 1600 pieces were NOT SORTED. That's right... the first 30 minutes of Lego joy were diluted by sorting the pieces into colored piles across the dining room table. Not sorting by color makes a multi-hour assembly stretch into days as you futilely search for a single black brick of a certain size amongst the dark browns, tans, dark grays...you get the picture. To make matters worse, there were several pieces missing from the set (unheard of in our experience). Fortunately, we were able to swap out pieces from our other sets, but all Lego builders know this seriously interferes with the Zen-like rhythm of construction. After the disappointing assembly, fortunately the village is good. There are several of the engaging special features that make these sets worth the money, and the houses themselves hold together with rough handling and only require minimal tune ups after several hours of creative play. There are lots of extras (food, leaves for the tree, barrels and chests to store stuff, spears and knives, cows, etc). This would have received a five star rating except for the poor organization of the pieces and what I hope is aberrant quality control.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I guess I'm just a dunce, but I struggled to follow the characters well in the letter/telegram format.<br /><br />I found the specific stories about WWII excellent, both vivid and uplifting while not dimishing the severity and horror of wartime.<br /><br />My problem was I couldn't really get into the 'present' story going on. It all seemed a little fluffy and cutesy and failed to compel me.<br /><br />Although after reading so many great reviews of this book I have come to the conclusion that maybe I'm the one who should have been paying more attention?!?!
B001FB55H6|3.0|I am a fan of the Watchmen movie, preferably the 'Director's Cut' version.  Because I wasn't familiar with the source material , I could watch the film without preconceptions.  I first watched it without the sound on, just reading the subtitles.  Sleeping babies can affect your movie watching capabilities. I was able to take in purely the visual aspect of it - on that basis alone, the film succeeded for me.  Hearing it with the sound on changes the emotional tone completely - it is even more dramatic. I do wonder how it would have been with hardly any music. It does not need much.  Now, after watching the Director's Cut a few more times, I've begun to make more sense of it. I realise that the film is all about people who are coming to terms with their lives and that some are not afraid to make drastically dangerous decisions, without concern for morality. For this reason, it can be a hard film to sit through. There are periods in the film (such as the trip to another planet) where two of the characters talk and one of them mentions how it is so scientifically fascinating that a person is born - the event of life creation is described in beautiful language. The scene has a great sadness and weight to it, seeming somehow timeless.  At the same time, the film has some quite violent sections. I hope this gives you an idea of how much is going on in it.  All the actors fit their roles incredibly well, the world of the movie is believable, effects work seamlessly and overall it is an offbeat and rather long movie - demanding is an accurate word.  It is very dark and explores failure as a theme, similar to 'The Dark Knight'. Perhaps part of the reason the film got made is good timing - 'The Dark Knight' was very successful and took the superhero movie somewhere else.   I recommend you rent it to see what you think of it - whether you look at the source material is up to you.  If you find yourself intrigued by the film, you will likely then need time to watch it again as you felt able to 'take it in' over several viewings, which is what worked for me.  You could call it a drama with a comic book aspect or vice versa.  I'm glad it got made and that it has caused such intense scrutiny.  I don't plan to read the source material - after all, some of us just want to see the film, not read the book.  What a film it is.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|Rented this movie for a day on the Video on Demand and the quality was amazing and the video itself was better than expected. Subtle humor was nice to see and the story line was really easy to keep along. Would definitely recommend watching this movie.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The dvds came early. Product was used but was in very good condition. So far only a couple glitches in play back that cleaning can clear up. I'm not done watching it yet. I am very satisfied with my viewing so far.
0316044938|5.0|\\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. In newspaper photos of missing girls from the seventies, most looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair. This was before kids of all races and genders started appearing on milk cartons or in the daily mail. It was still back when people believed things like that didn't happen.\\"<br />- The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold<br /><br />This is how we first meet young Susie Salmon, who is adjusting to her new home in heaven, which is turning out to be different from what she'd expected.<br /><br />Her life hasn't ended with her death. Susie is still haunted by her killer and she returns to Earth to watch him and to look in on those she loves. Her younger sister Lindsay copes with the sympathetic murmurs and inquisitive glances by toughening up. Her baby brother Buckley keeps asking when she'll be back. While her father struggles to find her killer, her mother starts to drift away.<br /><br />As she visits Earth, Susie continues to grow into herself, exploring, learning, and always keeping her sense of humor. Suzie is drawn to Ruth, a quirky and brilliant schoolmate that she'd encountered during her last moments. And Suzie is intimately aware of Ray Singh, whom she had been falling in love with, the only boy that she'd kissed.<br /><br />You may expect the story of a young girl who was raped and murdered to be intense and depressing but The Lovely Bones will surprise you with its humor, celebration of life, and beauty. It's a book that I read through the night. Satisfying and delightful, The Lovely Bones was one of my favorite books of the year.<br /><br />Publisher: Back Bay Books; 1 Mti Rep edition (September 30, 2009), 368 pages.<br />Review copy provided by the publisher.
B00308YN2U|2.0|I bought this from Target (supposedly, it's a Target exclusive). Honestly, I just wanted the 2-disc set. I could care less about this holographic packaging. It's two heavy pieces of acrylic with a holographic sheet sandwiched in between. If you can even fit it into a DVD rack, you'll have to keep the outer plastic wrapper that holds this useless hard case packaging and the relevant DVD info (on a loose paper sheet) together. I actually feel a bit ashamed of owning this marketing travesty but it was my only option. If you have a choice, save some money and get the conventional 2-disc set.
0743437497|5.0|King's best, hand's down. Granted, I love The Stand and It, but you can't beat The Shining for pacing, mood and characterization. I just love the language in it, which is sort of an intangible. Better than the film. The only thing I hate is the cover of this \\"era\\" of King paperback re-releases. Pink and yellow don't fill me with a sense of dread, exactly.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|I just watched \\"District 9\\" on DVD, and now kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen. The production values are impressive and the lead actor (Copley) deserves to be nominated for a \\"best performance\\" award. But while the movie's premise - aliens stranded on Earth, herded into a grubby shantytown - offers grist for social commentary, the pacing is slow at the start and the story deteriorates into \\"Transformers\\" style blow-em-up action near the end. Definitely a cut or two above average, but its flaws keep it from earning five stars.
B002KGEORM|5.0|If you're looking at season 2 of SOA, then you probably loved season 1.  This is no let-down... exciting, visually and through the storyline.  Great cliff hanger season ending.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love Actually IS actually a fairly good movie. But I must debunk the ever emerging theme of movies set primarily in Europa these days....that the USA is an ogre that is about to devour the world and that the 'tiny' nation-states are for want of a better description, better than us. We see several intersecting vignettes that pique the curiosity about the microscopic characters after a mini lecture that September 11th folks trapped in the WTC all managed to send messages of Love and not Hate or Revenge while they were still able.  Each set of characters reflects that sentiment in growing ways that all impact each other, and finally--- we know that 'little Britain' is still the nation with a heart and bent for romantic and philanthropic love. The USA is counter-played as a somewhat distant second cousin--- where people come and go to Britain, get healed, get laid, get rich, and tower over the British people but are really no match.   What I must strongly comment about are the depictions of The American President (who I am sure must be a Bush-like figure) and the Texas sluts who are so stupid that they fall for an ugly uncouth delivery boy just because he is 'British.'  Tell me, folks, just where did Britain become SOOOOO racially and politically correct? It seems to me that the BIG Nations of England, Spain, France, and the Dutch did their best to keep the slave trade and its various forms of bigotry going for as long as possible. In fact, one might want to check when the various European countries outlawed slavery vs when the USA did. Spare us the lectures, folks. Just entertain.   The pairing of such heavyweights as Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman is genius. Rickman, my favorite villain of all time, is almost likable in this movie. But Emma, in her infinite indirectness, is not a shrinking violet or a victim. Both allow raw emotion to float to the top. And we watch like voyeurs. I honestly cringed when Rickman and Thompson go to bed together.  And the sub-text for thescenes in Portugal were honest and very funny, albeit slanted against the weight-challenged.  But what did grab my attention the most, being an ex-flower child, was the interplay between Billy Mack and his manager. Both knew exactly what they wanted and got there. And both, although embarrassingly honest and direct fumbled through their 'love' for each other, as only those born prior to 1960 honestly do. The tongue in cheek slap at the song \\"Love is All Around,\\" and the success that song has had through the years was the center and the crux of the movie. It really is, folks. Love IS all around. Even here in the good old USA, especially at Christmas.   Highly recommended for Christmas viewing (although there is simulated sex and nudity). It is not a rehash of 'It's a Wonderful LIfe,' 'A Christmas Story,' or a 'Christmas Carol.' But it is all about Christmas and the spirit that makes us all tick.

B001XJEKGC|5.0|I'm a drummer.  So I'll get the the few cons out of the way...<br /><br />The drummers toms had very little tone (and yes, I have a super sound system--wasn't listening through TV speakers, and I chose the DTS). They sounded like someone slapping on sacks most of the time.  Could barely hear the drummer through \\"Glad.\\"  He was playing a lot of Capaldi's licks, but they didn't come through.<br /><br />Winwood's organ sometimes drowned out his vocals but not often.  There, that's out of the way. (No one will probably get this far in the reviews anyway.)<br /><br />Wonderful concert! Everyone was on top of his instrument (the drummer was superb:  it wasn't his fault the DVD wasn't mixed properly for drums).  Loved hearing the old Blind Faith tunes.  And these guys can really play the blues!  They absolutely cooked.  Loved the Traffic song \\"No Face, No Name, No Number.\\"  Very hard song to sing.<br /><br />Would've loved to hear some more of Winwood's material, but that doesn't keep me from giving this 5 stars.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|...had it not been for the dozens upon dozens of f-bombs.  \\"It's just being realistic\\" you say?  Perhaps, but I have trouble believing the mild mannered bureaucrat at the beginning of the film would end up having trouble saying a sentence without one or more f-bombs, even with all he went through.  One here or there I can accept as realistic, but not *that* many.    As for the violence, it's not the level of violence --- which I can see as \\"realistic\\" --- but rather it being so graphical.  Was it really necessary to show every single death as it happened?    That said, the film is very, very good.  I especially liked how the friendship developed between Wikus and Christopher the alien and the alien's son.    If you can stomach the language and the violence, \\"District 9\\" is definitely worth watching.  Just take a shower afterward.
076535618X|4.0|John Perry and his ex-Special Forces wife Jane Sagan are asked by the Colonial Defense Forces to lead a new Human colony on a world that has not yet been claimed by any other alien species.  As usual, there is more than meets the eye to the CDF's request for Perry and Sagan to head the new colony -- Roanoke -- and what is not revealed may wind up costing not only Perry and Sagan their lives, but spell doom for Roanoke as well.    Once again Scalzi thrusts us into a universe where soldiers are adapted in creative ways to fight off any number of alien aggressors.  But unlike the previous two books -- Old Man's War & The Ghost Brigades -- The Last Colony focuses much less on the martial capabilities of CDF soldiers (infantry and special forces alike...after all, the previous two books convincingly displayed their skills) and focuses more on the machinations of how the CDF is dealing with the Conclave...a conglomeration of over four hundred alien species that is threatening the Colonial Union's colonization efforts.  Scalzi does a terrific job of setting the scene -- the Conclave's threat to Humanity -- but some of the details miss the mark.  I would have liked more from Sagan's perspective as well as their daughter's Zoe's perspective...though I suspect the later novel(la)s Zoe's Tale and The Sagan Diary covers much from these characters' point of view.  Still, I wanted more within this novel...I wanted Sagan and Zoe to really stand out in their interactions with others in these pages because their characters are so pivotal to this overall story.    Nonetheless, The Last Colony stands as a fine ending to a story and characters that won't soon be forgotten.  Scalzi deserves every bit of the praise he has received for this trilogy...it is more than worth reading...it is unforgettable.
B001TKK39S|5.0|I obtained this box set from Germany via Amazon Marketplace for a great deal less than the list price and after only a few samples tracks I knew I was going to love these performances. You will find collected here all Bernstein's recordings of Haydn with the New York Philharmonic, mostly recorded in (what is now called) the Avery Fisher Hall or the 30th Street Studio, plus a few other venues.<br /><br />There is a lazy and mistaken assumption about Bernstein that he invariably imposed his own indulgent, hyper-Romantic personality upon all the music he conducted. While it is perhaps true that as a conductor he did not age as well as some and that certain mannerisms became too pronounced, these recordings made between 1958 and 1975 were at the time revelatory and caused no less a Haydn authority than H.C. Robbins-Landon to dub Bernstein a great Haydn conductor - and here you can hear why. Bernstein was a great instinctive musician and while he was not always sufficiently rigorous or disciplined with his orchestras and choirs, he made them love the music they were playing and it shows. I made some fairly broad and eclectic comparisons with other celebrated interpreters like Jeffrey Tate and the ECO, Adam Fischer and the Austro-Hungarian Haydn orchestra, and period bands like La Petite Bande directed by Kuijken; time and again it was Bernstein who showed that extra feeling for Haydn's wit, charm, vigour and dash. He is not distorting Haydn, he is constantly bringing his score to life. One example would do to illustrate his superiority: the tripping waltz-rhythm of the opening movement of &#34;The Surprise&#34; is here so much more delightfully and mischievously phrased than it is by any other interpreters; everyone else sounds almost four-square. OK; one more: the opening of &#34;The Queen&#34; sounds infinitely more grand and stately under Bernstein's hands than others. Nor is Bernstein in any sense indulgent when it comes to tempi: his &#34;andante&#34; in the second movement of &#34;The Hen&#34; is an enormous three minutes faster than Fischer's yet it lives and breathes by virtue of its phrasing. Occasionally, Bernstein does get it wrong: the Menuetto of the &#34;Clock Symphony&#34; is simply too slow and plodding.<br /><br />Some contentious reviewing elsewhere engendered a lively debate regarding Bernsteins's supposed &#34;intrusiveness&#34; and also the ideal size of orchestra for Haydn. There is little doubt that the composer, like Mozart, liked a big band when he could get it and we should not assume that authenticity demands only a few valiant scrapers; Haydn would have loved to have had the NYP at his disposal. Their playing is not impeccable but their spirit and joie de vivre are. Making some small allowance for the age of these recordings, I do not find myself as critical of the sound as some others; un-remastered or not, these performances sound great on my Bose - but perhaps I was too delighted by the interpretations to care.  Not everything brings unalloyed pleasure: I think it a great pity that the &#34;Creation&#34;, featuring two such lovely interpreters in John Reardon's lean, sonorous baritone and Alexander Young's silvery, sensitive tenor, is compromised by Judith Raskin's shrill, acidic soprano; it would otherwise rank for me with Karajan's. There are many other excellent singers in the masses, however, and Bernstein's commitment is never in doubt. If you like your Haydn Masses done in the efficient style of that charmless old time-beater John Eliot Gardiner, then Bernstein's approach is not for you. Similarly, there is surely room for recordings which suit those who want &#34;period&#34; or &#34;HIP&#34; Haydn and there are recommendable recordings of this type from Mackerras and Hogwood. Perhaps a sensible compromise between the two styles is Dorati's famous, pioneering set, but it is to Lenny that I shall turn when I want to experience the full gamut of emotions contained in Haydn's work.f &#34;The Hen&#34; is an enormous three minutes faster than Fischer's yet it lives and breathes by virtue of its phrasing.

0061703257|5.0|I've read every book that Mr. Lehane has written and this is by far his best, the story takes place in 1954 Boston on an small island just outside of Massechusett's Harbor. If you are put off by books set it the past, since the book is on an ilsand you'll barely notice. Two dectectives, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule take a ferry island which is also the home of Ashcliffe Hospital, an institution for the crimanally insane, the detectives are there to find a missing prisioner named Rachel Soldano.<br /><br />This seems like a pretty typical detective story but things suddenly don't start to add up. For one, a huge hurricane like storm prevents anyone from leaving the ilsand.  Someone keeps leaving a trail of clues about the missing prisoner. During a powerful storm Teddy's partner ends up missing.  This is a true Psychological thiller, about when and when not to listen to that little voice in all are heads, this is a cat and mouse thiller, where the main character knows there's a cat but can't figure out who, and the mouse keeps chaging as well.  Sorry I'm talking in Mystery but the book will do that from page one, it just won't be as obviously.  So read this book, you will not be able to put it down.
0061914177|4.0|The only thing bad about this book is that Gary's picture is on the back inside flag. So when you're reading, and digesting the information, it is like he is watching you, questioning your DNA, and wondering how much you really want to crush it...<br /><br />In all seriousness though, its a great book from start to finish. It was really refreshing to hear Gary's back-story woven throughout what's happening now in the world of mass-market social media interaction, and to hear his glimpses on what he thinks is coming next.<br /><br />I would've dismissed it as typical \\"I'm awesome, do what I do\\" infomercial-style junk if he hadn't started off his book telling people to put their family first. He demonstrated that he eats his own dog food, all of his advice is very plausible, and it's impossible to put the book down without feeling inspired.
1594488843|5.0|Motivation is a subject on which I have spoken, published and consulted for 3 decades. Intrinsic Motivation that is and why Extrinsic motivation is so limiting and damaging to the very things a company holds most dear--especially if it is pursuing corporate responsibility. There has been so little available to stem the tide of misconstrued evidence that has filled organizations and schools with reward, recognition, incentives, and hundreds of other forms of one person seeking to motivate another- or many others. It is contrary to human nature except for our basic survival and tribal connections. We are more alive, creative and contributing when we manage our motivation by connecting with meaningful motives.<br /><br />Daniel Pink has created an unbroken string of concepts in his writing career, that come form seeing patterns that others miss. And seeing the underlying threads, with research and practices, that explain them. Motivation, his latest subject in Drive, is particularly helpful because it is intended to crush a misconception that has saturated every aspect of our lives for almost a century now. Our current view of motivation is based on the study of rats begun by John Watson (extended by BF Skinner) when he \\"formulated\\" behavioral psychology. And that is fine if you are the manger, parent, or teacher of rats. But it is not accurate if you manage, parent or teach humans in all sizes.<br /><br /> In recent decades there has been a great deal of research on humans, not rats or apes, and how motivation works with them, that supplants much of what we have been taught and deeply believe. The message is, \\"humans are more motivated by intrinsic motivation in significant pursuits. In fact, humans are de-motivated by others seeking to motivate them with money, praise or anything from the outside\\". Daniel Pink elegantly pulls this research into a compelling argument for stopping the insanity of trying to manage other's motivation.<br /><br />Section II: The Three Element of Motivation<br />Although I think there is another layer of answers to what to do to reawaken intrinsic motivation, Pink offers an excellent directional set of concepts for managing and teaching or any other situation where you have stewardship for people.<br />  * Autonomy--let people define much of their own path, people are motivated when self-directed and self-organizing<br />  * Mastery--as humans we natural aspire to Mastery and this is blocked when it is only a task without this opportunity to gain mastery<br />  * Purpose--provides the context and connects the autonomous person, who is pursuing mastery to a greater whole or objective.<br /><br />Section III: Pink in the final section, gives us a way to follow up on the ideas for ourselves and some practical suggestions on how to test the waters if your organization or family is buried in incentive programs. Some are personal, like improving your own motivation to exercise and others, a business manager can use.

B0000AK7AB|5.0|That's all I'm saying - this movie screams out for Blu-ray! It's one of my top ten movies of all time, and has been for years. That'll do.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|The movie did an excellent job of balancing the romance and poverty of Victorian London.  The special effects were phenomenal.  The lessons for Scrooge were driven home in both practical and theological ways.  I was very impressed.  The need to drive fear into Scrooge is critical to his transformation, making this inappropriate for easily frightened small children -- I did bring my 4 and 6 year old to see the movie, and it was all right, but I might not do it a second time because the effects were quite potent.  That being said, I would like to see it myself again in 3D.<br /><br />Interestingly, Scrooge does seem to do a lot of falling in the movie...<br /><br />The cinematography and effects call to mind the first Narnia (Lion/Witch/Wardrobe) rendition (Disney).  Truly, it was well done, and I highly recommend it.  I will purchase it when it comes out.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|As always, very satified with the purchase of another, DVD, from Amazon. Loved the first two movies of Ice Age, just didn't get to the theater in time to see the third. Just love the voices of the character. Thanks
B0021UDJT6|5.0|I'm a new fan of placebo, I just heard \\"for what its worth\\", bought the album (with the DVD), and became a die hard fan.  This album is rock music at its best. Sometimes you buy a record and only 2-3 songs are really good, well its absolutely not the case here. every song is amazing, and the complete album as a whole is brilliant (though not so sure about the order of the songs, but still).  you can also sense their pride and sureness about the album, which after hearing it, you'll know why.
B002R68U7K|3.0|* When I ordered a box set on Amazon I though it would be very big (because it contain 30 discs). But I was very shocked when I received it ! The box set is too small ! I couldn't believe that ! It charged me more than 70$ and I just received like this ! I want it bigger !  * The box is too small to put all of discs and a booklet into it. I am afraid if I try so hard, discs will be broken. I hate this box so much !  * Design of each single very poor. Discs are covered by hard paper and nothing in there ! However covers are very nice !   * A booklet is too poor, It's just photos from her videos ! I hoped singles would be original, but It's not ! All CDs' faces are black. Why didn't they keep original pictures !   * I love Britney and her music (she's rock!)  but this box set made me very disappointed !   * So I give this box 3 stars because of a poor design.
B002RSDW80|3.0|This movie would have been a favorite of mine if it weren't for the political jabs throughout. The acting was great and the intertwining of there lives flowed nicely, but I found the leftist slant offensive. If I wanted to see a pro-Communistic movie I would have rented one by Michael Moore.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is Sci-Fi at it's best ! I viewed this in theater and knew I had to own in when it hit the market. It's very original and not like anything I've seen before. It's political in nature, thought-provoking and the special effects were very realistic to me. The filming was beautiful and so real in nature. I'm praying Part 2 is right around the corner ! If you love Science Fiction, this is your movie.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|Orianthi, is a freakin awesome guitarist, and I do see where people come from saying that her skills are wasted on pop. This is very true. I totally agree. BUT, I like occasionally listening to Kelly Clarkson, and now I have somebody who sounds like her and has sick guitar solos.     I really hope she comes out with a CD where all she does is shred and shred and shred. Not as many people will like it, but I would.

Set me free      - Amazing film that showcases an amazingly talented and charitable human being.  I highly recommend this concert movie to anyone that grew up with or would like to discover Jackson's most famous compositions.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically. the action isn't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top. you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you don't assuming you've seen the first 3 previously
B00005JMJ4|5.0|After watching Lost In Translation I could sum it up as a film about hope. The movie felt so great at the end and it just makes you want to laugh, cry, and perhaps jump for joy.    Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star together in what I would consider one of the best movie about loneliness and hopefulness. Bill Murray played a middle aged actor who is having a midlife crisis and then happen to meet a young, beautiful woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is just starting out with life and really just don't know what lies ahead. To say the least, the two of them are fairly lonely in their trip to Tokyo and question what lies ahead. Murray is on a business trip to make money from sponsors, but he has a wife at home who pays more attention to their children than him. Johansson plays a newly wed wife who is tagging along with her husband on a business trip. She isn't sure what lies ahead in the future of the two, and she is sort of depressed and feels isolated. Together, Johansson and Murray learn something together and both at the end realizes that life has a lot more to offer than what is in a relationship.     I would say the best thing about Lost in Translation is the movie's setting. It is filmed on location in Tokyo, Japan. I never been to Japan, but I have been to Korea and I can relate to the feeling of isolation but as well as a part of the culture there. You can't understand what anyone is saying, nor can you understand the surrounding environment, and to top it off, anyone you happen to meet who speaks English can speak it very well but carrying out an actual decent conversation is next to impossible. I think Lost in Translation captured that very well.     I think what makes this movie so special is the actors who played it out. Scarlett has a very special look to her that I think fit well for this movie. She has a sort of modern beauty to her, but at the same time, you can sort of sense that she is searching for something in life. Bill Murray usually plays an arrogant, stuck up character, but his role in this movie used that to its advantage but also brought about something human in him. You can almost feel a sense of loneliness, confusion, and sort of hopelessness out of his character as he is stuck in a midlife crisis.    The movie ends in what I would consider thought provoking. [spoilers] At the end of the movie, Bill has to return home from Japan and Johansson is sort of sad to see him go, but doesn't really know what to say or how to say goodbye. So they sort of shook hands, said a quick goodbye, and parted. Still not feeling all that great, Bill is in his taxi when he sees Johansson walking amongst the crowd. He tells the driver to stop, and he walks up besides Johansson and they meet again both looking confused as to what to say. Bill then hugs Johansson, and he whispers something to her ear then parts. I think this is quite possibly the best part of the entire film. It sort of makes you wonder what Bill said to Johansson at the end, but at the same time it gives you a bit of hope and inspiration that even though you feel lonely now, and perhaps in what ever relationship you are in, that there is always hope and in that it sort of brings about your purpose, I think. [end spoilers].    With such a brilliant ending, wonderfully thought out actor and actress, and a beautiful setting, I think this movie is one of the best movies of the recent decade. At the end of the film I was feeling great about myself and each time I see this movie, I just think about it for days at a time. I say get this movie!
1416594787|4.0|Dawkins, in The Greatest Show on Earth, assembles information from the fields of physics, chemistry, geology, anatomy, genetics, and cell biology to make an airtight case for evolution. This is not Dawkins' first attempt to drive the last nail into the coffin of doubters, nor is it necessarily his best, but it is probably his most thorough. With bone-crunching force, Dawkins walks the reader through a summation of what we know from geology (the evidence that Earth is 4.5 billion years old), genetics, contemporary biology (multiple examples of evolution that have been observed to have happened over the course of one or two generations), the fossil record (always fun reading!), physics (the accuracy of the techniques used for dating the age of events and fossils), and much, much more.<br /><br />The strength of The Greatest Show on Earth is its demonstration that the theory of evolution is no more \\"theoretical\\" than atomic theory, or the theory that our solar system is (thanks, Copernicus!) heliocentric. It would be safer to bet that the sun won't come up tomorrow, argues Dawkins, than to doubt that the myriad forms of life on earth are the result of the tri-part action of heritability, genetic variability, and natural selection. To knock down evolution, one of those pillars would have to crumble. If you believe that traits are passed on from parent organism to offspring, and if you believe that mutations occur regularly in genetic material, and if you believe that nature will select out the mutations that favor survival, then you believe in evolution, Dawkins would say. Tough to argue with that stance, unless you resort to what Hawkins calls \\"argumentum consequentiam\\", i.e. you reject the argument because you don't like the consequences of it being true, rather than because it has lack of merit.<br /><br />The weakness of the book is that Dawkins often behaves like an NBA or hockey player that has just been in a brawl on court/rink: with his teammates dragging him away so that the game can resume, he keeps trying to break loose to take one more punch, just ONE MORE PUNCH, at his opponents (the creationists/intelligent design advocates). It's not that I don't share Dawkins frustrations with the intelligent design folk. I'm a family physician, and the notion that the human body was designed by something or someone with even mediocre intelligence is way, WAY into LOL territory. From the top of our heads (hair) to the tip of our toes (toenails), our bodies are loaded with features (try goosebumps!) that make no sense whatsoever for human function, but make perfect sense as the detritus of an evolutionary process. That said, Godawmighty, Dawkins, let the science speak for itself. If a person has ears to hear, the science will speak to him/her. If a reader does not have ears to hear, and has adopted religious/supernatural beliefs that lead to loud cognitive dissonance with the concept of a singularity (the Big Bang) leading without unnatural assistance into the world that we see around us, little in The Greatest Show on Earth is likely to cause a conversion to a belief system based on verifiable and reproducible knowledge.<br /><br />At its best, The Greatest Show on Earth is an excellent, in depth, remarkably thorough recounting of the prolific evidence that has built upon and corroborated the revolution started with Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In its lesser moments, the book is a brawl with those who cannot conceive of a world in which the hand of God did not wave a wand over nature's orchestra, and consequently must renounce all findings that threaten this view.<br /><br />There is a sadness in this ongoing conflict between scientists and creationist/intelligent design advocates, and there are people of good will on both sides. I have a patient that is a retired high school science teacher. His hobby and his passion was geology. The last time that I saw him, he let me know that he no longer pursues his fascination with geology, because the scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old was beginning to overwhelm his belief that the Bible is literally true. \\"I had to make a choice\\" my patient said, \\"and I chose the Bible\\". I dream of a world in which we inquire vigorously after the truths of the natural world, have the courage to go where that inquiry takes us, and in the end, revel in the sense of awe and wonder that results.evidence that the Earth is billions of years old was beginning to overwhelm his belief that the Bible is literally true. \\"I had to make a choice\\" my patient said, \\"and I chose the Bible\\".

B001H5X7I4|5.0|Tropic Thunder brings to the screen the story of five actors shooting a Vietnam-era Vietnam-themed movie in Vietnam. What starts off as a routine shooting in the rice patties and Jungles of S.E. Asia, turns out to be a nightmare (albeit a funny one) for a group of five clueless actors.   Don't look for the movie to make much sense; it doesn't and it's not supposed to, but it's so darn funny it will have you in tears (literally) on more than a few occasions.  Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte, Tom Cruise, and the rest of this AMAZING cast carry out their performances very well. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, the humor (!!!), and the music are all very good.   In a nutshell, though it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, it will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment. 4.5 Stars
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Welcome to the world of Carl, a crotchety old widower whose life passed by before he got the chance to do so many things he wanted to with his beloved wife, Ellie. And Russell, a young, deeply lonely kid desperately seeking affection and support from a world of adults that never seem to have time for him.    Up! is about love and loss, aging and growing up, loneliness and missed opportunities. There are definitely some aspects of the movie that don't contribute as much as others, and I'm not sure how well it really plays to children as opposed to adults, but two montages in particular were hauntingly powerful for me. I and people I love certainly teared up in certain parts. Yet it's far from depressing, to my mind. It reaffirms that life with people you love--however quiet and unassuming and (sometimes) full of sacrifices--is the ultimate adventure, whether or not it turned out exactly as you might have dreamed. That meaning, and ultimately happiness, in life comes from caring and extending oneself for others, at any age. That older people have an incredible amount to offer, even if they can't do everything they might wish to. That bonds of affection and trust between generations can be strengthening and healing to both. That life doesn't have to end with death or abandonment or old age, so long as you can open yourself up to loving and serving others.    For that alone, I think this movie was valuable.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Whether you have followed the lovely and super talented Norah Jones from her debut album, picked up on her music later or are contemplating this as your first look into her music, you will find that she will pull you into her music world rather easily.  'Fall' is a bit different from her earlier CD's as she is using a more pop motivated delivery than her more jazz-oriented influences as we have seen in the past. It's all good! Her vocals are strong and the lyrics meaningful and heart-felt. Lot's of introspect here. My personal favorites on this CD is the 1st selection 'Chasing Pirates' and the 4th, 'Young Blood', a real rockish tune with a steady, driving beat. Either is a 'top 10' quality tune. The lyrics on both are absolutely terrific and I am quickly latching onto other tunes like 'December', 'It's Gonna Be' and 'You've Ruined Me' with each play of this CD, which is frequent.   Buy it! Enjoy it! If she hasn't already, Norah will sing her way into your heart!
0688014291|2.0|\\"The One Minute Manager\\" purports to give the reader instructions on managing work and life. It does that, but the advise is so obvious and the instruction so superficial as to make reading even this short volume a waste of time.    The advice is to give employees clear instructions, then praise them when they do well, and reprimand them when they do not. That is nearly the whole book. Now you don't have to read it.    While this advise seems correct to me, it is also very obvious. I would think that any manager who does not already know this needs more help then this book can provide.    In any case the book can not do much harm since it is short.

B00268EVL8|5.0|Shantaram is long. Really long. But there's no human emotion not covered in its pages, no experience not touched upon. It's truly an epic journey in every sense.<br /><br />Shantaram is a novel that is rumored to be autobiographical, though who can blame any memoirist for labeling his book a novel after the James Frey affair? It is brutally violent, profane, hilarious, touching, and riveting for almost 1000 pages. I chew up books at a ridiculous rate, but this one kept me in its spell for almost three weeks. I couldn't wait to finish it; I hated for it to end.<br /><br />I have read several other books since finishing this one, but I haven't been able to tackle a serious work since I read this one. I felt I had to recover a little, that Shantaram both filled me up and wore me out. Now I'm on the hunt for the next great novel.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|Bill Murray, looking old and wasted, plays Bob Harris, a film actor who has come to Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is very appealing as Charlotte, the neglected young wife of a photographer. The other star in this film is the city of Tokyo, whose surreal glitz pulses throughout the film and provides a thematic undercurrent.     It is their alienation from this unreal foreign world that brings Murray and Johansson together in a friendship that approaches romance and ends in sad inevitability when the waning actor leaves Tokyo to return to his own deflated marriage, leaving Johansson to await the return of her insensitive, self-absorbed, preoccupied husband. A leitmotif is the two characters' feelings of emotional estrangement. They are \\"lost\\" not only because of language and culture barriers but in a deeper sense, their disillusionment with lives that seem to lack the richness they'd expected.     The story is rather thin and the dialogue less than crackles. Charlotte doesn't get very many good lines and has to compensate with a good range of facial expression. Bill Murray's character tries to wax philosophical but it sounds clichéd, as when he tells Charlotte that once you have children \\"Your life is never the same again.\\" Charlotte agonizes over her lack of direction: she tried writing but her self-evaluation of her work was that it was terrible (Harris later tells her somberly that she should keep writing).    But director Sofia Coppola makes the most of the materials at hand, and this is a good film in spite of its defects. Murray and Johansson's performances overcome a weak script, and the vignettes of life in Tokyo capture the spirit of a city that one writer has compared to Disneyland.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this film so was very disappointed when it would not play as it was the 'wrong region'!  I had to send it back to the USA and am waiting for a refund from Amazon.  I would have liked to have been warned about this prior to purchasing.  I will be very wary about ordering dvd's from Amazon in the future.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|The excitement had been building for a couple of days. Finally the day had come. We were going to see the Imax 3D Avatar experience on the opening day for the 11:30 matinee.  We piled in the car and drove the 20 plus miles into town to the downtown IMAX theater. We got our popcorn and drinks and picked up our 3D glasses. Entering the screen room, we were pleasntly surprised to find good seats right in the middle about half way up. Everyone was chattering away and I could feel the anticipation in the air. We enjoyed the previews for upcoming movies, especially the 3D preview for the upcoming Alice in Wonderland, with the Cheshire Cat floating in front of your nose.     Then the movie started and we sat mesmerized, no....stunned is a better word, right up to the very end. I have two words to describe this movie: Absolutely Astounding! James Cameron out did himself with this movie. The color, the effects, the acting were superb. There are a lot of big special effects movies these days and for most of them, that's the most you can say. But like all of Cameron's films, this one has a great story. The actors are so convincing in their roles that you become involved in their lives. When a movie can elicit deep emotions from the audience like anger, concern, sadness, and joy for the characters then it can only be regarded as a great film. I thought Segourney Weaver did an outstanding job, as always, playing the gruff Dr. Grace Augustine. I liked the way her personality shifts, when she is in her avatar Na'vi body, to the sweet and concerned teacher of children. And I can't say enough about the performance of Zoe Saldana, unknown to me before this movie, for her portrayal of the Na'vi \\"princess\\" Neytiri. The passion, expression, and emotion she puts into this role makes her alien character totally believable.     I will not talk about the plot for this movie because I don't like revealing spoilers. Suffice it to say that if you choose not to see this movie, especially in 3Dand if possible in IMAX, then you will be missing a singularly unique experience you may never get another chance at. I doubt that any 3D DVD or blu-ray version that comes out could possibly do this film justice. Recall the dismal failures for the Polar Express and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Now, after writing this review, I realize I have to go and see it again. I know my kids will want to.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Now come on now this movie is not bad I mean who knows what the future might be like if there was something like that with all those advanced Technology. And looking at this movie takes me out of my world and puts me into this interesting fictional world. I liked the movie aeon Flux but I like ultraviolet more. I mean the way she fought was awesome.
B00012QLQ4|1.0|For years I'd heard all kinds of accolades heaped on this film, running the gamut of \\"greatest anime ever made\\" to \\"film that changed everything.\\" So before I even watched it, I sat down and read all 6 volumes of the original manga from cover to cover, starting from the opening sequence of Tokyo being blown up in Volume 1 to the very last scene of Volume 6.<br /><br />And boy, am I glad I did, because this is probably one of the most brilliantly written and visually compelling graphic novels ever created. I know that sounds totally \\"fanboy\\", but I don't mean to be. The manga truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. That's not to say it's not without flaws, but that it's as close as you can get to perfection.<br /><br />So imagine my shock when I finally saw this film, the so-called \\"best anime ever made\\", the one so many anime fans have been raving about. As I watched this film, I didn't feel awe and amazement, but something decidedly different-- the sense that this was probably one of the WORST adaptations of a literary work ever in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Many people have defended the poor adaptation with the excuse that \\"there wasn't enough time to put everything from the book into the movie.\\" But this is a straw man. The anime is not poorly adapted because it didn't cram everything from the manga into the movie. It's poorly adapted, because Otomo himself changed his original story so dramatically that it doesn't even come close to resembling the manga in any real sense. It's almost as if the screenplay had been adapted by someone who'd never read Akira a day in his life.<br /><br />If you think I'm exaggerating, here are some very specific examples of how badly Otomo eviscerated his own work in adapting it to screen:<br /><br />1) A majority of the events in this film never happened in the manga, and very few of the events in the manga occur in the film. Of the few incidents from the manga included in the film, they happen in a completely different context than in the manga.<br /><br />2) Characters who died tragically in the book either live in the movie or die in a completely different way than they did in the manga, usually in a manner that is far less dramatic or moving<br /><br />3) Kaori, the street urchin who Tetsuo's henchman randomly picked off the streets to be his slave, is his girlfriend in the movie<br /><br />4) Kiyoko, Masaru, and Takahashi are vicious brats who aggressively attack Tetsuo, when it was Tetsuo who was the aggressor<br /><br />5) Chiyoko doesn't exist, and neither do any of the characters associated with Miyako or Akira's \\"kingdom\\" after the destruction of Neo-Tokyo. Nezu, Ryu and other side characters are just thrown in for the hell of it. The scientists in Volume 6 don't exist, and the cigarette fiend makes a small cameo.<br /><br />6) Remember how much the drugs were a part of the story? They don't figure here at all, except, once again, as a mere cameo (Kaneda wears a pill on his jacket; Tetsuo tries to score drugs off a barkeep)<br /><br />The most egregious cases in which Otomo dramatically altered his story:<br /><br />1) He decided he wanted to make \\"Kiyoko\\" the \\"wise sage\\" in the movie, so he destroyed Lady Miyako's character. In the book, she was the philosophical heart of the story, a central figure very similar to the Oracle character in the Matrix. In the movie, she's transformed from wise and caring sage to crazed lunatic ranting that Neo-Tokyo needs to \\"burn\\" to be purified. So whereas in the book she was a protector of people and wise sage, in the movie she's a religious nut who wants them to burn in a \\"rapture-like\\" blaze. To add insult to injury, she's given a man's voice to make her seem more crazy, and she's casually killed off along with some anonymous city rabble after two brief cameos that couldn't have lasted more than 20 seconds each.<br /><br />2) And Akira? I'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you see what \\"Akira\\" is in this movie, you'll literally shake your head wondering what in the hell Otomo was thinking. The change defies logic, because in changing him so radically he essentially rewrote his own story beyond recognizability.<br /><br />All of these dramatic changes would be forgivable if this new version of Akira was entertaining and well written in its own right. Unfortunately, I can't say that it is. I found it painfully boring and convoluted. Not only was the pace plodding, the screenplay was muddled to the point where even I-- who'd read the story-- had trouble following what was going on. So it definitely wasn't a compelling movie for me.<br /><br />I know I'm gonna tick off a lot of hardcore fans of this movie, but I'm sorry-- as a huge fan of the manga, it's impossible for me to consider it as \\"the best ever\\" when it did such a terrible job of adapting the original story to screen. Watch it for the animation if you will, or the nostalgia of having viewed this \\"revolutionary anime\\" from when it first came out, or out of curiosity to see what the fuss is all about. But if you're a fan of the manga, I would seriously pass. It's definitely not the adaptation you hoped and dreamed for; if anything, it's the stuff that nightmares are made of.e in changing him so radically he essentially rewrote his own story beyond recognizability.

1595141715|2.0|I picked this up after my 16 year old niece raved about this book. It was required reading for her AP English course. While the premise is original, the writing style irked me. From the beginning the protagonist describes his actions in unnecessary detail. For example, \\"I take the package into the kitchen...set it on the counter...slide open the junk drawer...pull out a pair of scissors...run a scissor blad around the package and lift off its top.\\"  I also found it very distracting that the excerpts of the girls' tape-recorded voice was frequently interrupted by the protagonist's thoughts. I understand that the reader needs to know what he is thinking, but the author jumped back and forth between the two so frequently that it gave the story a choppy feel. For what they are worth, those are my two cents.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This was actually a great, entertaining movie that I could watch over again. The story was a little weird at first but it seems to be like a \\"Kill Bill\\" style of movie making. I guess because of the effects and what not? Lots of realistic gore and the plot was good. I enjoyed this movie, plus Amazon sells this for a cheaper price than walmart!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much so. It was very well done and granted a little out there for some people I encourage those wanting to go see it to do so. Also for your information I do intend on purchasing it when it comes out if you had doubts beforehand.
0812973992|2.0|One of the most highly-admired, disappointments of my literary life.  Perhaps, just perhaps, if you are a life-long New Yorker, and enjoy the despondency and desperation of that city, you may be able to tolerate this work.  The author is talented, his descriptive analysis of events and people is extraordinary, but his outlook is jaded and seriously mean.    I read a book a week and this one made for a very depressing week.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the series both on screen and on DVD, but when they remastered the original Star Wars movies into a set like the Star Wars Prequel set it was only available in the widescreen format. I have since gotten all the movies in the entire trilogy on full screen but I had to buy them one at a time which was more expensive then buying them as shown in the new box sets. So If they do become available remastered in full screen format box set I might buy them as a set.
0439023491|5.0|The best books I have read this year are the Hunger Games and the second book, Catching Fire.  This continues<br />Katniss's story and it is riveting!  Make sure and read the Hunger Games first!  Suzanne Collins is a genius!<br />I can't wait until the 3rd book in this trilogy comes out this summer! Mrs. Collins writing is flawless!
B002T9H2L0|3.0|It finally hit me while watching Basterds that QT is a complete and utter sadist. The best performance here is the film's main sadist, whom the director clearly identifies with to a large degree. QT delights as usual in showing extreme violence in great detail. Someone please tell me how Aldo Raine calmly eating his lunch while watching a man be beat to death with a baseball bat is in any way not as reprehensible as any Nazi killing. Please. The Nazis had their own self-justifications, too. Torture is torture, whoever's doing it.<br /><br />It's that kind of juvenile delight in others' pain that makes Tarantino happy. It's in almost every film he's done, with the exception of Jackie Brown, which along with Pulp is the only thing he's done that moved me intelligently. You can almost hear him salivating behind the camera as the sick stuff pulled from his warped sense of justice plays out on the screen. How is that masterful? Coppola is masterful; watch how the Godfather's violence plays out, then watch a QT film. That's the difference between art and psychosis, to my eyes.<br /><br />I'm sure the fanboys will dump all over this opinion, but then again, look at the folks who worship QT...and worship is the right word. The ones I see here in Austin, and there are plenty, seem to be just like their hero: the kind of guy who got beaten up in high school and gets revenge in delighting in others' suffering, real or cinematic. I saw the first few QT film fests he did here, and while his pre-screening talks were often interesting (and painfully hyper-speed; sniff sniff, hello Peru!), there was also a sense of a guy who thinks film is reality and that the rest of life is just prelude to the lights going down. Perhaps that's why he can't see how sadistic his own vision is.<br /><br />He found his perfect subject here, for who can complain about revenge on the Nazis? Yet it all feels to me no less disgusting than what the Germans were up to. Listen to Raine's first speech; that's promotion of genocide, pretty much. And the graphic displays of scalps being cut off? Come on, what exactly is the point of that except delight in other's suffering? Hate begets hate, and any truly mature filmmaker seeks redemption not in revenge, but in understanding and transcendence. Or, maybe I'm just wrong and it's all about an eye for an eye. Make them all suffer! In hi-def, with lots of blood and screaming! Yay team!!<br /><br />Yes, Quentin is a technically fine director, and the opening scene is good (though hardly the revelation many claim; there are plenty of war films with many more gripping scenes than that). But the whole Raines subplot is entirely unnecessary here, and seems to exist only to let QT and his fanboys delight in onscreen torture, supposedly justified by the other side's own atrocities. The main story is much more interesting, and if it alone had been the whole movie, it would be a much finer work. But Tarantino needs to torture people. He lives for it. And that's sadism, pure and simple.<br /><br />I did very much enjoy the performances of Waltz and Laurent, and the main story is decent enough (if totally unbelievable; Hitler brings all his top guys to a little theatre in France with almost no security outside? Sure.). But add that pointless subplot and the film becomes over two and half hours long, and that felt about 45 minutes too long to me. Take out the gleeful violence and suddenly it makes sense. But I guess that's not what Quentin's audience signs up for; they love the blood and gore and he's more than happy to deliver.<br /><br />He's got the skills, sure, but for my money he needs to dump the incessant violence and focus on character and plot development instead of seeing how many graphic killings he can insert into every film.pretty much.

B001K98MFU|3.0|I was really excited to see the English voice actors come back and do voice work. Problem is the English dialogue is unbalanced and incredibly loud while the great sound FX in the movie are muffled terribly. Luckily the Japanese track sounds great. If I had known the english track was so bad, I would have stayed with the DVD.
0756405890|4.0|The story is fun to read and well written.  This is the first book in a series of books (maybe a trilogy) and I am interested to read the following books.  However, the book needs to have an ending of its own, especially since the book is 660 pages long (hardcover edition).  It seemed like the rest of the last chapter was missing when I reached the end of the book.  I hope the next book has an actual ending.  Even without an actual ending, the book is well worth a read.    The characterizations in the book are excellent and make the characters come to life.  The level of description of the scenery/events is good to allow readers to picture the scene, but not so much as to get in the way of the story.
0547258305|5.0|This is simply an intensely engaging read! Please note that it's not just for young adults...People of all ages will enjoy reading this book! It's a fantasy that's set in an alternate universe (comparable to our middle ages). If you enjoy reading about strong, female protagonists who overcome adversity to become heros... then this is the book for you! Great character developments throughout the book! I hope the author comes out with a sequel...this book and its characters are that good!
B0029O08WA|5.0|I loved this movie and also loved this CD!  The words in many of the songs  mirror what is happening in the movie.  Bella is depressed through most of the movie  because of Edward leaving, and the songs reflect this. However, they are beautiful  and poignant with the melodies and words. I LOVE IT!
B0026P3G12|5.0|DISCLAIMER: I didn't buy this album to critique its production or technical merit.     BUT RATHER...I, like many others, bought \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" after being touched by Susan's story and admiring her powerful vocals. This album is a million times better than the overly auto-tuned/synthesized trash put out by other artists who can't even sing. Susan's voice is pure, the songs are entertaining and each has a real meaning to the artist.     Most importantly, each track makes me feel something;  isn't that what an album is supposed to do?     Am I a zombie consumer that does everything the post-American Idol music industry tells me to? Am I just another consumer tricked by Simon Cowell into buying this album so that he can profit off of it much more than Boyle ever will? No.    I'm just happy to listen to some good music. I bought two copies of this CD for myself and will probably buy some more for my friends and relatives. If any product ever truly deserved 5 stars, this would be it (simply because buying it means something to me and millions of others). Great job, Susan.
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins' new book is a return to 'natural history' and evolution's wonders.  What distinguishes this book from his earlier works -- all of which are incredible reads -- prior to The God Delusion, is that it follows a path from the simplest of changes in living organisms to the large-scale changes that characterize evolution over time.  The journey invites the reader along with the scientist, visiting vistas where the evidence for evolution is apparent and convincing.  Dawkins succeeds wonderfully in leading the patient reader along from one example to the next, until the full scope of the scale of evolutionary change and the reality of evolution as the best -- and only currently viable -- explanation for \\"how we got here\\" is revealed.<br /><br />I would argue that this is NOT an anti-religious book; if it were, I might be writing a very different review.  This is an anti-creationist, pro-science apologetic; in the classic sense of that word.  Early in the text Dawkins talks about how he has co-signed letters with Christian bishops urging that evolution is a fact, standing against the infiltration of our schools by creationists.  While he himself is an atheist, he is not the enemy of intelligent, open-minded religion as such -- even though he disagrees with it's tenets in very strong terms.  I would encourage anyone who is religious and who is not a creationist to read this book, and wonder at the universe and at life and how life has actually come into existence; how it has evolved over time.  The only kind of religion that is threatened by this book is that of the creationists and fundamentalists; as Dawkins calls them -- the \\"history deniers.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins' prose is clear and yet poetic; there is an aesthetic enjoyment to reading any of Dawkins' books on evolutionary biology, and his use of metaphor and simile is always engaging and rewarding.  When he makes a point about how the evidence he is presenting will 'annoy' creationists and other history deniers--he is not being mean, but simply affirming that the evidence for evolution is so strong that someone of the creationist ilk must necessarily be made 'uncomfortable.'  I do not find this book full of vitriolic rhetoric! (Not in the least!).  It is a beautiful journey through the evidence for the fact of evolution. I would invite all genuinely religious people to read, understand and embrace this book, come to terms with evolution, and proclaim its truth against the 'history deniers.'mean, but simply affirming that the evidence for evolution is so strong that someone of the creationist ilk must necessarily be made 'uncomfortable.'

B0030CIAQQ|5.0|I just saw Sherlock Holmes this afternoon and the minute the movie started, I was instantly hooked. I've never read a Sherlock Holmes story and knew right away that this wasn't going to be the traditional take on this legendary character mainly because of casting, directing and of course, the music. I'll leave my review of the film on another website, suffice to say that I liked it a lot.<br /><br />The music however also piqued my interest. It was jarring and eccentric at times but I gradually fell in love with it, especially the opening score. For the entire movie I kept wondering \\"who the heck composed this score?!\\" I stayed at the end to see the credits (only time they came up) and a smile crept on my face when I saw who it was.<br /><br />This score is TOTALLY different than anything else he has done before. I hate it when composers start to rehash previous scores together due to utter laziness or from being uninspired. This soundtrack is so far left field for Zimmer that it made it unique and refreshing in my opinion. This is his best work since Gladiator.<br /><br />The first reviewer (Jon Broxton) gave a very detailed analysis of the music and he was right on point so go ahead and read that intelligent review. From a person who simply loves Hans Zimmer's work through the years, all I will say is that I love this album and if you're a fan as well, go ahead and buy it!

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is the best kept secret on TV.     This is a show that results in sensory overload. It is a look back to a time in our nation's history that is both melancholy and reprehensible at the same time.  It shows that the 50's and early 60's weren't as simple as those of us old enough tend to wax about. To the contrary it was a time when everyone smoked, men wore hats, women lived in corsets and girdles, and alcohol was consumed as if it was water.    Ye t it was also a time of change. A period when minorities were just beginning to be treated as \\"real humans\\" and women were trying to be viewed as equals. The show is dark, quiet and smooth....seamless. The characters are well thought out and each has their own complex and intriguing plot. A must see.
B000LXHK2C|1.0|This would be characterized as a guilty pleasure movie, because it is innocent and pretty in its all-too-ditsy story line. After all, Crowe's superficial charm winning over the smart, sexy, unobtainable woman was not really grounded in any convincing moves or even modification in his demeanor. No greater truth was reached. The plot revolving around the girl who was supposedly heiress to the land was irritating, and again no knowledge was gained (beyond all doubt, at least) before the resolution is reached. So, I look at it as that, a simple movie to watch when one doesn't feel like thinking. As such, there is a single moment I considered mildly entertaining, which was the expulsion of the Americans from the restaurant after they verbally defiled the menu... yes, Americans are slobs without any appreciation for the sublime... that's been established. But this film is far from sublime, so there is no room for critique.
