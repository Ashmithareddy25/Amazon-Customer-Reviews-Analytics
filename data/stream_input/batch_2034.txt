0446573027|3.0|I was looking for a hard bound book ... received a paperback. Love the author. Text was a good read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a fun app I play it everyday. I would recommend it. I also have it on my cell phone.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Love the options and sounds. I prefer waking up to sound effects instead of an alarm. Great for traveling or vacation.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was the same brand of humor as the family guy series which I love. It's just that you can almost predict the crass jokes even though they're often hilarious and cringeworthy (sub Brian the dog for ted the bear and you get the idea). That being said it was good mindless entertainment.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie first and felt the need to read the book to get the full effect. While some minor details were changed, the book is just as heartwarming if not more so than the movie. Definitely worth reading.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|This product is adequate for cropping photos, and it is convenient with the simple slide controls on each function.<br />If you want to do extensive editing, go to heavier duty photo editors.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Second book I have read by this author. I literally felt all of the emotions of the characters. Well written, definitely a re-read. I cried and my heart broke. Would recommend to anyone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome and a great sequel to the first and has great graphics and new things. it is more addicting than the first.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used Yahoo mail for many years ... very dependable mail service ... simple to use ... recommend it to others
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|decent graphics.fun tasks. time management stresses are at reasonable level. enjoyable for people who play games for brain plasticity benefits.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The Martian was an impulse buy based on recommendations from Amazon from my prior reading. I enjoy survival, dystopian futures, and sci-fi, and this had two of the three elements. I won't bother with the basic premise as that should be clear to you but I will discuss what's poor and what's great about this book.<br /><br />Poor:<br />-The main character is very shallow and any sort of development is really lacking. He's a really immature child stuck in the body of a super-genius astronaut/botanist/engineer. I would have loved to have more background on him as well as possibly giving him more onus to live such as communication with family or a loved one. The character can be very funny at times but by the end of the book I was starting to get annoyed.<br />-While I enjoyed a lot of the science, the details go a bit too far at a few points so my eyes would gloss over and I would skim.<br />-Several of the subplots don't go anywhere. There is a small section involving the Chinese that leaves a lot of questions that are never answered. A few of the characters piqued my interest but nothing ever really developed beyond basic caricatures.<br />-The ending was pretty good, but the actual END of the book sucked. Would have loved to read an epilogue of some sort but that would have betrayed the super shallow immature main character.<br /><br />Great:<br />-Plausible plotline and believable (at least for a non-scientist) technology and scenarios lends a lot of credence to an outrageous story.<br />-A lot of the humor is quite funny and hits the mark. The Iron Man joke had me laughing out loud.<br />-The interplay between the various parties did a great job of building intrigue and tension and taking pressure off the tediousness of daily Mars routines.<br />-The various solutions that the main character comes up with to survive his situation are very creative and had a great MacGyver feel to them, except perhaps more \\"realistic.\\"<br /><br />Overall, that final \\"Great\\" is whatcarried the book for me. I really enjoyed the creative ways in which the author combines engineering, science, humor, and Geek culture to carry us through a survival story on Mars. While this wasn't exactly high literature, it was not low-brow either. If you combined Popular Mechanics and Mad magazine you might arrive at a general idea of the feel that this book has. I recommend it and wish the author the best in his future projects.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful stories I have read - genuine and heartfelt, asking real questions and inspiring the reader to do so as well.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I wasn't a fantasy gamer but this game makes it fun. I'm blasting chumeres and goblins and ogres like a baws. very very good game. so glad its free. gonna play this for a very long time 5/5<br />fun : 5/5<br />story: duzn't really hav one<br />multiplayer: u can always count on others to help u thru a level online if its too hard alone

B001DUKHXQ|3.0|I ordered &#34;Thriller&#34; on vinyl direct from Amazon. The disc is a pretty wobbly press that skipped on &#34;Billie Jean&#34; right out of the sleeve. The sleeve it came in was broken, and doesn't hold the disc properly.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in Amazon's ability to deliver a vinyl disc. I'll give them another chance though.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Purchased this movie as a present on Christmas for my wife and she loved it.  This is one of her favorite movies and it looks great in Blu-Ray.  Definitely a funny movie for all ages and something you can watch more than once without being bored.  Great for the kids, adults and the whole family.
0071766588|5.0|this is a good book. this book have some parts, such as reading, listening, speaking ang writind. Also, they give some skills
B008XG1X18|5.0|What did we do before Pinterest? I know one thing, we paid too much for everything that we could have made ourselves!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|If only everything could be bought with in game cash I would give it 5 full stars and this would be the perfect game . Truly it  is really fun
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It's ok to rent, glad I didn't pay to see it at theater.  Jennifer Lawrence was much better in Hunger Games.
B004XGN8W4|2.0|I ordered mine used admittedly, however, half the screen is all that works with my xbox slim. It took me a long time to get it as I'm currently deployed, so to have it returned within the 30 days is next to impossible. Luckily I was able to sell it to a buddy whom it just happened to work fine for with his PS3. If you're going to use it for travel or a deployment make sure it works before you're in an area you can't really return via mail efficiently. Good idea overall, but I think I'll look into building my own box out of a pelican case...
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is very fun, but some achievements are hard to reach due to an excessive cost. It takes forever to gain adequate funds, but it is rewarded.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Easy read with lots of insight and new information about the players. You'd think Ms Goodwin was there and knew these people firsthand
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book of the hunger games left me wanting more. It seemed to have been just written really quickly to get done with it. It was hard to follow. This author could have done a lot better job if she had put as much effort into it as the first 2  books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first but this was sooooo much better. Best book I've ever read. Catching Fire here I come
1616960922|5.0|This book reads really quick. It's a perfect little piece of Kindle reading. The characters are well drawn out, but it could use a little subtlety. It seems like Brandon has a lot to say and he wants to say all of it in only a couple hundred pages. As a result, it ends up being a little preachy. Regardless, it is an excellent read, especially when you read it as a commentary on Sanderson overtaking Jordan's project. Much like Shai needs to bring the emperor back to life, Brandon needs to revive and finish the Wheel of Time. And there are doubters who believe that he does is blasphemous, but in the end he makes a wonderful work of art.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this is the best modern combat game ever the graphics are awesome and that story is really neat and the multiplayer rocks.
B003O86FMW|4.0|would recommend to a friend.  At times the book was so fast paced that you would think of things the author left out and wondered what the characters of the hunger games did at certain times. I am sure others know what I mean when I say this. It was a good book though. It was not as good as the first book. The first book gave better description of what was happening and why. The second book left some of that lacking.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|This book seems to be written for people without enjoyment for well-crafted prose. It's horrible and reads as if Cline had a checklist of 80s pop references which he was diligently trying to complete.<br /><br />Additionally, the Kindle book has several places where whole sentences, possibly even paragraphs, were dropped.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|More people like this please.  Humble, brilliant, hard-working, loyal to family and friends.  Talented, gifted, serene.<br /><br />Fantastic movie.  Great people in South Africa too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this book series can't wait for the third book! Bring it on we need more Cross!!!! Hot hot hot!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Jennifer Lawrence, though quite good in other movies, such as the X-Men series, is lame in this completely unconvincing adaptation of the popular kids book, &#34;The Hunger Games.&#34; The book itself was, while geared to teenagers (or tweens), was entertaining enough to keep readers' attention and plausible, though a bit heavy handed with the allegory.<br /><br />This movie version drops all the subtleties and just proceeds with the action, and that action is stilted and unbelievable. Woody Harrelson does a credible job, though his character has changed from the book version, and other characters are barely developed. Everyone knows the story from the beginning and knows Catniss will prevail, so there's little drama, and her cohort is horribly miscast. Even the usually capable Lawrence doesn't quite seem how to play the role she has been cast in, and the result is a mishmash of action and internal angst that is poorly portrayed.<br /><br />The script is terrible, the story has been stripped of human interest, and the allegory is unbelievable. Despite all the hype, this is not a worthwhile movie.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|No!!!!!!! NEED the house of Hades!!!! Why????; Why??????? I Hate cliff hangars!!!!! Why did it a have to end?!? I'm so sad!!!!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|We normally watch this movie every year while we decorate the Christmas tree. Puts you in the Christmas spirit. At least for us it does. Typical Chevy Chase stupidity. If you like Chevy Chase, you will like this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read this book 3 times each time it just gets better and better! I love the second book as well can't wait for the third to come out!

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is one of those albums that grabs you...on first listen.  Every song is vibrant, in different ways.  I listened to it three times in a row...just to try and capture the essence of it all.  IMHO, this is a GREAT pop record...the more I listen to Bruno, the more it makes me think he's a Hawaiian Michael Jackson.  He writes, sings, dances...he can do it all, and with style, grace & verve. I haven't been this excited about a pop performer in many years.  Bruno explodes, whether on record or better yet live. And I think he's just scratching the surface.  Buy or download this album and you'll see what I mean.
0375714839|4.0|I originally read this graphic novel as part of one of my college English courses. It isn't the best in terms of writing style, probably because of the comic book form, It's not lyrical at all. On the contrary, I would say it's a little top blunt and straightforward, if your looking for a novel with more poetic prose. But, this style makes for quite easy and fast reading, so I would say that the lack of lyricism doesn't really detract from the novel as all. I think the pictures within the individual panels are great, and there are some marvelous opportunities for analysis of the pictures, if you're in to that kind of thing. Interesting plot, and one of my favorite graphic novels. It's a fun read.
B0015XHQTY|5.0|Arrived on time and a great movie. If you like classic movies this is one for your collection a must have...
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game alot. It is a little no brainer that I can playwhen I just need to pass time. Doctor's office ,etc..............
0765325950|5.0|Picking up the series was a difficult task and i applaud Sanderson for his work cleaning up Jordan's mess. Happy its over and I am happy with the ending
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest books I will ever read. And this is coming from a 5th grade boy. I love classics, and have read books like Treasure Island and A Christmas Carol. But this may just be the best of the three.<br />Now I want to say specifically to Pete, yah, you know who I'm talking about, that how the heck could you say this book is bad? IT'S AWESOME! And then I want to say to aaman or whatever your name is, come on. Really? Did you have to write TWO reviews on how bad this book was? No. And then there was someone else who said they tried to read it twice with their mom, but hated it. Anyway, I'm on very low battery, so I need to go. Good-bye.
B008J05EL8|5.0|This is something you will need if you use certain programs since a lot of the usable fonts are in this app and not in the original programs...
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this show.  It can be hard to watch, but then you can not stop watching!  I will be impatiently waiting for Season 3!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Let me start by saying that I would not have be so disappointed in this movie if I didn't so thoroughly enjoy the first three-fourths of it. The problem is that the ending scene is completely nonsensical and it makes me feel cheated, as if the writers ran out of time and decided to just phone in the ending.<br /><br />Great production, great premise, good acting, but an incompetent ending that disappoints as soon as the credits start rolling. If you watch this, be prepared to be let down at the end.<br /><br />[minor spoilers ahead]<br /><br />From the start, I was actually impressed that they defined a loosely coupled connection from past and future realities, which I think is fine if you are honest about it because it gives us a chance to see a movie we haven't already seen before. What really bothers me though is that the kid's mom wouldn't have died in the alternate future because Bruce Willis doesn't kill her in that one - he can't have even been at that farm in his future's alternate past because we clearly see him closing his loop and killing the older him. So then in what possible way is this future better than those two never going to the farm, and in what way has the kids future been altered at all? If I were playing devil's advocate, I could try to make a case that perhaps just meeting the two Joes makes him a better person, but there is no reason for us to believe that given the story told to us. It's much more likely, given what we saw, for us to assume that this is an experience that turns the kid even more dark and morbid than before.<br /><br />It's almost as if the editors changed the ending in post and then added voiceovers to make it looks like that was always going to happen. Really? Ending a circle of violence that isn't a circle and actually hasn't happened at all until now? Come on guys! Your bad writing (or editing) makes waste of an otherwise great movie.
B000LE16VW|5.0|I have seen this movie allot of times and its very touching!!! I would watch it over and over!!!!!!!  Excellent movie!!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Alternate respective on introvert like me was an eye opening experience.  I recommended it to my family to read it, and especially to my young teenage daughter who would benefit from this book.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|it's  really fun! You can take on car trips and leave the mess behind! I think I've filled up half my skrapbook! it's totally worth the 2 dollers!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Having seen the film and I think I have read the book before too, this reading absolutely took me into romantic bliss. Well worth the reread and I think I'll wait a bit before the next reading. But I will read it again. Recommended for anyone who has a slight romantic bone in their body.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The original version still holds up. It's really entertaining and it looks a lot better on my bigger Kindle screen as opposed to my tiny phone.  But Rovio kills me that they have to uninstall and reinstall the game every time they have an update.  All of my progress was once again deleted. There has got to be another way. This never happens on the phone app version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book because of my book club and I almost didn't read it ,I'm glad I did it ws such a nice story . Recomend it for young readers.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|OK book. Fine for reading while riding the bus, when you cannot really focus too much. But not the best I have ever read.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|My mom got an app similar to this for her iPhone and was very pleased with it. I have been equally pleased with this app. It helps keep track of everything and I love that it tells me how much battery certain things will use (I.e. you two hours for videos or five hours for reading books). Very pleased and I would definitely recommend this app. :)

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was the best movie ever! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves good music and some comedy.
B000641D2Y|4.0|The real reason why I wanted this film has everything to do with the ending. I know that seems weird but as a native New Yorker, I just love the scenes between a mom and her son in front of the most spectacular Christmas Tree in the world.  So, there it is.<br /><br />The movie isn't particularly bad or good.  Pretty much the same formula as the first movie with just a few more predictable changes.  But I don't mind sitting through it and going along for the ride.  I could do far worse.
1563896656|5.0|The book arrived within a reasonable time period and in great condition! The edges of the binding were a bit bent, if we're being nit-picky, but you can never expect a used book to be immaculate.
B007N8RULO|5.0|good game, I like it, but as others have said it is rather adicting. can't complain, it was free and I play it often. I have not had any problems with it. I recommend it.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I don't remember how much I paid for this but it's only 4 chapters.  I now know to see how many pages it is before purchasing.  Story was okay, but not worth the money for only 4 chapters.
B009CCBCU4|3.0|An interesting story.  Gets a bit lost in details during the middle, but ends OK. I enjoyed the author's description of the peoples living around &#34;the Great Lake&#34;.

B001GCUER0|3.0|My sister is a fan, so I decided to check out Mad Men. So far, I've viewed seasons One & Two.<br /><br />I was expecting something different. As many reviewers have noted, the sets and decor are relatively true to the era.  However, the behavior is not.  It's as if the writers were trying to superimpose a 21st century hip irony on to the early 1960s.  The characters are repeatedly snarky and cruel, out-of-character for an era when one's social face had to have at least a semblance of graciousness.  The era was a time when social bonds were stronger, and despite many dysfunctions, there seemed to be more caring of one another. In the world of the show, none of the adults has any real loyalty to anyone else.  Each character is self-interested almost to the point of sociopathy.  I haven't yet found a character with a heart, except perhaps the 12-yr-old boy, Glen, who is the Drapers' neighbor.  There's no one to root for or even care about. It reminds me of Nip/Tuck.<br /><br />The depiction of casual sexual mores is also anachronistic.  Yes, there were adulterers in early 1960's, but the amount of sleeping around that happens in this show is a figment of present Hollywood imagination.  The sexual revolution did not occur until the late 1960s, and didn't impact social behavior on a wide scale until the 1970s.  And even THEN, in the pre-AIDS, disco era, the adultery was not taking place as often as it does on this show.  In a Season One episode, we have Roger Sterling asking 20-year-old twin sisters to kiss each other. Like that would have happened then! The whole lesbian chic thing dates from the early 1990s-onward.<br /><br />Yes, the show is enjoyable for the visual immersion into the styles of the time.  Some of the differences in risk/regulation between that era and today are depicted in high relief. Being reminded of \\"the way it was\\" has entertainment value.  People smoked literally everywhere back then, tossed litter like it was nothing, didn't use seatbelts, andconsumed alcohol while pregnant. The show does provide a stylistic window into the early 1960s, but the writers get the attitudes all wrong.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I adored this book. It was a very very fast read and a great story. I got sucked in to the characters and the plot immediately. I loved the story, I loved the writing, etc etc.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Awesome book. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Very well written with great characters that are easy to root for.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|love this game.  staying up all night playing on kindle fire.  got on cell phone first then on kindle and enjoy more on kindle as larger screen and just overall better quality on kindle.  I highly recommend to everyone to give it a go and you WILL be addicted.
0765325950|5.0|Thank You Brandon Sanderson for finishing the Wheel of Time for us!  I have grown old reading it.  I don't like military strategy novels ala' Ringo......and since this last novel was indeed \\"The Last Battle\\".....a lot of the wonderful story was not my favorite thing, but a genuine slog through pages of battle details.  I found myself flipping through pages of army maneuvers in an effort to follow the storyline. Brandon Sanderson is normally a much better author than this and did a fabulous job on the previous novels.  I have to agree with other reviewers that this last novel of the series seems to have been outlined, with sections dictated, by Harriet and Robert Jordan.  Brandon Sanderson did his best to tie it all together with his excellent character portrayals and those sections of his style were excellent.  Then someone said, hey, this novel needs to weight 5 lbs so we need another 400 pages of army maneuvers to stretch it out.  Then it seems to have been edited to pieces and jigsawed back together?  Who knows.  Just goes to show you a book cannot be written by committee. But I am still thankful that everyone took the time and effort to complete this series.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tiny Fey and have wanted to read this book since it came out. It did not disappoint. I should have bought it sooner!
B0039N74CW|4.0|This movie has many funny moments and some great references to other childhood classics and fairy tales.  It is has raunchy humor, a few scary parts, language and references that might not be appropriate for those under 7....above 8 years old it is a good movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book!! I can't wait to read the next one. Hope the next one holds a great ending!  Give it 5 stars!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Our Version of Events has been on repeat since I downloaded the album.  Excellent lyrics, and her voice is very different and great to listen to.  The British influence (somewhat obvious since she is Scottish) is definitely present.  &#34;Where I sleep&#34; and &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; are fantastic, as well as the single &#34;Next to Me&#34;.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This season packs it all in.  Crazies, aliens, torture, religion, Nazis, zombies (of a sort), urban legend, serial killers... I possibly even missed a few.  It does it in well-filmed, well-directed, and extremely well-acted episodes (with the one exception of the inconsistent Boston accents).  Some truly phenominal acting performances and some truly disturbing scenarios.  Very much enjoyed this season.
B00979CS50|4.0|You like Neil Young and Crazy Horse, then you will like this.  Driftin Back, Ramada Inn and Walk Like a Giant are all classic NYCH songs - it just takes an hour to listen to all three.  The other songs on the disc, to include the title track are good, some a little weaker than others, but overall this is another good piece of work from Neil Young
1592402038|5.0|Edith Wharton writes so delicately and sympathetically, revealing the provincialism of New York society without judgement or superiority.  The book is remarkable on many levels and her description of that long ago era is quite vivid and believable.  I thoroughly appreciated it.
0316228532|5.0|I judge a book on three factors:<br /><br />1. Do I care about the characters?<br /><br />2. Can I not wait to see what's going to happen when I read it?<br /><br />3. Am I thinking about it when I'm done reading it?<br /><br />Yes to all three for this novel! So good! It's dark, it's gritty, it's funny, it's a portrait of real life with some extra drama thrown in. Forget that she wrote Harry Potter. This is a totally different genre. It was great.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It was a good romantic and slightly sad read full of surprises and drama! It would be a good chick flick if they make it into a movie I would definitely buy the movie :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Exciting, captivating, romantic but nit fishy and intriguing. Couldn't get enough. Can't wait to start the sequel. A must read.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It's Adobe reader. What else can I say! It works as advertised. I am very satisfied with the results. Yep!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I was able to watch this movie without fast forwarding through vilolence, sexuality, or foul langague.  It was enjoyable, ineresting and relaxing.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|Don't think this free game, based on a franchised concept for children, will allow you to be clever and patient in order to advance. I have spent countless cumulative hours with this, there is no way to advance without the precious gems, unless you enjoy mindlessly repeating rhythms of no hope.<br /><br />The graphics are great and the pirates actually do silly things, but most free games with in app purchase abilities still give you a shot at winning precious gems or acorns or peanuts, or something you need go forward.<br /><br />Without an upgrade to your pirate ship (it's a pirate game), there is little point in wasting time with this. It takes hundreds of jewels to upgrade your pirate ship. The game does not give jewels away easily. So $$$$$ away!<br /><br />Of all the free games I've ever tried, this one is *so* misleading, it is a demo in sheep's clothing.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in a few hours. It's a very easy read. Parts are a bit hard to follow, however, because the narrator's train of thought is so jumbled, but I guess that's the point.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Awesome move. I am very satisfied with this purchase as I am with most Amazon purchases. Good price and fast download.
1455518999|5.0|Well done. Baldacci has taken the current events of mining in West Virginia and given the happenings a fictional twist. Even within Federal Agencies, there are disagreements on what should be done, how to curtail or even stop these intrusions, which I call the 'raping of our land.' I have friends living in or near West Virginia and have heard their reactions. Great writing. Maybe through fiction, the powers to be can realize what destruction they are allowing to happen and at whose expense - the people.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|i did not like the directors cut version, which related this violent action movie(the reason i bought it) to a comic book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool and fun like the selection of horses and like feeding them cool tack and great graphics and so realistic
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is one of the best books possible if all the others were free I would read all the other books
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Even though this is awesome sequel to temple run, the game won't let me play it some times, I will tap it to play it ,and then it will load for a little while and then send me back to my home screen.
B0091REZMW|3.0|good hidden objects game, although it does get a little redundant on placement of items in the rooms.  when opening the application it does seem to have issues opening and may take a few tries to finally load.  if you want this game to be free, be patient...coins, diamonds, and other items can be earned or gifted from friends easily.  overall, it is a good game to just do hunt and find.
0446580848|2.0|I am a big DeMille fan, but this one really missed the mark.  I found it a redundant, rambling, rant against virtually everything.  A 600+ page arduous journey to nowhere, via the scenic route.  I don't know if DeMille is attempting to be another Zola or Dickens, a great social commentator, but with this novel he really missed the mark.  Social commentary is valuable, but not at the expense of story value.  I hope the author stops taking himself so damn seriously and just gets back to being a truly great storyteller.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it...my first time ever playing temple run! I would highly recommend. I have a kindle fire hd works great!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game has a very interesting layout. Nice simple fun game. For me it does not get repetitive. Only complaint is that the game is not always responsive to your actions. Most of the time it is but every once in awhile it screws up. Neat game though. Better than the original. Kitsan!
B0012GMW34|5.0|In my opinion the love devotion surrender album by Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra is one of the best albums ever made.
B007L6VR6M|1.0|Can't rate the MOVIE because I didn't get to see it. I gave the Combo pack away because I &#34;thought&#34; I had it on demand anytime I wanted....WRONG! The following item was ordered from Amazon. It said that with the purchase of the Combo pack, and an On Demand view too. When I tried to watch it today by clicking on the link provided in the email with my purchase it came up fine and then wanted me to PAY to watch it!! I already paid once thank you! It asked for a promo code, but the email doesn't include a code....Nice....NOT!<br />I've been saving watching it for a snowy day. Well that snowy day is here and now I can't access it on my computer. I guess it means you have to watch it immediately or they take it away. Pretty deceiving.<br />Moonrise Kingdom [Video On Demand]<br />Sold By: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.<br />This item was included as a gift with your purchase of Moonrise Kingdom (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) on Blu-ray<br />You can Watch It Instantly
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So sorry this season is ending soon, but can't wait to see how it ends! Looking forward to next season!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I'm amazed how it could actually guess everything correctly!! I only beat the akinator once!!<br />It is defenetly worth purchasing.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I GAVE THIS  MOVIE TO MY 7 YEAR OLD GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS.  SHE LOVES MUSIC AND SINGING.  I AM SURE SHE WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS I DID.  GOOD PRICE AND SHIPPING SERVICE AS USUAL!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Game, was a great read. I found my self not wanting to put it down! Can't wait to read book 2!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Keeps you thinking!  Great for passing the time.  I enjoyed winning all my games;  something I never thought that I could do.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up Married  was a comfortable read and I enjoyed the authors style and maintained my interest until the end.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this dictionary. very helpful.<br />when you check a word, it will show all the antonyms and synonyms. LIKE!
B001J9AQA0|5.0|I love this album, it's best next to Adel!  All the songs on the album are great, one never has to skip a song; because the are great.  The vocals are wonderful, I highly recommend this album.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I think other people should read this book and this is a book that will get parents aware of the things that could happen if they don't take control and make sure there child has a safe environment to live in
0634022296|5.0|This book makes all the Beatle's songs playable. Awesome... I am having so much fun playing the music of my favorite all time band....
B005FITIDC|5.0|I love this movie. It was so inspirational and encouraging as you watched the main character struggle to do something good for people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is very fun and I recommend it<br />if you diside to get this app you will love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good sex, love and drama. The characters are very interesting and I was entertained and kept reading to find out what would happen next!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Just what I needed for the dreary days of January.  Descriptions were beautiful, the characters intriguing.  Hard to believe it is over 500 pages----it flew by.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I;ve seen all of the Mission Impossible movie. I can honestly say that is probably my favorite oif the series
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my son loves this game. Its very entertaining and he really likes all the graphic's.  Good distraction when mom needs a little piece and quite while waiting to see Dr. or just on long road trips..
B007FEFLTO|3.0|As usual, a pretty captivating read from Ken Follett, although not quite as interesting as the previous book.  The background information about WWII was educational.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My grandson always enjoy seeing this movie. We select it quite often. it has a good plot with no violence or harsh words.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First time reading this author.  Loved the book ... chose it bc of the reviews it received & I was not disappointed!  Nice, easy read
B007X6SMD6|4.0|What can I say ? It's a light reading, with a clear and simple example that highlights the AWS's core simplicity. I highly recommend it for newcomers.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|The first two were good, the prequel didn't bring anything new to the table and this one suffers from crappy writing. I bought it for the collection purposes. The movie just feels empty.
0307596885|2.0|I did not care for this book.  Stories all seem dreary and gray. Dulll, sad, boring, colorless people.  They all seem to be waiting for life to end.
0525478817|5.0|I really loved this product because it was a really well written book although sad at the end. Everyone on Tumblr talks about this book and say how good it is and I wanted to try it and I got a gift card from Christmas to amazon so I decided, why not? It also got here super fast. So thanks.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love going to different areas on the screen to see what the weather is like or will be like.  We will be traveling to Orlando and Arizona this winter.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Thought the story line was well developed and kept you locked in until the very end.  Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love this app! I used it with our children for naptimes during a loud time. I love to use it to help me sleep at night since I am a very light sleeper and it works Great! Also love the variety of alarm sounds. Couldn't love it more!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I can never get enough Dexter! Every season know just how to draw you back,  who or how will he kill next? Who will his new love interest be? What will happen to Aster and Cody? Will his son end up like him?
B0060MYM7O|1.0|I am an avid reader of the Song of Ice and Fire series. I adored what they did with the first season of HBO's Game of Thrones. The second season, however, is akin to smearing s*** on my television and making sure to get it in all the small crevices. The plodding along with Robb Stark's new relationship was boring at best. As far as the books go, Daenerys should have owned this season but somehow they found a way to make her story uninteresting as well. I give this season poop.turd stars.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, Tom Clancy has done it again.  Great and current storyline, with a well developed characters and plot.  Always exhibits great knowledge of subject matter.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Like being able to compete against own times, allows multiple attempts at same levels, some of the levels (am playing on a Kindle Fire) are still smaller than I would prefer, its difficult to distinguish what level the cards are on but all in all good free game!
1594487154|5.0|This is the third book by Daniel Pink I have read and I didn't have high expectations.  Usually by the third book a non-fiction writer in Psychology or Self-Help is simply repeating themselves.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by \\"To Sell Is Human\\".  If you want one of the best popular books on how to be persuasive this is it.  This book has Amazon's \\"Search Inside\\" feature which gives you the opportunity to preview a number of pages.<br /><br />Very well done and highly practical.  Recommended.
B00006879E|4.0|I bought this CD along with &#34;Hands All Over Me&#34; and &#34;Overexposed&#34; also by Maroon 5. It's pretty much a toss up over which one I like the best, but this one ranks right up there. Pretty much I just shuffle between the three of them. In my opinion you really ought to have all three!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really enjoy playing the game!  Really like the cards easy slide. Recommend this for your app. It is addictive so be prepared to play a lot.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|very very good product.  The picture is great, the sound is good and I had not problem with playing it on my DVD.
B009E3EXMU|1.0|The show is awesome, so the DVD is awesome, but the CD?<br /><br />The songs you will listen to over and over . . . the songs you put into your iTunes library . . . someone should be ashamed! A sloppy, lazy job of splitting the songs on the CD. The intro to several songs are at the end of the previous song. So, when you listen to them out of order . . . well, it's annoying, to say the least. So annoying to me, in fact, that I felt compelled to write this.<br /><br />You may not find a bigger fan than me, so I'm upset when Plant introduces Trampled Underfoot or (the fantastic version of) For Your Life . . . and . . . it's not next after all!<br /><br />Dang!
B005EVVESM|5.0|The picture on the &#34;album&#34; cover makes it look like this might be a little raunchy. But it really isn't. The music it fast and upbeat, a little more modern than the music I grew up with in the eighties. But the lyrics are fun, the beat is fast and it's fun to dance to. Kind of puts you into a feel good mood!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game soo much! Its soo addicting. It keeps you guessing and on your toes. A must buy!
B00004CY38|1.0|This DVD is no good.  When I put into my DVD player it give a region error.  I don't know how to send it back to the sender,  because there were no packaging inside. Worst product I ever brought from amazon
B003VANOFY|3.0|These things are really slow to turn on.  And you have to hold the button down for quite a while or it doesn't turn on at all.  Probably not a problem for gamers, but I use them for skype.  Every time someone calls, I have to scramble around trying to get the darn things turned on while they wait and say, &#34;hello?&#34;, &#34;hello?&#34;.<br /><br />Just thought I should warn anyone else who wants to use them the way I do.
B0083F5JE6|5.0|I bought this Album after seeing the lead singer on &#34;The Voice&#34;. I usually lean a little more towards 80's music or country but I heard one of Maroon 5's songs and thought I'd try it out. It is my FAVORITE CD!!! I play it all the time!! I have it downloaded on my computer, and my MP3 player and it rarely gets back into it's case!!! If you want some upbeat music to dance to this would be it!!!!
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is a gift for my granddaughters who are big, big Lego fans.  They haven't got it yet but I know they will love it when they do.
0765325950|5.0|not an hour ago finished reading the conclusion to the Wheel of Time series. What an emotional tidal wave the last hundred pages were. If you've read this far into things.... read this book. Great Stuff.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are developing constantly--nothing static about them. The story lines are continuing seamlessy from season one. I just wish I could watch it more than once on Amazon Prime...
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good but would have liked to have read more about what happened while he was in a coma on the other side
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was al-awsome. One of the best gamez.  &iuml; love it!!!!!  it was al-awsome. One of the best gamez.  &iuml; love it!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book a lot, for the story and unusual way it was put together.  I could hardly put it down, in fact.  But the ending was not believable to me and I was disappointed in that.  Still, it makes for an interesting page-turner.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys &#34;murder&#34; mysteries.  It reads like true crime novels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is awesome lots of my friends had it so I played it&hellip;&hellip;love at first sight!!&lt;3 hope you enjoy as much as I do:)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game. It is so much better than the first one. I like the graphics. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because it freezes a lot.
0425252868|5.0|So you think of historical books as boring? This book will change your mind and may even convince you to become a fan. You find yourself cheering alternatively for each side in the conflict called World War II. The detail shows clearly Adam Makos has done a terrific job with the research. Please read his book. You won't be disappointed. YouTube the title and be treated with a bonus: Conversation with the two main characters after their reunion.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Have owned this product for several months now.  I kept noticing that while I was connected to the Wi-Fi that I would be unable to browse any websites.<br /><br />Finally shut down the device and used another access point.  Since I was having a hard time getting any signal for a wi-fi only device in the far part of my home, I set out to fix the problem with this access point.<br /><br />I upgraded the firmware, and was able to get it to function somewhat, but I couldn't get it to repeat the signal of my other AP, I had to setup another SSID.<br /><br />2 days later, Wi-Fi signal was gone again.  Checked on the router and the PoE light was on, but no other lights.  Device won't even power on at all now.<br /><br />I think I got about 2 months of use out of this expensive, over priced device.<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMED!!!!!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I definately enjoy the game and that's probably because I have a credit card to buy coins and gems if I want. My 5 year old niece and my 7 year old nephew really wanted to play so I let them and as I watched them they had no clue what the concept of the game is. They would just randomly tap on anything. Wish there was a better child friendly version.
B0013HYLT0|5.0|Grew up with Mary Poppins. I loved the music and fun as a child and love giving it to my children to listen to now.  Great sound quality with all the important tracks.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|This is for my nephew they love this movie I wanted to get a good copy so that's why brought up mucus of the cheap
B009TSA6YE|5.0|This is a tour de force for Michael Schenker.  I have many past Schenker dvds and this one is by far the best.  His solos are spot on, note for note, and the band is tight.  I won't get into the vocals, they're good, but I prefer Gary Barden, although his voice is not what it used to be.  Michael Schenker, together with ex-scorpions, and Wayne Findlay lay it down and deliver big time!  I love the set list which includes plenty of MSG and almost half of the Lovedrive album, (Coast To Coast is great to hear live) and a nice slice of UFO.  Michael's signature song \\"Rock Bottom\\" is perhaps the best version I've ever heard. His solos are flawless and the energy level is high.  One unexpected gem on this dvd is to see Wayne Findlay solo on \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane.\\" He really holds the band together.  Other highlights include Holiday, Shoot Shoot, and Blackout.  I would recommend this to any Schenker fan.  We will never know if we get to see another one like this!
B0031R5K72|5.0|This is one of the most succinct tales about humanity I have ever read, embodying all that's best and worst about people in one childhood.<br /><br />What I found most interesting was the narration of 'Death'. Looking at things through Death's eyes was a new experience.<br /><br />Markus Zusak succeeds, in just a short few hundred pages, of giving us the very best and the very worst that humanity has to offer. Death's closing statements could be the most prophetic words ever said.<br /><br />If you haven't already, you should definitely read it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I myself usually prefer murder/mystery, I saw previews for this movie and thought, why not read the book. I love this book, this is the best book I have ever read!!!!
B004L73FO6|5.0|My son Orgas I don't know what it is and how it sounds all I knows his friend and I don't really know what else to say
B008VBYN80|5.0|pretty cool u can advance even without usin real money<br />ggghmbjbgbbhvvybbb e e e d a a eds d ed
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I thought this was the new batman movie so I started it and crap it was the old one..... so I stopped it. Really good movie though, sorry
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was absolutely great in every way. I have only one complaint. The ending was more or less anticlimactic.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Sure these are not going to compare to high end products...But for the price they have a great range of sound, light weight, fit well and exceeded my expectations. I would purchase this product again and recommend to anyone looking for inexpensive headphones to be used for workouts or just sitting around listening to music.
B002RI9VVM|5.0|I read this book in school over 20 years ago, it is still of relevance as much today as when it was written.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was truly amazing from the first page to the last. I said up till 2am reading this book. When I got to the last page I wanted the book to keep going.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|dome great music, few interruptions with blah, blah, blah.  Program director should be applauded.  It's free and worth putting on your android.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Experiments is not my favorite Cut the Rope game, but I only $.99 for it, and it is quite challenging.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|at least the phone is ok though.  but that's $60 for one drop.  almost the same price to replace the screen.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app its a great way to pass time and very fun on rainy days...plus yu can challenge your friends
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome. Just all around awesome. Period. Loved every minute of it & I'm excited for the movie coming out soon ! :))))
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love all of the Angry Birds episodes, but the Seasons one is continually updated with something new and exciting, making it a must-have for all bird brains!  I especially like the Chinese and St. Patrick's themes with their catchy music and visual effects.  It keeps it interesting!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun. I have only rode a horse twice so this game really makes me feel like I am taking care of a horse.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I played this game on my friends ipod and it was really fun but I paid a dollar for it and it wont install.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I chose this book as I'm a huge John Grisham fan and have always enjoyed his work. This book had me hooked from page one!  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves legal dramas.
B004GYY714|5.0|I LOVE this radio!  There are tons of radio stations for every style imaginable, and stations from all over the world I never thought even existed.  It's a must-have.
B008QFWNBA|5.0|the movie was great it was really cool but seamed short the second one will probably be available in the next 4 to 6 years from 2013 they claim that they will take the graphics from the lord of the rings of the strange creature(  i don't really like the movies ) and make it look believable
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like horses so I like this game but I wish you could do more stuff like actually ride the horse! btw the competition thing will NOT load! Other than those few quirks it is a nice little game!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and found this one hard to put down. Great read and interesting story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|BEST battery app I have seen so far.Amazingly in depth,it gives information about usage ,nicely broken down,it gives a very accurate reading of all relevant features.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Pat Monaghan & Train seem to have a knack for churning out wonderful pop/rock songs, I wonder how many top 40 hits will come out of this album (all 11?)
B009VB97EY|4.0|Cute men dancing semi-nude… some extreme nudity some not as extreme… nice story, a bit slow to get to the point , but if you like Channing , Matthew, white collar or CSI Miami you may want to sneak a peek
0545425115|5.0|While reading the Hunger Games, I was pleasantly surprised by how much better it was than the movie. I have heard from many times from people who have said, \\"Oh, if you've seen the movie, there is no point in reading the novel. You will already know the major events that occur and the factor of suspense will not excite you.\\" However, I completely disagree. Before reading the novel, I had already seen the movie and I was still able to enjoy the book thoroughly. The book was thrilling, suspenseful and extremely detail oriented, much more so than the movie. For example, when reading the book, Collins is able to dive into the thoughts of Katniss and the reder is able to comprehend the events that take place much easier. In addition, the movie was unable to capture many of the events that occurred in the novel for many reasons. For example, after the games are over, the novel goes on to explain the after math of the games and its effects on everybody around Peeta and Katniss. All in all, I felt the story was excellently written and is definitely worth reading.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|My children loved it for the action and of course it's Halo. The graphics were good, the plot was good, overall it was pretty good.
1781161097|5.0|To say I am a fan of Ridley Scott is like saying that I am a fan of breathing or being alive; it's just sorta a given.  As a filmmaker, he's one of my idols; as a storyteller, he's one of the masters.  In short, the man can do almost no wrong in my eyes.  So when the fine folks at Titan Books released PROMETHEUS: THE ART OF THE FILM, I knew it was going to be a must-have for me.  And the book does not disappoint in the least.  It is an excellent behind-the-scenes look at the concept art that inspired and helped shape Scott's recent reentry into science-fiction.<br /><br />If you've seen the film, then you already know how rife the imagery is with astute precision and detail.  Scott is very meticulous with how his sets and props look, and this is always evident onscreen.  This book takes you beyond the film, and shows you the detail that was put into every little piece of what you see in the movie.<br /><br />The photos in PROMETHEUS: THE ART OF THE FILM are breathtaking and the concept art is staggeringly good.  It is always amazing to see how close the finished onscreen product can resemble the concept art, and this book gives you plenty of examples.  From hand-drawn images to full-fleshed computer animation, there's something for every science-fiction and/or art fan here.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that I thoroughly enjoy is the written descriptions of what each picture is and why it is important.  We get to learn many things about the film, including the reasoning behind certain events and even the functionality of some of the set pieces.  This gives an air of intrigue to several items that I completely missed when I watched the film itself.<br /><br />The book itself is a very nice hardback edition with large pages and beautiful graphics.  Collector's of film memorabilia will want to snatch this one up as soon as possible, as well fans of the film and just science-fiction fans in general.  This book will make a welcome addition to your library and even bea great conversation-started on your coffee table.  Give it a look today.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|she a beautiful lawyer in the big city, he father is an aging scouting agent for a baseball team, when their lives start falling apart they end up relying on each other to move on with their lives and let family help each other. Clint Eastwood is believable as the crotchety old father set in his ways, and Amy  and Justin are surprisingly well matched as potential sweethearts.
B005BRSQ5I|4.0|The concepts in the Seven Laws are concepts I can relate to and put in practice.  My take away is the the laws of success is faith, faith in vision for your life as designed by the Creator and walking out the vision trusting that everything is orchestrate for you as you serve humanity and the Most High God.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I think I was expecting The Bourne Legacy to be like the other sequels but was soon disappoint and mad at the end of the movie so I am lead to believe there is another sequel.
B002VKB0M4|2.0|I was a student in Paris when it was still....Paris.  Maybe because I was young but it was magical and beautiful then and the people were charming.  I have been back a few times and frankly found the people crankier but it was still beautiful.  Now, I don't know if this film is an accurate picture of present day Parisians but I found theses characters hard to like or to care about.  Maybe it was just the film maker's point of view.<br /><br />The story line is one that sounds good on paper....glimpses of the lives of several sets of people of different social groups and how their lives interact.  It's an idea that has been done very well elsewhere, as in \\"Crash.\\"  Here somehow it doesn't work so well. The main story line concerns a young male cabaret dancer who has just been told that he has a heart disease and that only a transplant can save him and that gives him just a 50-50 chance of survival.  His sister, a single mother with three small children, begs a little time off from her social work job in order to move in to take care of him.  Somehow although he's not bed-ridden and seems to function well enough he can't manage to help her with any of the housework so she does it all while he mopes around looking out the the window and goes through old photos. Every time we see him a sad tune plays on the piano.  Somehow that's not enough to give me any sympathy for him.  He calls a girl he once danced with in 6th grade to tell her how much he loved it. She hangs up so he drinks a beer and vomits and the social worker sister has to leave her job to rush home and hold his head.<br /><br />That's about the tone of it.  At one point when the dancer gets a call saying there's a heart waiting for him he rides in a cab and waxes supremely sentimental about Life in Paris....\\"Oh why don't these people realize how lucky they are!\\"  He does utter one true statement...that no one is happy there and they love to complain.  That's probably why this film, which is supposed to be meaningful is such a downer.<br /><br />There are a few good moments, mostly with Juliette Binoche who is still quite beautiful.  The best is when she does a strip tease before the guy from the fruit stand.  It's not really worth sitting through all the other tedious, pseudo-meaningful stuff though.  If you're looking for beautiful shots of Paris, or the old French films with real heart and charm, (Truffaut, Malle, etc.) this isn't it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is perfect for what I need it for. I not only get to check the weather for where I live, but I can track the weather for my family in other states and wherever my husband is deployed. My kids really like that aspect.
1609611543|5.0|Very good information.  Well-researched.  Well footnoted.  And I enjoy Dr. Davis' personal experiences both at home and in his practice.  Sometimes 'anecdotal' evidence can be the most compelling.  Strongly recommend this book if you want to know what wheat is really doing to your health.  Hint:  &#34;healthy whole grains aren't so healthy anymore.&#34;
B009369Z8A|5.0|Lawless in my opinion started out a bit slow but soon became interesting and seeing how lawless it really was back in those days. Moonshine was a big thing back then.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|I have this case for my Kindle Paperwhite and I love the look of it; it looks like an old book! So when I saw it for Kindle Fire, I thought I'd buy it as well. The cover looks nearly identical to the one I love on my Paperwhite, but is larger. The Fire attaches with some elastic bands. They're snug and fit well, but at the back of my mind I wonder how long it will remain tight. But the thing that concerns me the most is that the cover doesn't lay completely flat when I close it. Not sure why, perhaps in a few weeks it will but I almost wish it had some other way of keeping it closed, like an elastic band or a tab.<br /><br />Still, a good looking case that protects the Kindle Fire well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This set is great ! Breakdown:<br />Value: 5/5<br />Movies: 5/5<br />Packaging: 4/5 (could do better since this is Blu Ray)

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I watched American Horror Story season 1 and loved it.  I have personal experience with religious life and nuns and although there are some moral issues for me because nuns are a significant part of the story line I have to say that Sister Jude became my favorite hero nun a few episodes back.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing Bingo games and this one hasnt disappointed me at all. There are other games to play besides Bingo within the application.  I think you will be pleased. the game has frozen on any screens. i havent had 1 issue with it. I would buy other games from this company.

B001PTG4BO|5.0|a well written and interesting look at how digital storage and technology is changing business. If you are under 30 a lot of this book will be pretty darn intuitive and if you are over then they do a good job at describing the younger generation.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|Even if you are not a P!nk fan, this concert DVD will turn you into one!  She does a phenomenal job in this concert, the choreography is outstanding and the costumes are so perfect.  Glitter in The Air at the end is one of the most beautiful scenes.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|...so what are you reading this for?<br /><br />If you are wavering, you should be aware that this movie depicts unlikely and unrealistic events.  It is probably all lies and it will just make you angry.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|It seems that the Muppets and co. take an old story such as a Christmas Carol and throw themselves in it to give a Muppet twist.  This works if one is a Muppets fan.<br /><br />I am a Muppets fan.<br /><br />Michael Caine is excellent, and the Muppets are great and this sticks to the basic tenets of the story.<br /><br />Great for kids also.
0385536828|4.0|This book is a very interesting and engaging read.  Doesn't totally head in the expected direction.  It doesn't hit you in the gut like Atonement did, which is a good thing to me.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Have read all Connelly's HB's books to date.  These short stories are frosting on the cake, since this is Harry's neighborhood and occupational milieu.  Have not read anything of Connelly's that I did not find fascinating.

B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I've been sick of our deluge of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels of goldie oldies for fifteen years and after trying to keep my eyes open in this horrendous mess, i left the theater and felt mad beause I wasted two hours of my life and paid $6.00 for doing so.<br /><br />One of my major complaints is that flop-master Colin Farrel was cast in Ah-nuld's role. This actor seems to carry a bad luck curse in whatever movie he is in. He starred in another remake of a favorite, Fright Night. IT's flop was so disastrous it went to DVD in just a month or two after its theatrical debut.<br /><br />In this one, he has one expression: a bug-eyed look that makes him look like he's in constant shock/surprise. Or, he resembles someone with the OMG expression of staring into a pair of headlights.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is just a total hurricane of blasting sound effects, constant battles with the she monster. I'm trying to find out the name of the next movie Colin Ferrel will be in so I can be sure to avoid it.<br /><br />I read that this botched remake cost nearly $100 million. I thought of all the young, movie-maker hopefuls out there brimming with new ideas that could result in a new movie franchise who could have taken just $1 million and given us something new and fresh.<br /><br />Those days are gone when we could go to a movie theater and be thrilled with something fabulous like Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Sadist, Psycho, Halloween.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was an amazing book. I read it after watching a talk show that Dr. Alexander was on  explaining his story I was so amazed with his experience that I had to read it. Everyone should read this  book it will make you laugh, cry and even think what our future hold for us. I truly believe in God and this story makes it even better.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Should provide a greater selection of free music.  Not accustomed to purchases songs on an individual basis.  Advertised as a place to store up to 250 songs in the cloud, yet would not accept some of the songs stored on my computer and does not offer a great variety of free music.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Works great. Nice visual effects and sounds. Never crashes and is fun to play. I've been hooked on this game that never disappoints.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I read it mostly because of how popular it is in the theaters and I never see a movie without reading the book first.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Enjoyed Josh Brolin nailing Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K mannerisms spot-on while finessing his own stamp to the 'younger' Agent K. Not easy to do in a film series of such visual & broad comedy. Made me want to watch the two of them again in 'No Country for Old Men', to see what a difference 5 years has made. Good money spent for the rental, which was fun to watch twice for acting apart from the film's story.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|There was nothing wrong with my dvd. It came on time and was the quality I was expecting. I love Sweeny Todd.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie Johnny Depp is terrific! Like the show from the early 1970's so I think everyone would like this one too.
B005ISZRES|5.0|This is one of the best classics of all time. I read it as a child and still re-read it as an adult and see or understand something different every time. This should be on everyone's shelves!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Could NOT finish watching '21 Jump Street', but followed the hype to Magic Mike. Nice showcase for Tatum & McConaughey - all kinda fun ways. I liked the Village People vamp camp move into Channing's big hip-hop solo, after which the story fell flat into 'seen-ALL-of-this' predictability. So I fell asleep. Still, actors inhabited their world well enough that I made sure to go back and watch the ending. Sexiest man of the year?  I'm curious to see Channing after he gets some father life experience, especially whether his comedic or dramatic acting deepens first.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it!!!! I highly recommend this book. It keeps you guessing from start to finish and in between! A must read!!!

B009LL4LMM|2.0|Sure, it is a fun physics game, but why does it need permissions to start at reboot?  I don't play this every time I power on.  I can't have resource eaten up unnecessarily.  I have to uninstall.
B003QSLW0K|4.0|My three year old enjoyed it, but it is definitely for older kids.  :-)  A bit quirky, certainly an original.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|a good game for new players to learn how to play the game. it is good because it lets you redo a move.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|A landmark comic becomes a bona fide animation classic.  NOT FOR KIDS.  This is Batman against utter darkness.  Brutal, violent, and operatic in scale and feeling, this is the best animated Batman feature ever released by Warner Bros.<br /><br />Bravo, Bruce Timm.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was hooked from the first chapter, but I was disappointed with the ending. I usually re-read books all the time, but I don't think I'll take the time to re-read this again

B00B2V66VS|1.0|If you have the same problem as me please agree. Every time I am about to get a high score an ad pops up and makes me play the level all over again. The game in it self is fun but the pop ups are pulling me away from playing:)

B0012NIF56|1.0|The resolution and sound is terrible. I played it for my kids. If you will charge $3.00 for this old movie, then please offer better quality. Otherwise, this quality should be offered (at best) complimentary for your good customers.

034580404X|5.0|Now I see what all the hype is about. These books were very hard to put down. I read all three of them within a week. I hope the author continues the story somehow.
B007LNJ4YW|2.0|Way overhyped album - don't believe the hype. I guess you can classify this album in the Chillwave category. But whereas some of the better Chillwave groups have that certain catchy and memorable sound - Beach House doesn't. It's very difficult to differentiate the songs from each other because known of the songs on this album have an actual catchy hook or beat. Very few choruses and nothing really to grab the listener's attention on here. I know what they were going for here - drone with some fuzz and girl vocals - but it's not quite working well enough on this album. Repetition is good to a point but then you need to have something substantial underneath or the hooky-chorus to go with it - this album is not quite understanding of this concept.<br /><br />Decent vocals, average Casio keyboard work, and artys look to the album cover. Not bad to listen to while falling asleep. But better to pass on this album and look into some other bands in this same vein but that do it a lot better.

B000IDCJK8|5.0|If you are a guy and do not like High Plains Drifter...well...you probably aren't from around here.  What ever that means.
B006ZCWTV0|4.0|A little perspective:  Rolling Stone ranking this as the best album of 2012 means either it was a pretty mediocre year for music or they are hyper-infatuated with Springsteen.  Probably a little truth in both.  That said, this is a very good album.  It's really good to see him trying new sounds on songs like Rocky Ground and Death To My Hometown.  All the better that this really works as these are among his best songs in years.<br /><br />There are no bad songs here but there are several that are a bit too repetitive in style from so much of his other material.  The lyrics are a far cry from his 70s and 80s work, delivered without any subtlety whatsoever.  However, to his credit, this was clearly Bruce's intent as he titled the album Wrecking Ball. He clearly felt so strongly that he wanted to deliver the messages with no wiggle room for misinterpretation.<br /><br />All in all, not quite up there with his best, but certainly his best album since The Rising.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|it was really good it stayed on one topic<br /><br />i choose this book because i really like wimpy kid series<br />i like it because it can relate to people<br />i would recomemed it to someone be cause it a best seller

1423124111|5.0|This is a large coffee table style book displaying various attraction posters.  The book is called Poster Art for the Disney Parks, but not all parks are represented fully.  Since most posters are from rides in the Magic Kingdom, that gets the biggest section.  Each land in the MK has its own chapter with a brief writeup about the posters.  Since every park (Disneyland, Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disney and Disneyland Paris) has a Magic Kingdom, the attractions are all mixed in based on the land.  Some attractions that appear in multiple parks will have multiple posters, but not all (no Buzz Lightyear for WDW).  After the MK, there is a chapter for California Adventure and Tokyo DisneySea.  Noticeably missing are the other WDW parks (Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom).  If one of the other parks has a ride that appears in one of those three, there may be a poster for it, but not always.<br /><br />According to the book, the non-MK parks used less posters.  But, posters do exist because in the first chapter they show small versions of posters from those 3 parks, so why not include them???<br /><br />The posters range from quarter page to full page (hopefully your favorite is a full page - because they look great).  The small WDW non-MK posters in the first chapter are about 1/6 page.  An extra full page poster is included in the back and can be torn out (I won't, but maybe you will).  It is a back to back sheet, so really two posters.<br /><br />If you like attraction posters and their art, or you like Disney and want a remembrance of rides still here and some gone, get this book.<br /><br />I decided not to downgrade the review to 4 stars for the lack of posters from the 3 parks, but that lack really makes it a 4 1/2 star book.
B000OY8NII|1.0|When i bought fringe Amazon Recommended Eureka to me , Amazon always Makes me Happy with Recommendation , This was my Frist Disappointment . the Show is Very Dull .

B0050SYS5A|3.0|The zoom does show a considerable distance from the players, the major drawback of this device is that the camera and sensor visibility detracts edges dark because black is obstructing the kinect
B0055SJVPW|5.0|I read the book a few times and hoped that the movie would be just a good.  I absolutely loved it and will enjoy watching it many times on Blu Ray.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is what I expect from a game designer. Interesting plot, great graphics, &amp; just enough challenge to make me want come back for more.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|The second novel in this series does not disappoint. We are presented with another cozy mystery, in which the characters and life in Botswana play a much more prominent role than the case itself. In most cases, I would say that this is a drawback, but McCall Smith's writing is so good, that the reader finds himself happily devouring the pages and learning about Mma Ramotswe and her entourage.<br /><br />Not only do we get a depiction of culture in Botswana, we get this through the colorful commentary of the characters. When I read lines like \\"\\"old Botswana morality, as everybody knew, was so plainly right\\" I can't help it but break a smile. The dialogues are truly priceless, and even the thoughts of some characters, such as the evil and conniving maid of Ramotswe's fiance, are truly entertaining.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, there is not much emphasis on the couple of cases in which the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is focusing on, but this is fine. The part that does bother me a little though, and is the reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the main character reaches conclusions without us having any idea of what the reasoning was. For example, she decides someone is a bad person by looking at a picture, or she gets a clear profile of family and work of a woman she meets just by looking at her and what she is carrying. But we never know how she determined this, which is frustrating. I much rather have the logic described similar to what we get with Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, a small defect that overall does not invalidate the great appeal of this book.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|I bought this for my 8 yr old grandson and he loves it.  He listens to it alllllllll the time.  That is why I also bought him a walkman with headphones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The read is so much better then the movie. A bit harsh and deadly but remember this is not reality. My grandson asked that I start reading them so we will be able to talk about them. That is the best deal.
B00442OHNG|4.0|I enjoy this quirky, fun and action-oriented series.<br />One of my favorites in recent years.<br />More like this would be appreciated.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just installed the app today. We like it as a wonderful alternative to having another horse. For some reason it had to be forced closed twice and uninstalled twice due to it freezing up on the kindle fire. Hope the third time will be the charm or we will have to find a different game.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book quickly turns out to be a love story.<br />You cant wait to see is Ana will live happily ever after
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This like so many HBO series does not disappoint, my only qualm is that A) the second season isn't due to release until Feb 19th 2013 so i have to wait a month which sucks because i'm thirsting for more and B) the item shows a map of the land which I did not receive with this box set, it does have quite an extensive history in the dvd features however and you can read about each house and each member within that house. Still gets a 5 star despite the absent map
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I thought some of the fight sequences were a little hard to believe.  But all in all, the book was an enjoyable read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved the book. I want expecting it to be like that. Definitely a shocker for what happened. Now onto book three.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Just got this yesterday and have been listening to it nonstop! I loved Diamond Eyes and was wondering how good this one would be considering the short amount of time between the two, but this one delivers. Leathers, Goon Squad, and Poltergeist make me look at tour dates to see when I could see these songs played live, while Entombed and What Happened to You? are slower paced, dare I say romantic(?) tracks comparable to Diamond Eyes' Sextape. Definitely a must have for alt metal lovers.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This works great for my new iPhone 5, but I have an otter box and the tripod doesn't fit the size of the otter box without taking the phone outside the case. Other than that it works great so far
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a good game because it brings out the creation.but the only thing that I have trouble with is joining other people.but that's pretty much the only thing that I have trouble with.l have it for the Xbox 360 edition that's pretty good also because it just has just a l little more blocks but I'm sure that the game mite update soon.The only thing they should update is REDSTONE I mean why is it even in it. That's about all keep up the good work Mojang and 4J studios and all the other sponsors for minecraft.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I've been an Aerosmith fan since the mid 80's. I was not old enough to enjoy their old stuff from the seventies at the time, but in the 80's, I started to become a fan of their seventies music. I have Rocks, Toy's in the Attic, Night in the Ruts, Aerosmith, and Get Your Wings.  I also have all their 80's, 90's, and '00's music. I'm a big Aerosmith fan. The only albums that I do not like are Rock in a Hard Place, Done with Mirrors, and Just Push Play. Although, Just Push Play did have some good tunes, but overall not that good.<br /><br />This album is good. The only songs that I do not like are Joe Perry's songs.  Why do they let him sing? Because he can't and his songs aren't any good. The rest of the songs are good and some are even great. Take out the two Joe Perry's songs and you have a good not great but good album. Some of the best songs on the album are Beautiful, Out Go the Lights, Legendary Child, What Could Have Been Love, Street Jesus, We All Fall Down, and Another Last Goodbye. The rest  are not bad. Take Joe Perry's crap songs off and you have a 4 out of 5 star rating. This is one opinion from a Aerosmith fan.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The  cover itself is very good, practically indestructible. It really provides a great protection for my kindle. Unfortunately the elastic band that secures the cover looses its elasticity pretty soon.
1442419814|3.0|I still can't decide how I feel about Uglies. I finished it a day or two ago, but I find that when I think about it, a riot of emotion just overwhelms me. I'm a big ball of worry, sadness, disgust, curiosity, hopefulness, admiration, and a couple of other feelings. (Notice how I didn't include happy on my list. There's a reason for that and I'll talk about it in a bit.)<br /><br />Uglies is another spectacular dystopian novel, and reading it has increased my love for this particular genre. Scott Westerfeld created a world that was both realistic and surreal all at once, simply using a concept that modern day society makes a big deal out of - beauty. It literally took my breath away how he managed to wrangle this concept into something so seemingly definable, and how he used it to delineate between what kind of people the characters were. His writing is masterful and, best of all, I loved that it made me reflect and think about things I never would have thought about.<br /><br />Final verdict: This book is another brilliant dystopian novel, and personally, it definitely lived up to its hype. It also made me think a lot about beauty and society's pressure for a certain kind of beauty to prevail amongst all others - and that definitely made my mind whirl. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Pretties.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great way to get started with series. We watched both seasons in about a week and a half.  Really love Downton.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such an awesome twist - I love it when I'm surprised!  The story sucks you in and it's so hard to put it down!  I wish it never ended.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|An electronic version of a classic, now in electronic form, for the kindle. The presentation, typeface and general appearance was very good.
0375842209|5.0|I started The Book Thief with the knowledge that I was beginning a book with a reputation that preceded it - a book that had left a very strong impression on those who had read it. While it took a while for me get into the writing style, I fell head over heels in love with this story. It's powerful and moving and beautiful and inspiring, and serves as a reminder of why I want to write stories. Though I'm almost certain that my review will be inadequate to express how amazing this book is, I sure want to try to tell you why I love it so.<br /><br />First, there are these incredible characters. This story is filled to the brim with characters, both primary and secondary, that play a part in the constantly shifting, weaving storyline. Death narrates this story, and while I thought that was peculiar at first, I have come to realize that it was a wonderfully unique way of telling this story. Death, obviously, is not emotionally attached to these people, but he is fascinated by them and interested in them and eager to share what he knows with us about Liesel and her life.<br /><br />Liesel is a character that I just wanted to hug and hand cookies and books to. She endures a lot of hardship at such a young age - death and hunger and pain and ostracizing - and yet, she still manages to have an indomitable, strong spirit. I admired her courage when faced with scary or new situations, her tenacity and desire to read and read and read, and her unquestionable loyalty and love for the ones she loves.<br /><br />And, obviously, I think the fact that she wanted all of the books was something I could definitely relate to! The books, in fact, are what serve as the cornerstone for the beginnings of her relationship with her foster father Hans and Max, the Jew that they hide in the basement. Hans teaches Liesel to read and to recognize words, and the intimacy and sweetness of their father-daughter relationship just brought me to tears every single time. With Max on the other hand, the words were something that they ended up clinging to as their common ground. Words unite them, words are a language they both know and words prove to be an incredibly significant part of their lives.<br /><br />Then, there's the story. I say this all the time, and after reading this book, I am convinced that it is truer than ever - words have power. We see this evidenced time and again throughout the story, and each time there was a new example of it, I could feel my heart swell.<br /><br />The relationships between the characters, the historical facts and musings tossed in, the descriptions of the settings and the people and the world at that time - all of it was impeccably written. I seriously find myself thinking about Adolf Hitler and the history of that time, and marveling at the fact that this (fictional) opinion of him is something that I can truly agree with. This story is a collection of beautifully curated prose, with carefully chosen words, and I closed the cover feeling like I had gone through a tremendously moving journey.<br /><br />It is fairly obvious that I loved this book. While it's certainly not the easiest story to read (and not just because it's fairly lengthy), I can assure you that I truly believe it is worth it. The finesse and the cleverness with which the author wielded his words certainly made an impression on me - and that impression implores me to recommend that you read this book. If you're hesitating or if you've been on the edge or if you've been putting it off, consider this review an invitation to finally allow yourself to be immersed in a story that will touch your heart and make you think.y ended up clinging to as their common ground.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and would reccommend it to anyone who likes a bit of mystery coupled with fun puzzles.
0545259096|5.0|The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy is the first ever series about werewolves I read (and to think, I just picked Linger up by accident at the Fully Booked store in the Philippines - a happily serendipitous event!). From the very beginning, I've been in love with the series and enjoyed delving into the world that Maggie Stiefvater has expertly crafted.<br /><br />As a fan of the series, I thought that the final installment was incredibly satisfying, especially with regards to the climax and how things came to an end. I loved getting to read about all my favorite characters (Cole and Sam are obviously the ones I'm talking about, as much as I like Isabel and Grace) one last time and to see how each of their personal journeys sort of reached an end. I was quite sad to turn the last page of the book actually, as I no longer had any more adventures with the wolves of Mercy Falls to look forward to.<br /><br />I think what bothered me a little bit was how slow-paced some parts of the book seemed to be. Then again, that might be a personal opinion, as I'm naturally impatient and I was so invested in these characters that I just wanted to see what was going to happen to them next! In retrospect, maybe including those slow-paced parts was a deliberate way of making the action-packed bits more exciting because that's definitely what happened to me.<br /><br />Maggie once again succeeds in bringing alive the town of Mercy Falls and the world of the wolves - and I was thoroughly enchanted. The series is definitely one of my personal favorites, so there's no doubt that I mean it when I say I recommend it.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|I would encourage everyone to read this book.<br />It was engaging and clever both in story and character development.<br />If The Night Circus did exist, I would have been there with my red scarf.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Relationships fascinate me. How do people come together and stay together?<br />This book is how they do it.<br />Once the real relationship starts, it is a choice to be there.<br />It is as simply as not being selfish. Choose to do things that fill their love tank and they will do the same for you.<br />Never do anything for the person you love with the expectation of reciprocation.<br /><br />Truly learned so much about myself and well as my husband.<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone, whether you are happy in a relationship or not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game rocks! Its so realistic and it makes me so happy to finally have a pet horse:) BUT i wish some items weren't so expensive.
B009186E3O|5.0|This box is a must have item for every big Stones fan. The  movie itself is astonishing, insightful and hilarious. I have already watched it twice and I'm planning a third viewing. The backstage footage offers incredibly candid moments with Mick and Keith in their formative years as songwriters and having a little fun at the expense of the Beatles and Elvis. Priceless. The extras such as the live CD and CD soundtrack of the movie make the box worth having instead of just buying a DVD of the film.
B000JMKSE2|5.0|The Longer Long Tail is a great explanation of technology enabling new possibilities of commerce via distribution channels that were once not profitable. Chris Anderson does a tremendous job of explaining the concept of distribution tails and what they mean to the way marketers may change their way of selling to consumers. Traditional retail employed Pareto's Rule of 20% accounting for 80% of the results, or in this case, the sales. The commercial medium of the internet has shifted this paradigm of retailing, allowing for expanded distribution of products to very large audiences.<br /><br />Not only has the concept of long tail distributions taken hold in electronic medium (e.g. Amazon and Netflix) but new physical merchandising opportunities in niche markets have become more prevalent (e.g. Anheuser Bush expansion into craft beers). This is an interesting and useful read for any marketer.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|2012 was a pretty big year for Linkin Park. All Star tour with Incubus, Burn It Down used in the 2012 NBA Playoffs... Then Living Things. Lost In The Echo is a straight classic. Mike Shinoda is one of my favorite rappers and I hope he does another Fort Minor project in the near future.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|I was kind of surprised that I liked it as much as I did since it didn't have Matt Damon in it. It refered back to him along with a scene or two showing his picture but movie was very well thought out and well acted, only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz I do miss Matt in it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is fun and teaches focus, slowness, and concentration. Most games today you need to be quick, this one you need to slow down to play. Some parts are fast, not trying to say it is slow. Fantastic graphics too! Just wish it had more levels. Hopefully they will add some more levels in the future. The price was the only negative part of it with the amount levels, but I still give it a 5 star rating overall.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman is an acquired taste, but a pretty darned good writer when it comes to explain economic theory to a layperson.  In person, Krugman is a truly odd duck, but his writing shields the reader from his personal flukes and ticks.  People who read this book for the purpose of learning will either love it or hate it, but in either case, the reader will go away having learned a lot about the whys, wherefores, and possible solutions to our economic problems.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite video and book to read. Disney version brings it to life and draws into the storyline. Jim Carrery's voice is awesome & believable as Scrooge. I truly enjoyed it and will watch over & over.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|While travelling, this app has helped me zone out and get to sleep dozens of times. I've sampled a half-dozen sleep/noise/relax apps, and this is tied for first place in my mind (up there with Relax Melodies). Surprised to see it as a free-app-of-the-day, as it is well worth a few bucks.
B007PFDJH4|4.0|I waffled on how I felt about this book once i finished reading it.  I thoroughly enjoyed McEwan's typically delightful prose and story telling, but felt disappointed by what felt like a somewhat rushed ending foisted upon him by some editor.  I won't reveal the end twist, but I recall reading it and thinking, &#34;Oh, Ian, you could have done better.&#34;
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I am a political junkie and have read many books on presidents and politics.  In spite of that reading, I was amazed by the revelations within this book.  I strongly recommend the book to anyone interested.  One thing I do know, the presidency is a daunting job that almost NONE of (those that were covered) the occupants of the job have not screwed up, at least in the beginning.  I think this book will allow the more harsh critics to be more empathetic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game where you use hour survival skills and are put to the test to survive. There are monsters like zombies, skeletons, spiders and piculiar monsters called creepers that blow up in you're face. Skeletons shoot you with a bow and arrows, zombies hit you on the head, spiders bite you and creepers, as I've told you before blow up in your face.

B0070YDOT8|3.0|Find the games ok for short play.  I like Bounus rounds and dont like these games that pay very little not even cover your min bet.  I know this is a ploy to get us to buy tokens but not very engaging for me. One game (racing cars) does have a bonus but would not spin when hitting spin button.......
B0001I562I|4.0|Take yourself back to when you were a kid. Did you not want to explore new realms and be that &#34;Take Charge kin of guy?&#34;<br />This movie should be in any Disney collectors library.<br /><br />This is one of those movies the whole family will enjoy; Except for the girls as this is no chick-flick film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is amazingly great way to improve the first one and not make it the same. has so many great new features definiently buy if you like Tempe run1
B0063GORYU|5.0|What a fun, addictive game! Half the time I stay up playing long after I should be in bed sleeping.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I saw in 2012.  The book was near perfect, and writer/director Steven Chbosky did a great job of transferring his novel to the screen.  I honestly think this film should have been up for best adapted screenplay.  The performances turned in by the young actors were nothing short of jaw dropping.  If you can't relate to these kids, then you must have been in the \\"in-crowd\\" in high school, because I saw my friends and myself in every frame of this movie.  I bought the digital release the second it hit Amazon. It's a movie I plan to watch many times in the coming years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! I recommend this game for anyone!!! This game is fun for all ages I can't believe how realistic this game is....I give it 800 star's if I could.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Quite simply the best book I've read in a very long time. This is the first book I've read by this author, but it won't be my last.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is the best book I've read regarding that area.  I was around at that time.  Told my son about it and he is reading it and thoroughly enjoying it.  The author researched this book well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to everyone interested in the history of our country.
0891419195|5.0|From boot camp through the horrible battles on Peleliu and Okinawa, this book brings home the cost of war on those who fought it. Anyone who has a relative who has seen combat will understand their experience so much better after reading this.

B002RI9UBS|5.0|I had already read this previously, but wanted to reread it before watching the movie. It is an amazing book with an amazing story. Thought provoking and beautiful. I would recommend everyone to read this.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|When someone says that an author should be able to catch its readers from the first lines, the first chapter or he risks losing them forever, Colleen Hoover should stay safe with her opening in \\"Hopeless\\" ...<br />From the first agitated encounter with Sky, full of strong emotions, it's what prompted me to read this story. Then during all my read, I ceased to remember this passage on to guess what could possibly happen between Sky and Holder to make her cry and make him says: \\"You need to leave. Now\\".<br /><br />I imagined various scenarios. The author has toyed with me by surfing into the breach of my hypotheses before sending me to the mat with its unexpected twists. I almost loved my quest as much as  the truth finding behind this introduction that the story itself.<br /><br />The characters are funny, strong, amazing. The story begins like a first love that has to see beyond the rumors and appearances to blossom but it quickly becomes something darker.<br />Emotions are violent, passionate, almost terrifying by their intensity. There is also the softness, beauty of the love bubble created by the two heroes. Then, in the course of events, we realize that we are dealing with adults as these teens are almost too mature for their age. They are children obliged  to grow up too fast because of the hard experiences encountered. That makes them heart-piercing.<br /><br />The plot is powerful and tragic. Words are inventive. Emotions are striking. The characters are intriguing  with all their secrets. But I was swept off my feet by the rightness of the different reactions and emotions. The mix of vulnerability and strength that echoes the reality of every human being and that the author has been very successfully transcribe.<br /><br />I admit that the ability to forgive and move forward of the two heroes seemed too good to be true. The events are so traumatic so I've kind of found it difficult to process like Sky did. But I admire her the strength. I also like the positivity of the messages sent by Collen Hoover through the different characters whose circumstances are not the easiest.<br /><br />Perhaps, I would have wished Brecklin to be more present as his few appearances have amused me quite a lot.<br /><br />I devoured this novel in one night. I loved it.<br /><br />A wonderful surprise.<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr/

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Did not enjoy this book at all, and will cross Colleen Hoover off my list.<br />Is childish all about kids.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|The Death Cure is an amazing end to an already amazing series. The story has anything and everything a good book needs, like a good plot and twists and turns to keep you on your toes.
6305428298|4.0|If you believe the myth that the British are polite and reserved -- ha!  This wild movie will make you realize otherwise!  In fact, there are times that the loud and raucous characters are so over-the-top that it might be too much for some viewers.  The vehicle showcases the wonderful talents of the main characters:  Brenda Blethyn, Jim Broadbent, Michael Caine, Jane Horrocks, Ewan McGregor, and an excellent line-up of supporting cast members.  These excellent actors take you on a ride of extremes:  from rough and hard-edged, to poignant and lyric vulnerability.  Have fun!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|this movie was aweful. i love brad but i just couldnt get into this movie at all. bummer cause i love all his other movies
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It's a good book up in till the twist and then the end sucks. if the ending was different I think it would be a very good book.
1416575464|5.0|The magazine was the best. Seriously. It was a sad day when they announced that they were closing up and I started getting Glamour in the mail to replace them. This book has many of the beautiful images and ideals from some of my favorite editions. I'd buy another volume if they ever came out with one.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I enjoyed the game and was having fun playing it.  But it is no longer in my phone.  I could nit find a way to fully turn it off.  It kept running partially in the background, even after I STOPPED it.  So it had to go.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Looooooooved this book. Best book of read in a year. This is some psycho stuff right here but it reminds me so much of real life. All pretend. Yup. Lol but she won in the end. Wow. Great story. I will recommend this book to everyone, no matter what kind of books they like to read.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We are serious HP enthusiasts, but could not afford the complete, extended collection. This one includes just the 8 actual movies, without all the bonus features that you might find on a collectors edition. But the price was unbeatable.
0765325950|5.0|I got into this series when I was a junior in high school. I started reading The Eye of the World when it was in softback form, there were no other books written yet. So it has been a 20 year wait to get to the conclusion of the series. It was sad when Mr. Jordan died, but I was glad when Mr. Sanderson took up where Jordan left off.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love this game but twice it has deleted my progress I had a score that was over a million points and tons of coins and the Radios all collected gone now and no way to get it back so get the game if you want to work hard at getting everything yo have it tooken away.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Harry Hole is a great character, the supporting cast is very good as well and the story is excellent. Recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game on earth. Its even way better than the first. Its got better definition, its got new upgrades, more things you do, and just very fun. I highly recommend you getting this game, it is fun for all ages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was recommended by my friend. What a great story!  I loved Sky and Dean. I felt as if I was with them each step of the way. This story has a lot of surprises. I loved the twist and turns and that I had no idea what was going to happen next.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The main issue I usually have with this kind of game is that it ends too quickly, this game however took hours and I really enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next one!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|So ... tired.... must... write....review.... stayed up late... finishing book.... but seriously. this is awesome. I'm trying to be very stingy with the 5 stars, but this deserves it. It blew my hair back. First: I'm all about the fae and the magic. Of course, dummy here spent their first 3/4 of the book confusing druid with dryad....then I remembered.... them what built the stonehenge! ok, that's not right either, but you know. It was a religion and all. And it was late. And I'm under pressure to finish these library books. Even with my fae creatures confused, I loved the heck out of this.<br /><br />As for the review. Read it. If you love the intermixing of the magical with the mundane, people turning into animals, you love action in your fantasy, gods, goddesses, and/or if you've ever wished to converse with a gigantic Irish wolfhound. This book has all that, and the best part? It's one of those where you feel like you just fall through the pages and into the story and you just want to stay there. The author tells you a story, he doesn't try to whack you over the head or impress you with all the research he did. That said, I learned so much about gods and goddesses whose names I had only come across reading the occasional myth and legend. It's like he grabs these somewhat obscure legends and gods and makes them his own. And when he does inform you about something you need to understand, he does it quickly, and blends it into the story in just the right place. He doesn't stop the action to give you a low-down on the pantheon of all the gods and their places.... that would take forever.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it is tiny, is that all this leaves you a little breathless. One thing after another, there is very little downtime and he hits you with a lot of characters at the beginning. But it kept me turning pages and gave me a satisfying ending. I got the first three books together from the library. I am opening the next book in the series tonight.
B005R32L66|5.0|This made my tablet more useful than I ever expected.  If you view it horizontal though your &#34;send&#34; picture is sideways.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is the best remote desktop app I have found for tablets. It is fast, has a nice trackpad mode, and is easy to set up. The only improvement I wish they would make is to give more options for the resolution.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|If you're a victim of sexual abuse, I urge you to either steer clear of this one, or brace yourself. There are parts of this book that are hard to read, honestly, especially because you can see what is happening before the main character even realises it. That said, in terms of an honest depiction of pain, it's very well written and thoroughly engaging. The main characters are honest and captivating.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The greatest aspect of this program is that some of it appears to work even when you can't get a wi-fi connection
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book sucks you into a world that could be our near future. The movie dose not do this book justice I'm glad I finally broke down and read it. I read all the books in lead than a week I could not put them down.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|great having 90 min. of some of the best Eighties music in your face. surprisingly well cast and very funny. Cruise nails the part of train wreck rock star. Jones' performance as the tight assed puritan is a standout. Baldwin and Brand are hysterical. tease up the hair and enjoy!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Nice work with the details that made the adventure possible in ridding the world<br />of one of the #1 criminal minds.  The move Zero Dark 30 followed the book very closely.<br />Good stuff.  Worth reading.
B000BYRCGU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It didn't receive the ratings and publicity it deserved when it first debuted. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves the beach, action moves, or Paul Walker with his shirt off. The movie arrived in perfect condition.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|My son is a Batman fan.  I have been a fan for over 40 yrs.  This movie was slow a the beginning, but quickly moved along in the middle.  Christian Bale was a great choice for Batman
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Real characters that live, grow and die horribly.<br />Enormous world with more story lines then you can wield a bastard sword at, that you can just tell are all going to come together with a flash of dragon flame in the end.<br />Did I mention Dragons?
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's great you can see any word you need. I would recommend this but everybody who gets a kindle fire already has it :P
B005MMY5RK|5.0|We watched this again since it has been many yrs since high school.  Great movie making, and I really appreciate the messages throughout the movie.  A must see for This generation of children
B008AYA7WE|3.0|This is a basic bible which serves the purpose of simply reading. i desire to read with understanding and because of how old the bible is it takes a concordence to understand intent and purpose multiple words and this app did not offer that.
B008NF45S2|5.0|Once I determined that this app was not designed to work with my network printer, I set it up as a shared<br />printer, it works just right. A very nice layout, well configured app.  Very user friendly<br />Thanks You.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works great for the computer and also works great for the Krindle Fire. The app manager lets you see what is running and shut down programs that freeze quickly.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Had some issues with my tablet charger and Amazon CS sent this as a remedy with the plug for the outlet and even though the issue was with the tablet the cable works great...
B008CIUS72|2.0|I must reiterate........What does this app do?<br />I couldn't make sense of it, the help instructions were of no help either.
B0018BB20W|5.0|&#34;Days Of Future Passed&#34;  is a rock and roll symphony.  Two songs stand out:  &#34;Tuesday Afternoon&#34;  and  &#34;Nights In White Satin.&#34;
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this shortly after it came out... I can't get enough... Being a Hugh Star Wars fan and love playing Angry Birds this was a no brainer...  can't wait for episode 2 :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was never bored reading this book or the other two books for that matter.  There are a lot of sad parts but it kept me guessing and it ended with what I think considering everything Katniss went through a good ending for her and Peeta.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a grate idea and who ever thought of it are vary kind and so clever thanks.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I LOVE THE RED TAILS I WENT TO THE MOVIES THREE TIMES ON THE BIG SCREEN.  I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME.  THE BLACK FLYERS IF WE WOULD HAVE KNOEN ALOT EARLIER ABOUT THE SUPPORT OF GIGHTERS WE WOULD HAVE SAVED MANY THOUSANDS OF LIVES.  MY UNCLE GOT SHOT DOWN IN SECOND WORLD WAR.  HE SURVIVED THAN GOD.  THEY HAD OVER THE YEARS GOT HIPS LEGS AND FEET.  THANKS. ALLEN
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Mostly action and explosions, little plot line and convoluted story-telling that I expect from a Mission Impossible movie (then again, I compare it to the first movie that came out in '96). For entertainment value, it's a good movie with special effects and scenes that made me gasp. As for plot, eh, you don't watch this for plot.
B00004TS0E|3.0|I DIDN'T LIKE IT AS I WANTED FULL SCREEN LIKE THEY HAVE IT ON VHS TAPE.  I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN ON ANY MOVIE ALLEN
B004LROMQG|4.0|Third season has the same comedic, tender, dramatic moments as the previous two seasons, but this time with more special effects and the sense of impending doom. It's a tv series, so there are some plot gaps, cliche moments, and repetition that I have to ignore or then I wouldn't be able to enjoy the show. Bradley James, Colin Morgan, Angel Coulby, and Anthony Head again are impeccable, while I'm not so sure what is going on with Katie McGrath. She's not a bad actress, but I question the exhaustive use of evil smirks. Could just be a comedic gimmick that an American (well, at least this American) doesn't understand.
B00005JK8K|5.0|I WANTED TO GET WINDTALKERS AS TO PRESERVE IT FOR FUTURE USE.  I HAVE IT ON VHS.  BUT IT IS CLEARER ON DVD.  THANKYOU
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It wont let me play than to make it worse I had to delete it to see if that would help but noooo now I cant redownload this stupid game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I love this case it is durable and functions very well. I am very pleased with the quality of it too
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love the tunes on this CD. Ms Clarkson is great at what she does. I would tell others about this CD.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Stayed up way to late reading this book ever night!  Great book, perhaps a second one will soon be available?!?
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|At first I was disppointed because I thought with a title like December it would have been Christmas tunes. I love this CD.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Praise for this continuation of the Downton Abbey spectacular. Fine plots and subplots, twists, turns -- unexpected but delightful character developments. A great moment in entertainment.
B00008G8LG|5.0|They just do not make movies like this any more!  Supurb!!  Lead actors are captivating and the setting is amazing. DVD arrived in perfect condition.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|Well build and a good value if your RIGHT HANDED, beware lefties it says its ambidextrous i found it not to be so lefty friendly. I sent this back and ordered their CM recon from amazon and that is truly ambidextrous
B00ARN0WBW|4.0|Very fun movie, was frighted a few times.<br />Hard to keep popcorn in the bowl, when I was throwing it in the air every few minutes. HEHE!
0345803507|5.0|Love these books - great read for a housewife!<br /><br />You have to read the complete set - get all three!
1550379151|5.0|The Paper Bag Princess 25th Anniversary Edition is two gifts in one as it provides the story behind the story as well as the wonderful picture book itself.  Every time I read the book I remember why it is my favorite book to give to girls, but it was an early book used to introduced my sons to the idea that gender doesn't matter when it comes to doing the right thing.
0345803493|5.0|Love these books - great read for a housewife!<br /><br />You have to read the complete set - get all three!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the fact there are things you can do, coins and jewels to earn, and jobs to perform without having to actually spend money or return to the game within a certain amount of time. I work a job with fluctuating hours, so I can leave the horse for several hours and not have to worry about returning to find it dead. fun to play and easy to pick up and put down
B008YU0AOE|5.0|i love this on my kindle. its super big and is great for what i need it for. the numbers are easy to see and to understand.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|All the nevosoft games are first rate. I play this game over and over. Really look forward to whatever else they may come up with.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|One of the best written stories I have ever read about the lives of all the people who had to endure the horrors of the Second World War and the spread of fascism and nazism around the globe, with its impact changing the course of the world order forever. Follet's best book so far, in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a wonderful and fun game to play. I would play this game any where and that is exactly what I do!!
B000BL39G0|3.0|Thought i was getting both cds didn't realize it was going to be just the first one, i have the first one that's why i bought it for the second one. Cant go wrong with a 2pac cd, just not what i expected.
B00170GYB6|5.0|This movie is great and highly underrated.It's full of great action and some really funny comedy as well.It may not be Arnold's best,but this movie is not to be taken seriously.Overall,if you are a fan of Arnold's or like a good action/comedy then you will love this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game, kinda sucks how many points you have to get to unlock more but I really enjoy that there are so many different games in one.
B000002IST|5.0|I can't believe some of the negative reviews that this album has gotten on here.\\"We Can't Dance\\" is a classic 1991 album.The songs on here are very good,and there is a great meaning to them all.\\"No Son Of Mine\\",\\"Jesus He Knows Me\\",\\"I Can't Dance\\",\\"Driving The Last Spike\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\" are truly some of the best songs that Genesis has ever recorded.Overall,if you love good music,then you will love this album as much as I do.Every song on here is a winner!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keeps you on the very edge of your seat the whole time you are reading this. This book is so suspenseful. Oh my, I could go on for days about this book. It is a must read!<br />WARNING: You will not be able to put this book down.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It is a very entertaining movie! A must see.  It is for the young at heart.  Enjoy this movie many years to come.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Bought a ton of older movies for my niece. A childhood without Goonies, Labyrinth, Short Circuit, and the like would not be a complete childhood (plus I would be remiss as an uncle)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app! It works on my tablet (Coby Kyros Android)! I love horses, and this is one of the best horses apps I have! It is free, so get it and try it out!!!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|The movie features some classic rock music from the '80s. However, it seems to really have a hard time finding a good story line.  This seems to be primarily a vehicle to showcase the music.<br /><br />Tom Cruise does a decent job in playing his character. Not bad in his singing either.<br /><br />Worth a watch if you are not expecting too much.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's tons of fun!! Play all day! It's fun for any age. It also teaches kids how the world kind of works
B008HT4FUW|2.0|First off, this isn't a review for the TV show. Anyone with a brain knows that the show is a solid 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. My review is for [[ASIN:B008HT4FUW this particular]] DVD set.<br /><br />The pro is that you can get all of series 1 and 2 as well as the Christmas Special for one low price. There are a few select extras without any commentaries and that is about all.<br /><br />I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, or if all are made the same way, but I was exceptionally disappointed as I watched the show. All of series 1 and parts of series 2 have serious color issues. Everyone's faces look so pale and sickly with red splotches all over their skin. It looks like everyone has the measles.<br /><br />Now I will admit that I have a [[ASIN:B006U1YVZ8 new blu-ray player]] (which I love). However, I do not have this problem with other blu-ray discs. On the other hand, I have a very limited number of blu-ray discs since I'm just now getting into the blu-ray world.<br /><br />I'm reminded of the quality of the Pride and Prejudice DVD set that I bought as soon as it was first released on regular DVD (post the VHS world). It too had color wash out issues.<br /><br />Also, I am so disappointed in the lack of blu-ray features in this set. For Christmas, my husband bought me [[ASIN:B008DCAG9M this set]] along with the new blu-ray player. Maybe it was a bad set to start with, but it has such interesting features! One clever one is saving your favorite parts of the films. My assumption was that this was a standard, but perhaps not. Either way, I wish that a series so great as this one would have taken the time to infuse rich features like the Hitchcock set.<br /><br />It's worth noting too that if you purchase the separate series blu-rays ([[ASIN:B004FM2ENU this one]] and [[ASIN:B005Q1W0ZQ this one]]), you'll likely (at present in any case) get a complimentary digital copy of the series via Amazon's Video Library. I actually bought them first, then cancelled those in lieu of this set. I'm very much regretting that decision now. This set does NOT come with a free video library copy.<br /><br />All in all, I'm gravely disappointed. Because it is a blu-ray I expected quality HD and that was what I did not get. The final disc worked fine, but not the others. Well, you get what you pay for, I guess.lieu of this set. I'm very much regretting that decision now. This set does NOT come with a free video library copy.<br /><br />All in all, I'm gravely disappointed. Because it is a blu-ray I expected quality HD and that was what I did not get.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Does anyone not like Big Bang? Einstien would approve, Bohrs would love it, Galileo would be star struck! And Spock....we all know he watches every episode.  Thats why I do too.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I like this as a second controller but for some reason I can't get it to stay on all the time while I'm trying to recharge it. It seems to have an automatic 10 minute shut off no matter what I do. I've been in my PS3 Power Saver a lot trying to change this to &#34;off&#34; for the shutdown to no avail. Still, it's good enough to use short term until the other one recharges...
0312430000|5.0|This is really an amazing book.  At first I thought, 'a book on checklists??'  I mean, what could be simpler?  But the author really digs deep with insightful stories and experiences, showing us that there's more to a checklist than a column of check boxes.  It's about empowering people, turning our tendency to rush after the exciting, and the importance of simple innovation.  A tip: I'm not good with hospitals and this book does contain some stories that offer more detail than I'm comfortable with, but I pushed through them and learned a lot - so you can too.  Just a little warning helps!<br /><br />Please, read this book
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I purchased this and one other Bruno Mars album as a gift for my (over 60) wife and she loves it. She moves it from one car to the other depending on which one she's driving for the day. I'm a big fan too but my radio is on most of the time in my van. Definitely a good gift for the music lover in your family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story is beautifully written and goes by way too quickly.  I was thinking about the characters whenever I put the book down, and finished it sooner than I wanted, though I *had* to know how the story ended.  It was a wonderful dilemma as a reader, and rarely do you get that chance to enjoy a book so much you hate for it to end.<br /><br />I laughed and cried my way through this book and am amazed my Kindle still works despite the amount of tears it collected.  Poignant and wonderful.  A great book club book, too.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the interplay between the classes.  The characters are complicated, not simply two dimensional stereotypes.  The period dress and atmosphere are charming.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a really good book great for kids. don't take any lessons from Greg. I loved the book Jeff Kinney is really good author
0425252868|5.0|Just finished reading what has to be one of the best books ever written about WWII and the sacrifices made by those on either side of the battle.  A Higher Call tells a great story of sacrifice, bravery and personal fellowship among aviators.  As someone who has spent many hours reading Luftwaffe histories, I really enjoyed the personal insight into some of the Luftwaffe personalities.  The final chapters brought happy tears and a feeling of pride regarding these hero's of WWII.  May God Bless Their Souls.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't finish the book because the movie came out. but the first four chapters are already good she is really good at describing the details
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So happy with this option of viewing Downtown Abbey instead of having to wait for a month and it's a great show!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Not A Bad App.. Wish I Had ThIs When I Was Out of Town Recently.  It Would Have Saved Me A Trip To The Store Trying to find A Small Fan In The Winter!
B009JZPH32|5.0|Great story, great actors, and Oliver Stone... What's not to like. It had me from the beginning right to the end... GLUED
B003VANOFY|3.0|It works great if I only use it for a couple hours max, but after that it'll start turning off randomly and it will rarely make this horrible screeching noise. I've searched online and it seems its a semi-common issue with them. I would not buy these again.
B0050IY61G|5.0|This is a very thorough book on Asperper's Syndrome.  It covers most aspects of the syndrome and questions that one might have about it.  I bought it because I am in a relationship with someone I suspect has Asperger's.  The book helped me understand and deal with aspects of my relationship that were puzzling.  Now that I have a better understanding, I am able to allow him to be himself.  Being a teacher as well, I think this book is must for teachers who deal with these children all the time. So helpful and thorough.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|If you are a collector you must have it! Another good edition of one of the best DC character. Wonderful.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. The story was very riveting and thought provoking. It touched on many hot button topics. I enjoyed the pace of the story - how it went between past and present to weave all the pieces together. Can't wait to get started on the next book!
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|A great single album, if you love James Bond and you are a collector, you must have it. Listen it!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great read especially for history buffs and romantics alike.  This is a must read to anyone who read Book 1.
B003ODL004|5.0|One of the best composer, one of the best movie and one of the best soundtrack. AMAZING!!! Hans Zimmer Rules!!!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was really easy to read even though it took about a week<br />Hamster dance is out peeps and people
B009FBX5M0|5.0|A great soundtrack of a great movie. James Bond Rules!!! I really love James Bond and the music too!!! Listen it!!!
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|This book was OK I was having a hard time getting into it so I expect the next one to really grab me in
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the horses but I don't think you should have unicorns there not real even if your a little girl
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Is not the best app to play around with.  It is hard to draw on the kindle with your fingers
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This one is especially nice because you don't have to keep buying things to continue playing! Thank you to the developers for this fun game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think I am a little bit old to still be playing with horses, but it is just so much fun!
B004LROMSO|4.0|This was a great series that was unfortunately cancelled after the first season.  Don't let that stop you from watching it.  It's quite well done.  The sets, costumes, script and actors are all top notch.  The production quality is very high.  While the ratings weren't bad for the show, I believe it was cancelled for two reasons:  1.)  Period dramas are VERY expensive to produce.  Showtime was struggling in the last two seasons of The Tudors just to continue the series' budget.  So, I can imagine what Starz was paying for this per episode.  2.)  This good show had the misfortune of premiering in the exact same season as the MUCH inferior, Game of Thrones on HBO, which seemed to steal it's thunder.<br /><br />Even so, I highly recommend this series, especially if you enjoyed The Tudors.  I could tell immediately from the production values, style of the presentation and even the writing that someone from The Tudors had to be involved with this production.  In fact, they are.  Michael Hirst, who created and executive produced The Tudors does so here.  The look and feel is very much the same.  Even the casting personnel are the same.<br /><br />Eva Green is fantastic as Morgan Le Fey as is most everyone else.  My only two gripes are unfortunately actors in the two biggest parts.  Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is just okay.  I realize Arthur is a reluctant boy-King, but they really needed to get someone with more GRAVITAS, especially when Arthur assumes the throne and really needs to display some balls.  The entire show revolves around him.  Someone like Jonathan Rhys Myers could carry the Tudors.  Bower can't do the same for Camelot.  Joseph Fiennes, as Merlin is strangely irritating.  For nearly the first entire season, he wears the SAME scowl on his face.  It NEVER changes.  His performance isn't okay.  It's disappointing.  I was surprised because he's a very good actor...just not in this part...in my opinion.  Who knows how he would have evolved it over the course of 3-4 seasons.  We'll never know, but in this season...Merlin has a stick up his butt the entire time making him very, very unlikable.<br /><br />The locations are lush.  It's shot in British Columbia, as was The Tudors.  If Feinnes had been better, I'd have given this a 5-star, and made due with Bower's lackluster Arthur.  Even so...it's a solid 4.
0062124293|5.0|Great read, drags a bit in the beginning but it is still wonderful!  Great for a laugh and insight on beinging a woman!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I am not a very good puzzler, so I was reluctant to purchase a puzzle for my kindle. A friend recommended it, so I did. Well it is a quick and pleasant game which I enjoy. Even I can solve the puzzle in the beginner section!
B009MO57H6|5.0|milla is my fav hero and this series is one of my favs maybe not the best in the series but im still pretty pleased as it sets up the next one pretty well i just hope they take it farther
B000CQO0WQ|5.0|I chose my rating because it is one of the greatest and most underrated albums of all time. It came out in 95 but still holds it own. The service was excellent and the product arrived early.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|couldnt pass up the price- gave the other boxed set i had to st vinnys to give someone a great christmas gift
B008I2OAEE|5.0|The album arrived on time and in perfect condition.Plus it was another great offering from the Gathering and to get it early and in perfect condition made my day.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book in this trilogy was indeed better than the first. I gave it four stars, though, because there were so many new characters introduced that it was easy to get confused.  It had so many twists, too, that you may need to either take some notes or read it as quickly as possible! It truly held my attention, however, and had me second guessing every character's intentions by the time I finished reading. Can't wait to pick up the next one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really fun and enjoyable. I loved this game. I would recommend this game to any horse lovers. also to people who wish for a horse but would never really be able to afford them. also it is just fun to play and kind of addicting.
1401922732|5.0|Very positive cards i get very accurate readings! :)<br /><br />The cards are very beautiful and the guidebook is very helpful
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A suspenseful novel that kept me entertained from start to finish!  I can't wait to read the next two books in the series.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|A lot of famous people's stories are tales of extraordinary talent, amazing luck, or more often, a combination of both. What strikes me about Arnold's story is that the biggest factor in his success is his boundless enthusiasm, open-mindedness, and drive.  Again and again, he stumbles into some situation, greets it with a smile, and cool things happen.  It's a great reminder to me of the importance of a good attitude.  Also, this story is just fun to read.  The writing is good, but it's definitely Arnold's voice, which makes it all the more entertaining.  I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a while.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Couldn't put this down. A must read for all 90's kids. Charlie is all of us at some point of our teenage years.
0007430671|5.0|I love the entire Uthred series.  If you like English history and/or swords and Vikings, you should get it -- period.  Mr. Cornwell does a spectacular job of bringing an extraordinarily interesting historical period -- the formation of England -- to life.  His writing is great, his characters have depth, and the stories are enthralling.<br /><br />As for this particular installment, I think I might prefer the younger Uthred, who's a little more brash and less of lord encumbered by responsibilities and obligations, but that's a nitpick, and I'll keep buying them until he finally takes back Bebbanburg.<br /><br />As for the format (yes, I bought both the paperback and the audiobook; I'm listening to the latter on my commute), there are several different readers in the series, and this guy isn't my favorite, but I'm not sure how much of that is just the fact that he pronounces the archaic place and character names differently from readers of prior installments in the series.  Again, this is a nitpick, and he reader does a fine, dramatic job.<br /><br />The seller I bought this from was actually in Germany.  Even so, the audiobook arrived quickly, and he even threw in a nice Christmas chocolate.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love the story line it just keeps pulling you in, the heat between jace and clary  and the problems they face, Its the perfect book for a fan of twilight to jump over too
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So important to read what a medical doctor have to say about that other world that is more real then the one we live in!
B009XY97VC|5.0|I loved this album, as expected of Two Steps From Hell, it had a good amount of variety while still holding to a general theme. I especially like the songs For the Win, Skyworld, and Sun and Moon.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I thought the first two books in the series were great, but it really took off with this book.  A lot of things come together from the first two and many more possibilities are opened up!  Can't wait to read the remaining books.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love it, fits perfect, great for watching movies, reading books or playing games! I am thankful my husband bought this form me for Christmas.
1401324649|1.0|I cannot believe that anyone could find this book even vaguely funny, let alone hilarious. A classic king's new clothes if ever there was one. Blindingly stupid a sort of Swedish version of the hitch hikers guide on land and without the originality. Allan should have ruptured himself getting out of the window and saved us all a turgid read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Such a good read, it keeps you guessing until the very end.  So much fun to read.  Would highly recommend this book.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Ayn Rand was really reaching her stride when she wrote Fountainhead.  Her themes and ideas and philosophy were pretty much fully developed by this time, as were her skills as a writer and story teller.  Second only to Atlas Shrugged, Fountainhead is a marvelous read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play and entertaining. The horses are sweet to look at and are a real treat! Didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised!
B003WUYP56|4.0|I was pretty skeptical when I started into this book, but it didn't take long before I found myself enjoying the read.  I didn't agree with everything the author was saying, but I have to admit, he makes a pretty persuasive case.  I still think string theory has a lot to offer and am not ready to see it tossed aside, but Smolin's claim that it is getting too much emphasis right now has some merit.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I had only seen the first Batman movie with Christian Bale, but even though I hadn't seen The Dark Knight, I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Dark Knight Rises and didn't feel like I'd missed anything.  Really did keep me on the edge of my seat though!  Would watch it again.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading ALL of the S.H. stories in chronilogical order.  Doyle really was a master story teller, and his stories are still as fresh today as back when he first wrote them.  A fun read.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is the cutest movie - got this for the grandbabies as an extra little gift for chirstmas and of course the love it! everyone loves dr. Seuss!
B0048WQDIE|4.0|I hadn't read Catch-22 since I was a young guy in the Air Force.  But after re-reading it now, I am suprised at how well it has held up.  I do think you will probably enjoy it more if you are or have been in the military, as much of the humor and satire in the book deals with the military beaucracy, and if you haven't experienced it, you may not &#34;get&#34; some of what Heller is presenting.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Everyone loves Dr. Seuss, got this as a addition for my grandbaby for christmas, he loved it and the price was great!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Played A.B. for about fifteen or twenty minutes, got thoroughly bored, and haven't touched it since.  My granddaughter (18 months) does like the A.B. stuffed animals I bought her though.  She calls them cats!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Anyone who has read the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; books by J.K. Rowling knows that the movies haven't quite held to the books, though some have been better than others at this.  This one, the final chapter of the movies is, I'm afraid, guilty as charged.  I refuse to be a spoiler, though by now everyone knows how it ends, and tell you exactly how.  First of all, any of you who have both read the books and seen the movies, knows perfectly well how much it differs.  Still, for those who have only seen the movies, it's a good ending inasmuch as Tom Riddle gets his!  He gets it in the book, too, but I liked the book version a tad better.  Too, Harry does not break the Elder Wand but rather uses it to repair his own.  Still, it's a good ending to a great series of both books and movies, and it certainly is a &#34;must-have&#34; for any Harry Potter fan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! I read & loved 50 shades, but I like the crossfire series better. The female character is so much more mature & much easier for me to relate to in the crossfire series vs the fifty shades series. I can't wait for the third crossfire book to come out! I highly recommend Sylvia Day's books!
B00005ONMP|5.0|This collection of Mendelssohn's works are a pure delight.  I especially like his overtures and in particular his Hebrides Overture, also known as Fingal's Cave.  His music certainly evokes the power of the sea and the waves that crash against the rocks by the cave.  Too, for those of you who remember radio from the 40's and 50's, you'll recognize one of the passages from this piece as some of the incidental music from &#34;The Lone Ranger.&#34;  (Just a side note, this show also used a clip from Von Weber's &#34;Die Frieschutz.&#34;).  Felix Mendelssohn wrote beautiful music, and these disks clearly show this.  As far as I am concerned, this collection is definitely a &#34;must have!&#34;
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Yes you can tell it is on a loop but it is wonderful asleep to. I love the variety and the pictures depicting the sounds are good quality.
B000003FMY|5.0|This is a mix of several Russian composers, with Modest Mussorgsky featured prominently.  It also has Borodin and Glinka, and some others.  In all, it is quite a nicely put together disk.  It has the version of &#34;Pictures at an Exhibition&#34; that was orchestrated by Maurice Ravel, and this version is very nicely performed, as is &#34;Night on Bald Mountain.&#34;  There is a piece from &#34;Prince Igor&#34; by Borodin, and Glinka's overture from &#34;Russlan and Ludmilla.&#34;  There are a couple of other pieces, as well, all combined to make a very enjoyable listening experience.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|DVR didnt work and we missed an episode before it was available On Demand. Amazon Video shoots the way. Pic clear and buffered easily.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was fantastic, it was adorable, heart breaking and an emotional roller coaster. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG I think I've read this trilogy three times and have to say the second book is still my favorite.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas for my son!  I hope that he uses it a lot - since I always rode him on the back of my bike.  I read that the front rider was the way to go now....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book. Its a great story. The ending was the best part. I can't wait for this movie to come out.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|There was a time,  back in the 1990's, when a BBC miniseries put as much emphasis on historical accuracy as it did on entertainment value, perhaps more.  I remember one such program set in the 1920's that was so slow moving and dull that drying paint would have been more interesting.  Those days are over, and Downton Abbey is not your father's BBC miniseries.  Historical accuracy is left for, well, to quote many speakers at the recent GOP convention,  the fact checkers to decide.  No, one does not see jet contrails over the manor house, or hear Led Zeppelin coming from a maid's room, but characters do utter words and phrases not yet coined.  In one episode, our dear Livinia is (in jest) said to be \\"sucking up to\\" her mother in law, which would have been a rather disturbing idea, between two adult women in 1919.<br /><br />In such a world, WWI showed up to add drama to the end of the last episode of the first season, and was gone, having taken out only a couple of superfluous characters, by the time we were 2/3 of the way through Season 2, all wounds healed, except on characters marked for dire ends in Season 3.  The Spanish Flu Pandemic (1919) arrived for one episode in Season 2, in order to take out another superfluous character, but just to make sure we understood her intentions, the episode introduced a Ouija board, so she could speak to us from the beyond.  Yep, this is the New BBC miniseries.  No child left behind.<br /><br />So, it was with no little excitement that Downton Abbey Season 3 crossed the atlantic early this year, and with Shirley MacLaine among the cast.<br /><br />Calm down, she only got three episodes, as the writers apparently didn't allow her a fortune big enough to save Downton Abbey, so there wasn't any need to keep her around once that was revealed.  This is not a spoiler.  Besides, it was a strangely subdued, almost sedated MacLaine.  I imagine she had to have shots due to wounds she suffered in the battle with her wardrobe.  For nearly all of her appearances, MacLaine, rather wildly dressed in 1920's gowns for mature women, seems to be getting swallowed whole by her costume, and can barely keep her head out of its throat, and as a result, is restricted to rather gnomic one liners intended to make her (a New York/Newport socialite) the paragon of Democracy, speaking Truth to the wily Old World landed gentry.<br /><br />As if...<br /><br />Anyone who's read Edith Wharton, or seen the movies (\\"House of Mirth\\") knows that American high society was as constricted, if not moreso, as any of the nobles of Europe, and just as class conscious.  MacLaine's character would have been fawning over the Granthams not pushing back.  AND she's Jewish?  You mean the titled families of England were marrying into foreign Jewish fortunes, in an era when anti-Semitism was barely disguised in the US, and some big wigs over there would later openly sympathize with Hitler?<br /><br />Again, cool down big feller, that's for them fact checkers...<br /><br />Yes, this is the topsy turvy world aimed at lightly educated Moderns, whose concepts of history are hazy at best, and who are so complacent in their world view, of the eternal character of the status quo, the Republic, that science is often thought of as merely \\"another opinion\\".  The New BBC Miniseries is a lot like its PBS cousins, education is but a minor component of its goal.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is pure entertainment in period clothes.  Too much thinking will only cause headaches and make enemies of those around you, who only want to be entertained.  It probably could be better, and who knows, more provocative, but would anybody watch it, these days?  It's sad to have to ask, but would they?
0152465073|5.0|This is one oft favorite books, so cute and sad at the same time, it is NOT a child's book!
1451627297|5.0|In the novel 11/22/63, modern-day English teacher Jake Epping's dying friend Al has something important he needs to show Jake, something that will change his life forever. That something is a portal into the past--1958 to be exact. In his final days, Al gives Jake a mission: stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. However, during those intervening 5 years, something happens to Jake: he stops living the past, and starts to truly live.<br /> Throughout the story, Stephen King conveys themes of change, love, and compassion. Another important theme is choosing between what your heart wants to do, and what your mind knows must be done, no matter the personal cost. 11/22/63 also manages to really make you care for the characters in a way his more action or horror-oriented novels sometimes don't. Also, I love the voice of the character Jake and the insights he makes about differences between the 1950s/60s and today, particularly one that calls Google \\"that twenty-first century Big Brother.\\" If I have one complaint, it's that after the climax the ending feels rushed. On the whole, I'd say that fans of Stephen King or historical fiction would love this book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is an excellent read. I just love it. I loved every part. By the way Percy meats Poseidon. Spoiler.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I shall begin by saying that I loved the film, and that as many have already said, the only problem with the production is Russell Crowe. He may have some musical talent in his personal life, but it is not sufficient to star alongside other professionals and Broadway performers. His lack of energy, tonal deafness... that disparity to an important character as Javert is what reduces a quarter of a star in my rating.<br /><br />The biggest problem here, however, is the song selection. 85% of these highlights are BEAUTIFUL, mesmerizing, spirited, and commendable. The other 15% however, consists of Russell Crowe's \\"Stars\\" and \\"Javert's Suicide\\", and the complete lack of lyrics within the \\"the Final Battle\\". The Battle track is used for story-telling purposes, but we could have done without that here, and in place of it, we could have had \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" (which features Enjolras and Gavroche in their prime), or \\"Lovely Ladies\\" which is just a smart composition altogether. I also wish \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" was included. The song selection's disparity takes off a half of a star in my rating.<br /><br />The final complaint is the abbreviation of certain songs. Notably the bookends - \\"Look Down\\" and \\"Epilogue\\". In \\"Look Down\\", the song has at least another minute in length to add, with the various prisoners singing their short solos before a second chorus. This is absent, and the song immediately cuts to Javert and the parole. In the \\"Epilogue\\", Hugh Jackman has a rather lengthy solo while he is sitting in the church, yet this is completely omitted and the song begins with Fantine. This takes off another quarter of a star in my rating.<br /><br />NOW, onto the GOOD STUFF.<br />Les Misérables is a beautiful production, with energy, vocal range, impressive solos, and wondrous inflection. You'll note that the majority of the reason why this didn't get my full five stars is because there wasn't ENOUGH of the production. Any fan will love it, and anyone not having even seen the play, not having read the book, nor having seen the movie - will appreciate it on their own. I have seen two live musical productions, one in an expensive high school play, and the other in my town's performing arts center. Strangely, the high school play was the better one, and when I compared the professional production to it, I found it somewhat lacking.<br /><br />This musical depicts the smaller points of life and puts them under a microscope. As some reviewers have said, this is where the \\"Occupy\\" movement began, although I'm sure there's plenty of other examples predating Victor Hugo's book and the French revolution. Every action in this story has a consequence. Valjean steals a loaf of bread because his sister's child was starving to death, and that crime landed him in prison for five years. Somewhere in there, he tried to escape, and after being caught, was sentenced to 14 more years of cruel manual labor and imprisonment. 19 years later he's given parole, which he breaks because he doesn't feel anything like a normal citizen. He steals a fortune in silver from the only man to take pity upon him, but when he is caught the Bishop tells the police the silver was a gift. He hopes that Valjean will use the money to buy a new and honest life, that he may one day pay it forward to someone as desperate as he is.<br /><br />This is where the real story begins. This animalistic refugee has matured and cleaned up so well enough that he is now the mayor of Montreuil in Northern France, owning a factory where Fantine works. Fantine gave up her child to the Thenardiers and has devoted her wages to sending them money to raise her. When the foreman finds out she has had a child out of wedlock, he fires her and sends her out on the street. Desperate to secure her daughter Cossette's future, Fantine sells every inch of her pride to the scum of the streets and soon is detained by the police. Valjean stumbles upon the scene and recognizes Fantine, who blames him for having his foreman fire her. Another matter weighs heavy upon Valjean's conscience, as the authorities have apprehended a man believed to be himself. Coming clean would doom his future and possibly Fantine's child who has no one to provide for, while doing nothing would let an innocent man go to prison for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Jean Valjean is a larger than life hero, but his heroics are more inspirational today than ever. A man who can live true to his soul, let go of his hatred, and find love in committing to something selfless is a tale we should all learn. This tale is made especially emotional by the actors of this film who give their performances LIVE during filming, rather than in a studio to be dubbed over their lip-syncing later on. Hugh Jackman manages to perform \\"Look Down\\" raw while water is pouring in his face, Anne Hathaway performs \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" (which she has won a Golden Globe for) in one take, with snot and tears dripping down her face; Samantha Barks sings \\"On My Own\\" in the studio rain - it is hard not to appreciate anyone in the production. To me, this is the best rendition of the musical, and recommended for EVERYONE everywhere.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an excellent book.  The story is incredible.  Most of the people in this country have no idea what the greatest generation went through during WWII.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a fun and exciting new version of the original Temple Run with the mine and the totally new environment with a waterfall and a spinning wheel with spikes on it and the game has a whole new set up from the original version on the main menu of the game. The game also has a new 3D effect throughout the whole game which adds a cool new visual effect. Temple Run is a fun game that I would recommend that you get plus the game is free .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Completely intriguing! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next one! Definitely a story that keeps you in the end of your seat....
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this app is soo cute and loads of fun! cool puzzle type of game. I love the little pudding blobs. they have silly sweet chatachter
034580404X|4.0|I enjoyed the 1st book the most, the 2nd a little less and by the time I got to the 3rd I was a little tired of it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I feel it will help me with all kinds of relationships in life, not just romantic ones.  I learned a lot about myself and what makes me happy, and was able to see how to better love all of the people in my life better.  I'm not normally the type to read this kind of book because I'm stubborn and like to figure things out on my own, but I hit a rough path and felt like I could use a little guidance and this was just the thing.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you enjoyed Bared to You, you won't be disappointed in Reflected in You. Ms Day does a great job expanding not only on the relationship between Gideon & Eva but also on each character individually, including the supporting characters. The story and characters are flawed just enough to be believable and not so much that you want a therapist to take over. Many of the questions that lingered after the conclusion of the first book are answered but of course, different questions hover after Reflected, leaving you anxious for the next installment.
B00957T6X6|3.0|It is boring to read through so much description of war scenes for getting just a bit of interesting story about the involved characters.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I think that I will enjoy building the habitats.  It seems fun so far but I am afraid that it will cost to go very far.
B007V4530A|5.0|Intelligent, interesting and stimulating. It made me want to do a real good presentation. Buy it, you really won't regret.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've been addicted to the original temple run for a while now and was happy to see the sequel.  The graphics are awesome, and I love all the extra stuff but I have one pet peeve, and that is that the tilt control isn't as responsive as on the first game.  It needs to be tweaked a bit to make it match the responsiveness of the first Temple Run game.  If that gets taken care of I'll happily come back and add another star.  Not that it can use it judging by all the 5 star reviews.  I just feel it would be a much better game with the tilt controls made more sensitive.  That said I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is such a great soundtrack. I find myself listening to it multiple times a day. Stars is my favorite. Buy it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is fun and interesting to play. plays good on my kindle fire<br />shows you what it takes to train and maintain horses for real only its<br />A lot easier on here.
B0012CJQY6|4.0|I missed it when it was airing but see a lot of actors in it that have gone on to other television shows. Michael Chiklis is great as usual.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Ok .every thing is fine .the worst thing about it is the path just randomly end .you can't get a high score unless you get lucky .the first Temple RUN is way better than the second.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle's best album yet.  Finally singing all the verses of each song instead of just a taste.  Good selection although some were new to me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved Hopeless could not put the book down. Colleen Hoover s books are amazing. I cannot wait until the release of her next book. What an amazing author. All of Collens books are a must read!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|The orchestra was great, lot of guitar, and the songs were appropriate.  Rod Stewart did a great job.  Glad he sung some songs with other people.
1594135851|5.0|book is awesome, can't wait to order part three. The soft copy and large print makes it an easy read.
B000002J09|5.0|Great Album.  Purchased for my son and even though he likes Led Zeppelin I returned it so he could pick out his own music
B0058YPILY|5.0|As CM fans know, the show is amazing. But the box set also came in perfect condition and everything was flawless when it showed up and was unpacked. Great work!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie, it just does something to you. Thank God for His plan by using this man with everything that was happening at that time. I still cannot fathom anything worse than what these people had to go through just because of their ethnicity. Its History...We need to Learn it...in order to NOT repeat it!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The same ground was covered, literally and figuratively, on too many occasions in this book for me to find it a very good read.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Love the lyrics this band comes up with. &#34;Got run over by a crappy purple Scion&#34; is hilarious stuff, right?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Sometimes you just need a basic calculator to get some quick totals. This is just that. Not a lot of bells and whistles just basic functions. Simple and easy to use.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|Whats not to like-? This is yet another classic and amazing Jesse preformance.  This as with all of his albums will make you want to see him in person.  The talent of he and all of his group is inspiring.  Enjoy.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|This RAM was purchased for a Synology DS1512+ NAS.  The RAM installed easily and was recognized by the system without incident.  The system has been running constantly for about 6 months without issue.  In the time that the system has been running it has been rebooted a dozen times (at most) and the RAM is recognized every time.  (it's hard to go into detail in this kind of RAM review... ah, it works, end of review...  I'm rambling now; it must be time to end the review... or was that time a few minutes ago).
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I think Taylor is getting more mature in her music and the album shows it.  Plus, she is also moving to a more pop sound.  I know Taylor has her critics because of her love life or quality of her voice, but she is a good song writer.  And I find her music fun and light.  It's easy to listen to and that's what I like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is ronchy maybe this game can use a little more characters and different board decks thank you for a good game
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|probably not the best Batman, but it was good.  I like the fun nature of Anne Hathaway's character.  I think I just missed all the gagets.  And the story with the villian was not quite as good as the classic joker, etc.  Definitely worth watching if you have a raining afternoon, but dont set specific time aside to see it.
B00005A46T|5.0|The album that put slipknot at the top of the nu metal scene. &#34;Iowa&#34; is an album that became a true gem with Joey jordison's precision, and Corey Taylor's raw energy that he delivers track after track.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|fun, addictive game. but stopped working after a couple of days which is very disappointing cause it is a very fun game. hopefully it will start back working
0307744434|5.0|I just finished reading The Night Circus and am absolutely in love with it. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. If you come across it please do pick it up, I promise you won't regret it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The story line was very entertaining and the graphics were good. I wanted to know how the story turned out so I kept playing until I finished the whole game. I will play this game again and again in the different modes. Lots of fun I would definitely recommend this game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always look for the TWC app for any handheld device that I get.It shows the most accurate weather available. I don't know why I even try other weather apps.
1401322786|1.0|I was seriously disappointed in this book, especially since I normally love Mitch Albom's work. It's a small book but even at half the size, it would have been too much. I kept reading and reading and wondered--where is the story going and what's the point? At the half-way point, I thought I don't even care anymore what the point is or where the story is going. By the time, I finished this book, I was downright angry with it and at myself for wasting the time. Sorry this is harsh, but that's how this book made me feel.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book way to much I want read it over and over again I think it was the best In the word . Thank you R.J !!!! Your the best!!!!!!!!  I want more there should be a 2nd book!!!!!!
B004RL9T50|2.0|I didn't give this a bad rating because of the movie itself. It looked like a pretty good one, and was looking forward to watching it as a family. However, the quality of Amazon's movie rental services through our Playstation 3 has really gone downhill. We used to rent movies all the time through Amazon, but not anymore. We couldn't get through 2 minutes of the movie without it buffering or pausing and saying it wouldn't work. I would say it was our internet connection, but we haven't changed plans, and we are still able to play movies and shows very well through Netflix. I am disappointed that I paid money to rent Megamind but never got to watch it!

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you are a Judge Dredd fan as I am, you will enjoy this.  Brutal, unflinching, violent, but tempered by beautiful, colorful, interludes whenever someone uses a certain drug, this movie could have been worse than Stallone's version but for three things:<br />1. Karl Urban, a self-professed Dredd admirer, plays the part perfectly.  The helmet never comes off, he speaks with a scowl, he punishes the guilty harshly;  in other words, he IS Dredd.  Urban completely loses himself in the role and in doing so gives the character the edge of believability, which is important in an unbelievably horrible world.<br />2. The Slo-Mo sequences are delightful and not overused.  If the film had a bigger budget they probably would have been, but rolling through the gate at just around $50 million and shot in South Africa probably ensured their effects budget to be small, so the filmmakers worked wonders with the Slo-Mo stuff -- it looks better, as a matter of fact, than the effects in lots of other big Hollywood productions.  It is one of the highlights of the movie.<br />3. No annoying sidekick.  Since I hate Rob Schneider I could not stand Stallone's Dredd, but the character played by Olivia Thirlby more than makes up for the misstep of Schneider in the 1995 version.  Her character is put there to give Dredd a human, emotional anchor, which this film needs because of its graphic violence;  without her Dredd would probably just be a psychopathic killing machine on the order of The Terminator, but her appeals to his mercy, his humanity, validate having her around -- UNLIKE Rob Schneider.  Thirlby took what could have been a cypher role -- a female in a man's movie whose only reason to be there was eye candy -- and gave it chops.  A truly well-done turn by her.<br />As for the other major star in Dredd, though she tries (and maybe that is the problem), Lena Headey's villain is ridiculous, which is saying a lot in a movie like this.  Her take on Ma-Ma gives her ample screen time to mug, sneer and smolder, but never once did I feel menace, and to be as bad as she acts, snapping off kill orders and such, menace should be tantamount.  She was not a match for Dredd at all, so much not that the inevitable showdown between her and Dredd simply showed what she was all along:  a big-mouthed dope fiend and nothing else.  Ma-Ma is the one failure in this movie.<br />Put all together, Dredd is a spot-on adaptation of a beloved comic antihero, made by people who appreciated and understood the source material.  Not many superhero movies can say that.g, sneer and smolder, but never once did I feel menace, and to be as bad as she acts, snapping off kill orders and such, menace should be tantamount.  She was not a match for Dredd at all, so much not that the inevitable showdown between her and Dredd simply showed what she was all along:  a big-mouthed dope fiend and nothing else.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|The Law of Diminishing Returns (tm) states that if sequels are made to a great movie, none of them will be as good.  This law is immutable, though as with all laws, there are exceptions (&#34;Star Wars:  The Empire Strikes Back,&#34; and &#34;Spider-Man 2&#34; spring immediately to mind);  however, MiB3 is not one.  MiB3 has the feel of being made up as it goes along -- which, from what I understand about the production, is not far from the truth:  filming began before a finished script.  Will Smith is game, and Josh Brolin damn near steals the show, but Tommy Lee Jones has basically an extended cameo, to the detriment of the entire movie, and nowhere in sight are the wacky aliens from 1 and 2 (no Jeebs or anyone).  MiB3 just is not nearly as much fun as the classic first and the reviled second;  it distills J's and K's relationship, tells some interesting back story, but without the zany tone and madcap aliens of the previous ones it feels flat and forced.  The magic is gone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You have to be crazy not to fall in love with this book or just the whole plain series!!!! How Collins wrote the characters and followed the whole dystopia storyline with love an  struggles woven in his just magnificent. I'm telling you...you won't be sorry if you read this fantastic book!!!!!

B00AYB1RGG|2.0|It was okay...nothing special.  Seemed a bit lower budget and predictable script.  Acting was fine, again nothing special.  Worth the rental fee but would not bother buying it.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The Verso Prologue cover is definitely reminiscent of many of my old leather-bound books.  On the front there is a blind stamped tendril-like design in the center and in the corners.  The gilt, on both the front and the spine, is slightly imperfect.  This, along with the Italian faux leather appearance, makes it have an \\"old-world\\" style appearance.  On the spine there are four gilt flowers, similar to the one on the front cover.  Instead of raised bands there are indented ones.<br /><br />Inside it is covered with a \\"velvety microfiber fabric\\" that almost feels like suede.  There's a pocket on the left-hand side where one could store notes.  The verso\\" logo graces the pocket.  This Verso Prologue \\"old world\\" style is compatible with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, NOOK, Kobo Wi Fi, Kobo Touch, Kobo Vox, Sonny Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry PlayBook, Samsung Galaxy Tab, HTC Flyer, Delll Streak 7, and more.  I tried a first generation NOOK in this and because of the depth, it's not a great fit because the cover doesn't close well.<br /><br />This is a lovely \\"old-world\\" style cover that is a perfect fit for the bibliophile.  Because is doesn't have an elastic strap to keep it closed I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to transport because if you drop it the corner straps may not hold. They do hold my Kindle Fire and Kindle quite snuggly, but I wouldn't care to take a chance.  The Verso Versailles and the Swedish Wonder do have this feature.

B008MF3OEY|5.0|The Verso Prologue cover is definitely reminiscent of many of my old 3/4 leather-bound books.  The spine actually has seven raised bands with the title \\"VERSO II\\" and guilt flowers and design.  There are also gilt designs on each corner.  The gilt, on both the front and the spine, is slightly imperfect. This, along with the Italian faux leather appearance, makes it have an \\"old-world\\" style appearance.  I love the swirled design, a design that is reminiscent of books from the 1800s.  If the faux leather didn't have such a new look to it, the \\"book\\" would be hard to differentiate from some of my old ones.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|I've. read that it. nags you to rate it so I will go ahead and do it I think it might be a great app .
B0015AARJI|5.0|nothing beats the dualshock contorllers, its the original one and it is the best functioning one, dont be cheap and buy these off brands cause its worth it for an extra amount to buy this controller cause it last so much longer the the others.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I use these mics for live sound in place of the SM58s that they mimic. In the photo, they look they the same as the Shure version, but they are smaller in size in every way. They still have the heft of a 58 and they sound surprisingly similar. The metal windscreen is smaller and much tougher than a 58 - I use these mics when I'm running sound for bands that like to swings mics around and generally abuse them, but don't want to bring their own mics.<br /><br /> I bought 4 of these mics initially and will be buying more. A couple of them have been dropped, kicked, and thrown across the stage a number of times, but I can't tell them apart from the ones that have been treated better. With an SM58, I would definitely see some denting on the windscreen at least - not with these mics, though.<br /><br />Having only used them for live sound, I haven't been able to tell the subtle differences between these mics and the Shure versions. They seem to have the exact same output and sound practically identical to my ear. I've tried other cheaper mics, but I generally stick with the more expensive brand name mics for my work - these mics are the exception and I would use them in place of a 58 without a second thought. The only downside I've found is that they pick up a little more handling noise when in a mic stand - touching or hitting the mic stand transfers more noise than with more expensive mics. Handholding the mic, or swinging and kicking the mic sounds the same.<br /><br />A bargain at twice the price!

B007JWKLP6|5.0|A wonderful trip down momory lane. This film is well done from start to finish. The footage, some old, most not seen by the public before this, all truly amazing. If you liked the Beatles, liked George, liked the 60s, 70s, or 80s, or just enjoy the craftmenship of Scorsese this film is a MUST!
B000002OTL|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has put together a great sound track on this one. He need to make more movie's than he does.
B004GYY714|5.0|We were on vacation in keys,and wanted to at least listen to the Buffalo Sabres game found the station it was great!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I'm prepared to like just about anything with Bruce Willis in it. The premise of this film is very interesting - and in case you don't get it, there's a handy narrative by the young version of our hero. The topic of messing with the time continuum and changing outcomes has been explored many times, and here it is again - taking a look at the balance between personal desire and moral integrity. So that's all good and was entertaining to watch.<br /><br />The plot, however, seemed to lumber along. There was a lack of continuity in the characters. As a viewer I couldn't decide whom I was supposed to like - the young hero, the old hero, the woman, the child-turn-monster. Just when you settle into an emotional track, the plot takes a strange turn. So overall, this movie left me disconcerted rather than fully satisfied.<br /><br />Now you might say - ah, that's an intelligent film! But no - it wasn't intelligence that was disconcerting but rather bumpy story telling. Ol' Bruce played a full spectrum of emotions from total bad-ass killer to sensitive husband and father. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's nose was brilliantly matched to Bruce Willis'. Jeff Daniels put forth some really good character development.<br /><br />So in essence, should you watch the movie? Sure! It's different, it'll keep you on your toes. There is some really gruesome stuff, some interesting stuff. Is it brilliant? I'd say no, but worth the 4 bucks I payed to see it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset has lasted me well over a year and is still the best headset I've ever used. I play a lot of Counter-Strike, and this gives me the edge I need in Competitive matches, letting me hear footsteps and gunshots with surprising accuracy. They tend to have a lot of bleed-through, so they're better for an environment where people aren't going to hear what you're doing.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Both intellectually expanding and soul warming. It captured my attention from the opening sky jump story to the reflection at the end.  The use of mixing past and current experiences in with the \\"next reality\\" imagery was brilliant. Not your typical NDE story.

1250007208|5.0|First of all, I liked it! The author gets major points for coming up with such an original take on the Cinderella story.  Although she has moved the story forward in time and made Cinder an android, that's just the beginning.  She also added her own secondary plots, with the earth struggling to avoid a war with a country formed from human colonists living on the moon and  a dreadful plague sweeping the country where Cinder lives.  Re-reading the previous sentence, it almost sounds too bizarre to be believe, but the whole plot flows quite logically and plausibly from the author's excellent world building narrative.  We never learn about the world in a way that feels disconnected from the plot; instead, we constantly learn new information while staying engaged with the current moment.<br /><br />The major plot points were pretty predictable, even those not pulled directly from the original Cinderella story.  In some books that might bother me, but in this case the exact way the plot unfolded and many of the little details were both interesting and unexpected.  Plus I was expecting predictability to a certain extent since  it is a book based on a fairy tale.  However, the original Cinderella story was definitely just an inspiration for this series, which even in this first book has already diverged enough from the original that calling it simply a re-telling would be doing it an injustice.  The book reminded me more of the movie Ever After (and if you haven't seen that, you should go watch it now) than of the original fairy tale, because of the strong heroine.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I would like to say that I was surprised the ending didn't at least wrap up the romantic plot line as per the original story.  Despite the lack of resolution, the ending wasn't enough of a cliff-hanger to annoy - just enough to leave room for some more wonderful books.  I can't wait for the next one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A thought provoking story and a happy ending for a little girl who should never have had to endure this kind of abuse. I wish all victims could have this type of ending in reality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I could play for hours! so simple but also so entertaining. great game for when you're home with nothing to do.

B006VFLIYK|2.0|The Innocent:  I have read all of David Baldacci  books and I found that this story did not keep my attention. Usually I can not put down his book once I start, this book I had to force myself to finish. I was very dissappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game for kids of all ages. Down loded this for my boyfriends daughter but I play it just as much as she dose.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the same concept as the original so you would expect it to be just a duplicate of it but it's not. the setting is different creating very different obstacles. We get to swing on a rope, get inside a mining cart and new power ups as well. This one is tougher than the first as there are a few tricky things I had to get used to. If you liked the original you would like this one even more!
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Howard Shore has the ability to write amazing music that reaches the soul. The only &#34;bad&#34; thing about this CD is that it has the ability to get stuck in my head. :)
B005LAII80|5.0|I watched the movie when it was in theaters expecting almost nothing and left completely satisfied. This movie isn't going to enthrall you with its lore of dystopian Mega City One or make you love Dredd for the upstanding guy he is, its just going to give you a day in the life of Dredd. A \\"routine drug bust\\" if you will. Easily one of my picks for favorite movie of 2012 and definitely worth a watch!

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Outstanding movie starring Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and David Kross. Worth buying and watching, I have viewed it several times, plus will pass if on to my niece who enjoy movies like this.
0307341550|2.0|O.k. i see that this book got mostly good reviews and i am a little surprised.  the characters are all extremely odd.  i know that in real life there are strange families out there, but this one just felt forced and stiff.  anyone walking into this home and hearing the conversation would say that they are all extremely disturbed.  why camille even stays past a day is a mystery in and of itself.  he little sister is deranged.  camille has not visited for 8 years, her mother is clearly indifferent and at times openly hostile, and the little sister is innsanely jealous?  the mother is a crackpot.  its now wonder camille has stayed away and anyone in their right mind wold never return.  as for the real mystery of the book, i found it totally implausible and kind of felt a let down - like i just spent hours reading this book and this is the resolution?  i was highly disappointed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Kids really enjoyed this movie.  They have already watched it several times so that makes it a hit to me!

B007L3BMGA|2.0|I bought this because I had read so much about it.  Everyone I know was talking about it which made it sound even more interesting, but what a weird heroine.  What strange behaviour<br /><br />I didn`t get to the end of it and certainly won`t be bothered with the follow up books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good god at how awesome this book is. I got so emotionally invested in this series. I cried at the end of every book because they were so good.
B0064BWDRW|3.0|This is only the second Jo Nesbo book I have read.  Perhaps I would have found this one easier to read, had I started at number one and worked my way through.  A number of the characters and relationships are obviously being progressed in this book, but because I don`t know their background, I find some of the book quite confusing.<br /><br />There are someinteresting descriptions of Oslo and surrounding areas.  Like all big cities, it also has its seamy side and we get to know about that too.<br /><br />Interesting but not an easy read for me.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The read is okay but from the middle onwards started to become quite tedious.  Its more like a cross between a porno  and a romance novel. It gives the reader insight into the life of a person whos into BDSM and all the love/hate, anger/laughter of a romance.  Christian is seen as a tormented soul who is driven by past demons and then theres Ana whos this virginal and pure character thats introduced into Christians dark fantasies.  Was expecting something more after hearing all the hype about how great and interesting this book is. Not really my thing and is more about informing people on what BDSM is and what goes on in their sick little fantasy minds. I give it a 3star.

B00007KWI9|4.0|This is the 1969 debut recording of Yes, not to be confused with the band's 1971 landmark release `The Yes Album' with which they broke through to a bigger audience.<br /><br />Most of the song writing is by founder members Jon Anderson and Chris Squire, the early drivers of the band. Some covers of well-known songs (complete re-interpretations is more accurate) by The Beatles and The Byrds also feature.<br /><br />This early line-up included Tony Kaye on keyboards and Peter Banks on guitar, prior to Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe joining the band in 1971. They do a workmanlike job, but Banks lacks Howe's gutsy and inventive style of playing. The vocal harmonies between Anderson and Squire which became such a recognisable part of the `Yes sound' are very much in evidence here, even at this very early stage.<br /><br />For a bunch of guys in their early 20s there's no denying this is an impressive effort, with some fine compositions and tight playing, but then this was the golden age for mould-breaking rock music. The seeds of the later Yes are audible in the music, but overall the sound is that of a melodic pop group.<br /><br />In addition to the 8 original album tracks, this re-issue CD has 6 bonus tracks. You get 2 alternate versions of `Everydays', a track originally on the 1970 `Time and a Word' album; and 2 versions each of the previously unreleased `Dear Father' and `Something's Coming'.<br /><br />There's a 16-page booklet with a well-written Yes retrospective from Mike Tiano, plus all the song lyrics and plenty of pics of the young band. The artwork is very 1960s, and somehow goes with the music.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Excellent entertainment value - both in terms of the author's own sense of humor and in terms of the wonderfully quirky characters who make up the mental athlete scene. The case studies presented (e.g. savants and individuals with brain damage) are interesting in themselves, but value is added by the descriptions of the author's own interaction with the people involved. Finally, enlightening research on the workings of the brain, in particular memory, is presented in an understandable manner.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|the book begins at a very slow pace...I think that it should move faster to keep us interested..i really hope the other two books,which I bought, are not the same...
B00005JA8B|5.0|It was shipped fast and there was no damage. Perfect condition.<br />As for rating the movie, it's been a favorite of mine since the 90's so my opinion of it is biased. It's not a Blu Ray so it's the same screen quality it was in 1987. Which I prefer, brings back childhood memories with my dad.<br /><br />Details: Doesn't have the &#34;bonus features&#34; that come with newer movies, it's talking about language selection. Comes with one disk. It's 107 minutes long.

Nice to see what weather is like near the grand kids with quick click on saved location. Hey Weather Channel For future enhancement would be nice to see current conditions for all my saved locations on one screen. App has all the bells and whistles you get from on line. Maps, forecasts, hour by hour, storm alerts, pictures, etc.
B0058YPL66|5.0|ABC's popular series Once Upon a Time depicts the challenges faced by beloved fairytale characters when a curse transports them to a wretched and cruel land without magic, modern America. Without memory of their former selves, the characters of Storybrooke, Maine, are trapped in modern lives and tangled with issues like adultery, crime, and murder.<br /><br />Thanks to an aged book given to him by his teacher Mary Margaret, formerly known as Snow White, a young boy named Henry begins to understand the town's dark curse, and with little success, tries to educate the citizens of their true identities. Henry must convince an entire town of their forgotten past and track down the savior who will break the curse, all while living under the roof of the evil queen, his adopted mother, Regina.<br /><br />Once Upon a Time began in October of 2011 and received a promising response. The pilot episode pulled in 13 million viewers with a 4.0 rating for viewers between 18 and 49. Since its first season, the show has jumped from number 28 to number 19 in television rankings. In 2012 Once Upon a Time was also nominated for \\"Favorite New TV Drama\\" at the People's Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards while receiving two awards, \\"Best New TV Drama\\" and \\"Best Villain\\", from TV Guide.<br /><br />Since the show is produced by the Disney-owned ABC network, the show uses Disney trademark names like Pongo and Jiminy Cricket in addition to classic characters like Cinderella and Prince Charming. These characters interact outside the confines of their original tales, which result in compelling and intricate relationships that evolve with each episode.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fascinating feature of OUAT is observing how timeless characters respond to the challenges of modern life without the help of magic. The lack of magic comprises the central theme as the appeal of the show lies entirely in possibility: the hope that magic, goodwill, and happy endings do exist outside the pages of a far-forgotten kingdom. The series casts traditional values of chivalry, honor, and love in a current light that instills the audience with a sense of optimism and faith, if only for sixty minutes.<br /><br />The show does, however, lack backstory and romantic appeal for Emma Swan, the savior. Perhaps with the introduction of Henry's father, audiences could see a spark rekindled in the near future.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King is so easy-going and honest in his assessment of how writing works. I blew through this, nodding my head after every page.
B009RX85N0|5.0|ABC's popular series Once Upon a Time depicts the challenges faced by beloved fairytale characters when a curse transports them to a wretched and cruel land without magic, modern America. Without memory of their former selves, the characters of Storybrooke, Maine, are trapped in modern lives and tangled with issues like adultery, crime, and murder.<br /><br />Thanks to an aged book given to him by his teacher Mary Margaret, formerly known as Snow White, a young boy named Henry begins to understand the town's dark curse, and with little success, tries to educate the citizens of their true identities. Henry must convince an entire town of their forgotten past and track down the savior who will break the curse, all while living under the roof of the evil queen, his adopted mother, Regina.<br /><br />Once Upon a Time began in October of 2011 and received a promising response. The pilot episode pulled in 13 million viewers with a 4.0 rating for viewers between 18 and 49. Since its first season, the show has jumped from number 28 to number 19 in television rankings. In 2012 Once Upon a Time was also nominated for \\"Favorite New TV Drama\\" at the People's Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards while receiving two awards, \\"Best New TV Drama\\" and \\"Best Villain\\", from TV Guide.<br /><br />Since the show is produced by the Disney-owned ABC network, the show uses Disney trademark names like Pongo and Jiminy Cricket in addition to classic characters like Cinderella and Prince Charming. These characters interact outside the confines of their original tales, which result in compelling and intricate relationships that evolve with each episode.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fascinating feature of OUAT is observing how timeless characters respond to the challenges of modern life without the help of magic. The lack of magic comprises the central theme as the appeal of the show lies entirely in possibility: the hope that magic, goodwill, and happy endings do exist outside the pages of a far-forgotten kingdom. The series casts traditional values of chivalry, honor, and love in a current light that instills the audience with a sense of optimism and faith, if only for sixty minutes.<br /><br />The show does, however, lack backstory and romantic appeal for Emma Swan, the savior. With the introduction of Henry's father, her former flame, perhaps audiences will see a spark rekindled in the near future. Also, now that Emma and Snow are \\"safely\\" back in Storybrooke, the show has switched primarily to present day, neglecting the traditional fairytale scenes and subplots viewers have found so captivating. Should the switch to modern times span more than a few episodes, compensation with time in the forgotten kingdom will surely be demanded by avid viewers in the third season.<br /><br />Lovers of Disney, the television series Grimm, and fairytales of all sorts are sure to love Once Upon a Time as it offers a modern approach to well-known stories, making the familiar unfamiliar in a most intriguing way.

0451232852|5.0|I didn't think he could top Pillars/World, but I just finished Part 2 of the Trilogy, and it's my favorite by far.  I've learned so much about 20th century world history, politics, social structure, economics, and how they all interrelate.  Too bad school wasn't this exciting!  I love how Ken's fictional characters are representive of the times.  I'm sure many people like this existed.  I never feel his stories are far fetched but always seem completely accurate.  I can't wait for Part 3!!!
B0091574VI|4.0|Really cute movie.  Worth the rental.  Kids loved it.  Good documentary on the chimpanzee.  Even toddlers loved it. Yay yay.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series really draws its audience back in time.  It's fascinating to watch, not just for the story or soap opera that is Downton Abbey, but to see the set with all the vintage and museum type props from houses and cars to hairstyles and clothing, the setting feels genuine, the actors seem real. It's really well done, a definite must watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am IN LOVE with this sequel to the original Temple Run. I love how much more realistic and challenging it is. But be warned this game is super addicting so make sure you have a few hours to play. I highly recommend it!!!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Just absolutely terrible. Not even any campy, B-movie redeeming qualities. The previous films were nothing special but the absolute terribleness of this one just blows them away. Words really can't even begin to describe how painful it was to sit through this whole movie. I'd rather get hit by another drunk driver than see this again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a 70 year old \\"young adult\\" these three books are a pure joy and exciting to read.  I recommend this series to all ages.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|My shrink recommended it to me and now i see why. I´ve enjoyed it lots. Also my girlfriend did it cause she identifies with the author and i´m learning from that too.<br />Very honest and revealing.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great deal for the price.<br />It's got a lot of nice options and is a good way to get white noise.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved the hand held pacman game that came out years ago.  Now that I can play it on my Kindle Fire is amazing.  It is a little &#34;tricky&#34; to move pac-man around the board but the more you play the easier it gets.  It is very addictive cause the more you play and don't get a good score the more you want to try.  If you loved pac-man like I did, I would recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Was not an easy book to read.  Too much terminology for lay people.  I skipped a lot of the words I didn't understand.  Heaven is for Real was a much easier book to read and understand!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Good story, really enjoyed the movie.  The visuals are great!  I have seen this movie more times than I can count ....it is just that good.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I was never really into it at first but I saw the movie and decided to read the book and so far it's really good
B004SKQAJI|5.0|Very glad Iurchased, Michael Flatley is an awesome dancer, but his crew is great, so precise I will never get tired of watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's good but I have a kindle fire and it doesn't have motion recognition so I can't do one certain thing, but besides that the game is great.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|My husband really wanted to see \\"Jack Reacher\\" because of his admiration for Tom Cruise's acting in a multiple number of movies.  This past Tuesday,we decided to check out the film for our 9 year wedding anniversary.  There was strong on-screen chemistry between Tom Cruise's character of Jack Reacher and Rosamund Pike as his lawyer Helen Rodin. David Oyelowo from \\"Red Tails\\" and \\"Lincoln\\" also makes an appearance in the film as Emerson. \\"Jack Reacher\\" is a good film those who like thriller films.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Well the blue ray have some special features like a compilation of Final Fantasy VII and FFVII Crisis core, anyone who doesn't undestand the movie should see those two videos first, it has like 26 minutes of new footage for those people that like having a little more action of this movie.<br />The sound is very good no complains about that, and the video is excelent.<br /><br />If anyone who is not a fan of the Final Fantasy series and is not sure of seeing this movie, give it a try but of course first look into the special features and read the story.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|IT IS FUN BUT IS VERY HARD TO BEAT EVEN ON EASY CANNOT UNLOCK 2ND PLAGUE TYPE STILL FUN,THOUGH THAT IS ALL

0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light which was published by TOR Books on January 8, 2013, is the final installment in the epic fantasy saga, The Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan wrote the first eleven volumes in the series, nearly completing the final volume which was so huge it had to be divided into 3 books.  Unfortunately Robert Jordan passed away before the last book made it out of draft form, and after Jordan's death, Brandon Sanderson, who is famous in his own right for the epic Mistborn series, stepped in and finished the colossal undertaking, writing the final three volumes.<br /><br />The Blurb:<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass.<br />What was, what will be, and what is,<br />may yet fall under the Shadow.<br />Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />I confess, I had my copy on pre order for a l-o-o-ong time, just waiting and drooling for this final installment, so on January 8th I hit the ground running with this book.<br /><br />First off, if you haven't read the first thirteen books in the series this book will make little sense to you as it is the culmination of many, many storylines. This book is no less complicated than the thirteen books that have preceded it, so I will not be giving you a plot summary.  Instead I am going to give you my impressions and say only that some of my dearly loved characters who should have lived, die, and some who should die, do not.<br /><br />Each and every one of the main characters have matured and become the sort of leaders we knew they would have to be if they were to succeed at Tarmon Gai'don, the final battle with Shai'tan, who is the personification of evil. I liked that particular twist, and feel vindicated for having stayed with the series even when it went so far afield in The Path of Daggers. Most of the many threads are brought together in this volume although  some  threads are never resolved.<br /><br />Rand, Mat, and Perrin each fight the battle from a different front, and their stories and unique skills are each central to the final resolution. Logain and Olver both play crucial parts in the last battle. Many minor characters have major parts to play in determining the outcome of Tarmon Gai'don.  The strong roles played by Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve, Moraine and the other Aes Sedai in this final battle are clear and integral to the success of Rand's bid to win this battle.  Love, loss, sorrow and the immense will to survive are part and parcel of the tapestry Sanderson has woven from Jordan's notes in this very fitting end to a monumental series.<br /><br />The final battle is nothing less than epic. This encounter between Rand and Shai'tan begins with a contest of morality tales, which in the end determines Rand's course of action.<br /><br />I shed tears many times, but most especially at the deaths of two important characters in particular, believing they could have accomplished so much had they lived. Yet that is what makes this book and indeed this series so fantastic - the reader CARES about the characters, and this loss makes the outcome more poignant and meaningful.<br /><br />I liked the way Demandred is finally exposed and introduced into Tarmon Gai'don, and I really enjoyed the plot twist in regard to Taim, now known as M'Hael, and the way he is ultimately dealt with. All of the Forsaken are dealt with in ways both creative and fitting.<br /><br />In the end, the final resolution is satisfying, and was well worth the journey. There is a large contingent of people who are upset that the epub edition won't be released until April 9, 2013, but this was a choice made by Robert Jordan's widow. I don't buy too many hard copies of books, being a fan of the Kindle, but I did make an exception for this book.  For me, some books need to be in hard copy form and the Wheel of Time Series is one of them, as are the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />Amazon's reviews are rife with trolls and nay-sayers who couldn't wait to emerge from the woodwork and have their say. Apparently very few of these people purchased the book, much less read it. That is the price of success and these days it's almost an honor to have so many haters just spoiling to knock you down. But their strident caws and self-important rants should have no effect on the true fans of this series. In my humble opinion this work is a masterpiece and is a triumphant finish to the series.<br /><br />I love Brandon Sanderson's handling of this series finale, and feel I more than got my money's worth from this book, as I will definitely read it again and again; it's that good. If you love this series, you will love the way it ends!m the woodwork and have their say. Apparently very few of these people purchased the book, much less read it.

B005LAII1C|5.0|My husband and teen were fans they saw this in the theaters. I bought this as a stocking stuffer and watched it with them. ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!! I would definitely recommend this. NOT FOR CHILDREN THOUGH.
B001NLKT60|5.0|this book will keep you on your toes the entire way. These books are ment to keep you on your toes and keep you reading.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this purchase. My husband and teen are huge fans. My husband loved this as a stocking stuffer. The price was fantastic. I purchased while they had a sale price for this. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of movies and for people that just like good movies. I was not a huge fan but could not help but become one with the incredible story line, acting and cinematography.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have never read a series like these three that kept me so involved that I didn't want to put them down. This author can reach into your mind and draw such wonderous pictures I had to keep going. You will want to do so too! ENJOY!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book for kids & parents to read together.  My daughter is reading this for our mother-daughter book club and it has brought up a lot of great discussions.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Not a review kinda guy.  Thought that this would be an \\"OK\\" movie at best, and was really WOWED by the upbeat kinda hipnotic fun music AND performance by this cast.<br />Watching this is like getting an ice cream in a plain wrapper and finding out it is your favorite flavor.<br />I am going to IMDB now to find out who was behind making this sublime, fun and entertaining movie, because I am definitely going to make a note of it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The writing is so smart, the acting is outstanding. Sherlock and Watson play well together, so today. I love this show.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love these types of apps.  I have SleepyTime and Relaxation Sounds also.  I like this for the realistic sounds and the large icons in the carousel view.  I played this all day at work today and it was great for relaxing background sounds.  It reminded me of the days where you used to take one of those small sound machines with you when traveling or had one at the office.  Only this sounds a lot better than any of those ever did.  I really like the options for the sleep timer, alarm, clock, volume options, on-screen controls.  All around a very nice app!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely love this story.  I am about half way through and I can hardly put it down.  Definitely one of his best books!

B0084BMUFA|4.0|This book was great to see and read. This book is good for young and older kids to adults. My whole family enjoyed this.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|People need to be mindful of what permissions they are giving away. This app requires you to let it see your phone identity - your phone number. Guess how these people make their money - they sell your # to robodialers.  Why else would they require this info? It certainly has nothing to do with providing &quot;white noise&quot;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run Two is an exciting sequel to Temple Run. It has a lot of rather unexpected obstacles. I played it on my friends Iphone and fell in love with it. I couldn't wait until it was available on the Kindle, and finally it is! I love this game and it has no flaws!

B005X7HA6C|5.0|DVD is just as described and arrived very quickly. Seems to be new with no damage or wear. Good job.

B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Tom Hooper's movie of \\"Les Miserables\\" is by far the biggest disappointment of the year and, in fact, one of the year's worst films. It wouldn't have been this way if the worthy project had been given to a different director.<br /><br />The original stage musical has been justifiably loved by many and won many awards in its various languages. Though flawed by its paucity of melodic creativity (there seems to be one song that keeps reappearing throughout with small variations) and a tendency toward over-bloating the material (Javert dies not from an ignominious death in a canal but a leap from a height that rivals the top of Mount Everest), the original musical was a masterpiece of adaptation from the Victor Hugo novel.<br /><br />The movie captures that accurately and perhaps beautifully but the beloved property has been undermined and eventually destroyed by the most incoherent and pedestrian film direction I've witnessed in at least a decade. In short, the film is a mess due to Tom Hooper's insistence of dizzying, relentless close-ups of grotesque singing faces spasmodically darting about, and his total inability to place two or three people into an organized and meaningful composed shot. Establishing shots are completely absent, and no attention seems paid to any visual relationships between characters, the organizing of which is a prerequisite for any director.<br /><br />One searches in vain for any intelligent use of space here, as Hooper haphazardly frames faces off-center, too high or too low, as if a child or a disabled grandparent inadvertently picked up the camera and aimed it without being able to see its image through the viewfinder.<br /><br />In the hands of a competent director a simple conversation (or a duet) between two lovers can be a thing of significance and beauty in which we experience one lover declaring love at the same time we experience the reactions of the other lover simply listening, but here all we get is one face at a time repeatedly shoved into our mugs in an assault as if an out-of-control jack-in-the-box puppet is out to get us. This is no way to convey the subtlety or sensitivity of a marvelous property like this epic musical. It only remains to see if the aficionados of the original have the good sense (and the imagination) to realize what this film could have been -- and how much they've been short-changed as well as dishonored.<br /><br />Sorry this functions as a mere footnote, but a word needs to be said about the singing. In essence, some are inadequate for the task (Crowe's weakness bothers me less than Jackman's irritatingly uncontrollable vibrato) but a few are marvelous (like Samantha Barks and David Heddlestone). However, it is truly Anne Hathaway's earnestness and heart-felt singing that towers over the rest of the movie and will surely garner her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.<br /><br />And in the future I can only hope that any project I value doesn't fall into the bungling hands of Mr. Hooper!shoved into our mugs in an assault as if an out-of-control jack-in-the-box puppet is out to get us.

B006HL9G10|5.0|It's precisely what I wanted.  There are several tones of bell/gong sounds to choose from and a wood block tone too.  It can be set to chime one, two or three times and then again after the amount of time you choose mark the end of your meditation time.  It's perfect.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game was fine until I reached level 50 or so. Then it started to close in the middle of almost everything. It shut down when I was trying to make a in-app purchase, I never rec'd it, of course. I've been trying to get a refund or the credit since 1/3/13. If it wasn't for this hiccup I would have given it five stars. I think I've figured out how to prevent this. So far so good it's been working for three days now.

They keep us safe in the night, and I personally am glad that their there. Read this book, and learn the dedication required to be one of these Me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose this rating because it's pretty simple. The book rocks. One time I got hooked reading it from eight in the afternoon to five in the morning. I couldn't stop reading it's like a drug, but a good healthy drug. Nothing bad can come out of reading this book. Your book caught my attention when I heard someone reading it. They where at the part where Percy sliced the head of Medusa right off her shoulders. When I heard them read that part I asked them what they where reading and if it was any good. They didn't take their eyes off the book but they told me it was better than they imagined.  After that I knew I just had to read it myself to see if it really was good, and it was. Rick you are a great writer keep it up and well thanks I loved the book.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I cant get on it ;I downloaded it and it wont let me on and plus it looks stuped so.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is great if you are in love with poets, authors, clothes, traditions, or anything else in the 20's! Love it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game is very glitchy it is a lot worse than temple run I personally wouldn't recommend this app you really cant turn it is way to over made.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|the game itself is good. until it crashes and doesn't let you play. kindle just makes s***** products that don't work
B004LX0D36|5.0|This is a classic that I missed and wanted to read for a long time. Written in the old english style it was a bit tricky to comprehend although as I got more into it the book kept me intrigued. A must read for most anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really great book, could not put it down, left you wanting more wish there was a fourth book. Love the detail .
B004M20YDU|5.0|I bought this for my son and he LOVES the movie and the music and wanted me to buy this for his ipod.  I also loved the movie and the music.  You don't have to see the movie to enjoy this music but I would highly recommend watching the movie.
B004TSXUWY|2.0|This book before I go to sleep I have given up on as I find it hard to stay with it.  Bit boring unfortunately
B004HO6HWK|5.0|I watched this movie on HBO and loved it.  I am a huge fan of Ben Foster and he is great in this movie.  I bought this for my 21 year old son and he also loved the movie.  He's a fan of Jason Statham.  Simon West did a great job directing.  Should this movie be nominated for the academy award?  No, but it's highly entertaining and this is one of Jason Statham's better movies.
B007NZQU72|3.0|Haven't finished it yet, but was greatly relieved to find a book that identified what I have been experiencing all my life. Though the author is a psychologist, I don't have confidence that all the info in the book is correct. It just isn't convincing in places. The book, however, is very helpful and worth reading given the lack of info available. Lea
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Watched this over the holidays and loved this movie.  Wasn't sure what this movie was going to be about but I was pleasantly surprised. My 21 year old son told me to buy this because he thought it was great. Robert Downey jr. is excellent and funny but Val Kilmer stole the show in this movie.  Highly recommend.  These two need to do another movie together.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Saw this in the movie theater with my daughter, we absolutely loved it. There was a good balance of singing and movie to where the singing didn't over do it. Rebel Wilson is hilarious but the whole cast was great definately recommend the movie.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I could write a novel about how good this movie is.  I saw this movie a long time ago and wanted to add it to my blu-ray collection.  Christian Bale is amazing, stunning, I could go on and on...  How could you go wrong with Spielberg.  Just buy the movie and enjoy!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|One of my favorite shows on right now. This show never ceases to surprise me and having Charlie Hunnam on every episode doesn't hurt either :)
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Fast delivery and good packaging. Item as described and shown. I love this movie and the music. Highly recommend.  Even if you didn't see the movie, you will love this soundtrack.  I would recommend the movie too.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I downloaded the game thinking it was just another bubble popping one to keep my daughter busy while we waited. When I actually sat down and played it myself I liked the concept of a limited amout of bubbles with power ups you could earn to get more bubbles or special bubbles so you have to shoot wisely and see how far you can get before you run out.  I play it all the time it's very easy to waste a lot of time getting caught up in the game.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|I finally saw this recently on HBO and I love this movie.  I bought this movie to add to my blu-ray collection.  Great storytelling and wonderfully narrated.  This movie definitely deserved to win best picture/director, 9 academy awards total.  Highly recommend.  I don't need to write a really long review.  Just buy the movie and enjoy!
0345525558|4.0|i was a little wary about reading this book--I didn't know if it was chick-lit.  Instead, I found a well-written first novel.  Surprisingly good for a first novel.<br /><br />Victoria, the main character, has been in and out of abusive foster homes.  She is so damaged emotionally that she can't manage to stay anywhere for very long.  Her time has almost run out as far as being adopted.<br /><br />One woman, Elizabeth, takes her in at the age of 9 and intends to adopt her.  She gradually learns to love the little girl, despite her tantrums and her acting out.  She teaches Victoria the language of flowers, a system of flower meanings that started in Victorian times that lets you send messages according to what each flower means.  For instance, a red rose means love.<br /><br />Through a series of events, Victoria is taken away from Elizabeth and is put into a group home until the age of 18 when she is emancipated from the system.<br /><br />After being on her own for a while, she meets Renata, a woman who owns a flower shop and gets a job there.  Without telling the rest of the story, I recommend this book and recommend that you experience it.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas because he LOVES the movie and the music. I totally agree with him.  I also loved the movie and the music. Highly recommend.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all his books; &#34;The Racketeer&#34; grabbed my full attention making it a fast read. Has a great ending.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I grew up as a kid watching this amazing horse.  I could not wait to watch this movie.  We watched it over the holidays with my kids (18 and 21).  I had to talk my son into watching this movie but when he saw that John Malkovich is in the movie he decided to watch.  We all loved this movie, including my son!  This is an amazing tribute to Secretariat.  This movie shows what a miracle this animal was not only to it's owner but to the world.  It was almost like this horse was a gift from the Gods.  Buy this movie.
B00936A0RU|5.0|After watching the Discovery Channels MOONSHINERS one night I realized that Franklin County, Virginia the location of the movie LAWLESS is the home county of Tim and Tickle. Wonder is there any connection? Enjoyed this movie. High quality!
B00947N6UG|5.0|I took my son to watch this movie in theaters and as anyone with a toddler knows, it's hard to get them to sit still.  He sat through most of it and then towards the end of the movie I had to bribe him with candy.  He liked pointing out Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny to me.  It's a great movie for children and adults, a truly genuine film that doesn't have any of the innuendo that some movies seem to have now.  And if there was, I didn't notice any.
0307887448|4.0|...Yeah! I enjoyed OASIS! Ready Player One reminded me of Under the Never Sky (Aria's world has the Realms which is the equivalent of OASIS).<br /><br />Okay. So I knew half the nerdy games and 80's trivia that Ernest Cline kept on babbling about throughout Ready Player One. I was an 80's baby, after all. But I am telling you.. you don't need to be acquainted with the 80's stuff to enjoy this book! It was entertaining to the max. =)<br /><br />The middle went flat when Wade retreated to his shell after a romance flop. But overall, the adventure of Parcival in OASIS in search of the prize is addicting. I kind of want to have an avatar, too. Ha!<br /><br />I liked Wade's relationship with Aech (I was surprised with Aech's true identity). It made me think of true friendships I found throught the net (mostly because of reading and blogging). Sometimes, you just know if a person is a friend even though you haven't seen him/her yet, right? Well, Wade and Aech are like that. They are best friends in OASIS, but in real life? They haven't even met!<br /><br />The challenges that every avatar need to pass in order to unlock a gate was thrilling and fun! I love puzzles and solving riddles (well, only in books!) and Ready Player One is full of that (about 80's trivia and games, of course).<br /><br />More often than not, people escaped reality by creating an alternate life online. Here in Ready Player One, Wade forgot how it is to live outside of OASIS. It made me smile that in the end, he has a reason to unplugged from the virtual world, and look forward to returning to his real life, no matter how uncertain it is.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot say I have ever been so addicted to a series!  Excellent character development and the visual and sound effects are exceptional!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The storyline is better than the first book. Ana isn't so helpless and needy. The Prince charming, big mansion,endless spending becomes repetitive. Overall a great read.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It's Silver Thermal Compound.  It works as advertised and keeps my CPU - Fan interface working great!  I would recommend it to anyone.
B004UFEJVW|4.0|When \\"Up\\" came out in theaters I thought the concept of the movie was original and refreshing.  A great film with a sentimental  story, lovable characters and enough adventure to keep you hooked.  But watching it in Disney Blu-ray brought the film into a whole new light.  The animation is incredible and the colors are as vibrant as ever.  This film was made for Blu-ray!
B004QSQML8|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid because of the makeup and costume design - most especially the dark one.  I still want a costume that awesome for Halloween.  Sadly my voice would need serious modification to sound right.<br /><br />This has the directors cut and theatrical release.  I prefer the Theatrical Release because of the sound track by Tangerine Dream as that was what I grew up with.<br /><br />I've yet to watch the Director's cut but perhaps I will get around to that one day.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's an easy book to read. I could hardly put it down. I would recommend this book to everyone I know.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Product is sturdy, works well and does everything that it is supposed to.  It is heavy, but that's part of the reason I bought it, to protect my Kindle.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is the best group I've heard all year, and last year.  I love his voice and the piano and drums are just phenomenal.  Very happy without this download, would purchase again and again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game needs 5 stars because you can build anything you want but what sucks is thiar is no animals.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Love this book. Think everyone should read it. Service was flaw,ess ordered online and had the e-version immediately. Definitely would recommend to all.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app is very minimal and child like. Plus there are no directions for the games as some are not self explanatory.
1451683405|5.0|The book is small and like most of sam harris's book needs alot of unpackinng to make it sensable.<br />It takes a ok reader about four hours to read the first time but expect to at least read it twice before understanding his point.  then another two weeks to realize that he might be right about the points that you dont trust.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I think I would have given this movie a better rating if I liked this brand of horror. I don't like human on human violence when it comes down to it, a little too real, a little too close to home I guess. I didn't know this movie had no outside causes till the end. While I liked it, the acting was good, the movie well made, the ending interesting, I think next time I need to make sure the movie is not simply a thriller!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not what I was expecting but it was still a great quick read. started off a little slow but worth finishing.
B0086700CM|5.0|My children love this game.  The best part is that it was free to us and everyone in our family is able to enjoy it. :)
B000002KHH|5.0|One of my favorite heavy metal albums. THE original metal band! Can't get enough of this album or Black Sabbath!
B004LVTTCE|5.0|I have passed on watching this movie a few times, I didn't think it would be something I would like, being a middle aged woman, and not real out doorsie...  :)  But I checked it out at the library and I was spellbound right from the very beginning... It was so intense in parts that it was almost hard for me to watch... And because it is the true story of Aron Ralston's and I had known about him, it was even more touching... James Franco is phenomenal in this movie!!.. I was so taken by this movie, that after I watched the movie I purchased a DVD for my son and after researching Aron Ralston I even purchased Aron Ralston's book &#34;Between A Rock And A Hard Place&#34; for my son... So glad I did!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game would be a five star rating for me because it works great for my kindle, but at times I'll press the save me option for the game it would completely exit out of my game and take all my gems. But besides that great game if you guys fix this you'll get 5 stars from me.
B000Y96EWK|5.0|Delivers as advertised.  And Jason Bourne Rocks, as well. (word. word. word. word. word. word. word. word. word. word. word. word.) &#60;--- My review wasn't 'long enough'...? Why did it insist I add '11 more words'...?
B001G70M6S|5.0|I recently purchased a pack of this FP-3000B film for my Polaroid Land Camera 100.  This was my third time using my polaroid camera. My first two trials were with the FP-100C film, and I must say, I was more pleased with the outcome of the b/w film. Even with just some overhead fluorescent lighting, it still produced some good shadows and balance between light & dark. I had let the film develop or about 2 minutes before peeling the paper off. Overall, I was very happy with this film.
B002EXMYBY|5.0|Instant, easy, great quality.  Becoming enamored with the service and concept of 'buying' video content that doesn't eat up your HD space, but sits in their cloud.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is pretty awesome. Very addictive and fun. Catch myself playing it a bit too often. The one thing I wish was in the game though is more goals. Not sure if I accidentally turned them of or something because I'm a high level but only have received one goal so far. Other then that sweet game.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great songs and all done well. Wish it had been a two disk set.So many other songs I would have loved to hear live by the greatest rock band ever!!!!!!!!!.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great update to the original. Graphics are nicer, but also some new game features that make it more than just the same. I haven't had any problems with the controls (s3) or any lag during game play.<br />I really like the concept of non intrusive in game purchase. No nagging adds popping up and you can choose to spend money or go the slow way and play to get the upgrades.<br />The only problem i have with the game is that there is no exit (or it's somehow hidden). The old game you could  use escape to get out of the main menu. Here you don't have that option.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal.  One of my favorite albums of all time.  Glad my brother had some UFO albums around in the 70s.  I cranked them up and was hooked.  Got this one myself several years later, and consider it a timeless classic.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|A fairy tale-like story that is entertaining, defines interesting and lovable characters, and makes you feel good in the end.
B009X011UQ|5.0|I seem to afford the protection the Kindle needs. It has not been dropped yet so the testing is still in progress.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|can't reveiw at this time,plan on trying out soon,good program,hope to reveiw soon hope to soon can't wait two moor woords
B0090OW7J4|4.0|John Hiatt's Mystic Pinball is in constant rotation on the phone, car & stereo. He sings from the heart,  the songs are so well written it is no wonder he is so critically acclaimed and crazy he does not  get more airplay. \\"We're Alright Now \\" is a rowdy and optimistic song that will have you reaching for the repeat button and turning up the volume.
B005USZML4|4.0|This is an easy read for those lazy rainy days!  It is also appropriate for young readers age 9 and older. There are no four letter words or sexual situations to worry about
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read book 1,2 and then 3 just kept me wanting more.  The thought process at the end of the book with Mr. G's thoughts were just great and brought so much to light for me...
B008DVJMAW|5.0|If you miss good old southern rock, get this CD! If you get a chance see them live along with the Sad Brown Band.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was very very good.  Heard about it through hear say and decided to buy it and it was very much worth the money.
B000W9399S|3.0|This book was part of our book club reading list, chosen for it's humor and satire. It did fulfill those qualities, but the book kept jumping around from place to place; &#34;person&#34; to &#34;person.&#34; Not my &#34;thing&#34;. With just a few exceptions, fantasy books are not my favorite free time reading. Give me a good Tolkien or at the other end of the spectrum, Rowling book. I'll stick to sci-fi writers Arthur Clarke, George Lucas or Rod Serling, I won't bother reading the rest of the Discworld series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At the beginning it was a little slow for me but once I started reading I couldn't stop and before I knew it I was buying book 2..lol
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The story itself was good and kept the reader guessing at every turn.  The characters were (for the most part) three-dimensional.  There were a few spots where the writer clearly wanted a quick tie-up for some of the loose ends and thus the plot felt a bit forced.  There were also some scenarios where characters would clearly need a lot of time and therapy to learn to deal with what had come up, and yet they overcame it in a few minutes with just a little help from one other person.  That was a little hard to get past.  It's a page-turner though.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a well made App.  The background stereo music makes for a tranquil experience  (you might expect these sounds while getting a massage). One really should wear ear buds to enhance the music experience.  This App could be  therapy after a frantic day of work rushing to do this and that.<br /><br />This App has the potential to build patience in an individual. I agree with all the positive reviews. Take a break from it all, and enjoy a relaxing experience!<br /><br />.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|I love Rihanna's music! The album opens up with a strong energy and really gets you moving. It continues to play a mix of her known tracks early on like, 'Diamonds' and 'Stay' along with songs which don't disappoint (I love 'Jump' and 'Pour It Up'). Typical of many albums, all the great songs are in the beginning and eventually I find myself trailing off at the 10th track 'Nobody's Business', which isn't a bad number to fall off at. That leaves 5 'meh' songs so I think I got my money's worth for sure. I run through the album pretty quickly though as the songs seem pretty short, but hey, it's still a lot of fun!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved this book! I didn't want to put it down, and I didn't want it to end! Pendergast fans wlll love this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I remember kids playing the first Temple Run on the school bus last year. It was a blast. But this one is even better! Crisp graphics, smooth gameplay, more upgrades, better menus, and still stays faithful to the original! I also like how they don't scam you out of your money (im looking at you, Glu Games) and keep it ad free. The only problem is the new gems. Basicly what they allow you to do is buy a bunch of them, ressurect yourself every time you die, and dominate the leaderboard.<br />Meanwhile the rest of us are playing legitimately and not getting nearly as good scores. Please return the revival wings! -Thank you
0439023513|3.0|I have enjoyed reading this series. It's a great story that's hard to put down, with tension that never wanes. But as much as I enjoyed the first 2 books, the final book of the trilogy didn't do as much for me, for many reasons.<br /><br />An accomplished writer I know once said that he prefers stories in which he likes the main character(s), even if they're highly flawed. Somewhere in the middle of the book, I realized I no longer liked Katniss. Even before the horrors of the war, she behaves like a sullen teen, making everything about her, looking for reasons to spew anger at anyone, thinking about herself instead of the big picture. While she's never been a nice person, her protection of her family and Peeta in previous books and her willingness to adapt to harsh circumstances made us like her. That's gone here. Moreover, Gale has a mostly useless role and Peeta's been turned into a freak show. It was the other characters - Haymitch, Finnick, even Johanna - I liked.<br /><br />Much of the book is dark and gruesome, with one grisly injury or death after the next. It never ends. During the war, the book hurtles 999 ways to die at the reader. Nets with barbs. Bombs that blow people to bits. Steam that burns you alive. More muttations. Children being blown up. Key characters dying right and left. After a while I lost interest and the deaths seemed almost cartoonish. I understand the importance of conveying the horrors of war - but the author has already shown she is good at that, and this would have been more effective if there was more emphasis on the characters and less on endless descriptions of all the ways the Capitol devised to kill people.<br /><br />[SPOILERS]<br />Finally, while I understand important characters must be sacrificed in a story like this, Finnick's death made me put down the book and not want to pick it up again. It was unworthy of such a great character, to just get devoured like any disposable minor character. Worse, there was barely any mention of him afterward. By the time Prim died, I didn't care much because so many other disgusting things had happened that I had nothing left to feel attached to. Not good.<br /><br />I liked the ending. It befitted the book. I'll admit I expected her to wind up with Gale, not Peeta. But as the story drew on, it became more difficult to imagine her with anyone, and the author's choice made sense.<br /><br />Overall, even with these criticisms, this was an impressive series and I greatly look forward to the movies.ion of him afterward.

B004GKMV3Y|4.0|I thoughally enjoyed reading this story. It was very well written, I am a romantic at heart so this story was right down my street.
0439023491|4.0|I enjoyed the first book in this series, and I enjoyed this one as well. Since Book 1 covered the 74th Hunger Games, you have the feeling that was intentional, that the 75th will be something special, and it is. This time, the Capitol decides that the Games will include only former winners, which provides a twist that changes things quite a bit. Here, the tributes include those who are old, frail, or addicted to drugs, but it also includes those who have firsthand experience winning the Games as well as varying degrees of (useful) knowledge that only life can give you.<br /><br />Here, the Gale/Peeta carrot is still dangled before us as Katniss develops relationships with both men, for different reasons. Several new interesting characters are introduced into the story, characters that are interesting enough to make you wonder if they'll be sticking around a while. The Games themselves aren't nearly as interesting as in Book 1, but they aren't supposed to be, as here they're a means to move a bigger story forward. And while you aren't told what's happening until the end [SPOILER], you get the strong feeling all of this is part of a bigger plot to overthrow the Capitol, and the author leaves several breadcrumbs that will all lead somewhere - namely, to the beginning of a nationwide rebellion against the capitol. This is the topic of Book 3.<br /><br />A good book in an interesting series.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was Great!  I loved it.  Perfect for someone who likes classic stories or Christmas stories<br /><br />It was very good
1582701709|4.0|The message promoted self-creation and that is empowering.  It definitely makes one look inward to search if one is using the innate creative power we all have to make the best world possible for ourselves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was way more than a book. I thought I was actually there! Some things were different from the movie, but I'm not going to reveal anything. You know what that means, your going to have to read it yourself. I highly recommend this book to people who love action and romance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a really cool game and if your a wis at temple run then this should be a breeze! once you start its like an addiction!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I liked it. I have read all the books in the series. This one was, by, far the most riveting book in The Heroes of Olympus series. I felt like I was actually in the story even more than I felt in the other books.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It is tantamount to a crime that this series was not renewed. Witty, thrilling, and deeply fascinating this series should have had a long run. Like Arrested Development, the folks in control of TV shows got some 'spaining to do.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is great but after day one it wouldn't let me open this app so I deleted it from my kindle fire yet it will not let me install it again :(
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Very happy, fast delivered. This movie is amazing I recommend to everyone to watched, great action, Jean Reno,Natalie Portman and Gary old man nail their respective roles.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read this in a day and I couldn't put it down! Buy now and you won't regret it I promise!
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I love this movie Lucy Liu,Julie Dreyfus,Daryl Hannah and Chiaki Kuriyama each of them nail their roles, this is also a fantastic movie and Perla Haney-Jardine  was amazing at her role.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this down, and when I did, it was because I forced myself to! Everything about this book kept me intrigued, whether it was the romance, or the suspenseful secrets that kept coming to the surface, they all kept me wanting to read on to the next page.
B007THA4FI|3.0|In the beginning it was very confusing. Way to many characters introduced in the first couple chapters. But as you read on you get to know them and it draws you in to the lives of the town.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I like the inside scoop, but I thought the writing was a bit disjointed in parts. A book worth reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Oliver  this game SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much. It's so much more interesting then the first one. Everyone can relate that with the first one we would all sit there and play for half an hour  to an hour!! I just absolutly LOVE this game it's just soo fun. It makes you kinda dizzy though but it's still great I don't mind it at all.I think everyone should get it ALL ages doesn't matter. To much fun not to play  I Love it solo much like I said twenty times before ;)<br />  Hope you enjoy<br />  :)<br /><br />  Bcjidwbchcjdkdkjdhxhcjcbfvufbxbx<br /> Hope you enjoy
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Really great filming, acting and surprise scares--I've seen a lot of post-apocalyptic films, vampire films...this definitely kept me guessing. The film took classic, over used ideas and made something new and fresh. Plus the film added in deeper themese other than blood and guts to give the storyline merit.<br /><br />Be warned--don't watch by yourself in the dark! :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  It is fun.  I enjoyed it when I was a kid and I still love it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and the app is wonderful. I haven't had any problems with the app at all. Love it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was pages  of boring rhetoric and once the characters started to develop they were quite predictable as was the storyline.  Of course there were a few specific events that a reader may not have predicted, and I did read it to the bitter end.  The upshot is I am sorry I wasted my time slogging through this book when there are so many other good works out there.  I sum this book up by saying &#34;&#34;crazies rule and the more reasonable of us, let them.&#34;<br />\
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie, along with You've Got Mail, is one of my two favorite winter/holiday movies. I love the plot, and I love the dual-storylines. Jack Black and Kate Winslet are my favorite!
B008NW67IQ|5.0|What an amazing album. My daughter got me hooked on Mumford and Sons.  Can't get enough of their music! Happy lady!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|You've got maybe a 50/50 chance of this working on Kindle Fire. Me personally, it worked the first couple of times I loaded it up, then it died and refused to work from then on. From what I played, it's as fine a game as the first, but I refuse to give anymore stars if they can't get it to work.
B005D63ICI|4.0|It's hard to follow Season Four's great performance by John Lithgow and the chilling end, but Season Five is holding its own if you're really into Dexter's personality &#34;flaws&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it allowed my to play a few time but then I closed it and when I went to open again, it just showed the screen with the big &quot;i&quot;  on it and then closed. I have to delete the app and re download it so I can play it! NOTE, the game is AWESOME but the app just wont open right
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I refrained from seeing this in the theatres because I simply thought it would stink.  I had no choices in Red Box one night so I got it.  I put it in and was loving it!  The aliens are funny, creepy and disgusting and the plot works for the movie.  Tommy Lee looks ancient but his younger self played by Josh Brolin is amazingly done.  If you liked the first two, you will love this one as well.  Obviously if you get anal about the whole time travel thing, there are errors....but who cares!  This is one fun movie!
B009CG9JFU|4.0|Of course, the book Dune is way too complex to capture in one movie...it would have to be done as a trilogy, like LOTRs.  But, this does a great job within that limitation.  Being directed by David Lynch, there is a strangeness that is beyond anything Frank Herbert would have imagined, which can be both interesting and off-putting.  The costumes are awesome, the machinery and weaponry are unique.  The worms are great for the movie making capabilities of the time.  The characters are a bit over the top, again a bit weirder than FH wrote them, but that is David Lynch for you.  Even with all the strangeness (some would say ridiculousness, but I wouldnt go that far), the movie works, is very entertaining and is consistent with the spirit of the book.  If you haven't read the book the movie can be a bit difficult to follow, but you will catch on.
B005APT8A8|4.0|I couldn't resist purchasing this 13 disc Mini LP collection. I am an early fan of the Byrds, I started listening in 1965, and I still enjoy their folk-rock 12 string LA based rock thing. This collection is so cool, and so affordable, that anyone who still actually plays CDs should have a copy. I am enjoying my box set, you please do the same.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Thank you for writing this series. You have inspired me to consider when I grow up become a Greek Mythology professor.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Easy to use and lots of variations on the tileformations.<br />Keeps you entertained on those long waiting room visits, or when there is nothing on TV.
B005USZML4|3.0|I have read most of the author's work, having been a fan for many years. However, surprised is an understatement when I started this one. i was expecting another Grishham thriller filled with intregue and suspense. Well it did have that to a degree but the entire book was directed to a much younger reading audience. I continued on anyway and finished the book and it was an enjoyable time spent. I must confess that reading a novel wihout the language and violence so in evidence in most of today's novels was rather refreshing. However, I was not expecting what I received and that is why I gave it only 3 stars. For a kids book it probably would be worth at least a 4 or maybe even 5 stars.<br /><br />I don't blame the author or anyone else for being surprised as it was my responsiblity to read the reviews first, which i neglected to do, before purchasing. Knowing what I know now about Theo Boone, I'll probably let my grandkids read 'his' stories instead of me.
B0086700CM|2.0|While this game has good graphics it lags at times and WHEN IS AMAZON GETTING TEMPLE RUN 2???? It is a very fun, improved sequel already available on Google play
B003NX76BM|5.0|I always enjoy books by Nora Roberts.  Her research into the them of her books is great and this met expectations.  Dogs trained in search and rescue was entertaining and insightful.  The twist the book took was unexpected and and a surprise.  I would highly recommend this book for fans of Nora Roberts.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Can't wait for more episodes. The best new series in a long time. Stylish and fun. Lost fans should love it.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Not very useful for updating docs without paying extra. But it's good to have access to documents without having a laptop with you. Perfect for traveling.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very apprehensive but I finally read all 3 and they were great! I really can relate to Anastasia's character and Christian's character reminds me of some one I know. Great story... a little raunchy but the story is great.
B004H22RTY|5.0|thank you it completed my collection at the time. i will cherish this as i am a movie lover again thanks
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I can't believe how many different sounds there are! This is perfect for a newborn baby! My most favorite app yet!
B007FJFDXS|4.0|My son and I enjoy playing this game. It's a tilt board to move the cube. 1 2 3 4
B008J1Q1R8|5.0|As the author states in the introduction this is an unapologetically positive account of the role the 1995 Rugby World Cup played in assisting the peaceful transfer of power from minority white (apartheid) rule to majority rule in South Africa. What comes shining through is the political wisdom, even genius, of Nelson Mandela (and a few other ANC figureheads come out with great credit too). This story shows that when human beings have a communal cause they can overcome even deeply entrenched enmity and in the process become closer, and even heal a divided nation.<br /><br />South Africa has faced serious challenges since, and its democracy doesn't look quite so rosy now to this outsider, but one hopes that the astonishing example that Mandela gave will not be lost when he will soon surely pass away.<br /><br />We have enough cynical political analysis in our lives. Open your heart to this account and believe in the ability of human beings to forgive great injustices and unite as one people under a shared history.
B0086700CM|5.0|This little intensive game is fun to play.  I'm still in the novice stage. I play it everyday. 1 2
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is entertaining but the amount of money it takes for some of the purchases is outrageous.  u will spend lots of time repeating the tasks
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This little thing is magnetic and attaches tightly to both the Mac and the power adaptor.  Does what it says!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|The game is interesting and fun to put the pictures together.  Some puzzles are very easy and some more complex.  A couple times after putting together many pictures I left the game and when I went back to play there was only a black screen, game gone.  I then had to reload game. Not sure if glitch in game or problem with my kindle fire.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what it says it does. It's very easy to set up me being new to kindle was so simple. Have not had any problems what do ever. If only all apps worked this well.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Finally downloaded this last night, and played it way longer than I should have on a school night!! A great, fun, exciting game... Even better, if not, better than the first one!<br />  But the only bad thing, for me, is that the game won't load and go to the main menu, so I can't play any more... Were this not to happen, I'd be killing the battery on my kindle fire!!<br />  Hopefully it works, and I think they should eventually add more characters!!<br />  Happy running, and may you not have the same problems as me! :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The acting is thee best I've seen, by everyone. What an interesting peek into the CIA and mental illness.  Looking forward to the next season.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its ok but them put the power ups were u cant reach unless u crash that is scrappy the guy is slow and doesn't go side 2 side very fast the games is ok but that's why I gave it 3 stars try it 4 ur self

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have it on the kindle fire and it is one of my favorite picture editor apps. I use it all the time.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|great cd. I received it quickly. I recommend and plan to purchase more in the future. thanks a lots.  smiles
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I waited for a while before i bought this book as I wanted to read the firstbook again to see if I missed anything. I felt the same about it afterwards. I prefer this book over the first as I feel the characters more this time. I did shed a few tears at one point when Ana was going thru the period of separation from Christian. That was one of the best part of the book and how it evolved. Their bedroom encounters were more meaningful. I wondered where it was going as I did notsee how she could have shattered her wants and needs for Christian any more.It got a bit boring after that and in the mid secton of the book. I am not sure I will bother to read the last book ...maybe in the fall.
1407130366|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy. An excellent read. Now suffering withdrawal symptoms! The rest of the family are now enjoying it.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I rejected the similar Atkins diet 10 years ago as a fad. I wish I hadn't. It took this book to convince me  to really reduce carbs. Prior to this I got moderate health gains on the Low Gi diet. After reading and following  the advice in this book my health improved so much more. Lost even more body fat & feel so much better- not  persistently tired any more! (I was eating way too much sugar and croissants). Luv this Book! Thanks - Gary Taubes!,,,HOWEVER...    I followed the advice in this book for 2 years. Well once I reached a healthy weight, I looked slender with my clothes on, but flabby with my clothes off! Mainly because I felt calm and with just enough energy to walk/stroll all day long...but I never had enough energy to do exercise more intense than that. & I usually love to exercise harder but I just couldn't!    This Gary Tuabes diet worked magic on my husband! He went from overweight to dropping 4 belt sizes and just being a healthy weight! I however got greedy and wanted to take it to the next level and become very toned as well as slim.    I just could not get past this plateu! I remained slim yet flabby while on this diet and If I forced myself to do basic weight lifting or even dancing or anything other than walking , afterwards I felt exhausted!    I also tried the Atkins diet ( which is very similar ) and even went Ketogenic (which Gary Taubes does not recommend) and I don't recommend it either...Going KETO made me utterly weak and only able to walk for exercise.    I wanted to get the enjoyable rush from high energy exercise again but only one thing gave me that energy back...  CARBS! I Carefully re-introduced 1/4 then later 1/2 a cup of rice carbs to my meals (even more was recommended by Author Paul Jaminette of \\"The perfect Health Diet\\". But guess what... I got my energy back, and was able to do high energy exercise but I got fat! Now I was a fit energetic chubby female!    I blamed the carbs & promptly reduced them and promptly became slimmer with no energy once again.  Keep in mind...My husband did just fine on this type of diet. He didn't suffer lower energy levels like me, but then he has no interest in exercise at all, nor does he care about being a little flabby. He is just happy to be a healthy weight now with his little layer of flab.    I however wanted oh... the body I had when I was 20 years old. Slim and toned!    So finally I read a book called: \\"The Samurai Diet\\" by Nate Miyaki. And I am getting that slim toned body back very quickly! The secret was going Moderate-carb AND LOW FAT! When I switched back to eating more carbs and getting more exercise, I got fat (and fit) because I kept the fat consumption high while eating more carbs because low carb diets encourage eating a lot of FAT! (including paleo low carb which i was doing).    \\"The Samurai Diet\\" book explains why low-carb diets work for people like my husband, AND It explains why Moderate carb diets work for those who love to exercise like me...but cutting back on the fat made the difference!    Apparently fat and carbs don't go together. Which Gary Taubes points out in this book.    My conclusion...This low-carb style of eating outlined in the book worked wonderfully for my husband and many friends of mine who were overweight. They became a slimmer healthier weight and have maintained it.    But if you have loftier ambitions (ie: looking great in a bikini - slim and toned with no flab & perky bunns) consider \\"The Samurai Diet\\" by Nate Miyaki
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is a feel good story with a lot of heart much like the Painted House and Calico Joe. It was a great read that kept me turning pages.  I would definitely recommend it.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|work perfect for a home pc all day long whit no lag or any problem intel the best processor actualy in the marcket
0425252868|5.0|A wonderful look inside the Luftwaffe and the ideals of its pilots.  Well written and captivating throughout.  I recommend it for anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Its not just about the sex. This was very well written. I loved the story. I heard reviews from people like dr. Drew saying this book was poorly written. Well I say what does he know. i thought it was an awesome read. Any women would love the story in this book. I recommend this ti anyone.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you're like me and lamented the end of the 50 Shades Series then this is a good book for you.  The similarities are uncanny.  The writing is atrocious, but if you're a 50 Shades fan that isn't a problem for you either :)<br /><br />It's a hot book, very hot!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the first 2 it was important to finish the trilogy. This was not as good as the first story.  The ending seemed to abrupt. She could have probably wrote another short book to finish a better ending. I did love the entire story though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While entertaining, it didn't rise to the level of The Hunger Games.  If you enjoyed the characters in the original book, this sequel expands on them and is gripping in many sections.  I would buy it again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Can't believe this was a free game!  A definite must try for any HO fan.  I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was the first Lee Child book for me.  It was exciting tale, bigger than life.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because there was too much violence for me. I ordered this book based on reviews by other readers.l
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|I started eregon on the recommendation  of my middle school son.  After I started I was more than happy to read the entire series.  The story line is fantastic and the authors thoughts on how magic is used in his world is both innovative and refreshing.  Brisingr is an appropriate title for this part and it very nicely sets the stage for the ultimate show down that you know has to come.  I would recommend this series to anyone that loves a good story and or this genera.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|You've got to love Rebus! He's at his best here. I think he's a little more vulnerable in this book. You can't help but love him warts and all. Great story as always.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Wasn't sure when I started it, but really liked it.<br />Thought it was a little wordy at times, but still a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome. Just awesome. I liked when snow died. Prim died, it's pretty sad to me. She didn't deserve to die.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well written in the usual and Stephen King style. Over the years, I have read almost everything written by Mr. King, and not once experienced disappointment.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has been around for centuries and always a gamble depending where the cards fall and fun to play with who knows who, but always a nice break from the rat race
B009WO7NQO|4.0|all the good things of angry birds with a twist. I really enjoy playing this game. I just have trouble remembering which one does what.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this. What a great why to just take the challenge. When you advance to another level, just get better
B003ODIZL6|5.0|5 it is a very good book  I liked how it showed me all the he things I need to learn and I would recommend this book to my friend Dylan ,Danielle,Breanna,Brandon,Carmen,mom,dad my grandmother phyis
B009X01D9U|2.0|This doesn't fold down well in portrait mode like some of the other tablet cases. Others have a fold part way on the one side so you can angle the screen more upward - hard to describe. This would work well if viewing on a table while sitting down, but if you're laying in bed or something & want it pointed more up, this isn't your thing. Also, the rotating feature was a little wonky & overall it felt too big & chunky in my hands.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a book for serious readers. At times it is hilarious, at other times it's gut wrenchingly sad, and throughout it is completely enthralling. I looked forward to sitting down to read it like I would look forward to seeing a new movie or going to a famous restaurant, and I was never disappointed. I loved it!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I quite enjoy their sound.  The first 6 songs on the CD are quite good (Time To Pretend, Electric Feel, Kids, etc.).  The last couple of songs I don't like but the CD is worth the price.
B00742BVW8|5.0|Full movie. High quality. The translation was really good, considering that my mother tongue is Chinese. Sound effect was really good as well.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Love Florence...her voice is haunting...in a good way! I would highly reccommend this title to anyone that is a fan of Tori Amos.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read most of the Harry Bosch Novels and enjoy all of them. Always look forward for new books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the first book so I purchased Book Two and Three, now I am just waiting on the movie so I can compare
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game because it's so fun and a great challenge for anyone that wants to pass time. I now know what not to put at the bottom of my grocery bag! Rampage mode defiantly my favorite, love breaking things.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|the movie was great action pack, but it was over before you realized what happened, if you got up for a drinl or blinked you missed it. A dull ending; I am looking forward to the next movie; can't wait.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The way i like to stay up to date.  Beautiful interface that is very intuitive.  Plugs right into my google reader feed.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My daughter thought this was great movie and nice to have Blue Ray and Digital copies. Shipped on time and no flaws with package.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is an awesome game and app I am so addicted to this game and every were I go I always have this game with me love it
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I buy almost all of Fincher's movies because I find that his special features are always so all encompassing.  The girl with the dragon tattoo is no different.  You can watch for 2 hours and realize you're still in the pre-production part of it with still production and post-production to go.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For everyone who has drank too much and wondered what they did.  A great getaway from reality and keeps your interest.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amaaaaazzzzzing app I love it its just like having a horse and is better than the apple version<br />really great a must get

B003F3NDWG|5.0|Bought these for my wife.  She likes it.  I've onlky seen a few minutes of several episodes, it appears to be well written, but having never followed the platt, I am totaly lost.  But my wife likes it, and thats what counts.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played many G5 games and especially loved special enquiry detail, but never found another game that quite pulled me in like that one. Until now! :) This game is fun and addicting. I love actually getting to do &quot;hands on&quot; stuff in the game. I will admit this one made me jump once or twice!
B0085YNML2|4.0|Nice app for young kids or if your bored. I played it about 15 minutes then gave up.  My kids can pay it for hours.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is officially one of my favorite books. You start out thinking that hopeless is another wonderfully written love story when everything gets so turned upside down. Ever had a book that you would rather be sleepy at work the next morning than to put it down? Well this is the one.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Bought these for my wife.  She likes it.  I've onlky seen a few minutes of several episodes, it appears to be well written, but having never followed the platt, I am totaly lost.  But my wife likes it, and thats what counts.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was working fine but when I try to play after leaving to home it starts to work, then it goes back to my home menu. Though while it was working it was awesome. A big improvement to the 1st Temple Run.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Bought these for my wife.  She likes it.  I've onlky seen a few minutes of several episodes, it appears to be well written, but having never followed the platt, I am totaly lost.  But my wife likes it, and thats what counts.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|I JUST HAD HEARDED ONE SONG OF THIS CD, THAT SOUNDED GOOD AND I TOOK THE DESICION OF BUY THIS CD. ALL THE SONGS HAS THE SPIRIT THAT CHARACTERIZE  GARBAGE . ITS A CD THAT YOU COULD HEARD ANYTIME ANYWHERE. 100 % RECOMMENDED.
B005HSL626|5.0|Game is fun and the kids and grand children love it, easy to learn and they little ones can play it.
B000089RV6|5.0|This CD is a clasic in the history of the rock and roll. Now , finally I could buy this cd. The music is absolutely fantastic. Totally recommended
B00699XMCO|5.0|Five star it was an easy read and kept interest of child really enjoyed the story<br />And relaxation and time spent with child
B006ZT47O0|5.0|THE VOICE OF THE FEMALE SINGER IS INCREDIBLE, THE MUSIC OF THE OTHER TEAMMATES IS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY QUALITY. NOW I BECAME INTO A FANATIC OF EPICA. 100% RECOMMENDED
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the contrast between personalities upstairs and downstairs, as well as the lifestyle of the different layers of society and time period.
B002KREVCO|5.0|The first time I saw this item was in the tv program &#34;That metal show&#34;. The 2cds and the dvd provide me of hours of material for listen. There are many songs that I never had listened, and was exciting hear the voice of Bon Scott in those old songs and the voice of brian in somme ucommon tracks. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was wonderfully written and makes you wonder... For those soft at heart, this book is a nice read.
B007SY3CEW|1.0|Like every other app I've paid for on Amazon, I paid for the app but it never loaded.  I work in Information Systems for a living and if I can't figure out how to load an app I can only imagine what others go through.<br /><br />For some reason the free apps load and work GREAT!  My recomendation is to go with the free apps and don't buy any!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was completely overwhelmed when it came time to format my book for kindle, but this book made it all so simple. A quick read.
0679809015|4.0|good am like we read togeter he love to read this book good book for kid good very good book
B006IV19LY|5.0|How Edward Norton didn't walk away with an Academy Award after this movie is beyond my comprehension. Warning: it is extremely violent, has brutality at every level AND should not be missed. Certain scenes still haunt me years later. As effective as Schindler's List in exposing the terrors of prejudice, this film didn't get the recognition it should have, and still doesn't.<br />I'm deadly serious, I think this should be required watching in every high school. Walk in someone else's skin. Knowledge is power. Let  kids see the big picture as individual stories (which of course they are) and it will open them up to truth.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|In my busy life, this app saved me sooo much money by price comparing right in the store. If you need help saving money, you have to have this app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series. It shows what life was like back then and over there. Strong cast, great storyline.
B007V65R54|4.0|Great book!  If you enjoy statistics then this book is for you.  Interesting perspectives from weather to baseball.  Do read
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't wait to see movie. It's going to be fun to compare details from book to the movie. Great twist at the end
B00631VJIC|5.0|Love the show and the music. I ordered the CD along with a preorder of another item so I won't get the CD until the other item is available (I believe), but with Autorip I was able to download and play the music immediately. My only complaint (against myself) is that when I first added it to my cart, the price was $9.99 and by the time I actually ordered it, the price had gone up $2. It's still a good buy.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|Can't get it to down load on my kindle fire. Would like my money back if I can't. get it to down load.
0713998989|1.0|The first problem with Diamond's book is that he uses contemporary tribal peoples (of which, in most cases, he has absolutely no first-hand experience) to tell us (the industrialised West) how we used to live. It's nonsense - the notion that today's tribal peoples are in some way a relic of the past has not only been debunked by many scientists, it is also extremely dangerous to the survival of those peoples. The second problem is that he extrapolates wildly from highly questionable data, positing as scientific fact the violent nature of tribal peoples. This he uses to justify his belief that they welcome the imposition of the state. It's the old rhetoric of colonialism and `pacification of the savages' dressed up as science. Were he to be believed, it risks pushing the advancement of human rights for tribal peoples back decades.<br /><br />Survival International - the organisation fighting for the rights of tribal peoples worldwide since 1969 - will shortly release a critique of Diamond.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|To me, this book and its sequel are the most enjoyable books I've had the good fortune to come across. They're full of wit, action, enthusiasm, and above all, they cause a great amount of anticipation of large and terrible events forthcoming in the story. I first read this book about four months ago, and am now on the fourth or fifth rereading of  it and its sequel. Even now I still find tidbits, hints, and other things I did not notice before, and can't help but admire the complexity of this book and its sequel (and hopefully its sequel yet to come). In short, if you bothered to read this review and still are not inclined to at least attempt perusal of The Name of the Wind, I simply sorrow for your loss.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Been trying to find this movie for a long time and really am getting tired of all the words I have to put in the reviews
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I still am amazed at how much I enjoy this book. Since it's a sequel, I shall simply say it does nothing but add to the exhilarating tale begun in The Name of the Wind. All those who have read the first should certainly continue with the second.
0385344333|5.0|Can't wait for the next one.  Glad to see he's preety much going in order.  Too bad they have that runt playing Reacher..Liam Mielson might have been good.  Maybe a little old, but everythinng else would have been a better match.  I've seen the trailers and Cruise seems to caputer the attitude, but I have a hard time getting past the size issue
B0012NO316|5.0|It's great to have access to movies anytime, anywhere, as long as I have my iPad. This was my first rental and I was happy with the whole experience. Fantastic movie, too!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have heard about Angry Birds for years. My grandchildren play it on their mom's phone. Now I finally have the game on my new Kindle. It is addictive.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I watch this one over and over because it's one of those sweet, funny movies where dislike is often a cover for secret liking and then something happens and voila! it's love.  Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make a cute couple and Betty White rocks!
B001ECE6C6|5.0|This is the 35th Pat Metheny CD to be added to my collection of about 500+ overall. I listened to for the first time yesterday. Yikes I am mad at myself for not getting this one a long time ago. Anyway, it is great because now I have new Pat to listen to which there is never enough of. I probably listen to an average of 1 Pat CDs a day, so this will help. Metheny's music helps me focus on my work. I am grateful for his works over the past 35 or so years. This is a must have if you are into Metheny. Adding Anna 11 years ago for this 2002 recording adds an element we have not seen before and is quite possible won't happen again. Looking forward to the next PMG tour!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|If you've ever been to Paris you have to see this.  Movie is great fun (Owen Wilson is the new Woody Allen) but the photography of Paris makes it worth owning this movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is so deep. I loved everything, especially story about Kaladin. It was so tempting that I read its part in advance, before I read other characters.<br /><br />I really recomend it for all lovers of Fantasy.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|What is it with stories about ballet that they always have to be so bleak.  I'd prefer more clarity on what was happening.  At any rate, a vastly overrated movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Input lag on swipes (turns, jumps, etc). Sometimes swipes don't even register. Fix this and you'll have a fine sequel.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|A friend recommended this to me -- can't believe I never watched it  Everything in it was right on.  I'm just thankful I never worked there.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book held my interest for a while but everyone in it was just too perfect.....except of course the evil husband...It wasn't like one of those books you just can't put down until you get to the end.  It was just too much like Sleeping with the Enemy (even included a ferris wheel scene) & The twist at the end was just too far fetched for me.....just plain sappy.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is a great movie.  Read the book as well after seeing the movie.  There's alot more that could have been in the movie but what is important is there.  Nelson Mandela is truly an inspriation for all people.  To forgive your oppressors and to want to unite them them shows that people with integrity and faith in truth and goodness can survive to lead us.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Always have been a fan of Fleetwood Mac. Groups of this era of music have real talent. Plus Stevie Nix rocks.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  My daughter recommended this to me and we watched on HBO.  I was hooked.  Claire Danes is outstanding as Temple.  What inspiration Temple's parents were in a time when conforming to a norm was the norm; to take a stand against those doctors who wanted to put her away.  At any rate, this is keeper.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book a lot more than the first one. I liked the character development and the plot. I couldn't put it down.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|First one is still better. This one makes you feel noxious.<br /><br />Turing is harder. The only good part is the zipline and the mine.<br /><br />It's a good thing it's free cause I wouldn't buy it ever!!!
140053271X|5.0|I bought myself the Nook Simple Touch ebook reader for Christmas and I'm so pleased that I did.  This model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the others Nooks but, in my opinion, you don't need them.<br /><br />A note about battery life - it's amazing!  I'm an avid reader and have only charged the Nook ONCE since Christmas (it's now late January).  I didn't believe the battery life claim I read in the item description but it's true.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny,laughing out loud, I don't know what to say except another hilarious Jeff Kinney book! Jeff Kinney, never stop making more!
B005VPSEK2|4.0|I used to love Kelly, but a lot of her stuff sounds the same to me after a while.  I like about half the songs on this new album.  I have to skip some of them and not listen straight through, though.  My favorite new song of hers is Catch My Breath, not even on this album.  Check it out!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this app even though the guy is not that fast i still love it thanks for making this app and temple run the first one thank your y so much this is the only app i play on my kindle
B005UA0FLE|5.0|It's impossible to go wrong with Michael Buble.  He's amazing, wonderful, fabulous... I love all his arrangements.  Tis album is the perfect addition to my small, picky Christmas collection.  :)
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I feel very easy to catch. up and is better. and if I forget what is happenings. in my life and I can count on for days
B00973CGXK|5.0|I absolutely adore this new sound from the Killers!!  I never liked their radio music before, but I heard them perform one of these songs on The Voice and looked it up, and was pleasantly surprised by the whole album.<br /><br />It sounds more like a classic rock album with a modern twist, not that pinky stuff they used to do.  Many of the songs are melodic.  I listen to this album all the time now!  Love it!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This self published novel reads as if it were written by a 12 year old, with very little knowledge of medieval life, weapons and warfare. Characters are paper thin and cookie cutter - noble hero child, evil prince with shifty, darting eyes, beautiful princess, stalwart companion, etc. Plot inconsistencies are rampant: sheep herder father can afford gilded weapons for 3 of his sons. Large distances are crossed on foot in short amounts of time. After pretty much no training, novice soldiers are sent into dangerous, enemy territory. A knight in full plate armour is apparently at risk of death from a spear head thrown at his chest. The main character forms instant, powerful connections with other people, and animals.<br /><br />If an author is going to write a novel set in a medieval/fantasy milieu that focuses on warfare, they should first spend some time researching a) weapons, b) how one learns to use said weapons, c) the relationship between a knight and a squire. One does not master the use of a sword in an afternoon, or learn to throw a wide variety of weapons at a distant target in a few hours. One does not put on plate armour in the space of a few seconds.<br /><br />The writing style is painful to read, with typographic and grammatical errors throughout. Turns of phrase are often cringe-worthy. And the \\"romance\\" aspect is especially laughable - seriously, it really appears to be written by a child.<br /><br />It's mind boggling to consider that some reviewers give this 5 stars. One really has to wonder what qualifies as a 2 star review in their world.<br /><br />And for the love of god, one does not quaff ale from a cask, nor hold one in one's hand! Learn the difference between a flagon/mug/cup and a cask!<br /><br />Update: I should add that this is the first digital book that I have ever returned to Amazon. They did not have a category for \\"horrible writing\\", so I used \\"defective product\\". They had no problem refunding the purchase price.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Like all Nicholas Sparks books, this one has a happy ending.  While I like the lead female character, I was a little disappointed that she let fear take over her life.  I wish she was stronger and took control over her life-like Jennifer Lopez did in &#34;Enough.&#34;  Overall a nice read.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I don't know how this book came to my Kindle but I'm sure glad it did. I didn't even know what it was about when I started to read but it sucked me in quickly. It was such a well written story. The narrative flowed easily, with the right amount of description and setting to feel a part of the story. The romance was near-perfect, though the constant ping-ponging between love and hate did get a bit drawn out after a while. I will admit, though, it's how college kids are in real life, so I can't fault the author too much for that. I really enjoyed the story and at the end, I was flipping pages so quickly to see what happened I thought my Kindle would catch on fire! I can't wait to read the trilogy McGuire has out. I hope it holds to the same standard as Beautiful Disaster.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This is by far the most beautiful album I've heard in many years, and easily the best album of 2012. Complex, unique, just magnificent.<br /><br />Here are just a few highlights:<br />Intro - A kick in the pants opening, and perhaps the rawest sounding song on an otherwise incredibly well-polished album.<br />Interlude 1 - Haunting poetry makes for a strangely inviting if not typical singalong.<br />Tesselate - Features sexy jazzy beats and a chill melody. First time you realize Joe Newman's vocals know no limits.<br />Breezeblocks - First time you realize these guys are nuts. Thom Green rocks the drums in an absolutely bone-chilling ending to this song.<br />Interlude 2 - A nonchalant instrumental guitar short that feels almost improvised. The interludes are all very well-positioned and well-timed.<br />Matilda - Guitar/drums remind me of The National. And that is elite company to be in, in my book.<br />Estocada - Soaring choruses lead to soothing verses.<br />MS - An excellent addition to your &#34;night drive&#34; playlist.<br />Fitzpleasure - Turn it up. Seriously. Then go smash something. How can a song be this raw and yet so beautiful?<br />Blood Flood - Those sexy jazzy beats are back. Good too, since you probably needed something to calm down at this stage.<br />Taro - The song that'll make you fall in love with this album. Capa's is quite a story on its own, but what a way to put it into song.<br /><br />I bought concert tickets before I even finished the album.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I have read all of Albom's books except Tuesdays with Morrie.  Of the four I've read, this was my least favorite.  Its plot was more predictable, but having said that, I still highly recommend it.  Although it was my least favorite, it was still a wonderful, thought-provoking read!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|great read,very informative, a real eyeopener when it comes to the good and the bad our former presidents have done and continued to do even after leaving office. i was especially shocked to find out how many wars were waged and prolonged by them just for their own political gains.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Download and take control. Immediate response video once it is downloaded rather than the lag when trying to watch and jump around the video when trying to watch online.
B00B0U2SEA|2.0|What are the extras?  There's no listing of any here, except mention of a documentary about survivors helped by Schindler.  The running time of the Blu-Ray is 392 minutes, which means there are approximately 3 1/2 hrs. of extras in addition to the running time of the film.  It's ridiculous to announce such a release without including what's on it; otherwise, how can potential buyers know what they're buying?  (The low rating I'm giving is not for the film, which is a masterpiece, but for the announcement.)
0446580848|5.0|Good read from the start of the book. Could barely put it down. Love all his books. Recommended to friends and Family.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The author kept me caught up in this tale and wanting good things to happen.<br />I really liked the way she kept me wanting more and her use of words kept me a part of the story till the very end.<br />Would advise anyone to read it again and realize how life has its redeeming factors.
0385535147|5.0|Good story easy to read and very interesting held my attention. Recommend this book to friends and family. Thank you.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This new version is fun and more difficult thwn the original. However, even after turning the graphic quality down the game often lags, causing you to die. Additionally, I tried to resurrect and it crashed, which was annoying because I had just completed an achievement. The game still needs some work.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I have seen this movie with my grandchildren and we loved it but I saw it at the theater when it came out.  I don't recall ordering it.  If I did, it would have been by accident.
B006LSZECO|3.0|What is the literary term for when an author strings together two-plots from B-movies and pretends it a new story?<br /><br />Well, that is what happened in this novel.  Gillian Flynn's writting skills reflect her time spent as a journalist.  She communicates setting and plot with the efficiency of a columinist which often results in telegraphing the plot.  For example, what type of women constructs complicated games based on historical cues tucked away in strange places?  Obviously, not a women who simply disappears (as in she has never done anything simplly in her life).<br /><br />Nevertheless, Ms. Flynn does an admirable job of describing the role of 'the girl who likes sex'.  It is akin to the depth of emotion she used to describe piglets being ripped from the sow's teats.  Both were enough to put you off sex and bacon for a long time.<br /><br />I think other readers will find the book a bit too long (one hestiates to use the word overdrawn).  Characters like these need to be allowed to kill themselves off quickly so that we can learn about the ones that actually might change during the course of the book.<br /><br />Pacey enough for airport reading but low on the 'Crime and Punishment' scale.<br /><br />djc
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love it.  I am not finished because I have been off-line for a bit but back now and hope to finish the episodes tonight.  Great viewing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me busy on my down time. You really don't have to be a serious gamer to play this game successfully.
1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves this series and I am enjoying it along with him.  I have read all of the books so far and have laughed out loud in parts.  Great series for young and 'young at heart'.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a wonderful app.  Have it on my andriod telephone also.  We have a home in North Carolina and also in Alabama, and I can get instant up-to-date information on both locations in just a few seconds.  Highly recommend this application.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Ho hum. Tried as I might, just couldnt force myself to finish the first book. Friends say the second was better and it all became clear in the last book. But lifes too short for boring books. I gave up
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This was a very good movie with amazing stars.  Enjoyed watching it very much, and the graphics were awesome.<br />Would recommend highly.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I can play it on my pc or computer but on kindle? Now I can even play on the bus ride from school! The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't make rollercoaster. Also because you can

B00A0SQBDM|3.0|This would have been an excellant game if the setting had not been so dark, morbid and gross.  It was full of the dark arts.  The story ended on a good note though.  I really liked the way the game was designed just not the setting.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A completely different experience from the stage show but, in many ways, even better.  Perfect cast (even Crowe, who plays and sings it almost without emotion, which suits Javert).
1932907009|5.0|If you are looking to learn storyline, this is great. The book doesn't talk about formatting or selling a piece. It is still full of good info.
B00A1AD6ZU|2.0|According to my Kindle, I'm 53% into this book. Amazed I made it this far. Stereotypical characters, contrived tension, tedious writing, ridiculously long stretches of dialogue constructed solely to provide back story. Like other readers, I was taken in by the blurb. I haven't read James Rollins before and doubt I will again.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a fun hidden object game with puzzles and an interesting story. There are not enough games like these that keep my attention. I cannot wait for the sequel.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was a good read. It fell short of the 5th star because I didn't care much for the ending.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham and now my 10 year old son can too. We take turns reading aloud and we love that it teaches about our judicial system with a great plot as well. We have read 2 in the series so far and are looking forward to the next!
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I can't rate Last of the Dogmen.  I didn't realize it wouldn't play in my DVD,  so it is still just sitting.  I didn't try to play it until summer<br />and It of course didn't work. We couldn't figure out what was wrong.  It says in real small letters region 2 on the DVD case and it took us awhile to find that and then it took us awhile to figure out what it meant.  I would send it back to you.  It hasn't been played.<br />I have tried to find one that will play in my dvd but I don't want to pay $100.00 for one.  the other DVD was good.

B004NNUZ5K|4.0|This book is fantastic. This guy makes mixing easier to understand and gives really great tips! This book has helped me tremendously but you will need a more in depth book if you want/need more.<br /><br />This book is a great place to start!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|i love this movie got everyone of the how set. would buy more if they made them i love them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great service. I got to watch the episode right away! This show is really great too! Quality is really good!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series is truly amazing and makes twilight a distant memory. I would recommend this book to anyone!!! Great read
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Drama, violence, and sex all in one great package.<br /><br />It was a great idea to do a prequel from the perspective of the house of Batiatis.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Its really fun. Some of the puzzles can actually be a challenge but the majority of them are super easy.only really fun when you get ti the 10x10 or higher.
B005LAII80|4.0|NOT recommended for viewing by children, but it is a good movie for adults if you don't mind a lot of blood and killing effects.<br />As in other customer reviews, this was our second  Dredd 3D that Amazon had to send to replace the first one which did NOT play in 3D.  This second one DOES show in 3D, but on first showing you may have to start it in 3D, then if it only shows in 2D, press stop, then power down your 3D Blu Ray player, then power back up.  Press &#34;NO&#34; if prompted to resume playback, then start from the beginning of the disc for 3D. This seems to have solved the problem for me.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it stinks it is not free if it was free I would love it change. it to free I peg. you
B0053O89RY|4.0|I have really enjoyed &#34;Modern Family,&#34; especially watching the various side relationships that have developed between the characters.  It's tough to beat the first season, but this one isn't bad.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Brad Pit does an excellent job, we consider it one of his best.  Jonah Hill does well also.  We recommend it to anyone who enjoys baseball.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|My wife and I have really enjoyed this film.  Good action flick that you can just throw in, sit back, and be entertained.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|the English actors are superb.  The storyline about retirees is great.  We recommend it to anyone approaching the age of retirement.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was remotely aware of this novel when it first came out. I ignored it. Then they made a movie, and I ignored it, but it made me think about the novel so I finally read it. Should have read it long ago. It's a great story with a great twist at the end.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Not one of Bruce Willis' best.  He plays a retired &#34;wet ops&#34; CIA man, and for some reason, the CIA is now set o terminate his retirement... and his life.  Why?  And when this affects his love interest and his old partners, it's time to get some payback.<br /><br />Classic wounded Willis, with some surprising costars making appearances.  It's just the action plot of revenge following a setup is a bit overplayed.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Lee Child breaks a primary rule of writing by covering a subject that he knows nothing about. As a Briton, it is understandable  that he knows nothing about firearms, rural America, or the American criminal justice system. What is unforgivable is that he did little or no research into those subjects before attempting to write a detective novel against the back-drop of a small town police station in rural America with lots of detailed &#34;gun play.&#34; I have been a firearms enthusiast all my life, have lived in small town rural America (Pennsylvania, not Georgia) all my life, and have been the criminal prosecutor in my county for last five years. So, Child's cluelessness was duly noted.<br /><br />Detective novels are not on my usual reading menu. I thought it would be fun to go &#34;slumming&#34; for once. I figured this series must have something going for it, after all Hollywood made a movie based on the Jack Reacher stories. Mistake.
0061692034|3.0|I listened to this book while driving long distances. The problem with audio books is that one cannot just scan fast over a paragraph that sound repetitious or overly detailed. And this novel's both triumphs and pitfalls are these repletions of the microscopic details. The reader (or listener) gets to live development of the family's tragedy--the parents' irresponsible robbery of a bank--minute by minute.<br /><br />Ford's prose carried me for many hours, until the protagonist, a teenage boy, was whisked away to Canada after his parents' arrest. This happened half-way through my set of CDs. With the introduction of the colorful character with whom the boy would now live, my interest waned and my patience with the details reached its end. I may have continued reading a printed or digital format, rushing through sections and editing out portions in order to get on with the story, but could not do so in the audio version. I simply could not see putting in so many more tedious hours, as good has the author's prose was.<br /><br />I would have given the first part of the book 5 stars, and the second only 2 as it failed to hold my attention....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does not disappoint. He has a knack for making fantasy seem perfectly plausible because of meticulous research into the time and place to which his fantasy transports us.
0307700879|5.0|I don't know how to describe what it is that mostly fascinates me about this book. The poetry-like writing, the descriptions, the characters... For a guy that mostly reads fiction and science fiction, this book came really like a surprise. I read it after a friend suggested it to me and let me tell you I did not regret doing that. It was a bit difficult to read (being Greek) because of its writing, but it was well worth it. I especially liked the 'Desert' Chapters.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I really like Clint Eastwood and this video did not disappoint.  He always does a great job in whatever movie he directs or stars in and this was excellent.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan, but this movie really showed me how great his movies can be. The cast is amazing, the locations stunning and the script... just captivating. Allen captures the nostalgic feel of Paris perfectly. And I know that no explanation is given for time travel and that Inez's (Gil's fiance) family and ex are practically caricatures, but the movie is a bit surrealistic and that just adds to the overall experience. Also despite all the nostalgia in this film, it doesn't end on a sour note but rather a hopeful one. Just a wonderful movie, one of my top 10.
B00785P2QC|3.0|need to add factory prices to goals and allow the option. to purchase items for city at any time not just during goals.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this one kept me guessing the graphics are great. give it a go. i am going<br />to purchase the extended  version because the intro version has me intrigued.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|Love the title tune, Bridge Over Troubled Water! One of the most beautiful songs ever written and Garfunkel's rendition is amazing!  Great listening on the road - love these oldies.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Too much build up and too little action. After a while John Corey's smart aleck humor gets boring.  I enjoyed DeMille's other books more.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Moyes presents extremely controversial moral issues in this well written novel. The reader is drawn into the main character's lives from the very start. Beautifully and thoughtfully written.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the subject matter.  The author did a good job developing the character of our heroine, and explained her character flaws so the reader was aware of the background.  The story never dragged.  Probably, I would recommend this book for women and some sensitive men, but I really don't think too many men would pick this.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|I love Nemo.  I was go glad to see it go back on the shelves in time for xmas.....Adults and children will all love Nemo........just keep swimming....just keep swimming.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|well it is a great game great graphics what isnt there to like its a great sequal to temple run
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I think the best action sequences were shown on the commercial. Two really great actors, but a terrible, terrible movie.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|my 4 year old loves cats and once in a while we use this just to be silly. It does just what it says in the description. It's not really a game, but it is a cool tool or app to use for short video recordings.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Charlie is such an amazing character. This book has a very real element of truth to it and it's definitely a good read.

B0031TZASY|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this novel; totally my genre, great reviews, etc. but, this happens to be one of those cases where the book doesn't match up to the hype. I am a complete sucker for survival novel, I just felt this one lacked a climax, or detail. It's alright if a novel doesn't have a peak, but in that case it should make me feel like I'm living every day with the character, which it didn't. It also didn't make me believe in God, as the first chapter promised. However, I am very glad that a fellow Canadian has received such recognition.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|Great product!  Excellent service!  Love the music!  : )  Keep making great music, Backstreet Boys!  : )  : )  : )

B000LTAY1U|4.0|Batteries in my old watch died on me right after I got to Afghanistan and I figured instead of ordering batteries and messing with it I'd rather try a new watch that doesn't need batteries. I used this for the rest of my deployment and It held up very well. It runs fast, but the reviews said that so I'm not that concerned. Better running a little ahead than a little behind. The band is getting a little scruffy after a year, but I think that's an acceptable lifespan (still works fine, just looks rough). Had it over a year now and still using it every day back home.

B00170M2JY|5.0|I'm usually not the sort who gets emotional while watching a movie, yet with every viewing of Cameron Crowe's JERRY MAGUIRE I always start crying during the scene where Marcee Tidwell (Regina King) thinks husband Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is seriously injured after a game-winning TD catch. These tears continue when Jerry (Tom Cruise) confronts wife Dorothy (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) at her sister-in-law's (Bonnie Hunt) house, during a divorced women's support group meeting. In front of all these ladies, recently-separated Jerry opens his heart to Dorothy. It's the tenderest of moments and the big pay-off to a great motion picture.<br />.<br /><br />Jerry Maguire is a likeable man in an industry of superficial phonies. As agent to a stable of elite athletes, he plays the insincerity game better than anyone, that is until a deeply suppressed conscience can no longer be ignored. A touchy-feely 25-page mission statement is the result, and this radical piece of honesty seems his undoing. In quick succession Jerry loses his job, all of his clients (save one) and his high-maintenance fianc&eacute;e.<br /><br />The story's most admirable character is Rod Tidwell, wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals. Flawed as we all are, in this case burdened with an inflated ego regarding his on-field talents, Rod is a rare human being: unswervingly true to his wife and the people he calls \\"friend.\\" It's the brotherly love of Rod that helps Jerry grow as a man, and the devoted husband that he obviously is that shows Jerry a truth he hasn't yet realized: that he is capable of loving another person more than himself.<br /><br />Two quotes from Jerry's sports agent mentor, Dicky Fox best sum up this story:<br /><br />Dicky Fox: \\"If this [points to heart] is empty, this [points to head] doesn't matter.\\"<br /><br />and, in the film's final lines:<br /><br />Dicky Fox: \\"Hey, I don't have all the answers. In life, to be honest, I failed as much as I have succeeded. But I love my wife. I love my life. And I wish you MY kind of success.\\"<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll ratings.<br /><br />(7.2) Jerry Maguire (1996) - Tom Cruise/Cuba Gooding Jr./Ren&eacute;e Zellweger/Kelly Preston/Jay Mohr/Bonnie Hunt/Jonathan Lipnicki/Glenn Frey/Donal Logue/Beau Bridges (cameos: Al Michaels/Dan Dierdorf/Frank Gifford/Drew Bledsoe/Katarina Witt/Mel Kiper/Drew Rosenhaus/Art Monk/Richie Kotite/Troy Aikman/Warren Moon/Kerry Collins/Dallas Malloy)sh you MY kind of success.\\"<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll ratings.<br /><br />(7.2) Jerry Maguire (1996) - Tom Cruise/Cuba Gooding Jr./Renée Zellweger/Kelly Preston/Jay Mohr/Bonnie Hunt/Jonathan Lipnicki/Glenn Frey/Donal Logue/Beau Bridges (cameos: Al Michaels/Dan Dierdorf/Frank Gifford/Drew Bledsoe/Katarina Witt/Mel Kiper/Drew Rosenhaus/Art Monk/Richie Kotite/Troy Aikman/Warren Moon/Kerry Collins/Dallas Malloy)
B00008MJ8H|5.0|THE STORY IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND THE CASTING IS GREAT!  I REALLY LOVE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC &#34;AMAPOLA&#34; AND OTHERS.  IT'S A LONG MOVIE, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MEANING TO IT!  I REALLY ENJOYED IT!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|If you have had a hard day be it at work or just in general it's nice being able to relax with sounds like an ocean wave or a grandfather clock counting down time while you relax.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good place to keep up with events going on on a daily basis.  A good place to find friends and family you never get to keep in touch with otherwise.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Hands down one of the best non fiction reads. A story I'm glad was told by someone involved. The author does an excellent job of drawing you right into the action and thrill it must be to do what these fine soldiers do day in and day out. Nothing but respect!

Also the whole reason I even paid for this app was to record videos but when I click camcorder it says it has stopped and doesn't work. The worst thing is that I have paid 99 cents for a piece of poo.

My body fat dropped from 21% to 9.5%, plus I no longer have the cyclic need to gorge on carbs every 2-3 hours.  It definitely improved my quality of life, as well as my wife's.  Wheat Belly is definitely a &#34;read and heed&#34; kind of book, that provides the knowledge to improve your health and quality of life.
