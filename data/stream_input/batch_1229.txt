B001A0KVVM|5.0|Joni's greatest single work, IMHO. I only had it on cassette for some reason and wanted it on LP. When moving West I shed all but 20 or so of my 5-600 LPs, and I still miss them. I won't ever rebuild the collection, but there are some I wish I'd kept. The seller was fantastic - arrived in a timely fashion and well packaged, in the condition advertised.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Technically a Sci-Fi movie, this movie is really a story of a father redeeming his relationship with a son he never knew, and of the character change that occurs in the father throughout the movie. The story is very well told, drawing you into the characters experiences, and although my wife loathes Sci-Fi movies, she loved this movie and cried during some scenes. It's got a lot action in it as well and is fun to watch. I do not watch many movies twice, but I'll be buying this movie and we'll be enjoying it repeatedly. The robot they prepare together serves as a device for a David and Goliath storyline as well. Hard to believe when reading this, but you'll be cheering for the father and son and their robot as well.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Wow, is all I can say! After a hiatus following the release of the Incident and the Blackfield tour, Steven has graced us with his most auspicious and challenging work to date. I must say that I am in awe with every listen. The warm sounds of this album washes over me like a tide of fresh water, ebbing over my head, trying to pull me under. This is music!   The album, like all SW albums, has a concept, although this one is not as straightforward as others. The album title refers to the peace one feels after a long struggle to keep from going under. What else in  life is like this? Well SW explores those areas on each gem, building up to a crescendo that slowly spirals back to earth like a drifting leaf.  The songs alternate between calm and chaos, not only between each other but also within some. Take the title track: a calm choral vocal and piano followed by Sectarian, which is chaotic in comparison using many different instruments. And thus it goes for the rest of this musical journey, til we land at Raider II, a tumultuous nightmare of a tune clocking in at over 20mins. This one sports it all: dark lyrics, menacing moog, creepy chorals, jazz riffs, explosive guitars, harmonious flutes, bombastic bass, and some really strange time signatures that alternate like the wind. Oh yeah,and also some quiet, achingly beautiful parts. This dark tune is followed again by the rather soothing, Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye with its ambient outro to close the album.  This is a fine prog-rock masterpiece, only added to by the media that accompanies it. I got the Deluxe edition, with a 120 page book of photos and lyrics that follow along with this odyssey. Also, the Blu-ray is not to be missed, and is quite honestly the best way to experience this journey. It offers 5.1 surround sound mix of the entire album plus short films, photo galleries, lyrics, bonus tracks, and demos. I cannot think of anyone else out there who has done something this auspicious and fully delivered.I cannot recommend this work of art enough!  [[ASIN:B005EXA8LY Grace For Drowning]]
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Most hard rock/metal bands are so boring these days, I can hardly be bothered to pay much attention to this genre anymore. However, Ghost is one of the bands who actually deserve the hype they are receiving nowadays. This is one of the BEST albums I have heard in years. Great songs, fantastic vocals and the band has a very distinct sound. This is the \\"buy or die\\" metal album of the decade! If I were to say anything negative about this release it would have to be that I wish it was longer. If it were a double album of this quality, it would still be too short. I can't wait to hear more from these guys!

B004D2GMR6|5.0|The DVD of \\"Bon Jovi: Live at Madison Square Garden\\" is great!  When I purchased it, I did not know what to expect.  I knew the music would be good.  I knew there would be plenty of hit songs. I knew the showmanship would be superior.  But, how would the sound be and would the music be drowned out by the huge crowd. The answers are: the sound was good and the crowd did not hurt the performance at all.  The DVD was like having a front row seat at a terrific concert and getting a super bargain price for the tickets.  This one is definitely one of my best buys ever.  Get it and enjoy!

0439023521|5.0|This book is incredible.  The character development is riveting and the plot is exciting.  I can't wait to read the second and third book in the trilogy!  And I can't wait for the movie to come out in Spring 2012!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I got it as a gift, and it was long overdue!! I wasn't able to see it in theaters when it came out, but I was able to watch it three times in a row at home!!!

The end leaves me wondering if there will be another Fast movie...............
B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch's third studio album American Capitalist firmly continues the formula which the band had established on their previous two releases, especially their sophomore release War Is The Answer. This 2011 album is comprised primarily three minute tracks full of bouncy riffs, flailing double kicks and a mixture or hard verses with radio choruses.<br /><br />If you are new to the band, the best way people have found for describing them is as a mixture between elements of Vol. 3 era Slipknot and Pantera, which does a fair job of describing the band's everyman metal approach and mixture of commercial moments with stomping heavy sections.<br /><br />It isn't progressive, it isn't extreme and it isn't electronic; American Capitalist is pretty much just pure and simple American Heavy Metal with a lot of melody, perhaps a too little cheap or cheesy for some more discerning listeners, but wholly enjoyable for the rest.<br /><br />At times the lyrics and artwork can be a bit hard to take and are the area for which non-fans will find most easy to criticize, but often they just add to the appeal of the band that has a certain infectious spirit that you will find yourself enjoying in spite of yourself.<br /><br />The band also mix in some brilliant slower moments and furious virtuosic guitar solos courtesy of Zoltan Bathory which demonstrate a level of musicianship and songwriting skill far beyond the remit of most overly commercial radio approved metal bands.<br /><br />This is their first album to feature Chris Kael replacing Matt Snell on bass and the second album to be released on the record label Prospect Park and produced by Kevin Churko (who also contributed on bass guitar, much like Bob Rock on St. Anger)<br /><br />Singer Ivan Moody's range has expanded on American Capitalist and his strong harsh and clean vocals have never sounded better. The guitar solos too from the aforementioned Zoltan Bathory are even better and impressive than before and drummer Jeremy Spencer has perhaps improved most of all, adding in lots of brilliant fills and great kick patterns. Overall you just get the impression that the band are just perfecting their formula with this album. In fact the Title Track even goes so far as to name check their previous two album titles lyrically.<br /><br />Standout tracks include heavier and faster `Menace,' the stomping album closer `100 Ways To Hate' and the groovy `Wicked Ways,' as well as the very catchy lead singles `Back For More,' and `Over And Under It.'<br /><br />If you have always hated the band then American Capitalist will not change your mind, it covers a very similar territory to their previous work, which is great news for fans, but will more than likely not win over people who exclusively listen to Black and Death Metal for example, not that it should realistically be expected to.<br /><br />Overall; American Capitalist is a very enjoyable record that any fan of the band's previous work is sure to enjoy.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|To all the nay-sayers:<br /><br />This is the ultimate box set, it comes expertly and compactly presented in a 9-disc BD format as an integrated booklet. Episodes 1-VI are there in the revised format, and yes this is a new release and not the original theatrical versions, however it still comes from Lucas. The changes are minimal.<br /><br />There are three excellent additional content BDs, with deleted scenes from all six films as well as a compilation of all the major documentaries released over the years. Hours and hours of content, and all you Starwars buffs want it I know... are you really going on to hold onto your old VHS THX versions in lieu of this sparkling new format? I don't think so!<br /><br />Embrace the new editions!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is absolutely addicting. once you start, it's nearly impossible to put down. It's challenging, but not so ridiculously hard that I want to throw my phone. aside from occasionally freezing  my phone entirely, this app is fantastic.

B0031TZ9KS|5.0|Through the narrator's emotionless and concrete way of seeing and understanding the world, somehow the reader is remarkably struck by the emotions of the various characters. Very engaging book, humorous and powerfully emotional at the same time
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This was an excellent buy! I have loved every moment listening to it! It was a sure great buy too!
B005GVA2L0|3.0|This album is an utter disappointment!!!  After five years, I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this wasnt it.  When I first heard the \\"What you Want\\" single, I was like, \\"eeh, not really feeling it\\".  But I was quite sure that the rest of the album would be phenominal to make up for the lackluster single.  My expectations were much too high.  Sadly, \\"What you Want\\" is one of the highlights of the album.  I'm a huge fan of Evanescence's past albums.  In fact, \\"Open Door\\" is one of the best album I've ever heard, all genres included!  Evanescence is one of my top 5 favorite bands of all time.  So needless to say, today is a very disappointing day for me.  I'm a teacher, and the kids have already noticed the disappointment on my face.  I certainly hope it grows on me, but I highly doubt it.  It's just not great music.  It's not even good music, it's just ok; hence the 3 star rating :(
0316056863|1.0|Tina Fey does a very funny Sarah Palin, but she should stick to her TV sketches, because she's just not a very good essayist/memoirist (or whatever she fancies herself to be in this book). I can't believe that this is what passes for humor these days: The writing in this book is predictable, unoriginal, simplistic, and not nearly as clever as the author (and apparently many readers) seem to think it is. If anything, the tone often borders on desperate -- you can feel Fey straining for a laugh. When she gets preachy -- which she often does -- the writing is banal and facile at best, sanctimonious at worst. Save your money and don't buy this book. Or if you're still curious, just take it out of the library. I'm glad I did.
B004WR125O|5.0|I am usually not one to read manuals but the English section for this is only two pages so it was worth a gander. The manual clearly states that if your device is close to or around other wireless devices (laptop, roku, PS3, XBOX, Wii, ect.) that you may not get a good signal. There is a very easy solution to this and that is to change the channel on which your wifi is operating. This can be done in your router setup (you might even have to read another manual for that if you are unfamiliar with networking equiptment) and it's pretty easy to do on a computer. Try a few different channels to see which give the best signal in your environment, happy listening to all! And before you go giving such an awesome product a 1-star review make sure you know what you are doing first don't just assume its the product and not you ;)
B003L77G6A|1.0|The fouth season of the Big Bang Theory video quality is not good at all. I am very disappointed in it. I have ordered the first 3 sessions and they were great. I preordered the one last year and the DVD was great. For some reason this season didn't have the same quality. The picture is blurry and you cant see the great reactions on the characters faces.
0380729407|3.0|Been trying to find a copy of this book for a while (while not paying list price of course). How can you go wrong at $0.00 + shipping and handling. Only issue was that someone had highlighted the book in pink. The rating on the book was 4 stars. though the cover looked good, someone should have flipped through it. Only better solution would have been if I had visited the store myself. Since options for used books in my area are limited, this was the best choice.
0394806220|4.0|Great book....Lots of fun making all the sounds and looking at all the pictures with my 2 year old granddaughter! Dr. Suess is the best!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|For those of you that have played Plants vs. Zombies and want an on the go experience, I would suggest a laptop. While this is a very entertaining version for the Android, it lacks much of the replay value the PC and other versions had by trimming down the achievements and removing most of the bonus game modes.<br /><br />This is a great game, however and if you have never played Plants vs. Zombies you will enjoy the experience. It is still worth about 3 to 8 hours of mobile play, which can go a long way.

B005DZMQ5Y|5.0|This album is not only for the Dream Theater enthusiast, its for everyone who enjoys rock music. The adding of Mike Mangini keeps the drums on point like you would expect from Dream Theater, but with new Mike's flair and knowledge of rhythms and flow.  A big thumbs up for \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" and I must say its the best so far post Six Degrees!
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|This is a very topical thriller based around the current economic depression and its beginnings. The plot throws a different twist on Artificial Intelligence getting out of hand and plays on the human fear of computers taking over, as well as the AI using THE FEAR INDEX to determine where to invest. The book revolves around the main character Dr Alex Hoffman, a physicist who sets up a hedge fund which, using his self-learning programme, earns him a vast fortune. Strange things start to happen and Alex realises he is not as fully in control of his life as he thought and begins to doubt himself and events. The writing is good, the descriptions and dialogue spot on.   Where the book let me down was in the somewhat stereotypical characters and lack of their development, the hedge fund investors are all self-involved geeks and the policeman predictable. The Darwin analogy, although interesting, seemed to fizzle out and not reach its full potential, much like the novel.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good book and I enjoyed reading it, but it could have been so much more!
0385344325|4.0|This is early Reacher, so slightly different, an epsilon less gruff a iota more social, still clearly Reacher.  Author Child has defined a credible early Reacher.  The plot is basically sound, but the details are too much of a stretch with too many bodies too casually addressed for the time period, might have worked 50 years earlier.  I took half a star off for the plot incredulity and half a star off for the inappropriately detailed or maybe just too long (for a Reacher book) sex.  The train is over the top.  As thriller genre protagonists go, Reacher is sharp, never moronic, never really off-duty.  Readers know what Reacher knows, when Reacher knows it though unless you're career military, some of the \\"clues\\" may not be meaningful; not Lee Child's problem.    Reacher books are becoming formulaic, less intriguing, less original.  If I never read another, I wouldn't wonder if I missed something.
0316098329|3.0|While I enjoyed ROOM's creative narrative from the perspective of Jack, a 5-year old boy, I didn't LOVE the book. I read most of it in one sitting, given I was on an airplane. However, the excitement of the plot began for me at the middle - when Jack attempts to escape the ROOM.  The downfall of this book is its storyline. I am currently reading Jaycee Dugard's memoir, and in comparison to REAL accounts of adolescent kidnapping and then bearing a child, ROOM fails to emerge is a winner in the race of originality. Other reviews described the book as riveting, terrifying, and powerful but I didn't find it so.   With that said, Jack saved the book for me. I appreciated the way the author translated every dark, depressing, and unforgiving moment into one of innocence through Jack's eyes. This element was refreshing. I can definitely say I was a fan of Jack's although not necessarily a fan of the entire book in general.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|First off I would like to say im a huge Evanescence fan and its been five long years since their last album and when I found out their were back in the studio again I couldn't wait for their next album to drop. I can say for those of you who listen to Evanescence you will not be disappointed with this one at all Amy lees beautiful voice is there and still in tack the errie gothic sounds are there with enough momentum to get anybody who love Alternative Rock or Rock in general will be rocking and rolling all fall long to this album. Long story short Evanescence where have you been we missed you and don't stay away for too long next time, love you.

B005D0TETA|3.0|Bill Gibron, DVD Verdict --Yes are such a product of their time that, unless you are dealing with the MTV friendly format from the '80s, there's really nothing contemporary about them. Unlike today's talentless pop idols, they are true musicians (just watch Howe amaze the crowd during his combination classical/rock revival solo). But the problems come after the fact. When you are in your '60s and struggling to breath, wowing a crowd is the last thing on your mind. Similarly, there is an inherent bloat to what prog was promising that continues to stand in the way of pure entertainment. Newer material like \\"Don't Go\\" and \\"In the Presence of\\" have a sheer sonic value, but unless you are a true fan, they will feel like filler. Similarly, the addition of \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" (sans its sole creator, Trevor Rabin) appears like nothing more than a calculated commercial appeasement. There's never anything wrong with realizing your artistic ambitions. Yes can be praised for finally getting Magnification to market. However, the concert collected here is just too laid back to legitimize the brazen ballyhoo.<br /><br />As for the technical aspects of the release, Eagle Rock outdoes itself again. Granted, the 1.78:1/1080i/MPEG-4 AVC encode has a few issues, but they are easily overlooked. Aside from the occasional background noise, the concert (shot in high definition) is loaded with color and crystal clear details. As for the sound situation, things are even better. This disc boasts a brilliant DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix that combines all elements of the show--orchestra, rock band, and voice--with deliberate ease. We feel the size of the venue and the audience ambience in the aural aspects of this release. Granted, you could jump back to the original 5.1 or the rather good PCM Stereo, but stick with the high end offering. It's worth it. Finally, the Blu-ray contains a \\"documentary\\" which is actually a behind the scenes look at the creation of the show and the influence of Magnification on the older material. Along with a music video for \\"Don't Go\\" it's a decent if non-definitive collection of bonuses.<br /><br />-Full review at dvdverdict.comion on the older material. Along with a music video for \\"Don't Go\\" it's a decent if non-definitive collection of bonuses.  -Full review at dvdverdict.com
0440244412|5.0|I can truly say, hands down, my favorite fictional series. A thrilling ride. I've raved and geeked over them like crazy for the past few years and all I can say is - there's so much depth. The contrast between good and evil, love/hate/indifference, fear and hope, the quality of life, the shallows of life vs. the depths, reality vs. fiction, maybe most importantly change...it's insane. And the characters? Like no other. Watching the transformation in a character? That's what I loved most of this book. Extraordinary.
0307887898|5.0|The Lean Startup by Eric Ries is a great book for learning how to start a company and keeping that company. It outlines all the ways for a business to continually test their product innovations and determine the corret direction to go in. Many of these environments to set up to allow for A/B testing and split testing are easy to set up and provide invaluable feedback to the changes that you make. I highly recommend this book for anyone who feels there business is plateau'ing.
0307987698|5.0|This book is adorable.  For folks like me who grew up with \\"The Monster at the End of This Book\\", it is a fun companion book to read to my own child.  I would recommend it to anyone with kids, or any adult who'd like to take a walk down memory lane with a twist.  Very cute!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I don't think the first person always work and the sex scenes don't really fit his personality and go on a bit too long, but the story is quite engaging.  This makes for a fun read.  Not one of the best Reacher novels but not one of the worse by a long shot.  Recommended.

0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange has twenty one chapters, yet the version released in the United States has only twenty.  Stanley Kubrick's movie was based on those twenty chapters.<br /><br />The reality is that the book is a philosophical novel and is, as some others have noted, rather funny in places.  Anthony Burgess created a second language with Nad-Sat, still spoken today among his fans.<br /><br />Watched the movie, then purchased and read the book and much prefer it over the stylized violence on screen.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I love the effects of this app. The pictures look spectacular and they are easily adjustable. The only bummer is that it seems to be limited to 1024x768 resolution and doesn't have the ability to use the front facing camera. These are super minor for me though. I would rate 4.5 stars if I could.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I'm a big RPG player; for every system I own, RPGs make up the bulk of them, so when I saw Symphony of Eternity, a mobile RPG, with good ratings I had to jump on it. I've gotta say, its a great start, and I hope to see more in the future. At first I hated the controls, since dragging you finger accross the screen covers up parts as well, but you can also have on-screen controls that work similar to a gamepad (they're not perfect, but pretty good for a mobile-touchscreen interface).<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Good graphics<br />+ Turn-based battles (like the original Final Fantasies)<br />+ Entertaining<br />+ Click-screen or on-screen controls<br />+ Nice artwork style<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Somewhat laggy on my HTC Incredible 2 (like framerates are too low, could need a dual-core processor to improve)<br />- Poor dialog (to be expected of course).<br />- Looks a little basic (don't get me wrong, for the price, its amazing, but still lacks even to the original Final Fantasies).<br />- Can crash if not exited properly prior to doing other tasks on your phone (it only happened to me once, but just letting you know, it is a possibility).<br /><br />All-in-all, totally worth the price, and if you give it several minutes, it gets far more interesting.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I really was not sure at first, but every time I picked it up I could not put it down.  Felt confused, about Rachel, but the whole story was very well done. I figure if I need tissue, its a good read. Life is full of surprizes, and this was.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Silent Hill is a video game series that I have long enjoyed - everything from the horrifying original, to the less-than-shining Homecoming title.<br /><br />From this, I will tell you right now: don't watch the film expecting a true movie adaptation to the games.<br /><br />There are quite a few inconsistencies from the history and back story this film offers compared to the tale that is weaved mostly through Silent Hill 1-3 - ones that are really quite frustrating to see.<br />While all of this is fairly disappointing, though, this doesn't necessarily make the film bad. The lighting is dramatic, the depiction of Silent Hill itself is impressive, and it has one of the most satisfying character deaths. On top of that, the monsters are really very well done!<br /><br />All in all? I enjoyed this movie. Certainly not the most impressive thing I've watched, but I don't regret setting aside time to fully appreciate it. If you happen to be a fan of the games, however... you certainly have to and try to appreciate it outside of the canon \\"Silent Hill\\" universe Konami created (which isn't always the easiest feat).
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I read all the reviews before buying and, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I frankly watched as a fan of the series and enjoyed it again. As I enjoyed them when they first came out. The only thing I remembered to look for was the glint in the Ewoks eyes and saw it in Leia's eyes also. The picture is much better, as expected, and for me, the changes werent enough to diminish the three films I got, IV, V, VI. I just did not like I, II, III well enough to spend the money for blu-ray.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|I came upon this album after being very disappointed with the new 2011 Evanescence CD!  The very thing I hate about that CD is the opposite reason why I love this one.  Great songs, great production, beautifully crafted songs, perfection!  Yea Fallen was something like that (the perfection of the song selection and production work).  But the style of Within Temptation is mellower, prettier, the lead vocalist really has a nice voice.  I heard some of the other CD's as well, but this newest release is by far the best (they hit their peak).  I've been longing for a new album like this for years something with the Metal/Goth style but with a band that can really write songs.  Evanescence and Amy Lee can't write good songs to save their life.  Yet here you go The Unforgiving is a masterpiece of great songs one after the other!  It goes to show you all great bands arent commercially successful and you have to look a little harder to find it!  I am a fan now to stay! I hope they become more popular, they are an awesome group!
B0009P66TK|5.0|I like big pilot and diver style chronometers and these are awesome for the money. I normally like moderately priced automatic watches like Hamilton and Montblanc but these although being cheap still definitely style up your causal outfit. They are positively attention grabbers. For sure I will wear them going hiking or sailing. Really nice dial and hands, no effort needed to see the time as in some other watches. But consider this - for the same reason that in my opinion a large man looks ridiculous driving a tiny car if you are small man I think you should think twice before buying this watch - it's huge. Having said that I bought one and gave it as a gift to my son, now feel that I liked them enough to still buy another one for keeps. Hope this review helps you with your decision, please don't forget to like it if you found it helpful.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|The book captivated me early on but then after a while it began to lose its shine. Abby meets Travis and of course he ends up wooing her. It started losing me with all the drama that was going on around them, from fight clubs to Vegas hit men...huh??<br /><br />There was a love triangle that didn't feel like it had any substance. The other guy had absolutely no chance I did not understand why he was even introduced. Her dark past really wasn't a dark past at all or at least to me it did not feel like such a powerful reason for all that \\"running away\\" talk.<br />I will buy another book by this author because I liked the writing style it was just this book that did not convince me.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|I was glad to see this movie come out on blu-ray.  It looks very good and the digi-book of it has a lot of good information.  I'm glad I bought it.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I knew that as soon as the DVD showed up, I'd probably be wearing it out - and I am.  The film just fascinates me.  I'm not going to pretend that I fully understand it yet, but every time I see it I get a little more out of it than before.  It's visually exciting too.  It's not for everybody - but I just love it.
0385534639|5.0|So much hyperbole and expectation has been spilled over Erin Morgenstern's debut novel that it's difficult to come up with anything fresh to say. Yes, the hype is justified: Ms Morgenstern is a gorgeous writer, with an uncanny ability to evoke a fantastical ambiance that is nevertheless rooted in reality; and her premise is quite intriguing: two young magicians initially unaware of each other's existence are pitted in a challenge where only one can survive, their arena a phantasmagorical circus which appears only at night and expands its labyrinthine enchantments as the magicians further their game. Set at the turn of the nineteenth-century, when reason and superstition merge into a unique amalgam, Morgenstern fills her remarkable novel with a strong and fascinating cast of characters, including the mysterious man in the gray suit and his arrogant, over-reaching rival; an enigmatic contortionist who is more than she appears; a frenetic, enterprising businessman who sets the circus in motion; his various unconventional associates; and the circus performers themselves, including flame-haired twins born on opening night. But the leads of the tale - Celia and Marco- dominate the plotline, as does the circus itself, with its monochromatic theme and visionary splendors.<br /><br />Morgenstern enchants with her own alchemical magic; she manages to turn prose into visual architecture that brings her circus to life, so that we can actually smell the caramel and see the awesome spectacle unwinding in the air on ribbons above us, as if we were there ourselves, caught up in the overwhelming illusion of it all. She is equally deft with her characterizations, and her twins emerge as surprisingly strong contenders, as does the rural boy who befriends them. However, her leads, in particular the illusionist Celia, prove less accessible. As if their fate to be rivals in a lethal game of magic has stunted their growth, they remain distant figures, who tantalize us but rarely reveal. This may have been Ms Morgenstern's intent--these are two people who have never made an independent choice even when they think they have, bound since childhood to act as puppets of their masters' ruthless intentions. But what the protagonists lack in warmth-and-fuzziness, they compensate for in their intelligence and astounding artistry; and through their elusiveness, we are compelled to ask ourselves throughout the novel: Are they truly driven by passion for each other or by their desire to win the contest, against all odds?<br /><br />It's easy to see why movie rights were snapped up. In a marketplace replete with predictable supernatural creatures, clich&eacute;d wizardry and teenage angst, THE NIGHT CIRCUS is a rarity: a fairytale for adults, uncompromising in its unique vision, superb in its eccentricity, reminding us of the sheer power of story to mesmerize and delight. - C.W.

B000XJ5TOK|5.0|The first in the series, a true fantastic origin filled with excellent ideas that have been imitated but not duplicated since.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|It's amazing.  Don't listen to any reviews that have less than 4 stars.  There are some who listen to new music and have instant disappointment because it doesn't sound exactly like the last CD and it takes them several listens before they love it just as much as the others...I should know because I'm usually one of those people.  Not this time.  I'm almost through the first listen and I truly don't understand what anyone could be disappointed with.  Buy it.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|A big fan of the series, I found this sequel to be very refreshing and full of personality. The storyline of course was understood early on, however, I enjoyed the challenging primal adventure the movie offered.
B00006HYQ5|5.0|I first got a IBM mini travel mouse in about 2004 when I bought my first notebook - IBM ThinkPad. It came with the notebook. However, it broke after about one year at which time I contacted IBM and received a free replacement. I had been using that replacement travel mouse ever since for more than 6 years and it worked perfectly on my current notebook- Macbook. However, the scroll button finally wore out last Saturday (3 days ago). I tried to repair it but to no avail.<br /><br />Luckily I had another new IBM mouse in my house as a backup (for precisely such a situation). However, it is a standard size mouse and it is not nearly as good as the mini-sized mouse. The standard size mouse's biggest weakness was that pointing was not precise and moving the cursor was sluggish. The mini-size mouse was able to move to exactly where I want it to be.<br /><br />I immediately came to Amazon to see if I could buy another IBM mini travel mouse and luckily found it. The package arrived today and I am already using it. The same speed and precision has come back after 2 days of frustration. I am happy with this mouse and I unreservedly recommend it to anyone.
B004HD61KE|1.0|The book is titled \\"The Devil Colony,\\" which was supposedly the 14th colony that never was. According to the book jacket the founding of the United States was based on a \\"fundamental lie.\\" And that to \\"uncover the truth,\\" the protagonists must \\"penetrate the shadowy heart of a dark cabal, one that has been manipulating American history since the founding of the thirteen colonies.\\"<br /><br />So after 480 pages what did the book deliver? A whole lot of gun fights and car chases and explosions and other standard issue thriller cliches that got boring very quickly. However it delivered absolutely nothing on its original premise.<br /><br />What was the \\"fundamental lie\\" that the founding of the United States was based on?<br />What is this \\"dark cabal\\" that \\"has been manipulating American history since the founding of the thirteen colonies\\"?<br />Why did this \\"dark cabal\\" want to stop the \\"Devil Colony\\" from joining the other 13 colonies?<br /><br />You will not find ANY answers to those questions that are supposedly the whole premise of the book. The closest you'll get is an one-sentence mumbling about the \\"Knight Templar.\\" REALLY?? It's been almost 10 years since Da Vinci Code and the author is STILL trying to be another Dan Brown wannabe? Well if you're trying to be a Dan Brown wannabe, at least try to have a well thought-out plot instead of simply churning out 500 pages of braindead actions that have nothing to do with the premise of your so-called \\"story\\".

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is a good book that really makes a lot of sense.  I have tried some of the advice and it really has worked.  The suggestions are really simple and worth a shot.  I quickly figured out both mine and my husbands language and the suggestions really worked!
B005GVA2L0|3.0|Two of my favorite rock bands this year decided (unfortunately) to wipe away their unique sounds and go with the mainstream radio-friendly music: Within Temptation and Evanescence. I had a lot of hope for Evanescence, I heard clips of their music that they tweeted, and the way Amy made her statement that she would never make the same album twice and that she would always reach for new heights. Sorry Amy, this time you were reaching in the other direction.  Evanescence's third album, called by their band name (and I'll use capitalization to indicate the album rather than the band), came out as a pile of music that is essentially indistinguishable from other mainstream rock and rock/pop music, such Kelly Clarkson's second album, MY DECEMBER, no wonder she wanted to cooperate on a track with Amy, I was already pretty alarmed when I heard this. EVANESCENCE has none of the dark, soul-bearing poetry of FALLEN and ORIGIN, neither the sweeping and dreamy depth of THE OPEN DOOR. The album is one-dimensional and over-layered with quite a lot of bang, and very little substance, with some occasional nice turns in the bridges that still have some reminiscence of their past selves (how little there are!). The best track that still sounded somewhat like Evanescence is Lost in Paradise, but even with that one it's hard to imagine that the song came from Amy Lee, it certainly is nowhere near the bar of other ballads that came out of this wonderful band, such as My Immortal, Hello, Lithium, Together again, The Last Song I'm Wasting On You, and Good Enough. In fact, so far the band in this genre who came out with the best album recently that I have heard is We Are the Fallen, the only band of the three that actually stuck true to the genre, and the band that is, ironically, the composite of Evanescence's \\"losers\\"  Some of the songs are not even as interesting and multi-layered as some pop artists. For example, the song Change is similar to many songs sung by the Japanese pop queen Ayumi Hamasaki, though Hamasaki does not have a powerful voice like that of Amy Lee, her songs such as Duty, Song for XX, Part of Me, M, and Surreal are far superior melodies, even her lyrics are far more artistic than that of EVANESCENCE--they happen to be exponentially repetitive this time around (I've lost count how many times she used the word \\"pain\\"), and uses way too many words that are more typical of a mainstream pop album (such as \\"baby\\") . In fact, after hearing EVANESCENCE and the OPEN DOOR, and We Are The Fallen's TEAR THE WORLD DOWN, I am currently convinced that Ben Moody is clearly the superior lyricist, and probably wrote majority of the poetry on FALLEN and ORIGIN that are clearly a level above THE OPEN DOOR and especially EVANESCENCE (and TEAR THE WORLD DOWN has a lot of his traces).  Past Evanescence album songs also accommodated Amy Lee's angelic tone and timbre, whereas EVANESCENCE's tracks sounded like they could be sung by anybody with a big voice, and do not do any justice in showing off Amy's range. What's worse, EVANESCENCE ends with Swimming Home, the pop-ist ballad that Evanescence EVER composed, not exactly the best way to end a supposedly hard rock album.   Now, I don't have issues with mainstream albums per se. After all, music is primarily to entertain, and EVANESCENCE is certainly very catchy and it still tops out about every other mainstream rock album I have heard so far. I have no doubt that it will sell very well, and I don't mind rocking my head to it repeatedly either. But overall this is still a disappointment for a band that has proven themselves to dominate in originality and creativity in the past. Instead, in comparison EVANESCENCE is an album that sounds trivial, lazy, and rushed. With that being said, I'll stick to Mozart.   P.S. After listening to the deluxe edition I would have to say that The Secret Door is the only song on the album that sounds like true Evanescence, so at least they have one song that soared.
B005GVW05Q|4.0|When Ryan Adams burst onto the scene, I thought we hadn't seen a comparable talent since Gram Parsons. I became a devoted Whiskeytown fan and couldn't tell you how many copies of Strangers Almanac I went through. Then Whiskeytown burst into flames and it seemed Ryan was headed for self destruction just like the \\"Grievous Angel\\". He seemed intent on building as big a catalog as possible before someone told him he couldn't. I found merit in a lot of it. Honestly, some of it made me go \\"oh boy\\". I own \\"Ashes & Fire\\" because National Public Radio picks albums to stream before their release. I put it on and was going to use it as background music while I did something else. Before long, I was  sitting down and paying attention. Ryan seems relaxed and happy. The lyrics are heartfelt and strong. The album has a easy, freewheeling vibe that wouldn't have been out of place during heyday of 1970's southern California country rock. Easy loping acoustic guitars with piano, pedal steel and organ flourishes. Nice! It makes me happy. That's all I ask. I have to agree. This may be one of the most \\"beautiful\\" albums he's ever made.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I typically don't write spur-of-the-moment, emotionally charged reviews anymore, but I'm feeling quite passionate about the quality of, well, everything on this album right now.  This must be the catchiest heavy metal album of the past 20 years. Every song has gotten stuck in my head over the past few days. If not for the politics of radio, \\"The Devil You Know,\\" \\"Fight 'Em 'til You Can't,\\" \\"I'm Alive,\\" and \\"In The End\\" could all be successful singles... but of course, you must be forced to listen to bad catchy songs and get them stuck in your head instead of these melodic gems. It took me eight listens to realize that this is, to me, a masterpiece. It has now made the question of my favorite Anthrax album irrelevant (choosing between Spreading the Disease and Among the Living has always caused me great difficulty), because this is number one now. I have to wait and see if this has serious staying power, but as of right now... Man. Everything just works perfectly. Joey Belladonna fits almost unbelievably well with the sound they've developed without him and I'd never guess he was 50 years old; also, I freakin' love his vocal harmonies!  On Worship Music, Anthrax reminds us that when it comes to \\"the Big Four,\\" they're still with us; the other three came out with great, I want to say \\"comeback,\\" albums in the past few years (Slayer's Christ Illusion, Megadeth's Endgame, and Metallica's Death Magnetic), but this one's king.   Oh, and kudos to them for covering \\"New Noise\\" by Refused (one of my favorite bands). It was odd hearing it sung by Joey at first, but the clean vocal melodies that replace the screaming are nearly as memorable as the rest of the album's melodies. The guitar effects and nearly disorienting stereo panning that replace's the synth parts are neat too. This album is, in a word: brilliant.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great Product, Love this movie since my kids were little always watched it with them. Now i purchased for my nephew who is also a big fan.
0780626494|3.0|Buyer beware! If you are looking for a widescreen edition, Amazon apparently does not have it. I purchased this DVD specifically because it listed widescreen format. Upon delivery I noticed it was fullscreen and promptly contacted Amazon. They allowed me to return it, but said they did not have control over what this seller was listing.
B005FFW46S|3.0|Lively and funny, and best of all, a Sam Vimes book! Terry Pratchett hasn't lost his touch. My low star review isn't for Sir Pratchett's work, but for the Kindle edition.  Unfortunately, the Kindle version (I'm on the newest version of Kindle but one, using the default font) appears to have been produced at speed and without proofing on the electronic format; as a result, a third of the way through the book I'm still struggling to get engaged with the story, since the formatting problems continue to jog me out of reading enjoyment. Almost every page has merged words; the beginnings of each subsection has a larger capital letter, which breaks up the first word into two separate lines.   If you're the kind of person who can ignore that and enjoy anyway, go for it. If not, get the paper version instead. Hopefully, the publisher is less challenged with that format.  UPDATE 10/14: By some reports, it appears that a less error-riddled version of the Kindle edition has been released. I haven't been able to get it onto my Kindle yet, so I don't know the extent of the improvement, but it sounds as though the worst of the problems are addressed.  UPDATE 10/19: I received an email from Amazon informing me that a corrected version of the book had been issued, and would be uploaded onto my Kindle. I am in the process of rereading it, but thus far it looks like the egregious errors in the first version have been resolved. While I haven't made it all the way through to verify it's a consistent change, I applaud the customer service of notification and automatic download.

B005JLNALG|3.0|Road Salt Two is a logical continuation of its predecessor. In many ways, the album reuses some key motifs and thematic ideas to organically tie itself into [[ASIN:B003INJETO Road Salt One]]. Also, it retains the 70s vibe thoroughly and it is predominantly a solo album by Daniel Gildenlow, who wrote and arranged the whole disc while also singing and playing lots of instruments. Input from the other members is minimal from a compositional viewpoint, but some tracks have certain moments that allow them to shine.<br /><br />Where Road Salt Two sets itself apart from the previous disc is in its use of a broader sound palette. This album is darker and richer in texture, and the writing seems more progressive. This is not to say Pain of Salvation has gone back to their glorious days circa [[ASIN:B0033I5MQI Remedy Lane]]; it is just that some of the songs involve elements that their older fan base might have missed on the past couple of releases. The extended instrumental section of \\"Eleven\\" is filled with focused grooves and fusion-laden guitar work that recalls the slower passages on a Liquid Tension Experiment song while the short yet beautifully crafted \\"To the Shoreline\\" wouldn't seem out of place on any of the band's more progressive-tinged discs, complete with Gildenlow's heart-wrenching, stop-start singing over a melting keyboard theme before the song develops into a mammoth soundscape with a powerful melodic facade.<br /><br />Equally riveting is \\"The Deeper Cut,\\" arguably the band's most progressive metal-sounding number on this disc. The singing style evokes Gildenlow during his [[ASIN:B00002EPRL One Hour by the Concrete Lake]] period, but the rhythmic development is more direct and keys are used sparingly. It is one of the standout tunes on first listen, and the way the percussive instruments (strung across synths and bass) lay down the foundation for the ecstatic, never-ending \\"Into the wild\\" vocal 'dialogue' is stunning, if not slightly overdone. Daniel Gildenlow's vocals are at their expressive best. I can almost see the smile on his face recording them. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't be awestruck by his desperate singing in the beginning of \\"Through the Distance,\\" which nicely segues into a longer and heavier piece. Although Gildenlow has stated that none of the songs here are autobiographical, I believe that the short ballad \\"1979\\" might be a personal song about him given the lyrics \\"Two children of six\\" (and Daniel was indeed six years old in 1979).<br /><br />It is not too hard to decipher the roots of this album as well as some of the other compositional ideas put together. The opening riff of \\"Eleven\\" sounds like something Ritchie Blackmore would have played if he were the guitarist in Black Sabbath. It is simple but very heavy. There are also shared themes and melodies on the album: \\"Softly She Cries\\" reworks the main melody of the \\"Road Salt Theme\\" to achieve unity, but I can't say I'm fond of Johan Hallgren's vocal part on this one or the song itself. Actually the main riff of this track is repeated at the very end of another song, \\"Conditioned.\\" If you think you are already familiar with \\"Mortar Grind\\" from the [[ASIN:B002RB597O Linoleum]] EP, you might be surprised when you notice it has been treated to a remix, where Johan Hallgren's guitars seem to have been re-recorded (by Daniel this time). The guitar sound is not as gritty and the choruses feature more singing from Hallgren.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are several points where the band falls short, in my opinion. The main riff of \\"Conditioned\\" is truly awful. It sounds like something Lenny Kravitz would write if he had the talent. Except for the deep final line \\"I'll be holding you,\\" it is one of the least interesting songs musically (the vocals are awesome, oddly recalling [[ASIN:B000002GK1 Badmotorfinger]]-era Chris Cornell at times). Also, the country-like guitar part and the French lyrics (sung with a very heavy accent!) of \\"The Physics ofGridlock\\" at the end detract from its quality. It's a shame because it's a great song otherwise, with melodies that seem like they were derived from \\"Innocence.\\" The final song, aptly titled \\"End Credits,\\" revisits familiar themes to wrap everything together utilizing strings and other non-metal instruments.<br /><br />Overall, Road Salt Two is a slightly better release than its predecessor, but it does have its shortcomings. Daniel Gildenlow is one of the finest singers in the world, but I feel his voice is not enough to carry an entire song. I do long for more depth in the musical department, and I do know they are more than capable to pull it off. I wish the other members were more involved in the writing process adding their own voice to the mix. On this album, besides the vocals, the best aspect is the drumming. Margarit's playing is first class; he builds intensity when given the chance and he sounds fresh and daring because his style is never pattern-based. He recorded \\"Healing Now\\" with no click track or guide other than the finished mandolin part! It would be great if Hallgren added more guitar parts and Hermansson used his organs, Mellotron, electric and acoustic piano in a more central role. However, at this point, it is Gildenlow's call, so we shouldn't be surprised if he decides to pursue his venture into this musical domain a bit further in the future.<br /><br />The booklet features tons of pictures about Daniel's newfound musical vision with lyrics and detailed song analyses. The production (mixed, mastered and engineered by Daniel also) is excellent: it totally captures the rawness without relegating it to demo quality and the mix is sharp enough to allow for shifts in dynamics.uality.

B0052ZQMLO|4.0|It works on kindle, it shows gender and is in many ways more thorough then other dictionaries I have found. But it's expensive, compared to other cheap ones you can find. But it is worth the money, I think.  The second best german-english is the one by Victor Saase. It's simple, clear and has many words. The worst is, though, it doesn't recognize declensions, so you have to look up words manually alot. And it doesn't show gender.

0385534639|2.0|I finished reading this novel this past Sunday, and while I feel the author has potential, the story just did not live up to the pre-release hype. The review in the New York Sunday Times was a bit harsh, but not far off the mark.  As a fan of authors such as Alice Hoffman, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving, and even Steven King, I expected much more \\"magic\\" in The Night Circus. The characters were one-dimensional, and I never really connected with any of them.  I love Cirque du Soleil's many shows, and wish that this story would affect me in a similar \\"transporting\\" fashion.  It is an engaging read, but NOT a MUST-READ.  Sorry.

B001EN1R2M|5.0|Interestingly enough I bough both Motley Crue's first two albums Too Fast For Love (1981) and Shout At The Devil (1983) on the same day (they were also some of the first albums I bought with my own money). Back then I only bought Too Fast because of \\"Live Wire\\" and \\"Piece of Your Action\\" but there's so much more to it than those two songs. I preferred Shout initially but as time went by I now have to say that although they are both very strong records and I love them both to death Too Fast For Love is my favorite. The mixture of Rock, Punk, Glam and other styles along with the sheer attitude that comes with it, there's just something special about the band's first album. It's not the most Motley sounding album I'll give you that but that youthful attitude and innocence in the studio cannot be replicated. Its' raw and Motley's sound hasn't been defined just yet (that would happen with the follow up, Shout At The Devil) so this is a different Motley Crue album.<br /><br />Most fans are at least familiar with two songs from this album namely \\"Live Wire\\" and \\"Piece of Your Action\\". \\"Live Wire\\" opens the album with a bang; it's fast, aggressive, heavy and it takes no prisoners. It features a terrific breakdown which sees Tommy Lee use the cowbell! \\"Come On and Dance\\" is more a pop song lyric wise and there is nothing wrong with that. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" is rather punk-ish and works pretty well and the lyrics reflect being young, crazy and rebellious. \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" is a good track although it is slightly repetitive. Vince's voice shines here and the song rocks. \\"Take Me To The Top\\" is a highlight of Too Fast, it's very catchy and effective. Somehow this great track is never mentioned and is rather underrated if not forgotten. \\"Piece of Your Action\\" may be the best track on this album it's undeniably a great rock and roll song and has some great lyrics. The breakdown has Mick Mars doing this cool guitar work and Tommy Lee's drumming backs it all up perfectly and Vince's voice is high-pitched to perfection. \\"Starry Eyes\\" is probably the closest thing here to a ballad yet its millions of miles away from the power ballad \\"Home Sweet Home\\" as its edgier.  The way Vince sings here just gets me; it's one of those moments where he stands out. There's a lot of emotion in the way that he delivers those lines. The title track was never my favorite, I don't want to say \\"worse\\" but in fact it's my least favorite song on the album not that its bad. \\"On With The Show\\" ends it all nicely. It starts a slow-rocker that gets heavier quite effective with the lyrics once again reflecting a youthful aura and tells an interesting story (that of Frank Feranna becoming Nikki Sixx \\"Frankie died just the other night/some say it was suicide/but we know/how the story goes).<br /><br />In 1999 Motley Crue re-released their albums as part of the Crucial Crue remasters and featured extra content such as live tracks, demos, alternate versions and unreleased material. As for the bonus content for Too Fast there are five extra songs here. \\"Toast of the Town\\" is a bonus here but the truth is it should have been on the album to begin with because it's probably one of the best songs here. Mick Mars even says so in the booklet. \\"Tonight\\" is an unreleased cover of the Raspberries song, I'm pleasantly surprised this was included. A cover well done and Motley make it their own while still doing the song justice. \\"Stick To Your Guns\\" was on the original version of the album from the band's own Leathur label but somehow when Elektra remixed and re-released the album the next year in 1982 this song was omitted. Nice to see it back. There's also another version of the title track which features an alternate opening and sounds slightly different. The last bonus track is a live version of \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" recorded in St-Antonio, Texas. Given the time this was taken and the fact that they didn't have the best recording equipment it sounds good even if the song is slightly repetitive (after all Vince does sings the title for most of the song). Those Crucial Crue remasters are the editions to get if you're a fan who doesn't own the albums on CD yet, the sound is great and the extra material makes those release worthwhile its always cool for fans to hear unreleased stuff form their favorite bands.<br /><br />Too Fast For Love is a special album, it doesn't have the distinctive Motley Crue sound but its rather a mixture of different sound and it shows the band's influences proudly. Yet Nikki is already a competent songwriter and wrote some of the best Motley Crue songs with this first album.  Vince Neil's voice was always high-pitched but on the debut they're even more high-pitched due to him being quite young when Too Fast For Love was recorded. His voice would change following this release and that can be seen clearly on the follow up, Shout At The Devil. A young Tommy Lee is impressive behind the drum kit. I'm a drummer myself and I love Tommy's playing on the album, just listen to that cowbell! Mick Mars was older than his bandmates and an accomplished guitar player, his riffs and solos here are excellent.<br /><br />So there you have it. The band's self titled album is my favorite Motley Crue album for many reasons but mostly because it has so many great songs that mean a lot to me. It's a younger Crue and not quite the same band people remember them as but Too Fast For Love is an amazing album and it stood the test of time in my opinion. It's just this great rock record that shows the band's influences and is great all the way through.  It was one of my first albums and to this day it remains one of my favorites. I would highly recommend this album but not only to Crue fans. Those who enjoy 70's Glam-Rock such as KISS and Cheap Trick, or even punk stuff or metal this one has it all in one package. 5/5 stars.does sings the title for most of the song).

B0051MKMNC|4.0|\\"Limitless\\" is an entertaining thriller that keeps you interested, not because of its plot which is certainly interesting but not very convincing, but because of the strong acting from the lead Bradley Cooper. Here the \\"Hangover\\" star plays Eddie Morra, a wannabe writer who has been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish, \\"Sucker Punch\\").   On the worst day of his life, Eddie gets \\"NZT-48\\" - a new drug that enhances brain activity to its maximum level. One tablet will make you not \\"high,\\" but \\"clear.\\" Using the drug, Eddie begins to reinvent his life, but as you know, some drugs can cause side effects.  \\"Limitless\\" does not take itself too seriously. The NZT is a narrative device that is too convenient but serviceable enough. Robert De Niro appears as a business tycoon, and Anna Friel is effective as Eddie's ex-wife, but it is Bradley Cooper who carries the suspense film throughout, as a desperate protagonist you just cannot hate. It is regrettable that director Neil Burger (\\"The Illusionist\\") didn't come up with a better way for Cooper's character to use such amazing abilities. What Eddie really wants to do is not always clear, and when it is clear, it is not very interesting.  The thriller keeps a good pace. The film also has stylish visuals, and the story is unpredictable, but enjoyable as it is, \\"Limitless\\" suffers from some loose ends and major plot holes that could have been easily tied up and fixed. (How many tablets does he have? What really happened to the woman at the hotel?)   \\"Limitless\\" is a slick thriller with a few suspenseful moments, but works most effectively as a showcase for the acting talent of the star Bradley Cooper.
B001ATN3QS|1.0|This is America. You have the right to love this movie. I have the right to hate this movie. Screamingly loud music, numerous riding scenes (filler), beyond unrealistic, terrible acting, \\"Pretty Boys\\" with \\"Cool lines\\",....I could go on. Just suffice it to say: I really hate movies like this.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|I'm a big fan of George Clooney's acting, as well as a fan of Corbjn's directing, but this is a plodding and very predictable spy thriller.  It has some bright spots - the surprise twist that Clooney's character isn't simply waiting around for instructions for his next hit, but instead is building the weapon for another; the picnic/target practice scene and the level of trust between two professionals who have never met before was good, and the failed assassination attempt was unexpected.  But overall, the film is very slow, and the pace undermines the few thrills - as does the entirely predictable romance, gun in the handbag and wounded \\"hero\\".  OK - too many spoilers!  Let's just say when I rented \\"The American\\" I didn't expect an arty European snooze-fest!

B00005JNEI|2.0|How can the man who made \\"Roger and Me\\", a thought-provoking, educational, serious, sad yet entertaining piece which represented some of the best of American documentary-making turn out such a rambling, nonsensical hot mess?  I only give it two stars for its stunning opening - the awful sounds of 9/11 with no picture.  That was \\"movie magic\\" - one of those utterly gripping screen moments which grabs you by the throat.  I suppose the greatest disppointment was...well...everthing after that opening scene.  It could have been a compelling story...only the narrative hops around as if on a broken trampoline...tries too hard to do discredit the Bush administration, barely focuses on the back story (\\"Charlie Wilson's war\\"; the rise of the Taliban, the history of Al Qaeda, America's love-hate relationship with Saddam Hussein) and never once attempts to explain the mindsets of the hijackers.  Moore should be ashamed of himself...I know I am ashamed for him.
0802136834|5.0|The book was said to be in good used condition, and was not torn or missing any pages, just some very minor scuffs and bends to the cover. Perfect!  I purchased The Six Wives of Henry VIII after watching the showtime miniseries The Tudors. After watching all the drama surrounding King Henry concerning his love interests, I wanted to know more facts. The Six Wives of Henry VIII was so perfectly thorough! Each wife was described quite thoroughly in her own chapter, The thickest chapters being of Katherine or Aragon and Anne Boleyn. Prob because Katherine's reign as queen was longest and Anne started the most trouble by being the king's first divorce. The remaining four wives had shorter chapters but also had shorter reigns, but of course all their stories intermingled. This book will make the reader feel as if he had met each queen personally, and even gave the reader a moderate understanding of the children of King Henry, and how they were raised, and the state of England during King Henry's tumultuous reign. A good thick book that kept me intellectually satisfied for a couple weeks (this coming from a fast reader)! A perfect read to sate your curiosity!!

0891419063|5.0|E.B. Sledge brings the WWII exploits of a US Marine to us in all it's bloody, smelly, shocking, and heart-rending glory.  Although today largely unknown, the Palau Campaign and specifically the battle for the island of Peleliu was just as contentious as the later battles of Okinawa (in which the author also fought) and Iwo Jima.  Sledge does a fantastic job of bringing the war down to the level of the individual and really puts you in the fox hole so that you can relive the horrors of war with him.  Although Sledge often recounts how he hates war and wishes that the jewels of a nations youth shouldn't have to be used as cannon fodder, he is by no means a passifist - he was a US Marine and is proud of his pedigree.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who has ever looked down the business end of weapon, especially those who are or have been Marines, as well as those of us who are simply interested in military history.  However, this book isn't for the faint of heart as Sledge brings the all-to-real tales of war at its grittiest and most graphic as he recounts time and again the deaths and/or prevations of both U.S. Marine and Japanese soldier alike.  War is hell and Sledge reveals it, sometimes, at its most darkest.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Honestly, I was blown away by this movie. I watched it with my teenage daughter, and was quite happy that I did! It is so rare to find media or pop role models that have any care for virtue and goodness. This values-based production is one of the best movies produced in the last several years. If you do not purchase it you are doing yourself and your family a disservice!

B005J0VPNC|2.0|UPDATE:  This app has been hanging in my Update section without installing the updates.  The reason for this is the multitude of comments stating that downloading said update causes you to be unable to get into the app.  I will change the review back to 5 stars if I see the developers description of the app's update includes a fix to this problem, as well as believable customer reviews that reflect the problem has been fixed satisfactorily.  Therefore, 2 stars for the app for at least the old download working, and minus 3 for not having the latest version and hanging around my Update section of the Amazon Appstore app unnecessarily.  PRIOR REVIEW:  This is definitely one of my favs!  I took some simple one-click photos right from the app that were probably suitable for framing! (If I can send to laptop and enlarge them).  The photos are THAT GOOD!  Black and white sketches are MUCH BETTER than similar features on desktop apps that distort your face up and put black blobs in some areas. You dont even need to play with those shadow angles like on desktop apps. Im in love with that Bleach feature... its awesome!  Download and see, you will NOT regret! :)
1423140591|3.0|I have enjoyed all of Mr. Riordan's (herafter, \\"RR\\") books to date, so let me caveat my review by noting that I am, in fact, a fan.<br /><br />That being said, I was a little disappointed in RR's latest book, The Son of Neptune.  RR's powerful imagination continues in full swing, as he melds some of the disparate elements of the Roman and Grecian mythos into a whole.  His plotlines continue to advance, and I genuinely enjoy his ability to create a story.  Plot is definitely NOT the problem in this novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where RR's latest book fails is in the development of the characters.  Perhaps we're supposed to fill in the details of Percy simply because we had an entire series to get to know him, but in all honesty, Percy was a complete non-entity in the entire book.  It didn't 'feel' like Percy.  Perhaps it was the movement of the point of view between the three main characters in the book, but I found it really hard to care about any of the three.  I know from his previous works that RR can build a book and create and introduce characters we really like with relatively little air time.  However, that same characterization just doesn't seem to happen here.  As I sit here trying to think of a favorite scene in the book, I come up blank.  It just didn't make enough of an impression.<br /><br />If you're an RR fan, you'll still need the book to continue the series, but I found this book to be probably my least favorite of his works.  I have no doubt that things will improve--RR is too good a writer not to--but this one comes across as a bit flat.  Accept that this work isn't up to RR's normal excellent standards, set your expectations a little lower than normal, and enjoy the book anyway.  Sure, fast food isn't the same as a gourmet meal, but . . . it's certainly better than starving!
B0058VW36U|3.0|I didnt want to put too much effort into trying to figure out how those ropes were attaching after u cut them, and I just kind of gave up when the pattern got more complicated. I didnt want to sit there planning 10 moves ahead before I even touched the screen. Then it becomes more like chess but with lollipops.  Just a little on the boring side for me, but in all fairness, it DID work without force closing like so many other cruddy apps on the market.
030745455X|5.0|PB/Thriller: This novel is not a mediocre second book like so many trilogies. While I liked the first book, which was a who-done-it, this one, while a mystery, is more of a thriller. It does have some slow spots in the middle where you are waiting for Lisbeth to reappear. When she does appear, she is in \\"Terminator Mode\\" which is awesome; a page-turner.<br />The one thing about the slow procedural part is that I am thinking ahead to how those events and minor characters interact in the final book.<br />SPOILERS:  I wish I hadn't read the back of the book and that I went into it completely blind.<br />In this book Lisbeth is accused of a triple murder and I was beginning to think she may have done at least one of the crimes. She as the ultimate resources from her thievery from the first book, but decides to fix things herself.<br />Mikael is back and he is the only person, at first, to believe in her innocence. The mystery of Lisbeth's childhood is told to the reader, but there are several red herrings along the way. The big bad guy is named Zala and it is intriguing figuring out how he and Salander are effecting each other. She supposedly knows something, or does she?

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I went to see this movie at the theater and my first reaction was - \\"Hmmm, I'm not sure what I just watched...\\" and that's when the magic happens, the movie just stays with you and the more you think about it, the more you understand it, the more you appreciate it.<br />The movie deals with life itself giving us the micro and macro perspectives of existence, growing up, learning right and wrong, love, compassion and so on. Naturally, it's not spoon fed to the viewer and it evokes sentiments rather than expressing ideas in verbal form. It's beautifully shot, superb acting and it's amazing the ammount of meaning almost every shot contains.<br />I would definately recommend this movie to the \\"quieter audience\\", an audience that can find meaning in the non-verbal, see things in the unobivious and appreciate the beauty in all those little small moments that add up to a life time.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I've been a fan ever since I heard \\"Going Under\\" on the radio, and immediately wanted 'Fallen.' I wasn't a believer at first, and instantly became obsessed with the band at fourteen years old. I loved them, any time they came on TV I would feel extremely happy and turn the volume up. Fast-forward to 2011, and the band gives me that same feeling again. Not to say, \\"The Open Door\\" was not good--it was a great CD, and I played it just as much as 'Fallen.' \\"The Open Door\\" offered us a taste of what life was post-Moody, and with a new band. And they rocked with their new formation. Now, we move to the transition of Amy Lee's career post-marriage, where she has spent a long time working on this CD. And I have one thing to say about it:  It does not disappoint.   1AM on October 11th, I went out to Wal-Mart only to find they did not stock this CD until 8AM that morning. I wasn't giving up. After losing my parking spot at the apartment complex I live in, I was determined to rise later that day and wake up to buy this CD. Forward to 12:30PM, at my local Target, there was the Deluxe Edition for 11.99. I would have bought it on Amazon, but I didn't have a credit card at the moment, but I normally make all my purchases via Amazon. I just could not wait any longer.   I rate this album 5/5, mostly because it is something I would put on during a long day, and blast in the car on the way home to my parent's house when I visit home every other week. Hell, I am adding this to my iPod at the very moment I type this.  All tracks are amazing, and I was surprised when I got to every track and realized none of them were any I'd skip. I like how Amy brings to the table music that has so many different tones to them, and any old fan would agree this CD is not the same sound as 'Fallen,' but it brings so much more than at the time it could not. It's an evolution of what the band has become, and Amy is not the same person she was when we first met her in 'Fallen' days, but at the same time weas listeners aren't either. Do we expect her to stay the same? I personally think this CD deserves the title of 'Evanescence' because this is who they are. This is what they have been for two CD's, and as they grow I am excited to see where it brings them.  I am saddened I cannot see them when they come to Royal Oak Music Theatre, because this is the only time they are in my state, but someday I will see them.   I recommend other fans listen to all the albums if they are new to the band, because you may not think the sound is good at first if you are a newcomer, but it is everything you'd expect from Evanescence. Amy has come a long way from her choir days, and also from the EP's.

As I said I am not going to go into all the things that made this movie horrible, but I will say for just about two hours I was hoping it would end and every time I had enough, John did his thing and I was back to watching the movie.  I had thought number two was bad but his one was even worse and lets hope that they never make another one.   Timahh
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Chick flick and not a very good one at that. I watched this movie about weeks ago and I barely remember the movie or any lines in the movie and that should say something about this movie, that the movie is not very memorable. The action was OK and the  movie was predictable, but then with this type of movie it is hard not to be. The acting was OK, nothing great and nothing horrible; the story was foggy in some places but because it is a simple movie everyone should have no problems in following along, even if you miss ten minutes of the movie getting or making popcorn. I have no real complaints or praise for this movie. If you have nothing better to watch and the movie is free, watch it, but do so without any expectations.   Timahh

PROS:  It is a well written, fast paced novel that has fun characters, dazzling settings and lots of twists and turns.    For me it was an easy, fast read.  My kids agree with it being a fast read and only found a few words we were looking up in the dictionary.  Most myths and characters were explained in detail, but we did do some follow up investigating at a local museum.  How delightful!  Other reviews will give you great details on the plot - but we wanted to let you know it was an entertaining start to the series.

030726999X|5.0|Hated the first one (Dragon tattoo) liked the second (played with fire) LOVED the third!Ohhh the drama. I actually read this book during my lunch hour at work over the course of 2 months or so. During the actual trial in the book i had to bring it home because i HAD to finish it. Everything came down to the trial which was so exhilarating b/c it is a long series and the first was so dark and boring that i finally felt that it was all worth it because the end was THAT good! And the most ironic thing about this is that this isnt the type of book that i like. I like romances and books about single women, life, domestic everyday issues, more emotional books about life...this was a big change. Not sure if i'll read more books like this but i'm open. Can't wait for the movies!
0553386794|5.0|I wish I was a more skilled writer, so I could properly convey what an absorbing, involving, feast for the imagination this book truly is.  I had never heard of George R.R. Martin or this series until I decided I'd watch \\"that HBO series with Sean Bean from Lord of the Rings.\\"  What a stroke of entertainment fortune to fall into.  I thought the characters and the woven stories were so involving after having just finished the HBO series that I decided I had to read the book.  Another stroke of luck - a couple of weeks later, I happened upon a first edition of this book at a thrift store for $2.00!  The writing is so well crafted and the manner in which the characters speak, think, and carry themselves is so unlike so many of our modern stories.  It was a breathe of fresh air to read in just that respect.  The way in which GRRM separates the chapters by the different characters' stories is both riveting and seamless.  The manner in which each character story is unfolded is so well crafted that, unlike many books & movies, I found myself interested in every character's tale.  Admittedly, all of the details regarding the Houses, the Lineage, the Banners, and the many Titles and Stations were initially a bit confusing.  And I confess that I had to refer to my old dictionary more than a time or two.  But it is a rare book that finds me trying to steal 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there at work, not to mention the weekend late-nighter, just to consume a little more of this mesmerizing tale.  It is a long book - some 700+ pages long, and not a bit of it wasted as page-filler.  This was a genuinely well-crafted, intelligent, imaginative, absorbing epic fantasy that I would highly recommend.  I CANNOT wait to read book two!

0439023521|3.0|This book came highly recommended to me, so I had expectations that this would be a great book.  It wasn't.  But, it told the story it set out to as well as I could have expected.<br />And I couldn't put the book down, but I still didn't care for it.<br />In Panem, a country in North America after other countries have vanished, there are 12 districts and a Capital.  There once were 13 districts, but the citizens of that area rebelled and were destroyed by the Capital.  To keep people in line, and to force them to remember what the Capital can do, once a year there are Hunger Games, where two youths from each district - one boy and one girl - aged 12 -18 are selected to participate in a game where there can only be one person living at the end.<br />The story is both suspenseful and predictable at the same time.  But ultimately, it was absurd.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|BAD TEACHER is a mixed bag.  [Possible SPOILERS AHEAD]<br /><br />It features a talented cast, particularly the always-deft Cameron Diaz, that certainly know how to play comedy, and it contains several laugh-out-loud moments, but the film is, ultimately, defeated by its very premise.<br /><br />There is not one likable character in the entire film.<br /><br />Diaz plays Elizabeth  Halsey, a ruthless, wildly inappropriate middle school teacher who doesn't give a damn about her students or colleagues, and \\"teaches\\" by showing her class movies while she sleeps off the previous night's drunk.<br /><br />Why wasn't this woman was fired months ago?<br /><br />After her wealthy fianc&eacute; and his mother dump her, Elizabeth is out to snag another rich husband and she sets her sights on a new substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) who comes from money.  Unfortunately for her, Justin is more attracted to Elizabeth's chief rival (Lucy Punch), a triangle that leads to a \\"war\\" between the two women...neither of which we, as an audience, are rooting for.<br /><br />Certainly there are moments in this picture that one cannot help but laugh at Elizabeth's outrageous remarks, but these awkward laughs are akin to the somewhat incredulous guffaws we give Larry David and his inappropriate actions on CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM.<br /><br />Elizabeth may \\"soften\\" late in the picture, but she certainly doesn't change and nothing in the screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg really justifies her \\"winning\\" at the film's end.<br /><br />Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and Jason Segel co-star in the movie, directed by Jake Kasdan.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD, which contains both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie, include deleted scenes, outtakes and two \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes.<br /><br />From Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B005MVIF7M|4.0|This is a great album, a pleasure to listen to.  I've been following Wilco since Uncle Tupelo.  Still, it's kind of funny how every new Wilco album(since YHF, especially) is hailed by critics as the greatest thing, ever, noting the band's new strategies and insights, pointing out the way that the past iterations have also been integrated.  Each Wilco album is greeted like this, and the more recent albums, which were ballyhooed in the same way, are mildly dissed as the new one is held aloft; but really, for me, this album isn't too much different than \\"Wilco (the album)\\" at all.  Perhaps the earlier album had a little more variety in it.  Just sayin.  And, for the record, I think \\"A Ghost is Born\\" really demonstrates the band's insights and breakthroughs while also incorporating the past...
1423140591|3.0|While his story lines are getting a bit repetitive and predictable, I still like them and cannot wait for the next one. This one was a little confusing trying to keep Greek and Roman straight.<br /><br />But I did love that according to him, Amazon (the website) is run by Amazons (the people) who are slowly attempting to take over the world. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said Disney had already done that; I just showed her the spine of the bob. :)
B0053TMP24|3.0|While I do like the story and the way it develops and progresses, what irritated me as I was reading this book are all the printing mistakes. Looks like nobody proof-read the book before mass production.<br /><br />Hope the publishers correct their mistake and take the time and effort to proof read the material before producing a half-baked product. Taking 2 stars out for bad printing job.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The game has very engaging graphics and sound. There are plenty of levels to keep you busy for a few weeks. I also like the variety of tools, enemies, and levels. It is does not feel monotonous even after a few dozen levels!
0553062182|5.0|This book tells me that I am not alone and I am okay. It is written clearly with good suggestions.
B004HYGF18|5.0|This wasn't quite what I expected - but, then again, what did I expect fromt the Vaccines?   It's a solid album that's fun to listen to.   Imagine if the National were energetic and had a pop sensibility, and you have the basic sound.  Now overlay that with a subtle California-beach-crooner vibe, and you have the Vaccines.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I can definately see how this show may be compared to others of it's kind, but it does so much more to raise itself above the others. A very smart show with great character arches and wry humor throughout. The package also arrived several days before the expected delivery date and wasn't damaged in the mailing process at all.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this set recently as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend. The Sound of Music has been her favorite movie since she was a small child, so it was a great choice. She opened it and has been in love with it ever since. If your significant other loves this movie, you can not possibly go wrong with this set!
0439023521|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" was one of the best books i have ever read. It was exciting, filled with action, drama and intensity. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a book about a girl named katniss who is very brave. She, along with the kids in her district 12, from 12 to 18 are entered in \\"The Hunger Games\\". This is the 73rd annual games. Every year one boy and one girl get picked from each district and they fight to the death in the capitol. All the districts watch \\"The Hunger Games\\" on television and hope their district wins. Whichever district wins gets an extra supply of food so there is alot on the line,including lives. Now go out and read this amazing book and see what happens.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Totally blown away.  This movie was not even in the theaters near me for long enough to see.  Just got the DVD and the special effects were really great and the space scenes even at the end were just beautiful.  Watched on a 50\\" plasma.  Natalie Portman was really good.  I didn't even recognize Anthony Hopkins.  Chris, I can't say enough after having him in Star Trek for just a small time and his part was such a huge impact on Star Trek, couldn't wait to see him in Thor and he did not disappoint.  Great movie totally recommend it.  Watched twice already and just got it today.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|The album is very refined, much better than the last. Amy surprised the heck out of me by returning, more-than-less, to the old EP album style in a few of the songs all the while preserving the rock attributes they are known for mainstream in others. They tried lots of new styles, including a harp (in a bonus song), so you definitely do not hear the same song twice. I still miss the ghastly chills Ben Moody used to pack in some of the songs but Amy does try. More ballads would be nice too. Overall it's a fun album that won't wear out, personally I can't even figure out which song I like more. If you can get a hold of one with the four bonus songs you will be doing yourself a huge favor.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Much better construction and more user friendly than Scosche brand.  This one will work with more cases like ifrogz due to its design.  The port lasts longer than other brand (I wore Scosche brand down in a few months and it kept detaching in my protected console while driving).  You have the option to boost charge with this one-- some cars will need it.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|this is by far their best. i love the others, was expecting a lot from this one and got it! you MUST get the deluxe edition or you'll be missing out on 4 more great songs. this was worth the wait!
0857685570|5.0|Well I am sure darn glad I got this before they stop/delayed shipping it. The only thing I saw as odd was the fact that the actual book was not shrink wrapped. That's it. Not enough to complain.<br /><br />Anyway...this book shows the impeccable talent of Drew. I have seen most of these images in his Art of Drew Struzan book but there were many I have not seen. I really thought this was a reprint of the original Oeuvre book that is going for over $200 but it's not It shows new projects. For example the piece he did for the 2012 Summer release of Cowboys and Aliens.<br /><br />Regardless, it's all Drew Struzan and it's all wonderful!!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This book is a favorite of mine, and I'm always a little wary of movie versions. But I was pleasantly pleased with this version! A great, accurate flavor of the book. Love it!  The movie did have to be reordered because the first one never arrived. But other than that it was great--and that re-order was awesome--next day!
0062011847|5.0|Because of his health problems I have regarded every new book by Sir Terry Pratchett for the past three years as a gift.  Is this particular book as good as, say, Thud? Which is my particular favorite of all the Disc World novels. No, but none the less, it is better than many books making best seller lists.  I did enjoy Snuff and will continue to buy Sir Terry's books as long as he is able to produce them.
B0055Q5F36|3.0|I took a chance and bought this for my AT&T Galaxy S2 SGH-I777.  It fits *almost* perfectly.  The only issues are that there is a hole in the flap for the microphone jack which doesn't line up with the tiny (noise-cancellation microphone, maybe?) hole on the S2.  Also, there is another hole on the left side of the case near the top, which doesn't have a corresponding hole on the phone.  The screen protector has a hole which corresponds to the hard button on the international version, which the AT&T version doesn't have.  I can't say how big a deal this is, because I couldn't get the screen protector installed without bubbles, as other reviewers have experienced.  I would have given the case 5 stars if not for the trouble with the screen protector.
B000GCFO0S|1.0|To all those who insist on writing mundane reviews of the actual movie, which makes no sense as these are supposed to be PRODUCT reviews, here is an attempt to actually promote the sincerity of a proper, and thus hopefully helpful to consumers, product review. In this case, concerning Silent Hill on Blu ray, I caution all potential buyers to be very aware of the seller as well as what \\"version\\" of the movie they happen to be selling.<br /><br />  Case in point: The actual product information listed by amazon states it is a Tristar release. However, many of the sellers are actually carrying the Alliance Films transfer, which is a company from Canada. This transfer contains the alternate cover art (as shown in the last image under the product) and contains no extra features to speak of, not even the trailers. This unfortunate inaccurate listing of product detail may clearly disappoint many individuals, who may want this movie for any number of reasons. Regardless of whether you enjoy the movie or not, obviously if you dont, they why would you buy it, correct? However if you do, it is highly disappointing to get a Canadian transfer copy when that is not what is adverstised per seller. Various alternate merchants list that the blu ray comes with extras, and some list it without, so whether those appeal to you comes down to the source you trust. If you truly want the extras, a good recommendation is to buy the current standard DVD version, as all current merchants carrying it list it with extras including deleted scenes, additional footage and multiple production featurettes.<br /><br />  In conclusion, be wary of seller information that is not complete; if your goal is to get the true American Tri-Star Blu ray release, make sure that is what you are ordering, otherwise you may very well end up with the alternate cover art Alliance films Canadian transfer instead, which is simply disappointing on more than just principal. Oh and seriously, there are plenty of more legitimate forums to post MOVIE REVIEWS, whether positive or negative, so let's try and actually give helpful product reviews instead of cry baby \\"oh I am trying to seem intelligent and display a weak form of wit by writing a jackhole review to live out my shattered dreams of being a critic and pretending my opinion matters\\" type reviews.<br /><br />You have everything you need. Now...Fight!MOVIE REVIEWS, whether positive or negative, so let's try and actually give helpful product reviews instead of cry baby \\"oh I am trying to seem intelligent and display a weak form of wit by writing a jackhole review to live out my shattered dreams of being a critic and pretending my opinion matters\\" type reviews.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I am so disappointed with this app. I loved playing  plants vs zombies on the I phone so I was so excited to get it on my droid. It stalls and doesn't save anything I have earned. Bummer :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The only way this app could be any better is if it had an interlinear Bible included. Some might not like the fact that there are no headers for sections of Scripture, but I prefer it that way.
B000KE1P7S|5.0|This is one of the better adaptations of Jane Eyre. It is hard to do justice to a book like this in a movie. The mini-series format, eleven 30 minute episodes, gives enough time for the characters to develope and set the tone for the period.   The dialogues are true and there is no attempt to dumb those down for the modern audience. Flow of scenes is a bit choppy at times. The production value is good given the fact that it was made in the 80s.  Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton (never liked him as 007) have great chemistry and are at their best in their scenes together.   It is always hard to adapt a well liked classic. This one does a decent job.

B00000E2WH|2.0|Werner Th&auml;richen was the timpanist at the Berlin Philharmonic between 1948 and 1984, serving under both Furtwangler and Karajan. He was also a composer in his own right though as Alfred Brendel commented, the merits of his works were not always obvious. He wrote a book 'Furtwangler or Karajan' - a bit like comparing the Bismarck with the Tirpitz. Sadly, it has yet to be translated into English; his commentary in the Art of Conducting makes his allegiance clear.<br /><br />Karajan was a serial re-recorder.  The  Th&auml;richen Principle is based on the timpanist's comments on his '77 Beethoven Cycle: if the conductor had any new insights into the nine symphonies, he did not convey them to the orchestra. As such, it was a waste of time. While I disagree strongly with the application, the principle has life.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, here are a dozen recordings where the Th&auml;richen Principle is sovereign - Karajan manifestly failed to surpass the original(s): the 1983 Also Sprach Zarathustra; the 1987 Mozart K 543 & K 201; the 1983 Beethoven First and Second Symphonies; the 1984 Beethoven Four and Seventh Symphonies; the September 1983 Beethoven Ninth; the Brahms Third from 1988; the Brahms Fourth from 1988; the 1985 Pictures at an Exhibition; the 1989 Bruckner Seventh; the Vivaldi Four Seasons with A-S Mutter; the 1985 Le Mer; the Four Last Songs with Anna Tomowa Sintow. In certain instances, they are meritorious but the energy could have been invested elsewhere.<br /><br />What of this digital Sibelius? Essentially it is his third and a half recording of the works (the half being his EMI / Philharmonia versions) Was the Penguin Guide (1990) justified in lauding it as disc  as \\"reinforcing the feeling that this Berlin / Karajan partnership has never been equalled\\" in this repertoire?<br /><br />Sadly, I think not. Above all, there is something fundamentally wrong with the recording that digital remasterings elsewhere have been unable to mitigate [[ASIN:B000001GNJ Nielsen: Symphony No. 4 / Sibelius: Tapiola ~ Karajan]] and [[ASIN:B000001GO2 Smetana: The Moldau/ Liszt: Les Preludes/ Sibelius: Finlandia and Pelleas et Melisande]]. No, it is not the infamous glare of early digital recordings. Rather, the recording itself is top heavy: the cellos, double-basses and timpany of the Berlin Philharmonic are malnourished in the end-product. I do not sense any diminishment in Karajan's powers (in Sibelius, he is always ex-cathedra); the Berliners are clearly in full flight - the failure came in the control-room. Karajan sounds like he has half an orchestra at his disposal.<br /><br />Sibelius-wise, this 'Berlin/Karajan' partnership is best represented in the EMI alternative [[ASIN:B000AQACWU Sibelius: Finlandia; En Saga; Valse triste; Karelia Suite; The Swan of Tuonela]]. Generously, it comes with the En Saga and Karelia Suite in train. While it is an analogue recording, there is a fullness to the spectrum that is distinctly lacking in this digital remake - and EMI's remastering is a model of its kind.<br /><br />In short the Th&auml;richen Principle applies to this disc but for different reasons than usual, leaving us with a baker's dozen.Tapiola ~ Karajan]] and [[ASIN:B000001GO2 Smetana: The Moldau/ Liszt: Les Preludes/ Sibelius: Finlandia and Pelleas et Melisande]].

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. A staggering spiritual and cinematic masterpiece. A life-changing experience. My spirituality has deepened since seeing this film. It's the only movie I've ever seen where my overwhelming feeling leaving the theatre was pure gratitude! Do not miss this, no matter what else you ever see!
B005IS565S|5.0|American Capitalist is Five Finger Death Punch's third studio album and all i can say is wow... This album is amazing, the band just keeps getting better and better with their material. This is a MUST BUY for any Five Finger Death Punch fan. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. I love this album.
B005IS565S|5.0|The new 5FDP album American Capitalist is absolutely amazing. I love it and I can't wait to see them live again!
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|Brand new unopened dvd, great and inspiring movie. Well written and great actors, I can watch this movie over and over. Brings me to tears every time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great!!! loved it on my phone and xoom...recommend it to everyone.....great for the environment...hoping they would have more magazines soon!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|there better be a follow up movie to this one because i'm hooked, loved this movie great action , effects, has all you need to make a great movie, keep it coming!
B005IS565S|5.0|This is without a doubt an awesome album by Five Finger Death Punch.  Yes there is a couple of slow songs however, if you are a true 5FDP fan then you will know that even though they are a metal band then they appreciate some of the more refined songs.  That is a big reason as to why they chose to do acoustic versions of some of their songs.  I personally enjoy their music because they aren't afraid to show how the world is actually ran.  By this I mean corrupt politics as well as \\"War is the Answer.\\"  If you enjoyed their older albums then you will definitely appreciate this one.  They also definitely stuck to their guns with this album by keeping to their theme of the album.  If you noticed then with \\"War is the Answer\\" they made most of their songs about war.  With this one most of their songs on it is about corrupt politicians wanting to control everything as well as people who sell their soul to the devil, so to speak.  They have found very interesting ways to diversify their music but keep to their theme of the album.  To sum it all up, if you like to hear about how corrupt people make their decisions and how it is absolutely ridiculous.  Then this is the album for you.  Also, if you enjoy their earlier work then this album is very similar to their same style of music but is not the same music with different lyrics, like some bands like to do.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very addicting game.  couldnt put it down. beat all available levels with 3 stars.  got it for free but certainly worth the 99 cents! would like more from this developer!
B00417HV14|5.0|I have this on DVD, but want to have it on Blu-ray. And for me it is worth every cent! Excuse my English. I don't speak it very well.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Love the game.  I had to uninstall and reinstall because of freezing up phone, hopefully it fixes the problem permanently.
0743556003|5.0|I am listening to this for the second time.  The 1st time was about 4 years ago.  I clean house, paint porches, or do chores & just get lost in the story.  The story may be slow to build for some readers but I enjoyed it.  I feel like I know the characters. I am always amazed by the imagination of Stephen King.  One never knows where his story will take you.  Mare Winningham did an excellent job narrating.  I loved Duma Key as well.
B000V5SIFS|5.0|This is easily one of the best episodes of DS9.  It gives you a deeper insight into the Cardassian-Bajoran relationship, without which the Cardassians would just be seen as brutal killers and the Bajorans as blameless victims.  Add some pretty fine acting for a TV show and you have a great episode.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|This movie is so not worth the money. The only good bits are in the trailer. They could have done so much more with this movie but they didn't. Don't waste your time.
0345529057|5.0|I am more than happy with my order. It was an excellent price and I received it in record time!
B002LLE3Q8|5.0|Well, I was thirteen years old and bought this album for its cover. To say I was blown away was an understatement. Because I was a Moody Blues fan I definitely noticed the vocal and atmospheric influences of the Moodies Yet, there was something else here never heard before. This was an entirely different \\"animal\\" indeed. I loved the way they could be softly beautiful one minute (helped by Greg Lake's lovely voice) and the next minute fill the room with screechy and bold, and for the time, almost \\"unmusical\\" sounds.(almost noisy and unpleasant but undeniably \\"New\\" )The lyrics were always profound and intelligent. I played this album until I wore it out. I bought a new copy and now I bought the C.D. Of course I will keep all three copies. I have followed King Crimson through all their changes and they were continually innovative, provocative, beautiful and scary. One of the best groups of all times. Holds up completely to anything of this time. This is their classic, first attempt and belongs in any music collection.
B00290FWYS|5.0|Cafe del mar vol.XVI has many good songs, original because of having songs for relax and awakening songs... It´s a very good purchased.
1419702203|4.0|Loyalty dictates that I should give this beautiful book 5 starts, but there were a few flaws that dampened my overall enjoyment.  While the images are splendid, there seem to be gaps in the \\"narrative,\\" such as the mid-years of the Beatles (perhaps because Patti Boyd was on the scene?) and the final decade or so of George's life. I did love the Travelling Wilburys studio shots, though I wish there had been more, and I skipped the handful of pages dealing with George's love of racing.  My favorite aspect had to be when George got involved with the Monty Python team to help them realize Life of Brian - I was previously unaware of the impact of his film company. Part of my problem may be that I am not very familiar with George's solo catalogue, other than his top few hits, which may have been why I wasn't particularly moved by Paul Theroux's introduction.  Regardless, this stunning book is a \\"must-have\\" for Beatles/George fans, so indulge!<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book because I won a random local radio station raffle.
B00466HM28|3.0|I saw another review that described the keyboard as \\"toylike\\" and I couldn't agree more.  Its really small - its not 25 keys from a full sized keyboard.  The drum pads work okay, but really require a lot of pressure.  Due to the size,  I can't see playing anything more than a few chords or a simple melody.  If you're going to be using this for more than that, you will need something bigger.
B003FXXNH6|4.0|This is definitely one of the better martial arts movies ive seen in a long time. Nice twist at the end that was enjoyable. All in all a good buy ;)
B004X4RU9I|5.0|This Movie was just Icing on the Cake of the first movie.  This movie had a great story line and played well into the history of Bruce Li's master which not much was known about.  It was great to see the little story plots play out along the way and after seeing the first movie and I was glad to see the definite theme of the Master truly a master that always had more things in reserve to kick it up a notch.  I always dislike when kung-fu movies played out with the master getting beaten first then coming back and winning.  It is much better to just be purely the best, know and prove it, humbly as the Master did in this movie.  If want to wisely spend a few hours of your time watch both of these movies and if your a prime member you can stream them for free!!!!  Total Awesomeness!!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This Album is all good.<br />There are no \\"filler\\" songs to make it longer.<br />Amy Lee's voice is the star of this album, as it should be.<br />It's not as \\"Emo\\" as the others, which is the one thing that kind of bugged me in some of their other songs.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I bought this headset when it went on sale. I heard great things about them and the price seemed right. I have to say that I did not experience any of the cracking and popping others have written about.  The sound was great...provided I was not doing anything on line.   The wireless transmitter for the headset completely obliterates any wireless N connectivity.  Your xbox will see your network with a strong signal, but it will not connect...until you unplug the X41 transmitter. I spent some time on Turtle Beach's website and their \\"solution\\" is to downgrade to wireless G.  To me, this is completely unacceptable.   Fortunately, I have a second xbox that is wired and I will use the headset on that one.  I don't have much choice since I didn't figure out the problem was the headphones and not the xbox until it was too late to return them.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|The quintessential ensemble cast \\"dramedy\\".  Yes it has a role for Hugh Grant, but if you are not a fan, don't worry, he is evenly balanced by Emma Thompson, Allan Rickman, Liam Neeson, et al. No one character steels the show.  Or monopolizes it.  My husband and I enjoy it each Holiday season because it is set at holiday time, but also because it makes us stop and think about our own personal relationships and how perhaps we could be making more time for them.  It has plenty of fun and fluff to make it a great popcorn movie while at the same time, having plenty of meat to get a hold of each time we re-watch it.  We've watched it with a number of friends and family and many of them never saw it or rented it for one reason or another (Not a fan of Hugh Grant, afraid of the British accents, not a fan of the romantic comedy) But they all reported being pleasantly surprised that it was MUCH more than the stereotype they had in their head.<br /><br />TAKE A CHANCE AND BUY IT: if you are on the fence, you won't be disappointed.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I just finished Beauty and the Beast in 3D and it brought me back to my childhood. As far as the 3d conversion process I think overall they did a good job. Originally the movie was hand drawn and some Computer Animation. Some of the 3D look was represented in appearance by that different animation style and took a little away from crisp completely computer animated 3D we have become use to. There was some ghosting involved from what I could tell but most of the time it was not that distracting. Even with a good amount of the background looking reminiscent of old school Disney animation I grew up fondly enjoying, it was made to look like it was in 3d but sometimes I do not always think it worked out spotless.<br /><br />Do not let some those negatives sway you too much, they did have fantastic backgrounds that added depth to what was one 2D, and made the castle look much bigger then I remember it was. As she walked through the streets in the beginning of the movie the rooftops were given dimension making the town seem a little more real. What were once just beautiful backdrops of the castle the added dimension brought out the size and scope of west-wing, library, and the great hall making them feel bigger, and a more warming or dreary place.<br /><br />What can be said for the Ballroom but wow. it was a masterpiece then, and it was equally as stunning now. Being how the Beauty and the Beast waltz scene was fully done in computer animation int he past, it really was able to shine with the added 3d process added.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the movie in 3d and brought a new depth to an already beautiful story. If this was going to be one of the harder 3D conversions Disney was doing, I can not wait to see Aladdin, or Little Mermaid. Finding Nemo will be amazing, along with monster's inc. Looking forward to them.<br /><br />Score wise has to be a high 3  to a low 4 due to the limitations it was under because of the old animation styling, but it still came out pretty well.<br /><br />(though Little Mermaid will be along the same limitations B&B was under due to most of it was not computer animated either, but still looking forward to seeing Mermaid as well)e along the same limitations B&B was under due to most of it was not computer animated either, but still looking forward to seeing Mermaid as well)
B004SGWYVA|1.0|Trash. It is amazing how many people gave this anime a high review. It's trashy fanservice. The whole show is a setup for it. It is everything wrong with shows in Japan- more and more crap like this is coming out and because people like those who gave this a 4 or 5 stars keep giving it, well, 4 or 5 stars. If you want to watch naked boobs, big boobs, panties, there are a lot of websites out there you can jack it to. For god sakes, if you want toons with boobs and hot girls, Japan makes that too, it's called hentai. Leave porn to porn and tv shows to tv shows. Nothing against a little fanservice as long as the show doesn't go out of its way for it. This though, is ridiculous. Its entire plot is based around fanservice.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|one of the most addictive games ive played for awhile! wasnt sure if i would like it or not and downloaded it when it was free but i wouldve been happy if i had paid for it. has a decent amount of replay value if u want to unlock everything otherwise playin straight through is a pretty good time too. slightly slow on the load but not the longest ive had. otherwise works great on my evo
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book so much! I really can't believe how good it was. This book is a magical love story that has so many strings that all tie together in the end. I truly loved this descriptions of the circus and the world that the author created. This is the kind of book that is so unique it sticks with you. I get that it may not be for everyone, but I feel lucky that I am counted among the fans! I highly recommend!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Not much to say, great movie, great audio-video quality, DVD and digital copy included, great special features.  Check Blu-Ray.com for a real review. I am not affiliated with the in any way, but their reviews are very accurate and it's a lot more easy to know information about audio track and substitles language there, than on Amazon. For me this is a great deal, since I like having the French dubbed version too on the Blu-Ray I buy.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have to say I LOVE this show and I am looking forward to getting season 5 next.  I can never get enough of these goofy nerds.  Penny is such a ditz too but you have to love it.
B000O77RLE|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. But if you're here,it's because you already know that and more likely wish to know about the Blu-Ray quality itself.  Well what can I say other than WOW. The sound and the video quality is simply amazing. Even the Making-of in the Special features has been upgraded to HD over the DVD.  If you wish a more complete and accurate review of the product, visit Blu-Ray.com . I am not affiliated in any way to them but their reviews are very accurate.

B005IS565S|5.0|This is an amazing album that FFDP was able to produce. I am very glad to say that there is still no Five Finger Death Punch songs I dislike. This is a classic FFDP album and it also shows how they are able to differentiate themselves from other heavy rock bands. This deserves a TRUE 5-5 stars... Truly amazing thanks guys!

0446547654|4.0|I read this book straight through the minute I received it this morning. It was a fairly quick read. I've read all of his books and this book was not one of my favorites but still a decent book. It kind of reminded me of a combination of some of his other books- such as The Notebook with a Bend in the Road twist with Dear John thrown in... and the suspense that he included in some of his books like the Guardian and recently Safe Haven.  It made for an interesting combination. It was predictable as I figured out how it was going to end but it was a good story all the same. He wrote this story from different view points as he usually does but it seemed that this time he added some characters that I didn't see a point in including as it didn't really add much to the story and probably could have done without their point of view. All in all, typical Nicholas Sparks book- fans will read and enjoy.
B005IS565S|5.0|This latest album from FFDP is really great. It brings to the table a different sound from the band's other albums, adding variety to their menu. I highly reccomend this album to anyone, whether you're new to FFDP or have enjoyed their previous work.

B005IZLPMY|2.0|I've been amped for Marvel's tie-ins to The Avengers next year, but this one is a real stinker.  Yeah Iron Man 2 wasn't the deepest movie, but the plot here is completely superfluous.  They spend waay too much time showing what a wimp Steve Rogers is, then basically throw him into WWII with almost no exposition or real plot.  Somehow the Red Skull has gotten a hold of the Cosmic Cube, but with no idea what to do with it, and Cap has even less idea what's going on.  It's like a condensed version of what the movie should have been, but with just a beginning, and an end.  The pay-off for the epilogue is almost it's only saving grace, which is basically another trailer for Avengers, then an actual teaser trailer for Avengers.  Enough hype already, just bring on the main event.
B004ZNACA6|2.0|I own three Pink Floyd Golds CDs made by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab - which sound awfully a lot like the regular mid 1990s regular CD issues: Meddle, Dark Side, Wish YOu Were Here. And having taken my 3 CDs to a friend who has spent the money and bought this new 2011 remaster CD box set, I am not really hearing much difference. I'm sorry, but I think I may be the one here to say \\"The Emperor Has No Clothes\\". I was greatly anticipating this box set release, but to tell you the truth, I am very disappointed in the hype vs the quality delivered. Plus the packaging is kinda cheesy. Has anyone else found the same issue here? The 2003 Dark Side remaster sounds superior to the 2011 remaster. Am I going nuts here?

0545123291|4.0|Lyrical, magical, breathtaking imagery, gripping plot, and amazing characterization--the second book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls didn't deceive. Stiefvater has weaved a dazzling world for us readers to enjoy. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because I saw myself more invested in the second characters than in the leading ones in this book. But nothing bad. I'm dying to see what happens next!

0596806027|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is not a reference book, nor does it claim to be. Instead it is a book you can simply read from cover to cover that gives a concise and at times entertaining view of HTML5, and how it came to be.   Some of the anecdotes may not appeal to everybody, some of the details may be stress some areas more than others. However it is a good read (and that is something considering it is ultimately a technical book), and for me it was this style, and format that meant I constantly returned to read more. Because of the way that the book is written I read more of it and and retained far more knowledge than a pure reference book.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|If you are an avid, non-pro shooter and just need something with better fill than a built-in flash and bounce capability, the SB-400 is a HUGE value at $120.<br /><br />It will work with any Nikon that uses the i-TTL system (all newer DSLRs and some point-and-shoots). I have a D5000 and it has drastically improved my picture quality especially for indoor people shots, thanks to bounce-flash. Simply point the flash at the ceiling or a wall and everything gets soaked in natural looking light. It does wonders for skin tones and colors in general. The look is far-and-away better than the direct flash burn that we're too used to seeing in so many people shots on Facebook, Flickr, etc. I've used it in numerous environments like restauraunts and bars with higher, darker colored ceilings and still bounced sufficient light down to the subject when the flash and a little ISO is cranked up in-camera. Direct fill outdoors looks great as well. Compensation is incredibly well controlled automatically by Nikon's system.<br /><br />Of course, bigger models do all of this with more power and versatility. However, they are significantly heavier, bulkier, and more complicated. 90+% of DSLR shooters these days are just looking to have a good time shooting and get great results. Most people (including myself) have no interest in making dozens of adjustments for every situation, let alone have the technical knowledge to understand it all. Big flashes give you even more decisions to make when your camera is better at making them for you in the first place. The SB-400 is great for its LACK of controls and totally manageable size. I basically leave mine attached all the time and it never gets in the way.<br /><br />Battery life is definitely decent as well. I generally have to switch out the AAs every 5-6 sessions of heavy use. You are adequately warned as recycling starts to lag when power gets low and an LED blinks repeatedly when its done.<br /><br />If there is a \\"must-have\\" accessory for Nikon DSLR, this is it. Before you start shopping for faster lenses and fancier bodies, add bounce-flash to your set-up and you might stop there!u start shopping for faster lenses and fancier bodies, add bounce-flash to your set-up and you might stop there!
B003CN4R74|3.0|Just received my copy yesterday and gave it a full listen through twice.  I am a big Evanescence fan and while this isn't a bad release, it certainly isn't going to be in heavy rotation in my house.  I'd say it is my least favorite Evanescence album.  Amy Lee is in fine voice as expected, but the music and lyrics are a bit lackluster.  Maybe my expectations were too high after such a long wait for a new release (its been about five years right?).  Bottom line: listenable, but forgettable.
0439023513|1.0|Sometimes I even wonder why I get myself wrapped into series anymore.  Just about every series I've read for the past 6 years has ended on such a sour note.  So of course I lead myself to believe that this time it will be different with Mockingjay.  But of course, I've mislead myself once again.  It wasn't the darkness or all the deaths that bothered me.  I think they have to be addressed in this world that Collins has created.  My issue was in the delivery.  Katniss, a girl who I admired from the first chapter of the Hunger Games, seems to be absent from all the action.  I understand that she has to deal with the scars of two hunger games, but the title of this book is Mockingjay.  I would have thought she would have risen above these ordeals to lead a revolt against the Capitol.  Instead, everything is done for her behind the scenes while she mopes around with Finnick for half the book.  It was just so...annoying.    I also felt horrible for Gale, who is all but set up to be a villain for no apparent reason.  It was like Collins set up this death situation so that Katniss would have to end up with Peeta.  It's not that I particularly preferred one relationship to the other, but his character (as well as just about everyone else in the series) was butchered in order to move along an agenda.    Once again I was horribly disappointed by the last book in a series.  After hungrily reading the first two books, I had to force myself to finish Mockingjay just so I could talk to my friends about it.  I don't mind the deaths, but certain ones were done without much respect at all (take Finnick's death for example).  And despite where this could have gone with a character rising above adversity, Katniss plays the rag doll and then is heralded for her bravery, even though she literally does nothing throughout the entire book.  Everything was rushed about the book, and certain areas could have been explained much better (like the war chapters, which left me very confused).  Even though it's been over a year since it released, I still have a bitter resentment for the series because Mockingjay was unable to carry the spirit and passion that the Hunger Games and Catching Fire had.
0439813786|4.0|I really loved this book. It tells a wonderful story about a boy without a family, with hardly an identity, who finds himself alone inside the walls of a train station. It's a HUGE book physically, over 500 pages, but it's largely illustration. It reminds me in a way of the Chris Van Allsburg books. It is a children's book, a novel, a piece of Historical Fiction with real life characters. It's really remarkable. Such a special book. And the movie adaptation looks to follow the book very closely. I'll be interested to see if it does in fact. I'm quite excited about it.
0385738773|4.0|The Maze has ended, the Scorch Trials are over, but the search for the Cure still continues. The world is worse shape then ever, Cranks have taken over in most cities just waiting till they are fully past the Gone. Its up to Thomas and his friends to fight against W.I.C.K.E.D. , a government agency devoted to finding a cure for the flare at any and all costs and avoid the Cranks at the same time.<br /><br /> The Maze Runner series in phenomenal and I absolutely could not put this book down. Even though I was slightly frustrated because I thought surely answers would come in book three, and they did but much later then I expected them. Also, I'm still struggling with the believability behind W.I.C.K.E.D. studying the subjects brain patterns for a Flare cure, couldn't they use DNA testing or some more biologically based testing rather than psychological? I really struggled with that aspect of the novel, but putting that aside, the novel was not at all difficult to get into and stay involved with.<br /><br /> There really wasn't a whole lot of character development in this novel, they had all been pretty well established in the first two novels and pretty much follow the same blueprint. There were only a few characters that stood out to me as being exceptionally complex, Newt and Gally. My only complaint was that I feel more time could have been devoted to character development and relationships as opposed to the pages and pages of fight scenes that often disengaged me.<br /><br /> Too many questions went unanswered to me, and while I agree that some mystery is good, when this much tension has been building for two books there needs to be some reveal to that the reader can relinquish all their questioning. I also didn't like how major charters just stepped out of our view, Teresa for instance, she's pretty essential to Thomas's plot and Frypan too. There were some goodbyes and deaths that I felt were rushed and not explored enough especially considering the close relationships these characters had with Thomas.<br /><br /> Of course the novel left us with a little mystery behind what REALLY happens in the end, but that was one of my favorite parts. Dasher refused to wrap everything up and tie and pretty red bow on top. I like elusive open ended stories, it leaves the story to me to finish!<br /><br /> I really am being Nit Picky, the story itself is adventurous, exciting, and at times outright creepy.

0452287022|3.0|I have to say, this book has stayed with me, though I can't explain why. As it pertains to Vermeer, it is largely invention, and yet I did come away feeling like I identified with him a little. I appreciated the subtleties in the relationship between the heroine and the artist, the complexities of a girl in her position and during her time. I felt Chevalier painted the setting well, though I found Griet a bit difficult to sympathize with. Overall, I felt it a bit over-hyped. It is, in some ways, very well painted, a story well told, but it lacks complexity, and drive. I did feel, however, that it was a far greater accomplishment artistically than was Burning Bright.
1612930425|5.0|One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.<br /> Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.<br /> In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.<br /> On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.<br /> In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Some people consider any esoteric, artistic experience to be pretentious, since they consider themselves to have adequate intelligence to understand it and then find it incomprehensible.  I saw this movie at a local art house, and I recognized the polarizing effect it has on audiences as soon as I heard someone proclaim \\"One and a half stars\\" during the credits.  They clearly didn't get it...but neither did I, entirely, although I was mesmerized by the incredible images and, as a child born in the '50s, felt a kinship with its characters.  I'm a big fan of Terrence Malick's other films, particularly \\"The New World\\" and \\"Days of Heaven\\", so I knew there would be similar elements in this film, such as the quiet voice-overs expressing the inner monologues of the characters and the gorgeous cinematography.  I was completely unprepared to see DINOSAURS in a Terrence Malick film...and I was admittedly delighted!  This film is more concept than story, although there is a plot; but it unfolds like \\"Howard's End\\", slowly and without telegraphing its next moves.  When the ending arrives, one is left wondering what just happened. For me, it had a profound impact.  I applaud anyone who thinks they understand this film after the first viewing, because I knew it would require repeated viewings for me to glean its full meaning.  This film is not pretentious in the sense of trying to be something it's not, but it is pretentious in the sense that it demands more than some viewers are prepared to pay. It is enormously enigmatic, and that's what sets it apart from formulaic films that don't require much intellectual thought (mindless entertainment, in other words).  Finally this is a film I can sink my brain into and chew for a while to appreciate its flavor.  It does not reveal its secrets quickly and to everyone, so you may find you don't like it.  For those who are mentally prepared for the challenge, it's a banquet.

0553801473|3.0|I can't add anything that other reviewers haven't already said, but I can say it faster.<br /><br />Most of Martin's readers know that Feast and Dance were originally one book.  They should have stayed that way.  The first 500 pages (almost exactly) of Dance consists almost entirely of strained conversations between people who don't like each other.  After that, the book delivers the action and intrigue at a pace Martin fans will recognize and enjoy.<br /><br />There are a number of points of view in this book that are wasted pages.  The actions of these pov characters could have been summed in less than a page at some point in the story where their plans finally fail.<br /><br />Finally, there is no place for cliffhangers in a series that produces a new book every six years.

B005DI9906|5.0|This is a very straightforward adventure film about redemption and honor. A British officer resigns his commission on the eve of a war, is branded a coward by his friends and wife to be, then sets about redeeming his failure of honor. Its set in war in the Sudan in the late 1800s. But in some sense, the story is completely timeless. It could play out at any time and in any war. The story is more one of pure escapist adventure than grim reality. But its never dull and its always fun.<br /><br />The only part of the film I've never liked is the beginning. It just doesn't seem to work as well as the rest of the film. The early material needs to show both his future motivation for leaving the army and why he went back on the decision. To me, its less about patriotism, the empire, tradition and so on than it is about staying the course with a decision made and sticking to friends in a difficult situation.<br /><br />The film looks very good. There is the technicolor, the desert, the attention to period military detail and properly capturing the Sudan as a place. And with the restoration associated with the Criterion release, it looks even better.<br /><br />The film presents the war exclusively from the British point of view. The Sudanese opposition are basically ciphers. There isn't whole lot of on-the-ground moralizing about whats going on. Its an old film, but a good story.

0784011710|5.0|The late Alan J. Pakula, who both directed and wrote the screenplay for this most heart-rending of odysseys, did a formidable job of capturing life among the tenants in a pink-walled boardinghouse in 1947 Brooklyn.--Something author William Styron partially dreamt and partially lived.   At an outside glance, that topic may seem unremarkable. But through Joseph Sommer's staid, wistful narration, we are drawn into this world in which a struggling young writer from Virginia, who answers to the name of \\"Stingo\\"(Peter MacNicol) resides in this \\"Kingdom of the Jews\\", working as an editor for the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company by day, as he seeks literary inspiration of his own.    Rita Karin as Yetta Zimmerman, is the 22-year-old-writer's landlady.Other tenants include Josh Mostel's Morris Fink,Marcell Rosenblatt's Astrid Weinstein, Moishe Rosenfeld's Moishe Rosenbaum, and Robin Bartlett Lillian Grossman.   But the occupants who will change his life forever are the mercurial chemist, Nathan Landau (played to perfection by Kevin Kline, whose beautiful classical piano playing is inspiring), and his beautiful and mysterious lover, Sophie Zawistoski(the incomparable Meryl Streep with a dead-on Polish accent and a complexion which, like her character, has the fragility of Dresden porcelain).    Stingo is intrigued by the volatility of the couple's relationship, and their eccentric habit of dressing in period costumes as they dance to the music of the era for which they have dressed.   Gradually, the three become friends, and Sophie, a Polish Roman Catholic survivor of Auschwitz, reveals her past. In the meantime, Nathan arranges for something to be done about the young writer's sexual frustration by arranging for him to meet a formerly frigid psychiatric patient named Leslie Lapidus( Greta Turken).   To the beauteous strains of Harry James' \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", Stingo tries to court the nubile young creature, whose prior inhibitions  would not even allow her to say the \\"F\\" word, which she now uses repeatedly, only to have that not work out as he had hoped.    We learn that after Sophie came to America, still in poor health after her ordeal,she attends classes at a University.After dealing with a campus librarian(John Rothman) who alternates between coldness and irritation when she gives an incorrect name for author Emily Dickinson when trying to get him to locate her works in the library, she collapses, and is encountered by Nathan. Not being in any position to refuse his help, she is taken in by Nathan, who helps treat her anemia, and feeds her.   As Sophie's past unfolds, Stingo is also encountered by Nathan's brother, Larry (Stephen D. Newman), who reveals that while Nathan was a brilliant and promising young student in his formative years, but is now insane. Larry advises Stingo to monitor  his brother and report to him by phone periodically.Perhaps, however, it may have been unwise for  Larry to have advised Stingo to not offically reveal to Sophie the full truth about the insanity with she she has often dealt and which on more than one occasion has been injurious to her....   Gradually, the haunted immigrant in her 30s discloses that her father(Ivica Pajer) was a Professor for whom she did secretarial work, and she typed the anti-Semitic speech he was to make with almost complete passivity, but then with far too many errors.When he recited the speech as written, the professor, who believed in the possibility of human perfection, verbally renounced his daughter, and Sophie's husband, who was his assistant, rejected her as well. Both men died during the occupation, when the Nazis rounded up and shot Polish intellectuals.   Sophie's lover, Josef (Nadim Prohic), and his half-sister, Wanda( Katharina Thalbach) were brave resistance fighters, who would also fall to the Nazi Regime.   Sophie is arrested with her two sweet, beautiful children Jan and Eva(Adrian Kalitka and Jennifer Lawn)and sent to Auschwitz by train.   While she will later bepulled from the general prison population to work as a secretary for Commandant Rudolf Hoess(Gunter Maria Halmer) due to her ability to speak cultured German, the story of her initial encounter with him on the night of her arrival constitutes the devastating, dramatic climax of the whole saga.   Auschwitz is a surreal world where Hoess' children (Irena Hampel, Sandra Markota, Hrvolje Sostaric, and Marko Zec) frolic happily in a cobblestone-padded garden park, while on the other size of the tall fence, inmates are crowded into long stalls with barred windows, pleading for water and mercy as they wait to be gassed.We observe this startling contrast as a female SS guard(Vida Jerman) escorts Sophie across the muddy prison yard, and past the corpse of a hanged inmate, through the gate door.   Ulli Fessl plays Frau Hoess, Eugeniusz Priwieziencew plays a prisoner at the shower in Sophie's cell who tries to get her to steal the radio of Hoess' oldest daughter, Emmi(Melanie Pianka)so inmates can monitor the Allied fighters' progress. Ironically, it is Emmi who actually gives Sophie a moment of kindness and a sense of her past normalcy.    Sophie returns to the general prison population, lamenting her failures in both her attempt to secure freedom for one of her children, and her attempt to steal Emmi's radio. She will spend a total of 20 months in the camp before liberation.   The rest of the tale confirms the impossible love Stingo has for a haunted and doomed woman, unable to rise above a tragic past.    The final words of an older and wiser Stingo are halting and poetic as we see the younger man crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, where he, Sophie, and Nathan had raised a toast and smashed glasses one night, with suitcase in hand on his way back home with a pained expression on his face; the netting of the bridge itself is like a hauntingly symmetrical poem as Marvin Hamlisch's musical score dolefully weeps for the butchered, betrayed, and martyred children of the earth, and we receive one last, and extremely faint glimpse of a glistening-eyed beauty who leaves an indelible mark on the heart of the man who will write her story.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|In E L James sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey she definitely does not dissappoint! The cliffhanger in this book is not as to die for as the other which helps me control myself on waiting for her 3rd book!  I've read this book about 3x and I cannot get enough of Fifty (Christian) and his relationship with Ana. In this book, the hilarious emails continue between Ana and Christian. We also see more of Ana's smart mouth which I absolutely love! Ana and Christian's relationship develops into something more deeply than the first book.  Plus we still get more erotic romance :) We also see more character development with some old and new characters. I like that we also find out more about Christian and his dark, secret past.  This novel also adds a little suspense, with surprising villains in this book.    I cannot wait for E L James 3rd book and I look forward to anything else this author has in store for us.  My only request, to see these 2 books (Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker) in Christian's point of view -that would be the ultimate!!

1612130283|5.0|I LOVE this book. I believe this book started as a Twilight fanfiction but it certainly has it's own identity and feel.  It does not involve any paranormal romance but E L James does not let her readers down with the dynamics of the main characters relationship - rich, powerful man vs. vulnerable, sweet girl -SWOON! I've read 3x now and cannot get enough! Definitely a book for adults but if you love erotic romance - this story is for you!!!  I love that it's in first person and I can immediately connect with the character Ana. I love her smart mouth and her smart thoughts in her head.  I love her honesty, vulnerability, and logic. I love the emails between Ana and Christian (the 2 main characters) - I cannot get enough!!! I could read an entire book of just their emails alone! I love the protectiveness of Christian, his ABSOSOLUTE power, his money, and most of all is his love and admiration for Ana.   The front cover alone of this book brings back YUMMY memories! Ladies be prepared to have your husband/boyfriend/partner standing nearby -this is a STEAMY read!!!  The end of this book is a to die for cliffhanger - I reccomend buying book no.2 before proceeding to the end (Fifty Shades Darker).  My hope is to have the author write these books in Christians point of view and that would be the ultimate!!!  My favorite sayings that I have now incorporated into my everyday converstions:  \\"That's a hard limit for me\\"  \\"Of Fifty, Fifty, Fifty\\"  \\"Palm twitching mad\\"
0307352145|5.0|If you're plagued by remarks like \\"you're too quiet\\" or \\"you need to be more outgoing\\" all your life (as I am), chances are, you're an introvert and this book's for you.<br /><br />In Quiet, Author Cain, an introvert herself, counters the misconceptions about introversion. Introverts, she says, are not people with a personality flaw. Rather, they are people who \\"recharge their batteries\\" by being alone (while extroverts recharge theirs by socializing). And contrary to prevailing notions about introverts, introverts _can_ be gregarious while extroverts, on the other hand, _can_ be shy (if you find such assertions counterintuitive, you have the idea of introversion all wrong).<br /><br />Cain submits that misconceptions on introversion creates a problem not only for introverts themselves but for society as a whole. Introverts are often passed up for promotion because they are generally perceived as less competent than their extroverted peers. At a societal level, Cain says such biases can have some serious socioeconomic ramifications (she cites, among other examples, the 2008 credit crunch and the 2000 \\"dot-bomb\\" crises -- both of which, she contends, would have been averted had the financial elite been introverts).<br /><br />Further, Cain says introversion (and often an accompanying \\"constellation\\" of traits such as perseverance and the ability of stay focused for long periods) is an absolutely vital quality in the men who have made some of the biggest contributions to the world. Without introverts, she points out, there would be no theory of relativity, no W.B. Yeats' \\"The Second Coming,\\" no Chopin's nocturnes, no Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" no Peter Pan, no Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm, no Google, etc. I would add to that list of no's the iPhone and iPad (the late Steve Jobs was described as an introvert and a recluse).<br /><br />Cain backs up her premise with a good deal of ground-breaking neuroscience research, which includes those done by Jerome Kagan (longitudinal studies on personality and high reactivity of introverts), Hans Eysenck (arousal theory of extraversion), and Elaine Aron (work on highly sensitive person (HSP)). The studies rely heavily on fMRI scans of different parts of the brain such as the Limbic system (primarily the amygdala) and the neocortex (primarily the frontal lobe). While far from being conclusive, these studies strongly suggest that introversion is a heritable trait. They also offer some revealing and fascinating insights into functional differences between the brains of introverts and those of extroverts. These and other findings are presented in a way that even a layperson such as myself can easily understand.<br /><br />Well-written and rigorously backed by a wealth of scientific research, Quiet is easily one of the best books I've ever read on neuroscience. For the guilt-ridden introvert who has subscribed to the belief that being an introvert is a bad thing, this book offers some measure of absolution. For the rest of us, it's a validation of what we've known all along -- which is why I find Quiet a truly empowering book for the introvert. *Highly* recommended.high reactivity of introverts), Hans Eysenck (arousal theory of extraversion), and Elaine Aron (work on highly sensitive person (HSP)).

B005FFW46S|3.0|I like the book. enjoyable read, and fun from beginning to the end. The only thing that irritates me is that the book is full of formatting errors, there are no markers to see where the next chapter starts, and there's even some misspelt words. I feel like the publisher used OCR technology to do this digital version of the book, and people who bought it are stuck with an inferior digital copy of a great man's literary work. I hope that the publisher will fix these errors, and updates the book accordingly.
B005IS565S|3.0|The songs (especially the solos) just sound so familiar in such a way that it almost sounds the same sometimes, personally I like it fresh. Other songs sound so completely different songs they lose the 5FDP charm. Songs I would recommend would be Under and Over it and Back for more. You'll have to be a die hard knuckle head to enjoy the majority of the other songs.   OVER ALL  Pros: New    Some VERY good songs    Different  Cons: A lot of mediocre songs     Different  Well thanks for reading all the way to the end. I can talk all day but the choice is yours to buy or not. See ya!

B005SZAEYO|5.0|Having only seen the first episode, it may be premature to review this show. That said, both my spouse and I love the show. While the basic plot is predictable and would seem done to death, (family moves for a fresh start and their new home is haunted), the show has so many parts that are unexpected and fresh. The cinematography is strong, as is the casting. One of the best things about the horrifying moments is that they are not explained adnauseum, as so many horror moments are these days. People who are not patient and need everything explained will likely not enjoy this. The lack of resolution is intentional and builds the viewers sense of discomfort and intrigue. Looking forward to more episodes!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Just listened to New Blood for the first time from start to finish and it is excellent! The arrangements with orchestra are very atmospheric and almost film score like at times. I've always been a big Peter Gabriel fan and also a big fan of film scores by composers like John Williams, Danny Elfman, Bernard Hermann, Hans Zimmer, Philip Glass, etc. This album is the best of both worlds.     Some of the highlights for me are \\"Rhythm of the Heat\\", \\"San Jacinto\\", \\"Wallflower\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Red Rain\\", \\"The Nest That Sailed The Sky\\" and \\"Solsbury Hill\\".     I've seen some reviews that aren't fond of \\"Solsbury Hill\\" but when I listen to the album straight through it really compliments the whole work and gives a dynamic ending to an excellent album!!! For me the last lines he is singing \\"I'm coming home....back home\\" make me think of the long and inspiring career he has had since that was his first really big hit as a solo artist and it deals with going for your dreams and following your heart no matter what the rest of the world may say.      I definitely recommend this to any Peter Gabriel fan and/or enthusiast of film score/ambient music.     [...]

B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I originally fell in love with this series when it debuted on AMC, so I cannot comment on how it stacks up to the comic book version that it is based off of.  The Blu-ray contains all six of the episodes that make up the first season.  My only complaint comes from that fact, six episodes leaves me desperately wanting more.  The zombie's in the series are beautifully done.  They stay true to the slow dumb zombie mold as opposed to the fast and thinking zombies that appear in some movies.  The zombie story has been told before, the main character wakes up from a coma to world that is incredibly different from the one he knew (stop me if this sounds familiar).  What sets this series apart from the countless other zombie stories out there is the character development.  The character story lines are wonderfully done and leave the viewer feeling a connection to the survivors.  The blu-ray quality on these were a little off-putting.  There were some scenes that were very grainey and kind of annoying.  I kind of overlooked it however because of how much a fan of the series I am, but if you're a person who dwells on blu-ray quality you may not be too happy with this.  Any fan of zombie fiction will love this series and I personally can't wait to see what direction they take it in.  After watching the first season I have become curious as to what the comics were like and may end up checking those out to see how different it is from the television portrayal.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This is the story of Dr. John Nash, an eccentric and enigmatic student. Princeton University is of prime importance here as far as the beginning of his schizophrenia. For a man that could see the solutions to problems that others would have said were impossible - or genius, even miraculous - it is not so far a stretch that he also saw people that were not there and in fact did not really exist.  The line between genius and insanity or brilliance and creativity is a fine one. And perhaps the people he hallucinated about, being his 'friends,' were what kept him from further demise (particularly the 'prodigal roommate' and his niece; the man in the hat, to a lesser extent). He was totally a self-made man of his own effort. As for insulin shock treatments, they supposedly were effective in about 50% of patients, and then perhaps due to brain damage.   A wonderful movie. I am going to read the book next.

B0007DFJ0G|5.0|If you plan to read the book I would suggest reading it first before watching the movie - if you read it afterwards you might be disappointed. Don't get me wrong; the book has a few more details and the author's afterword is nice in giving you the story's history. But the plot, I feel, is more action-oriented and therefore better suited for tv.   The themes here will make you question everything except the immediacy of the moment, the here-and-now. Being a downshifter, living in and dealing with the consumerist system but not being of it, the many 'selves' we have (and projection of the shadow side) in a fickle-minded society going on as if they will live forever, and dying never having lived. In addition to this is the need for male initiation where fathers are deadbeats or absent outsiders, and knowing who and what you are as a self-sufficient and self-reliant individual distinct from the herd mindset - qualities which cannot be touched, bought or sold, or change on a whim (certainly not from any external influence).   In his saying,\\"You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world,\\" I realize the lesson here in existentialism is not about finding some ultimately materialistic (and temporary) idea of happiness, but about finding and creating meaning to one's life. I am also reminded of when he says,\\"It all started with Marla Singer.\\" She mirrored his farce; she made him feel self-conscious and in fact they first connected on that level (they didn't belong, after all).

The materials listed are easily obtained, the patterns are full size and are easily traced on to the fabric.  Each step  of the work is explained in both pictures as well as text.

0756405890|5.0|After Robin  Hobb it took my a little while to get really into the first book of this writer, but after that....... LOVE IT ! can't wait till book 3 has come out.
0439023521|4.0|I couldn't put this book down! This novel is incomparable to any other. The storyline, characters and events all had me mesmerized. The author, Suzanne Collins, has one of the most original storylines. She creates them off the top of her head, and it's phenomenal. She had me hooked the whole way through. Some of the best parts were violent, and some extremely compassionate.         The story includes many settings and locations. But three environments stood out to being most significant; District twelve, the arena, and the capitol. District 12 is the district that Katniss Everdeen (main character), resides in. She lives with her mother and sister, Primrose. Twelve is beyond doubt a poverty-stricken district. Many families are starving. Not many jobs are to be had. These people don't live a joyful life unless they try to. Many family members died in a mine accident, leaving many families lonely and depressed.   The second setting, the arena is completely terrifying. The arena is where the 24 tributes fight to the death, between ages 12-18. Many innocent lives are lost, all for the entertainment of the capitol's citizens. The last and final significant setting is the capitol. The capitol, and the whole country of Panem, is ruled by a terrible man by the name of President Snow. The capitol is very rich and really enforces the rules of the Hunger games.    The characters are by far the most interesting and attention-capturing aspect of the novel. They make the story. My favorite, however, is Rue. Rue is a petite and little twelve year old girl from district 11, who becomes allies with Katniss early on in the story. Katniss cares for her until she dies, which broke my heart.       The problem that is trying to be solved in this whole story is to get Katniss and Peeta out of the arena, still breathing with a beating heart. Although it seems impossible, they actually pull it off! They completed this almost impossible act by showing strong and rebellious actions, causingthe games to conclude.     One specific event that really stood out to me is when Katniss and Peeta first team up and reside in a small cave. They learned that they really don't hate each other, and they decided to team up as allies trying to win the games together. They survive by sharing the gifts that they both receive from the games sponsors. After caretaking for each other, they fall in love. They become very passionate for one another, and the whole way through the book, they leave you hoping that they come out together and live happily ever after.  But all great novels must come to and end. The two lovebirds escape the horrific arena and return back to their families in district 12. But the fame has just begun. They still have a victory tour to do, consuming much of their time. But hey, wouldn't you rather be touring Panem instead of being dead? This book will always be a top 5 contender on my list.
B005LY3VRO|3.0|This disc is a massive hit & miss....not because it is a remix cd, but because it has only 10 tracks & some are inferior....there are PLENTY of other remixes for these songs that could have been listed and were ignored....not to mention there is no mix for \\"Break The Ice\\" or \\"Hold It Against Me\\". And that cover is terrible...what was RCA thinking?  And so, out of annoyance, I compiled my own track list together in which I called it:  \\"B In The Mix: The Remixes Vol 2. Supreme Edition\\"  Some tracks are still the same,  but the majority are different, including a track that has yet to be officially released!  Here is the track listing:  Gimme More (Kaskade Club Mix)  Piece of Me (Bimbo Jones Club Mix)  Break the Ice (Jason Nevins Extended)  Womanizer (Benny Benassi Extended Mix)  Circus (Villains Remix)  If U Seek Amy (U-Tern Remix)  Radar (Manhattan Clique UHF Remix)   Burning Up (Bit Error Vocal Mix) --- Britney's version of the Madonna song (performed on her Femme Fatale Tour)  3 (Manhattan Clique Remix)  Hold It Against Me (Funk Generation Club Remix)  Till the World Ends (Alex Suarez Remix)  I Wanna Go (Armand Deluxe Radio Mix)  Criminal (Varsity Team Extended)  S&M (feat.

Listen to the mass product version of this and then try my recommendations; tell me mine isn't as good.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|This movie is pure enjoyment. It also has a special meaning for my husband and me. We followed Secretariat when he ran his races and amazed everyone with his ability. We remember Penny Tweedy, Lucien Lauren, and Ron Turcotte. Our daughters were only 3 and 4 when we visited Claiborne Farms in 1975 and had our pictures taken next to Big Red. Almost 40 years later, we watched this movie together. It was very authentic and a wonderful remembrance of a super athlete. We've watched it several times and each time the excitement is still there. Knowing it's a true story and yet, so unbelievable, makes it well worth watching. The actors did a fantastic job. This is a movie everyone should watch.

0142418218|1.0|I enjoyed Roald Dahl's books enormously as a child. I used to sincerely believe that outer space was inhabited by Vermicious Knids. But the new illustrations seriously detract from the book. They look like they were scribbled in five minutes by a hack comic strip artist. They have neither skill nor charm. Sorry, but I can't stand Quentin Blake's style. Also, the cheap paper has a very unpleasant texture, and the binding makes the book difficult to read. If I re-read Roald Dahl's books it'll be in a used older edition.

I could stop reading them and all I wanted to do was know what happened next. I read all three books in about 2 weeks :) I love the way Suzanne Collins paints a picture in your head while you are reading the Hunger games and you fall in love with almost every character she's created. This book will make you laugh, cry and leave you wanting more.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|Let me start by saying, that I have read some of the negative reviews, while I can appreciate some of them, I do not understand certain claims like they've gone mainstream. I actually think most of the album would not go over well by the mainstream, because the sound of the album does not conform to pop mainstream standards. Their most mainstream song on the album, What You Want, is the one they have released as the first single, but honestly, that is what you can call the 'most' mainstream song on the entire album. Plus, I've never been convinced that mainstream is such an overtly evil thing, as there is some good music in mainstream, like Adele. Admittedly, there is a lot on the chart that is, well, not great, but there are some things on the charts that are quite good, so lets not go burn mainstream in an effigy quite yet. Especially as we, the consumers, have the power to speak with our wallets.  I also find it quite funny while one camp insists the songs on this album sound like every other song on the other albums, another contingent insists this doesn't sound like Evanescence's other songs at all. I think the fact that there is this much debate about what the album sounds like means they've done their job. And I also think that both camps are right, it is and it isn't like Evanescence's catalogue.  This album isn't for everyone. If you truly expect another Fallen or another Open Door, I don't think you are going to be satisfied. Yes, that Evanescence feeling and element is in each song, but I think the crafting of each song is different this time around and does produce a bit of a different sound that distinguishes it from the other albums and other songs. That doesn't mean that it does not have similarities to some of Evanescence's other songs, but simililar doesn't mean it isn't different in its own way.  In regards to the songs, there are a few that I'm not in love with (What you Want, Sick), but there are some songs that I think are better than some of Evanescence's old stuff (My Heart Is Broken, Lost in Paradise, The Change, Secret Door). I am actually surprised that one reviewer hated Swimming Home, because in my opinion, that is one of the best songs on the album, because it's so different from the other songs on the album and really evokes the feeling of calmness within tragedy. To each his own, I guess.  Are all songs great on the new album? No, as I've pointed out before, there are some songs that I'm not feeling, but those are few and far between. Overall, I think this album showcases some of their best work and true musicianship.   I think what hits home the most in this album are some of the melodies. In songs such as; My Heart is Broken and Lost in Paradise, you have this very deep emotion that is coming out through both voice and piano, accompanied by crunching guitars, drum and a bass, but it works because it pushes the emotion higher. I adore Amy Lee's voice, I think her voice is one of the very best there is among today's female vocalists, because it can reach soaring heights and crushing lows and carry heavy emotion within it. She can make us feel with her voice and that is what a gifted singer can do.   In terms of lyrics, I don't know if this album truly features the best lyrics there are compared to other Evanescence songs, but some of the lyrics on this album are actually quite good. The pain she describes in Lost in Paradise is something I can understand and relate to and it works with the melody. That is the important thing in these songs, the melody, the lyrics and her voice work in tandem and push the quality of the songs higher and higher. These blended elements are what pushes this album from a merely good album to a great album.  Overall, I think it comes down to what you like. I like the creativity and sound of the new album. I truly feel like they built the sound of this album brick by brick and they came out with something great. I like the fact that some of the songs are emotional outpourings of pain or anguish, while others just make you want to rock your socks off.  Why did I give it five stars? Overall, I do feel this is their best work yet. Their sound has become bigger, the emotions more raw and it still can rock me out like nothing else. I loved Fallen, but I feel it lacked maturity. I loved the Open Door, but I didn't feel there was a stand out song on there. I absolutely adore the self-titled album, because I think they really outdid themselves with most of the material. Quite simply, this album speaks to me and affects me deeply, which is how I know it's good.
1423113454|4.0|Summary  After their mother died, Sadie and Carter were separated. Sadie was forced to live with her grandparents in London, England and has a pretty \\"normal\\" life. Meanwhile, Carter is traveling the world with their father, the amazing and brilliant Egyptologist Julius Kane. Sadie has what Carter wants: friends and a \\"normal\\" life, and Carter has what Sadie wants: a chance to be with their father. On Christmas Eve, the family is reunited, and Julius takes his children to a British museum to \\"make things right\\". When Julius summons a god, a cryptic and mysterious figure shows up and quickly banishes Julius and causes a fiery explosion in the museum. Sadie and Carter discover that Set, the worst of all gods, is awakening and has a horrible plan to destroy the Kanes. Will Carter and Sadie be able to stop Set's nefarious plan to destroy them and save their father?  External Connections  This book is one of a kind, and has a very unique plot.  However, I can relate this book to another book named The Lightening Thief by Rick Riordan. Both of the books involve Greek mythology and Greek mythological monsters and gods. In The Lightening Thief, Greek gods seem to be coming right out of Percy's Greek mythology textbook, and Percy has a angered a few of them, including Zeus. In The Red Pyramid, Carter and Sadie's dad summons a god and has made Set very angry. In both books, the gods are really angry with the main characters, and their problems will not be resolved until Percy, Carter, and Sadie can bring peace between the humans and the gods.  Personal Connection  When I was little I used to pretend that mysterious creatures would come to life. We would solve challenging mysteries with each other. Eventually one of my made up creatures would be evil, and have a plan to destroy me and my family. I would have to find out a way to destroy that evil creature first before he could get to my family. Even though I cannot remember the evil creature's name and what it looked like, I have a positive feeling it had the same reason to destroy me, as Set wanted to destroy the Kane family.  Recommendation  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Greek mythology and mythological creatures. After learning about x-ray reading, I was able feel the authors meaning of the book. Rick Riordan has written an amazing book. The author has a beautiful ability to tell the story of how family is really important, but he conveys it in a fun and exciting way. The book is very action-packed, but touching without being too melodramatic.
0062011847|5.0|Plenty of people have written about what Snuff is about, so I see no need to cover it, other than to say that the title refers to plot decoration more than to the focus of the book in both senses of the word snuff.  In fact, for quite a bit of the book it seemed like the title should have been \\"Poo\\".  What I think is most important is the fact that I think this book is the funniest he has ever written, and I hope that he can continue to keep them coming.  Snuff is about 400 pages long, and somewhat more meaty of a book than normal.  I had planned to finish it yesterday, but it took longer than I expected.  This is another book about Commander Vimes, and another book that adds a new and colorful watchmen to the list of notable characters.  I hear the kindle version is terrible.  That's what you get for not reading a real book!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|I received this movie in a very timely manner, which I appreciate. And the movie is in Great condition.Thanks again for the great experience.
0062060554|3.0|3 stars. It sucks to have to type a review in order to rate an item to get recommendations now that they've taken that feature away. If it irritates you to have to read this, tell Amazon.com to bring back the \\"rate this item\\" feature.<br /><br />I would have given this 4 stars if there weren't so many obvious plot holes and things that weren't explained compounded by the fact that other things were explained over and over until I was sick of the repetitiveness.  Also, anyone who has seen the movie \\"50 First Dates\\" can't help but think of many things that Christine or her loved ones could have done to help her weave a thread of memory that could have been referred to each morning instead of going through the same long secretive discovery process every day.  Great ideas in this novel but it just didn't all gel together very well for me personally.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|Just a small complaint about the bonus materials, having previously gotten The Mist to get the B&W version I was excited to get my hands on this for the B&W version of the pilot episode.  I'm happy to say it looked just as amazing as The Mist b&w transfer and it did a great job of changing the feel of the episode entirely...that being said for some reason it only has a DD2.0 audio track available.  Its a really odd corner to cut if you ask me. Why they didnt include the TrueHD audio track is really really disappointing.  Other complaint is there is no sleeve for the set, so the bonus goodies that came inside will need to find a new home or you will have to deal with them falling out of the box set every time you pick it up.    Great show, everyone should give it a shot!
B003L77GRO|1.0|I got this item and watched it right away. The last episodeon the 2nd disk skipped really badly. Unable towatch the last 15 minutes. Sort of a problem since I have never seen the episode before. Then the third disk had random little skips. I contacted the seller and was told send it back and I will refund it no problem.I was very happy and impressed with the service. I mailed it back on 9-12-11. Havent been refunded. Contacted the seller, he asked for my tracking number, I dont have one since I shipped it USPS from my job. Never heard from the seller again. I have emailed him several times. Looks like I have no product and Im out about 30.00. Wont order from this seller again. I was very cooperative and gave many chances to right the wrong.  For the record THIS SEASON OF DEXTER IS AMAZING. The parts we saw were amazing!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game but it loses level progress on close occasionally and makes me have to restart completely. Possibly loses progress when game is forced into background since app doesn't have the ability to read phone state. Still worth all 99 pennies, if you like puzzles you will enjoy this game.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|This CD is stunning! The band just sizzles and sparkles. Every time I play it, I hear more. The CD grows in my estimation and enjoyment with each listen. Turn this one UP on a really fine stereo or great headphones. Amy is earthy, riveting, and sings with heart-reaching emotion.  I intend to purchase her CD, \\"Frank\\" today.  The only downer here is knowing she had to die so young. It's hard to come to terms with the fact that no new music will be written and sung by her; however, her music will stand the test of time and live on and on.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|What the ----!!!  I am still reeling from the best season finale I have ever seen. I thought season 3's \\"Full Measures\\" was awesome but this blew me away.  The whole cast 'Rocks'.  Gilligan (The Creator) really put the icing on the cake.  Everything came together perfectly and still left room for next season.  I never speculate about Breaking Bad because it is so much more fun to wait and see what Gilligan will come up with next.  I am not sure what I will do when the series ends because the show has become my favorite thing to watch, hands down. Cranston, Paul, and Esposito are the ultimate actors.  Gus became one of my favorites and when he walked out of that nursing home room I was on my feet saying \\"What?, What?\\" then the panorama to his right side and I nearly fell over.  Then I started laughing because of the episodes title. Gilligan, you are a genius. I own a copy of every season and can't wait for season 4 to go on sale. If you haven't seen this show you need to hurry up and see it from season one to four.  I guarantee you will be hooked from start to finish.
B0058WFO06|5.0|One of the greatest modern musicians alive today, Steven Wilson has yet again outdone himself with his latest release 'Grace For Drowning'. High-fidelity headphones are a MUST for this masterpiece! And the special edition book is amazingly BEAUTIFUL! (Great job Steven!)
B005COO1X6|1.0|I did not care for this story at all. Thank goodness it was only $.99...It literally made me gag. Sorry SK fans...I thought it was disgusting...
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD. IT WAS ALOT BETTER THAN I HAD HOPED. GREAT FOR PARTYS. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS IF YOU LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I thought I was buying this new but it came to me already opened and taped shut.  Looked a bit dirty like it had been kicked around on the floor.  Not too bad for putting an ok edge back on a dull knife but wont put a razors edge on.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|After an awkward attempt with 'Outsourced' the small screen returns with another sitcom involving the economy. This time, they get it right.<br /><br />This CBS sitcom examines how two 'different' young women attempt to make ends meet  in the current American economy. Max (Kat Dennings) has always been working class, but poverty is a new and really unpleasant surprise for Caroline (Beth Behrs). She had been rich, until her family lost all of it's money from dad's ponzi scheme.<br /><br />The odd-couple friendship successfully works because they are both genuinely likable characters. They are both discovering what the world is currently like while struggling in a low-paying service sector job. This is where the storylines and comedy comes in.<br /><br />Caroline is gennuinely shocked to discover what a 'public dental clinic' looks like. Or some people must delay obtaining their needed treatment altogether until pain is intolerable.But she proactively realized that selling off her massive wardrobe will bring in lots of needed money for the two roomates to live on. She had already started thrift shopping at the local Goodwill.<br /><br />Viewers have watched a 'struggling young roommates' storyline many times before but the creators and writers artfully balance out comedy with economic-political reality here. Timely storylines are entertaining.<br /><br />Becoming low-income is something she had never expected, Caroline is however most challenged when a former boyfriend unexpectedly comes to the dinner where she now works. Having somebody from her former world now seeing her current situation is embarrassing: The rich are not expected to 'work' because of economic wealth and what it means.She however survives to tell the tale. And she discovers real friends like her for who she is, not for how much money she has.<br /><br />Watching this sitcom, I could not help but feel that I was being visited by the ghost of Norman Lear. The 'issue' writing and the character development are that well tuned on current issues without loosing the comedy. It is definitely something which everybody--and not just girls--are going to like watching.oosing the comedy. It is definitely something which everybody--and not just girls--are going to like watching.
B005IS565S|5.0|I'm so glad that 5FDP didn't turn out to be one of the growing number of bands that think they need to completely change their sound for their 3rd CD. They do a couple songs that are a little different than the first 2, but nothing drastic and they do it very well. All the songs have a great feel to them, powerful riffs, and lyrics. I'll keep this one on repeat for a while.
B004EPZ08E|2.0|we didn't think jennifer aniston would chose a script this far in the gutter.  some parts were cute, but another movie that takes sophomoric another flush lower. avoid.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|When the Green Lantern Corps comes under attack by a new threat, Hal Jordan becomes the first human ever chosen to become one of the galaxy's defenders. Hal is a test pilot, cocky and reckless. And the Corps doesn't believe that Hal or humanity is worthy to join their ranks. But humanity may have what the Corps has been missing in their fight against Parallax - willpower.<br /><br />Hal Jordan (played by Ryan Reynolds) is brazen, courageous, and witty. When the Green Lantern ring chooses him, with no instructions, humor ensues. As with other super hero origin stories, Hal takes a while to learn and train his newly found power. Seeing early clips and images, I was worried that the Green Lantern aliens would be too corny and ridiculous-looking for comic-to-film adaptation. And while there still was a bit of hokey-ness at times, I was really impressed on how the aliens were handled and at the amazing CGI.<br /><br />It does help to go in to movies with lower expectations. I actually thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the story and the characters. The main villain Hector, Parallax's puppet, (played by Peter Sarsgaard) is a tortured, almost sympathetic character. And Mark Strong as Sinestro is simply fantastic. As science fiction and comic book fan, I was swept away in the action and amazing special effects, as the hero travels to and from space. Loaded with adventure, mystery, romance, bizarre aliens, and plenty of laughs, Green Lantern is a fun, fast-paced thrill ride.<br /><br />\\"Green Lantern\\" Blu-ray Combo Pack includes:<br /><br />* Extended Cut<br />* Theatrical Film<br />* Maximum Movie Mode with Picture in Picture Pods<br />* The Universe According to Green Lantern<br />* Ryan Reynolds Becomes Green Lantern<br />* Justice League #1 Digital Comic<br />* Additional Scenes<br />* Preview of Green Lantern: The Animated Series<br />* BD-Live
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The game has kept me playing for quite a while, and the difficulty level varies quite a bit. Got it free but would also pay for it.

B003TML0VO|4.0|For an old geezer in his sixties (I'm not too far behind), Carlos is still pretty cool (plus he has even embarked on a new career with the Cleveland Indians, har har).  I'm not sure what folks are grumbling about.  Yes, these versions are not the equal of the originals, and not every track works, and the sound is compressed (still sounded pretty good on my rig, though), but there aren't many albums that have repeatedly gotten me grinning like a stoned monkey as I listened to the blistering guitar licks he lays on these songs.  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" starts quietly but builds up not once but twice to extravaganzas of furious feedback-drenched fretwork; \\"Dance the Night Away\\" is a great guitar-pop song when shed of those ridiculous DLRoth whoops; \\"Bang a Gong\\" and \\"Little Wing\\" are impressive variations on great originals.  As I counted, only two tracks (\\"Photograph\\" and \\"Back in Black\\") fall flat, the rest are a lot of fun--
B004EPZ08E|1.0|How is it not illegal to tell us that you get a DIGITAL COPY only to play from flixster as a streaming video. This is not the first time WB has done this on movies. If you say it is my digital copy then make it possible for me to watch it on the device I want. The Blu Ray plays on all Blu Ray players so why can't I watch this on my IPOD.  I payed good money only to be ripped off.  I spent the 8.00 dollars more and can't use it.
014241722X|5.0|While it is written for a younger person about 12-16, I am an older person (63) and I really enjoyed reading it.  It is not written in a childish manner and the adult reader could well enjoy the story line and various twists, but a younger person could easily grasp the legal information and not feel as though they are being talked 'down' to.  I have always enjoyed reading John Grisham's books and this was no different.  I am planning on passing it along to my friend (same age as me), as I know she will enjoy reading it too.  I actually enjoyed it more than some of the new adult lawyer novels I have read recently.  I think it's because Mr. Grisham knows the law and he never seems to write about things you know are just to far fetched to be true.  I would recommend this book to anyone from age 12-80.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Hounded got such high reviews that I decided to give it a try. It has been compared to Dresden Files, so that ratcheted up my expectations quite a bit... big mistake. Dresden Files is some of the best urban fantasy out there. Druid Chronicles doesn't come close to the depth, complexity, humor, action packed plot, or creativity of Dresden Files. So, comparing it to DF is really not doing Druid Chronicles any favors.   The writer does have writing skill, so the book is not hard to read. In my opinion, every aspect of the story: characters, plot, setting, and pacing need to be fleshed out a bit more. The story seemed very shallow and underdeveloped to me. The secondary characters are not interesting at all, except Oberon. I didn't get any feeling of affection for or from his \\"friends.\\" The villain doesn't show up until the very end and doesn't hang around for long, so there is no tension built up between them at all. Atticus himself is not very complex. He is 2100 years old, but has no real depth. He is pretty happy-go-lucky, not what you'd expect from someone who has seen most of written history unfold. There is no mention of his family except a sentence to say that his father was not affectionate. He's a bit cheeky with the gods and never gets slapped down for it.   The plot has promise, but the rest of the story elements are so lackluster that the plot's potential is lost.   The setting also has promise. The desert is mysterious and dangerous. But, instead of living out in it Atticus lives in a suburban neighborhood where sword fights with gods and gangs of mythical creatures goes largely unnoticed. That aspect really threw me. I kept expecting some explanation as to why no one noticed this major battle going on. But, it seems the nosy neighbor with a grudge against him is the only one to take notice... really?   As for pacing, the down time was for info dumping. The action sequences were pretty good, but it wasn't all that hard on Atticus. He heals up pretty quickly, gains great strength from the earth, and has a charmed necklace strong enough to protect him from gods. He's just got the odds stacked too much in his favor to make it interesting.   If the author would address these issues his future books could stand up to being compared to Dresden Files.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was never forced to rate this after over a dozen levels. fun and i like the aesthetic. no bugs so far on nexus s.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The keyboard itself is awesome. It's predictions are solid. I can almost guarantee that while using it you will have to uninstall and reinstall it due to the fact that it will fail to download language packs. This really sucks because it can be a pain in the butt to reinstall considering it just randomly fails to download sometimes.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing - wonderful characterization, incredible world creation - if you love epics / fantasy, you will not be disappointed.
0743277708|5.0|This book is phenomenal.  It was read to me when I was a child, and I have since returned to it as an adult.  It is the Lord of the Rings of animal stories; Adams creates an entire world, complete with languages and mythology unique to the animals themselves.  The characters are rich and varied, and they each have their own function/role within the story.  The story itself follows the classic hero arc, but it is entertaining and surprising despite that (and it is a classic for a reason).  This story is a must read for adolescents/young adults and adults alike, particularly for animal lovers.  It is not one you will soon forget.  It is hard to find anything negative to stay about this story - it is a bit long, and at times is not the easiest reading, but it is important to remember that it was written decades ago.  All in all the story is extremely engaging, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story.
0553582038|3.0|I will start by saying that I love the series, and will stick with it till the end.<br />However coming off the tremendous high that was \\"A Storm Of Swords\\" this one was a bit of a let down.<br />Too many new characters are introduced, and while some are quite good like Cersei and Brienne, many others make you wonder why they are there in the first place.<br />Maybe once all the books are done this one will grow to become more appreciated, but for me it was a bit of a gamble that did not pay off.<br /><br />Still, like I said, bring it on Martin, you have me till the end.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Unless you're a complete philistine who hates good music, get this.  «No flames please, i'm just excited!»  In this listener's humble opinion, this is even better than `Scratch My Back'; same beautiful treatment, but Peter's songs are better.  Production quality is the usual spectacular perfection we've come to expect from this genius.
055357342X|5.0|Never have I read a 1200 page book so quickly in my life. I liked Martin before, but never quite got the \\"American Tolkien\\" reference that got thrown around so much.....till this book.<br />I actually prefer him to Tolkien, his characters feel incredibly real and it almost feels like you are reading some actual amazing historical event instead of some fantasy.<br /><br />I think I will read this one again...right...about NOW.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|After the events of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) has revealed to the world and himself that he is Iron-Man as he is making history. Ivan Vanko (Michael Rouke Jr.) avenges his father's death whom his father believed his ideas were stolen by the Starks years ago, Ivan becomes Whiplash who is hellbent on destroying Stark. However, Tony is dealing with some health problems from that radiation of his artificial heart energy source but needs to make an improved one that can cure him and make him better. Now with the help of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), James Rhodes (Don Chadel), Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) he must conflict an enemy worse than the last one he dealt with.<br /><br />A terrific and entertaining sequel to the surprisingly well done 2008 Marvel film, Jon Feravue returns back as director. I like how this movie deals with conflict including great character development and good acting. The action sequences are even bigger this time around including a very satisfying race track sequence that is just mind-blowing. There's also psychological issues in the film on the main character's conflict about what he is dealing with even with his love for Pepper. I should say this is a very good sequel that sets up for \\"Thor\\" at the very end of this movie.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray/DVD combo offers fresh brilliant picture and sound quality that skyrockets to the roof with wonderful extras like audio commentary, Footage Scan Mode which explores SHIELD data that pops up during the movie, The Vault which digs deeper into weapons and all that kind of stuff. On-and-off storyboards and animatics during the movie, 8 deleted scenes, documentary, featurettes, art galleries, trailers, music video and Marvel trailers.
0553801473|1.0|I actually got an autographed copy of A Dance With Dragons. GRRM came to the Tattered Cover in Denver for a book signing. I couldn't actually make it to the signing but was able to request an autographed copy. The next time I was in Denver, I picked it up and held it lovingly, afraid to mar the beautiful silver cover. As soon as I got back home, I started reading, expecting to devour the thing in one sitting (okay...may be 2!) much like I did the last Harry Potter book. I had my glass of water and plenty of snacks to sustain me during the hard-core reading expedition. I opened the book, expecting to be blown away by Martin's genius, gasping at the twists and turns, reveling in people getting their comeuppance, you know, all the things we have grown to love from Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />It actually took me MONTHS to get through Dance With Dragons, something that has never happened to me with any of the other books of the series even considering that I've read through the first four about seven times EACH! I never skip entire pages, nor leave the book sitting forgotten on the side of the couch collecting dust! NEVER!<br /><br />The only thing that kept me going was the hope that SOMETHING would happen, something important or exciting, or dramatic. Talk about being left wanting. As I read this, I got the feeling that Martin had lost complete control of his story and that he was simply filling pages with unnecessary descriptions and such to try to hide the fact that the essential parts of Dance With Dragons could be boiled down to probably something more along the lines of a novella.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll read the next book of the series but I won't be on the edge of my seat. I may even wait and check it out from the library, something I NEVER do with favorite books. I love buying them and having them on my shelf to read over and over again.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Great, low-cost method of converting those old tapes to mp3. I found all my old tapes when cleaning out my basement. Immediately, I had to listen to them but all I had was an old, dead walkman, no tape player in my car and not a boombox to speak of. I immediately went to Amazon to find a solution. This was it - only $25 and works with my PC.  The unit itself isn't rock solid. It's made of plastic and will break if you drop it or mistreat it in any way. But left in good hands, this should last a while - and I only need it to convert my tapes once. I followed the little instruction booklet to install the driver (I'm running Windows 7 Pro on a Dell XPS machine). Just plug in the device to a USB port with the included cable and the driver installs automagically. It uses a generic audio driver and then is recognized by your machine as an audio input device, basically a microphone. Now, just install Audacity from the small disk that's included. You can download Audacity for free and install it that way if you prefer, but the disk does come with the mp3 codec needed to convert the raw audio to mp3. Anyway, I installed from disk and followed set my preferences as instructed and had no issues with mp3 conversion. When I first fired up the tape device and pressed play and record in Audacity... NOTHING!?!?!  Well, I'm an idiot I guess. I had the volume on the unit all the way down so no audio was coming through. The instructions don't mention anything about setting the volume all the way up, and frankly I thought the volume was strictly for the headphone jack, but you'll want to do that to get the strongest audio signal as possible. As soon as I did that - BAM! - worked like a charm. I then recorded my tapes and saved each side as audacity projects so that I could go back later and cut up the tracks so I could save each track as an mp3 with all details. This way, iTunes will look at it as the actual album and download the artwork, etc.  The entire process is a bit time-consuming and it does require some basic knowledge of audio editing, especially if you're going to separate the tracks as I did. If you've used Audacity, Garageband, or any other audio editing tool then you'll have no problems. If you've never used one, then download Audacity for free and play around a bit before you try converting all your cassettes.   Finished mp3 files are lower fidelity than original digital files, and there is some tape noise that comes through, but all in all if you want to keep your treasures with you forever, especially those that you can't buy or reproduce anymore, then I would recommend picking this unit up and giving it a try.
B005GVA2L0|2.0|I already know this review will be the \\"least helpful\\" due to diehard fans upset at anything lower than 5 stars, but who cares. It goes to show you how predictable people are...much like I wish the album would have been.  Something from this album is missing that made them so unique. The best way to describe the album (and forgive the loose term \\"goth\\") is this: Fallen was goth + rock, The Open Door was really goth only, and this album is simply put, only rock. Not a single choir at all unless the music's drowning it out. For a songwriter who is very talented, this album sounds like...well, anything else on the radio.  There are, however, a few songs worth listening to that successfully has the different style the band wanted AND sounds good at the same time. Lost In Paradise preserves some of their old sound plus I would love to see more stuff like Secret Door in the future. But if anything can be said there is a bright side; at least the album doesn't have anything else on it like Swimming Home.
B005IS565S|5.0|I've been a diehard Knucklehead since the band's first album, \\"The Way of the Fist\\", and this is by far my favorite album. The hard songs are so hardcore, they just reach out of your speakers and smack you like a freight train. The deeper songs, have so much meaning in them, you just feel it. This album is a true masterpiece. In a world where the music industry is suffering, thank you Five Finger Death Punch for keeping GOOD music alive!
B004SC7B6M|5.0|Some bands can change their style while still preserving their unique sound while others simply can't. Within Temptation is one of those bands that can pull it off and it's evident on this album. Just when I thought they could never make another song that lives up to \\"All I Need\\" they go and release \\"Lost.\\" Personally I love their use of choirs and I was a bit disappointed to find out The Unforgiving hardly had any songs including them, but surprisingly it isn't missed. I found the album very enjoyable even without one of the elements that made me fall in love with them. Now if only they could come back to the states for a tour.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I share most every rewiwers opinion about this box set. Who needs the nonsence mercendise?! It only makes the release \\"cheap\\"(!). We need all the cd´s, dvd, blueray AND the vinyl AND a hardcover book with the story of making the album, the tours etc. The Stones Excile On Main Street is a gorgeous boxset!! And The Who Quadrophenia seemes to have that great standard. I will not bother with the other Immersion box sets!
B0058WFO06|5.0|Steven Wilson's second released-under-his-own-name solo record Grace for Drowning comes with beautiful packaging in the usual style of Carl Glover and Lasse Hoile. While the dark, surreal aesthetics might not be everyone's cup of tea, they certainly link the album to 2009's Insurgentes.  On first impression the album appears less structured and more eclectic than usual, even for Wilson, but beautiful and very appealing on an instinctive, emotional level. In terms of style, Grace for Drowning fuses the jazz-influences of early progressive rock (someone's been remixing King Crimson for years) with neo-romantic choir arrangements, delicate art rock and Wilsons fascination with industrial sounds and noise that so strongly influenced The Incident and Insurgentes. Partly, the instrumental passages are reminiscent of representatives of classical minimal music, e.g.Arvo Pärt and Philip Glass.  After a few listenings, the album becomes more comprehensive and appears more clearly structured. Wilson's talent for long, slow arcs of suspense seems to clash with his love of stark contrast and a huge dynamic range, but Grace for Drowning combines the three exceptionally well. The result surprises in its artistic unity and combines apparently contradictory genres with the majestic melodies and beautiful soundscapes that make it sound essentially like Steven Wilson. Grace for Drowning derives its coherence from a complex sound design, stylised textures and the editing of vocals and guitars typical of Wilson's work.  In terms of lyrics, the album moves from the intuitive writing of Insurgentes (and IMO rightly so) towards a more concise and palpable imagery.  The record demands persistence and a little work from the listener and may not be easily accessible to each and every Wilson fan, but it is worth the while. I personally thought it made the most sense when juxtaposed to Opeth's Heritage.

B002OEBMN4|5.0|I've listened to Slayer since 1985. I have waited a year to review this and I feel like it is one of their best albums.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics having become so ingrained in popular culture, fellow nerds can probably recite them with greater facility than the pledge of allegiance (which is actually sort of sad). I, ROBOT is a loose, roundabout film adaptation of Asimov's work. While it does explore Asimov's more cerebral themes, it emphasizes action and suspense and is tailored towards Will Smith's skills set. So I wouldn't say that it clings firmly to the spirit of Asimov's novels. But, setting that aside, I had fun watching this. Will Smith rarely disappoints.<br /><br />\\"Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine, random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols.\\" So goes James Cromwell's voiceover, establishing a plot thread, engaging in moody foreshadowing. In the year 2035, in a world populated by safe robotic servants, Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner investigates the suicide of eminent scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), co-founder and primary designer of U.S. Robotics. Except that to Spooner's trained eye, the suicide theory comes off as skeevy, much to everyone else's disgust. But there's a connection between Spooner and the dead scientist which we eventually learn. Spooner believes that Lanning has deliberately left a trail of bread crumbs for him to follow. Spooner smells a conspiracy. Except that no one's buying his hunch, not when his robot paranoia is so apparent. An early scene demonstrates Spooner's deep-seated prejudices against automatons. In this scene he glimpses a robot loping along with a purse and he instantly sets out in pursuit, assuming (falsely) that the robot was guilty of purse-snatching. Never mind that, historically, no crimes have ever been perpetrated by a robot. The 3 Laws Safe, hardwired into its positronic brain, have always governed a robot's behavior, curbed any and all potentially harmful act.<br /><br />Spooner's digging for clues in the towering U.S. Robotics facility leads him to encounters with various characters of note. Bruce Greenwood plays a shady executive at U.S. Robotics, and, yes, he immediately registers on Spooner's radar. Greenwood is pushing to mobilize the corporation's latest robot model, the NS-5, seeking to place one in every home. The detached and very literal Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) is, ironically, a robot psychologist. She specializes in facilitating the interface between humans and robots. She strives to make the robots seem more human. Spooner has loads of fun tweaking her. Spooner also meets two non-humans: VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), the A.I. who runs operations at U.S. Robotics. And Sonny the prototype NS-5 model. Sonny is strikingly different from its fellow robots. As voiced by Alan Tudyk, Sonny projects an inquisitiveness and an appealing sense of individuality. But its suspicious conduct plants him square on top of Spooner's suspect list, and never mind Asimov's Three Robotic Laws. It turns out, there are ghosts in the machine.<br /><br />The closing credits indicate that the film was \\"suggested\\" by Isaac Asimov's anthology book, and \\"suggested\\" is right. By no means does I, ROBOT adhere to Asimov's stories. This is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a whodunit, and it's enjoyable on that level. The visual effects are spectacular. Will Smith, one of Hollywood's true superstars, works his Will Smith magic, his charm and accessibility on full blast. But his greatest strength may be his ability to humanize his characters. In fact, Del Spooner seems to be one of only two characters here invested with a telling emotional trajectory and with character growth (the other is Sonny). Smith is also equally adept at playing action hero. This is something you can't consistently say about Shia LaBoeuf who has a supporting bit here as a completely irrelevant teen pal of Spooner's. LaBoeuf's presence helps to dumb down the movie. I sort of wish he was exempt fromthe Three Laws of Robotics. I meant the character he plays here, of course...the Three Laws of Robotics. I meant the character he plays here, of course...
B000RZGFZC|5.0|Really. Very Atmospheric. Lyrics and songs have a image like quality to them.  If you ever watched any of those 70's movies like The Devil's Rain etc you almost feel, as if your ears were your eyes, that this is a musical collage or mosaic of various things related to horror movies, world at war videos and anything related to marcabe, destruction and mayhem. This is Slayer at their best and most creative.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Remember back in the day when you were all wistful for Stallone and Schwarzenegger to be in the same movie or, on a subservient level, for Seagal and Van Damme to do something together? FAST FIVE is the best - and biggest - in the Fast & the Furious franchise for any number of reasons, but a big chunk of the hells yeah! stems from the Rock stepping into the series. You knew, you just knew, he and Vin Diesel would be champing at the bit to claim head chair in the pecking order. Adrenalin junkies are accordingly put on alert.<br /><br />FAST FIVE opens by replaying the closing sequence of the previous (and fourth) installment, with Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) being sprung during his transit to penitentiary. This prison - or, more accurately, prison bus - break is masterminded by former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now irrevocably crossed that line. This marks the first time that Walker and Diesel's characters are working on the same side for the entire length of the film. And yet that streak of competitiveness is still there. O'Conner is still earnestly obsessed with proving that he's the superior wheel man. Dom continues to humor him, probably trying not to smirk.<br /><br />Awesomely, FAST FIVE reunites the core cast of the previous four flicks, and I soaked in the cool factor of seeing Tyrese Gibson, Luda, Sung Kang, Don Omar, and Tego Calderon rub elbows with Diesel and Walker. Now fugitives from justice and finding stateside too hot for comfort, Dom, O'Conner, and Mia (Jordana Brewster) have fled to parts unknown. But when a daring Brazilian train caper goes south and ends up with Dom and O'Conner accused of murdering three DEA agents, in comes a relentless U.S. strike force ramrodded by the determined and growly Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). And right away you can feel the ferocity the Rock brings to his role. Oooh, I was anticipating the inevitable butting of heads.<br /><br />But that's just one of the story threads. The central one concerns our likable rogues' planning and orchestrating of one final huge score. Dom and O'Conner have aimed with ambition and with brazenness, targeting the primo drug kingpin in Rio de Janeiro. Except that this Big Bad is one careful, meticulous sumbitch, his stash of $100 million cached in ten holdings spread throughout the city and guarded by an army of corrupt cops on his payroll. The trick is how do you get to all ten stashes without ruining that element of surprise? It's pretty clever how Dom gets around this complication.<br /><br />FAST FIVE does present several good character moments which ground our cast, sort of. I say \\"sort of\\" because, honestly, this franchise's enduring global popularity is built around high-octane, wildly improbable, tremendously entertaining  action sequences (oh, and hot cars and hot chicks in skimpy clothing). But the franchise's stabs at a richer emotional tonality allow the viewer to accept the film's more absurd stunts or at least view them with a more expansive eye. We're treated to three audacious action set pieces (the epic train heist, the chase across the rooftops of a Brazilian slum, the runaway bank vault). We see the brutal, no-holds-barred Rock vs. Diesel fighty fight. We note the film's scorn of the laws of physics. It pays never mind to the logistics involving our heroes surviving a two-hundred-feet plunge into the drink or two cars hauling a bank vault while engaged in a car chase with a troop of police cars. It scoffs at the impossibility of fingerprints being lifted from a bikini. Except that these flaws don't bug me. I only point them out to demonstrate that I'm no wide-eyed daisy. I'm aware of the implausibilities, the ridiculousness of the stuff that goes down, as is director Justin Lin, if you listen to his audio commmentary. This film ain't for nitpickers; it'll be like target practice for them. For my money, FAST FIVE delivers enough solid character interactions, but, no, this isn't a Merchant Ivory production. Instead, it's all about the larger-than-life characters and their dangerous attitudes and it's about the stupendous wall-to-wall action. It's sheer escapism. And, also, maybe you should stick around for the closing credits.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff: Director' Justin Lin's Audio Commentary; 2 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:01:39 minutes); Gag Reel (00:04:17 minutes) and three featurettes focusing, respectively, on Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne Johnson and their character arcs: \\"Dom's Journey\\" (00:04:53 minutes long); \\"Brian O'Conner: From Fed to Con\\" (00:05:53); and \\"Enter Federal Agent Hobbs\\" (00:05:47).s all about the larger-than-life characters and their dangerous attitudes and it's about the stupendous wall-to-wall action.

B0051XZ9GQ|5.0|Watching the news releases of all the new debut recordings of young pianists is leading to building a collection of recitals that it seems is a fine turn of events for the music world.  Still reeling from the recordings of pianists such as Daniil Trifonov and finding what seems to be the Chopin artists of the day, along comes this recording of the brilliant young Austrian pianist Ingolf Wunder and Pow! - the choice broadens.  Wunder's choice of works to present as his debut album mirrors those of many other Chopin experts -Piano Sonata No.3 in B minor, Polonaise-Fantasie No.7 in A flat,  Ballade No.4 in F minor, and Andante spianato and Grande polonaise in E flat.  The difference for this listener is the extremely elegant approach the artist brings to these works.<br /><br />Wunder does not so much impose himself onto these very familiar Chopin works, as is the wont f many others, and for some that may indicate a lack of individuality in playing 'Romantic Chopin'.  But listen to the mellow, inordinately secure Polonaise-Fantasie and imagine Chopin himself playing for you with all the grace and restraint we always hope to hear.  Even the Sonata No. 3  in B minor in Winder's hands and mind becomes less a showcase for pianistic pizazz than a probing account of a work that is one of depth and full of understated splendors.<br /><br />Ingolf Wunder is young, at the beginning of a career and it will be interesting to see the directions he takes. For now, his offering of Chopin is an album that will satisfy everyone.  Grady Harp, October 11

B005MP28B2|5.0|THE TREE OF LIFE is not the usual film - a story that begins, develops, and ends. Yes there is a story here: in a small town (Smithville, Texas) lives a family - a stern, painfully frustrated artist/man who can't seem to succeed in anything for long except raising three boys with his rather quiet passive wife.  One of the boys dies and the remaining family enters into a realm of questioning life, both at the time of the death of the child and years later through the experiences of the oldest boy reflecting on the meaning of life, his response to his father, his sense of continuing loss.  The setting is in the 1950s - that structureless decade following the horrors of WW II, the unleashing of the atomic bomb, the difficulties of making a living and sacrificing dreams for a reality in a way that changes the way individuals interact not only with outsiders but also with the family unit whose only seeming hope of meaning is relying on religious protocol. Yet even religion seems to fail when the inexplicable tragedy of an innocent child's death changes everything. The journey of the film is the maturing of the eldest son as he grows into a man forever challenged by the meaningless of the loss of his brother and the effect that has on his own maturation.<br /><br />The power of the film is in the visual and auditory miracles that unfold on the screen.  Writer/director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line, etc) has gathered images from nature  - incredible rock formations, waterfalls, volcanic eruptions, floating jellyfish, night skies, and light in all its forms, among many others - and allows these images to seep into our minds accompanied by the music of John Tavener, Gustav Mahler, Aresnije Jovanovic, Zbigniew Preiser, Hector Berlioz, Gustav Holst, Bedrich Smetana, Ottorino Respighi, Johannes Brahms, Francois Couperin, Johan Sebastian Bach, Henryk G&oacute;recki, Robert Schumann, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - each work so carefully chosen that the visuals are liberated from the screen to enter our minds.  It is that rare opportunity to watch creation, death, life, and the majesty of nature - none of which is understandable - and that is where the comfort source of this film touches us.<br /><br />The cast is committed and allows the story to enter our heads untainted; Brad Pitt is the father, Jessica Chastain is the mother, young Jack is Hunter McCracken who ages into Sean Penn, Fiona Shaw is the grandmother, and the other boys are played by Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan.  But the real star of this glowing work of art is Terrence Malick.  This film is a masterpiece of cinematic art.  It needs to be seen and experienced.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|Like almost everyone else, I really liked the first three books and had no problem recommending the series.  But after reading half of this book and seeing from the reviews that book five is more of the same I can't do that anymore.  How can I recommend that someone invest that kind of time in a series that will slow to a crawl? I had hoped that this book was an anomaly and that the pace would pick back up in the next book but I can see from the reviews of book five that I was wrong. I have to wonder if the author is trying to milk this series for all he can get from it.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Without Andy Whitfield to play the role of Spartacus in Season 2 in the Starz gladiator hit series, Starz turned their attention to show how Quintus (John Hannah) and his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless) Batiatus turned the House Of Batiatus into the most important Ludus in Capua. Welsh born Australian actor Andy Whitfield brought the Spartacus character in Spartacus: Blood And Sand- The Complete First Season to life in this Starz series. Sadly, Andy was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in March 2010. With immediate treament, Andy came out cancer free in 2 months, only to have it return later. Andy lost the battle with cancer when it returned the second time and he passed away last month on September 11, 2011 at age 39. My deepest sympathy goes out to his surviving wife and 2 children.<br /><br />As Andy went through his cancer treatments, Starz put Season 2 of Spartacus on the back burner and instead created this 6 part history of Quintus and Lucretia Batiatus, Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena. The characters are all here from before Spartacus' arrival in Season 1. Quintus Batiatus (John Hannah), his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), Quintus close friend Solonius (Craig Walsh-Wrightson), Quintus' gladiator instructor (Peter Mensah), the future champion gladiator- Crixus (Manu Bennett) with many of the slaves from Season 1. Turing back the clock to when all of the characters were younger, explains everything about their ambitions in Season 1.<br /><br />In addition, there are some new characters added to the story- Quintus Batiatus' father is ruling the House Of Batiatus in this Gods Of The Arena, and the performance Lucy Lawless gives as the daughter in law is simply superb. Her ambition knows no boundaries. Lucretia (Lawless) has a best friend Gaia (Jaime Murray) who knows that it's who you know to climb the social ladder in Capua and what you can do for them. Lucretia learns a lot from the ambitious Gaia. The star gladiator is a fit, handsome, hard drinking Gannicus played by Dustin Clare. This character is truly fun to watch, and I hope Starz brings him back in a future episode. Crixus is a new gladiator who wants to defeat Gannicus and be the top dog, but all the attention he craves seems to come mainly from Lucretia. This entire prequel showcases the driving ambitions in the House Of Batiatus and is thoroughly worth viewing to get your finger on the pulse of the characters. There are also several other characters in this prequel that add to the growing number of people, that Quintus and Lucretia have to remove to reach their goals.<br /><br />As for Season 2 of Spartacus, Starz has already re-cast 29 year old Australian actor Liam McIntyre as Andy Whitfield's successor. After seeing Season 1 and this prequel, I am looking forward to the continuing action packed saga of Spartacus and the House Of Batiatus.Clare.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|It really does depend on the game and it's tracking needs.    To start off, as other posts have revealed, it works best when below the TV.  The zoom part sometimes confuses the Kinect sensor because the distance is skewed and it throws off the calculations or something.  For instance, with Kinect Adventures as advertised, I am now able to play with two players with the same amount of space.  However, it loses my limbs from time to time and that's not the way to play the game.  Fruit ninja on the other hand, with the zoom on, the sensor is totally off and the game is not playabale.  Whereas with the same space I can play without the sensor for two players.  Good thing it came with that clear plastic sticker to prevent scratching on the sensor.

I'm not sure if it's just me or it is the headset, but after wearing it for a few hours I start to get a pain on my ears. It's because the speaker inside is pressing against my ears the entire time (there's not enough padding). On the bright side, the microphone sounds fantastic. Worth the money, I think.

Very much in the tradition of the Blackstone's Guide Series, the authors, with the assistance of the OUP, cover the latest developments and amendments to the POCA since it came into force in February 2003.  Not only is it ideal for the `embattled practitioner,' it is also a clear, concise introduction to those who are new to this complex area of law, as well as those who, in the words of the authors, must `confront the Act head on in their daily professional lives.  If you find yourself in any of these categories, you need this book.<br /><br />Confronting the POCA `head on' is not exactly an undaunting task.  Its influence and scope are immense, covering everything from stolen cash to money laundering, criminal confiscation and restraint proceedings and the compliance procedures of large companies, as well as, for example, civil recovery of the proceeds of unlawful conduct.<br /><br />Thankfully, the Guide is easy to use.  Each of the logically laid out chapters begins with an overview and a detailed twenty-three page index provides quick access to the information you want.  The four appendices include:  the POCA as amended...the Criminal Procedure Rules 2010 (Parts 56-62 and 71-73)...The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 as amended...and the Practice Direction -- Civil Recovery Proceedings. There are extensive tables of cases and legislation to aid further research.<br /><br />Within its more than 550 pages, this convenient Guide provides all you need in one compact resource.

B002ZG997M|4.0|Convincing sets, good acting, and a surreal world made this an enjoyable experience.  This is one of my first Blu-rays and the crispness of the pictures was wonderful.  Yes, the ending was a little trite and it had Sola Scriptura undertones, but wasn't too forced or proselytic.  While violent, it wasn't terribly explicit.  It did have fairly frequent cursing - which seemed appropriate for those characters.  It had implied non-explicit rapes, but no nudity.  I really thought about this movie for long afterward on several levels, and I'll watch it again.  Oddly, this movie reminded me of a new book I had recently read that also made me think: [[ASIN:1434911667 Eminent Plague]]

0786838655|5.0|Greek Mythology is AWESOME, which makes this book awesome! I had already seen the movie, so I knew I would like the book a lot. I liked it even more than that! I am really excited to see what else is going to happen in this series. I know it is middle grade fiction but it did not feel that way to me. I was interested from start to finish.<br /><br />There are a lot of mythical creatures packed into this book, and I would not want it any other way. Camp Half blood seems like such a cool place too.<br /><br />I really liked Percy, he seems so much older than 12. Maybe that is why the young ages of the characters do not bug me at (like I thought they would) because they all act so much older than they are. They have all had a pretty tough life and have had to grow up fast.<br /><br />Percy sets off on an adventure about 1/3 of the way through the book and that is when it really starts to get good. I loved the amount of mythology \\"facts\\" that were incorporated into the storyline. The nerd in me loved it, I felt like I was getting a greek myth lesson, along with reading about a really cool, high action, adventure.<br /><br />I like how most of the half bloods have characteristics of their god parents. I wish I had read this book before I had seen the movie though so I could have been surprised with some of the twists and turns that happened. That is one of the reasons why I am so excited to reading the rest of the series, because it will all be new to me.<br /><br />Really Great book!<br /><br />-Michelle @ bookbriefs.blogspot.com

Everyone should read them!<br /><br />This book made me cry in numerous places. Suzanne Collins did an incredible job building a world and characters and everything really.<br /><br />I experienced everything along with Katniss. Every emotion, every day. There were times I wanted to scream at what she was going through. And Peeta, don't even get me started with Peeta. I felt so bad for him, it was awful. I love Peeta so much and I just wanted him to become Peeta again. Suzanna Collins knows exactly how to get her readers feeling and thinking.<br /><br />Other books are great; but this trilogy is earth-shattering. I am in love!

1416955070|5.0|Not that the spoilers will matter much, most likely, because I might very well be the last person on the planet to read this series.  I don't know why it took me forever to read this book. I really don't. It was amazing!<br /><br />I love the world that is created in these books is incredible. So interesting, it keeps you reading- you never want to stop.<br /><br />This book introduces shadowhunters, and their role in the world is to hunt demons. But humans (or mundanes) don't know they exist. In this quasi-other world of shadowhunters and demons, there are also downworlders. Creatures that I see as a kind of go-between for the first two. They are things like werewolves and vampires, and they do not get along well with shadowhunters.<br /><br />I really enjoyed all the characters too; Jace is super yummy.<br /><br />I'm really glad that Alec started to come around to Clary by the end of the book, but I do wish the semi-niceness had happened earlier.<br /><br />I have to say, I beyond hate that Clary and Jace are sister and brother. It kind of creeps me out and annoys me. That is my one complaint about the book. I'm going to try and get over it in the future books. But I am loving learning more about their world! Every time a new creature/demon/downworlder is introduced I want hear more on Ms. Clare's take of them. She has such an interesting way of describing anything. She can make a rock sound fascinating.<br /><br />The book was fast paced, and original and the world is addicting.<br /><br />-Michelle @ Bookbriefs.blogspot.com

0439023521|5.0|There are no words to describe this book! No way to capture just how amazing it is.<br /><br />This book is so unlike anything else I have read, it is so powerful and gripping and incredible in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Katniss truly is the girl on fire. She is powerful and strong and a survivor. I admire her so much (even though she can be annoyingly dense at times)<br /><br />This book had me crying, gasping, and gaping in amazement. I could not put it down!<br /><br />Peeta is adorable, and I want to punch Katniss for how dense she is and hurting him at the end. I cannot wait to see how their relationship develops in the next book.<br /><br />This book makes you think, and you get lost in its world. Suzanne collins paints such a detailed picture. I just finished the book and I want to pick it right back up and start it over again. That is how much I am in love with the hunger games.
142311339X|5.0|When I started reading the lost hero I was very pleased. It was exciting and funny with a plot that kept me guessing. The book starts with three demigods Leo, Jason and Piper. Leo has a special power he has vowed never to use since his mom's death. Jason doesn't remember who he is, and Piper has a secret she has the ability to persuade people to do anything she wants .Her dad has also been kidnapped by a cannibal giant. As the story began Jason, Leo and Piper went on a quest to save the queen of the heavens, Hera in five days. Piper has to choose to betray her friends and save her dad, or leave her dad for dead and save Hera. As they go through their quest they find out a mysterious goddess has opened the doors of death and released the worst ancient Greeks like King Midas, Medea and the king of the giants Porphyrion. While reading the book I felt like the book was funny and lively. With Leo always cracking jokes, and there was never a dull moment. I also felt like the book also did a good job of keeping me from putting the book down. There was always something exciting happening, wither they were fighting sun dragons, King Midas or battling giants. I never knew what to expect. I would recommend this book to anyone who loved the Percy Jackson series, and to anyone who's new to the series and wants to read a fun and exciting book. The book was great, but be warned the book has a lot of sacrifice, suffering, hardship, and mystery. Also, if like this book you should also read The Son of Neptune. Percy is back with three new demigods who go on a quest to free the god Thantos from the giant Alcyoneus. The story will also answer your questions about the next great prophecy.
1423101502|5.0|This series was great! I didn't want it to end. But, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was non-stop action from the first page to the last. It was a little longer than the other books, but so much stuff was crammed into it. Nothing was left hanging, which I loved! All of the story lines came together and we finished getting the relevant back story for each of the the demi-gods. I enjoyed taking short breaks from the intense fighting to learn about each of the character's pasts.<br /><br />This book also seemed funnier than the previous books in the series too! I would be reading about crazy battling for a while and then out of no where some cute or funny line would be thrown in to lighten the mood. I loved it! More than once I actually laughed out loud. The balance between intense adventure/battle scenes and lighter moments in the book was really enjoyable.<br /><br />The twist with Rachel was really cool and I liked how she was worked into the storyline. I also loved how the sand dollar came into play. (Poseidon gave it to Percy in the 4th book, and told him to use it when the time was right. Ever since then, I was wondering when it would come up again) I really like it when a little detail can be woven into the story in such an interesting way.<br /><br />The characters in this series are great! It is one thing to have a cool action/adventure story but when dealing with mythology there are so many fantastical creatures and gods that it can be hard to successfully incorporate them all. Rick Riordan did this in such a wonderful way. All his characters, and gods, and monsters were true to myth and seemed to leap off the page for me. They were so vivid, and I also loved that even though there were so many players in this series, none of them felt neglected to me. We learned so much about a ton of them, and I think this series really shone the spotlight and on a bunch of characters! That is not easy to do, so many times a series really only focuses on a few key players and the rest play background roles. I liked that this was not the case in Percy Jackson and the Olympians.<br /><br />Percy is awesome! I love how mature he was throughout the series. (for the most part) And true to mythology, by the end of the book he had taught us all a lesson. (even the gods) I really enjoyed the development his character showed.<br /><br />Another note on the characters- how are all of the myth animals so cute?? Seriously, I am in love with so many of them. Mrs. O'leary is awesome and so loyal! I got really scared a few times in the book that something might happen to her. Plus Bessie was adorable, swimming in her little tank on Olympus. And blackjack, the Pegasus. I want them all!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVED this book, and the series! Anyone that likes mythology will love these books. They are so true to the excitement and adventure and fantasy that encompasses Greek mythology and they are a fun read that I truly enjoyed!<br /><br />-Michelle @ bookbriefs.blogspot.comund roles.

B005HXGEDC|4.0|In many cases musicians release live albums to buy time for a new studio release, to publicize their back catalogue or they've just run out of creative juice.  In some rare instances a musician puts out a live album because they're reworking or refashioning well-known songs or trying to re-invent themselves musically.  \\"New Blood\\" falls somewhere between the two with Peter Gabriel giving some of his lesser-known 80's era songs a fuller orchestral treatment, somewhat akin to what Sting did with 2010's [[ASIN:B003LAH7MU Symphonicities]].  Gabriel's thought was to provide different insight into the songs than was the case with the originals.  Fair enough.<br /><br />\\"New Blood\\" skews heavily towards tracks from 1982's [[ASIN:B003ZZAXG8 Peter Gabriel 4: Security]] and 1986's [[ASIN:B000000OPU So]] largely eschewing hits (aside from \\"In Your Eyes,\\" \\"Red Rain,\\" and \\"Digging in the Dirt\\") in favor of deep cuts from two of his most commercially successful albums.  Again, fair enough, as it's a different approach and not your usual \\"just the hits please\\" approach for live albums.  The results are certainly different from the originals and it's subjective to say if they're improvements or not.  Fans of the sparse brittle tension of [[ASIN:B003ZZAXFO Peter Gabriel 3: Melt]] and [[ASIN:B003ZZAXG8 Peter Gabriel 4: Security]] will undoubtedly be discomfited by the lush fuller arrangements here.  Formerly unsettling tracks like \\"Intruder\\" feel like they've lost a bit of their edge when compared to the originals and sometimes there is a tendency to ask \\"is this really necessary?\\"  The latest trend in musicians of \\"a certain age\\" is to perform concerts that showcase a specific album or albums, and \\"New Blood\\" teeters dangerously close to doing that.  Granted, it's not a precise recreation but a revamping, but the thought still registers in the back of the listeners' mind, especially when most of the material showcased here is 20+ years old.  Considering his last studio release was 2003's [[ASIN:B00006F7S3 Up]] all of the forgoing questions and doubts tend to crop up.  That's not to say that \\"New Blood\\" isn't enjoyable.  It is, but it's certainly not going to win new fans and seems geared more towards longtime followers.  It's also answering a question nobody seems to be asking.  As a huge fan of 80's era Peter Gabriel I've never wondered \\"I wonder what orchestral versions would sound like?\\"  Rather than cheering Peter boldly moving forward \\"New Blood\\" is a look back for reasons never really fully fathomed.IN:B00006F7S3 Up]] all of the forgoing questions and doubts tend to crop up.

0439023491|5.0|This is the second book in the dystopian series The Hunger Games. I COULD NOT put this book down! And trust me, I tried. Im sick and I have a major assignment due in Law school, and still I could not manage to do anything except read this book. It was that good!<br /><br />*there will be spoilers* if you have not read this trilogy though, go do it. Right now, don't even bother to turn your computer off. Just run to the nearest store/library/e-reader and start reading! You will not regret it!<br /><br />Seriously I wish I had read this series when it first came out so I could re-read it over and over again.<br /><br />I did not expect for them to go back into the hunger games!(in the quarter quell) That was a big twist for me.<br /><br />As creepy and disturbing as the actual hunger games are, the arenas kind of fascinate me. The amount of time and things that are put into them is crazy! i'm more than a little in love with Peeta, and Katniss too! I really liked the development between them in this book. Peeta is way smarter than I was initially giving him credit for, the whole baby thing was genius.<br /><br />I have nothing bad to say about this book. Except that I wish there was more than one book left...
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Love these Reacher novels. I've read all of them, and I think this is the first in which Reacher turns totally murderous -- and it's placed before the other books in time, so that's a sign the author wants us to think of Reacher as a stone-cold murderer from the beginning.  He murders three people in this book. Two of them are smart-ass murderers themselves, one of the two a serial killer. The third person is an annoying amoral politician who is not a killer, and has only helped a killer out of a mix of love and ambition.   Luckily I remembered that this detective/murderer business has been going on since at least the Philo Vance stories of the twenties, and that Sherlock Holmes let a thief or two go in his time. And of course there was Mickey Spillane. Still, I got a little queasy at this new, more murderous Reacher. He was always a little bit of a bully, but in this book he sets up some sex so he can orgasm as the bodies of his victims are torn apart.   Isn't that a touch too cruel?
1423101499|5.0|*There will be spoilers*<br /><br />This book is my favorite in the series so far! It was non-stop action from start to finish, and all of it was great. I devoured this book so fast! The series is really coming together, and I am sad that there is only one book left.<br /><br />I really like how you find out the prophecy for each of the quests early on in the story, but it never ruins too much for you. Most of the time there are enough twists/new developments that the prophesy ends up not being what you first imagined. Rick Riordan did a great job of planning everything out, and he has put together such a great and complete, detailed series.<br /><br />The idea of the labyrinth spreading across the entire United States is awesome! I love the detail that went into it. I also found the Sphinx(which is just one of the crazy creatures found in the maze) to be hilarious! I loved that instead of her customary riddles, she has been reduced to asking fact based questions and then the answers get fed into a scan-tron machine! And when Percy and company leave her, she is moaning about having to grade the tests by hand now. Too funny!<br /><br />I loved how this series, is part mythology, part adventure, and part mystery almost. I love seeing the characters piece together the clues and figure out what they have to do next; where they have to go, or how they have to defeat a certain monster. It is a very engaging read!<br /><br />Annabeth's jealousy was not too endearing for me, though. I felt bad that Percy had to put up with her standoffish-ness. I was so frustrated with her at the end, with the way she ended things with Percy.<br /><br />Rachel was interesting, I still want Annabeth but Rachel seems so nice. I don't want her to get hurt either, however; she seems like a smart girl so I'm sure she is not oblivious to the situation between Percy and Annabeth.<br /><br />I am loving how everything is coming together and the last book seems like it will be one huge, epic battle! I cannot wait to read it!<br /><br />-Michelle @ bookbriefs.blogspot.com
B0010SEN18|2.0|As Scott Kelby recommended this book and most of the reviews were good, I bought this book. It was not what I thought. I don't recommend it if you are buying it to learn how the photos were taken. He talks about how he set them up but did not include anything about any camera settings. That would have been good.
B005IS565S|5.0|American Capitalist is hands down awesome.  Got the deluxe edition and it is totally worth every penny.  FFDP did not lose their touch, the songs are still wicked and I can listen to the CD from start to end without stopping.  The four bonus songs were sick.  My favorite of the bonus songs was the Under and Over It remix.  Overall my favorite song of the new album is 100 Ways to Hate.  Amazing job FFDP on American Capitalist.
B003Y5H574|2.0|Pathetic american stereotypical BS without a meaning. A movie for people 50+ at least. Nothing unexpected there. I dont hold anything against movies with a happy ending but the end of this movie is so horribly cheesy, unapproached. Not even a nuclear mushroom cloud could have disturbed the overwhelming sunshine, love and hapiness without a reason at the end. And not only the end. The womanizer, who becomes the good seriously loving guy; the cheating, depressed housewife, who finally realizes its better to be back at the old bump and grind instead of experiencing the uncertain. Give me a break! And finally, he was better at \\" The Office\\". Summary: Not worth seeing. If you wanna know which movies to watch, here's a list:  Fight Club, 25 hours, Limitless, Heat and of course Hang Over I and II  And for all the ones, that cant live without heartsy fartsy movies: \\"Friends with benefits\\"....one of the better ones  So long folks and thanks for all the fish

B000EHRVP6|4.0|As the Soviet Union collapsed in the 90's, everything they had went on sale.  This movie depicts an aspect of murder/psychopathy/sociopathology for a price.  The movie is chilling in it's presentation and casts a light on the darkest side of human activities.  As such, hide this DVD from the children.  The attempt to make money from the subsequent spin-off films had the usual results, namely a waste of time.
B000784WMW|5.0|All i can say is i love this movie. So happy to have a copy to call my own.  Service was great, arrived on time, no problems
B00005UWMX|5.0|Ladyhawke is a darling fantasy adventure that shows off the striking features of Michelle Pfeiffer, the humor of Matthew Broderick, and Rutger Hauer's penchant for playing stoic and vengeful characters. Not to mention some incredible scenery and animals.  But let's face it. The Region 1 (United States/Canada) DVD stinks. It's on a tiny screen even if you happen to have a big screen (they call THAT \\"letterbox\\"?!) and the quality isn't much better than on a VHS tape. Those aforementioned striking features and incredible scenery? They're not striking and incredible any more. However, the company that made this DVD (Warner Home Video) didn't make the non-US versions, thankfully, so if you want to see this movie as it should be seen--in anamorphic widescreen with the same aspect ratio as shown in the theaters--get another version. You have several choices:  * Buy the Region 2 DVD. 20th Century Fox did a great job on the transfer. The guards' uniforms are really red again, and the sunrises and sunsets are phenomenal! The down side is that you have to either have a region-free player or a way to make DVD and player play nicely together.  * Buy the region-free Blu-ray. I haven't seen this and so can't compare. It appears that Fox produced this one also, so there's hope that it's been done well. It may become the best and easiest choice for North Americans . . . once it's available for sale more widely.  * Watch on Amazon Instant Video. I compared this to the Region 2 version, and it appears to be the same aspect ratio, using the full width of the screen, so it's a definite improvement over the Region 1 DVD. However, the colors aren't nearly as vivid as the Region 2, and the night scenes are harder to see. It's also blurrier, which makes sense since it would be hard for a streaming version to have the same resolution.  Warner Home Video did such a lousy job on this DVD that it was hard for my family to watch and enjoy. I'm so glad that viewers have other, better options.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|After searching for a solution to the audio problems with my tv, I found just what I was looking for.  I had been told in other stores there was nothing that would work for me, but this was the answer.  The reviews I read convinced me to order it and I am very satisfied.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Overall, this set looks very good.  The best Star Wars has ever looked.  There are a few places where a new transfer using the most current technology would have improved the set and it is a little disappointing that they didn't do this.  I have to assume the cost of re-working the newly added CGI to an all new transfer and restoration of the original source material was prohibitive (i.e. there weren't enough people who cared by withholding their wallets to make it worthwhile). I must admit that with the (mostly) great looking picture and the excellent uncompressed audio, I did feel for a moment like a kid watching this for the first time again.  Even the prequels, possibly since they can be watched in a more relaxed manner free from the weight of their original anticipation, seemed to work much better for me.  Not perfect but well worth buying.
1612930425|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic of English literature for good reason. The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.<br /><br />The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.<br /><br />Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com
B004SBQAN8|4.0|The suspense is good. It kept me asking myself what was going to happen next.  The special effects and the action are exciting and interesting.  The last fighting scene in the school has a surprise. I did not anticipate it.  Generally speaking, the acting is engaging. However, the acting of Alex Pettyfer's sidekick is not convincing.  I had the opportunity to read the book a couple of days before watching this movie. I think the film is better. The reason is ninety percent of the book is dialogues. They can't express the action and suspense as good as  the film.   Overall, the picture is entertaining. I own a copy of it.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|Let me start by saying that I enjoy art movies.  I don't mind symbolism.  I don't mind having to read into things a little bit.  That being said, this movie wasn't the worst thing I have ever seen by any means.  It felt like the movie was created by the director / writer for himself for his own enjoyment.  The story in itself is a good story.  You really begin to feel for the characters and for people like myself, begin to relate to the things Jack and his brothers go through.  The mother's love and the father's forceful nature come across very strong and Jack's \\"whispers to the Creator\\" throughout the movie add a great element of the way most kids question the things around them and why they do what they do.  All in all, this movie could have been cut to around an hour and a half long.  We get to look into the creation of the universe and evolution and dinosaurs.  Not necessary by any means.  Cool to watch but COMPLETELY out of context.  The ending was confusing as well, and maybe I'm just slow, but after two hours and fifteen minutes, I still wasn't sure which brother had passed away.  Imagine if David Lynch (Eraserhead, Lost Highway) decided to make a film about creation.  This is that film.  Again, I enjoyed the core story, but the rest I could have done without, and the fact that the director makes us sit through a Discovery Channel documentary for the first 30 minutes of the movie is reason enough to pass this one up. It struck a cord with me because of my upbringing and childhood but my flaws were the only thing that saved this movie for me.  But if you enjoy imagery and symbolism and spending an hour or two on the internet after watching the movie reading about what you just watched, then this is the movie for you!

B005DZMP00|5.0|For all the people complaining about the packaging...get over it.  Amazon is offering a spectacular 2 disc Grateful Dead album from one of their greatest years and only charging $9.99, shipping it for free to your house and you find something as piddly as this to complain about??  I feel sorry for you.  This album is just a perfect companion to the first volume!  The song selection is top notch and the playing on every song is just plain full of energy and inspiration.  While many may point to the Dark Star from disc two as a high point, I have to say that the entirety of disc one is what brought out the goosebumps and raised the hair on my arms.  Pigpen is especially highlighted with great versions of Chinatown Shuffle and Next Time You See Me.  Greatest Story Ever told is played as intensely as I've ever heard it and left me shaking my head with disbelief at how blessed we all were to experience this great band in our lifetimes.    Five stars, hands down....lets bring on volume 3!!

B005IS565S|5.0|Again, 5FDP puts out another amazing album. The difference with this album compared to their first two, is that you can tell they've grown up a bit. They still have that more than recognisable 5FDP sound, but with this album, they could probably play more than half of the songs on the radio. Some people could say that, that could be a bad thing. I don't think so. I think that they bring something new to the table. Something that people are ready for. This album will bring them further than they probably have ever expected.<br />I'm proud to say that I've been with them since their first album, The Way Of The Fist,  and will be behind them, supporting them, 150% with this album and the others that will follow.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Well . How to start a short , concise summary ? Musically , you either hate Floyd or love 'em . I fall into the latter group and was eagerly waiting for this release and 5.1 mixes etc . The audio side and the Blu Ray are all impressive ......BUT ! Here's the big BUT , that seems to dominate this review page . The presentation and the extras' . Worth it ? A resounding NO ! Everything about this box set screams CHEAP from EMI . If i was the members of Floyd i would want a little chat with the execs who approved this . Cardboard sleeves for two of the disc's , just free floating in the box . The marbles and the tatty scarf ? JUNK ! Two booklets that also look cheap and cobbled together . Replica tickets and coasters ? CRAP ! I would , if they even read or listen to fans anyway , recommend that these execs and EMI toads go look at KScope , Burning Shed and Steven Wilson as to how to produce an exquisite box set that costs less and is far , far , far superior . I will be cancelling my \\"immersion\\" WYWH now , and will simply order the discs . I recommend you do the same .
B001R3YRFS|5.0|This is for sure a Michael Douglas and Joel Schumacher classic.

B00000ITOY|5.0|This is the best puzzle I feel is on the market today. Its timeless color scheme and manipulation literally helps the brain develop. Remember this is a 'simple toy' BUT not simple to use. My one year old really does well with this toy. It has been dropped numerous times, its in our large toy box and it has managed to stay like new. Granted I wouldn't recommend purposely dropping it but this is very durable. My little one has developed well as this really works hand eye coordination. Also it has taught my little one to count and to learn shapes and colors. For example we count the pegs and match them with the same number of holes in the proper shapes. Also we are starting to learn matching and sorting such as making each stack in the same color order. Its a lot of fun and we easily play with it for a good 20 mins or longer almost every day. You will really need to sit down with your little ones with this though. Unlike other puzzles where you can just let them learn on their own this is one that you will need to explain and work with them. Have fun! Oh if you keep the box it stores well in it in a toy box. :
B000GFLKF8|2.0|I really could not take anything out of this movie.  The middle of the film was quite suspenseful but the ending was strange I thought, almost like there was going to be a part 2.  Think I had seen that somewhere that there was going to be a part 2.  A better ending could have changed my opinion since I feel an ending came make or break a movie.  For the casual D. Washington, fan look at training day or john q instead.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0044RFT8S|3.0|My son likes this movie, but I ordered the DVD/BluRay combo and in the package there were two DVDs, no BluRay. I did not open the package for over a month after I got it, so I didn't realize this until recently. Disappointed that I do not have the BluRay, but it's a good movie for kids, and I don't mind listening to it in the car. The shipment came very quickly and everything came undamaged.
B000F9RB94|2.0|The movie starts kind of slow and then once over half way through the film you finally get to what it was supposed to be about, protecting a criminal who will offer lots of money to anyone who can save him.  If I can recall correctly, the first half of the movie has nothing to do with this.  Disappointed with it since was hoping for more I guess with the movie getting a lot of attention on either Cinemax or HBO where it's played often.  Then the ending I thought was kind of strange as well.  Nonetheless, it could satisfy the average action buff.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great price on the complete Star Wars saga. Finally on blu-ray and couldn't be any better. Love the extras and that I could get all 6 in one set!!
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a pretty good movie and now 10 years might still be a classic.  It is played on many cable channels all the time, but buy or rent it to get the uncut version.(Exception HBO or Cinemax) It will really open your eyes to a different form of justice for a cop that really does not go bad, but takes his arrests to a new level of personal enforcement.  Denzel Washington's character is not necessarily the bad guy but uses very risky tactics to perform his job where no one will tell him differently.  There are many great scenes in this film but the one with Snoop Dog is one of my favorites.  It will be interesting to see the new roles Washington takes up in the future but would be hard to top this one.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
006113399X|1.0|[[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast: A Harry Hole Novel]]  This book needs an editor.  Rambling, digressing, poorly crafting off-point red herrings (whatever IS the opening chapter there for?), this writer meanders through a miasma of events characterized primarily by those devices a good writing teacher tells you to get rid of - the ones about which inexperienced writers are inclined to congratulate themselves for their brilliance and which this reader finds irritatingly \\"clever.\\"  No matter how hard I tried to \\"get\\" him, Harry Hole is so unsympathetically uninteresting and poorly motivated the Nazis become the more compelling focus for reader identification.  Really.  I had been looking forward to it, was reading it for my great book club.  Oops.  Dud.  A \\"psychological\\" \\"thriller\\" without either  psychology or thrills.  The comparisons to Stieg Larsson are insulting to skillful readers, appreciators of the \\"genre\\" (which genre is it, exactly, again?).  If you did a google search for the plot points and thematic devices of a dozen or so other better writers and mashed them all together into an imitative hodgepodge you'd have ... well ... a Redbreast.  I was going to say I liked the cross-cutting between war scenes and present time, until my fellow reader called to complain about how poorly she thought that was done. Well, I did like it.  And I did come away with a much increased appreciation of the ... no, wait.  I was going to say I came away with an appreciation of the Nazi point of view, but... Not really.  The friend who recommended it loves to read \\"good brain candy.\\"  This one left me feeling like I did the day after Halloween when I'd eaten so much junk I couldn't remember if any of it was enjoyable at the time.  A million calories, no satisfaction.
0439023491|4.0|I started reading Catching Fire almost immediately after finishing The Hunger Games. The first novel left me wanting to find out more about the history of this world, how it came about, and what would happen to the characters after the end of the games.<br /><br />The story picks up months later, where very little has changed. It seems that the relationships between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale have all been kept on 'hold' in the time since the Games, and very little has progressed. A lot of time is spent reintroducing Katniss and district 12 as well as her new place as a victorious Tribute.<br /><br />Admittedly, the book starts off almost agonizingly slow. There is a bit of intrigue with the threat of the Capital, and the outbursts at the various stops the characters make along the way. As with the first book, it left me wishing the author gave more detail to the other districts, as I felt it would have better fleshed out the world and the struggles that each district faced. By the time the 'big announcement' is made, I'll admit that I was looking forward to getting back into the Arena.<br /><br />Things are not quite as they seem, though. There is so much going on in the background of this novel, hinted at, but not actually brought to light. The relationships of the characters in the Arena aren't as deep as they were in the previous novel, but the intrigue of the Capital vs. the districts kept me still rooting for the characters. The Arena itself was much more engaging, and I found the whole idea fascinating. There are more creatures, and more struggles to face, each one showing just how far the Capital really would sink to get their revenge on those who would dare stand up against them.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those book series I've seen people mention for a long time. Since I was looking for something new, I decided to pick up the first book, and was not disappointed. The book is set in a beautifully elaborate dystopian world where the districts (which produce various products) are ruled over by the iron first of 'The Capital'. It is all too easy to slip into this harsh world, and feel for the characters struggling in it.   The story starts off a bit slow, which is where the characters really keep you interested. The build up to the Hunger Games themselves (which don't happen until halfway through the novel) doesn't manage to drag too much, and most of the 'stops' that the tributes make along the way end up all having some nice character interaction and development. There is a stark contrast between the two worlds of the districts and the Capital that help to show that the children sent to fight are no more than sheep for the slaughter.  When the games really begin, though, that is when the book shines. Suspicion, tactics, alliances, love, loss... The Hunger Games has so many levels of different emotions that play out in the conflict to stay alive. The only real downside I'll admit is that I would have liked a bit more focus on some of the other tributes from the other districts. Many of them are just faceless entities, so it's hard to get as much feeling over their loss.   Overall, a good read, a fantastic world, and a book that left me intrigued to find out what else would happen once the games have ended.

0439023513|3.0|The first and second books of the Hunger Games series left me enthralled in a world of intrigue. Catching Fire set up what should have been an exiting conclusion. However, I feel that Mockingjay fell a bit flat of that expectation.  Katniss, a character who had largely been portrayed as a strong, capable girl, ends up seemingly re-written as a weak girl who prefers to run off and hide in closets and dark places rather than face the world around her. She spends most of the book either hiding, injured, or unconscious, to the point where I started asking myself... 'Wait, is she knocked out /again/?'  Without Katniss's strength to drive the story, it dragged at many points. The militaristic district she calls 'home' comes across just as despicable in many ways as the Capital that they are supposed to be standing up against. Gale becomes increasingly dislikable, both in his attitudes about the war and in his way of of treating Katniss. Not only that, but the redeeming qualities of Peeta get nearly completely wiped out by the events of the story, leaving few characters who you really 'feel' for by the end.  When the 'action' finally does pick up, it feels a too-little-too-late. The creatures, traps, and unexpected turns that happen in the final battle against the Capital seem to build up for a big showdown that never happens. Instead, we're left with an injured/unconscious heroine (/again/) and little real resolution. Even the last 'big event' of the novel seems to happen too fast, and peters off without any real explanation to the consequences and outcomes of Katniss's final decision.  Even in the epilogue, I was left feeling as if the characters and their relationships were just stuck back together with a bit of duct tape and the author hoped we wouldn't notice. All in all, I found this a disappointing end to a good series.

It touched me profounly and changed the way that I saw the world and the conflicts between people.<br /><br />It looks like both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions have been spruced up a bit with brighter colours and a sharper image.

My favorites are \\"The Morrow\\", \\"The One Moment\\", \\"The Arrival\\", \\"The Other Side\\", and \\"The Departure\\". This is classical music, which makes it excellent for chilling or concentrating. It comes in a standard clear jewel case and is formatted as an audio CD so it will play even in older CD players that do not support MP3 CDs. Furthermore, the fact that it is formatted as CD audio means that the audio itself is high quality and will sound fantastic even when ripped to a compressed format like MP3. The disc itself looks elegant - nothing extravagant, but something that will look good with any collection. The music itself is sublime, but why take my word for it? Get this soundtrack and experience it for yourself!
0142419400|5.0|Anna and The French Kiss is a book that I have heard so much about. Everyone seems to love the novel and I have been recommended this book by so many people I have lost count. Many times when a book has so much hype surrounding it, I find that it is never able to live up to it and I end up disappointed., so, I put this book off until I could not take it anymore! Let me tell you this book did everything but disappoint.<br /><br />Anna is sent to Paris to attend boarding school, which she is less than thrilled about. She loves her life in her hometown of Atlanta with her best friend and her almost-boyfriend. Anna feels lonely and an outcast in Paris, that is until she meets St Clair, an irresistible guy with a cute English accent. There's just one problem St Clair is already taken and in a relationship with his long term girlfriend.<br /><br />I'm unsure where to even begin with how much I love Anna and The French Kiss. This novel had everything I love to read about filling the pages. I picked this up and  could not put it down, it literally had to be dragged out of my hand at one point just so I could go to sleep. This is such a beautifully written contemporary YA novel, I was swept away with the pages and Stephanie Perkin's writing style. I loved the setting of Paris for this novel, it was almost like a character in itself. The description was so well done that at times I felt as though I really was in Paris along with Anna and her friends. I love Paris, so any novel that can transport me there within the pages gets major bonus points from me.<br /><br />I loved Anna as a character, finding her to be so relatable. She is awkward yet surprisingly likeable at the same time. Many girls will be able to relate to her, and the feelings she has during her time in Paris, because she is just your average girl. She is also very intelligent, which I loved about her, as it shows girls can do well in school and still be interested in boys at the same time. She is hilarious yet far from perfect which makes her seem much more real as a character. I also fell in love with St Clair (Etienne), again for his flaws and imperfections. He is just a normal guy and does not pretend to be anything that he is not. Even though Anna and St Clair, are my favourite characters, all of the characters with in the novel are beautifully written and memorable in their own ways.<br /><br />There was one thing above all else that I loved about Anna and The French Kiss and that was the romance. I felt as though Stephanie Perkins created the romance between Anna and St Clair perfectly. I truly believed in their feelings for one another and their relationship throughout the novel, without any sense of doubt at all. I was willing the two to get together the whole way through the novel. I just wish they had been able to show their true feelings to each other sooner. I believe that the romance was so good because it was built up and not rushed into, it was built on a friendship and that is what makes me swoon over it so much. I want a relationship like theirs!<br /><br />I honestly do not think I have loved a novel as much as I love Anna and The French Kiss. I want to read this all over again, right now! It is such a cute, beautiful, feel good novel which will grip hold of you and not let go until long after you have finished the last page. Anna and The French Kiss is like a hot, frothy, comforting hot chocolate that you will want to curl up with and savour for hours.<br /><br />Georgina<br />Chick Litaholicher seem much more real as a character.

B005K2KCPG|4.0|This is an interesting album.  In my opinion, a refined version of the previous album.  If you are purchasing this album to hear Sammy/Mike VH or Joe the technician in solo you won't find it.  This is a new band, a new concept by impassioned musicians.  Chickenfoot iii is a studio creation perfection unlike the prior album where the band comes together as a group rather than efforts of individual musicians.    Listened to without comparison of previous work by any musician, this album is outstanding.  Each musician has their own trademarks.  They are brought together seamlessly in this album.    I remember Sammy saying at a VH concert how hard it was to be screaming in concert all the time.  In this album, he sings without screaming and uses his loud voice for pushing parts of the lyrics.    A critic said none of the music 'sticks'.  A new music composer once said that young people like repetition in there music, it makes the music memorable - makes me think they are ADHD.  No massive repetition here - Sammy tells his stories in his lyrics.  Chickenfoot repetition comes from playing the album again and again.   A true reinvention of themselves...  enjoy.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Oops, wrong movie, but the sentiment applies. Lucas needs to let his films go the same way Indy needed to let the Grail go. His unstoppable meddling is making them worse and worse. I hated the prequels and it seems all the new changes are doing is tying the old films to them but that's like tying yourself to a STD-riddled dead hooker. If George wants some films to change, he should be changing the ones that are widely considered terrible. Making Episodes I-III less stupid is certainly a lot harder than making the original saga more stupid but if he wants to impress...  I first appreciated certain changes Lucas wanted to make with the Special Editions... sure, clean that ugly blur out from under the land speeder and feel free to better define the 80's compositing, even add in a snake thing to the sarlaac to make it more interesting. These little changes were improvements in my eyes but they came with a horrendous looking Jabba the Hutt having a redundant conversation with Han, a very effeminate Jawa swinging from his brontosaur-elephant hybrid, a giggling little droid who gets smacked out of the air by a big bully droid, and a painful music video sequence with cartoonish characters screaming directly into the camera, pretty much breaking the delicate fourth wall.   These little annoyances ushered in the spirit of the prequels. They were there to appeal to kids, because apparently Lucas knows what kids like and he's decided that it is retarded, flamboyant creatures, cartoony CGIs, kindergarten dialogue, and mindless action. Also throw in a triple amputee catching fire and screaming in rage as his flesh melts off.   The new changes follow suit, including the disgusting Vader \\"Noooooo\\" and some horribly generated creature that looks like that creature who raced that stupid kid from \\"Jingle All The Way\\" in Episode I. Ahhh, yet another tie in to Lucas' miserable prequel films. Just stop old man. Let someone competent completely remake the prequels and restore the old films to their original loveable glory. The thing is, George, kids loved them as they were, why do you think they were such a success?
B0050XFY4O|4.0|THE REACTION  I don't understand why mutually consenting sex - actually eager sex, in this case - between brothers near the same age is a big deal. It's not as if they would produce deformed offspring. That particular taboo makes no sense to me. I suppose people believe it's bad just because everybody else does and they've never bothered to ask themselves, Why?  I'm not advocating gay incest, not trying to force it on anybody, any more than I would try to force ANYTHING on anybody; but the nearly universal horror at the idea of sex between brothers - even in a movie, and even among large numbers of gay men - mystifies me.  I have never been the least bit attracted to my own brother, even though I love him a lot; but two brothers' falling in love in a movie does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. I don't feel compelled to try to twist it into something else that's more acceptable.  People who have said that it's easy to forget that Francisco and Thomás are brothers in the latter half of the movie must really be trying HARD to forget it, because the movie never stops affirming the fact that that's what they are. Fighting that battle while trying to enjoy a movie must detract a lot from the enjoyment.  WHAT'S WRONG  This is a flawed but very interesting and unusual movie, and I can understand why even the many positive reviews it gets have trouble describing it.  It has been called a fairy tale because Francisco and Thomás seem to live in a dream world as cut off from the real world as Sleeping Beauty in her castle. But aren't all young lovers like that? Isn't that what love and hormones do to young bodies and young minds? Doesn't the rest of the world tend to fall away when the beloved comes into view? That's how it was when I was young.  So to say that this movie is a fairly tale is simply to say that it is a love story. It's an unusual love story, but fundamentally it is just like any other love story in any romance movie since movies began. If anything, itsdepiction of the all-consuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are, not less.  Others have emphasized the parents' evident oblivion or even acquiescence to what is going on under their noses, but that seems to me like just another symptom of the irrational taboo I mentioned earlier. It's like: \\"What those boys are doing is WRONG! Why don't their parents stop it?\\" But, again, I ask: Why? Who is hurting whom? Nobody that I can see.  When they're children, they simply love each other and love to be together, and they are freely affectionate with each other. Is that bad? Why? Should the mother slap her son when he kisses his younger brother on the head or puts his arm around him or holds him while they sleep? Why? Is fighting better? Is sibling rivalry better than sibling affection? Evidently it is to many people.  Neither of those is what I see as a weakness in this movie. It is true that the movie is unreal, but what seems most unreal to me is not the brothers' relationship with each other or even with their parents. That's just an extraordinarily loving and mutually accepting family, which is almost never seen in a movie or in real life but should be everybody's ideal of what a family ought to be. If that's not the unconditional love people rave about nowadays, I don't know what is.  What seems most unreal to me is the other adults' relationships with each other, the fantastically loving relationships between exes and in-laws and friends who are NOT in love with each other, who are NOT caught up in the heady ecstasy of hormones and young love. That excess of affection is just plain weird.  Another weakness I see is in the dialog. The core story about the relationship between the brothers is fine - it's a love story - but what people say to each other is stilted and awkward, not at all the way real people talk. It's almost like the way people talk in TV commercials. And the problem is not just in the English subtitles, which actually are verygood: what they're saying in Portuguese sounds just as phony.  And the final weakness I see is in the direction. The director seems to be trying to make something besides JUST a love story, but what that other something is never comes clear. It feels as if he is intentionally trying to make it an allegory, or an epic myth, or a pantomime, or a ballet, or something else abstract that wrestles constantly with the extremely simple love story which the movie actually is.  The odd scene in which the adult brothers slowly undress for the first time as they face each other across the room is particularly strange, like something out of a kabuki performance. That obscure tension between what the movie is and what the director is trying to make it be doesn't ruin the movie, but it IS distracting.  WHAT'S RIGHT  All four actors who play the two brothers as children and then as adults are very good and very beautiful, inside at least as much as outside. What the director did an EXCELLENT job of is getting straight actors (which I assume they all are) to be so convincingly loving toward each other. Every affectionate gesture, every touch, every loving look is believable and totally convincing. That could NEVER happen in an American or Canadian movie, or even in a European movie, and I've never seen it in any other movie from Latin America. It is a unique and astonishing accomplishment.  The director also gets credit for the movie's other great accomplishment, which is simply that it got made. A movie about love, passion, unshakable devotion, loyalty, innocence, tenderness and limitless generosity between two men is rarer than hens' teeth. The scene in which they exchange wedding rings alone together at home is one of the sweetest, sexiest scenes I have ever seen. I have never seen any other movie that even comes close to the love between these two men, and I have seen hundreds and hundreds of gay movies. This is far from the best of them, but it is the most wonderful.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this quite awhile ago, so rating today is based upon the fact that it has stayed with me in a lot of ways. Not forgettable.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Movie-wise, Citizen Kane is quite the classic. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written on a level that is only comparable to Shakespeare. Like all timeless classics, age has not withered its potency, and 70 years later it is as relevant as ever and absolutely just as moving as it no doubt was back in 1941.<br /><br />Blu Ray-wise, it's even better. Movies this old should not look this good. It just doesn't seem right, and yet, here it is - presented absolutely perfectly without the tiniest flicker or grain, in stunning STUNNING 1080p that gives incredible details to old coats, snow flurries, mansions, facial expressions.. and, well, every single shot. It's glossy all the way throughout. This is NOT a low budget restoration, it's a transformation like no generation has yet to experience. If you think Blu Ray can only enhance modern, color spectacles, watch this movie. You will be proven wrong. In fact, some of my all-time favorite blu rays to show off my 1080p television are Black and White. [[ASIN:B000Q6GX8Q Casablanca [BLU-RAY]]] and [[ASIN:B003JBI3GA The Twilight Zone [Blu-ray]]] are just some examples that dazzle a high definition screen. Citizen Kane is among the best, if not THE best, however, and has set the bar even higher. I'm so happy that this release was taken seriously.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you're a fan of this classic or have never seen it before, buy or rent this movie on blu ray. Relive it again as you've never experienced it before, or watch it for the first time and be prepared to be amazed. Either way, I urge you to take advantage of this new HD technology. Movies, especially old movies, will never be the same.<br /><br />~~Rosebud~~
B00466HN86|5.0|I had the opportunity to watch this movie with some family friends and haven't stopped talking about it since! There wasn't a dry eye in the entire theatre, you can't help but be touched. Not only does this movie touch parent's hearts, but it also impacts the young adults, the next generation. Once you see it you can't help but tell others to see it too. Impacting, God honoring, amazing! With each movie Sherwood Baptist has moved forward, their movies keep getting better!
B005LY3VRO|4.0|Hardcore Britney fans will no doubt be disappointed to see that, with the exception of the new Criminal remix, all the other remixes on this CD have been released somewhere previously.  That doesn't necessarily make it a bad collection, however. Most fans aren't the type to buy every single and download every remix, so for the casual dance music lover, this is a great way to listen to a \\"greatest hits\\" of Brit's ferocious club hits in the past few years.<br /><br />Here's my breakdown of the hits and misses:<br /><br />THE HOT AND STEAMY<br />- Piece of Me (Tiesto Club Mix)<br />- Till the World Ends (Alex Suarez Club Remix)<br />- Gimme More (Kaskade Club Mix)<br />- 3 (Manhattan Clique Club Remix)<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />- I Wanna Go (Gareth Emery Remix) [I would have preferred the Wallpaper mix]<br />- Criminal (Radio Mix) [though it doesn't change the original much, this new version really transforms the song for me. I Love it!]<br />- If U Seek Amy (U-Tern Remix)<br />- Womanizer (Benny Benassi Extended Mix)<br /><br />THE EH<br />- Circus (Linus Loves Remix) [way better remixes to choose from]<br />- Radar (Tonal Club Mix) [there weren't a lot of great remixes for this song, but this is the worst IMO]<br /><br />THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY<br />- while I appreciate them releasing full length club mixes and not just radio mixes, 10 tracks is an incredibly small number considering none of these remixes are new. Where's \\"Break the Ice\\" or \\"Hold it Against Me\\"? Could they not have thrown in another Criminal mix? A new song, like And Then We Kiss from the first remix cd? I would also have LOVED to see remixes of non-singles, like \\"Kill the Lights\\" or \\"Freakshow.\\"<br /><br />OVERALL: For a cheap price, this is a good collection of hot dance music that will inspire you to shed the pounds on the treadmill. As a Britney fan, however, I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the lack of new content.

Just loaded it up with a 16 GB flash card and off we go. The id3 tagging is really nice, comes up on my stereo perfectly. Didn't really look for the best frequency to put it on and I very rarely get any static, even when I do it's much better than the Scosche. Really impressed! The remote is nifty to have too.

B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a creatively fun family movie, well worth adding to your collection even if you don't have kids at home. There is a lot of subtle humor in the movie as well as plenty of outright laughs and some not-so-subtle and hilarious parody references to the original Superman movie. I'm not a big Wil Ferrell fan but in this movie his voice over acting is superb. It's a great movie overall, and well worth watching repeatedly.
B004Z8ZFAI|4.0|The movie itself is a lovely story about love and finding your \\"heart.\\" However, the story has been done before. And done better. With that said, the animation is amazing! The colors truly pop off the screen. This makes the story. The music is not overpowering, but could have had a few more songs. The song Nigel (former \\"pretty bird\\") steals the show. It has enough adult humor without being over the head of the kids. The subject matter does get mature (the smuggling of birds) and Nigel is scary at times, so the more sensitive/younger child might not be the intended audience. Otherwise this is a nice movie for older children and adults who enjoy a love story and/or great animation. The extra DVD or \\"party edition DVD\\" is a waste of time. The extras are weak and weigh down the rest of the movie.
B005IS565S|5.0|This is a great album, i like all of the songs and it is a great buy. Can't wait to listen to it after classes today!
0307595579|5.0|I LOVE THIS.. i got my order gifted wrapped and my wife loves it.. she was so happy about it and i was expecting it on friday because I place my order on Monday but it got here on Wednesday... ONLY TOOK 2 DAYS.. WOW JUST WOW thank you amazon
1400079276|5.0|Good paperback quality, the book is so interesting you can read it again and get more out of it each time.
0439023513|5.0|I read enough reviews to be irritated by the general public and their need for \\"closure\\" or a happy ending.  Maybe that's what you expect from life, but it's not reality and if one does find closure or a happy ending it's not generally the picture that you had expected- it has changed with the hand life dealt.    I am a family therapist for kids returning from out of home placement (usually inpatient hospitals or residential treatment facilities) and many of my clients really appreciate this book...because it accurately portrays what happens to a person's \\"charisma\\" or character as they endure pain.  It is still there, but it morphs...and I loved that this book allowed Katniss to \\"pout\\" as some reviewers said, she deserves it!  She endured hell at a very young age and needed to come to grips with it in whatever way she could.  If you want happily ever after endings look elsewhere...if you want a glimpse into post-traumatic stress disorder in teens then appreciate this as a novel.  So many of my clients feel like they can't mature into the person they want to be with the past they've experienced- Katniss paints a picture of hope in that she experienced severe trauma and was even \\"committed\\" and in a \\"drug induced stupor\\" but pulled through...   So many talk of Katniss' power and how she never uses it, well the struggle for Katniss is feeling that every time she does she loses people she loves...would you wield your power if it killed those you treasure most?  It's not as simple as, \\"Katniss has all this power and charisma and doesn't apply it\\" but rather, \\"Katniss chooses to step up to the plate simply to save her sister's life and in that journey watches many others she cares about be wounded or killed.\\"    I felt especially irritated that one reviewer writes, \\"she settled down, had babies, and picked up scrap-booking\\"(what a disappointment?  Journaling is one of the best possible ways to cope with trauma...and that is what she was doing for herself- coping with theatrocities she had born witness to!
B005MMYCY6|3.0|This movie was very interesting, not what I expected from the title at all. I don't think I would watch it again. But when I was watching it I did not want to turn it off. Weird role for Natalie Portman and it was kind of a sad movie.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This is a nice little camera app. My kids love it. I can take a picture of them in sketch mode and print it so they can color themselves. Haha, pretty cool. Doesn't have a ton of features but still fun. I like that u can change pictures that you already have on your device too.
0440236738|1.0|I received an e-mail from Amazon saying that this book will be \\"released\\" in October. I read this book almost 10 years ago. AMazon's advertising was extremely misleading.  From now on, I use my book club or Library. Amazon,  you just lost a customer.
1442337966|5.0|These audio CDs really are fantastic at getting in the right frame of mind. There are a few things here and there, that I may not be on-board with all the way or have a slightly different take on. But I won't throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak. All in all I highly recommend it I have also purchased this for some of my relatives. It really is an amazing thing to be in control of your life and I feel that this CD can help you realize and draw from your strengths in helping you lead a full, successful and happy life.
1601251505|5.0|I love this book and game it has everything you need to start, besides creatures. I have played Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 for 6-7 years now and this game surpasses that. Though I love 3.5 I really love Pathfidner. The best thing is you can add anything form 3.5 to Pathfinder and its fits just fine!
B0052TDGQO|1.0|this album sucks...  i dont really think that he will be a big star like kenny chesney or alan jackson. i dont know to me his \\"singing\\" voice sounds fake...  heard a few songs off the album and iam not impressed
B0053KWDES|5.0|I have used the E11 for about 2 weeks. It has greatly improved the bass response and clarity of sound in my Senn595s. Unlike other amps, the small size and light weight make it convenient to carry while exercising. I have not noticed any hiss or distortion in the sound. I would also recommend using an LOD dock which is now available for the Zune players on ebay.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I got this to use when I'm.in bed and can't sleep or am nursing my baby in bed. Its great that it can sync up to the last page I left off on with my kindle.  one problem I had was sometimes when using it with the black background and white font color, the font will dim and be hard to read. otherwise I love this app.  I haven't had any issues with it.
0316010669|4.0|This is a pretty good book. I really enjoyed it, but am giving it a four-star rating because it's not as good as his other books, like Tipping Point or What the Dog Saw. Same format and some very interesting stories that draw you in, but it just didn't do it for me like the others.  I'd say go for this if you're a Malcolm Gladwell fan, but if you're new to him, start with Outliers or Tipping Point.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Good movie and received it quick and in great condition.  Just wish I had checked that I had the movie already, no worries gave it to my son for him to keep.  Thank you for the quick service...
B0055SWM08|5.0|So simple yet so very fun, this is one of those games that calls to you as you lie in bed. This is the paperclip of mobile games....
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Great movie very suspenseful and quite a turn around....great action.  Received it quick and in great shape...thank you so much...
B004USLWVE|5.0|Pricy but Perfect for widescreen laptops(17\\"-18\\")<br /><br />So far so good  and i just got it yesterday.<br />i got my t3i and a 17.3 widescreen laptop 2 lenses<br />some extension tubes and others filters on it.<br /><br />Now im ready for my Palawan, Philippines travel =)
0062011847|5.0|The book arrived via UPS today, shortly before noon and I have read it straight through without even a meal break.  Great Story!  Sam Vimes at long last is convinced by Lady Sybil to visit her old \\"country\\" home, Ramkin Hall.  They make the journey without mishap but soon after arrival Sam begins to sniff out something decidedly wrong that is happening in the area.    You can take the copper out of the city but you can't take the copper out of the man.  Or something to that effect.  Sam knows, without being told that someone is trying to manipulate him and he is determined to get to the bottom of it.  Sam ultimately discovers some dastardly doings in the neighborhood and also discovers that he has some unusual talents.  There is also another character in the story with an exceptional talent that surprises a great many people.    It's too bad the folks who have the Kindle edition are unhappy with it.  The story is, in my opinion, right up at the top of my favorites Terry Pratchett list.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love the Supernatural series. Love the stories and the right amount of campy humor thrown into the mix! Have the entire series so far!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is an excellent update for Blu-ray. There are problems with clay-face in the first couple films, but its only bad considering that George Lucas had millions at his disposal to polish these films for Blu-ray. It isn't so bad that it looks like some garage-made indie film. Everything else is great to flawless. The extras are extensive as well. 2 commentary tracks for every film, several fan-made films, etc. etc. Lastly, the packaging is great. The case is thick, hefty, sturdily-made and makes you feel like you're about to put something very special in that Blu-ray player.  Just ignore all the asinine fanboys riled up that George Lucas has made a handful of tiny tweaks. I was upset when Lucas made Greedo shoot first in 1997, and a lot of fanboys are trying to pretend that Lucas is doing the same thing again. He isn't. The modifications Lucas made are entirely superficial, and overwhelmingly for the better.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I absolutely disliked this book.  As other reviewers wrote, it is distasteful. And to me, pointless. I read a lot and love a good science fiction story but absolutely did not understand the allure of reading an entire book about children running around killing each other. I read half the book and I am sure there is a deeper story in its pages but I'm not willing to grit through the gruesome deaths to get to it.    I will not deny that it is a page turner.  It is.  What I did read, I read in 3 days.  And then I skipped to the end (just because I wanted to know what happened) and then deposited the book in the abandoned magazine pile at the gym.  If you like the idea of the story, then you should absolutely read the book.  But if the idea turns you off, like it did me, go with your gut and do not read the book. I wish I had never read it in the first place.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!  If there was a way to give it 100 stars I would... thank you so much received it quick and in great condition.  Best movie I have seen in a while!!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ignore the bad reviews. I've always loved Star Wars and love the blue ray recreation just as much. The audio and video are perfect. These are timeless classics.
0553801473|2.0|Most of my beefs with this have been aired here.  This author was brilliant over the 1st four books - what happened?  How could he go from that to books 5 and 6?  Makes me thing he either has hired ghost writers or someone milli vanill-ied 1-4.  Anyone agree? The difference is that stark. Wish he'd go back to the mindset he was in back then.  I quit.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|The advent of the all in one combo pack is fantastic especially if one has multiple devices which we do; 3D system, non 3D blu ray setup, vehicle DVD player and ipad/iphones.<br /><br />The movie itself was pretty slick for 3D, the story line left quite a bit to be desired imo, very predictable but hey, it's Marvel right?!<br /><br />I give it a 4 out of 5 overall because I gave it high marks for product and video/sound quality but deducted for the story but really, that's being honest but a bit nitpicky.
B0053Q9DQI|4.0|There have been numerous films made of Charlotte Bronte's great love story going back to the silent era.  This doesn't include scads of TV adaptations that appear every few years.  I think this is my favorite.  Mia Wasikowska stars as Jane giving the story true authenticity as a girl in her late teens.  As is the current flavor in movies today the story jumps back to capture a younger Jane being kicked out of her aunt's home in favor of a school for girls (read orphanage).  The film evolves into the meaty part where Jane (also in flashback) becomes the governess of a young French girl who is the offspring of a tryst between the master of the house, Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and another woman believed to have died.  Although romance in 19th century England is far removed from the mores of modern society, you can see the love spark between Jane and Edward.  What makes this story stand out however is the sliver of horror that haunts the grand old mansion.  If you are not familiar with the plot, there are some unsettling scenes involving thumps, bumps and other sound bursts.  Wasikowska plays the role with intelligence and understated beauty.  She's plain in appearance and direct in spoken word.  Speaking of words, they are beautiful to listen to, even if it's hard to catch them all in context.  The technical side of the film is also well done.  It is beautifully shot, artfully directed and sumptuously costumed.  This movie is charming, smart and easy to fall in love with.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Deathly Hallows 2 cribbed the best of the book and brought a few flourishes to life, but in order to be a viable movie much wonderment was lost.  I love the films but reading the books with my daughter was a magical experience that others should have. It was clear from the other reviews that some who really love Potter haven't read and its a great pity. The films are richer for the reading and so am I.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie is amazing! This is a classic for many years to come. It creeps out some of my female friends, so I love quoting the lines and sending pics from the movie stills to scare them once in a good while; especially around halloween.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I like the concept of this app but I don't like only being able to see the top 100 or 50 of an item I am searching.  maybe I need to explore this app a little more but I have bought a lot of things through amazon when I am on the go.  it is great for a quick purchases.  I love amazon a lot  so I won't be to hard on them especially since I live in the middle of nowhere USA and I want something you can only find in a bigger city.  so that's a plus.  over all it could be better but for me it serves its purpose.
B004A8EI9M|4.0|I was glued to my computer watching the first season. Very good series interesting characters and storyline. I look forward to season 2.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|These Pink Floyd box sets are expensive but also well worth the money,especially if you haven't bought most of this stuff before and are new to the band I say don't hesitate,buy it because you'll love it.If you are like me and already own a lot of this stuff you may hesitate but I think it is worth the money just for the unreleased music alone.There is something for fans new and old on these sets so I am willing to spend the money on them and am willing to say that you should do the same and get the entire Immersion Box Set collection by Pink Floyd.
B002ZG9940|4.0|George Clooney is the American here.  He is an assassin for hire and an arms expert.  We don't know much about his background or who hires him or to do what to whom.  In short there isn't much we know, other than someone is out to get him.  Why? Dunno.  In spite of the lack of plot rationale I bought into Clooney's character which says a lot for his performance.  Unlike his other films, here his character is quiet, methodical, serious and good at his job.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a Clooney film where we don't see his famous smirk or smile.  The setting is small town Italy and its environs.  And they look terrific in this slow paced thriller.  Equally beautiful is a bevy of local exotic European ladies that are great to look at.  I'm not sure a little Italian village would be home to so many gorgeous prostitutes.
B005S7GT32|5.0|Only as Peter Gabriel can - Add a full orchestra and show the depth of his genius across an amazing group of newly inspired scores of some of the best that he's produced.  If you have any love for Peter Gabriel - pre, during, or post MTV - this album will reward with some amazing re-imaginings of Gabriel's prolific repertoire.  Simply put - \\"This one is a must!\\"
B0020M99LC|1.0|James Bond 007, really, are you serious ?  Where are all the gadgets, Q, the Aston Martin WITH all kind of funny buttons, don't touch anything please !  The only one is the heart attack thing in the glove box, really, yep that's it. James Bond for the one who never understood it, is only for fun, these are not and never were serious spy stories, maybe the novel were but not the movies, it always been about crazy gadgets saving Bond from killers who never want to kill him simply and directly, SPECTER, if you don't get that by watching all the real originals ones with Sean Connery, and even more so with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, well just watch Austin Powers then, he will show you by the example what James Bond films are supposed to be in the first place, if you want serious spy stories, how about Tom Clancy adaptations, you know Jack Ryan, any clue ?  Here you have NO gadget at all, even the \\"hot girls\\", a James Bond tradition, in case you don't know are lame as one can be, they are cold instead of hot, oh yeah did i mention the dude trying to act, he cannot even speak but just mumble throughout the entire movie, instead of looking like an Irish tough guy, distinguish British dude cooler than ice, always delivering fine lines, he looks like a truck driver, speak like one, and carry himself like one, seriously, he even look bad in a Tux !  Even Timothy Dalton was a million times better than this thing.  The story begins with a foot chase like they don't need any oxygen to breathe never out of gas, and looking like Batman or Spiderman, indestructible, and then all stops, and the most interesting part of the movie is the poker game in the casino, James Bond really ?   The series was already going south with Pierce Brosnan looking more and more super human, and with less gadgets and fine lines, now, it is purely dead, enjoy all the classics, if you cannot see the difference, well that says it all right here.

B004EPZ08E|1.0|Got my copy today and am really upset.  No support for itunes, have to stream it over wifi, using the flixster app, that has crashed several times on me.  I will no longer be buying digital copies that are ultraviolet.  The only reason I paid the extra money was to be able to watch on my IPAD...If you own apple products and want to use the digital copy on apple products it will not work...
B004FPE4DK|4.0|James Vincent McMorrow is awesome. He can create a pretty great debut album that not only has commercial, pop sensibilities but that also weaves in folk elements of acoustic guitar and banjo with some beautiful, piercing vocals reminiscent of Bon Iver. Some notable tracks are \\"We Don't Eat\\" and \\"The Sparrow and the Wolf,\\" that while fairly pop-ey are also upbeat and hopeful. And while comparisons will be drawn between him and Fleet Foxes, Mumford & Sons and again, Bon Iver, have any of them taken 80s Steve Winwood's \\"Higher Love\\" and even Willow Smith's \\"Whip My Hair\\" and made them into remarkable pieces that are deconstructed enough to make them almost sad and haunting? And while neither of these covers can be found on the album, I think they hint at what is to come for this very talented Irishman. I am looking forward to what is to come.
B00337KMAA|5.0|This movie  received almost universal acclaim by mainstream critics when it was first released.  Of the few that didn't like it, the commentary seemed to be more about the subject of firing people from their jobs.  George Clooney stars as Ryan who works for a company that handles employment terminations for other companies that don't have the balls to do it themselves.  Hell, I never even knew companies like that existed.  Clooney is cool as a cucumber in the role as you might expect.  He has no real home, or even financial or emotional objectives.  He just wants to fly and live in hotels across the country.  His only goal in life is to become the 7th person to fly 10 million miles on American Airlines.  American, Hilton and Hertz are prominently featured throughout the movie which I suspect help keep production costs down.  Ryan hooks up with another frequent flyer played by Vera Farmiga.  They become sexually entangled as they cross paths in various cities.  As part of a planned less personal approach to terminations Ryan brings with him a new, bright recently hired addition to the firm.  Natalie is played with unusual wit and sophistication by Anna Kendrick.  While not romantically involved, she and Clooney really work well together.  Kendrick is not your usual knock-out-gorgeous woman, but let's hope she gets more meaty roles like this in the future.  This is a smart snappy film about an otherwise unfortunate event that goes on way too often in America these days.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I agree with the general consensus that Disney did a spectacular job transferring this classic into the 3D format but where was the much ballyhooed additional sequence Human Again that added so much to the original blu ray release last year?  Are we just supposed to forget that 8 minutes of music and animation were added to the overall experience in 2D?  Or is Disney hoping to release yet another disc in a year or two incorporating the scene into the 3D format?    This is triple dipping of the worst kind.  I love Disney and generally think they release home video products which are heads and shoulders above the competition but to add something in one release and then take it away in the next is insupportable.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|Love the cd but it's damaged. It stalls and repeats at one of the final tracks. I should have sent it back to be replaced, but didn't. I play it often but have to be alert that it will get stuck somewhere near the end.  Betty in Ohio
B003L77GGK|4.0|Love the Supernatural series and this is no different, i just wish it didnt take so long for Amazon to post things to you
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I purchased the exclusive deluxe album from Wal-Mart and I love it! Well worth the extra $3 for the exclusive album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|beautiful and addictive, deceptively difficult at times.  I can play this for an hour and it seems like minutes. Highly recomended!
B005EK4CFK|5.0|All Queen fans should own Deep Cuts 3 - because these songs are true gems hand picked by the band.  Get beyond all the hits you already know and love and hears some great Queen gems.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I am in love with this album. I love the way the hard-hitting drums and guitars mix with Amy Lee's soaring vocals, which are as strong and beautiful as ever. I love that the lyrics are interesting and emotional and that the overall sound of Ev's 3rd album is fresh and innovative. I love how I can hear traces of all the things I loved about 'Fallen' and 'The Open Door'. Evanescence's self-titled album stays true to the sound fans know and love, but takes risks with heavier-rock influenced instrumentation and more intense vocals!.  My favorite tracks on this CD are 'Made of Stone', 'My Heart is Broken', 'Secret Door,' and 'Never Go Back.'  Keep an open mind, and give this album a try! Listen to the record all the way thru several times and I guarantee you some of the songs that didn't catch your interests at first will become your favorites (ie. Never Go Back was one for me)
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I built a computer specifically for holding our DVD collection and connected it to our Plasma TV. All of our DVDs are just a click away now, no more getting up to find and change a DVD. This set makes a fine addition, ordering season 2 soon.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I love this movie. It is about a Jewish girl who just wants to learn about the scriptures, so she dresses up as a boy and goes to school. It is sort of a \\"Twelfth Night\\" type of theme when she pretends to be her brother and falls in love with a schoolmate who thinks she is a boy. The one she falls in love with is in love with another woman who is in love with her (because that woman thinks Streisand's character is a boy). This is similar to Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. There are a lot of movies out there with this theme, like \\"She's the Man\\".<br />Anyway, the man who plays the man she loves (Mandy Patankin) also plays Inigo Montoya in Princess Bride. He's an excellent actor!!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Crashes every other level. Love the game but a huge damper. can't be hardware please fix so I can play.
B0017T2NG2|5.0|So upon coutless people telling me how suspensfull and shocking andhow overall good this book was. Well there right on some levels yes there is plenty of suspense and close-calls and even some nail bitting sections, It's very well written and definitely hard to put down after the first chapter. Shocking though no the whole Jesus-N-Mary thing has been around for ever and wasn't suprised when the authors of holy blood holy grail called him on some of his points. I especially loved how up in arms the Christmunity got over it, But people were right it's good book a damn good book even.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I received the item \\"in time\\" and the movie/technique employee is excelent. In my house we like it very much.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|This is not about the picture or the sound quality, and I'll be brief about the films and concentrate on the extras. Basically, I give the films an increasingly better grade as the saga progresses in story order: TPM C-, AC B-, RS B+, NH A, ESB and RJ A+. While Episode I is dragged down by a plethora of racist stereotypes, annoying fart humor, and using CGI as a crutch (tragically against Lucas' 1980s mantra of \\"A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing; it is only a support\\"), Ep II is dragged down by the very atrocious acting and dialogue and complete lack of subtlety or sense in the Anakin / Padme love story. What keeps \\"Sith\\" from being A grade is the sheer weight of the legacy of the flaws of the other prequels, and of course, Vader wailing \\"Noooo!\\" Oh well, Lucas DID say he wanted to portray Vader as being a pathetic character. NH is untouchable, pristine classic SF/fantasy, and I like ESB and RJ the best. (Yes, even the Ewoks -- they're the perfect Vietnam parable / parody; it only got bad when the little furballs expanded into other stories.)<br /><br />(Mini-rant: And, yes, Lucas has tweaked the classic trilogy yet again. I got tired of complaining about it long ago. In summary, some changes are actually good, some indifferent, and some truly terrible. If Lucas (or maybe someday, his successors and/or offspring) would just make it a policy to Always make the original versions avaliable in whatever new medium and re-release comes up, everyone from fans to film historians would be So Much Happier, and we'd all be able to just ignore Lucas' idiosyncratic changes.)<br /><br />The artwork's interesting, although cardboard packaging for any digital media always makes me a little nervous. Sometimes those discs can be jammed in there tighter than R2's caked-on carbon scoring.<br /><br />Each film has two commentaries -- the old DVD ones (the only carryovers, by the way), and a new one, compiled from many sources. Even so, there is a lot of overlap with the older commentaries and some of the interviews in the archive discs.<br /><br />Archive Discs (7 & 8) -- Arranged by trilogy, then planet, then one of four categories of content:<br /><br />Interviews -- generally okay, some more in-depth or revealing than others ; depends on who's talking. Do you really want to hear Rick McCallum do his usual fawning EPK schtick? Sometimes Lucas makes sense, sometimes he's, erm, debatable. It's usually the section \\"overviews\\" that are most interesting.<br /><br />Concept Art Gallery -- for those of you who have some or lots of the \\"art of\\" and other \\"behind/scenes\\" books, anywhere from 50 to 85% of this stuff you've seen before. Easier and quicker to navigate than any of the other archive extras, so you'll be able to find the (for you) unseen droids.....artwork....you are looking for.<br /><br />Amongst the previous and following category, one will sometimes find matte paintings with a really sweet art-to-screen comparison that shows you exactly where and how it works in the movie, wiping back and forth between painting and film.<br /><br />360 Degree -- Basically a collection of models, costumes, creatures that you can get to rotate as you look at it. However, you cannot rotate some of the larger models, only pan from front to back. Each item has close-ups of selected areas. Many items have an always welcome, very interesting video commentary, some as long as near 15 minutes.<br />For those who care, the Boba Fett armor in the Episode V section (Pursuit) has a link to the infamous Nelvana animated short that introduced the character in the even more infamous SW Holiday Special of 1978.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes -- probably one of the most talked-about selling points. Unfortunately, for the prequels, none of the fascinating Del. Sc.s from the prequel DVDs were carried over. What we get on the Blu-Ray are sheer leftovers. (Episode II's C3PO 360 Degree documentary has some intriguing glimpses) So, none of that tantalizing Owenand Beru footage from Episode II that appears in bits on the 2000 VHS of the SE Trilogy. For the prequel trilogy, pretty much the only good del. sc.s are the animatics for sequences for \\"Revenge/Sith\\", with ideas ranging from the farcical to the near sublime.<br />Of course, the real meat of the deleted scenes are those for the classic trilogy on disc 8; life-long fans who have been hearing about, and reading the novelizations and comic adaptations, and seeing ultra-rare photos will finally be able to see and watch a lot of that rarefied material. (No \\"Empire\\" bits of Luke having his surgical face mask removed nor any Lando struggling to get Luke onto the Falcon, though).

B002ONC9NC|4.0|I liked this film without doubt, but I confess I was appalled at the bad parenting showed in this movie.  How can a parent allow her teenage daughter to date a much older man? Maybe it was normal for the 60's, but in these times, such a thing is considered a no-no.  She was besotted, seduced and fooled in the same way I was predicting she was going to be. In the end, I felt sorry for her, but...she learned her lesson.  Good performances. Mulligan's facial expressions are lovely and she deserved to be nominated for an Oscar.  Loved the clothes, hairstyles, decoration belonging to the era.    Even though the end was somewhat predictable, it is a good movie and I recommend it to every teenage girl who thinks she is too smart and deserves something better.  Don't try to grow up so quickly.  Enjoy your age and be grateful.
B005974CDU|5.0|First, Mike Mangini is not Mike Portnoy.  His work isn't as out front as Portnoy's but is technically top rate and fits in well with this material.  Second, I discovered that if I listened to each track individually I appreciated them a lot more.  The ballads don't seem to fit with the up tempo material and each track seems to not be like the track that proceeded it.  Third, like every DT recording the better the playback medium and the louder you can play it the better it sounds.  When the volume is up it becomes easier to hear the brilliance of each member.  My best results were with my $500 headphones.  The ballads are lyrically excellent and James never sounded better.  The guitar and keyboard work accompanying them is typical top notch DT playing.  The more up tempo cuts are all stunning in the depth and virtuosity of their composition and musicianship.  Each contains a lot of the ensemble playing that makes DT so special.  When everybody starts playing at top speed and it all fits together perfectly like it does here they are unmatched by any other band I have heard.  IMO - This is John Petrucci's best CD to date and Jordan also really sounds great (as always).    The only low point is the throat singing on \\"Bridges In The Sky\\" and even that worked when I saw them live.  If you are a fan you should have this one.  if your musical taste is more Yes than Iron Maiden then you will probably like this more but I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who considers themselves a Prog Metal person.
0143036424|4.0|This book has a great mystery, some romance(nothing a man couldn't handle!) and good characters.  It'll keep you guessing till the end and the story moves along to keep the pages turning.  I'll be buying more books in the Longmire series!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this for playing games. The thumb pad gives me a lot more hot keys than a regular keyboard. It takes a bit to get used to, but totally worth it.

B004EPZ08E|1.0|This is NOT a review of the movie which I haven't watched yet but I'm sure is great. I usually cringe at reviews like this but I just can't let this one fly.  Like stated in another review this \\"digital copy\\" is worthless to itunes users (most of us). I wish I would have known that before since this isn't worth anywhere near the $25 without it. I was planning on watching this movie on a flight on my ipad. I will not buy any movie with the new \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\". I'm returning this one even though it's opened because I feel this is a scam.

030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a story of Wade Watts, a teenager with the unfortunate problem of having grown up in the year 2045, a dystopian future where conditions in the United States have deteriorated to the point where most of its society seeks escapism in the form of the online world of The Oasis. Developed behind the masterful mind of the now deceased, James Halladay (an amalgamation of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs), The Oasis is what World of Warcraft and Second Skin could be is they had one billion users, decades of development, zero bugs, and completely immersible haptic feedback to the point where it becomes difficult to differentiate reality from virtual reality.  Halladay, having grown up in the 80's, has decided to will his fortunate (in the hundreds of billions), to one lucky individual who can solve his contest and discover the ultimate easter egg hidden somewhere in his game.  Wade has spent his life determined to be that winner.  But with millions of other contestants, and billions of dollars at stake, he soon finds out that many contestants will stop at nothing to see that the top prize goes to them.<br /><br />If the title alone isn't enough, it will only take the first chapter for the reader to discover that this book is loaded with 80's pop culture references.  Literally hundreds throughout the book on almost every page you turn. Having grown up in the 80s on Nintendo, comic books, and tv, this book was a huge nostalgia-fest for me.  I can remember spending hours trying to get past the grue in Zork I and feeding quarter after quarter into the 1982 game \\"Joust.\\"  Seeing those elements incorporated directly into the story brought back a lot of fond memories, and unfortunately, I'm not sure if all of those references will be caught or appreciated by anyone under the age of 30.  Additionally, the plot of this story is so entrenched in geekness, that I think it may be difficult for a \\"non-geek\\" to be entertained by it.  There is some traditional action, but the overwhelming majority of events take place inside The Oasis.  Someone who has never played an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) before might have trouble understanding the seriousness of spending hours trying to obtain an item that only exists in a virtual world, or how online currency can translate to the \\"real world.\\"  I've spent 10 straight hours camping a single spawn in Everquest before, so it's easy for me to understand the concept of extremism as it relates to gaming, but Cline takes this to an entirely new level when he puts billions of dollars at stake.<br /><br />Even though Cline's book is targeted toward a niche market, it is done so exceptionally well.  Anyone who has spent time in a virtual world, especially one that provides a Player vs Player environment, should have an appreciation for Wade's quest.  Wade Watts is what our society would currently call an \\"extreme gamer,\\" only in \\"Ready Player One,\\" the game is life itself, and the outside world has become so bleak and hopeless that winning this game is sometimes the only hope.t the overwhelming majority of events take place inside The Oasis.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is a fun, addictive game.  The additional features opened up by the elite version are way worth it!  I've had to keep my Incredible plugged in because I've been playing it so much.  A must for those who played Tradewars back in the BBS days.
B002VPE1PW|3.0|nice quality. No chemical odor, smooth zipper around three sides.  But... A little too large for the iPad, I would have preferred a more snug fit.  For the price, though, it cant be beat!!
B0037VNX44|2.0|This \\"movie\\" deserves a one star rating, not the two I gave it. I suppose the makers of the film were trying to make some sort of statement or something. It was lost on me. As my title suggests, this not a movie. It is a very long and boring series of shorts, supposedly scenes in the life a very odd character. All the way through, this film never deviates from the \\"snapshot\\" style introduced at the beginning, while the entire thing is narrated by the actor with dull boring commentary that really offers nothing in the way of commentary. It's mindless.  At no point did I find this \\"Bronson\\" character intimidating. He was a twerp, a goofball, and nothing like a hardened criminal. His constant changes between \\"laughing and serious,\\" \\"sad and violent,\\" \\"neurotic and violent,\\" \\"goofy and angry,\\" simply were not realistic. It always ended up looking like a theater actor trying hard to act like he was criminally insane. Interspersed between the drab and disconnected snapshots of this man's life were some very odd scenes where he was performing in front of an audience. I never did figure that one out. I just couldn't waste another minute watching this waste of time. It was not clever. It was not artsy. It was not realistic, not in the least. It was not a movie. It was some dudes with some cameras who set up some scenes and strung them together. It was humorous at a few points, but for all the wrong reasons. The actor/character was a buffoon.  I watched \\"Bronson\\" for free on Amazon Prime and did not have access to subtitles. For me, a non-British English-speaking person, the accent/dialect was very hard to follow. I could barely make out a majority of the words spoken. I don't supposed it would've made my experience any better though. It's something for people outside the UK to take into account.
B004YM67TI|3.0|Red Riding Hood is a sort of reimagining of the old Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, however the story stray so much from the original story that this can not be called a fairytale movie. The story revolves around a young woman named Valerie who is in a love triangle having to choose between the blacksmith her parents want her to marry and the man she loves Peter. Now as it would have it Valerie's village have been plagued to a werewolf for generations, when the beast finally kill a young girl in the village, Valerie's sister, people have had enough and call in a Inquisitor like monster hunter to slay the beast.<br /><br />Now good things about this movie is the beautiful visuals, allot of details have been put into the characters and the costumes. The locations are breathtaking and even the computer graphics werewolf looks ok. Other good things about this movie are the characters, they are actually likable, the main character is a typical maiden in distress, but she is the kind of person you want to see rescued, both the love interests are decent, even the villain is interesting. Yes these characters are cookie cutter but at least the cookies have been given some nice paint.<br /><br />The bad things about this movie is that is is a jumble, it can not decide if it want to be a fantasy film, a dark witch hunter tale or a romance film and it juggle those three aspects very poorly so that we have a start which is almost completely romance and then we have  a full on Inquisition film and then we have fantasy and so on, as a result it feels like the director could not decide what sort of movie she wanted to make and we end up with a sort of Frankenstein mix of a film which feels very confusing. This movie is also quite bland, you will see allot of pretty teenagers staring deeply into the darkness lamenting their love life, which get boring after a while.<br /><br />Many people do not want to give this movie a chance. They see that the same people worked on this as on Twilight and they assume it is the same movie, just set in the middle ages. Now to be fair this is a teenage romance with supernatural elements, if you are looking for a horror movie you will not find it here, the relationships between the characters are more important here than the monster, and in fact you do not see the werewolf on screen that often, this can be seen as a good thing though as this movie is more about the paranoia over who the werewolf is and whatever or not love can survive such paranoia than it is a monster movie. That being said, while there are some similarities this is not dark ages Twilight. If romance is not for you at all then off course you will not like this movie, but if you like a bit of paranormal romance then this might be just up your alley.<br /><br />I enjoyed Red Riding Hood, the movie kept my attention all though the runtime. This is however a flawed movie, it have some issues and is not for everyone, but if the supernatural, love affairs and maidens in pretty dresses in distress are your thing then I do recommend this movie, at least give it a rent to give it a chance.the same movie, just set in the middle ages.

B0009VBTA0|5.0|I love this album! It's my favorite CD to test a new sound system with. The music is 3D, you can close your eyes and feel the music, the cave, all around you!
B002L5GQGY|4.0|This was a gift for my husband, who definitely appreciates a good guitar player more than me.  He will put this DVD in any chance he gets, and the surprising thing is I don't mind!  The music is great and it's fun to watch the short interview clips.  The music sounds like a mix between Eric Johnson (also a great artist) and Eric Clapton.
B0006Z2KIY|2.0|This was a good love story, a tear jerker, but it was not romantic. A real romance is not one where you have to go back and forth from one guy to another because you don't even know what you want. In a real romance, you just KNOW. Allie was portrayed as spoiled and wishy washy. I'm not even complaining of her infidelity, because I'm glad she made the right choice and chose Noah. But to think she could just sleep w/Noah and then go back to her fiance....thats just made me want to smack her. The older Noah and Allie were cute, but I just fell asleep when they came on.   In the end, the only thing that held this \\"love\\" story together was the deep love Noah had for Allie, which was beautiful. Everything else was pretty dumb.  I just hope young people don't watch this and think this is as good as it gets, cause it can be so much better.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This was one of the best in the Xmen movies. It was awesome to see how the Xmen came about. It was also great to see the how the relationship between Xavier and Magneto began
B005LAIGBY|2.0|Based very loosely on the rather interesting 1991 book \\"The Feather Men\\" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, \\"The Killer Elite\\" shows Hollywood cowardice at its best: successfully emasculating, with formulaic, politically correct stereotypes, what should have been a very good film.  While normally enjoying Jason Statham in the various characters he has played on the big screen, watching his character (Danny) and his group of thuggish assassins murder British Special Air Service (SAS) veterans was extremely difficult.  And why, you may ask, do Danny and his team kill these SAS veterans?  According to the film: in order to save an absurdly cast Robert De Niro.  After watching De Niro for about a minute, I would have just left him in the prison and gone out and had a pint with the SAS veterans (and Clive Owen, who was great in this film).   Some of the scenes in this film are very good.  And, some of the action sequences, taken in a vacuum, are also very good.  However, action and scenery do not make a good film, and \\"The Killer Elite\\" is, sadly, another example of the principle.    The screenwriters not sticking to the original story from Sir Ranaulph's novel was the death blow to \\"The Killer Elite.\\"  So, if you are in the mood for yet another Hollywood, watered-down, politically correct, \\"action\\" film, this one is for you.  If not, I would still recommend reading the book and then renting this film just to see how bad Hollywood was to the original story.        Two stars (although, I have no doubt, this could have been a four-star quality film).
B001J8DXFG|5.0|This is another great album Enya has done. It reminds me of her older music, some of the songs anyway. Softer. I'm not a fan of the big beat songs she's been making recently. My most favorite albums were  Shepherd Moons , Watermark , and Memory of Tree's. If she can start making CD's like those again, I would be SO happy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|the visuals are great, it reminds me of Myst when I first played it. the effort put into providing challenging puzzles that don't become repetitious is refreshing. I'd buy it for twice the price.
B005F6NA56|5.0|This music is moody,beautiful, and slow-paced. It has a 1970's vibe to it. If you're a fan of Feist first album Let It Die, this is the album for you. It almost makes me think of the film Into The Wild.  Favorites:  Graveyard  How Come You Never Go There  A Commotion  Bittersweet Melodies  Undiscovered First  Comfort Me  You should play this at a dinner party,autumn/winter weather,having a good healthy cry,exploring the world.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|This is the best album I've heard all year. I've this album on repeat I can't turn this album off! I really enjoy this album. I think this album was worth the long wait, the only thing that would of made it better if this was a double album with more songs, since they have been away for so long, I know their fans would of appreciated that and paid the extra cost for it as well. Evanescence has always been one of my favorite bands, since Fallen came out back in 2003,( I was 12 then ).  I think this album is something old, and something new. They have evolved on this album. I think they are back better than ever, and stronger. If you love them you should defiantly get this album. I've been waiting forever for a new album by them. I hope they stay around for a long time. In my opinion they are one of the best bands around. They are a big inspiration to me. This album has had a lot of anticipation the last two years, and I'm glad it's finally released. This is one of the best mainstream albums I've heard in awhile. I know anything Amy Lee does I'll be a fan of. I heard in an interview that she might do a solo album down the line, because she has the martial for it. I still wonder if some of the lyrics are about ex members who left the band, and are now in We Are The Fallen  New Way To Bleed  listen to this song really closely. No one will ever be , or will replace Amy Lee, she has one of the best voices out there. This is my favorite album of 2011. I recommend you get the Deluxe Edition for the extra songs, and the DVD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this trilogy.  I loved all three books.  I was really surprised to see all the negative reviews this book got.  For me it was refreshing to read a book where the character had real flaws and didnt end with a happy ending.  Life is hard...... people dont live fairy tale lives.  In the last book Katniss is only 19 or 20 years old..... she shouldnt be this strong woman who has figured life out.  What 19 or 20 year old has?  I think Suzanne did an excellent job making this character realistic.
B004XANKVO|5.0|This backpack is perfect for a bicycle commute. The water-resistant material ensures that the contents remain dry when it rains. The adjustable chest strap takes some weight off your back.  The laptop compartment fits a 16.4\\" laptop snugly. The hard case compartment allows greater protection for a cell phone, sunglasses, etc. The reflective \\"Thule\\" logo on the back provides visibility in the dark. This backpack is worth the price.
B005IS565S|5.0|FFDP as they are known to their fans have a very infectious style. This their third album will not disappoint their fans. Some may find a couple of tracks surprising in particular the track Remember Everything, which in my opinion is a very moving piece of music. Ivan Moody like some of the best song writers seems to use his own emotions and issues as a source for his writing.   Ivan's vocals both clean and growling have improved immensely. Zoltan and Jason Hook provide driving riffs making it difficult not to bang your head. FFDP are never going to appeal to everyone and that is fine, but if you are looking for something to get your heart thumping and your ears ringing buy this album and then go see them live when they hit your town .  [[ASIN:B005IS565S American Capitalist]]
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I agree with those who say this album sounds more put together and mature. While I will always love \\"Fallen\\" and \\"The Open Door,\\" and even the throwback \\"Origin\\" tracks, I love me some rock, and this album truly rocks. It really feels like Evanescence has taken a huge step forward and become a true band, rather than being focused on Amy Lee. That's not to say I don't love her and the ballads she's composed, because I do. They've gotten me through some of my darkest days, and I feel like Amy Lee is out of her darkest days as well.   This album is powerful, energetic and well made. The harmonies are gorgeous and still have that reminiscent haunting feel, and Amy Lee truly shines on tracks like \\"Made of Stone\\" and \\"My Heart is Broken.\\" And \\"Swimming Home\\" is an amazing song.   For most fans, this will be determined well worth the wait.
0810970686|4.0|Is our newest Will Rogers going to turn out to be Greg Heffley? The humor is still gentle, but there are points being made.  While everything is, of course, exaggerated for effect, there is an effect here, and isn't that just remarkably different from pretty much everything else that's published for Greg's target audience?
0061438294|4.0|I have read a number of books on Body Language. This one is as good as any that I have read. While the science itself leaves a bit to be desired and most of us are sort of experts by nature (and nurture) this book made me interested again in paying more attention to what the feet and torso are going as well as the more common things to watch.   Good read and for many this would be a huge help to doing well in a lot of different circumstances.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|First and foremost: Natalie Portman is no actress. The Academy Awards lost all credibility when she was awarded an Oscar for Black Swan. This film has nothing to offer except special effects if you like that sort of thing. And Athony Hopkins must be desperate for work to make this debacle. Reminded me of a poor version of Star Man.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is the only alarm that wakes me up. others wake my family up but not me. not this one
B0055V6EZE|5.0|What a superb piano player Mr. Laurie is!! Surprised and pleased am I with this fine album. House can also play the Blues. Who knew? Tell me, who knew? You just can't be disappointed with this album.   Hugh can get together with another fine blues vocalist and piano player I first heard earlier this year... Eden Brent. These two could make a magical album together.
0810994739|4.0|Success has not spoiled Greg Heffley. This second outing is, again, mellow, funny, insightful and authentic. Given the first book's crazy success, author Jeff Kinney might have been tempted to swing for the fences. Instead, he has recreated the voice of an endearing character. Don't know how long he can go, but so far so good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best games ever! Dangerously addictive... The music is soothing to the nerves too. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.
1439192812|5.0|Simply a beautiful book, entertaining, captivating and Factual!  Just finished reading it myself, look forward to the family discussions after my children read it. :D  I have to admit I was a little hesitant to give it to the kids at first, while I'm a fan of Dawkins he is very harsh at times towards religion.  And while I'm not raising my kids, in any religion.  They are a little to young to understand the reasons behind the harshness.    If that is your hesitation have no fear.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This series was a surprise to me. I was just randomly browsing books on the Kindle store and found this and I must say I was impressed. It's a fun, well written series that really reminds me a lot of the Dresden series.
159562015X|5.0|While you may think you know your strengths, if you read the through the list of strengths and guess what yours are, you may be surprised when you actually do the on-line test. Some of my top five strengths were among what I assumed were my strengths, but not all.  I am currently unemployed as was looking for a way to feel good about myself so that I could market myself better, and this book did the job.  Knowing my strengths helped me feel immediately confident in a way that seems counterintuitive (don't we all know our strengths? Perhaps, but maybe you didn't think of that aspect of yourself as a strength).  Very helpful for me and I recommend it for those looking to \\"find themselves\\" and feel more confident. Much better than a self-help book, which always seems to leave me feeling empty.  This book made me feel instantly worthy and boosted my self-esteem in a permanent way.
0810993139|4.0|Greg Heffley is exactly the deadpan everyman that seventh grade readers will like. No fantasy, no adventure, no existential angst. Just a gimlet eyed view of middle school from a narrator who's not too impressed by himself.<br /><br />  And maybe that's the key. Author Jeff Kinney is not full of himself. Greg is not self-deluded. No one here is straining to write the Great American novel. A few honest insights and a few good laughs is quite enough.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|WARNING: This Series Is Extremely Addictive (Spoiler FREE Review)   This series truly has a perfect balance. The drama, both crime and family, is portrayed excellently. There is a nice blend of dark and light humor. The action and tension keeps you addicted and craving more. Then there are equal parts of character development and exploration that add a nice depth to the mix. Add all those elements together and they have found the perfect formula for this series. It really earns it's reputation as one of television's greatest series (filling a specific void that has been lingering since series like The Sopranos, The Shield and The Wire left our screens). This season is great and Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to show how they earned their respective 2010 Best Lead/Supporting Actor Emmy Awards. Their pairing and subsequent chemistry are what binds this series together.   Some have said this season was too slow for too long and that the series lost its previously inspired pacing, I had similar thoughts but trusted the writing staff and if the beginning of the season is slower paced the last four or five episodes certainly balance out the equation with nonstop twists, action and developments.  The fourth season consists of the following thirteen episodes:   1 Box Cutter   2 Thirty-Eight Snub   3 Open House  4 Bullet Points   5 Shotgun   6 Cornered   7 Problem Dog  8 Bug  9 Hermanos  10 Salud   11 Crawl Space   12 End Times  13 Face Off   This season is once again amazingly crafted. It picks up exactly where the third season left off with a suspenseful and eventful premiere that sets up a conflict that plays out the entire season, slow burn has been most used to describe it. If it seemed to slow down after that initial episode and focus on character exploration it can be forgiven as the show has earned that by this point. By episode 9 things are clearly building to an endpoint of magnificent crafting and the final 5 episodes are amazingly entertaining in escalating proportion. The key to this fourth season will be rewatch value, what seemed to be slower paced filler will be seen in second viewing as establishing important plotlines that needed to pay off by the finale.  A finale which Gilligan has said was crafted to be satisfactory as a series finale in case the show didn't make it back (which thankfully it has).  *The one thing I agree felt random though was a storyline that once again focused on Marie stealing things, not sure what that paid off towards in the long term? Anyone else have ideas?   Special Features:   I'll list the official specs when they are announced but these sets always have behind the scenes and some informative audio commentaries with Vince Gilligan and the actors. While I love Mad Men and those sets reveal a lot of information in their commentaries they are nowhere near the Breaking Bad sets when it comes to behind-the-scenes. The Breaking Bad sets are, in my opinion, the best television series sets you can buy for your money.  Both in terms of features and the aforementioned rewatch value.  The other thing about Breaking Bad, and I've said it before but will keep saying it, is that it has it's own unique niche. There are other great series on television, arguably Mad Men, Walking Dead and Boardwalk Empire among others, but Breaking Bad has something all its own. It doesn't have a period setting, it doesn't have any supernatural elements such as vampires or zombies, it is set in a modern day reality. While those other things are fun, Breaking Bad is a refreshing series that doesn't have to pay service to anything other than its story. This means that it is always attemping to tell its story in unique and interesting ways. They are always trying to break new ground and push the envelope in every way. The directing, the music selection, the writing/storytelling, every single element of this series tries to do something new or original and it is quite apparent when watching any of the episodes.  Viewers also have to realize how little funds this great series is given to work with in comparison with others, keeping that in mind I'd say they definitely utilize their money for optimum production value. So if this season seems to play slower in the begining I say that after three amazing seasons the writer's and crew have earned that right. This will no doubt be the most breathing room the series ever has, now that there are officially only 16 episodes left in its production life, they will be running towards a finish in a fashion one can only expect from Breaking Bad.  I should note I own the first three seasons on Blu-ray and they look great, but I've also seen them on DVD and they still look pretty darn good, so DVD buyer's won't be missing much. That said I'll definitely being going all in for the fourth time and getting the Blu-ray. I had withdrawal symptoms while waiting between the third and fourth seasons and while I hope they take time to craft the final 16 episodes properly I really want to get my next fix started by next year at this time. I can't wait to buy this and hopefully it comes out long before the fifth season so that I can have a temporary fix, though I assume they will try to coincide its release with the next season premiere as per usual.
0525423281|5.0|After reading Anna and the French Kiss earlier this year, I fell in love with Stephanie Perkins. I love the way she could tell a story and put me right there in the middle of it with a cast of vibrant characters I would love to befriend. Thankfully, she retained that gift of telling a heart-warming tale of a girl falling in love in Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />It's so hard for me not to make comparisons between both of Perkins' books, but I'm going to try. At first I found Lola somewhat irritating. The way she blatantly ignored the fact that her boyfriend, Max, was a tool to everyone else got under my skin like you wouldn't believe. When everyone tells you the guy isn't as great as you think? You might wanna listen. Just saying. It didn't take me long to love her, though. Her individuality is stunning to read and an inspiration to teenagers. I love that she made a resolution to wear something different every day, and that her clothing typically depicted exactly how she was feeling. I love that she wasn't afraid to be different.<br /><br />The story between her and Cricket is just ... *sigh*. Literally. It gave me the dopiest, goofiest grin for the majority of the book. I just loved reading their scenes together. The whole supporting cast was plain fantabulous (fantastic + fabulous = fantabulous). From Lola's two dads, to her crazy mother that occasionally made sense, to her best friend and even Calliope. This cast is as rich and colorful as Lola's many wigs.<br /><br />My only real complaint (if you even want to call it that), is that I didn't feel the same magic in San Francisco that I felt Perkins captured in Paris with her debut novel. She made Paris a character in Anna and the French Kiss, and I just felt that connection with San Francisco lacking in this book. I wish I could've fallen in love with this city, too.<br /><br />Basically, a good rule of thumb to live by is: If Stephanie Perkins writes it, read it. Buy it, own it, cherish it. Her books are little slices of heaven; a sweet escape from reality to a world where love really does conquer all.from reality to a world where love really does conquer all.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|If you have the regular perplexus,  then this one will not meet your expectations.  Although it is harder than the original that can only apply if parts of the maze do not break, which then render it useless.  Within a week one piece broke off.  Unfortunately we could not return it because we purchased it and held onto it for a birthday.  Its been about 2 months and another piece is broken.  We have had the original for over 2 years and that one is still in great condition, which shows they did this one on the cheap....  I don't plan on getting another one, and I would not recommend purchasing it unless you are extremely careful...
B003QNXPUK|1.0|This product is absolute trash.  Overpriced and only lasted 4 months.  So I send it back for a warranty, and I get one back.  Following the installation instructions, I got speckles and crap all over the front and was impossible to clean.  So, now I get to mail it back and wait another 2 weeks while they mail me another 1 shot attempt at sticking it.
030788743X|5.0|I was given the chance to review this book and I took the chance based on the concept of the book, the reviews already posted, and the fact that I am a geek for 80's culture which this book is marinated with.<br /><br />Simply put, after finishing this book in just a few sittings, I just really fell in love with this book.  The first few pages of the book really drew me in, and frankly, never let go.  When the charecter ended his avatar session, I certainly felt that I was logging off as well.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the book, but I loved the concept of the avatars, and the artificial world that helps people escape from a declining standard of living. This book definitely takes place in a dystopian world.  It is part Orwell's 1984, and part Gibson's Neuromancer, and a whole lot of geek references to the 1980's.  This is not some dark political comment, but rather the dystopian world the main character Wade Watts inhabits serves the good thrilling story.<br /><br />Heck, I remember playing Adventure and watching Excalibur on cable after my parents went to sleep (there were naughty scenes rumored by the other kids in school after all).  Apparently, so did the author!  The book is really excellent science fiction adventure, because it takes place in the year 2044, but yet the story still seems immediate and possible.  I never really thought that the inventions described in the book were too outrageous.  And frankly, the narrative is just wonderful.  There are many references that are both obvious, and more obscure, and this makes for a nostalgic trip, but still a compelling story.  In other words, the world of this book is readily familiar, despite being new.<br /><br />I am not surprised to see this book has already been optioned for a movie.  I was already suggesting to myself as I read the book how certain scenes would play out in a movie, and, of course, I thought about which actors that would make for good casting.<br /><br />In short, this is one of those books that reads very fast and is vastly entertaining.  This was a book I was disappointed to read to the end.  A great read!astly entertaining.  This was a book I was disappointed to read to the end.  A great read!
006112429X|3.0|Honestly, the story was amazing.  Although I can't say that I enjoyed the plot line (this isn't a warm & cozy story), it was outstanding in the way that things that grab your attention and won't let you go are outstanding.  The problem?  The writing.<br /><br />This author seems to think that she has to write as if her readers are uneducated, idiotic morons who understand nothing.  The language she chose to use throughout the entire story made me think that she was one of those students in college who used lots of big words in her essays over and over again, hoping that her \\"intelligence\\" would fool the professor into thinking she knew what she was talking about.<br /><br />I don't mean to be so harsh, but this would have been a 5-Star read if she had just written in the language of which people speak.  WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is a haunting, heartbreaking, insanely real story - but you'll have to force yourself through the pseudo-intellectual speak to enjoy it.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I can't give this book 5 stars because it left some untidy supporting character endings. Over all though it is another Sparks best seller. Grab the tissues.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I am not a fan of Thor but this is a great movie.  The 3D version is the way to go.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|A classic, don't miss it. Just read it, you will live an epic literary experience. You will not be disappointed.
1594744769|4.0|Although it ends a little abruptly, perhaps begging a sequel???, this is a fun read. Along the lines of Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, etc., a kid who thinks he's ordinary and turns out not to be has the adventure of his life which again, seems like the story could go on once this book ends. Worth it if you're a fan of the aforementioned fantasies.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Would have given 5 stars if I wasn't f o r c e d  t o r a t e .
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I am a great xmen fan and this is another great movie for the series.  Even if you are not a fan you will like it.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth...and Bjork transcribed said creation into electronic music which blew my mind clean out of my butt. But all joking aside, this is an amazing album, many will dislike it but i personally am in awe and shall be for quite some time, plenty here to occupy your mind during the dull parts of the day.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app provides hours of entertainment, trying to find ways to feed candy to the monster.  As the game progresses,  new game elements keep it fresh and challenging.  Also,  hours into the game,  I still laugh at the cute little monster.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|THANKS A LOT, I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS ITEM. IT GOT HERE ON SCHEDULE AND AS SHOWN BY THE SELLERS... IT WAS A NICE PURCHASE...
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|The dvd was just as described and was very satisfied with the product.  I would order from them again. thanks
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Wish he had re edited it so much.  I had memorized the original.  Even the primitive special effects in episode 4 were changed.  Sometime the original is best.  Video quality was exceptional and it was technically great.  Even the sound was stunning with the walkers in episode 5 and 6.  Technically a great blu ray but the re-editing leave a lot to desire.  Extra were better then expected.  Wish George Lucas would have left it alone.  My kids never saw the original episode 4 since Lucas messed with the early 90s release.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I actually use this more often than my camera now :) every picture turns into artwork...found that moving the camera while taking pictures smears the coloring pretty nicely. What would be a blurry out of focus shot is now even more artistic.
B005IS565S|5.0|They avoided the sophomore curse and continue to impress. So if you told me a few years ago that no band could mix the old school power of bands like Pantera and the progressive guitar work coming out of northern Europe I would have said \\"can't be done\\". Five Finger Death Punch deliver on every level of the new metal scene on their third album American Capitalist. It has searing guitar solos, powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a double bass kick that will simply kick your ass. Don't believe me, just check them out.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|The DVD was in 100% condition and I enjoyed it very much. It was sent in a very timely manner as well.
0739340131|5.0|I just bought another audio version of World War Z for my brother.  We've spent years loaning our favorite books (both Brick & Mortar and Audio versions) back and forth to each other but  Bro is a plumber & sometimes these books meet an early demise during his lunchtime reading hour.  I was so enchanted by the whole premise of this book that I knew this was one to share - so I just ordered him another so he wouldn't destroy mine.<br /><br />The audio version is \\"Theater of the Mind\\".  There are multiple readers who take us through the history of the Zombie Crisis from a personal perspective.  You become so caught up in the story that you start thinking as I imagine the War of the Worlds hysterics did when they first heard the Wells program.  The story can become a little tense as you follow the history through the eyes of individual accounts as read by such pro's as Aan Alda, Mark Hamill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl Reiner.  As another review said they  \\"deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters\\"<br /><br />This is truly a book that can be enjoyed by fans of the Zombie genre and those who just look and shake their heads.  I'd recommend the audio version to all.
B004N66XYE|4.0|Fabulous mini-series! Great acting and an enjoyable plot. Definitely recommend for fans of bbc movies. Keeley Hawes is beautiful and does an excellent job. I loved the development of the characters and how the staff grew to be more like a family.
B004EPZ07A|3.0|Formula movie that I actually liked -- but couldn't understand why Jennifer Goodwin's character was best friends with Kate Hudson's character. The person Kate Hudson plays is so immensely unlikable I can't understand why these characters are drawn to her. Besides that point, Jennifer Goodwin does an excellent job with her role and John Krasinski steals the movie. I would have liked to seen more of him. No great message here but John Krasinski and Jennifer Goodwin are worth watching.
0062060554|5.0|Enjoyed this book, very sorry to see it end.  Hope the author working on another!Great suspense and good character development.
0385738773|3.0|\\"The Death Cure\\" is the third book in the dystopia trilogy by James Dashner, in which he tried to provide answers to everyone's questions.  Tried.<br /><br />Dashner continues with the story of Thomas, isolated in an empty bleak room, not by choice, trying to figure out what just happened, and to understand what is about to happen.  He is still fighting the notion that \\"WICKED is good.\\"  How can WICKED be good if their spokesperson is The Rat Man, who makes his appearance yet again in \\"The Death Cure.\\"  The experiments conducted in The Maze and The Scorch were supposed to provide how to cure sickness called The Flare.  Thomas is going through significant internal turmoil.  How to get even with WICKED and the people who control them?  Does he trust Teresa, and therefore trust WICKED, or does he succumb to his hatred for her?  Finally, the ultimate yet frustrating realization that without Thomas, there would be no WICKED, there would be no escape from the Maze, there would be no Trials, and none of his friends would have died or been in danger.<br /><br />In this third installment, the groups who participated in the Scorch Trial (The Gladers and Group B), were once again reunited, and were given the option to have their memories restored.  Most took the opportunity, a select few did not.  Theresa was all for having her memories restored, not surprisingly given her \\"WICKED is good\\" stance.  Thomas and a few others were hesitant.  They needed to find out as much as possible while they were in WICKED headquarters... and Thomas did not want to find out what he knew and his role in the experiments before he entered the Maze.  Somehow, they escaped... or did they?  The time for lies is over.  But is the truth any better?<br /><br />The plot moves well.  The action and the tension constantly builds.  Lots of twists and turns.  Thomas is torn between what he feels is right and what he thinks is real.  Trust WICKED, and by default trust Teresa.  Don't trust WICKED, and listen to Brenda.  A character comes back from the dead.  They all go to Denver (They all go to Denver?!).  Thomas' character flaws were somewhat emphasized in this novel.  He is not the perfect leader who makes all the right decisions.<br /><br />My first criticism is the lack of character development in this book.  Of course, most of the characters were well-established in the two previous books.  And, it would have been nice to get a bit of back-story in this novel.  Not a big deal if you read the three books sequentially and without a significant gap in time, but it's a year between Scorch Trials and Death Cure, and I forgot about many of the previous characters.  Also, this book raises as much questions as there are answers.  For example, there was no final resolution IMHO that explains or defines Thomas' role in the design and purpose of the experiments.  I was a bit disappointed with how Teresa's character (which was quite significant in the two previous books) was somewhat downplayed in this novel.  Finally, in the end I felt disappointed and slightly empty-handed with the resolution.  It felt too open-ended and rather predictable.  I was hoping for a few more chapters.<br /><br />This book is certainly not my favorite of the three, but nevertheless it is a good read, and I recommend it along with the previous two books that make up this trilogy.  It reminds me of how I was slightly disappointed with Mockingjay at the end of the Hunger Games trilogy.  Some will like it, some won't.  Just like Saccharine, I suppose.<br /><br />I would like to congratulate James Dashner on another successful series.  I am looking forward to his next project.comes back from the dead.

030745455X|5.0|This is the sequel to Larsson's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. It picks right up where the first book leaves off and charges forward in another great mystery/suspense thriller.  I had the good fortune to receive all three of Steig Larsson's \\"The Girl....\\" books last Christmas during a slow time of year and read them in about a month.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is an engrossing mystery and thriller that I looked forward to picking up in every spare moment, as I did with \\"Tattoo\\".  Lisbeth Salander, one of the most original and interesting characters I've ever come across in fiction investigates her own mysterious and frightening background and needs famous writer/investigator Mikael Blomkvist's help in book two of the trilogy. Murder, international diplomacy and spying, fraud and additional freakishly memorable characters make their appearance in \\"Fire\\" and keep it a page turner.<br /><br />The pacing is taught, the characters well defined and Larsson has again created a believable and highly readable work of wonderful escapism.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for an intelligent and interesting book of fiction.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a &#34;no put down&#34; book.  The men in this book are the true meaning of heroes.  Our country couldn't be more proud.  They sacrificed their all.  Please read this, for nothing else but to realize what is going on in this country and, especially Afganistan.  It's scary, and makes you realize what a real Seal is.....God Bless Them.  Read the book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this series.  Right blend of humor and action.  Nice graphics, talented cast, and good scripts keep it interesting from start to stop.  Hollywood doesn't make a lot of sense given their cancellation of this program and considering all the trash it continues to manufacture.  The movie, Serenity, was excellent as well.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|My reading interests vary from Stephen King to Charles Dickens, from Evanovich to biography. Well, I confess, I wanted a book to read on my Ipad while I waited for a book to arrive at my library. I stumbled across this one at just 1.99 at Amazon.com and thought I'd give it a try, recognizing the author's name but not having read her books.<br /><br />HAHAHA! What a fun, light read! I don't mean 'light' in a bad way either, I mean this book is just fun and easy to put down, pick back up again. I found myself reading shorter bits and not wanting it to end, savoring the wit of the main character and the very idea for the storyline. As a writer myself, I admire writers who can just grab you from the beginning, and have you put yourself into the storyline as it goes. Well, Kinsella is wonderful at that. I really rooted for poor Emma C. I think we can all identify with her on some level. Working hard, afraid of looking like a dolt but then putting herself into situations where she ends up with either her heart on her sleeve or wishing she had kept her mouth shut! Her family is a hoot, so are her work issues. I am smiling just thinking back to some of the funniest bits.  I'll go ahead and say it, I wanna be BFFs with Emma!<br /><br />If you are looking for something funny, this is it. If you love reading Evanovich, give Kinsella a try!  If you just enjoy lighthearted situations and 'Cinderella' types of dreams, I really think you will like Can You Keep A Secret.  Which of us has not been in a situation where we maybe felt we had shared a little too much about ourselves??!! Emma sure has :0)
030726999X|5.0|The last of Steig Larsson's \\"The Girl....\\" books, keeps up the pace and fascination with a character who is probably the most interesting I've encountered in fiction.

All of her cunning and fierce determination are necessary to defeat a menace involving her family and the highest levels of the Swedish government.

Rush helped get my son into the 'real' music of my time and inspired him to take up drums.  The trio makes more sound both live and in studio than most 6 piece bands could ever hope for.  I look forward to their next tour as well as their next work of pure art!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I love this game because it's Non linear completely wide open and every time you play is different. also dev is constantly updating the app as well as occasionally adding new features and upgrades. definitely upgrade to full version to get the most out of the app and replayability, totally worth two bucks for the amount of time you will spend loving this game.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|It is so weird now because of the ability to \\"hear\\" the album on the internet months before the release.  But in this case,,,,it kept making more and more EXCITED about this evolving creation she was embarking on.  THIS is an AMAZING, PRESTINE, LUSH, album that could ONLY come Mrs. Gudmondottir. Oh BJORK, i am so proud of her this time...Volta was a mistake...i really wanted to like it and still do like some songs, but when she works primarily by herself, the results are superior.  Vespertine is still THE MASTERPIECE. But i think this is definitely a close 2nd.  I wish i could enjoy the apps, but i don't have one of those i-things or an expensive cell phone, so the album will be all for now...which is just fine!  GREAT WORK here.  Wow, Kate Bush, Florence, Annie Clark(St, Vincent) all in the same 2 month period.  It is either feast or famine.  I sure am ready for the feast of brilliance that is about to grace our ears.

This ward of the state, abused and highly suspicious and someone who has literally dropped out of most of regular life, is a genius and clever sleuth whose lifeline is as a researcher for a Swedish security firm.<br /><br />She gets mixed up with Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter who has to take time off following a libel suit and hires himself out to an industrialist who wants him to solve a four decades old family murder mystery.  It is a good ride as these two unlikely partners unravel an industrial/family mystery that is well drawn enough to keep the reader guessing for a good part of the book.<br /><br />The pacing is taught, the characters well defined and Salander has plenty of shocking and disturbing incidents which she must overcome in one of the most exciting books I've read in a while.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|I've read the reviews and I've listened to the petty complaints, so I finally decided to buy this set and formulate my own opinion. Before I disclose my findings, I'd like to say that I've enjoyed the music of Genesis since 1973 when I first heard the &#34;Genesis Live&#34; album. From there the whole thing snowballed to &#34;Selling England By The Pound&#34; and then &#34;Nursery Cryme&#34; and finally &#34;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.&#34; Unfortunately, after that one Gabriel moved on and with very few exceptions the fun was over (for me at least). So I've always maintained a fondness for the Gabriel years; from my perspective they embodied the true spirit of the band. With that said, it should be mentioned up front that this box set is THE definitive release for fans of early Genesis: the artwork, lyrics, photos and even the disc graphics are faithfully reproduced in all their bizarre glory. In addition, the newly remastered sound is absolutely stunning; my favorite example of this stellar difference is on the &#34;Selling England by the Pound&#34; CD---without a doubt the best version of this classic album that I've ever heard---it actually rivals the newly remastered version of &#34;In the Court of the Crimson King&#34;. I've carefully listened to all the CDs in this set and have found them to be superior to any other previous releases. Yes, there are a few subtle differences in the mix, but IMO they don't detract from the listening experience. Also included is a bonus disc of rarities which contains some interesting tidbits. Throw in the extensive selection of videos and interviews and you've got one of the most interesting, comprehensive, high quality box sets that I've ever had the pleasure of owning. ***** starsis kinda like having your vision corrected to 20/20 after being legally blind all your life and then complaining because the tint of the new lenses is a slightly different color. Also included is a bonus disc of rarities which contains some interesting snippets and a couple of pretty good songs, too. Throw in the extensive selection of videos and interviews and you've got one of the most interesting, comprehensive, high quality box sets that I've ever had the pleasure to own. I would send these out as Christmas gifts if I had Oprah's money, but unfortunately I'm just a poor working slob so I'll just have to burn copies to send to my friends (you know who the hell YOU are!) So... either BUY THIS BOX SET or continue to schlep along with whatever other crappy version of these albums you may have...whatever. But don't blame me when you're on your deathbed trying to remember the chorus to \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" and all you can come up with is \\"we are the one...\\" Too late, bucko!

B002NOYX54|5.0|The CD/DVD combination is great.  DVD gives a background of the history of the making of the album.  Is great but I was hoping that the DVD was video of all the songs on CD - as that is the best part of what I saw on You Tube- loved the clips and feel it made the music all the more special.
0553801473|4.0|If you're reading the series, you will read this book and you will swallow the bitter pill that it doesn't take us quite where (or as far) as we expected, and you will probably still be there ready for more when Winds of Winter comes out.  I found this one a little less engaging, a little sluggish, and a little more frustrating in terms of story arc.  It's still a very good book, and it still continues one of my favorite series.  The real test will now be if Winds of Winter can pick up the pace and re-engage me in the characters and the story as the previous books did.  If you were already struggling with the series, then this one might be your last.  Or you might tell yourself that, anyway.  When the next volume does come out, I'll wager it'll be hard not to pick it up to see where all this set-up is leading us...

B0054YIQK8|5.0|I had almost worn out my old VHS version of this remarkable production.  When I saw it was newly available on Blu-Ray, I couldn't wait to buy it.  Julia Migenes-Johnson is riveting, and the fact that this was filmed in Ronda and Seville brings the story back to settings originally conceived by Mérimée. The new subtitles are much more reliable than the older ones.  And the Blu-Ray process makes it possible to experience much more detail.  I will treasure this disc until it wears out!

B003F3NEBG|5.0|This version is so authentic and beautiful.  Colin Firth is so sexy as Mr. Darcy.  All the actors did a fabulous job.  Having the mini-series format makes it easy to view in episodes at your conveniece.  Highly recommended.

B000I8ES5C|4.0|Very cool. Really funny and fun to watch. Foreign films are not usually my forte but when it's this good it's worth watching in any language. I will say it is funnier in English(don't have to stop it every once in a while). Still it's a 4 Star to me.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Wow, what to say?  I am an avid fan of Mr. King's, and I enjoyed this short story.  However, not everyone is going to like this.    I found the car to be a brilliant reminder of Christine, From a Buick 8, but also Mrs. Todd's Short Cut.  In fact, I kept wondering if perhaps it had belonged to someone who took one of Mrs. Todd's short cuts.  The children and the shenanigans of the lead character is going to seriously put off some people.  Mr. King always tries to find truth in the children he portrays, and some people can't seem to take that.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A good documentary should either teach its audience about something new about a topic that is well known (like Restrepo educating the audience about the was in Afghanistan) or reveal to them about something that is not known at all (like the Cove does with the slaughter of dolphins in Japan).  This movie manages to do both - it educates its audience about something that is well known (the economic collapse) and reveals the causes of the collapse.<br /><br />This is a must see documentary for anyone that wants to become a better educated citizen.  The collapse of the global economy, the effects of which are being felt more than 3 years later, is, along with 9/11, the defining event of a generation.  You need to understand those events to be an informed citizen - this movie provides that understanding.<br /><br />Many books have been written about the financial collapse, but none explains it as lucidly and comprehensively as Inside Job.  Narrated by Matt Damon, coupled with interviews with many of the behind the scenes players in the bailout (the key players like Paulson, Cheney, Greenspan, Bush, etc. all declined to be interviewed), the movie paints a vivid image of the greed, negligence and immorality that is so pervasive in Wall Street.<br /><br />If you aren't angry by the time this movie is over, then you clearly weren't paying attention or don't care about the world's economic future.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Having decided to move into the next stage of shooting from fully automatic, I did a quick websearch to see what books were recommended.  This book seemed to come up again and again.  Now I know why ! In simple terms it gives you a really good understanding of how all those manual settings can effect the final outcome of your photos. That coupled with the example pictures, with explanations of the challenges and how to overcome them, this book has helped me immensely.   I ordered the Kindle version and while it's great to read the text and you can quite clearly see the photo's  albeit in B/W  , to fully appreciate the book you really need to read it on a colour device, like a tablet or a desktop/notebook.   Now to get out there and put some of this stuff into practice.  Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended!
B005U9RQNU|5.0|I held off on Breaking Bad for a while, because I didn't think I could get into a show that revolves around meth.  After seeing the first few episodes I was hooked (like \\"Lost\\" hooked).  It took me about a week and a half to get caught up from episode 1. The show is executed perfect. This was the best season finale ever, full closure. In all honesty, I believe this should've been the series finale.  I honestly don't know how they're going to follow this.
B004EPZ00W|5.0|\\"Moneyball,\\" directed by Bennett Miller with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, is based on the Michael Lewis bestseller of the same name.  Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, a once promising young ballplayer who never made it in the big leagues.  Now he is the general manager of the Oakland A's, a team that is about to lose its best players.  With a budget that will not allow Beane to compete financially with more prosperous teams, Beane hires a twenty-five year old Yale graduate named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics major who has come up with a unique computer program.  According to Brand, Beane can make the A's competitive in spite of their minuscule payroll.<br /><br />Some critics have said that you don't need to love or understand baseball to appreciate \\"Moneyball.\\"  This is true only to the extent that anyone can appreciate fine acting.  Pitt is relaxed and understated; he expresses emotional pain and frustration with facial expressions as much as with he does with words.  He is a divorced dad who cherishes the limited time he spends with his daughter.  Although Beane is in his forties, he has enough self-confidence and chutzpah to tell his grizzled scouts (all wonderful veteran character actors) that he is the one calling the shots.  Hoffman plays the A's manager, Art Howe, with his usual expertise.  Howe has thinly veiled contempt for what he considers to be a hare-brained scheme, but is professional enough to do what he is told.  Jonah Hill is terrific as Brand, a young, overweight man with a constant look of terror on his face, as if he expects to be thrown out of the office at any moment.  Why does Beane put it all on the line in this outrageous manner?  He says, \\"I hate losing more than I love winning,\\" and for some reason, Brand's ideas resonate with him.<br /><br />The script is an unsentimental and straightforward account of what happened in the 2002 season, when the A's won an unprecedented twenty games in a row.  \\"Moneyball\\" does not leave us with the notion that Brand's method is foolproof, since if it were, the A's would have continued their winning ways indefinitely.  Instead, this film is a character study of a courageous man who risked not only his position but also the derision of his more experienced colleagues by making a series of unconventional moves.  Beane and Brand had the temerity to suggest that although money is certainly needed to buy first-rate talent, it is sometimes possible to field a winning team without breaking the bank.e notion that Brand's method is foolproof, since if it were, the A's would have continued their winning ways indefinitely.

B002HFP0R4|2.0|If ever there was a group who needed to divide their historical recording output by era it is the Bee Gees.  Trying to mix wonderful songs like First of May and Words in with Barry's awful falsetto on his dicso hits is a travesty and makes the first disc unlistenable.  At the very least, all discs need to be in chronological order.  Barry you should have kept your falsetto in the closet.  Awful songs like Country Woman and On Time really hurt Maurice's disc.  Maybe if Maurice were alive to choose his own songs it would have turned out better.  Surprisingly, Robin's is by far the strongest disc -- really terrific and is in chronological order.  Great disc and it would have been even better if it included more solo hits by Robin.  And sorry Andy, but you only have 2 decent songs (and those were written by your older brother).  I love the Bee Gees but this is a wasted opportunity.  Their first box set is a little better (at least the first 2 discs) but only goes through 1991 and missed some great stuff.  Disc 3 and Disc 4 of the first set are horrible.  You can get my Mythology Box cheap at the used record store.
B004TO3UZK|2.0|With this mouse you are paying more than average in order to get a mouse that is ergonomically conscious. One good thing is your hand is sideways in more natural position.  However, they missed a very BASIC requirement of a sideways hand position.  They should have incorporated a contoured base to rest your hand. This is also missed in nearly any mouse since you have to support your hand by resting your hand on the work surface. But this problem is worsened with a sideways hand position. This type of mouse needs a contoured tray to rest the side of your hand in so that your hand doesn't drag on the table.   Was a support tray left out in order to save money? Or to keep the mouse smaller for convenience? At first glance, you can see they simply took the worn out, poorly designed mouse that we have used for years, and put it on its side...that's all.

0062011847|2.0|I have never before been disappointed in a book by Terry Pratchett, but this book is a disaster.  In fact, I don't believe that Pratchett wrote it.  The style changes at least three times during the progress of the story and the \\"voices\\" of the most settled and familiar characters are entirely different than they were in many previous novels.  I'm referring in particular to Lady Sybil and Willikins whose persona in both cases has undergone a complete change.  Lady S is now and suddenly an arch and unpleasant scold, rather than a supportive and never socially ambitious wife.  Willikins instead of a very formal and proper man's man in this book is a street tough at all times rather than only in times of war or conflict.  To say this is disconcerting is a vast understatement.  The English rhythms of speech; the colloquial usage of words and the over wordiness of the descriptions are alien and clang unpleasantly on the ear.  I don't know who composed this book, but they should never do so again.
B002HK9IDQ|2.0|Everyone with this movie often focuses on the whole Aubrey verses Julie controversy. Should Audrey Hepburn have been in it? Should she have used her own voice? That's all good and fun and important questions. What drives me insane however isn't Hepburn at all, but Rex Harrison. He has most of the songs and he ISN'T SINGING!!!!! Give me a pitched! Just once! PLEASE!!! I never know if I'm listening to a musical number or not because the dang man won't sing. So I can't hum along with any of these songs and get them stuck in my head because as far as I've ever heard, they don't have melodies. I'm not sure why this never gets brought up, but to me it seems this is a musical without music. It's like telling me the movie is in color and then it's all in black and white or telling me that the movie is a scary movie and giving me a chick flick instead. Get a main cast who can sing/are allowed to sing.  Oh, and change the ending. That part stunk!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I haven't play neither Ico and Shadow of Colossus on the the PS2.. I just purchased the collection and Iam really shocked how intelligent, deep, and artistic those two games are.. In fact Ico, it is the best videogame I have ever played... It was an emotional journey to an unbelieveable unreality world, and the same time you feel like you are in this castle... Never a game touched my emotions so gently and deeply as Ico.. This game its difficult to describe, and others in other reviews they have already done it..I just want to say, if haven't play these games buy the collection NOW!! Its a very special game!  Shadow of Colossus is also a very well-crafted game, with fantastic enviromens and very interesting gameplay. I enjoyed it very much, but I fell in love with ICO, so I want to focus there..  Anyway, team ICO is the best, Iam so impatient for their new game, \\"The last guardian\\"  Thank you very much mr Fumito Ueda for making so different, emotional, and intelligent games!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I saw this and I heavily enjoyed it. It stayed as true to the comics as it possibly could. But the reason think a lot of people hated it was because they had expectations so high that this movie had no chance of reaching it. Green Lantern is a beloved DC hero, after the success of the new Batman movies. Fans have made that the standard. Problem is Dark Knight had raised the bar that not even the upcoming sequel can reach let alone this.  Now to the actual movie, yes this movie had its flaws. Yes too many origins in one, yes not enough scenes in Oa. But when they did show the planet, it was amazing which was expected and not just those scenes. The special effects of the entire film were great as well. Ryan Reynolds did what we all had hoped...give us a live action Hal Jordan worth remembering. Plot was what you expect but good for anyone who hasnt read a green lantern comic  Ill give my full review when I watch the bluray  Pros:  -Special effects  -Mid credits scene  -Scenes on Oa  -Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan  Cons:  -Everyone's expectations ruined the film  -Not enough scenes of Oa  -Too many origins

0439023521|2.0|I may take some slack for this but I did not overly enjoy this book. I got bored with it to be honest and didn't really feel anything towards any of the characters. Katness annoyed me a lot of the time and I kind of got sick of hearing about how Peta didn't really love her etc.. I got the point the first 50 times she said it.<br />I felt the story was a good idea but I felt the only thing that was really well described was the food. Yeah, Hunger games I get that but I didn't feel like I was ever there with the characters.<br />I my read the last two I already have them but they aren't at the top of my list to read.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games<br />By: Suzanne Collins<br />(Given four stars for violence and a few other little things here and there.)<br /><br /> I knew the book was popular and apparently really good, but there are a lot of books that are supposedly really good.  When I walked into the library, I wasn't sure what I was looking for; then The Hunger Games came to mind.  And as I searched on the library website, every book copy was already checked out and/or was on hold multiple times by other people.  That's when I checked out a copy of The Hunger Games on audio book and it did not take me long at all to finish it.<br /><br />As the story began, it soon drew me in and held me there.  Suzanne's way of writing is, in a way, straight to the point and doesn't need a lot of frills to make it exciting.  However, she executes her story in an entertaining way so it's not dry or lacking.  She does a magnificent job of continuing the plot along as she steps back now and then to bring into light the characters' pasts.  I felt like I knew them and I understood why they were the way they were and why they acted like they did.  I wasn't a stranger to them like in some books where you have no idea what's wrong with the main characters' heads.<br /><br />However, I knew there was going to be bloodshed, and I feared it would be too graphic for me.  Though the circumstances are harsh and the teenagers are fighting each other to the death, the story is not void of love, which begins to entwine itself into the lives of the main characters, and at times even pity and sorrow.  Though some of the ending scenes in The Hunger Games were probably the worst yet, as far as violence goes, I finished the book and would read it again.<br /><br />The story is definitely left with some open endings, which is reasonable since there are books to follow it, but the story is not left at a confusing end where you don't understand what has happened.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I was sad that the thrill and adventure was over, but that only makes me more eager to read the second one and return to the Districts again to see what happens next...  If you want to know what it's all about, why so many people are trying to get their hands on this book, then pick it up and see for yourself.  Don't forget to hold on tight, because this book is going to take you on a ride you won't forget.read the second one and return to the Districts again to see what happens next...

0230013880|5.0|This book is nicely done, nice rhyming pattern and beautiful illustrations. The story is an important one, as it shows that those who are small are important to those who are big, and vice versa.  We all need each other and all have something to offer each other.  A timely book that helps kids see why everyone is important.

0385738773|3.0|*Warning -- potential spoilers below.  You have been warned.*  I struggled with this book.  On the one hand, it's a good read.  Fast, page-turner.  I couldn't set it down, and arrived at work today tired for lack of sleep.  Curse you, James Dashner!    In each installment of this series, we get to see more of the world around Thomas and his companions.  From the insular maze in the opening pages of \\"Maze Runner\\" to now, our view of the world has slowly pulled back.  We can see more.    Really, this is interesting stuff.  So THIS is how the rest of world is dealing with the zombie apocalypse! (And let's not kid ourselves, that's basically what this is about).  There are answers, finally.  But not enough.  I don't mind stories that are full of questions.  I don't mind characters and groups with plots so thick, with so many twists and turns you'd need an entire fourth book just to explain it.  But it got tiresome.  Not a single character can make any kind of decision whatsoever without another character asking \\"But what if that's what WICKED *wants* us to do!\\"  And finally, when we get to the truth...  ...  ...  ...except we never really do.    Thomas never does get his memories back.  Hints are dropped that he was a mastermind of the whole thing, but we'll never know.  What a wonderful struggle that would have been, as old-Thomas and new-Thomas tried to reconcile what one had planned and the other had experienced.  Now THAT would have been interesting.  Alas, it was not to be.  Other characters do choose to recover their memories, but that's essentially the last time the reader sees any of them.  Sure, they show up at the end, but they show up just to show up, or to get killed off.  Not to tell anyone what happened.  Not to offer insight into the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of WICKED.  Just to show up.  For all the fuss that was made about them getting their memories back (if they actually did get them back, that is, and not just some fabricated recollections of WICKED), when we do see them again, I'm not sure it really makes any difference.  They certainly don't seem to contribute to the final solution, really.  And speaking of the final solution... the final Death Cure... the ultimate responce to the Flare...  I don't want to call it a deus ex machina, but I'll gladly give a shiny new dime to the person who can tell me exactly where it is that Thomas and the others ultimately end up.  I realize I've been critical.  Perhaps unfairly so.  As a whole, the Maze Runner trilogy is a solid tale.  I do not regret purchasing the books, and they shall -- for a time at least -- take up space on my bookself.    My biggest issue is that Dashner has created a story that evokes a great deal of mystery.  The first two books weave a story that is intriguing not only in its own right, but also because of what is left in the dark.    My criticism is this:  the final book of such a story must bring that hidden portion to light.  Not necessarily all of it, but enough so that we, the readers, can have that moment when we look up from the page and go \\"Oooooohhhhhh!  Now I get it!\\"  Maybe I missed it.  But for me, that moment never came.

However, my book group selected it and I'm glad we did.  I didn't know about France's collaboration with the Nazi's in the rounding up the the Jewish families nor the children's separation from parents and later deaths.  This book is well-written and engaging, and full of historic information as well.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin's final book in the series is as wonderfully written as all the others.  It keeps you captivated from beginning to end.  You never want it to end, but the ending is enough to have some semblance of closure.  I really enjoyed this series and am sad that it is over.
0385738765|4.0|Picking up from where the Maze Runner left off, the Scorch Trials begins with Thomas waking up in a dormitory, the place where his rescuers from the maze had delivered them. Within a short period of time, he and his fellow Gladers from the maze are sent through a portal by WICKED (the people controlling these trials). Thomas and all the Gladers are then instructed by one of WICKED's members that they are to be sent in a barren and hot wasteland that earth has become because of severe and unexpected solar flares. They have two weeks to travel 100 miles across the destroyed land. He continues to explain that they have caught a deadly disease called the Flare, and it will slowly take over their minds and bodies until they go insane and eventually die. However, if they make it in two week's time to the safe haven, they will receive a cure for it from WICKED. The reader continues to follow Thomas as he tries to understand the purpose of WICKED and its trials, and watches them take on this seemingly impossible challenge. No one knows the dangers that lie ahead. There is little hope. Their chances are slim. Do they have the will and the determination to survive?     To me, one of the most intriguing factors of the book was listening to everything going on inside Thomas' mind, and hoping that he makes it through. Thomas is a very likeable character, and it is easy to understand what he is suffering from and you feel like you can relate to him. Since it is brilliantly written from Thomas' perspective, it seems as if you are in the novel experiencing all these events and going through the emotional pain. If he was in pain, I felt as if I was suffering as well. If Thomas was confused, I had followed his thought process and was confused too. Without this feeling of understanding for the protagonist, the Scorch Trials wouldn't be half as entertaining as it is.    To all who enjoyed this book, I would largely recommend the Alex Rider series by Anthony Horowitz. The Alex Rider books are all about a teenage boy named Alex Rider who is recruited by MI6 in England. There is a new mission in every book that MI6 sends him on, and they use him because his young age gives him the advantage of disguise. This series also has an ongoing love story similar Thomas' from the Scorch Trials. Fans of the Scorch Trials will enjoy these because of the constant action partnered by the curiosity to discover what is truly happening, and wanting to understand the evil plan behind it all. Just like Scorch Trials as well, the reader quickly develops a liking for the protagonist, Alex Rider.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book, considering it is difficult for a teenager like me to actually sit down and be interested in a book. The plot was fantastic, and it was a great follow-up to the first book. It was in no way a disappointment. Only two things bothered me about the Scorch Trials. The first was that it seemed very repetitive at times. I found myself feeling a bit frustrated when I was waiting for something interesting to happen but instead I read nothing but Thomas repeating the same questions or thoughts within his mind. Also, I feel like James Dashner could've worked on spreading information a little more. Some areas of the book were beautifully written and stocked with new, engaging information, while others were too stretched out and became monotonous. A few sets of chapters here or there were rather boring. The Scorch Trials was a fantastic book; however, it didn't astound me or anything radical. I look forward to reading the last book of the series; The Death Cure.
B004X1FO8K|5.0|Eckhart Tolle stands uniquely in our time and sees exquisitely.  His book amplifies the central message from Power of Now and gives us greater resources to both see and work with the basic unconsciousness we all share because of our identification with form of any kind: our body, our thoughts, our repetitive self-defeat cycles, the pain-body, emotions.  He very gently affirms the natural state of who we are and shows us how to reach it in the silence of the Observer, thus breaking bit by bit our connection with ego's unconsciousness.  A thoroughly superlative support for those of us seeking why and how to move in partnership toward creating a New Earth.

Usually...on previous Lee Child...Jack Reacher novels I have always been surprised in the end to find out what I've missed.  Not with this one.  I was very disappointed when I finished the book and it ended the way it did.  I saw that coming before I got even halfway done with the book...as soon as Senator Riley was introduced into the picture...and there was already mention made of his son.  I frequently will read up to the final 4-5 chapters...then I let it sit for a few days and think about everything to see if I could piece something together...I've never been right.  I was firmly convinced that someone other than the Riley's...or someone in addition to the Riley's were going to be a key part to this book...but...nope...no one else emerged. In my opinion defintely not one of Lee's better efforts.
B0001906O0|5.0|Here's a material list of the components within this Boxed Set:<br /><br />- 4 Discs; Disc 1: 1978-1987, Disc 2: 1987- 1992, Disc 3: 1992- 1996, Disc 4: 1996- 2001.<br /><br />- 70 tracks in Total<br /><br />- 69 page book that includes dozens of photos, a quasi-biography, excerpts from interviews with Robert and Simon, and an essay by Johnny Black.<br /><br />- All comes packaged in a sturdy, hardcover book-like jacket.<br /><br />Join The Dots is, perhaps, the most far-reaching collection of career- spanning material ever released by a commercial artist. It is certainly the most ambitious endeavor The Cure has released over their expansive 30+ year career. For the first time, every B-Side (all 48 of them!), every contribution made to a film soundtrack, and all other unreleased tracks are made available on the CD format in this four-disc package. In total, there are 70 tracks to feast your ears on for months to come. More important and ultimately more satisfying than any regular album from The Cure, this massive compilation is Crucial for fans of this legendary band.<br /><br />For someone my age, this box set is a godsend. I was born in 1987, which means that the majority of this material was released before I was born or when I was only a little kid.  At the time of purchasing this item, I owned six of their albums and two DVDs; a pretty large and effective representation The Cure's accomplishments, I thought. The four discs that make up Join The Dots, however, are just as representative of everything The Cure stands for as all of those albums and DVDs. The Cure has always taken the creative high road by never pandering to the Mainstream audiences, but simply writing and releasing the material that pleased them. The music in this collection reveals even more of that creativity and originality that has been vital to the band's long term success. Even if you're already a devout admirer, as I am, I think you will develop a higher level of respect and love for The Cure after you experience the music on these discs. They really are that good!<br /><br />If you're a dedicated fan, then you know most of their best songs were never released as singles. I'm sure this is why I found that the majority of the B-sides are a bit more musically and lyrically mature and compelling than the better known A-sides. This trait is especially true for the First and Fourth discs. The Cure's A-sides didn't start matching the quality of the B-sides until they released \\"The Head on the Door\\". For me, the Second and Third discs are the best. All the characteristics you love about this band will be strongly reinforced on these two discs.<br />To conclude, I must reiterate how essential the music on these discs truly is. No matter how well you think you know The Cure's world, you must have this. You will be truly surprised that just one band was capable of creating so much material. Until I bought this boxed set, I never knew how much music I was missing from them. I hadn't a clue that they had so much music out there, waiting to be discovered. I'm sure this is probably the case with many of you, as well.eally are that good!   If you're a dedicated fan, then you know most of their best songs were never released as singles.

0553801473|2.0|This book is a short novella masquerading as a bloated tome.  It desperately needs harsh and impartial editing.<br /><br />Even if you like the series, you can skip this one in favor of reading the spoilers in the reviews here.  Or perhaps just read the last 150 pages to get the cliffhangers, but they aren't really cliffhangers since their outcomes have been so heavily foreshadowed you know what will happen.

B004HHKFIY|5.0|Like most preschoolers, My 3 year old son caught the disney channel's Chuggington's Frenzy. We love the wooden train's line. The colors and details are pretty cool and seem durable. It has been dropped a few times on hard surfaces without any issues. All in All, the trains are a great toy.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating, is the compatablility issues with the Thomas/Brio/ Imaginarium sets. First of all, the chuggington's are bigger and bulkier, and take up most of the width of the tracks. The magnetic couplings are uneven and mismatched; the thomas train's upper part of the magnet would be just touching the lowest part of the chuggington's magnet, but they do still couple, and fit on the track. The Bridges however are the real problem. Chuggington's trains are also much taller and will not fit in the tunnels, or overpasses, or bridges for that matter which is extreamely frusterating to not only the kids, but also the parents who alreay invested alot of money in the thomas tracks. The only soulution is since all the tracks are compatable to piece together, is to make sure you buy some Chuggington ramps, bridges, and overpasses so all the trains can be played with together.

0385534639|5.0|Rarely do I want to gush about a book or talk about it to all I meet (I am a Librarian)....this is one of those rare books! I cannot stop thinking about it or wanting to share it with others.  What an amazing story. I was hooked from the first sentence. The first half is a bit slow, but I can unerstand the need to build the world of the circus. The second half of the book is awe inspiring with it's descriptions of the circus tents and all of the individual nuances of the preformers.  I love love LOVED this book! The Night Circus is an adventure that you should not miss. A grown up Harry Potter.  I will be reading this again....and again.  Bravo Ms Morgenstern. I cannot wait to see what you give us next.

B0058WFO06|5.0|For anyone who feels that great music is no longer being made - this is the one to own.  Even after 2 listens I *know* that this album is on the same level as any album you might find on 'Greatest Album' lists.   I know Stevens work well (including obscure works) and I can hear that even though his work is of a high quality anyway that he has created his masterpiece. This stands above anything he has done before and is happily rubbing shoulders with any great album of any classic period you care to mention. The nicest thing about this album is that it is going to show more detail and grow on me with repeated listenings.  US$10 is also a VERY reasonable price for something of this quality.

0307887898|4.0|This book is a good introduction to the Lean Startup approach to building and launching products for new markets. This book draws upon numerous works that have addressed the dynamics of new markets, discovering what customers really want, fact-based decision making and lean manufacturing. What is interesting is the way Lean Startup brings these ideas together into a cohesive and powerful framework. A framework built around a fundamental insight: building a new products for a new market should be considered a high risk experiment. Or rather, a series of experiments that successively prove (or disprove) whether we are building products that customers actually want. So, make assumptions explicit, test them vigorously, learn, repeat. Iterate through this loop as quickly as possible by deploying cross functional teams that build the product in small batches.   I have launched new products at startups and established companies. I have lived through the dysfunction of silo-ed teams guessing what customers want and then investing in long development cycles before they find out the truth, if ever. So personally, I find Lean Startup ideas appealing and at least worth attempting.   Teams that have gone through the process of adopting agile and lean for software engineering will recognize many of the rationales and principles laid out on this book. They will also realize that they implemented those principles too narrowly to be truly effective. Limiting lean and agile practices to just product engineering does not solve the dysfunction in other areas that are equally important for market success.  My concern is whether this approach will doom teams to only make small incremental improvements that can be readily tested. Will it stifle intuition and courage to make big, bold decisions? Will 'let's test it' become a crutch for people who don't have the guts to make a call based on incomplete information (and information needed for big decisions will always be incomplete)? Time will tell. The Lean Startup movement is still in it's early days.   I should point out that the book lacks specific ideas on how to implement the Lean Startup approach. The book has several high level stories, but very few methods, techniques and practices that can be readily implemented. This can be a bit frustrating if you are trying to imagine what Lean Startup ideas look like in action. Ries explains why specifics are missing at the very end of the book. The Lean Startup approach itself is an experiment! It is in its early stages and there is a lot of learning needed to implement it in a repeatable fashion. Further, the emphasis on learning means that any existing method should be continuously questioned, improved or even transformed. Ries says he does not want the movement to be reduced to a set of prescribed methods and tactics. Instead, he recommends joining a community of practitioners to learn how to implement Lean Startup ideas.  Another ding against this book is a chapter on how established companies can nurture innovation. Ries feels out of his element on this topic and puts forth a series of that either value or akin to motherhood and apple pie. But it doesn't matter, because this book is really for technology start-ups. And for them it does put forth some fundamentally insightful ideas that will make any entrepreneur pause and reconsider the traditional approach.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|My pulse was so fast from the tension on this episode that it woke up my cat. The Breaking Bad team put together a brilliant story on a simple stage with a handful of great talent. Story arcs launched from all throughout the series converge at the very end of this episode with a spectacular impact.<br />This isn't an action-packed star-speckled explosion-fest. It's a carefully designed story based on a reasonable premise in a clear, unvarnished voice. What could be next?
B002W1UEW4|1.0|WOW. I loved GI Joe back in the day and was expecting to love this even if it was cheesy and over the top and maybe not in the same character as the original series, but WOW. Nothing can ruin a beloved memory like the time honored trifecta of utterly cheap and unbelievable CGI, horrible acting, and cheesy plot. Forget character development, out of date stereotypes reign supreme beyond what you would expect for a modern rendition without the addition of any character depth. I had trouble enjoying all the action due to the dollar store CGI along with the flat humor and played out dialogue. Not to mention a serious imbalance between Joe luck and baddie luck. I'm not the type, but as the movie dragged on I started rooting for the baddies because all of the Joes' improbable stunts which culminated not only in my inability to suspend disbelief, but actual annoyance during every fight sequence. Why would an arms mastermind just happen to leave an ultra fast jet unlocked with no antitheft system or even a simple key in his hangar that jusssssst so happened to be 1 mach faster than the missiles he planned his whole world domination plot around? Why, after that long scene with the cobra demonstrating that nanobotted baddie grunts don't feel pain, would a ninja star to the eye even phase one, let alone cause him to scream out in pain and stagger back? Why did the warheads seem to attack Ripcord's plane slower than all else and somehow leave him and his ejector seat and parachute unaffected? Even if he had ejected from a dissolving plane, some part of his helmet, seat, chute, and probably him should have dissolved too! At least a LITTLE! *Sigh* These inconsistencies and the constant feeling that the Joes had no rules, be them natural or those previously established in the movie, made the entire thing thoroughly annoying. There's just no way I could have imagined this being so bad and so untrue to its origins. Maybe they forgot that making a live action movie out of a cartoon doesn't mean you direct live actors like cartoons and cartoonify all your CGI. I would rather watch the cartoon.esn't mean you direct live actors like cartoons and cartoonify all your CGI. I would rather watch the cartoon.

B005JU5JTI|3.0|I love Cameron Diaz. Justin Timberlake is a pretty good actor in my opinion, as well as Jason Siegel. In fact there are a lot of good actors/characters in this movie. I think the problem is probably with the director/editor? The timing of everything seemed a little off so that what could've been a much better movie was just ok. It was hard to get through the beginning, it is a cute story- just off the way it was directed.

A lot less street racing and nice cars in this film, a lot more over-the-top action scenes and steroid-enhanced testosterone. Oh well, at least it was better than Tokyo Drift!<br /><br />Ranked in order of enjoyability:<br /><br />Fast and Furious (original)<br />Fast and Furious 4<br />Too Fast, Too Furious<br />Fast Five<br />Tokyo Drift<br /><br />It was kind of cool they brought some of the characters back from all the movies in the series but they kind of over did it I thought.

B0019UGYK0|5.0|Cool Hand Luke is the story of a unique individual who gains a following among the inmates while serving time in a Southern prison for a drunken act of vandalism.   An independent thinker, he kowtows to no authority, whether it be the Captain who is chief overseer of the prison, Carr the floor man of the prison barracks, or Dragline the burly leader of the inmates.    In his first few days at the prison, Luke manages to antagonize all three with his willfulness.  When his differences with Dragline escalate into a boxing match, Luke's refusal to surrender when beaten earns him Dragline's friendship and respect, which, in turn, raises his esteem among the other prisoners.    In time, Luke's spirit, which refuses to be chained by the conformity of prison life, and his selflessness, which causes him to sacrifice himself in order to entertain and educate his fellow inmates, make him a figure of admiration and affection within their ranks.  This does nothing to improve his lot with the prison authorities, who begin to look upon him as a rebel and a threat to the order of the establishment.  Among these authorities is the inscrutable \\"Man with No Eyes,\\" a figure of superhuman evil to the other inmates who is so named because of his impenetrable sunglasses, which is a mask that separates him from other men.  Although Luke is seemingly willing to \\"pay his debt to society\\" at first, the Captain's unjust restraint as a means to keep him from escaping to attend his mother's funeral provokes Luke into full rebellion.  His entire energy is then focused upon escaping the prison.  He escapes and is captured, and then escapes again.    The second time he is captured, the prison authorities torment him to break his spirit.  When he succumbs to their torture, the other inmates turn from him, seeing his capitulation as a personal betrayal.    Luke's surrender, however, is only temporary.  He dupes the authorities and escapes for a third time, with Dragline following him.  Luke, however, urges him to go his own way and experiences a personal Gethsemane in an abandoned church.  In the meantime, Dragline is captured and unknowingly becomes the Judas who alerts the authorities to Luke's hideaway.  Luke is shot by the prison authorities and Dragline, painfully aware that he has been used, attacks the \\"Man with No Eyes,\\" knocking the sunglasses from his face and breaking them.  We last see the \\"Man with No Eyes\\" stumbling and vulnerable, his mask destroyed.    We might deduce that Luke has died, since Dragline shares his memories of him, triumphant in defeat, with his fellow inmates.  Dragline now wears shackles on his feet, as Luke did after his first escape, a symbol of his affinity with this rebellious, independent, and freedom-loving martyr.

B003L77G6A|5.0|all the characters are evolving in different directions to keep the dynamics interesting.  After a dull introduction of the character,  Amy too has evolved rather slowly to establish her raison d'etre in the show. The relationship of Sheldon and Amy has developed thanks to Amy's evolution, not Sheldon's.  If anything, Sheldon is more pigeon-holed into his miniscule peculiarity, making his character less-lovable and predictable. I so wish to see Beverly, Leonard's mother, again.  She has been my favorite character.  Raj has some room to expand.  Perhaps we will see it happen in season 5.

B005S7GT32|5.0|Peter Gabriel is a genious when it comes to music. This album shows how he can reinvent old songs and make them into something more special. The only thing missing on this album are some of the other songs covered throughout his recent new blood tour like \\"Secret World.\\" The orchestra adds a new element to songs like \\"Intruder\\" and \\"San Jacinto.\\" The orchestra really controls both of those songs and there are some strong dynamics throughout. I've been a fan for a long time and Peter Gabriel always seems to find new ways to satisfy his audiences. I can't wait to see what he does next!

B0039M41X8|5.0|This album has got to be the best they've come out with in the last 10 years. And I thought that Unbreakable and Humanity were pretty good. Of course, I am a huge fan, so I have a biased opinion, but I think that most rock music lovers will swoon over this album. Beats the socks off of any album produced by the new muscians- and I'm young enough to know what the new music is. Yay for the Scorpions new album- refreshing music out of the dull music of today.
B004QNN1UI|4.0|Mick is as great as ever and the Simply Red band and backup singers are superb.

I prefer his DVD of the concert in Sicily made several years ago.
0062011847|5.0|Sir Terry (pTerry to his fans) Pratchett has come out with another masterpiece, this time combining a solid mystery, inventive humor, and of course one of the most original fantasy worlds yet- Discworld, where the world really is flat, and sits on the back of 4 humongous elephants riding on the back of a  planet sized turtle.<br /><br />It is part of the City Watch or Sam Vimes cycle, with that hard-boiled flatfoot (but now Commander) detective being confronted with yet another murder. Since most of the tale is not set in Ankh Morpork, we don't get a lot of the usual Watch characters, but of course Corporal Nobby is there, being very Baldrick-like.<br /><br />Still, we meet many old favorite characters, some of which were rather surprising, and some fun new characters are introduced. A somewhat new race- goblins- is fleshed out. Not the goblins you know, of course...<br /><br />From the books overleaf: \\"\\"According to the writer of the best-selling crime novel ever to have been published in the city of Ankh-Morpork, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a policeman taking a holiday would barely have had time to open his suitcase before he finds his first corpse. And Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is on holiday in the pleasant and innocent countryside, but not for him a mere body in the wardrobe, but many, many bodies and an ancient crime more terrible than murder. He is out of his jurisdiction, out of his depth, out of bacon sandwiches, occasionally snookered and occasionally out of his mind, but not out of guile. Where there is a crime there must be a finding, there must be a chase and there must be a punishment. They say that in the end all sins are forgiven. But not quite all...\\"<br /><br />One of Pratchetts best!!!<br /><br />(PS, read the interview here on this Amazon page, it's hilarious!)<br /><br />I have been told by reputable sources that there may be some issues with the Kindle version.

1466208686|5.0|You could be an outstanding software engineer and still not pass a coding interview at these top tech companies. College and work are not enough to prepare you. This book shows you what to expect, and then shows you what the interviewees are looking for. The first 50 pages or so are give you some overall strategies for your interview. The simple tips are invaluable. For example, start coding on the whiteboard on the upper left hand part of the board so that you have room.<br /><br />The remaining 250 pages are interview questions. There are 1000's of interview questions to select from. Still you have got to become familiar with the common ones. Everyone should learn the \\"maximal subarray\\", problem 19.7. Gayle has carefully selected very insightful 150 interview questions and broken them up into sensible categories.<br /><br />I have read over a dozen interview prep books. This is my favorite. I think you will like it.
1597801585|4.0|Where a good deal of futuristic settings are largely Western in origin, Bacigalupi breaks the mold and sets The Windup Girl in Thailand, exposing readers to a new culture, language, and set of experiences and values. My own compehension of Thai being limited to \\"sawatdi kha\\" and \\"mai pen rai,\\" I managed to expand my vocabulary a little simply by reading this book. It was, I must say, a welcome change from the white-bread, Western-dominated culture often expressed in futuristic settings.<br /><br />Also interestingly, while still being science fiction this book takes us back a few steps in terms of technology. The level of power that we enjoy even today is gone. Computers are run by treadles. It's borderline steampunk in that more things are made of cogs and gears, simply out of necessity. Humanity's control over the world has been decimated by crop failures, advanced disease, climate change. The whole Monsanto controvery is ramped up to 11 here by corporations taking control of all things edible, cracking the genetic code to make it resistant to all the blights and ills that killed crops previously, and making all the crops sterile so that people have to rely on them for food. Nobody can just take a handful of apple seeds and some land and start their own orchard.<br /><br />Almost makes you wish for the kind of future where we're just off exploring alien planets, doesn't it?<br /><br />The titular character of the novel, Emiko the windup girl, is interesting in that she's not the main character (though we do see a fair amount from her viewpoint, so it's fair to say that she's a protagonist) but more of a catalyst. Resigned at first to spending her life being degraded in the sex trade, Emiko's journey of self-discovery and -realization not only free her from sexual slavery but also serves as the jumping-off point for an entire political revolution in Thailand.

030788743X|4.0|For anyone who identifies as a good and who has fond memories of the 1980s and 1990s, then this is the book for you. Ready Player One combines modern gamer fiction with countless 80s and 90s pop culture references to leave you with a thrilling nostalgic ride through a futuristic virtual world.<br /><br />The world that Cline created is not an unfamiliar one. It assumes the rise of online gaming continues and that it eventually becomes, essentially, a reality in its own right, allowing for user education, commerce, interaction, all the stuff that we do in our day-to-day lives. It isn't surprising that the ultimate online gaming world in this book, the OASIS, is preferable to the real world that contains fuel and food shortages, rising violence, and an almost unprecedented level of corporate corruption.<br /><br />So when it's revealed that the dying wish of the creator of the OASIS is to hold a contest in the virtual world, and the winner gets his entire fortune, it's also no surprise that millions of people jump on the chance! The hero of the tale, Wade, is part of a group of people known as gunters, short of \\"egg hunters\\", who are looking for this Easter Egg hidden within the massive virtual world.<br /><br />Cline shows his skill here not necessarily with the fact that he build this world, but that he effectively used dozens of world that others before him built. From Star Wars to obscure tokusatsu shows, Cline took bits and pieces of various realities, mashed them together inside the concept of the OASIS, and then went to town with it. The result could have been utter chaos, but instead functioned well within fairly simple rules and guidelines that were not at all unbelievable to set up.<br /><br />Interestingly, this book was not a cautionary tale nor a glorious expression of love for online gaming and virtual interaction. Both sides of the coin are shown. On one hand, the virtual world allows for hours of entertainment for the masses, allows a virtual economy to affect the real world (when was the last time you paid your rent by slaying goblins, huh?), and a great chance for people to gain excellent educations regardless of their location. The classic negatives are presented here, too, by showing Wade gaining weight and becoming unhealthy from the sedentary lifestyle he leads while trying to win the contest, and there's the usual reaction of surprise when people find out that others look nothing like their avatars. But overall, the OASIS was presented as neither ideal or corrupt. It simply was, which was exactly what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />The never-ending hit of nostalgia I felt while reading this book was amazing, refreshing, and a load of fun. It's not a heavy read, though it does have its moments of being downright disturbing in places (the way a megacorporation has the legal right to essentially force people into slavery to repay their debts is one case that comes instantly to mind). It feels a lot like a game, if truth be told. Fun, action-packed, entertaining, but not without a large amount of the little details and depths that make such games stand apart from their rivals. As far as gamer fiction goes, this is one of the better reads, and I highly recommend you read it if you get the chance.<br /><br />And if you a don't, a grue will eat you.s the last time you paid your rent by slaying goblins, huh?), and a great chance for people to gain excellent educations regardless of their location.

0786956291|4.0|The Essentials Starter Set (Red Box) is a good starter for people who have never played D&D before.  It gives you a slow introduction to the game without giving you an information overload.  It does this by simultaneously helping you to create a character while also introducing a few of the game mechanics.  Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Red Box:  1. A set of 6 dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20).  Nothing wrong with this!  2. Character sheets.  These are simple Essentials character sheets, if you want more detailed ones search online for free ones (its not illegal).  3. Tokens.  Good:  Miniatures can be expensive; if you want to cut costs, collect as many of these guys as possible. (You get more in the DM Kit, the Monster Vault, and MV: Threats to Nentir Vale). Bad:  There aren't actually two sheets but rather one double-sided sheet to save space.  Typically tokens have a normal side and a \\"bloddied side;\\" on these there is a completely different monster.  Also, a few of these are repeated in the other token sets (but like I said collect as many as possible if you don't want to pay for minis).  4. The player booklet. Good: This is a nice little solo adventure in case you don't have anyone to play with yet.  The Red box also comes with a free download for another solo adventure so that is a plus. Ugly:  The worst part of the Red Box is that it does not give you all of the options for your characters. If you create the same character using the Red Box and then with Heroes of the Fallen Lands, you will realize that they are not exactly the same. The Red Box is good for people who don't know any better, but once you understand how to create characters, you will realize that the Red Box does it wrong.  It does not give you all the options (weapons, armor, powers, feats) available to your character, and, in the case of the Thief (Rogue), you are given attack powers in the Red Box that are not even an option in HotFL.  5. Power cards. Good:  There are 3 rougue utilities and three transmutation wizard powers that are not available in HotFL  Bad:  There are inconsistencies between some of the powers on the cards and in HotFL.  6. DM booklet and maps.  Good:  I have yet to play the adventure but it looks pretty cool for a first adventurer.  Also, it leads into the \\"Orcus\\" storyline of the H1-3, P1-3, and E1-3 adventures, if you are planning on taking that route.  Bad:  Only gives you the most basis rules for running a game.  You will need the Rules Compendium and/or the DM kit to run it properly.  Before you buy this product, you need to decide whether you want to play D&D 4E Essentials, D&D 4E, or D&D 3.5.  D&D 3.5 is outdated and out of print but still fairly popular and a lot of free content is available online.  When it come to the 4th edition, you have two choices:  the older version that has a lot more books directed towards it, or Essentials which is a little more up to date but is a little more simplified, but is also going to be the standard for most of the upcoming D&D products. The bottom line is that the Red Box gives you some nice extra things, but when it comes to starting out with D&D, any intelligent person can read the other Essentials books and figure out how to play the game just as easily as by reading the Red Box material.  However, I still like the product, as I have committed to buying the Essentials. 4 stars.

B00479SVBU|4.0|The manual says to locate a channel that is unused. We started out and the first slot itself worked fine. When I plugged this out, realized that there is an existing FM station on that frequency - though not very clear. The power of the device was good enough to avoid any interference from that station.  Very simple to operate - plug in an SD card into the transmitter and plug it into the car charger slot.   Issues are not too many and some are not really complaints.  1. It uses up a charger slot. Our car has 2 - one has the GPS and I used to have a phone charger in the second. This is now a permanent feature and so, I am short one charger. I know, this is not really a complaint, but wish it could also work on a battery.  2. The screen is small and distant as it has to be plugged into the charger port. Wish they had a charger wire and the device could be independent of where the charger slot is. This I think could be taken as an area to improve.   Overall, very happy with the purchase....

B0034G4P8A|4.0|Like many of my friends, I had written this movie off as just another testosterone-ridden-special-fx-flick for the comic-loving masses.(Ok, I admit, I love comics too). But I was surprised that after 20 minutes into the movie I was actually having a good time! It doesn't try to do anything too ambitious, but what it does do is entertain as a summer movie should. There's lots of special fx and nice battle scenes, and the pacing is spot-on. The subject matter is admittedly over-the-top (with the Norse mythological ties), but the movie doesn't take it too far. It keeps things in the \\"awesome-looking\\" category rather than the \\"campy\\" category more often than not. Portman does a good job as the over-enthusiastic scientist and Hemsworth does a surprisingly great Thor performance. Their interaction is just another thing that works well for the movie. If you plan to watch the up coming Avengers movie, you can consider this as required viewing - as it appears one of the key antagonists of the Avenger movie is the same one here. Action is fun, not bloody and overly violent - so I wouldn't have a problem taking a 8-12 year-old to watch this. There are no steamy love scenes either. My one gripe is I wish it were longer. The events that transpire in the movie seem like they were rather rushed.
B003WJ81MA|2.0|I was attracted to this movie because i like Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry and Ridley Scott. I didn't even know what it was about. i still don't. i didn't understand most of the film, it didn't make sense to me. i like fantasy films, but this movie completely lost me. Plus, the villain barely sounded or looked like Tim Curry. if it was him, i think his voice was digitally enhanced or something. Good song that play over the end credits, though.
0307887898|5.0|A must read !!!  I discovered the Lean startup movement a couple of months ago, I then pre-ordered Eric Ries' book and I have to say I'm not disapointed.  Eric Ries explained his Lean Startup movement in great details. He provides some examples of startup which succeeded and of others which failed with great analysis of the possible raison of those failures.  He builds a solid scientific approach to drive a startup (not limited to startup though) and to anticipate the mismatch between what you build and what the customer needs. The customer is set in the center of the picture and this vision should be adopted by a lot of entrepreneur who too often  build stuff to build stuff and thinking the customer will love it.

B0000026CN|5.0|BLUES FOR SALVADOR is credited as &#34;Carlos Santana&#34; album as opposed to a &#34;Santana&#34; (band) release, even though it appears chronologically during a late 80's somewhat dry spell utilizing most of Santana key personnel.  Originally released in late 1987 (October), the 80's had not been commercially or critically productive for Carlos and band.  Zebop! In '81 was the last strong effort and remained the best band album of the 80's.  SALVADOR however was a solid &#34;collection&#34; of some private memorabilia from Carlos, which is perhaps why it was released as a &#34;solo&#34; album, that and the fact that the musicians on the tracks were varied.  First of all the album as a whole was dedicated to his wife and spiritual partner (at the time) Deborah.  It boasts a song for his daughter (Bella) and the title track for his son Salvador, both of which are among the best tracks on the CD.  Bella especially is a beautiful (bella) new age jazz confection somewhat reminiscent of Andreas Vollenweider's early works; and Blues For Salvador is a terrific though typical Santana guitar instrumental, one of his best works.  The album did manage to garner Carlos his first ever Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the title track of course.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a melding of two very fine instrumental works Bailando/Aquatic Park before diving immediately into the rain forest imagery of Bella.  Bella is perhaps one of Santana's most gorgeous compositions ever, surreal and earthy at the same time, it begins bluesy and exploratory with Carlos and keyboardist Thompson weaving around each other.  Then it's a new agey Vollenweiderish &#34;choral&#34; piece thrown into the mix which carries you into a greenery of astonishing Brazilian rhythmes.  I'm Gone provides a neat uptown funk instrumental courtesy of the Philly sound with Carlos bending it around this way and that.  'Trane is his tribute to one of his heros of course, John Coltrane, who's widow Alice he worked with extensively in the early 70's.  Dig Deeper continues in the same vein as the previous two, and Mingus is a percussive short inspired by Charles Mingus, idol of all the Santana crew.  Now That You Know is a live recording which boasts some of the best instrumental combined effort of the crew, shame the recording is mono, but still highly enjoyable.  Hannibal is a reworking by the current crew of a track from Zebop!  What's to like is that it has an alternate, jazz club ending and there are some subtle differences as an alternate version of a track fans will enjoy.  Finally the album closes naturally enough with a Carlos blues guitar instrumental well deserving of the Grammy.  Again Chester Thompson's keys weave in and around his guitar like a dance between two highly sophisticated pair of hands.  Another of Santana's best by either band or man.widow Alice he worked with extensively in the early 70's.

B005NN4PPU|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of James Morrison. I have all three of his albums that have been released stateside. In a day when auto tune and manufactured artists are a nickel for a dozen its great to still hear someone that actually has talent. His voice is so soulful and enchanting I don't understand why more people in the U.S. haven't gotten in to him. This album is a treasure and I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />This album is a great throw back to great music and great singing without all the electronics behind it.<br /><br />I Love the whole album but my most favorite songs are \\"In My Dreams\\" \\"I Won't Let You Go\\" \\"Slave To The Music\\" and \\"The Awakening\\".<br /><br />Buy it you'll love it!

0132350882|5.0|There is nothing particularly new in this book. It just discusses how to write \\"clean code\\" -- the code that is really easy to understand and maintain. Nevertheless  this book is worth reading just to remind you another time how important \\"clean code\\" is!  This book provides lots of concrete advice how to make your code \\"cleaner\\". It discusses importance of proper naming, code formatting and testing. It stresses importance of constant refactoring and provides several extended refactoring examples.  But the most important advice the book gives is to always commit better code then you have checked out.  Some advices given in the book can be disputed. Some chapters are weaker (in particular chapters on concurrent programming are quite superficial). Still overall  book is definitely worth time spent reading it.
B004RBYJVO|5.0|I loved this book, it sort of reminded of In Cold Blood - or did it say that on the dust jacket? Either way it did remind me of that. You know the \\"what\\" but were waiting for the \\"why\\" - which like in Capote's novel is never answered fully. Fascinating really, but in a car wreck kind of way.
B005IS565S|4.0|If you thought 5FDP hit it with The Way of the Fist or War is the Answer, you are in for a surprise with American Capitalist. This band reminds me very much of Disturbed where all their albums have a different sound, yet it sounds just like a record by them. The title track opener is very similar to \\"Ashes\\" with the raw heaviness and melodic chorus to catch and reel you in for the rest of the album. The lines \\"War is the answer like I told you before\\" and \\"Round 3, no mercy it's the way of the fist\\" tell you that 5FDP is here to stay and they aren't going anywhere. The first single \\"Under and Over It\\" is a very catchy head banging kind of song that tells all the nay sayers to keep on doubting, because they just don't care. The Pride might have the catchiest verse I've heard from them. And yet again the chorus is one to remember. \\"Coming Down\\" and \\"Remember Everything\\" are this album's \\"Far From Home\\". Very very melodic verses and choruses that will leave you in awe. Ivan's vocals are never better than when you can feel his emotions and that is exactly what those songs do. \\"Menace\\" may be as heavy as you're going to get on this album and it will leave you banging your head and asking for more. \\"If I Fall\\" is the last standout on the album that has a chorus that will be stuck in your head for days. The album as a whole is nothing short of amazing. Yes, it is more melodic than the previous 2 albums, but with the level of musicianship this band has, it is NOT a bad thing. Songs in definite need of listening are: American Capitalist, Under and Over It, The Pride, Coming Down, Menace, Remember Everything, and If I Fall.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw the performance in the movie theatre on October 5th and 11th, and agree with the other reviewers. A thrilling spectacle! Sierra Boggess as Christine is (I think) better than Sarah Brightman; Hadley Fraser's Raoul is gripping - a powerful and beautiful voice. And I think the best looking Raoul as well! Ramin Karimloo as the phantom is excellent. All the players give very moving and heart-felt performances, not only in their singing but in their facial expressions and movements as well. The camera does take you on stage (better than a front row seat), as well as panning around the theatre before the performance and at intermission to give you the idea of 'being there'.  Seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber, Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, and the original production 'creators' on stage afterward was magical!  If you love the Phantom, you really need to see this!

B005E89X7E|5.0|Bernard Cornwell is the consummate author. This book, the sixth in the series `The Saxon Stories', is both riveting and enjoyable from start to finish. The author employs the same formula that makes all his books such a great success.   Set in the period around 900 AD, close to the end of King Alfred's reign we observe the events that helped to make and establish modern day England. King Alfred's dream was to lay the foundations of a united `Angelcynn' through military strength, the preservation of the Saxon culture and the English language. His Christian faith was also to be a major driving force in this most ambitious endeavor.    The same dream was passed onto his son Edward who was crowned king after his death. It's in this period that we see some of the most exciting events take place in the novel. The author has an incredible ability to mix historical facts with fiction in ways that both entertain and educate the reader. It's hard to put the book down.  Obviously, this tale has not finished. I'm sure that the seventh book in this series is already being planned and I look forward to its future publication.
B004Z7AHZC|3.0|I didn't ever see the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, but when my kids picked up Rodrick Rules, they insisted that I watch with them. I must admit that I found this to be more entertaining than I expected.  While it was filled with plenty of juvenile humor (which is alright...and I can enjoy it...hey, don't judge me), it also had some pretty witty writing and good acting to carry off both the verbal and physical jokes. As might be expected, the general plot was somewhat thin but still put forth an alright message to kids who were watching. While the family situation shown was somewhat dysfunctional, we have to acknowledge that every family is dysfunctional in some way. Thus, even through the slapstick and over-the-top story we can learn things about family values and loyalty and have a lot of fun laughing at the ridiculous situations.   Definitely not for everybody, but if you're willing to put up with middle-school humor and attitudes, you don't need to run away if your kids ask you to watch this with them.  3 out of 5 stars
0307272702|5.0|I ordered this book after watching Dr. Oz make a complete mockery of it on his show. I caught only about five minutes of the show and didn't even catch the name of the book. But after watching Taubes stick to his guns I looked for his books on Amazon. I bought both this one and \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\".  I finished the book in less than three days...because I couldn't put it down. Taubes offers up two hundred years of research to make a very detailed, compelling and evidence-based argument for eliminating carbs. I have never followed a diet for more than two weeks and I've been \\"trying\\" to lose the same 20 pounds for three years. At one point I was exercising five days a week for up to two hours at a time. At the end of nine months, the scale had moved five pounds. It was very frustrating, but clearly I was eating the wrong things.  Since buying the book about a month ago I've adopted the eating habits Taubes recommends and I'm down eight pounds. Understanding the science behind carbs and insulin has helped me wrap my brain around eliminating the carbs.   If you've been trying to lose weight, you should read this book. If you have a family history of diabetes, as I do, you should read this book. If you hate diet books because they don't offer enough of the \\"why\\", read this book.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau is one of those conspiracy style films I was interested in from the time I saw the first trailer. Even in the trailer, I could see potential plot holes and other problems but it looked like a lot of fun. I'm interested in going back and reading the short story by Philip Dick on which this movie was based.  The story was pretty fun with some strange chase sequences and other action elements. It posed some thoughtful questions about the nature of free will versus destiny and on the nature of personal agency. Some of the themes were a bit heavy handed but the acting was pretty solid and the concept was intriguing enough that I had fun with this movie.  3.5 out of 5 stars

I watched the \\"rated\\" version, so I'm not sure what was different.<br /><br />Anyway, this is another movie that drew me in with its intriguing premise...a pill which facilitates/compels you to use 100% of your brain rather than just the small fraction that we normally use. It's intriguing to this about what to do with that unlocked potential ability.<br /><br />I felt like Bradley Cooper's character was well developed in such a way as to give us a good juxtaposition of just how far this pill could take you. I was glad it didn't take on a \\"superhero\\" aspect a la 'Matrix' or something like that, but it was cool to see his interactions and reactions to difficult situations. I also loved that the movie drilled down on the consequences. As the adage goes: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. It was cool to see everything fall apart due to his lack of respect/planning for the power he held.<br /><br />I felt like the movie really expanded on the idea of how much each of us could truly be capable of if we would just stretch ourselves to try and use our full potential (even without a magic pill). Taken back down to us \\"normal brain users\\", there are good messages there...we should stretch ourselves, we should live up to our own potential, we should set high expectations and try to achieve them, we should set goals, we should plan, we should get off our butts and do something worthwhile. This was a fun and thoughtful movie with a subtle underlying message.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars
0061537969|5.0|A very interesting book, full of heart felt emotion, laughter, and also tears.  If you love dogs, this is the book for you because it is told by a dog.  The racing in the rain has to do with race cars, and not dogs.  A must read for inspiration and love.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|When I first heard about the premise forCowboys & Aliens, I just had to laugh. It sounded absolutely ridiculous and I had no idea how it was going to work. When I first saw the preview, it still seemed crazy, but giving a piece of alien technology to one of the cowboys seemed like a reasonable step to making this seem plausible....or at least as plausible as this scenario could be.  The movie started out very promising and reminded me of what I've loved from Westerns in the past....great, gritty character and plot development with the rebel cowboy standing up for the oppressed citizen, but only so far as he sees fit. Sadly, I felt like some of that strong plot and character development fell by the wayside once the aliens appeared. Instead we were filled with a lot of flash in the pan action sequences which were fun but not as compelling as I would've liked.   I really enjoyed both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in their roles. I especially loved the \\"slow\\" sequences with Harrison Ford as he interacted with some of his hired help or other cowboys searching for the aliens...one of my favorite scenes was when Harrison was talking with the young boy.  Overall, this movie didn't set me up to expect too much out of it...and sadly, that's all it delivered. It was fun, but not outstanding.  3 out of 5 stars
B0033TJATW|5.0|I was a little worried when I saw that the language on the back of the DVD wasn't in English, but the movie itself is indeed English and plays great :)
B003Y5H53S|2.0|When I first saw the trailer for Rango, it seemed like a whimsically funny kids movie that I'd enjoy with my kids. I was partly right.  This movie had some whimsy. It had some funny. And to an extent, my kids enjoyed it. In many senses, I felt like this movie was straddling the fence between \\"adult\\" and \\"child\\" and had a hard time planting itself adequately for either audience.  Johnny Depp's caricature gecko character of Rango is rather humorous. But a lot of his humor is drawn from Depp's personality or from jokes and allusions that would go over the heads of younger kids.  While I definitely applaud kid's movies for having \\"inside jokes\\" geared to make the adults laugh, I feel like they should be subtle enough to not bother or bore the kids. Portions of this movie included sort of existential moments where Rango is searching for the purpose of life or some definition of who he truly is. In some of these moments, the writing and plot are definitely over the head of younger kids.   We watched this with a dozen kids ranging from 2 to 12 and each of them wandered in and out of the room bored with the movie. There were some stretches where no kids were interested anymore and we had to call them back in when some cartoony action reappeared. Some of the kids were also taken back by the swearing in the film. There wasn't a ton, but there was enough that it was noticeable and off-putting for a kids cartoon.  I laughed at a number of segments in this movie and I found it generally pretty fun, but as an overall package, it didn't seem to deliver. I blame most of that on the fact that it was unable to find its true audience because it didn't know who its audience was.  2.5 out of 5 stars
B0018QCXGY|4.0|District 9 pivots on the themes of xenophobia and social segregation with an underlying element of state reliance on multinational corporations as an enforcement arm. It is stripped down and gritty, guerrilla style documentary film making applied to an essentially science fiction piece of work. Using a documentary style of film making was a nice gimmick... In the first half of the film it actually made sense.<br />We find action, imagination, and most all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction movie contained herein but... It has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama. \\"Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching\\" is how Rotten Tomatoes put it.<br />When District 9 ends, the story isn't finished. It's only the beginning. We are left wondering what will be the fate of Wikus, and what, exactly, will happen when Christopher Johnson returns. Christopher Johnson will be back, he is bringing friends and I am left wondering just what will be motivating them. This film was banned in Nigeria.<br />I for one enjoyed this movie however you must remember I thought Cloverfield was great and Sky Captain was well thought out and visually dramatic.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|My wife and I have watched various 3d movies on our TV, but The Lion King Blu-ray 3d was one of the first that really amazed us. The way that they created depth through the various animation layers was really cool, especially during the stampede scene.
B000062V9A|5.0|I live in US and I didn't know this movie was not watchable in US when I was buying it.   I watched the movie on my laptop computer and absolutely loved it. John Nash and his no-ordinary-genious's life. It is adorable. This is one of the must-watch movies.
0393019217|5.0|I loved the honesty and openness that this book was written in. It introduces the life of Richard Feynman in such an intimate way and shows the human side of his life.  He was a great man and this book just made me love him more. He was a beautiful man personally and professionally. I just love it.
6304698798|5.0|the video holds your attention from the start to the very end. The actors do a superb job. The video is fairly long so you might want to start it early in the evening.
0071762345|5.0|In the interest of transparency, I just want to disclose that I worked closely with Dave as an intern at has company, Likeable Media, over this past summer (2011). This book has everything that a business needs to get started with social media marketing. Beginner or heavy user, everyone has something to learn from Dave's book. After reading it I was able to suggest strategies to my friend's who wanted help promoting their products through Facebook and Twitter. The book is written in an easy to follow way, and includes an action plan at the end of each chapter. Whether you're the owner of a startup, an employee, or a CEO of a big firm, everyone has something to gain from this book. A must buy!
B005CM9DX6|4.0|While not quite a sequel to \\"Damnation\\" (which I loved) it leaves behind the horrid \\"Cookie Monster\\" vocals of prior albums in favor of ...singing.  Yes, Akerfeldt can actually sing, and now we finally have an Opeth album full of songs, which is the logical next step in the progression which Watershed continued.    Having said that, it took me a few listens for the album to grow on me; my initial reaction was that the album was uneven and sketchy.  Now that it's sunk its roots into me, I'll be listening to it at least as often as any other Opeth album (except for Damnation, which remains my favorite).
B003L77G10|5.0|I am totally addicted to this second season. Excellent show, excellent season. I try to slow down to savour each episode.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I have all of mayers albums and all of them are dynamic! If you are just a band-wagon music listener  someone who listens to what the media tells you to listen too) then you would not understand this artist. But if you are a true hard-core music head then this artist brings you what you've been craving for. Mayer is worth supporting check him out.
B002AF4Y9G|1.0|Natural Born Killers appears to be a movie about a Bonnie and Clyde pair of murderers set in the modern age..... and in bits and snatches, it is. Well acted by the leads in fact.   Much of the remainder, however, is a frenzied series of black and white, deliberately overacted flashbacks, disjointed surreal imagery, 50's era sitcom references and ..... why not? ..... comic book images.  If it is your intention to see an \\"art\\" flick created by a producer high on cocaine, this is you film.   If you want to see a more or less coherent film about a pair of killers in the usual Action/Horror genre...... not really.   As to the purported deeper meaning of the film mentioned by some of the fans, I might point out that one can always find meaning in the ramblings of a drunk if one tries hard enough.... that doesn't make the effort entertaining...... unless that is how you like to spend your time.
B005HSL626|2.0|So far I have no problem with this app on my phone. I played till I was capable of getting as much achievements as I possibly can other than that this game is retarded. Its pointless. Mindless game. And for those who keep complaining about ads...stop. What more do u want from a free game? U should've been well aware that you would've been getting ads from a free app. If you don't like it and u want to get the game for ur kids to play pay for it then. Stop complaining. Your reviews are pointless and aren't helpful.
1416550550|5.0|I LOVED this story. It was right up my alley. As a busy mom with not a lot of extra time or money on my hands, I have to choose my books carefully, since I can't afford to waste anything on poor reading material as my escape. I was delighted with this story, and surprised at how I couldn't put it down. I finished it quickly, and found myself stealing hours where ever I could to find out what happens next.<br /><br />I loved the characters, the writing, the setting, the story. I love books that merge different storylines and let mysteries unravel. I love stories that change character's perspectives and flip between past and present.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll also particularly love the lush English Victorian landscape portrayed in one line of the story.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I'm glad to see Firefly has made it to Amazon Instant Video. Fans of Joss Whedon, or new fans of his work, please check out Firefly. You may just become another fan of this great series.<br /><br />Can't stop the signal.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This was a wonderful online purchasing experience. I loved this movie as a kid and now my children can enjoy it too. The product was well packed and arrived several days before expected. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again.
B004Z8ZFAI|4.0|Bought this for my son for his birthday. His favorite thing was that it came with the code to download Angry Birds.
0740748475|5.0|Expensive, but worth it. My son is older now and a grad student, but it was one of the first things he came home to get when setting up house. A great coffee table book.
B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch are back with their 3rd album, American Capitalist, and they are on the top of their game. Using the same producer as the band's previous release, 5FDP has perfected the sound they've created as their own. Ivan Moody's vocal range has never sounded better, flowing effortlessly from heavy edged verses into clean choruses on most tracks, without ever sounding forced or repetitive.  There is nothing overwhelmingly new here to change peoples' minds that already dislike this band, but new and previous fans will love this offering without a doubt. The pummeling drums and heavy, catchy riffs begin with the opening track and hardly ever let up.  The drums in particular sound as good as they ever have and the guitar solos sprinkled throughout are very enjoyable as well. By now I'm sure you've heard the lead single \\"Under And Over It\\", and that song is a great indicator for what the rest of the album sounds like. The few songs that slow it down a little bit include \\"Coming Down\\", \\"Wicked Ways\\", and \\"Remember Everything\\"... the latter of which has kind of an 80's ballad feel to it, with Five Finger's special touch, and they actually pull it off pretty well. The heaviest tracks of the bunch include \\"American Capitalist\\", \\"The Pride\\", \\"Menace\\", and the fantastic album closer \\"100 Ways To Hate\\" which might be the best 5FDP song of all, with its absolutley brutal verses and haunting pre-chorus/chorus. The heaviest songs are great as always, the \\"slower\\" songs are very well written, and everything in between that hasn't been mentioned is just as good. A perfect and logical follow-up album from 'Way Of The Fist' and 'War Is The Answer' from the kings of mainstream metal.  If you haven't bought it yet, do so....then sit back and enjoy the 11 track ride!
B004ZNARH4|1.0|All I really cared about was the music.  And what do I get?  Three of four discs loose in the box with many scratches.  And two other discs in cardboard sleeves.  I wish the powers that be would have left all the crap out of the box and sprung for some real cases.  Who really needs all that cheap crap anyway, it is nothing but garbage.  They could have done so much better.  A huge disappointment!  I will be sending this pile of garbage back for a refund.  And I don't think I will be rebuying it or the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" Box.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app works very well. Great &quot;white noise&quot; app to help you fall asleep. Alot of sound options for such a small app. Definately recommend it !
B004VRK3ZU|4.0|Jumanji is quite decent effort from the director and cast. Very well made, with correctly established lines of dialogues, enough subtexts for adults to enjoy it. The Blu-Ray edition is a lot better picture wise and sound wise. Highly recommended, especially to the fans of the film.
1451629184|4.0|It is hard to fathom how this woman could have lived as prisoner for 18+ years, well into her late 20's, with her abductor. But the mind can oppress you and I am sure fear would have broken her within the first week of being this evil creeps captive.   My quibble with this book is that at the end of some chapters, she reflects upon it from her \\"now\\" perspective which tends to ruin the flow of the memoir. If you are to be there in the moment, keep us in the moment with you, but this book seems to be for her own therapy needs as much as telling her story for us.   This is a thin book. Easy to read. Not one you want to put down. I did finish it within a day. It is an extraordinary situation and I hope not one that happens to many. I'm not sure I recommend it as it's quite a confronting topic, but this is real life, and that should be told.  She is donating the profits of the sales to help other victims.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|One of his best - reminiscent of Elizabethtown Sessions or Easy Tiger.  It's great to see he's feeling better and getting back into the groove of song-writing.  I hope he starts touring again!
0062112430|4.0|Once I got into Delirium I was reading furiously, engaged with the characters and couldn't put the book down, and what a cliff hanger of an ending! Where is book two!   However the beginning is hard work. It's tedious, dull, and feels like the plan, people, and story are just being repeated over and over until you've had it shoved down your throat too many times. This is what irks me with some YA books. We have a brain, please treat us as such.   When the author was satisfied we understood the \\"Procedure\\" the book took off running and the hard slog had paid off.   I really don't like the word \\"Dystopian\\" with this book. It's more a love story than anything else and the world it's set in really isn't that hard to imagine. Countries already have boarders. People already try to flee them and their rules. It's just taking this a little further! However the rule book and the quotes from it are awesome. The way they change the bible and the government link (which I wish went to a working website) was very clever and I loved those little touches.  So overall this is a good read once you've worked through the slow beginning. It's not as cleverly written as other YA novels, and a little dumbed down, but it's still a nice book and I'm now desperate to know what happens to Lena in book two!  Worth a read.
0671027344|5.0|Read it for yourself because its too amazing to describe with words. Charlie is my new hero!! I wish the book were a lot longer!!! It makes me feel infinite! &lt;3
0123694965|5.0|This is a great purchase for anyone in the game industry. This book is very insightful and useful. It gives the reader many ways hone in on their game to create a great experience. This book was recommended to me by the lead game designer of mech assault for the xbox.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|If this app was free.... I used it in a friends phone and fell in love. Full of features. I recommend this
067144901X|5.0|My son is just over a year and brings me this book all the time.  I think it's his favorite.  He shakes his head \\"No\\" whenever I read the part about the pigs....very funny.
B004EPZ084|3.0|I saw this in the theatre and I don't Know if the sound was off but with Charlie Day's High pitched voice I ended up missing most of what he said. For the most part this movie was decent and I will rent it and try again.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This garmin watch is much more than a watch. It was requested by my daughter for her birthday. She is a marathon runner. It works as a gps and also gives you constant monitoring about your heart rate, plus other extras! Of course as always, shopping with amazon was easy!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Season 4 picks up right where season 3 left off. Which is to say, it is complicated and interesting right from the start and it just gets more interesting and addictive with each episode. My wife and I could not stop watching.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The movie was a birthday gift for my daughter. It was requested by her. It arrived quickly and undamaged. She loved the movie, and of course I loved the ease of shopping through amazon!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I just finished this book and to put it simply, I loved it.  I thought the overload of 80s geek pop culture references was, at times, a bit over the top, but it was integral to the plot and it worked.<br /><br />It is a really enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend it.  Bravo to Mr. Cline on a great first novel.
B005IS565S|5.0|The first single, \\"Under and Over It,\\" gets your blood pumping and has made many of us restless awaiting for the American Capitalist release.  Needless to say, the album has not disappointed me whatsoever. The guitar riffs are absolutely brilliant and refuse to let up throughout the album. Ivan, what can I say that you probably don't already know... He is a lyrical GENIUS and I have to say, this album show how this band can play all types of various elements, all the while staying true to who they are. Impressive as hell and that's why we all have come to know and love this band, \\"Five Finger (Ivan), DEATH PUNCH (fans),\\" now yell it with me, Five Finger, DEATH PUNCH!  This album surpasses any and all expectations 100%!
B005LBYQ6M|5.0|Ended up buying this twice.  Although it says it was just published, it's actually a reprint with the bonus material added in.  Always irritates me...
B005KAH7QU|2.0|Wow ,what a dissapointment.The first twenty minutes i was thinking,this is gonna be a great movie.Oh boy was i wrong.The rest of the movie is meaningless scenes of her traveling with a family that reminds me some weird clockwork orange film.The music reminds me of a rave party and the cinemetography makes me think of willy wonka and the choclate factory (johnny depp version).I wish i new waht i was watching but nothing really ties together and the story line never develops.watch the first twenty minutes and the last ten then return it.
0545265355|5.0|The third book is slower, but still great. I want to read these again. They r adventurous, modern, exciting, and futuristic. The best book purchase yet for me. Since these books I've read three more looking for the same feeling and have not found it. Not even with \\"the help\\" which is also a great book.
B004XQO90E|4.0|A good movie. I thought it was very imaginative. It surprised me a few times, and I liked the ending.
B005IS565S|5.0|The new 5FDP album American Capitalist is an absolutely fantastic piece of songs. I do really love it.  5FDP did over my expectations on this record, it is must buy...
B004EPZ08E|2.0|What the hell.  I buy tons of Blu-Ray movies to get the digital copy to watch on the go with my ipod.  This Ultraviolet crap using Flixster is a Horrible Idea.  I can't use the digital copy, which I paid for, unless I use their dang app which crashes.  Terrible way to \\"move-forward\\".  I just cancelled my preorder of Green-Lantern because of this digital issue and my have to start cancelling more.  This will, in the end, cost suppliers money because no one wants to stream movies on the go...that only works if you have WIFI and that isn't everywhere.  This seems like the same deal with Netflixs and we all know how that turns out.  At a time were people are watching what they spend, to start this kind of crap is again terrible.  The only thing I regret is that my grammar and spelling may not reflect my education well but just too upset at this issue to let it slide.
B00124HU42|5.0|First let me say I am a big Emmylou Harris fan, have been for years, since the 70's. I was going through my old vinyl records and copying them to my computer to digitize them. Then I plan to get rid of the old vinyl records and turntables, etc. Anyway, listening to this vinyl album with all the clicks and pops (I take very good care of my vinyl records, but some clicks and pops are inevitable), I decided this was such an excellent album that I might go ahead and spring for the CD. I connected to Amazon and found it priced at under $7 including shipping, so, what the hey.<br />Here I am listening to this with my Denon DH-D1001 headphones (which I also highly recommend with 5 stars), and WOW! it is a fantastic, fabulous piece of work. All the songs are 5 star for both technical quality and performance delivery by Emmylou.<br />I'm not audiophile reviewer and can't talk about the smoothness of this and the dynamics of that. All that I can say is that this is one heck of an album. If you are an Emmylou Harris fan and don't have this one, then you are missing out on her best album. It is an absolute must-have choice in any Emmylou Harris collection.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plenty of things to do when playing.  Definitely must have app.  Good game for everyone.  Nit surprised it was top ten apps.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Magnificent blend of spiritual jazz to chase the blues away!  Southern music is more than bluegrass and country. Let Them Talk reminds me of the music that I'd hear down the block when I was growing up in TN.  It was not for children's ears, that must be why I loved it.  Daring to be a little risque, giving a taste of forbidden fruit made it more inviting.  It is not lewd or trashy like much of todays lyrics.  It just makes you want to dance closer to your partner so you can share the music from within your body and soul. [...]
B002AT4K9Q|2.0|this is one of the best f.f. movies they made, very good story line and part five is even better, i bought this bluray from amazon bc from the pics it shows it comes in the cardboard packageing bc my other movies i try to buy with that covering, well once i open the box sadly to say this bluray didnt come with it so kinda tickd off bc it doesnt match my other blurays, owell i guess, atleast i got a good deal for it,
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game! it keeps your mind working. I'm 170 or so stars in and have gotten 3 stars on every level! I'm fortunate I got this on the free app of the day but I think it's easily worth the $0.99!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this. Since I finished it I wish it was longer (even though it wasn't short).  I even enjoyed doing all of the bonus challenges.
0316096199|5.0|I've read Alice Sebold's two works of fiction, and by far, in my opinion, her memoir, Lucky, is THE best. In fact, it is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. The writing is flawless. The \\"characters\\" memorable and human. The dialogue natural and unforced: it moves this incredible story of rape and survival toward a triumphant and satisfying ending. This is of those books where I couldn't stop turning the pages!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I was really looking forward to this book and it didn't disappoint.  As an aside, I am still having difficulty paying for an ebook that is almost as much as a hard back.  Saying that I still bought it and enjoyed it.  It was a good background story as to why he left the military.  The plot as usual was engaging and interesting.  I have read every Jack Reacher story and continue to enjoy them all. Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and I am an advid reader
B0055SWM08|5.0|beautiful graphics and music, very clever and fun to play. perfect way to pass the time on a rainy day.
0938045768|3.0|Rumor has it that John DuCane, the founder of Dragon Door, wrote this, with some help from Pavel, and that makes sense. For a marketing gimmick DuCane created a pen name and positioned the book as the work of an ex-con publishing training secrets of hard cases who've developed the physiques needed to withstand a long stretch behind bars. The tone of the book is geared toward a boy of about fourteen, which is okay, it means it's certainly an easy read though you might feel a little debased. Once you get to the exercises things improve. As other reviewers have explained, the book emphasizes a series of bodyweight exercises, none of which are new. What's valuable here is the progression. I haven't seen a progression this well-planned before. For example, push ups are taught by starting with standing push ups against a wall, which almost anyone can do, then incline push ups, then push ups from your knees, then half-way push ups, then full push ups, then one-arm push ups. This is the value of the book. There are also some good tips offered, like pausing at the bottom rather than slamming into the floor. If you want a surprisingly gentle regimen that will help you progress to increasingly harder versions of classic bodyweight exercises, this is a useful book. The best books on bodyweight exercises, in my view, are Ross Enamait's books--I wish he sold them on Amazon--and they don't have the hypertrophied prose that makes me feel like I'm in sixth grade. They're also less expensive, and they read like they were written by an adult for adults. They don't, however, have the unique zero to hero progression Convict has. Speaking of which, the whole fake convict thing leaves a bad taste; I wish Dragon Door had simply published the book as a straightforward, graduated work-your-way-to-full-fitness book, but I guess they figured that would have been far less appealing. Bottom line: it's not bad, it's not great, it's got a valuable way of making gradual progress toward the hardestversions of bodyweight classic exercises. Advice: try to get it used, at a discount, and go for it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I really like this watch. The movement sticks sometimes, but always unsticks itself just as quick. Great looking watch and a great price.

B003E74B24|5.0|After watching several of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows and being inspired to become a better cook at home I was curious to find out more about the man behind the empire. I decided to pick this 94pg. novella up before committing to one of the large books in case the ghost writer lost Gordon's famous flare.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that it was a treat and a breeze to read. \\"Humble Pie\\" is a perfect slice into the life of Gordon Ramsay.  Lots of brutal honesty for which the world both loves and hates him. It's a perfect afternoon read if you're interested in a bit of his background.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing \\"Playing with Fire\\" next. I liked this slice of pie so much I want the whole thing!

B005CGI4EG|5.0|First, let me start by saying that you CANNOT BEAT THIS PRICE.  I thought it was a mistake when I first saw it, couldn't believe it was so cheap.  The way this puppy is set up is that the DVDs come in 2 separate spindles that are inside the box. The first 6 seasons are on the left side of the box, the next 5 are on the right side.  I like the fact that it has \\"play all\\" on the dvd menu so I can fall asleep and just let it play, as opposed to those DVD series that you constantly need to hit \\"play next episode\\" or whatever, not with these.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this show and highly recommend to all fans and non-fans alike!<br />Cheers to the Bundys!!!!!
B005BGBPBG|3.0|I like the book that this movie it's made from, I read it just before the movie came out which normally it's not a good idea since books are usually better than the movies. This movie was not a disappointment, it was pretty close to the book with very minor changes which it makes it actually make more sense when you pack a book of hundreds of pages in a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because to me it is still a movie that only appeals to a female audience, the story makes the guys appear unreal with the exception of Ethan who it's played by John Krasinski (and this is because John makes him more real and funny and just enjoyable to watch him in) by the end of the movie you just wonder why the main character (Rachel) made the choices she did.<br /><br />I liked the movie, I am just happy I rent it and did not spent my money in the theater.
0446585025|5.0|I've never written a review before, but I loved this book so much that I had to let everyone know! It's a book for the whole family. I read it, my 14 year old brother liked it, my mom, and my uncle all read it and there was something for every one of us in this book. Ellen makes life lessons funny and light-hearted and I laughed so much while reading this book! Definitely worth the money
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just got into the firefly world about a year ago when a friend of mine told me this was a show that was worth my time and oh boy it is. I was pretty sad when the first season was over and there was only a movie left to watch and nothing else!<br /><br />The first episode got me completely hooked right on the spot, I was interested by the characters, the story kept me coming for more and it was entertaining, fun, packed with action, humor, funny short liners, sarcasm, love... and so much more.<br /><br />Every single main character in this show its interesting and it has something that I think everyone will feel empathy for.<br /><br />The visual effects (cg) it's good for a tv show of that time. I was thinking more on the story than on the effects which rarely happens since I work in the industry.<br /><br />I am sad that it was canceled so soon and i wish fox will give it another try or maybe another movie... I read the comic books and will be happy with more of those.<br /><br />definitely one of my fav shows!
B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch have done it again, this is now there 3rd studio album and its absolutely breathtaking! Any fan that hasn't got this album yet, you need to get it for your collection, you will be playing it day in and day out and never get bored of it! I wish i could give more stars than 5 as i personally would give it 10 out of 5 it's that good!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|so here I'm thinking, okay, I'm gonna watch another movie with Angelina in it... and it's gonna be like all the rest.. which is not so bad...but...   Johnny Depp once again makes the movie.   Yes Angelina, if your a fan defenitely adds that alouring temptress, and great adventurous actress all in one. But add Johnny to the picture and you get awesome!!!  Basically a spy movie.. where you are trying to figure out who it is they are looking for ... and are in suspense til the end, but casual suspense.  These two people are very charming together, and alas you get a humbleness from both of them in this that is truelly remarkable for the A list people they are. I'm not gonna say it again , just watch it. I will be owning it.
1466276177|4.0|Written about twenty years before the first of the Sherlock Holmes novels, this book was called by T.S. Eliot, \\"The first and greatest of English detective novels.\\"<br /><br />It's an exciting story, full of both suspense and humor. While slower paced than modern mysteries, it keeps the reader intrigued and eager to read the next chapter. Stolen jewels, mysterious bequests, and Indian jugglers are all elements of the mystery.<br /><br />The story-telling is marvelous. The plot unfolds by means of several narrators, each with his or her own style and eccentricities. The spice and humor of these various narrators keeps the story moving forward, and the switch between narrators adds to the suspense of figuring out the perpetrator of the crime. Gabriel Betteredge, one of the main narrators, is the head steward of the wealthy family involved in the mystery. His style of story-telling is fresh and delightful - and many of his rabbit trails made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Published in the 1860s, this book can occasionally come across as dated in its style and tone, but in many respects it fits better with modern sensibilities than other Victorian books. The female characters are strong and independent. The ethnically diverse characters are treated with a surprising amount of dignity and respect for the time period. The Modern Library Classics edition has helpful notes to explain the elements of the story that are confusing for modern readers.<br /><br />The characters are memorable, the plot is intriguing, and the tone is light-hearted. It's a good mystery and a fun read.
B003V5HWWA|4.0|The kids had never seen this movie and I hadn't watched it in about 10 years. We all enjoyed it a lot. Robin Williams is a master of voiceover and completely in his element. His performance is reason alone to rent this movie. The storyline is appropriate for most kids and while there are some scary parts, they aren't too intense and are not graphic. The theme of being oneself carries through the whole movie and doesn't come across in a moralistic manner.   The animation is at times grainy and flat. I remember it being quite good at the time it came out. Technology has simply advanced so far in the intervening years that older animation seems antiquated. That said, it's not too bothersome and is saved by the skill of the Disney talent pool at developing the characters personality through their actions and expressions.

143911000X|5.0|Great coffee table book. Friends pick it up everytime they sit down, just to see what it beholds. Always get a good laugh.   I actually used some of the tips in here, and received a few compliments on my dress style. I don't recommend to try most of the things in this book, but it's worth the read!  Great price too!
B005QPGHQU|2.0|If you loved the \\"old\\" Evanescence, please wait for more songs to be released on video channels before you purchase this.<br />It is a let-down in many ways.  I am very disappointed. I think many are glad that they have finally kicked-out a new album, but<br />this album does not seem to represent five years worth of work- and should have remained on the shelf.  I cannot understand<br />why SO many keep giving it five stars- to me this new album is just falling stars... Total Bust.

B0055OK2T0|5.0|I enjoyed the whole concept of the movie, the fact that one must stay true to self. It seems rare to find a movie these days that is thoughtful and human as this one was. Excellent acting and no down moments. Watch this one with unjaded eyes and enjoy.
1451629184|3.0|My feelings about Jaycee Duggard are similar to those of others here in that she is and always has been a very strong, courageous person with a wonderful spirit. I feel sure that she will have a good life ahead of her because she seeks out the good. It is something we all should learn to do.   What struck me though, and angered me, besides what was done to Jaycee by the perpetrators involved, of course, was that her mother, who supposedly loved her so much, stayed married to a man who Jaycee did not feel loved or nurtured by or safe with. It was clear that Carl favored his own daughter, and that he was on the edge of being abusive to Jaycee himself. She said during her captivity that she didn't want to go home to him, and her first question to her mother, after eighteen years, was whether Carl was still there. Where was her mother when Jaycee was still at home? Why did she allow her husband to treat Jaycee differently and badly? I thought it was so sad that Jaycee had to cling to a vision of her mother that wasn't the truth.
B004EPZ08E|2.0|***This is not a comment about the movie -- Just a recommendation for folks that are standardized on the Apple media ecosystem -- AppleTV, iPod, iPad, iPhone, and iTunes*** If you are used to buying a BluRay with Digital Copy with the intention of watching it on your AppleTV or downloading to iPad for off-line viewing (as in, on a flight), LOOK ELSEWHERE.  The digital copy here is relegated to the new half-baked UltraViolet standard.  It allows the file to be downloaded with DRM for playback by Microsoft PlayReady compatible device (good luck, outside of a PC) or streamed via the Flixster app to your iPad or iPhone.  I tested it and the video quality is terrible compared to a locally stored copy in full fidelity.  Sadly, the Flixster app's UI is just terrible. The website and login creation process is clunky and failed twice for me.  I can not recommend this.  Skip the \\"Digital Copy\\" version and go for a movie-only version.<br /><br />It should be noted that the alliance behind UV does *not* include Disney or Apple.  There is no sign that Apple will sign on to make UV alliance to make their system compatible with Apple's DRM.

B004APVI1G|5.0|i just watched the 3D Blu-Ray and was blown away by the amazing art in this film. You could see the veins on every feather as them owls were moving through the air. Visually stunning and the movie itself was pretty entertaining even as an adult. The sound was pretty good as well my woofer was rumbling in the dark dramatic scenes. This is one of my new favorites for 3D movies reminds me why i forked out the extra cash to have a 3D setup.
B0000AQS6U|1.0|I am a big fan of Cher saw her in concert twice in Vegas.  But this so called \\"The Very Best of Cher; Special 2CD Edition. Is simply nothing but bootleg crap you maybe asking yourself why is that the answer is simple the original cd \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" has 21 tracks. But this so called \\"Special 2CD Edition\\" has 39 tracks and the same exact tracks that are found on CD1 are simply repeated on CD2 with the addition of 4 extra tracks.  Buyer beware this is some bootleg crap stick to the original \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" CD.  I ordered this crap and will be returning it back to the seller for a full refund ASAP!

076115678X|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a classmate who has curly hair.  Within hours of reading it, I was ditching my shampoo and harsh hair products.  The steps are so easy to follow, and they made a huge difference for my hair.  I'm trying new styles with my hair, and even cut my own bangs with the instructions that were included. I suggested it to another curly classmate and a few days later, I knew instantly upon seeing her that her book had arrived.  Her hair looked amazing! I wish I had found this book during my \\"hide my hair in a pony tail phase\\" that lasted for 15 years! I strongly suggest buying this book or giving it as a gift! It is so well written and revolutionary!

B002UM5BXW|4.0|Anthony Bourdain is someone you either love or hate. He says what is on his mind and does what he wants to do.  Kitchen Confidential is his story of how he became the chef that he.  This may not be the story of how every chef does it, but it does seem like a lot of the kitchens I've worked in or been around.  Its a good read if you want to find out about the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen and how it all just happens.
B004LROMSO|4.0|Woven throughout this familiar tale of Camelot and King Arthur are new twists/variations that should appeal to most, even if you aren't familiar with the various versions of the story. Of course those who are familiar will recognize the central characters: Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), King Arthur (Jamie Bower), Lady Igraine (Claire Forlani), and Merlin (Joseph Fiennes). But there are some new characters: Arthur's brother Kay (Peter Mooney) and his betrayed champion, Leontes (Philip Winchester). There are the familiar themes of: sibling rivalry (one the illegitimate/reluctant ruler, and the other an ambitious vixen), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, sprinkled with tons of jealousy, betrayal and treachery; but there are new twists as well. Merlin isn't the stereotypical \\"magic-using\\" wizard, but instead comes across as a tortured/soul searching sorcerer but who is frightened of his own power , but who has grand ideas of rebuilding a nation, and creating a King. Merlin, driven to sometimes do the wrong thing for the right reasons, is perhaps the most endearing character in the entire series. Actor Joseph Fiennes brings a vulnerability to the role that I thought was unique. He could brood, pout, rant and rave, and yet you sympathize with him because he doesn't trust himself to use his power for fear that he will not be able to control himself. And while Bower doesn't exactly invoke the King Arthur image at first glance, he does bring a certain recklessness to the role that was refreshing. He's rash, impetuous, makes tons of mistakes, and does things without thinking of the consequences, but yet you still sympathize with his character because underneath it all you realize that he, although a King, is human too. He merely wants to belong and be loved, even if that means trusting unconditionally a half-sister who means him harm. Eva Green's portrayal of Morgan (Arthur's half sister) is chilling, and while she comes across as evil and dastardly, she does showus moments of vulnerability that evoke sympathy. You still dislike her, but you do understand her. And finally, one of the most subtle and endearing characters in the story (besides Merlin) is Leontes, whose faith (in God) and moral compass makes the viewer cheer for him with the hope that he will escape his fate (spoiler...which he doesn't). Leontes' betrayal shows you just how there can be tension between duty, honor and forgiveness.   Now a critique of the story, which has been done but I will put my spin on it. Young Arthur was raised by a family who did not tell him of his royal heritage, but yet he grows up spoiled and inconsiderate. He takes what he wants, when he wants.  Up until this point, Arthur has gone thru life recklessly, and yet with this new responsibility he appears to be maturing. His saving grace is his (adopted) brother who loves him unconditionally but also recognizes his weaknesses and forgives him. Anyway, when King Uther (who has battled his own demons...lust for a woman that wasn't his and loathing for a daughter who wants to be loved) dies , Merlin comes calling demanding that Arthur take his rightful place on the throne. The only problem is that Uther's exhiled daughter, Morgan Pendragon, feels hurt and betrayed and believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne, especially since she went thru all the trouble to use sorcery and magic to poison him. She has been making her own alliances, building her own army, all while assuming  that she will be Britian's new ruler. The question is what price will she pay for the magic she uses to manipulate and control those around her? She doesn't intend to let Merlin (a sorcerer who afraid to use his power) or her illegitimate half-brother Arthur to stand in her way. The viewer will enjoy the tension that exists between Merlin and his power. While initially he appears noble, at times he is misguided, and while his intentions are good, his actions don't always reflect that. He constantly struggles not to give into his urges and desires. Instead he wants to unite a kingdom, under one ruler and return Camelot to its original glory. There are some other interesting plots in the series, but you will have to watch it for yourself.   What I enjoyed most about this story was the underlying theme (while not new) that everything is not as it seems). People can be fooled (literally and figuratively) into making poor decisions, especially if it is something that they want or desire (Morgan as Lady Ingraine....Morgan as a girl...Morgan as Guinevere). I also enjoyed the explanation of how certain myths and tales were embellished to foster hope and kinship. The storyteller also took several creative liberties and changed reintroduced the various myths that we thought we knew (the lady in the lake and the sword in the stone). The only thing that I wished to see was a change in the role of Guinevere. While Egerton is incredibly beautiful, I thought that they could have done so much more with her character. She was the typical Guinevere, beguiling and yet we knew she would yield to temptation. While on the surface she appears/pretends to be noble and strong, she also comes across as fickle and confused about what she really wants. After all, she is attracted to Arthur, and yet feels an obligation to marry Leontes (who she has dated since childhood), only to later betray him.   Although there was nothing too-too original about this adaptation of the traditional story of King Arthur, there were a few new nuances that enhance the story, not to mention some  decent actors, who work well with the material they were given. There are a few slow parts, but overall there are enough fight and love scenes that kept the story moving. The DVD also offered some extras that included bloopers and interviews with the actors. At the end of the day, I don't regret those hours that I spent watching the show and the good parts (scenery, acting, etc) definitely outweighed the bad/slow parts. This version of Camelot definitely is worth watching as a marathon on a Sunday.
0439023491|3.0|Suzanne Collin's Catching Fire, the second of the Hunger Games series, starts off almost one year after the first book with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the Hunger Games' previous victors, on their victory tour through the twelve districts. Although Katniss thought nothing of her stunt of nearly committing suicide to win the games, the districts' residents and President Snow (ruler of all the districts) saw it as the start of a rebellion. As Katniss travels thorough the districts, she sees small attempts to rebel that everyone claimed she caused. The rebellions are quickly suppressed, but President Snow and others at the wealthy city of the Capitol see it as a serious threat. Directly after the tour, the seventy-fifth Hunger Games are about to be announced. Since this is a special anniversary, president Snow announces that this year's rules will call for two previous victors from each district to participate instead of new tributes. Everyone is shocked, especially Katniss, who believed herself now out of the Hunger Games' reach. She and Peeta embark to be thrown into a fight to the death against twenty-two other experienced killers.<br /> Sadly, I have to say that this book was a weak follow-up and with a far to similar plot line. Readers are once again pulled into another bloody battle for survival with lots of deja-vu feelings. It seems like you are just reading the same thing all over again. The book also did a fairly poor job of keeping me on the edge of my seat. Compared to the previous book being overloaded with such suspense, I was surprised to see it all go away. In the last book, I was continuously left on a cliff-hanger, but here I could go for days without reading the book and have no concern or thoughts of what might be happening next. While the book was overall well written and worth reading if the last book left you thinking, I wouldn't get your expectations too high.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I have never reviewed a movie here. I watched this all the way through because I thought there must be something great that would happen somewhere in this movie. I was patient and diligent. I have at least average intelligence and I found this movie to be confusing, boring and just plain sad to see what was happening in the family. My Dad was somewhat like this man and I didn't enjoy watching him treat his family so badly. I can't believe that anyone would like watching his behavior and the impact it had on his wife and children. I didn't see a lesson to be learned from it either. There was some really great cinematography but I'd rather watch a national geo movie than have to sit through this kind of nonsense. I'm sure the artsy intelligent people will continue to say what a great movie this is but they can have it.
B004IVHCOY|5.0|I haven´t rated this 5 stars lightheartedly. is this album a cornerstone in their history like Sister or Daydream Nation, a culmination of their sound as Washing Machine, a polished piece of perfection like Dirty? no. but it is pure, it is an emotional trip, it gives me goosebumps, it is unchallanged compared to other bands´ music and simply equals 5 stars judged on it´s own. it´s better than their last album (Eternal, alongside Murray Street the ONLY regular SY album that´s a litle discgrace to their standards delivered on regulars like the late NYC Ghosts and Flowers, Thousand Leaves and all others) and will never turn boring, just like the other fantastic instrumental SY soundtrack to the 1986 movie Made In Usa which accompanies me for 2 decades and still sounds fresh. yes, all these superlatives are neccessary in a review of a Sonic Youth album (except the above 2 mentioned).
B0036S4CTS|1.0|This was a book club pick and probably not one I would have read by choice. Hoping to be surprised I dug in and started reading while nursing a sick child back to health. What can I say but this was just a dreadful book! I hated the characters who never really evolved and just seemed very superficial and self-involved to the very end. The writing was tedious and boring. The story just seemed to drag on endlessly. Basically you see this snapshot of two dreary people repeated twenty times in way more detail than was ever necessary. Hopefully the movie was better but don't waste space on your Kindle or book shelf with this one.
B00001U0E1|5.0|The DVD was given as a gift for my daughter. She said it arrived on time and as of today, she has not watched this movie.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I don't particular care for war movies, but I discovered upon watching this that it wasn't a war movie at all.  You know were at war, but it doesn't focus on that aspect of it.  What it does very well is it focuses on one man's position during the war efforts.  He diffuses bombs.  This film was shot in a way that gives you a documentary feel as if its really happening.  This makes it all the more unsettling.  We follow the role of a bomb tech guy who straps on an 80lb suit in 100 degree weather in the desert.  He then goes to a location where a bomb has been discovered and he dangerously pulls the wires from it so it doesn't go off.  We watch with fearful anticipated anxiety as he carefully pulls each one out.  Onlookers by those that live in the area look on as these soldiers move into their territory in hummers with guns.  You don't know if the onlookers are good or bad and it's brilliantly captured.  This is a realistic portrait of the feeling of what it would be like if you were a soldier rolling in there or if you were living there and these guys were coming in.  Jeremy Renner plays the bomb tech guy and developed a three dimensional character with neurosis and faults.  His performance is incredible and it makes the movie all the more interesting.  The guy is cocky and has to be out of his mind to be able to perform a job such as this.  One of the better movies I've seen these days.
B000002LA2|4.0|Clapton has always defied labels while reflecting, if not defining, each era.  This album is unique in that it prominently features the glistening synthesizer sounds that were so prevalent in the mid-80's.  The influence of Phil Collins, who produced the album, is obvious on most every track.  However, even though this album is as close to 80's pop as Clapton would get, his vocals and guitar playing still shine when they need to.  The emphasis on synthesizer, if anything, shifts more emphasis to his soulful vocals, as the guitar occasionally takes a back seat.  For true Clapton fans, this is a must, as it reveals who he was at that time, as well as what rock music was doing.  Beware though: in terms of \\"guitar-hero-ness\\" (yup, just made that word up), this is not Layla, not Slowhand, not even Journeyman.  Nevertheless, it has it's own qualities that keep it in heavy rotation on my playlists.
B00555Z2PS|2.0|I love Tales it is one of my favorite records I have listened to it for years . I just got back into listening to vinyl and have a very nice set up, so I was really excited to get this, my original copy was worn and had some major pops. This new reissue is beautiful looking the colors are bright and vibrant it looks really great the vinyl thick and heavy..........BUT when I played it it just was DEAD...it sounds like a COPY of the original..... I A/B'd it against my old copy.... first off it is a lot lower in volume, but the sound is just SO flat sounding it doesn't breath or sound alive like the original. I really tried to like it, after shelling out the $$$ but no matter what it just didn't come close to the original.  You can get a Near Mint copy of the 73 pressing for half the price. I am very picky and I know the original vinyl well and I am tracking at 1.7 grams so take that into account but if you are looking for High quality audio this is not it. It was a major let down and I was looking so forward to loving it. Go to ebay and buy a NM original you won't regret it.
B0029SCFE0|5.0|Old Boy is made by a master movie maker with more than an eye for the violent and shocking. However there is no way you can turn away from the screen as this unfolds. The final ten minutes and the ending is worth waiting for. A masterpiece!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I love jazz and blues. This cd is a joy to listen to. I felt as if I were in New Orleans in the French Quarter. Hugh Laurie is a spectacular musician.
0142418471|4.0|I have been a fan of both John Green and David Levithan for a few years now, and I was excited when I heard they had collaborated on a book together. I like the way each chapter alternates between the two different Will Graysons. I also felt that the characters in this book were very well written; they felt real to me and their dialogue felt authentic. The collaboration between Green and Levithan was clearly quite successful, and I hope they collaborate again in the future. I think that if you have enjoyed any of Green or Levithan's previous works you will like this book. You will also probably enjoy this book if you are a fan of collaborative works.

B005IS565S|5.0|I just received this album today and I can tell you that it is as good or better than their previous 2 albums. They're like a good wine, they just get better with age. I will be highly surprised if the title track is not the first single off the album. There are a lot of other bands that could take some advice from 5FDP and improve upon themselves. You know how bands like Slayer win Grammy awards for metal album of the year? I think this one should be up for a Grammy this year. That's just my opinion.
B005I64U5C|3.0|The problem with this movie is that they tried to cram to much into one movie. The movie seems disjointed. First, you should stick to one villan. This movie had both Hector Hammond and Parallax in the movie. Second, why do they kill off the villans in the first movie?  In the comics the Guardians and Oa were only a small part of the story initially. Hal received \\"orders\\" through his Lamp. Nothing was mentioned of 24 hour limit of his ring and they certainly never made clear that the ring had no effect on anything yellow. Two critical limitations were not even mentioned or used in the plot. As we saw in Batman-The Dark Knight, story and plot are much more important than special effects. If there is a sequel to this movie, they need to get better writers to make it worthwhile seeing.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|I have to admit when I first heard about this series I was a bit skeptical. I thought it was riding the huge wave known as the zombie craze in 2009 when Zombieland and Left 4 Dead 2 came out. The reason why I eventually watched this series was because a friend of mine asked about HOTD's future as an anime. From watching this series I have to say its a pretty well thought out zombie scenario (if it happened in Japan anyways). The story follows a group of students, the school nurse, a young child and some random dog as they desparately survive the mysterious zombie outbreak.  From the get go the series seems like standard zombie movie plot, but it goes a little beyond that. HOTD shows the merciless slaughter of the living by the dead, the despiration of the living, and psychological derangement that could possibly happen in such an incident. The series produced by Madhouse (Death Note, Gunslinger Girl, Black Lagoon) and directed by the same guy who directed Black Lagoon. So if you enjoyed Black Lagoon, you might enjoy HOTD since they kind of have the same feel when you watch it. By far the biggest thing people complain/put off by in this series is the oversaturation of fan service. There are a lot of boob and pany shots to the point where if you hate it you'll want 24 minutes of your life back after watching one episode. Personally the fan service wasn't that bad, because I've watched other series where it completely ruined the series to the point where there was no plot anymore *points finger at Kampfer and Ikki Tousen. In the case of HOTD does it make you take the plot less seriously, at times yes, but is that plot lost because of it? No.  This set is uncut, so if you watched it on the animenetwork there are no black shades over some violent parts. If you don't believe me that its uncut then episode 6 will make it painfully obvious (watch and find out). I think the only glaring flaw is the translation of one character's name, I read the manga and it annoys the hellout of me (Arisu, when its Alice). Aside from that I throughly enjoyed the series. I would give it five stars, but it gets four because the series ends so abruptly. Though to be fair its only because the manga is still ongoing. To me I enjoyed the dark plot and because of it I bought it to show my support and perhaps bring about a second season. So if you can wade through the fan service and if you want to enjoy a good zombie series HOTD is definitely worth looking into.
B00336G7HI|1.0|Beware of these batteries! They look pretty real, but if you look closely you'll see that the print isn't very precise or clear and the battery weighs less than the real thing if you put it on a micro scale.  Most importantly, it just doesn't work. I have now tested it a dozen times, and with a full charge, it will run down in between 14 and 18 min. this is for a battery that should last over an hour minimum.  I paid 40 bucks for this battery thinking it was an original Sony! It looks like an original Sony, but unless Sony has started making 15 min. batteries and marketing them as 90 min. batteries, then this is not a Sony battery.<br /><br />My suggestion is to buy directly from a dealer which you can see and feel the real product before you buy. They will be less inclined to pass you off a fake.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Loved this game on the PC, it's actually even easier on an Android tablet (Acer Iconia A500), since I can physically tap things faster then I could move a mouse to click. The graphics quality suffers slightly, everything is a bit blurry/pixelated, you can tell the art was designed for a smaller screen. Another annoyance is any interruption, no matter how slight (eg click on android taskbar to change brightness), will force the entire game to reload, along with having to wait for the loading progress bar. You don't lose any game progress, but the delay is annoying.  It's also missing some of the mini games found in the PC version, but the main game appears exactly as I remember it.

1423113454|4.0|Sadie and Carter Kane only see each other 2 times a year- Carter normally stays with his father moving from one place to another studying Egyptology while Sadie lives in London with her grandparents. But this time when Carter and his father go to pick up Sadie, everything seems very odd and everything about this visit is going to be different than any other time: their father has unleashed the 5 great Egyptian gods, got stuck in a sarcophagus, and destroyed a ancient Egyptian artifact- not exactly how they had planned to spend their Christmas eve. And this begins an adventure that they could have never imagined filled with gods & goddesses, baboons, falcons, fruit bats, cats, crocodiles and a man with an inside out face.   The Red Pyramid, like Riordan's Lost Hero, is told from multiple points of view- switching between Carter and Sadie's narrative. I have always been a big fan of multiple narratives because you get insight that you wouldn't get with one 1st person narrator and this book is no exception (the characters even mention it, saying that they are telling this part because they know more about it). I also loved how the book is a \\"transcript of a recording\\" so throughout Sadie and Carter talk to each other and the interaction is quite funny- the two of them together are quite funny in general.   Rick Riordan is a genius at intertwining an amazing adventure with mythology, teaching the reader while taking them on an amazing ride.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one of the most vital apps I have on my phone, and I use it 6 days out of the week.  Alarm Clock Xtreme is the most feature-rich alarm clock app I've used on any phone, thus far, and I'm quite pleased with it.  I particularly enjoy being able to pick my alarm sound, and the crescendo feature.  I don't particularly enjoy being startled out of sleep, and this is a fine way so I can be more subtly awoken.  The ability to shorten the duration of the snooze, each time you hit it, is another great way to keep me from sleeping in or forgetting an important task.
0142419400|5.0|This book has a bad case of a cover and summary that does not portray the uniqueness and awesomeness of this book. To be honest, if I hadn't heard how great it was (especially from Mr. John Green himself), I probably would have not picked up this book, but I am so glad that I did. Because I LOVED IT! It was hilarious, realistic (mostly), heart wrenching- everything I wanted it to be and more!   Anna Oliphant (Banana Elephant) is being sent to Paris for her senior year of high school. This sounds like any young girl's dream, but not when she is leaving behind her life long friend and a new boy prospect. But her horribly newly rich father insists that she go and they drop her off and leave. How is she going to survive in this huge city all alone?

0062112430|3.0|Lena lives in a world where love doesn't exist. It has been classified as a disease at at the age of 18, all members of the society go through a brain altering procedure which eliminates the ability to love. However, there are resisters outside of the society, who know how important love is. Lena, though, has never fought the idea of the cure, the order and the law. She doesn't want to end up like her mother who killed herself because of incurable love. But then all begins to change as Lena is introduced into the world of the resistors.   Although Delirium can easily be compared to other dystopian books, the comparisons are fleeting. Delirium is set in a unique dystopian world which has been brilliantly crafted. The idea of eliminating love by giving brain surgery is fascinating and the \\"blah\\"ness of the characters with the cure really hit home. To only care about order and law must really be a horrible way to live (but I can only see that because I do have the capacity to care).   I gave this books 3 stars instead of 4 (which I did consider) because of a couple reasons:   -I really felt that the beginning was quite slow. It was too easy to put down and took too long to get into. The last 200 pages, however, were fantastic.   -I want to know more! What did the scientists find? What were the bombings in the wild supposed to accomplish? How did they persuade the nation? How did they change history? I want to know more!
B005CM9DX6|2.0|I have never been a fan of Opeths albums that used the death VOX vocals.  Do like Damnation and much of Watershed where the singers natural voice is used.  This new CD is a complete departure from anything Opeth has released in the past.  So, if you are thinking about buying it because you like their past releases, suggest you preview the songs first.  Wish I had done that and saved myself from this purchase.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|I'm such a huge Joe Bonamassa fan that, if I was sitting where you are now, I'd already be out the door, looking for his album, \\"Dust Bowl\\".  In fact, that's exactly what I did. And, you know what? No matter where I looked, I couldn't find the darn thing!<br /><br />After several months, I broke down and ordered it online which is what I should have done from the git-go.  Silly me.<br /><br />I feel especially silly after I received it and have listened to it `bout a bijillion times because it's that good! And to think that I missed out on six months of intense musical pleasure.<br /><br />I've learned my lesson and have order his brand spanking new CD, Don't Explain, recorded with Beth Hart.  Stay tuned for that more timely review.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Better late than never, I've enjoyed listening to Dust Bowl and have it firmly burned into my DNA.  The album is chock-full of incredible musical wizardry - not only by Joe but a boat load of incredible artist like Carmine Rojas and Rick Melick, guest musicians Anton Fig, John Haitt, Vince Gill, Michael Rhodes (reknown Nashville session bassist), Chad Cromwell (drumming credits include Peter Frampton, Neil Young and Mark Knopfler), Steve Nathan (acclaimed Nashville based session keyboardist), Tony Cedras, Glenn Hughes, Arlan Schierbaum, Blondie Chaplin, Beth Hart,  and Reese Wynans. Heck, he even brought in the guy who makes his amps, Peter Van Weelden, to lend his voice to the title cut.<br /><br />Dust Bowl starts out with low down and dirty, Slow Train, that Joe co-wrote with the album's producer, Kevin Shirley. The smokin' hot solos and a groove as deep as a cotton field row has made this tune a crowd favorite. While every tune on this album has earned multiple hits on the repeat button, Slow Train has probably edged out the rest as getting the most such hits.<br /><br />The title cut is chock full of riffs and beats that destine this tune for use in movies, advertisements and bumper music. In its own funky way, it kind of reminds me of the Stones' Anyone Seen My Baby.  Following Dust Bowl is Tennessee Plates features the unmistakable vocals of John Haitt and signature guitar work by Vince Gill.  It wouldn't surprise me a bit if this cut is getting significant rotation on country stations around the country.  If it isn't, it should.  Heck, it deserves a funky video for play on GAC and CMT, it's that good!<br /><br />The Meaning of the Blues again offers up some incredible solos by Joe that easily allows the listener to envision Bonamassa kickin' it out on stage and leaving the audience pleasantly exhausted when it's all said and done.  Homage is paid to the coal miners of the world with Black Lung Heartache and is played against a dark and heavy musical backdrop befitting of them song's message.<br /><br />The Last Matador of Bayonne emits a whole range of emotions from both player and listener alike and is, by far, one of the Boomerocity's 12 favorites from this album (you didn't expect me to actually pick a favorite, did you?).  No Love On The Street is a Michael Kamen/Tim Curry tune that features rhythm guitar work by Blondie Chapman. The vocal assistance by Beth Hart was, no doubt, a precursor to Joe's new collaborative release, Don't Explain, with Ms. Hart.  If this tune is any indication of what that album contains then I can't wait to hear it!<br /><br /> If you're like me and are late to the Dust Bowl party, then I suggest you get off your musical butt and buy the darn thing because it's going to give Bonamassa (as well as blues) fans countless hours of listening enjoyment.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comBaby.

B003Y5H57E|5.0|Was not really looking forward to this movie, but was dragged to the theater by my fiance.

1558908846|5.0|This is one of the BEST comic to film adaptations ever made.  Mind you, if you're not familiar with the comics and graphic novles, you can't possibly appreciate what a fine film this is.  For those not in the know, Sly, in three different character incarnations of himself has actually appeared in the comics.  As for the whole, \\"Dredd never took off his helmet\\" thing, that is not entirely true.  In one, single panel, I forget which issue, Dredd has gone undercover as a member of the Wally Squad and it's not his face, but he is not wearing the helmet.  But I digress.<br /><br />From the block war to the Hall of justice to the greatest handgun ever designed, The Lawgiver...this IS the penultimate Judge Dredd movie to date.  Yes a new one is being made and as it is being made as a British production and Dredd is a British creation, I am excited to see what is in store.<br /><br />A future releae, in Blu-Rey with the deleted scence would be a trasure to own.  Sadly, it was made so long ago we will never see the I think it was twenty or so minutes of footage stallone had removed to assure the movie received a PG-13 rating.  Instead, the critics, without having seen the film appararently, gave it an \\"R\\" rating which was not what it was.<br /><br />I would love to see Sly Stallone in a cameo appearance.  In a scene whenin he, as an unidentified, UNHELMETED, Judge is walking out the doors into to Cursed Earth on his own Long Walk.  THAT would be cool.
B005ELQVGW|4.0|First thing I noticed: This is the deluxe edition, which includes three bonus tracks (Hollow: Original 7-Minutes Version, Dark Matter with Choir+Organ, and Náttúra). Though I only ordered the regular version, I don't really care.  The first time I put it into my CD drive, nothing happened, but it recognized the disc after I wiped it off.  Moon: This sounds like an Indian tribe being attacked by a grizzly bear while tuning their guitars. Note: if you like bass, you will be pulling your hair out waiting for the bassline to take off, but it never does. Kinda odd, really. It was slightly irritating at first, but I got used to it. \\"Adrenaline\\" is misspelled in the booklet. Gets slapped in the face with an \\"interesting\\" stamp. And not the good kind of \\"interesting,\\" either. Kinda like catfish. (Inside joke, sorry.)  Thunderbolt: Firstly, I never thought that any signed artist would ever pull off a Tesla coil. A couple years ago, I realized that Björk was an exception to that rule, and she has fulfilled her duty. Otherwise, this song starts out organ-y and (thank God) turns bass-y, unlike Moon, which just sits there basswise. In addition, the booklet seems to replace \\"those\\" with \\"these,\\" but I also thought that \\"gods\\" in Moon was \\"goats,\\" so don't look at me. The bridge is interesting, but in a good way. The Tesla coil at the end is freaking awesome, which definitely pushed this over the top with an \\"awesometudinous\\" label!  Crystalline: The beginning of the bassline scares me every time, as my surround-sound system makes it sound like little explosions behind me. This time, there is definitely an error in the booklet, which is small, but still there (\\"the\\" -> \\"our\\"). It's little things like this that make me cringe inside (why no proofreaders??). Again with the great bassline (\\"Moon\\" seems to have been but an outlier). More instruments this time, which is nice, and ocean-like sound effects. This just gets a plain \\"awesome,\\" however, rather than an \\"awesometudinous,\\" due to a distinct lack of Tesla coils.  Cosmogony: Ooh. Choirish. After the choirishness at the beginning, it breaks into bassiness, which looks strange in writing, but Björk (who pretty much does everything, as I've noticed in the booklet credits) pulled it off. This pretty much constitutes a new view on creationism. I'm non-religious, and can appreciate the story told here. I don't know if that should say \\"and\\" or \\"but,\\" as I don't know any Christians or Jews that I can try this on to see if they like it. The last minute of this is bizarre and similar to that whole foghorn thing going on between Earth Intruders and Wanderlust on Volta, but I'm still labeling it \\"pseudocreationistic.\\"  Dark Matter: The booklet includes no lyrics. The lyrics are \\"halowl simtu halsimantu-woooooo lukunu omithal puthim meduci haltsimin doooo haltsimin andaeltsiminaltoo andecalmianedu hooooooooo woo altar wogalivar and dantu etharsaltsoul etiarpu nay anweetharandu ialonanthanow duwao hoatsimomay duhukuluhu heum.\\" This is very... scary. Suitable for the theme. \\"Andaeltsiminaltoo.\\"  Hollow: This sounds to me like a bizarre reinterpretation of Earth Intruders. With drums. And flutes. And awesome alienness. It gets labeled \\"marching with twigs and branches.\\"  Virus: I definitely see the snails in there. This is creepily, zombieishly, bassishly, excellent. Certianly \\"like a flame that seeks explosives.\\"  Sacrifice: A mix of Dark Matter, Hollow, and Virus. In the middle, it gets all bassy and distorted, which was definitely intentional. Either that or the world's best mistake. I am labeling it \\"the explosive for the flame.\\"  Mutual Core: I don't know what to think of this. I honestly don't. I'm all reviewed out.  Solstice: This sounds like an \\"afterthought.\\" You may ignore it if you wish.  Hollow (Original 7-Minute Version): Even the beats at the very beginning sound better than in normal Hollow. I definitely prefer this over Hollow, as it is \\"longer\\" and you can never have too much Hollow, now, can you?  Dark Matter (With Choir and Organ): \\"Scarier.\\" Why would anyone not get the Deluxe version, except because of cost? Even I got it, and I didn't mean to!  Náttúra: I never actually heard this before, but it fits better on Biophilia than I expected - certainly better than \\"Solstice.\\" The oldish Icelandic environmental-awareness track was clearly not designed for an album release, but it certainly fits, if even so a bit jaggedly. It is just that - \\"a jagged fit, but still a fit.\\"  I had been wondering since I first heard about it whether Biophilia would be another Medúlla (awful), Homogenic (awesome), or Volta (aardvarkish). Somehow, Björk managed to pull off all three - the awesomeness of Homogenic, the peculiarness (not awfulness) of Medúlla, AND the interestingness of Volta. The only tracks I would avoid are Moon and Solstice, and, if it were up to me, I would put the Original 7-Minute Version of Hollow in the latter's place. (Dark Matter is best left untouched.)  In short: BUY. BUY BUY BUY. BUY. Admittedly, this is just another to add to my not-so-picky list of non-suckish Björk albums (Debut, Post, Homogenic, Selmasongs, Vespertine, and Volta)... but that's certainly an improvement over the Björk, Gling-Gló, Drawing Restraint 9, and Medúlla list.  Overview of tracks:  Moon: Interesting (*)  Thunderbolt: Awesometudinous (*****)  Crystalline: Awesome (****)  Cosmogony: Pseudocreationistic (****)  Dark Matter: Andaeltsiminaltoo (***)  Hollow: Marching with twigs and branches (***)  Virus: Like a flame that seeks explosives (*****)  Sacrifice: The explosive for the flame (****)  Mutual Core: ???

B005GVW05Q|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />At first listen Ryan Adams seems to have turned in a mostly safe, predictable record wrapped in familiar, country-flavored, pop-rock, singer-songwriter sounds and sentiments.  Most of the songs at first seem to sound and feel less edgy and less interesting than much of his more familiar and well-loved work (eight out of eleven tracks are slow to mid tempo numbers).<br /><br />But as is often the case with Ryan Adams, repeated listening reveals the true quality of his less instantly accessible music.  The slower songs here are growers that like to sneak up and tap me on the shoulder when I'm in the right mood.<br /><br />When Adams picks up the pace on tracks like \\"Ashes & Fire,\\" \\"Chains of Love,\\" and \\"Lucky Now\\" I feel my pulse quicken and I find myself thinking \\"here we go now, that`s the stuff, give daddy some more of that sweet, sweet music...\\"<br /><br />This is an album that resembles Dylan's early 70's work a bit, confirming again what marriage, domestic security, and a retreat from the spotlight (whether literal or figurative) can do to a brilliant young singer-songwriter who is both revered and reviled in the public eye.  The title track \\"Ashes & Fire\\" is the most Dylanesque of the songs in this collection.<br /><br />This is a worthy purchase for Ryan Adams fans.  Newcomers may want to pick up one of his earlier solo records or maybe his last outing with The Cardinals before giving this one a try.<br /><br />Speaking of The Cardinals - here's an idea for your next record Ryan - a true collaboration with Cardinals lead guitarist Neal Casal that includes shared songwriting credits and shared lead vocals.  Deep down I think you know that Adams/Casal could be the alt-country Lennon/McCartney, but are you secure enough to share the spotlight with Neal?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener

B005GVA2L0|1.0|Fallen was a masterpiece!  It  stayed on the charts forever and sold 7 million copies in the US alone.  Every song was wonderfully crafted, catchy, and terrific!  Musical perfection it was with that goth/metal/sweet voice!  The Open Door the second CD paled in comparison and sold a couple million copies mainly because of the success and anticipation after the first CD!  Now 5 years later comes even a worse effort than The Open Door. I'm sorry Amy Lee can't hardly write good songs musical at all anymore.  They all rely on basic hooks repeated throughout the song, they are generic sounding tunes that sound like Evanescence, but not great Evanescence!  After I heard most of them 5-6 times, I dont want to hear them again!  Is this the best she could come up with after 5 years?  I'm sorry there is NO WAY this is going to be a hit.  Maybe Gold?  It would be surprising if Evanescence (2011) even goes Platinum. I seriously doubt it!  All the die hard fans raving about this CD, how many of you are there actually?  I bet there wont be 100 of you to come here and rave about this CD!  There was 2,000 that came here and raved Fallen including myself.  That's what makes a hit album, a GREAT CD, great songs, great production, songs that long to be played on the radio (one after the other), great word of mouth, and next thing you know millions have bought the CD!  Not 50 people who would say anything they come out with is a 5 star masterpiece.  Your WAYYYYYYY to easy to please!  Now that said, there are a few good songs on this CD!  I do like \\"Sick\\", \\"Never Going Back\\", \\"End Of The Dream\\", \\"Swimming Home\\", Disappear, and \\"Secret Door\\" is an AWESOME song.  WHY IS THERE NOT MORE SONGS LIKE THAT??????????  The last two songs I listed are from the bonus CD.  But we're talking 4 out of 12 or 6 out of 16 (on the Deluxe version).  10 songs on this album arent even worthy of release.  Somehow I doubt Amy has really been working on this CD for 5 years, considering all the strife and firingmost of the band members, this is part of her problem.  She thinks she alone is Evanescence!  Evanescence was a band where more than one person had an input and contributed to the songwriting and production.  This is Amy Lee trying her best to recapture what they made during Fallen. It doesnt even come close!  And give me all the thumbs down you want, let the success of the album tell the real story!  I believe it wont even last 4 weeks in the top 10!  And it will never come back into the top 10 again!  And 4 or 5 years from now, Amy will be trying again but the interest is going to keep fading as time and MORE bad albums are released.  I will not take her seriously again, she has to prove me wrong next time!  UPDATE 11/12/2011  Well it fell off after 4 weeks alright, down to #28 (from #13 in week 3).  This album is not even going to go Gold.  It's a terrible album like I said all the people that love this CD there aren't that many of you (only 170,000 people even bought this CD in the entire US).  Definitely for die hard fans only!  Coldplay is suffering the same fate after 1 good sales week, Mylo Xyloto is taking a huge dive.  It's the same reason as Evanescence, their new CD stinks!  Two huge disappointments from two bands I really like.  In Evanescence case (like Coldplay), it's not because they arent popular.  Evanescence is still VERY popular! People want to hear great new material, and pass the word, hear singles on the radio, and acquire BRAND new fans who are getting into the new music.  But an album like Evanescence 2011 is NEVER going to produce any hits, or turn anyone new on to this band.  Amy Lee needs to collaborate with someone new and come up with some killer tunes, better production, better songs musically, and make something catchy.  Not just generic songs that resemble old Evanescence songs, but unique, great compositions that will put them back on top.  I'll be waiting and hoping for that day to come in a few years or so.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Well I saw this movie in the Theaters at midnight. It was the best film of them all. The score was genius and the plot of the movie followed very close to the book. The new added scenes were expected and great to be honest. I honestly cannot wait for an Ultimate edition where I can watch delted scenes.<br /><br />This movie follows The Trios journey t destroy the the last Horcruxes. The teachers were so awesome in this film, first e get to see old characters and then McGonnagal... KICKASS!!<br /><br />This is one of the movies you must have in your collection as well as Part 1. But if you havent read the books, I suggest to look at them during your summer.

0439023521|5.0|I very much enjoyed the hunger games. The first one was so good however I didn't feel the same about the series as I did about the first book. It was a really really good book, but the third was a bit strange to me....
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I've known every song on this recording intimately for many years.  This album re-imagines them and gives us an entirely new take on both Peter's lyrics, and the musical language in his songs.  I almost didn't recognize the orchestral intro to \\"In Your Eyes\\", but the slow beginning and the building volume and temple give it a new life that I never suspected was there.  Each track brings its own chills and emotion.  One of the best tracks is \\"Wallflower\\", always a beautiful number, but with the tasteful orchestration and new pacing, it takes us in a powerfully new direction.<br />Another pleasant surprise in this collection is how wonderful the instrumental disk sounds. There is an element of mystery that moves in and lends disk two a very different flavor.<br />If you are a PG fan, you will love this album.  And take my word for it - if you've been listening to the teasers and the pre-release recordings that have been out, you are in for a surprise.  As good as some of them were, none comes close to just how poignant and intense this album is.  Bravo, Peter![[ASIN:B005HXGE9G New Blood (Special Edition  2CD)]]
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I just got back from watching this exact performance at my local theatre, and I must admit, I am most impressed.<br /><br />I was frightened that this might not be a staging at all, but more along the lines of a \\"concert in costume\\" much like the dissapointment I felt when I saw the Les Miserable's concert on Public TV.<br /><br />Fear not.  This production is pretty dead on to the staging that appears in the shows that I have watched live, and considering this was filmed \\"live\\" and simulcast, it is truly a sight to behold.<br /><br />While this performance can't even compare to \\"being there\\" it is far removed than the sterile affair put on the screen by Joel Schumaker.  Don't get me wrong.  There is plenty of things I like about the movie, (like the spine tingling opening sequence, or the red hot sexuality of Point of No Return).  But this by far is the most accurate \\"filming\\" I have seen of any ALW production.<br /><br />Unlike Joseph, JC Superstar and CATS, which were \\"staged\\" recordings specifically for video, with all the \\"cuts\\" that go with it, This is a live filming that was simulcast live around the world on Oct 2, 2011 and ran on limited encore performances in movie theatres for the next few days.  There are no \\"best performances\\" or \\"second chances\\".  We get what was actually presented to the audience on Oct 2, and that alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Due to the height of the roof of the Royal Albert Hall and either logistics or safety concerns revolving around hurling a Chandalier from such a dizzying height, suffice it to say, the chandalier does not crash to the stage at the end of Act 1, nor does it \\"float\\" from the stage in it's glory during the overture.  Instead, the tarp is removed during the overture, and fireworks accompany the chandeliers destruction at the end of Act 1.  This is sure to be a bit of a disappointment to most Phantom fans, and if you need to experience a crashing chandalier, you will have to go to one of the live performances currently touring around the world.  On the plus side there are quite a few shots of the show taken \\"throguh\\" the chandelier onto the stage below, which gives you the feeling that you are the phantom, spying at the action below from top of the chandelier.  It's not as dramatic, but they did what they could and it's hard to fault them for something that was probably completely out of their control.<br /><br />The production also makes extensive use of LED screens as backdrops much like was done in Love Never Dies.  This can is be both effective and a bit disconcerting.  One example is the backdrop of Andre and Fermin's office, which is setup to look like a wall with opera posters posted on it.  From a distance, these work fine.  However, some of the cameras are really close to the stage and causes this effect to pixelate greatly which takes away some of the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The use of LED screens is also used to mimic Christines Mirror during her Angel of Music number in which Christine approaches the mirror with the Phantoms face singing in the upper right corner of the mirror.  Towards the end, the screen simply slides away to review the Phantom walking towards her with the fog rolling at his feet.<br /><br />Another different use of the screens is during \\"Notes\\" when the phantom is reading how Christine is to star in 'Il Muto, we see handwriting appearing as well as the phantom singing his instructions on how Christine is to be granted the role of the dutchess while Carlotta plays the pageboy.  One cool effect that the LED screens provided was during the end of Think of Me, Christine faces the rear of the stage, and the actual applause from the live audience is projected on the rear screens giving the audience the feeling that they are behind Christine and their own reaction is the reaction of the \\"audience\\" who just watched her aria from Hannibal.  It's hard to describe but a cool efect.<br /><br />It's also fair to note that these \\"screens\\" were necessary given the sheer size of the arena, and in the vastness of the RAH, some consideration had to be made to those in the nosebleed seats, so we see some scenes where the Phantom is projected on the real wall so that the paying customer in the back can better see the action.<br /><br />It's just that they lose much of their effectiveness when filmed.<br /><br />Speaking of filming, the camera work is stunning.  Thanks to HD and the extreme closeup we fully see the emotional range the Phantom shows at his love/hate relationship with Christine.  Some might say we see too much as I was distracted by wrinkles in the Phantoms facial prostesis where it was peeling from his neckline.  Proof positive that this was shot live.<br /><br />The performances from the cast were spot on, and it's amazing how I find different parts of the musical which resonate with me depending on the production.<br /><br />In the live stage productions I have seen, the \\"Phantom of The Opera/Music of the Night\\" sequence always sent shivers down my spine.  The motion picture's rendition of \\"Past the Point of No Return\\" has a sexual tension and animal magnetism not experienced on any stage performance I have seen.  The stand out number for me in this version clearly was \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.\\"  This has never been a favorite number of mine until now.  Sierra Boggess really sells that performance and my mouth was on the floor when it was over.<br /><br />The Phantom in this production is also more believable.  Ramin Karimloo brings out an anquished performance of a \\"monster\\" with the heart of an \\"artist\\".  His makeup is not over the top but grotesque enough to give someone pause.  My biggest beef about the motion picture is that no woman in her right mind would have rejected Gerard Butler's Phantom.  Even with his \\"hideous\\" makeup he was way too pretty.  A slight rash, a droopy eye and a swollen lip?  Really?  I've seen uglier people at Wal-Mart.  But Karimloo's Phantom is sufficiently hideous.  You sense the bravery it took Christine to kiss him in the final scene and that courage is not lost on the Phantom, which leads to his change of heart.<br /><br />One suprising highlight was the role of Carlotta.  In all the past performances, Carlotta was portrayed in Caricature.  Nowehre is this more apparant than in Minnie Drivers over the top performance in the film.  Here, Carlotta is almost a sympathetic character.  She clearly fears not only the Phantom, but also the rise of this \\"precious little Ingenue\\".  She clearly see's Christine as a threat to her dominance at the Opera and we see a true human side to her as portrayed by her fear when the piano starts playing by itself during the rehersal for Don Juan Triumphant.  In the past Carlotta had always been a throwaway part, but in this performance it is done with an authenticity that I have never before seen.<br /><br />Overall, the show is brilliant and I am ecstatic that it will be coming to DVD/Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately Phantom is no longer touring in North America, so my chances to see it live require a trip to New York, or Las Vegas to see the \\"truncated\\" version.  And if my children never have the opportunity to see it live, at least they can appreciate this version.  While it is nowhere close to experiencing Phantom for yourself, it is definitely more authentic than the movie, and slight staging differences aside, is as accurate a staging of the original show as could be done in the venue that it was pressented.<br /><br />One final bonus is the appearance on stage of the surviving Orignal London Cast including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  Unfortunately Michael does no singing, but we do get two numbers with Sarah and four previous phantoms.  The Phantoms are outstanding, but clearly Sarah's voice lacks the punch it had 25 years ago.  This is not a criticism but just a fact of growing older.  It was still nice to see the original production team on stage.<br /><br />While it seems I have levied quite a few criticisms in this review, it is simply there to let you know what you are getting before you buy.  The performance was outstanding and much more accurate to the original show than the movie.  If you are a fan of the original show, you will find plenty to like here.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will see different nuances than was presented by the film.<br /><br />Anyway, however you look at it.  At it's core, it is still Phantom, and a mighty fine one at that.  A must buy for anyone who loves this show, and anyone who has yet to see it performed on stage.antom is sufficiently hideous.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Remembers words and phrases I type in, even the bad ones. Used to use Swype and really liked it, but I love this. Much more accurate.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I was recently stuck on a 14 hour flight and the selection of movies was not that great.  Usually, I avoid action movies like the plague, but I decided to give this one a try.  This movie is fantastic from start to finish, and seems to rise above its subject matter and origins.  The cast are great, and they all look like they are having tremendous fun. Plus, not one of the parts has been underwritten - all of them have something good to say or something fun to do.  My favourite was the Rock. He was wonderfully over the top in this movie, and he looks like he eats and drinks testosterone at every meal.  This movie is great fun and will not leave you disappointed.
0316017930|5.0|What separates the truly visionary and successful from those that seemingly have the same opportunities? It's not what you might think. Cultural legacy plays a significant part in how we thrive through this world. It defines us from the moment we begin to learn and dictates how we approach what life throws at us. Understanding cultural legacy not only helps us shed some of our own obstacles to success but also enables us to learn, on a much more fundamental level, the success of others.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Being a big fan of all work Steven Wilson has been involved with & also his previous solo work, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect on this record. That to me is something a great artists always contains, that sense of catching the listener off guard from start to finish of a new record or project. When I finally received this album, from the first second to the last, I was completely captivated and focused on everything I was hearing. There is so much in your face, and so very much under the surface that you can not catch it all in one listen. To me, this record is in a different league compared to Insurgentes. Not that is is steps above, but just that it is a different taste. There are moments of great vulnerability lyric wise & vocal wise, very frail and straight-forward. Whether or not you are a fan of his work or someone who hasn't heard anything from him before, I highly, highly suggest buying this album. I won't get too much more in depth, I will leave the rest up to you. Steven Wilson is one of the 'true' artists we have left. He doesn't just think about the music, he thinks about the presentation. He thinks how you will feel every second of every song, and also when you hold the vinyl records or cd, and he really captivates who ever is involved with what he has released. Best record of 2011, best record I have heard in a long time.
B000T0XED6|2.0|I collect as many versions of The Beethoven Sonatas as I can get my hands on - but I regret spending my money on this exhibit.<br /><br />Signor Pollini gives me the impression of a pianist who is BRILLIANT at sight-reading some very tricky piano music. These performances sound like he stepped into a studio - propped the sheet-music up, and proceeded to play through it after years of not having looked at it! Yes, as his fans say, he does give you an overall picture of the structure of the work, but that's because he breezes past most detail, creating a sort of mold of a masterpiece rather than an artist's interpretation or image of a work, worth something in its own right due to personal details/colours.<br /><br />These performances would be interesting to listen to a few times, but they are marred by some horrible engineering decisions. People moan about DGs Digital 80s recordings - but Pollini and his stablemates have been better served in those 80s recordings than the disaster (sonically) one finds here: they have managed to make the piano sound cavernous - blighted with reverb, in an effort to make it sound like it's a public recital - a recording process for piano which I really don't like. (Give me that nice, airless, flat sound of Glenn Gould studio recordings - my idea of piano recording perfection.) Usually, a small consolation for having the microphone at a distance from the piano is that we don't have to hear extraneous noises from the artist. Well here, the terrible engineers/mixers have somehow made the piano sound distant while also managing to capture every sigh, grunt and groan from Pollini! Some people debate whether he's an aloof or objective or 'cool' pianist - I think he's literally COOL - on the 4th movement of Op 2/1 he sounds like he's drinking a slurpee/slushee WHILE sight-reading the piece! No mean feat at prestissimo! On Op 2/2 - the mix or recording improves a tad, the heavy breathing a little less intrusive, the slurping almost non-existent. I dare not listen to this on headphones lest I feel like Darth Vader has popped in to have a listen to some Beethoven - that's how intrusive the breathing is.<br />I purchased the download of this, so I don't know if different engineers/mixers were used for the different pieces, but whoever recorded/mixed Op2/1 should hang his head in shame. Time for me to go back to my current flame, the Schiff Beethoven cycle for a while.

B0052GACNM|2.0|I have the first Duets CD, and I have the PBS fund-raising Duets special on my DVR.  They both were nothing short of excellent, among the best of the best.  This CD, on the other hand, seems like a theme gone stale.  There are some good vocals, of course, Mr. Bennett, but also k.d. lang, Michael Buble, Norah Jones, and Natalie Cole populate my short list.  There are also too many screechers on the disc who have trouble hitting the high notes, Lady Gaga, Sheryl Crow, Queen Latifah what ever possessed you to try to keep up with Mr. Bennett.  You are so far out of your class, it hurt to listen.  And then there's Aretha.  It pained me to press \\"skip\\" halfway through her song, but I had to, as it was more painful to listen to it.  If I had known then what I know now, I would not have bought this disc.

B005IS565S|5.0|Thank god there's new Five Finger Death Punch out, I've waited 2 years for this day. Album is perfect, from Zoltan's riffs to Ivan's devilish, yet angelic, voice, it is what every knuckhead would have wanted from a new album and more.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|It can't be easy to be Peter Gabriel.  You put out two discs back to back both with lush, brilliantly arranged orchestral songs (one of covers and the other originals) and what you get is a bunch of flack from ungratefuls who want to see another SO.  Ugh.  Seriously.  What else do you want?  In this he basically gave us a greatest hits re imagined and infused with passion to spare.  New emotions from old songs swoon and emerge again in vibrant vivid color.  And his voice is AMAZING still - identical from work he recorded in the late seventies/early eighties.  How does he do it?  He stays true to his muse.  He never compromises.  He'll release another studio album when he's good and ready and when he does it will no doubt be a deliberate, thoughtful, and sincerely powerful work - just look at his track record.  OK. I admit, maybe he should stop having his daughter sing on his stuff - seriously her voice even on these limited tracks couldn't carry a paperclip.  But his misplaced family loyalty aside, PG is a genius, respected in not just the music industry, but Hollywood, and by musicians across the world.  No mission of his can be fruitless.  He grows, learns and conjours ghosts others only dream of.  And in NEW BLOOD he's given us a brilliant disc - from the theatrical Intruder to the heartbreaking Wallflower or the classic In Your Eyes.  I saw him do these songs live at the Hollywood Bowl and they were every bit as magical.  I will not forget that show til the say I die.  For those who don't appreciate this or Scratch My Back, I believe the future will prove you wrong.  Because if anyone knows how to make powerful recordings that stand the test of time, it's Peter.
1419702203|4.0|This is a wonderful book, full of magnificent photos and insights into George that only his wife could have.    Recommended, but a caveat.  Let's see, his first wife, Patty wrote a book about George, Eric Clapton, etc.  Cynthia Lennon wrote a tell-all book about John.  Pete Best wrote a book.  Peter Brown wrote a book.  Several of their record producers and assorted hangers-on, roadies and loose associates have written books.  I love the Beatles and have read many of the books written about them collectively and individually, but seriously, is there really much more that needs to be written or said about them?  We refer to them all by their first names, they're so familiar to us.  It's now been 40 plus years since the Beatles were kings.  Me thinks that anyone who had any association w/ them whatever is standing in line looking for their pay-off.  Is nothing sacred and private anymore?  I can't imagine writing a book in which I share intimate details of my relationship w/ my wife.  Maybe that's just me.
1416594787|4.0|Hello,  I've been hearing a lot of intelligent people speaking of evolution as an undisputed fact so I wanted to check out the evidence. The preface for TGSOE told me I came to the right place since this book was expressly written to provide the evidence for evolution.    At least one reviewer (an evolutionist) believed the book was well done but he was already sold on evolution. He wondered its impact on someone not sold on evolution. Consider me one who was not sold on evolution but as one seeking answers.    Mister Dawkins did a credible job telling of various experiments that \\"proved\\" evolution. To me they seemed to prove a refining of systems that were already in place but no evidence of how a new complex system could come to be -that is my stumbling block with evolution. Also our inability to make anything \\"living\\" from basic non-living elements was freely admitted (but he was confident we will accomplish this in the next few decades). It would seem to me that that key piece of evidence should be in place before evolution could be nominated for \\"fact\\" status.  I gave the book four stars not because it sold me on evolution, but it did a good job of informing me of the current state of its knowledge.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Christian. Having become a Christian late in life, I am always evaluating what I believe with an open mind. I have a deep respect for science and strive to keep my beliefs in line with reality.  Strange as it will sound -this book actually strengthened my belief in a Creator.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|We are looking for the films we saw from 1977 through 1983.  We're tired of George Lucas changing the films on an apparent whim.  We want ALL the extras (including the ones from the DVDs and, most importantly, \\"From Star Wars to Jedi\\") included with this set.  And just so you know I'm not being a snob, I do hold degrees in film history and creative writing.  Let me tell you, it's a tough business.  Now, back to the frustration of this BD set:  These are all valid, inarguable, and absolutely true concerns.    But, you're all wrong.  Here's the thing:    1.  I think what we REALLY want is to feel the way we did when we were kids and saw \\"Star Wars\\" for the first time.  Obviously, that experience is never going to happen.  We're older.  A lot older.  And the mere fact of our maturity is going to alter our point-of-view (no, I'm not quoting Obi-Wan).  2.  For the most part, none of use has several hundred million dollars just sitting around to invest in the production of a motion picture.  George Lucas took a BIG gamble on the the first film, and he won.  He won.  He defeated 20th Century Fox and that's amazing.  This is HIS story.  True, as the audience we play a pivotal role in that story, but we didn't pick a fight with a major motion picture company.  When I get enough money, I'll tell my story, but I can't argue with marketing and capitalism as they are the foundation of American Culture (remember, we're a capitalistic republic, not a democracy).  In many ways, the fiscal and materialistic motives of our society are part of what Lucas is trying to discuss in these films.  3.  I'm almost done.  Stop whining.  Stop.  Yes, you.  I mean it.  Stop.  These films will live FAR longer than any of us, and I find comfort in that fact.  No matter how much one complains, nitpicks, or criticizes, they are very good films.  Great films even.   Directors have been changing and re-releasing films since 1895.  One example:  \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" (1925).  Two versions emerged within 24 months of each other with changes by the film's director.  Each version is worth seeing and no one complains about it.  For my part, I'm in awe of how dedicted Lucas is to his story.  He spends a lot of time, effort and, yes, money to get it right.  Like Roger Ebert, I believe films are now what they are about, but how they are about.  Knowing my great-grandchildren will be enjoying these films in a near seamless narrative is really, really exciting.  And that lightsaber duel with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul is pretty awesome too.

1400052181|5.0|Wow! What a story!  I had heard so many good things about this book & have been following this on the NYT's & SF Chronicle's Best Seller lists for paperbacks and put it on my birthday wish list.  We had heard many, many colleges used this book as their \\"Freshman Read\\" where incoming Freshmen students are asked to read it over the summer and it is discussed in every class at the college in the first 2 weeks of the Fall term.  This has us thinking to suggest it for our community college as a campus wide read for the spring semester because it could be covered onder the social sciences, physical sciences, biological sciences, science ethics reflection in chemistry & biology, toxic exposure in cosmetology & machine shop, use of math & statistics in research, the author's research methodology, the speech instructor thought it would be good for argumentation part of her class, etc. We discovered a biology instructor already was reading part of the book to her intro class. As we looked into, we found great enthusiasm from students & faculty that had already read the book. This enthusiasm caused other students who heard the discussion to get & read the book, even though no one has assigned it yet.  We have found a book to ignite the desire to read across disciplines & share the studens' enthusiasm.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Mayer Hawthorne, damn how much has Hawthorne grown in his musical abilities these past years? Few realize that MH used to be a relatively underground hip-hop DJ named DJ Haircut. Which reminds me, if you get a chance to see MH spinning records (he still does small events with friends - Jake one and MH spun at a small show in Seattle last year), be sure not to miss it.   The album: How Do You Do - Masterful. This guy has got major soul. MH wrote and produced all his music since he came on the scene with the Ain't Gonna Work Out single. The product is a refreshing, funky reflection of a really down to Earth man.  Favorites: A Long Time, The Walk, Finally Falling, No Strings.   The show: I just saw MH two days ago here in Seattle. MH is touring with Chromeo, and his performance was a top-notch dancing extravaganza. I last saw MH and the County play in Los Angeles about a year and half ago when people had no idea who he was. This past performance was amazing! The crowd swooned, swayed, and danced their hearts out.   Fun Fact: Peanut-Butter Wolf (of Stonesthrow) jump started MH's career by putting a mic in Hawthorne's face. The reserved DJ transformed into an amazing artist. MH is the first Stone's Throw artist to jump to a mainstream label (Universal).   Bottom Line: How Do You Do is an Excellent purchase (I picked it up for $10 at the show, day before release). The County (band) supporting MH is superb and on point. Make sure you pick up a couple cd's (for you and friends), and don't miss MH on tour. I am so glad that this man is picking up exposure and fanfare. He's worked damn hard to get here.   Cheers.

B005ER6SNM|3.0|WARNING: This DVD release won't be the full uncut version. Besides that, this movie will either appeal to you or won't. There likely won't be much in between. Hostel is a Disney movie compared to this. This is more along the lines of GUINEA PIG, but with more of a story.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I didn't expect myself playing further than the first box, but I just kept going once I started. I usually finished a box per night before I slept except the day I got the app and finished 2. The difficulty of the game isn't all that difficult as you can collect all the stars and unlock all the achievements with just a bit of time. But it was entertaining and I was curious to find out what other levels the develojpers could conceive of to feed Om Nom.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I always resisted buying a season's worth of Star Trek. One used to be able to buy a disc with 2 shows on it. Now you can't. I figured that bundling the whole season was a way to force consumers to buy unwanted content just to get their favorites. And maybe that's right but due to the added effects I find myself enjoying episodes I might otherwise have passed on. Its turned out to be a great value.<br /><br />Michael J.

0060775858|1.0|I really hate this book - I became so irritated with it that I threw it in the bin today so I didn't accidentally pick it up again... really really painful to read.
B004OEIL54|4.0|I thought I'd review franchise & I'll start off with scream from 1996. Directed by Wes Craven which this series isn't his best work but I like Sceam 1 & 3 2 & 4 are decent but this was the best 1. It stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquett as Officer Dewey, Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis, Rose McGowen as Tatum, Jamie Kennedy as Randy Drew Barrymoore as Casey Becker & Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Story is 1 night this girl named Casey Becker is getting ready to watch some horror movies & she's called by this guy with using a voice amplifier she keeps thinking nothing of it until he asks her for her name cause he wants to know who he's looking at. She tells him her boyfriend will kick his  a  s  s but he has her boyfriend tied up on the porch then he plays horror triva & he asks her who was the killer in Friday The 13th & she says Jason which is incorrect in the 1st it was The Mother. Her boyfriend is killed & in the Laserdisc & uncut DVD version you see his insides fall out. The killer goes after Casey outside she sees her parents coming home but she's killed in a sort of brutal way her parents find her hanging from a tree. Then your introduced to Sidney Prescott her father will be out of town for a few days so she's staying with her friend Tatum. So after school she's waiting for Tatum to pick her up & the killer calls her at 1st she thinks it's Randy a film buff. He chases her through the house & her boyfriend Billy comes up through the window a cell phone falls out of his pocket which she thinks it's Billy that killed Casey. So he's arrested & then were introduced to Officer Dewey & he's looking for Sidney's Dad that is missing they think it's Sidney Dad who's the killer. There is a sub plot involving a guy who is in prison for killing Sidney's Mom who might be innocent. Billy is let go cause they have no proof on him. Sidney is constantly hounded by Gale Weathers an Investigative Reporter she's writing a book about Sidney's Mother's  murder. Sidney punches Gale out which is a great scene. You learn she isn't too bad later on. You also have a scene in the bathroom where Sidney is attacked by the killer she barely escapes. Some students go around in Ghostface masks at school which makes The Principal mad. Then Ghostface stabs The Principal to death. A guy named Stuart is having a party & they're going to watch horror movies. So Gale & Dewey put a camera in the house to try & catch the killer. Randy explains all the components & rules to making a good slasher. You have Tatum getting some beers for the guys the killer happens to be in the garage she thinks it's a prank until she is attacked by him & the door is locked she tries to go through the doggy door thing & her death is the 1 that always stood out to me when I 1st saw Scream when I was 11. The gore is extended in the uncut version. The killer comes in Billy's stabbed a few times Sidney gets outside & Gale's camera man has his throat sliced open by Ghostface. I think it was suppose to be an extended kill. Stuart & Randy show up they yell at Sidney she doesn't know who to trust. Officer Dewey was stabbed when he went in the house. Billy comes to he shoots Randy & along with Stu it was them all along. He's doing it cause his dad had an affair with Sidney's Mom & Billy's Mother walked out on them they have Sidney's Dad & there going to pin all the murders on Sidney & her  Dad.  Gale comes in & tries to stop them but she's knocked out Sidney escapes the room while that's going on. Sidney drops The TV on Stuart's head & crushing his head. Gale comes in & shoots Billy. A wounded Randy says this is where the killer gets up for 1 last scare. Sidney takes the gun & finishes the job & says \\"Not in my movie!\\" I'm sorry if I didn't do a good job explaining the plot. But Scream is  a good movie that's better than anything Wes Craven is directing now including Scream 4. Neve Campbell is good. David Arqutte isn't bad. Courteney Cox is good. Skeet Ulrich isn't bad. Matthew Lillard was ok there entertaining & better than Emma Roberts in p4. Rose McGowen does alright. Drew Barrymoore is good for that little time she had. So next will be a sequel I'm off & on with Scream 2.
B003L77G38|5.0|This is one of the first shows that hasn't gotten worse with each season...Season 3 has not disappointed, only made me want to watch season 4 even more!!  Its a gotta-see season!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|installed it on my Asus Transformer and love playing it.  great addicting game.  Tried to install on my droid 3 and it froze when opened.  had to pull battery and uninstall to get phone to work right.
0780626966|4.0|Probably the best collection of the Original movies out there. The Re-make is obviously not included in the set. Mine is excellent other than the fact it's missing one of the pairs of 3-d glasses, that's fine especially since I bought a used set and that is the only issue.
0452287022|5.0|I wanted to see what the hype was about this book. After seeing how it was listed on so many wishlists, I figured it had to be good. It got off to a slow start for me, but it picked up quickly and I myself wrapped up in the story.<br /><br />I studied a little bit about Vermeer, during a college art class. I love art. Looking at it mostly :) So I had to go back and read up on Vermeer before I started the book. (I did however remember the paintings)<br /><br />I think this is a wonderful story, although fiction I agree it gives the girl in the painting a name, and wonderful detailed story of how it came to be. It's believeable. I love Griet's spunky attitude. It's like she is saying, I'm the maid but you will respect me!<br /><br />I recommend reading it. If you are a fan of history, art or Vermeer, I think you will enjoy it. I have to admit though, it took me a few days longer to read it..because I kept looking at the cover and gazing into her eyes, or staring at the pearl earring itself!
0439023521|4.0|I wasn't aware of the series until I started hearing about the movie, which looks interesting, so I decided to check out the books. My husband had read the first book already and was surprised when I asked to read it because it's not my usual \\"trashy romance\\" as he likes to joke. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I was a little slow getting into it and I believe it was due to the peculiar names the author uses and also trying to place where each District was located on our current map. Once I got over that, from about the time Katniss volunteered herself, I was hooked. Apart from the unusual names, the author has a very simplistic writing style and I found myself finishing the book in one sitting. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B000784WMW|5.0|I loved the movie and watch it often. Timothy   Dalton is incredible in the role of Mr. Rochester, and Zelah Clark is very good as Jane. However, the constant interuptions with chapter info is very annoying.
0545128285|4.0|They fairytales themselves are very short, and though I adore them, I would really love something a little longer and more in-depth. Also, I thought that Dumbledore's explanations were a little informal (considering that this man is a really old genius) but maybe that's just my perception of what I thought that Dumbledore should sound like. Can't help but love the stories anyway. My kids are going to say \\"Cinderella? What's that, an illness?\\" when they go to kindergarten because I will tell them these stories instead.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This was an excellent movie but very sad. Makes you realize what these people went   thru and how horribly they were treated.  I would suggest this movie for adult viewing.
B005GVA2L0|2.0|*deep sighs* I am so let down by this album. I have been waiting impatiently for the last five years for Amy Lee to bless my ears with more of her angelic melodies. This new sound from Evanescence sounds forced and fake and worst of all, it's been done before. If I wanted to hear this sound, I would just put in one of my Breaking Benjamin albums. What made Evanescence stand out among the rest was their dark and complicated sounds mixed with Amy's angelic voice and soft piano strokes. They could do no wrong. This is what happens when Amy tries not to be a `controlling' front woman and `difficult to work with.' She allows the other band members to contribute their thoughts to the songs and the songs turn out this way- generic. There are two great songs on this album: Swimming Home and Secret Door. Why can't I have more of this? Danny Elfman or Bjork, please do an album with Amy. Not only does she deserve it (it's always been her dream), but I think the fans deserve it as well.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Added an extra star just because the game itself is fun...so if you have a device it works on I do recommend it.  Sadly it crashes when I try to open it on my xoom. Would much rather play it here on my tablet than my iPhone.  Sadly looks like I'll have to stick to my iPhone version even after paying for this incompatible version...even if they fix this one, I have a feeling it will be a long time before the HD version with all the updates is released for android.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|I Couldn't watch more than 20 minutes.  There is No story.  Plenty of bad acting IMHO:   I wasted both time and money.  I just don't understand the fascination with the CGI. It tries to \\"fix\\" the problems with this movie, but it doesn't!
B0032JTV74|5.0|Great product. I believe the video is not 1080p but 720p, still the image quality is great. The songs are amazing when heard in a home theater. The extras I didn´t like very much but that´s ok.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The game.is really well made. It is simple yet complicated in a way, like.chess is. I have finished it 5 times already, yet it is still entertaining to play it over.
0765326353|4.0|I highly recommend Sanderson's The Way of Kings.  It is a great fantasy novel that will especially appeal to those looking for a break from the dark and nihilistic fantasies that are currently so popular (e.g., G. R. R. Martin).  However, TWok is heavily shaped by Sanderson's Mormonism, which may not appeal to some readers.  The two main through-stories are conversion tales (unsurprisingly, Tor's marketing makes comparisons to Ben-Hur), and the book spends considerable time wrestling with theological questions ranging from the importance of personal grooming to the nature of Being.  While this will be off-putting for some, Sanderson's characters are complex and the story engaging enough to entertain most readers regardless of their religious convictions--in this, TWoK might be best compared to books such as the Narnia books, Canticle for Leibowitz, Children of Men, the Tripod series, etc.  War and Peace is another good comparison, as the two novels share exciting battles, vivid description, and theological reflection (though Sanderson still has a ways to go to match Tolstoy's literary merit).  While I am not a Mormon, I view Sanderson's religiosity as a literary strength, not a weakness, inspiring him to dispense with many tired fantasy themes.  Fantasy generally follows one of three plot lines: good-world-threatened-by-evil; bad-world-struggling-for-good; or compelling-characters-securing-self-interest-in-gray-world.  Sanderson's novel doesn't fully fit any of these common tropes.  His world is neither terrible nor idyllic, but it is not so much grey as marbled.  There is a coming evil, but that is not what drives most of the characters.  Even with the coming storm, the characters would face the same choices between right-and-wrong.  However, as in the Mistborn books, Sanderson is fully aware these choices are not simple and what seems \\"right\\" at the time, may prove to be wrong in the long run.  Thus, TWoK focuses on the challenge of making the right decision in this \\"marbled\\" context.  Sanderson portrays life as a string of choices (\\"it is the journey, not the destination\\" is a constant refrain), and it is never too late to start trying to make the right ones.  Hence the characters and the world they inhabit are dynamic, subject to change.  This keeps you engaged as reader as you can never too quick to make assumptions about someone.  Whatever one may think of the novel's religious subtext, TWoK's ultimate appeal is this: it is a good story.  Like a good mystery, it is very well structured, dropping hints and leading you one way, only to drop a revelation that prompts you to say, \\"Of course, why didn't I see that?\\" TWoK describes a compelling world, rich with its own ecosystems, histories, and cultures.  Sanderson pulls you into this world, engaging all 5 senses.  Perhaps most importantly, he provides characters that you care about.  The book definitely has its weaknesses: some battle scenes are too long; existential crises can sound whiny; bad prose.  But overall, this is a great piece of genre-fiction and looks to be the beginning of a wonderful series.  As Literature: 3.5 (Good)  As Genre-Fiction: 4.25 (Great)
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The HD of the movies add an almost 3D feel for the prequels since they were shot digitally and the original trilogy look like they were made recently but more of a higher definition DVD clarity because movies made before digital technology can only be cleaned up so much. The bonus features are great, but if you own the DVD's keep them cause their bonus features are not on this Blu-Ray set.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I like the predictive text system.  I flashed a different ROM and used the Gingerbread keyboard rather than reloading this so far, but I like knowing that I can use SwiftKey X later, if I so choose, because it is a pretty good keyboard.  Samsung Moment
B005KXT58U|5.0|I'm rating this product as a mainstream rock album with dark elements; in which case, I'd give it five stars for production quality and vocals.  However, I will always miss their darker and \\"gothy\\" sound that their commercial debut, \\"Fallen,\\" offers.  I even enjoyed \\"The Open Door.\\"  I am not surprised that the band totally went much more mainstream with their third studio album, \\"Evanescence.\\"  More money is usually involved when artists/bands go this route, as well as more exposure.  You really can't blame them for that, since the goal of being a musician is generally to gain as much exposure as possible.  But by the same token, it's a risk when it comes to losing old fans and the sound you were once known for (though, die-hard fans will most likely stay loyal).  But these artists/bands do tend to gain new fans as well.  Anyway, enough about that!  On to the tracks!<br /><br />I'm not surprised that \\"What You Want\\" is the lead single.  It's catchy and very radio-friendly.  I would've guessed it to be the lead if I had never known it was.  \\"Made of Stone\\" will most likely be a single with its equal hook.  I predict \\"Lost in Paradise\\" to be one of the upcoming singles.  I hope so because you can never not enjoy any of Amy Lee's piano ballads (which a few of them have become singles).  This one is no exception.  \\"Swimming Home\\" is an excellent track, despite its downtempo style.  But it really captured my attention, and Amy Lee's vocals seem somewhat sultry in it.  You can definitely hear more depth when it comes to the emotions and meaning of the track.  \\"Swimming Home\\" and \\"Lost in Paradise\\" are definitely my favorites so far (I'm a fan of mysterious piano ballads and piano-heavy tracks).  The rest of the tracks are all good just from the first listen, but they are somewhat similar to each other.  I do like that the band still uses piano melodies through some of the rock tracks.<br /><br />Overall, the album is consistent, and not very many tracks stand out too much, since they all blend well together.  For those who are anti-mainstream (not that Evanescence was never mainstream to begin with), you may not care too much for this album.  But hey, I'd much rather listen to this on the radio than the likes of Britney, Katy Perry, and J.Lo (no offense to those who enjoy those artists, just not my preference).  So, yes... five stars.  There is no reason for me to give it a lower rating if I enjoyed listening to it.  At the end of the day, isn't that what's most important?<br /><br />P.S.  I still want Amy Lee to release a solo album of nothing but piano ballads.  Am I the only one who feels this way?  She'd totally be a much darker Tori, only with lyrics that wouldn't make the average radio listener's head hurt.  I don't mind my brain being wracked by advanced, intelligent storytelling, but this is top 40 we're talking about.  You can't really expect much.l blend well together.

0670034711|5.0|If you don't like books that tell the story of a person's life then don't read it! It's just common sense. Everyone who is saying that the author is selfish and her book sucks is completely ignorant. The woman wrote a book about herself and you decided to read it expecting what exactly?   Everyone has problems, and every individual's problems are real. I really enjoyed reading this book. Some advice to those who are giving bad reviews: figure out what genre works for your reading taste and stick with it.
B0042K8876|5.0|My friends got me into watching missed episodes on Amazon. It works like Netflix where I can watch an episode right on my computer. I'm glad Amazon offers this because I can't get all the episodes from Netflix instantly. I love Vampire Diaries and after watching the last season through Amazon, I think it was better than the first. I dislike admitting it, but I like the show more than the books. I want Damon to be with Elena that's why.
B005DL9O5S|5.0|Tchaikovsky finally receives the Brilliant Classics treatment. The packaging is in line with the recently up-dated Mozart, Bach and Beethoven editions. The 60 CD's (+ CD-Rom) are housed in the usual cardboard sleeves, but with a new high-gloss finish. I haven't had a chance to explore to all 60 CD's but from the few that I've sampled the recording quality and performances are pretty much consistent. Though not a \\"Complete Edition\\" it is quite comprehensive. (Five different recordings of the First Piano Concerto alone!). All are interesting in the comparative sense (but I won't be tossing Peter Donahoe's set on EMI any time soon). Which begs the question: Is this set worth acquiring for classical connoisseurs who have previously devoted serious self space to Tchaikovsky? Definitely yes! In short, it's a bargain. Could a PROKOFIEV set be next on Brilliant's agenda? ... Well, I can dream can't I??
1455510319|5.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and for the most part loved them.  Then I read a couple that weren't quite up to standard. When I read the negative reviews for \\"The Fifth Witness\\", I thought he had lost his touch and did not read it for quite some time.  Then I thought, what the heck, I'd try it. In my opinion it was terrific, incredibly detailed and realistic. Ignore the negative reviews, this is a great book.

B005G4TJUC|3.0|After all the gossip going on during the beginning of shooting on this movie when Megan Fox was nixed from being in Michael Bay's flick because of their school girl sniping at each other, it should have been a hint of the distraction of the filmmakers when this third installment got underway.  We're back with good ol' Sam Witwicki, lovable nerd and accidental hero, who manages to get a medal from Obama that he parlays into snagging a Victoria's Secret model turned actress whom he sweetly calls 'Angel'  no product placement issues there, right?  and who appears to be supporting her unemployed Sammy boy toy because he can't find a job up to his exacting requirements.  Except Sam isn't cute anymore.  He's supposed to have been through literally earth shattering experiences by this time and he's still a stumble bum, except now, he's also acquired a 'look at me and marvel' complex.  The character of Sam has not grown through his supposed experiences, hardships and losses, he's the same stammering twerp except now he's got a blonde British girlfriend with inexplicable, disturbing fish lips and a taste for whining.  His parents, who were wonderful for comic relief and context in the first two movies are barely there in this movie.  The combat team lead by Josh Duhamel show up but they've been split up and no longer all serve duty together until the extra parts hit the fan.  They introduce this new character voiced by Leonard Nimoy and then insert what apparently they believe are subtle little homage lines to Star Trek for him to use during 'pivotal' scenes in the movie that just seem like cheap tricks.  They have relied heavily on the special effects to make this movie worthwhile but even those become tedious because there is no real storyline to support it.  Again, this is an action and sci-fi movie that is meant to entertain, and it does if only because of the ocean of special effects they used to keep it going, but if you're looking for a cohesive story line to pick upwhere the first movie started and the second movie stuttered, you're going to feel cheated.  It seems that story telling has been all but forgotten in lieu of using bigger and better CGI effects and this movie is a prime example.  What began as great entertainment in the first movie faltered in the second, likely because there was such a desire to beat the first's popularity and profitability.  The result was a good movie with some strong humor.  This installment was OK, but certainly not of the caliber that you'd expect based upon some of the professional reviews from the media movie critics.  I would suggest that Michael Bay take some of the money he uses on special effects and invest in a writer who can actually write a great story to stand up to all the special effects heaped on it.  Maybe then it would be more of a must see than a 'meh'.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Sure, they got the names of the major characters in Norse mythology right, but since this is adapted from a comic book, you aren't looking for a mythology course or traditional accuracy, we're looking for entertainment and some pretty impressive special effects.  That's what you've got with this movie, and some genuninely funny moments mixed in with the action.  Some of the story telling seems thin in some areas, but the action is pretty consistent and the special effects are fun, adding to instead of overpowering the story itself.  I can see where a sequel could be a foregone conclusion because *spoiler alert* god loses pathway back to mortal girl so there is that whole unrequited love thing going on there, but with the hints of other methods of transport to and from Thor's homeworld, you have to guess that Thor will find at least one of them to get back to Jane...  It's a fun romp of a movie, great for an afternoon of distraction with a bowl of popcorn and a bunch of friends and family.  Settle in and enjoy it for what it offers, entertainment.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I have seen this program on HD broadcast, on DVD, streaming, and now Blu. I started the series streaming and decided I needed to see it on blu, and I am really glad I did. For me the biggest advantage was the sound, (DTS HD) but of course the picture looks great too. If you are new to the series or are looking to get into it, I would recommend the blu ray edition. It is a fair price and comes in good, sturdy packaging. You won't be sorry.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have to be honest, I didn't really know what to expect from this movie and what I got was a fantastically good time!<br /><br />This was just too much fun!  RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous and that is borne out as you watch the action unfurl in this deliciously dark and funny comedy.<br /><br />Frank, played by Bruce Willis, doesn't really like retirement all that much.  It's kinda boring after the life he'd led while working for the CIA.  The only thing he really enjoys is talking to his case worker at the Social Security office who takes care of his 'missing' social security checks which he has conveniently torn up so that he has a reason to call her.  They connect in a way he's never connected with women in a face to face situation and so they flirt and tease, giving Frank something to cling to.<br /><br />And then something really strange happens one night.  A wet work team all in black shows up and shoots up his house with Frank in it.  Realizing that something's up, he hits the road to find out why someone is coming after him now that he's living a life of retired obscurity and has to kidnap his Social Security crush because she's in danger, too.<br /><br />He starts looking up his old buddies from the old days, also retired now into quiet obscurity, but retired doesn't mean dead and they are all soon working together to figure out what happened to put Frank on the hot list with a bullet and then to put a stop to the plot behind the plot.<br /><br />And all the while this is going on, the girl who had been harboring her own crush on Frank and looked forward to his calls to complain about another missing check finds herself having a fantastic adventure that beats anything in the pulp romance novels that she shared with Frank.<br /><br />This was a truly fun and funny film with a great deal of plot twists and action to satisfy every movie tastebud in the family.<br /><br />And, quite frankly, any movie where Richard Dreyfus is the bad guy has something going for it!<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich round out this cast and it is Malkovich's portrayal of a slightly off the rails former agent who lives off grid and underground that adds the most hilarity to the movie.<br /><br />When the going gets tough, the tough get the pig!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm app is so good, so reliable, with so many features it should come standard on all android devices.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it in the theater when it came out and I remember being surrounded by people crying in the theater when the movie ended, men and women alike.  It is just such a great movie, a mix of comedy, mystery, action and suspense, and of course, the romance.  There is nothing about this movie that is maudlin nor frightening, the special effects surrounding Swayze's character being a ghost are neither gory nor campy.    The whole movie flows because of the relationships between the living and dead as the story unfolds and it reaches into you to make you think about the people you love and those who have gone ahead into that 'other world'.  It also gives you a great sense of comfort to know that when those we love die, their love for us doesn't die, they take it with them...  Just like we hold onto ours while we live our lives and know that someday there will be a reunion.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|I was SO impressed with this movie for a number of reasons.  I normally don't go for war movies but I like sci-fi and the blend of 'real life' and 'sci-fi alien invasion' seemed like it would be a good solid entertaining movie.  This went deeper than that.  I must say that the cast, ESPECIALLY Aaron Eckhart, was phenomenal.  They had to have spent a good chunk of time with real Marines to get the camaraderie and dedication to their fellow soldiers down the way they did.  The plot of having aliens invade for our water is fine, it gives an explanation why they'd target our planet, but the movie is really about this group of Marines who are tasked with getting the last civilians out of Los Angeles before they take bombers in to level the alien menace creeping in from the Pacific.  You get a real visceral feel for these soldiers and their committment to each other and duty, that no matter how terrified they are in the face of an unknown enemy with unknown weaknesses, that they continue to dig in and fight with everything they have.  Courage, determination, ingenuity and heart.  They protect the civilians, children and adult, and the best part is that the civilian adults step up to help when and where they can with whatever expertise or skills they have that might help the Marines gain the upper hand and give everyone a chance of surviving the morning.  There is fast paced action, special effects and truly wonderful acting, which makes this a trifecta winner in my opinion.  It will appeal to everyone in your family, although I would caution to pre-screen if you've got younger children.  I think the best thing that can be said about this movie beyond its entertainment factor is the realistic view it gives you of the courage and strength our soldiers have to do what they do for us when battling our own home grown terrestrial evil.
0307887960|5.0|I will keep this review very simple. This diet worked for me.<br /><br />I am only 5 feet tall and, since the age of 15, have always been a very careful, healthy eater and a regular exerciser.  However, in the past ten years, my weight just continued to creep higher and higher.  No matter how much I tried, I simply could not lose the weight. I had my hormones checked and my thyroid checked and just about everything else checked and the weight simply continued to pile on slowly and regularly.<br /><br /> Please don't say that a \\"better\\" diet and \\"more exercise\\" would have worked. It simply did NOT work for me, and my diet was about as balanced, low-fat, and healthy as a diet could be and I walked and exercised nearly every single day. Yet, I got fatter and more sluggish as time went on.<br /><br /> All those scientists and nutritionists and doctors out there who are telling people not to follow the Dukan Diet, please tell me why I gained so much weight if I ate only good foods,  watched my calories carefully, never (and I do mean never) ate junk, and exercised regularly? Was I supposed to accept the theory that it was \\"menopause\\" or \\"aging\\" or something else that I couldn't control?<br /><br />Out of sheer desperation,and thanks to a suggestion from my sister, I bought The Dukan Diet book and I started the diet.  I have lost 22 pounds, and I now weigh about what I weighed when I was only 18!! I went from a size 8 to a size 4 (and sometimes 2), I have energy and muscle tone, and I feel great.<br /><br />There are some carbohydrates in this diet (the oat bran and wheat bran) and there are also the natural sugars that occur in the dairy products that (thankfully) are \\"allowed\\" on the diet.  In the third phase, one would add in fruits, pasta, bread, etc., once again.<br /><br />I am now in the third phase of the diet, in which these foods are added back in.<br /><br />While I would guess that this diet could be quite unhealthy if you stayed on it forever, this is really a short-term diet with a long-term plan for healthy eating and weight maintenance. Everything that Pierre Dukan says in the book makes a lot of sense to me. I am not a doctor, not a scientist, and not a nutritionist.  However, I don't know a single person who went on a calorie-restricted diet and did not gain the weight back after reaching his/her weight goal and then eating like a normal person again.<br /><br /> It makes sense to me that if you go on a calorie-restricted diet for a period of time and simply resume eating regularly after you lose weight, you will most likely gain the weight back.  If you use the Dukan Diet, follow the diet through its first two phases, and then begin to add foods back in slowly, it seems to make sense that you will most likely maintain your weight.  Better yet, you will have accomplished something wonderful and focused on your health and well-being as well as on your eating styles.<br /><br />What I liked best about this diet, besides the fact that it WORKED, is that non-fat dairy products are allowed (and there is a lot to choose from these days) and certain soy-based burgers are allowed.  Additionally, the first phase, the attack phase, in which you eat only proteins, is really for only a short time. Then, you can add in vegetables once again.<br /><br />I did not like many of the recipes in the book; however, by reading the ingredients, I was able to create recipes that worked and still fit within the parameters of the diet. For example, I could not stomach the thought of the Dukan Pizza with salmon; however, I took the portion of the recipe that made the \\"pizza crust\\" and made two pancake-sized crusts instead. I was able to use that like bread, and darned if it didn't satisfy any desire for bread!<br /><br />I am proud of myself for accomplishing my weight loss goal, and I am thankful to Pierre Dukan for creating and sharing this very easy to follow diet.<br /><br />By the way, I found the Dukan approach to be less boring thanwhat I was doing every day before I started the diet.  Want to know why?  Because I IMMEDIATELY began to lose weight!  Losing weight by eating every day and walking for only 20 or 30 minutes was surely a lot easier and more exciting than counting/restricting calories, taking an aerobics class, and wondering how much more I would weigh the next day despite watching what I ate and exercising.<br /><br />Following a particular diet is a very personal choice, and many of my friends took one look at this book and said they couldn't possibly follow this diet.  I found it easy to follow.<br /><br />Because I am still in the third phase of the diet, I honestly cannot comment on the long-term result.  However, I can, with all honesty, say that, if it weren't for the Dukan Diet, I would still be 22 pounds heavier!what I was doing every day before I started the diet.  Want to know why?

B001C08RHA|5.0|Okay, so I must confess I am not a comic book afficionado so I was blissfully unaware of the Iron Man comic series, but I don't think you need to know the comic strip to enjoy this movie immensely, because I did.<br /><br />I love the quirkiness that Robert Downey, Jr. brought to the character and that he's more than just a spoiled genius with unlimited financial resources, he's got a conscience and he's determined to do right in the world.<br /><br />The special effects are great but they don't overpower the storyline, which is a wonderful change of pace because the story can hold its own, even without all of the special Iron Man CGI stuff.<br /><br />The interplay between the two main characters, Trask and Rhodes, is believable and you see how much both men care for and respect each other.<br /><br />The character of Pepper is tedious and a bit whiney, but that might simply be what Ms. Paltrow bring to the part.<br /><br />This movie was a refreshing and very pleasant surprise, which makes me want to see how the sequel is handled...  In fact, I think I'll put it in the DVD player right now and see how well they did!<br /><br />It was a surprise to find a really great, entertaining movie and not feel like I had to endure the heaps and gobs of special effects to get back to the actual story.  I cannot recommend this movie enough for the sheer enjoyment of being entertained without being patronized or bombarded with loud explosions and foul language.<br /><br />This is a true gem of a movie.

B005FFW46S|5.0|I was excited to read the latest Discworld installment, mainly because I love the Watch story lines.  I was not disappointed.  This ambitious, action and humor packed story was an epic journey filled with beloved characters, both familiar and new.  The addition of another species and its culture was intriguing, and it's one of the things Sir Terry excels in;  introducing new and complex societies and engendering sympathy and understanding for their challenges.  The goblins are wretched and unloved, their main religious activity being preserving their bodily fluids in hand made pots.  Yet, by the end of the journey, our heart breaks for the goblins and their plight, and we rejoice in their luck in finding a champion in Sam Vimes.  He has a soft spot for the dregs of society, having been one himself for much of his life.<br />Of course, it's always fun to see old friends, and Discworld characters are no exception.  The Patrician is acidic, calculating and brilliant as ever (his rivalry with the Times crossword editor is escalating nicely) and many characters are treated to much development and are evolving in fascinating ways.  Interestingly, Fred Colon just may have grown and changed the most, despite his best efforts.  I was also interested to see the Summoning Dark featuring prominently.  Sybil, Willikins, Lord Rust, and even Nobby become stronger, more defined characters and Even Brother Oats gets a mention (he is one of my favorite side characters, so I enjoy seeing the occasional mention of his work).  The new characters are great too, with the exception of Stratford, the villain, who was really kind of thin and seemed to just be a plot device, and not much of one at that.<br />On the whole, Snuff is at least as good as Thud, and just a really fun, exciting, though-provoking read.  I'm so happy that Sir Terry is still well enough to continue his great work, and I wish him continuing health and wellbeing.
B005IS565S|5.0|This CD is amazing.  At first I was a little hesitant.  I loved the last 2 CD's and have listening to them for so long that the first run thru sounded so weird.  But after 2 more run thrus I LOVE IT!!!!!   The vocals from Ivan are as awesome as ever. There is still the 5FDP edge to all of the songs!
B0053TMP24|4.0|As I've read a bunch of great reviews on the book already, I'm writing this more as a complaint than anything else.<br />I'm a huge fan of the Percy Jakson Series. The Lost Hero got me so excited (it is my favorite so far, including the original series) that I pre-ordered The Son of Neptune as soon as the kindle version was avaiable for pre-order, some 3 or 4 months ago.<br />Now, if I had known that the archive would come with that many typos, I confess I'd have waited. Honestly, there was one every 2 or 3 pages, on average, which is absolutely unacceptable. I do know that Amazon has already sent a corrected archive but, lets face it, I had already finished the book by then. Also, the fact that the corrections were made that quickly makes me think there is a fair chance the publisher is actually using readers to give feedback on that, that's to say, we are paying to be beta-readers!!!!<br />I've learnt my lesson: next time I'm gonna wait a week or so before I order mine.

B00004Y87O|4.0|This is a good adventure film. It maintains a nice quick pace. Kurt Russell is surrounded by some superb support actors and actresses with a fine script and good direction. It's not science fiction like Blade Runner or Alien. It's better than fair but short of an excellent adventure film.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie.  Having read and adored `Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close', I have since been living on this cloud where everything written by or inspired of Jonathan Safran Foer must be luminous; even though I have yet to broach any of his other work (I have them all sitting on my shelf, but there are so many books that need to be read that prioritizing is very difficult for me).  So, with that in mind, I embarked on soaking in the film adaptation for `Everything is Illuminated', Foer's first shot at fame and one that he is often remembered for.  The novel received considerably good reviews, and while I remember the film receiving less than stellar remarks I was still interested in seeing this for myself.<br /><br />I'm scared.<br /><br />The reason I say `I'm scared' is that I am highly anticipating the film adaptation of `Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' and after watching Foer's lyrical style misrepresented on film here I'm nervous that it just isn't an easy translation.  Foer writes with such ferocity, such unique and obscure energy.  He hints at humor with embellished gimmicks that feel rooted in something real; human.  That feeling is betrayed in the uneven way in which `Everything is Illuminated' is filmed.  I remember having a similar feeling when watching `American Psycho' (two drastically different films, but my point is the same).  Bret Easton Ellis's novel was so rich with subtle subtext that rode the line of hilarious yet never crossed that line, always inhabiting itself with something completely serious in tone.  The film held that for the first half and then let go into complete chaos and lunacy to the point where Ellis's entire `message' was lost.  While I have not read the novel, I feel that I understand Foer's stylistic approach and so I feel that this film doesn't really do that approach any justice.  The first half is basically a comedy that isn't very funny, that tries to translate Foer's style to the screen verbatim (which is never a good thing) and so it becomes awkward.  Then, when things become `illuminated', the film takes a strangely serious tone that undermines the entire tone of the first three quarters.  Doing this takes the guts of the story and makes them feel unnatural.  They don't fit and so they feel `off'.  This is a shame because it is in those moments that the heart of the story is exposed, and that heart isn't given the tender affection it deserved because the audience is left bewildered at the first half of the film.<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />There are some very strong facets of this film though.  The score is delightful.  It is flirtatious and whimsical and yet poignant and, when necessary, it is heartfelt.  The cinematography has moments of blissful wonderment, and Lista's home alone is a brilliant showcase in art direction.  Of the performances, one truly shines.  Boris Leskin is sensational as the crazy `thinks he's blind' grandfather harboring a dark secret behind his stereotypical demeanor.  He layers his `crankiness' with a soulfulness that is brought to full fruition as the film draws to a close.<br /><br />Wood is semi-effective, but the role is rather one-note and more observational than anything else; and Hutz is awful (but apparently that is my opinion and my opinion only).<br /><br />In the end, `Everything is Illuminated' has its moments, and the second half is far better than the first, but where style is often used effectively on the written page, it runs the risk of appearing gimmicky and forced on the big screen and sadly, that is what has happened here.hing) and so it becomes awkward.

0316098337|5.0|I was hesitant at first to buy this book because of the plot.  I thought it would be horrifying and depressing.  Although it conveys the terrible aspects of Jack and Ma's plight, the book is so beautiful in the way it communicates the bond between mother and child.  I fell in love with Jack after the first paragraph.  Any mother of a five year old boy will be able to relate to Jack (and Ma's fierce and protective love for him).  Jack's innocence and pleasure in the simple things in life made me fall in love with him instantly.  I loved Emma Donoghue's use of Jack's narrative to tell the story.  It makes the book unique and endearing, despite the horror of the plot.  The book makes you keep thinking about it days after you are finished.    This book is way on top of my 10 best-ever books list.
0670022950|5.0|Jim Newman, Louise's spouse, here.<br /><br />There is a tendency for generations to envision aporia, endgame, or final justice. FL Watkins claimed that while we were the first generation physically able to sterilize the world through nuclear annihilation many societies could visualize the utter collapse of their world as they knew it. Bounded by geology or geography or all-inclusive culture or even dispersed by diaspora the end of the world was near and total in finality. Many of my friends bemoan often the horrible increase of violence today, They fear kidnapping, rape, and murder as if it were imminent and lock their kids inside or trade them odd car to car, door to door.<br /><br />Pinker demonstrates with some 200 charts and graphs and nearly 800 pages of text we are in a decrease of violence. Violence has been declining for the last several thousand years. Tribal warfare was 9 times greater than 20th century violence. The murder rate in medieval Europe was 30 times greater than today. It's working!  I am relieved and optimistic. I was born with the polarity of nuclear discovery. Nuclear power could eliminate all hunger and energy needs, forever. Nuclear bombs could sterilize the earth, in an hour.<br /><br />For all of our modern fear of increasing kidnapping, rape, murder and war now is the best time to live. Late in the book in the subchapter \\"Reflections\\" Pinker notes \\"A loathing of modernity is one of the great constants of contemporary social criticism.  Whether the nostalgia is for small-town intimacy, ecological sustainability, communitarian solidarity, family values, religious faith, primitive communism, or harmony with the rhythms of nature, everyone longs to turn back the clock. What has technology given us they say, but alienation, despoliation, social pathology, the loss of meaning, and a consumer culture that is destroying the planet to give us McMansions, SUVs, and Reality Television?\\"<br /><br />Yet, there is less violence. Even more. We have had a world food surplus. The workplace is so rich we have OSHA laws and unions are being negated; 40 hr work weeks and mandatory safety equipment for the smallest of particulate matter. We have a black president named Obama. Yes, the financial crisis is a zoo but no one has killed Obama or John Stewart. Is violence a sign of well being? If no one were killed but everyone were oppressed?<br /><br />The last sentimental card drawn after many debates has been the profusion of violence in modern times. The lack of well being rooted in the physicality of violence. Yet, violence by any measure has gone down considerably. Writers who have noted the decrease in violence express puzzlement as to why. Tempting to reach for a nebulous divinity, cosmic author, almost magic, or higher power as Robert Wright and Stephen Payne infer. Rather, Stephen asserts \\"forces of modernity--reason, science, humanism, individual rights\\" are the cause for this peripatetic but nevertheless positive trajectory towards peace.<br /><br />The beginning spends considerable time demonstrating the violence of the past. For most historians it doesn't take much critical examination to get that rape, murder, slavery, kidnapping, and physical abuse were plentiful as found in the archaeology and literature of the past whether biblical, greco-roman, medieval chivalry, or even hunter-gatherer societies.<br /><br />Hunter-gatherer societies in particular raise sentiment to a high fever. It is tempting to extrapolate the journals of the early Spaniards eulogizing specific HG cultures like the Coastal California, Florida, and Japanese areas where resources remained plentiful and various tribes, Chumash, Ohlone, and PreCalusa lived the good life. Though they traded off death by warfare with, for example, grizzly attacks, the biggest killer of California Coastal Native Americans. HG societies having found internal peace may still be plagued by other contingencies of their environment and ideology. Tempting too to extrapolate the low hours required by HG societies to sustain themselves, 2-4 hrs per day versus the 10-12 of modern man. Would you trade a life duration of 40 versus 70 if you only had to work 2-4 hrs per day?<br /><br />But these examples do not scale or universalize easily and their exceptionalism is notable as means of supporting potential benefits but also require geographic, geologic, and cultural boundaries not likely to ever be seen again. Alfred Krober notes in the over 1,000 tribes of California tribes cultural mores range from slavery to freedom, money to barter, peace to full warfare, stability to nomadism. This hodge podge of cultures serves as excellent idea sources but not as scalable models easily obtained by modern society. The Society of Primitive Technology and works by Norm Kidder and Pegg Mathewson as well as myself have shown the ease of living off the land but that is irrelevant to the contingencies of living together.<br /><br />While there are good examples of a less intensive life style with a surplus of free time for gaming, story-telling, and time consuming functional art work it is no guarantee against violence. For years I listened to the debate about Anasazi and cliff dwellers. Whether those painful cliff climbs were for defense or some perverse kind of architecture. It has been with great difficulty that even trained anthropologists could accept such ritualized violence. We deeply want to believe in an Eden, primitive purity, at some time or that humans are basically peaceful but easily corrupted. Consider the rejection of Lorenz's Territorial Imperative or Adler's will to power. Such a dream is a balm to the everyday violence we experience and see as our own and worse than all before.<br /><br />Hobbes exaggerated the solitary tooth and fang aspect of the precivilized world but as Pinker quotes Hobbes commenting on the logic of violence of one intelligent species to another \\"So that in the nature of man, we find three principles of quarrel. First competition; secondly diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first maketh men invade for gain; the second for safety; and the third for reputation. The first use violence, to make themselves masters of other men's persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second to defend them; the third. for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their persons or by reflection in their kindred, their friends, their nation, their profession, or their name.\\"<br /><br />Hobbes' solution is that a tyrant of the most vicious sort is better than precivilized life. He completely misses the boat for democracy and commerce but nails the problem on its head. Reputation is the most critical aspect most undervalued as a human motivator. It is not resource depletion so much that encourages internal warfare but the unabated zeal for reputation and status as a means of ensuring competitive and defensive success over time. While R. Buckminster Fuller said boredom breeds creativity it is not true unless within a structure of accomplishment. Boredom leads to negative group dynamics. Time needs to be filled with activity or humans turn to each other for entertainment and it is often cruel, Machiavellian at best, to preserve or enhance reputation.<br /><br />Jim Riggs ran an aboriginal living skills program where individuals learn HG material culture and then survive on the land. It is a twisted unreal game as the skills involved take time years for expertise and the environment is bleak. Nevertheless there is considerable leisure time. I have met a number of these students, some Phd anthropologists, and the complaint I heard the most was not being hungry, not being tired, but the difficulty of group dynamics.<br /><br />In the end the greatest difficulty of living together is interpersonal relationship. Jared Diamond writes of an annual meeting between tribes and notes an exceptionally difficult time when a wronged member repeatedly,yearly, raises anger of a past wrong to his family. For the sake of reputation of a single member the only intertribal meeting for a year is hijacked. Other members, peacemakers, assuage the wrong feeling but with difficulty.<br /><br />Resource rich tribes of the Pacific Northwest arrived at a culture of totem and potlatch one upmanship where status was based on the impoverishment of families by giving away everything and more. No longer the hunter coming home and sharing the meat but a drive to wanton excess no different than the missionaries in Mexico/Central America plundering all resource and capital to destitution to render ever larger missions in an absurd competition. The former no longer having anything to do with egalitarianism and the latter having nothing to do with God's word.<br /><br />Pinker notes Laura Betzig who has shown that \\"complex societies tend to fall under the control of despots; leaders who are guaranteed to get their way in conflicts, who can kill with impunity, and who have large harems of women at their disposal.\\" Pinker adds \\"People were less likely to become victims of homicide or casualties of war, but they were now under the thumbs of tyrants, clerics, and kleptomaniacs.\\" Not until the enlightenment, democracy, and individual rights will there be a cultural ideology that lowers the desire for violence.<br /><br />Glossing over several dense chapters discussing the flow of violence Pinker resets his path in \\"Inner Demons\\". Sadism, Masochism, ostracizing, excommunication, all contribute to violence yet seem to be part of the nature of man. It is tempting to either say someone is evil or they are the victim of their passions. Neither is correct. A keen insight is revenge.<br /><br />In various experiments and games revenge does have an advantage but only at cost. \\"Revenge can work as a deterrent only if the avenger has a reputation for being willing to avenge and a willingness to carry it out even when it is costly.\\" The other side of reputation is just punishment.<br /><br />Pinker quotes Daly and Wilson \\"The enormous volume of mystico-religious bafflegab about atonement and penance and divine justice and the like is the attribution to higher, detached authority of what is actually a mundane pragmatic matter; discouraging self-interested competitive acts by reducing their profitability to nil.\\" The danger is the escalation of revenge. Innocence is exaggerated as is their adversary's malice.<br /><br />Too often we punish more and more severely way past the pragmatic end of prevention. The way out \\"The desire for revenge is most easily modulated when the perpetrator falls within our natural circle of empathy. We are apt to forgive our kin and close friends for trespasses that would be unforgivable in others. And when our circle of empathy expands...our circle of of forgivability expands with it\\"<br /><br />Men strive for dominance. People are overconfident of their success. In contests of dominance parties are no longer sorted by merit. People can overcome the revulsion of violence but seek it and privatize it as in S & M games and worse. \\"And people can avow a belief they don't hold purely because they think everyone else avows it; such beliefs can sweep through a closed society and bring it under the spell of collective delusion.\\"<br /><br />The chapter \\"Better Angels\\" is a pleasure to read. It is the optimist's antidote. The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist is afraid that it is true. What is it that has allowed us to reject violence? What are the underlying forces of democracy, commerce, and individual rights that make them work?<br /><br />Empathy, sympathy, understanding, and compassion all encourage the expanding circle of self. The facile mantra of oneness is annoying but its merit is the desire for inclusion. Pinker rightly notes \\"What really has expanded is not so much a circle of empathy as a circle of rights--a commitment that other living things, no matter how distant or dissimilar, be safe from harm or exploitation.\\"<br /><br />Peter Singer does not use empathy or emotion to expand the circle of self; Singer coined the phrase. Reason is sufficient. It is reason that expands the circle beyond self, family, nation, and species and not rubbing shoulders or the imagining of rubbing shoulders. It makes sense to include others.<br /><br />Commerce encourages empathy, or at least sex and drinking together. The trade routes of the world are littered with Romeo and Juliet stories. Business cuts through class and preference. Trade encourages integration. Physical contact encourages acceptance of varying views. People will engage in commerce as an excuse to socialize. Integration works but is not initially accepted except by a big carrot like commerce.<br /><br />Self control. \\"Economists have noted that when people are left to their own devices, they save far too little for their retirement, as if they expected to die in a few years. \\" Pinker spends considerable time supporting Elias that self-control and violence are related. Furthermore that practicing self-control and impulse-control lowers violence. This is mostly a futuristic chapter with ideas and plans best stated \\"It's also possible that people can learn strategies of self control, enjoy the feeling of mastery over their impulses, and transfer their newfound tricks of discipline from one part of their behavioral repertoire over another.\\" Apparently we have room for improvement here.<br /><br />The historic difficulty is the compulsion to prioritize present needs over future needs. In the past delaying gratification removed motivation to action now for immediate survival. Now, delaying gratification benefits future states. It is as if the extent of reputation has extended far into the future. Grandparents, oral tradition, writing, and governance are all means of allowing the individual to extend the perception of life into the future. Overall, Pinker calls this the Civilizing Process. Who would have guessed that we would live beyond the reproductive phase?<br /><br />Moral process. Pinker quotes Fiske and Tetlock \\"Over the last three centuries throughout the world there has been a rapidly accelerating tendency of social systems as a whole to move from Communal Sharing to Authority Ranking to Equality Matching to Market Pricing\\" Further Pinker writes \\"The trend towards social liberalism, then is a trend away from communal and authoritarian values and towards values based on equality, fairness, autonomy, and legally enforced rights.\\" Haidt has researched this and many chafe that conservatives are authority, purity, and loyalty based but the up side is that conservatives no longer invoke authority, tradition, or religion to justify racism, female domesticity, and gay bashing. Or at least not as much as they did.<br /><br />Reason takes a dive in society now but the interesting point is the proliferation of reasoning and arguments to accomplish the goal. Derrida, Foucault, and Barthes did not opine from the heart and emote their intuitions. Some of the most extravagant and difficult arguments come from postmodernism. Neuroscience has used tremendous amounts of reason to show how we are biased as do economists. Never has reason been abandoned but rather if anything fetishized. Only conservative authority adherence discussions abandon reason for abeyance.<br /><br />The best part of this chapter was a note on Hume. Many people think Hume refers to rationalizations. That people follow passions and support with reason. Pinker rightly notes \\"...he was not advising people to shoot from the hip, blow their stack, or fall head over heels for Mr Wrong. He was basically making the logical point that reason, by itself, is just a means of getting from one true proposition to the next and does not care about the value of the propositions.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless reason according to Pinker allows us to modify self control and moral sense. What is important here is that reasoning leads to accuracy.

I present that we are more sensitive to death in numbers than ever before. The battle of Antietem took 23,000 lives in one day. 9/11 a tenth of that. Our wars now measure casualties in double digits rather than thousands or tens of thousands. Our sensibility towards individual death is now so great that we watch the news of murders with the same kind of anger we reserved for battles.<br /><br />This heightened sensitivity shows how far we have progressed. We too should close with Pinker \\"For all of the tribulations in our lives, for all of the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible.\\"the like is the attribution to higher, detached authority of what is actually a mundane pragmatic matter; discouraging self-interested competitive acts by reducing their profitability to nil.\\" The danger is the escalation of revenge. Innocence is exaggerated as is their adversary's malice.  Too often we punish more and more severely way past the pragmatic end of prevention. The way out \\"The desire for revenge is most easily modulated when the perpetrator falls within our natural circle of empathy. We are apt to forgive our kin and close friends for trespasses that would be unforgivable in others. And when our circle of empathy expands...our circle of of forgivability expands with it\\"  Men strive for dominance. People are overconfident of their success. In contests of dominance parties are no longer sorted by merit. People can overcome the revulsion of violence but seek it and privatize it as in S & M games and worse. \\"And people can avow a belief they don't hold purely because they think everyone else avows it; such beliefs can sweep through a closed society and bring it under the spell of collective delusion.\\"  The chapter \\"Better Angels\\" is a pleasure to read. It is the optimist's antidote. The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist is afraid that it is true. What is it that has allowed us to reject violence? What are the underlying forces of democracy, commerce, and individual rights that make them work?  Empathy, sympathy, understanding, and compassion all encourage the expanding circle of self. The facile mantra of oneness is annoying but its merit is the desire for inclusion. Pinker rightly notes \\"What really has expanded is not so much a circle of empathy as a circle of rights--a commitment that other living things, no matter how distant or dissimilar, be safe from harm or exploitation.\\"   Peter Singer does not use empathy or emotion to expand the circle of self; Singer coined the phrase. Reason is sufficient. It is reasonthat expands the circle beyond self, family, nation, and species and not rubbing shoulders or the imagining of rubbing shoulders. It makes sense to include others.  Commerce encourages empathy, or at least sex and drinking together. The trade routes of the world are littered with Romeo and Juliet stories. Business cuts through class and preference. Trade encourages integration. Physical contact encourages acceptance of varying views. People will engage in commerce as an excuse to socialize. Integration works but is not initially accepted except by a big carrot like commerce.  Self control. \\"Economists have noted that when people are left to their own devices, they save far too little for their retirement, as if they expected to die in a few years. \\" Pinker spends considerable time supporting Elias that self-control and violence are related. Furthermore that practicing self-control and impulse-control lowers violence. This is mostly a futuristic chapter with ideas and plans best stated \\"It's also possible that people can learn strategies of self control, enjoy the feeling of mastery over their impulses, and transfer their newfound tricks of discipline from one part of their behavioral repertoire over another.\\" Apparently we have room for improvement here.  The historic difficulty is the compulsion to prioritize present needs over future needs. In the past delaying gratification removed motivation to action now for immediate survival. Now, delaying gratification benefits future states. It is as if the extent of reputation has extended far into the future. Grandparents, oral tradition, writing, and governance are all means of allowing the individual to extend the perception of life into the future. Overall, Pinker calls this the Civilizing Process. Who would have guessed that we would live beyond the reproductive phase?  Moral process. Pinker quotes Fiske and Tetlock \\"Over the last three centuries throughout the world there has been a rapidly accelerating tendency of social systems as a whole to move from Communal Sharing to Authority Ranking to Equality Matching to Market Pricing\\" Further Pinker writes \\"The trend towards social liberalism, then is a trend away from communal and authoritarian values and towards values based on equality, fairness, autonomy, and legally enforced rights.\\" Haidt has researched this and many chafe that conservatives are authority, purity, and loyalty based but the up side is that conservatives no longer invoke authority, tradition, or religion to justify racism, female domesticity, and gay bashing. Or at least not as much as they did.  Reason takes a dive in society now but the interesting point is the proliferation of reasoning and arguments to accomplish the goal. Derrida, Foucault, and Barthes did not opine from the heart and emote their intuitions. Some of the most extravagant and difficult arguments come from postmodernism. Neuroscience has used tremendous amounts of reason to show how we are biased as do economists. Never has reason been abandoned but rather if anything fetishized. Only conservative authority adherence discussions abandon reason for abeyance.   The best part of this chapter was a note on Hume. Many people think Hume refers to rationalizations. That people follow passions and support with reason. Pinker rightly notes \\"...he was not advising people to shoot from the hip, blow their stack, or fall head over heels for Mr Wrong. He was basically making the logical point that reason, by itself, is just a means of getting from one true proposition to the next and does not care about the value of the propositions.\\"   Nevertheless reason according to Pinker allows us to modify self control and moral sense. What is important here is that reasoning leads to accuracy. Bad arguments, bad inferences, and bad premises are more easily sorted out by reason.  The growth of education and the expanse of reason leads to less violence. \\"It is not a big leap to conclude that an education-fueled rise in reasoning ability made at least some parts of the world safe for democracy. Democracy by definition is associated with less government violence, and we know that is statistically associated with an aversion to interstate war, deadly ethnic riots, and genocide, and with a reduction in the severity of civil wars.\\"  In \\"On Angel's Wings\\" Pinker makes a strong supposition for protective government or the Leviathan. \\"A state that uses a monopoly on force to protect its citizens from one another may be the most consistent violence-reducer that we have encountered in this book...A Leviathan--or his female counterpart--Justitia, the goddess of justice--is a disinterested party whose penalties are not inflated by the self serving biases of the participants, and who is not a deserving target of revenge.\\" By imposing a cost that is greater than the benefit a governance can make peace more attractive than agression.  Feminization. Acknowledging Yamaguchi the only survivor of both atomic bombs \\"The only people who should be allowed to govern countries with nuclear weapons are mothers , those who are still breast feeding their babies.\\" Furthermore \\"Several varieties of feminization, then--direct political empowerment, the deflation of manly honor, the promotion of marriage on women's terms, the rights of girls to be born, and women's control over their own reproduction--have been forces in the decline of violence.\\" This is a long way from the biblical admonishment that a rapist must marry his victim.

B003L77GH4|4.0|This show is one of the best I've seen. The 1st season was a bit slow and dragging, but the 2nd season made up for that with a more complicated and exciting plot, tons of new and sexy characters and new relationships. It goes into way more depth about the Salvatores and about Katherina's past, it even shows her spekaing Bulgarian from when she was human! I absolutely loved how they put in so many flashbacks, it made the story easier to understand because it can get a little confusing at times. The only complaint I have is that I got it late and the case was broken on the inside. This show is definitely worth watching, I'm recording the 3rd season on my DVR as we speak!
B002QY9RMA|5.0|enjoyable cd. first several tracks nice easy listening. my second experience with Beyonce and definitely my favorite so far. its a favorite of mine immediately
B003XRELEI|5.0|I found this book thought provoking and hilarious. I really enjoy the writers easy style. The character development was excellent. All these parallel lives summing into one big crazy soup.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|For a book that is marketed towards the young readers market, the plot in The Death Cure is rather convoluted, and altogether irrational.  The so called \\"answers\\" provided are nothing more than definitions--i.e. what is the killzone?  what is the flare?  The Death Cure is a book that can easily frustrate the impatient reader.<br /><br />Altruistically, the author, through the main protagonist Thomas, notes early on that Wicked cannot be trusted.  And sure enough, the gang of Gladers are given half truths and shepherded along the directions as secretly guided by Wicked.  From the author's perspective, Thomas' past is irrelevant, and other prominent characters like Theresa are irrelevant (hence the almost zero character development).  The only relevant question is how will humanity survive the Flare?  And towards this final objective, the author offers a brilliant solution, as revealed in the Epilogue.<br /><br />The Death Cure is very well written, with hair tearing twists and turns in the story.  It provides a fitting end to the rather memorable and quite re-readable Maze Runner Trilogy series.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Of all the games I've downloaded on my phone, this is the first one I ever actually beat. Normally I only play games on my phone when I'm bored or trying to pass time waiting somewhere, but this game I actually found myself playing it at home when there was other stuff I could be doing. I haven't encountered any of the problems other people have had. Its a very fun and extremely addicting game. My favorite game on my phone.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever watched. The survival skills and tons of luck this man had were unbelievable. Great performances by all. Highly recommended!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Always been a fan of Cyndi.  Saw her on a talk show one night where she sang one of her blues songs and was impressed.  Thought I would give the CD a try.  WOW! If you like blues you'll love this one.  The girl of the '80s has grown into a full fledged 21st century blues woman. The song 'Early in the Morning' is a good example of Cyndi's fun side.  There of course are some real down home blues too, such as 'Just Your Fool' and 'Romance in the Dark'.  Great musical back up which includes B.B. King on one track.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is another great duet collection featuring Tony and has many talented friends.  His voice is still as strong and smooth as ever.  The variety of familiar and new favorites in beautifully arranged numbers frame the vocal skills of Bennett and his singing partners perfectly.
B003L77GH4|1.0|This product came extremely quick (which was a plus) but when starting to view it, the 1st disc was perfect but the 2nd disc and last disc were very scratched. It looked like a cat had dragged its paws across the disc, and it was completely unviewable.
0385737947|5.0|This book was so good I read it in one day. Literally. I've only done that once before. Now my spine is twisted from sitting in this position for so long. I will be getting the sequal immediately.
B00466HN86|5.0|This was a very heart warming movie and it will touch everyones lives. I loved this movie I would recommended to anyone.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Bought this watch for a do it all watch. I hate replacing watch batteries and thought I would get this as it says in the description that it is WR to 300FT. I don't plan on being 300 ft under water, but would like to be able to leave it on while canoeing or swimming. After receiving the watch I can not find where it says any water resistance rating on the watch. I think that is misleading. Read all the reviews and found that I am not alone in this regard. I will not return it, nor will I worry about it. Will re-post a review if it ever fails due to water.   As far as accuracy, it seems to lose about a minute and a half a week. Maybe I am not moving around enough ;-). Seems ok to me, I am never needing to the second accuracy anyway. Watch is a good size, not too big like some watches I see, and not too small either. Luminous dial works fine, seems to stay lit enough for me to read it in the middle of the night. For $56 bucks it was a good buy.
0345529057|5.0|Literally flew though these books at the pace of about a book a week. Until I started school. Then my world fell apart. These are some of the BEST books about intrigue and the stories and characters are just great great great.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I have had no problems with this purchase. I'll be looking for Press Play for any and all DVD purchases from now on. I\\"m recommending Press Play to all my friends whom want a DVD.
0525423281|1.0|I was really disappointed with this story. The main character, Lola, is sleeping with her 22 year old rocker boyfriend. She \\"lost her virginity on her seventeenth birthday\\" to him. There were several scenes in which sex was very briefly described with this guy: Location: Back of a van: \\"I kiss him hard. He pushes back harder. It doesn't take long. We collapse.\\"   I just don't think this is good storytelling. I think it is sad that this book is being pushed for teens when it has that type of content.
0321344758|5.0|I recently have started trying to break into the web design field, and a major struggle of mine and many other beginning designers is well the layout aspect.  I felt I was struggling with just general ideas for layouts.    Don't Make Me Think gave me a nudge in the right direction. Before reading this book I never even considered Information Architecture to be a viable career path for myself.  After reading this book I have started devouring everything I can find on the subject.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who has started learning about web design and is getting ready to take the training wheels off, or to anyone who is intimidated but the scope of the information architecture field. Don't Make Me Think is a wonderful primer for anyone who is even a little bit curious about information architecture or just wants to make their websites easier to use for all people. More usability, more money.....
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Amazing CD. The heaviest CD Evanescence has ever done. A wonderfully brutal hard rock album that keep your attention from the start and never lets go. Made of Stone, The Change, The Other Side, the list of great rock tunes goes on and on. At this point you are totally rocking out then Lost In Paradise starts up, what a gorgeous song; one of those tunes that makes you stop dead in your tracks and listen. The band has never been better, the guitars are pure rock gold, and the drumming is stellar. Then of course there is Amy's voice. WOW. Get this CD!
0385738773|4.0|james dashner completes the trilogy that we've been waiting for. While I really like the creativity of this series, the book left me wanting a tiny bit at the end (similar to mockingjay). I definitely recommend this book to anyone - very enjoyable and fast read (read it in one day).
B0058VW36U|2.0|This game isn't a lot of fun. I played it when I downloaded it and haven't wanted to play it again.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|A week ago I went to the movie theater to watch this movie in 3D. Yesterday, I received my 3D blu-ray and watched in my Mitsubishi 73\\" TV (WD-73740). And, I just love it.! The picture was just amazing! I think I liked it and appreciated better than when I went to the movie theater. This is a must buy if you have kids!
B004U52VPS|5.0|We bought this for our 6 year old son. He was addicted to the iPad version of Angry Birds. He has not stopped playing with the toy since it arrived. It requires creative construction as opposed to being a zombie in front of iPad. The whole family is now immersed in play time :). Good work Mattel and Rovio.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|One of my favorite movies with Sandra Bullock! Great customer service and received order very quickly. Thank you very much.
B00005A1PR|5.0|We enjoyed the music on this cd so well that we ordered another one for our friends.  They love it too.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was very good don't get me wrong but threr was someting missng. The ending was ok, but to wait a year for a book that you already jnow what the main idea is going to be is kind of annoying. The actual story was very good, with the introducing of a whole new camp. I just feel the book missed the \\"SO WHAT\\" fatcor that all of Riordan's previous books had. If the book had a little more \\"umph\\" it would have been my favorite book of all time. But, when i put the book down i kind of felt that there was something missing.<br /><br />P.S. I did the spelling errors and grammar mistakes on purpose becuase whoever did the editing on the book must either not read it or the company just publishes without any editing. I mean come on are you kidding me? I counted 624 errors in a 500 something page book. That is absolutely rediculous
B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter is an amazing series and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in similar types of shows. Showtime has some of the best shows out there and this is definitely at the top of the list.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I read some of the negative reviews here before posting my own. The moment I saw the first 1 star review making fun of Amy's thighs, that review lost all credibility (really? her thighs?).   Evanescence has come a long, long way since Fallen. While the first two studio albums focused solely on Amy, her lyrics, her melodies, you can tell with one listen that the third album, Evanescence, is a band collaboration. Yes, their sound IS dark and gothic, and pure 'Evanescence', and yet at the same time, you can hear the maturation in the music. Lost In Paradise, a ballad Amy wrote for the fans while going through a 'who am I?' phase, puts 'My Immortal' to shame. The vocals on songs like My Heart is Broken and The Change show how Amy has grown as a vocalist. Never Go Back and Oceans are pure rock and you HEAR the band's effort as a whole in these tracks the way you never did with Fallen or The Open Door.  I've been a die hard Evanescence fan since 2003. I didn't think anything could top Fallen in my heart. TOD came close, but the moment I heard Evanescence (The Album), I knew Amy and Company had finally achieved the near impossible. I finally feel like they have found themselves and THIS is the line up, and the music, Evanescence were destined to achieve. They've maintained their sound, and yet at the same time, avoid sounding repetitive the way so many bands these days do.
0891419063|5.0|this was a no bull story of real marines not john wayne type , once again your fellow marines were importnant not god ,flag or apple pie
0439023521|5.0|This is such a great book. When you begin to read it, you feel sorry for the characters and their story.  But the more you read it, you become entranced and feel as though that the plot is a normal occurance.  It's very visual and captivating.  While I didn't want to put it down, I wanted to savor some of the chapters as a treat to read it later.  The final chapters had me trembling.  Good book!
B001BW02B8|5.0|The down load process what different but I was able to figure it out!  Love this cd for this is my second time purchasing it.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I also didn't know what to expect from this album, other than the fact that it was created by one of the very best musicians in the world today.  I'll admit that I listened to a few songs on YouTube, before making the purchase; however, when I listened to the actual album, in full, I was deeply engrossed.  I can't stop spinning this album, nearly once every day or two!  If you like Porcupine Tree, I can't imagine why you wouldn't like this album!  Also: it is being sold at such a bargain price, especially for an album from the Kscope label (they are usually imports, which can cost $14-15+) -- let alone a double album!
B000683VI4|5.0|it came befor I was told it would. It also plays very good. i will buy from you again and will soon. Thanks alot
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The entire trilogy is amazing. Easily one of the best teen fictions I've ever read! I was hooked after the first chapter.
0307593525|5.0|The product arrived brand new and in a timely manner as described. My boyfriend loved it. There are tons of nice recipes that look amazing, i can't wait to make them with him ^.^
B004OFWLO0|5.0|This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review, but this release is so \\"off the charts\\" good that I had to follow through. I own this music on lp, cassette, and cd, but I never really heard Robert Johnson until this remastering job. The immediacy and subtlety of these performances are a revelation. I was blown away. If you don't own this music, buy it. If you own any of the prior releases and are wondering whether or not to buy another, do it! You will not be sorry.
1600597963|5.0|I own several very wonderful books on the topic of bead embroidery...but I have to admit, there's a new favorite on my bookshelf now! As I first flipped quickly through the pages I found my jaw dropping at the shear volume and quality of photographic examples. There's nothing more inspiring than looking at the work of others, and this book provides significantly more of that stimulation than your average book.<br /><br />On my second, and far slower pass, I was drawn in by the finely detailed instructions on a huge variety of bead embroidery options. Not just photos, but a bazillion or so illustrations show exactly how to create the effects Jamie Cloud Eakin explains - many of which I've never seen before. I also especially liked the step-by-step demonstrations of the order and process to bead the projects. Very helpful for those who get paralyzed by not knowing where to start or how to progress.<br /><br />Personally, I can't wait to go grab my stash of beads and get to work on some bead embroidery myself. Thank you, Jamie, for lighting my bead embroidery fire again!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|i cant wait to see the movie for this novel. this one made me cry. as i read it i thought about parts from his other books as well. while the ending is predictable i would still read it again and recommend anything written by nicholas sparks. a tale of two kids that fall in love but seperate only to reunite later in life to find each other still in love.
0446547654|5.0|I don't even know how to describe this book.  It is the first book in a long time to make me cry.  If we all could experience this kind of love, what awesome lives we would have.  Please read this book. I promise you won't be disappointed.
1595141979|5.0|Before I really start my review; I have to say something. I finally figured out why it is that I hadn't read these books until recently! I judge my books by their cover. If I don't like that cover? I probably won't read it, not unless it is highly recommended by someone. And these covers? I do NOT like.  They in now way do this story justice.<br />**WARNING** May Contain Spoilers for Previous books, NOT within spoiler codes!<br /><br />Now as for the actual book? This was my favorite in the series so far! Although I'm not sure where tos tart because there really was so much I loved about this book!<br /><br />So far we've seen Rose and Lissa as pretty much inseperable, but for a school assignment Rose gets stuck with Christian - which I love! I love that she gets to know him better (so we do too!) and that she (we) grow(s) to really like him.<br /><br />I also liked the interaction with Rose and Dimitri this book - every scene between them made me love them a little bit more. It was GREAT!<br /><br />Another thing I loved was Rose seeing the Ghost of Mason. I LOVED this! I loved the whole storyline revolving around Rose and the ghost of Mason.<br /><br />And of course? Without a spoiler? The ending! Well, I cannot wait to pick up Blood Promise!!
0393330435|5.0|I like reading biographies and was really excited when I stumbled onto this one.  Some of this is a walk down memory lane for techies.  The better parts are learning what it was like for Steve growing up, what motivated him, and what he's like as a person.  I learned a lot that I didn't know and ended up with a better understanding of the man and a greater liking of him and who he is.  Couple surprises, one being how fast they loose control of the company and get pushed out.  Second, he invented the universal remote.  Third, that at the end of the book he offers advice to tech folks for the last three pages which I thought was very cool of him.  Some authors thank people, or make a point, or make some self justification at the end of their books but Steve did something different in that he wants to see others succeed and invent and try to push what's possible and have some fun at it.  That speaks volumes about who he is at heart in that he wants to advise and help others learn and succeed.  Very cool.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Greatest series ever made, too bad it was on Fox. How can you make a great show better, release on Blu-Ray with more features and better quality.
B005BOUY38|5.0|James has an amazing voice; it's perfectly raspy and full of soul. The lyrics are thought provoking and the music is extremely well produced. I love every song and am having a hard time deciding which are my favorites, if I were pressed to name my top 7, they'd be:  Six Weeks, Forever, Person I Should Have Been, Slave to the Music, One Life, Say Something Now and Beautiful Life. But I really do love them all, I rarely skip songs, I just let the CD play from beginning to end. I really enjoyed his first 2 CD's but I think this one is even better because of it's reflectiveness of life, love and death. I think it's great that someone so young writes and sings about such meaningful things. Finally, I appreciate that the lyrics are incldued in the cover jacket, a lot of CDs don't for some reason. Buy this CD!!!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Sting singing ballads. Tenderly and deeply. It is really good for an actual winter night, when your sitting near a fireplace.
0440245931|4.0|Grisham's style is plain and that's not a bad thing. It means we can focus on the plot, and he's similarly excellent when it comes to pacing. However, his use of stock characters and clichés begins to grate on you (is it really necessary to go on about Darby Shaw's hot bod beneath her baggy clothing?). There are also times you want a bit more richness in his writing.  That said, The Pelican Brief is an easy and engrossing read perfect for a warm summer's day and a sweet piña colada. 4/5.
1594201927|5.0|Finances are part of our everyday life. The book outlines the histrory of development of modern financial institutions, starting from credit, how and why first bonds and then bond market appeared, the first central bank, the first corporation and stock, stock exchange, insurance, welfare. It is really essential in understanding modern day situations.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Do not buy this unless you have completely nonporous wood or laminate floors. It's motor is not well equipped to handle anything but cheerios on laminate. I definitely do not recommend this ever!

0553801473|1.0|Martin took what started as an incredibly engaging saga with three dimensional characters and through the course of five books, reduced it to a pile of corpses and inane heraldry. In this book, characters who we spend thousands of pages to get to know are reduced to corpses or flat desultory characters. The language is limited and words like 'flay' appear everywhere without a seeming literary purpose. I became more and more frustrated as a read the last two books in this series and think the magic is over. I'm moving on to the next read and not looking back.

But since I read the Mastering the Nikon D7000 of Darrel Young, the camera manual resides at home. This books is the best companion on my trips, it cover in a more easy way the different subjects.<br /><br />Easy to read.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|The best television dramas of all time don't TELL you what is good or bad, or WHO is good or bad - they let people be people, and then you form your own opinions of the characters.  From the Sopranos, to the Wire, to the Shield, and now Breaking Bad.  And honestly, I think this may surpass them all, even the Sopranos.<br /><br />Meet Walter White. Well, if you're already on Season 4, I assume you know his story.  From dorky chemistry teacher/car wash worker to million-dollar methamphetamine cook, the transformation is unbelievable, yet believable at the same time.  You know his story, how he got here, and it all seems to fit.  The writers have made it clear for a long time that Breaking Bad was similar to Scarface - that Walt is comparable to the transformation of Mr. Chips to Scarface, and this season shows that perfectly.<br /><br />Walt has and still believes coming into season 4 that he is doing this all for his family.  But is he?  How far will he go?  And is this all for money, or something else?  We get to see many ethical dilemmas and inner moral battles in most of the characters this season - Walt, Skyler, Jesse, Mike, Hank, Marie and even maybe a small glimpse into the past of chicken man and meth king-pin - Gustavo Fring.<br /><br />Each episode gets more and more dark (did you think it was possible?), and Walt continues to surprise the audience with strange decisions and a terrifying look into the path he is going down.  If you look back at season 1 episode 1, before the meth and cancer, that angry, tortured individual was already inside of him.  That results in the question: was Walt ever even really that good of a guy?  He hasn't changed as much as you may think, but his anguish, pain, and stress is amplified by about 200x.  And as expected, the end of each episode is usually a major cliff-hanger, and you'll be begging for more.<br /><br />The acting is nothing but simply perfect.  Bryan Cranston as Walt will make you laugh, cry, or even get angry with him.  Giancarlo Esposito as Gus becomes a huge player this season, and he should be up for an Emmy.  The glazed, empty, evil look in his eyes is terrifying, and there aren't many boundaries he won't cross to get what he wants.<br /><br />This is definitely the darkest, thought-provoking, best acted show on television at the moment, and maybe ever.  If you haven't watched it, start from the beginning and follow Walt's odd and morally perplexing adventure into the life of a meth cook.him.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|Awesome. Just awesome. If you - like yours truly - thought that the amazing series \\"Spartacus\\" was dead after its mesmerizing predecessor, \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand,\\" think again. I am happy to say that \\"Spartacus - Gods of the Arena\\" triumphs in every way -- it is as good as it gets.  The second installment of this fantastic and gruesome series takes us to the world of Spartacus before his arrival to the house of Batiatus. In the first episode, \\"Past Transgressions,\\" we are briefly taken back to the future that we know, which we saw in the conclusion of \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand.\\" We also witness how the House of Batiatus slowly, but surely, takes form. We also meet Batiatus and his wife Lucretia (the magnificent John Hannah, and Lucy Lawless, respectively), as well as Oenomaus (the astonishing Peter Mensah), before he became the feared gladiator trainer or Doctore, who at the time was married Melitta (Marisa Ramirez). And then there is Gannicus (Dustin Clare), who was the reigning champion of the House of Batiatus, and the envy of his rivals in the trade. In addition, we see how Batiatus learns the gladiator business the hard way, and how he becomes the cold-blooded gladiator owner and person that he is. In the remaining five episodes, we meet more interesting characters, such as Titus (Jeffrey Thomas), Batiatus' father, who, to his son's displeasure, wants to re-take control of his gladiators. We are also introduced to the beautiful Gaia (Jaime Murray), Lucretia's close and calculating friend. Finally, we meet some of the regulars from the previous season: Crixus (Manu Bennett), the mesmerizing future champion; Solonius (Craig Walsh Wrightson), Batiatus' best friend and future foe; and Crixus's girlfriend, Naevia (Lesley-Ann Brandt). In the end, of course, the set is ready for Spartacus - Blood and Sand,\\" as Batiatus consolidates his power, despite his father telling him, \\"You really did not want this life, did you?\\" and his worst enemy predicting, \\"There will be an accounting, Batiatus, for this and everything that follows.\\"  \\"Spartacus - Gods of the Arena\\" has all the elements that made the first season successful. It has grandiose cinematography, great production design, plenty of sex and nudity, lots of cursing, intrigue, and, best of all, a great story. While I'm writing this, it has been announced that Andy Whitfield, who played Spartacus in \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand,\\" sadly died at the early age of 39. He's a hard act to follow, for sure, and lets hope that Liam McIntyre, his replacement, continue the series success with \\"Spartacus - Vengeance.\\" The DVD includes a glimpse at the Starz Studios' set of Gods of the Arena, an anatomy of a scene, a segment on the production design of the show, arena bloopers, an interview with Lucy Lawless, and much more.

0307387178|4.0|I read this book after watching the movie. Thank goodness Jon Krakauer is a good writer, but I didn't like his mid-book insertion of his own experience climbing in Alaska. I can understand how it might provide relief from the sad drama of McCandless's life, but I thought Krakauer kind of wanted to show off his prowess somewhere and this book was that place. Incidentally that part has the most swears than in other parts of the book.  The thing that gets me is how ultimately familiar McCandless is. I don't mean that I was so bull-headed and focused and intense ever in my life, and I don't know many people that would forgo the comforts of civilization just to prove something to themselves, but I did know a handful of people in high school and early college (just that age I guess) who were very adamant about their beliefs and had troubled relations with their fathers or other authority figures, but were still good kids. One girl: \\"I don't believe in owning a TV.\\" One guy: \\"I'm going to get a bunch of supplies together and go save the Chechens from Russia.\\" (At one point McCandless said this about South Africa and Apartheid.) And what about all those people for no reason whatsoever want to go camping or drive cross-country alone, just to accept the challenge? So yeah, I knew a few people like McCandless, bright, talented, yet with a bit of gaps in their logic and a way of thinking themselves somehow apart or better than the common run. And I know even more people who have parts of his drive embedded in small pieces in their own psyches, if it isn't all of us. How many of us say we want to do something crazy and write a book about it? That's even the premise behind Julie & Julia and other things that aren't so off-the-map. I think a bit of this nature is in all of us--to do something difficult, to improve ourselves, to get away from humans for a while, and then return to them with stories of our enriching experiences. The only difference is, McCandless didn't live to tellabout it, and his death was harrowing.  I guess that's why, knowing how tragically the book would end, I didn't put the book down, no matter how haunting it got. It felt like I was meeting those old personalities that I used to know.  But the thing that alienates me is that I don't feel like reading the books he read. I hope with time this feeling fades, because the Russians really rock.  I'd say don't buy this book but borrow it from someone. I don't think you'll want to read it more than once.  My condolences to his family. I agree that children can be cruel to their parents for no reason.
0691152640|5.0|If you are looking for a Michael Lewis type storytelling book which tends to be informative, educational, and entertaining, this book is not that type of book.  The value of this book arrives from the painstaking accumulation and organization of data that most likely took years to gather and analyze.  The vast majority of the book is data, charts, graphs, and tables.  To put things in perspective, the book is 463 pages in length (paperback version) and the final 170 pages alone (36.7%)are dedicated to data appendixes and references.  That's on top of the heavy data included in the first 293 pages.  It will take the reader some effort to dig out the nuggets of wisdom supported by the vast (and valuable) data.  Some of the takeaways are intuitive and expected (banking crises in advanced economies significantly drag down world growth) but the ability to follow along with the data and time series allows one to connect the dots and follow the bouncing ball enabling the reader to build their own understanding of the issues to create a mental model of sovereign debt and negative ramifications if mismanaged (which occurs far more often than we tend to realize).  The book touches on very important macro and systematic issues that all come together in little bits and pieces (with reader effort); banking reserve requirements, market confidence, fiscal policy, taxation, contagion on world public and private sectors, exports, output, trade, equity prices, etc.  The good news is that we should be thankful that the authors (or their poor interns) assembled and quantified such vast and historical data on sovereign debt defaults and the quantitative ramifications of such defaults.  I always feel I owe gratitude towards the authors and those that sacrifice years of their lives crafting such work when I can receive all of the benefits for under $20 dollars.  The bad news is that this is difficult and required reading that must be done diligently and with a clear mind if you really want to understand sovereign debt.  I highly recommend a notebook and a willingness to mine for the nuggets that will help you make sense of the issues.  Again, this is not a storybook or a novel, nor is it a textbook.  Textbooks often include vast data, but tend to be very specific in talking points/teaching points enabling the student to learn and grasp the topic efficiently.  If there is one thing that would be valuable or make the book a bit more appealing, it would be to include a chapter summary with teaching points, talking points or anything that assists the reader (hopefully global leaders/municipal leaders/politicians) cause and effect in sovereign debt, fiscal and monetary policy.  This would also be of value to traders, investment advisors or individual investors as well as they would benefit from the core wisdom of the data in a more efficient delivery.  The fact that this written work became a NY Times Bestseller is both a surprise and encouraging.  Hopefully people actually start paying attention to the real message that the data supports.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I have been a \\"Scotty\\" fan since I first saw him audition for the judges singing Your Man on AI.  I have listened to this CD (in my vehicle) 4 times since I received it and I love all of the songs especially \\"Dirty Dishes\\", \\"Water Tower Town\\", and \\"That Old King James\\".  Would not surprise me one bit if most of these songs hit the charts.  This young man can really sing, no doubt about it, doesn't matter if its a slow, fast, or in-between song.  You might as well just buy this CD and have the best country songs around by the best country singer of today.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Like all the other current reviewers, I saw the live broadcast at my local theater, and I was so impressed by the acting and moved by the music.  Compared to every other version I have heard or seen, this was by far the best. The actors have this expressiveness that make their roles so believable. Their singing was near perfect (it was a live performance, so not entirely perfect)  I had only one complaint to the performance, and it was the chandelier. I had looked forward to that heart-stopping moment when the chandelier swings down, but it only sparks. I understand that it may have been because of the theater's limitations, or for the safety of the audience, but that iconic moment changed stung a little.  Otherwise, I recommend this version to every fan of the phantom and will definitely be pre-ordering the DVD myself.

0691142165|5.0|If you are a private investor trying to choose your own Business to invest in, you must read this book. The section on Forgotten History of Domestic Debt and Default is exceptional. I also like Chapter 10 on the Banking Crises. The best chapters for me were 14 The Aftermath of Financial Chrises and 17 Reflections on Early Warnings. This book is well writen and easy to read. It has a down to earth factual explanation of financial history, cause and effect, so that any person can avoid many of the traps in todays investing.

1423140591|2.0|left flat. Like other reviews, I felt like the book was a letdown, and most importantly, the worst of his books I've read. After reading the whole thing the day it showed up(I was really looking forward to it) I came to a few conclusions. (There will be spoilers, or skip to the bottom for a TL;DR)<br /><br />First, the book, which is meant to bridge the Percy's story and Jason's story together, has an exposition problem in a couple ways. While mostly ignoring the fact that Percy has been gone for eight months, the book tries to provide all the exposition for Camp Jupiter that previous readers have had for camp half-blood into a couple chapters. This it does haphazardly. It tries to recreate some of the classic motifs of camp-half blood (with mostly minor difference and the major ones usually only getting a line or two) while also introducing new characters (who as another reader pointed out are not nearly as exciting Piper or Leo.) Frank and Hazels' backstory is confusing and muddled (Frank's more so), but the main problem is that neither is given time to mature. Full development has been reached prior to the final quest, which isn't too different, but it feels like more of an afterthought.<br /><br />Next, the plot is very similar to the other books in terms of how it plays out, but lacks that usual brilliance in execution. The situation seem blaze, then are suddenly given a life or death ultimatum which eventually turns out not to be true.<br /><br />Thirdly, there is no feeling of accomplishment at the end of the novel. The reader is left feeling like they just read a 500 some odd page advertisement for the next book. The final battle is too easy. The quest's ending is too easy. The resolution of most of the plot points is too easy, and (as someone else already said) Frank kills a giant (in elephant form for dramatic effect) without the aid of a god.<br /><br />Finally, (the thing that bugged me most) this novel contradicts itself in how it deals with death. The first novel and most of this novel are dealing with why restoring death to power would be a good thing, and then everyone we care about comes back to life (because Hades gives them a free pass.) Despite this seeming entirely out of character,(and he is not the only god to do so) it flies in the face of everything the book has been arguing for. Not to mention, all three characters get boring to read which is especially surprising for Percy because I was so used to his point of view being entertaining.<br /><br />Finally (really this time), The Romans(who are supposed to be the sworn enemies of Greeks and masters of discipline and order) come off as one, disinterested, and two lame. What sets them apart from the Greeks is never really explained, and this led me to feel like they would be able to patch up all their relations in a chapter or two. Something the gods could probably have started during the titan wars. What I really wanted this book to be was Percy learning to survive in the Roman camp where discipline and outright dislike would have made his life challenging instead of given to him on a silver platter.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />The thing that made the first one so interesting to me is that it took the gods who were displayed as enemies in the first series were given a chance to shine in their own respects. This one attempts to continue this trend, but fails miserably. This book is like a dinner that was started too late so everything, appetizer, main course, and dessert were thrown into one bowl, shoved into the oven, and cooked halfway. I think it tries to accomplish too much, and ended failing in most respects. It was a disappointment, but I still read it, will probably read it again, and will continue reading the series.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|i'm going to start this review off by saying that i was never really a HUGE anthrax fan. i had always found their albums to be either very inconsistent or sometimes TOO consistent. albums like 'state of euphoria' had one or two good songs on it but was very choppy and random, while albums like 'persistence of time' sounded like it was the exact same song over and over again. so anthrax never really held a special place in my metal heart. even the bush era albums didn't do much for me, though, 'sound of white noise', was a solid album.  fast forward to 2011 and we have the release of 'worship music' which is, in my opinion, the best all around THRAX record ever. this is an album that you can listen to from beginning to end without wanting to skip tracks or get bored with it. each song works well on it's own and as a part of the whole to create a vibe as you're listening. even the 'hymns' tracks add something to the overall listening experience by not only breaking up the album a bit but also creating a mood that lives up to the whole \\"worship\\" theme of the album.  the music on this album is incredible. not only does it live up to that classic anthrax sound with tracks like 'the devil you know' and 'fight'em til you cant', but it also goes into more melodic metal territory with songs like 'in the end' and 'i'm alive'. and it's very easy to see john bush singing on some of these songs, thinking maybe a few of them were written while he was still in the band. 'i'm alive' is definately one of those songs. gone is the constant CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA guitar lines and TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP drumming that plagued some older anthrax releases. the only track on this that leaves me somewhat disappointed is 'judas priest'. though everyone on earth seems to be praising this song, i'm just not feeling it. the song is supposedly NOT about the band JP but is it's own entity, which is hard to believe since there are several JP song titles thrown in for \\"color\\". and it's hard to believe that the song is not about JP because, in reality, what IS a judas priest? it doesn't exist. i dont know......something tells me they didn't get their story straight while writing this one.  returning to the fold after a 20 year absence is vocalist joey belladonna. his welcome return adds much to the album as he is in top form here. his voice having matured over the years brings more depth and emotion to the songs than on previous albums. he sounds simply fantastic.  with belladonna back in the fold and the music kicking ass, it's easy to see this as one of the best metal releases of 2011. i hope they keep this lineup of anthrax together for a very long time. i would love to see what they put out after this album.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|i bought this drivel based on the good reviews. The book is poor writing, really bad, and probably written by a ghost writer.   I notice that many of the 5 star reviews are glowing, hyped-up language, disconnected from any reality. Many of these fan reviewers have only a few reviews, or all of their reviews are 5 star with the same glowing hyperbole.  its possible the publisher is salting these reviews.  The book: dreadful. dreadful writing, dreadful plot, dreadful characters. I liked lee child's early stuff, but I got conned on this one.  Even the violence is fake, as Reachers opponents are retarded or drunk. I suspect the ghost-writer is in England, as his cardboard-cutout characterizations of American citizens reveals his lack of familiarity.   A few factual mistakes he made: You can't have guns in England, so writer assumes you have to buy an M16 on the black market here. In fact, assault rifles like the mini-14 are sold over the counter.  in the woods, he says stepping on any stick bigger than a broom handle makes a big noise. smaller sticks do too.  this was pure garbage, and Instead of a decent read, I got a low quality piece of writing that did not draw me in.   To repeat, I suspect paid flacks of the publisher are salting these reviews. Either that, or we have an army of mouth-readers who would like something like this.
B005FFW46S|4.0|An enjoyable Pratchett read. That's the 4 stars.  Not an enjoyable Kindle read. That would be 1.   I concur with the other observations of really poor proofing. The e-reader versions of most Pratchett novels seem to have all been set up and proofed by Young Sam. No more than a few paragraphs between lostspaces, including any and all words preceding the wordpeople, no footnotes (plenty of * referring to them though), and words with reveresd-missig-iadded letters. Overall a painful read on my Kindle 3.  I've come to expect this with some $0.99 and converted downloads, but not in a new release from Harper, especially at virtually hardcover cost.  If I were to choose again, I'd go with print.  UPDATE: Enough negatives and Harper re-edited. The corrected version is a much more enjoyable read. For future releases I will probably wait a few weeks, as painful as that might be, to let the editing be completed.

I don't mind long rambling novels, but when the author has to pull major characters out of nowhere at the last minute in order to answer unanswered questions, that is when I loose interest. The book is long, with repetitive scenes and a thrown together ending. Not worth the time even at a reduced price.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Shipping was great, only to be disappointed by the actual product. It didn't work when it wasn't plugged in, and when I did use it while it was charging, I couldn't hear much of a difference if any. In fact, the music sounded better when this amp wasn't used, and ran straight off of my I-Pod Classic.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|We enjoyed this movie at the theater and wanted it for our home library, digital and otherwise. Movie is funny and fresh, kids and adults can enjoy it at the same time.
1594744769|4.0|shadows.<br />I really liked this book. It was one of the few books I actually stay up till the sun rises reading. I have never read a book like this. The pictures, Oh my Goodness, the pictures! they made this book that much more interesting. A truly unique read. Riggs did an amazing job incorporating those old photographs into his novel. Some where so disturbing that they gave me goose bumps. Keep in mind of course, I read this book late at night and I happened to be the only one awake. What I loved about this book was just how much I related to the main character Jacob. The stuff that he would say,think and do was hilarious. I don't get to read very many novels where the narrator is male but the few I have where extremely well written. This being one of them. Another thing I loved about this book is the character development of the grandfather. You start out thinking of the grandfather as a delusional old man suffering from paranoia and dementia. Then as the story unfolds he becomes a very kind and caring man who thought of others before himself. The more I found out about his grandfather the more I wish this story was real because I would have liked to meet him. The only problem I had with the story was Jacob ****spoiler alert**** and Emma. I mean I liked Emma as a character but the relationship between the two left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't get over the fact ***spoiler alert*** that Emma used to date his grandfather. In the book you see him telling himself the same thing before he chooses to forget it. she isn't even over his grandfather yet. I found myself wanting to slap him and tell him to find another girl. Aside from that I LOVED this book. I will be reading it again and again. I would definitely recommend it to others. In fact I have my husband reading it now =)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I first read this book in a preview and fell in love with it. This novel is by far THE best one I have have ever read. I couldn't savor it had to devour in less than two days but it was so witty and sappy! This novel is so twisted and keeps you on your toes, it's messy, funny, sappy (in a wonderful way). It's the entire book that keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and the detail to this story was like a movie in my brain! This novel shows all the sides of love, and not just the happy side, but the fights and heartbreak that is all wrapped into love.   Buy it. It won't be a waste of your time nor your money when you want to read it again and again, just to fall in love with them all over again.     I laughed, cried a little and felt their pain in this story. I give my props to Jamie McGuire, you are one of the best authors I've ever read and I will waiting to devour more of your stories!
0545123275|3.0|I read this book a long time ago when it first came out. I was going through a werewolf phase when I bought this. Actually I think YA was going through a werewolf/vamp phase thanks to Twilight. (I wasn't a big fan of the twilight sagas..whenever I read them I have this unbearable urge to upchuck). The main character Grace was attacked by a wolf pack, and was saved by a wolf with yellow eyes. Ever since then she looks for her savior wolf each winter. Years later a boy appears in her yard- he is injured and he has those yellow eyes. she realizes that the boy is her savior wolf. They fall in love. Anyways my brain is kind of foggy on the details. I only remember this much because I skimmed through the book before I wrote this. I guess that's not a good thing because some books that I've read YEARS ago I couldn't forget even if I wanted too. Shiver's plot had no real excitement. The only tension between them is the impeding winter where he changes back into a wolf. Their love is the whole novel and the fact he is a werewolf is the main attraction. Now I know I sound a bit negative but I'm not completely dumping this book. I remember I did like it. Yes, it was cheesy. Yes it was uneventful. Yes, it was slow and I didn't feel close to the characters. BUT I am a woman and I do love me a unrealistic romance every now and then. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I like the new twist on werewolves. Its creative what authors are coming up with now: Meyer with instant shifts, Blood and Chocolate with moon shifts, and now Shiver with winter shifts. I do feel the author should have just left it as a single novel. I refused to read the sequels because I have a heard the author left a lot of loop holes. I would recommended this book to paranormal fans who prefer a slower read focused on simmering love than readers who enjoy action and drama with just a dollop of romance (like me)
6305212112|1.0|This is one of those movies that are too long. It is very dull and I kept wishing it was over. it is just an old lady telling a story of her life. You can get that by voulentearing at a nurseing home, but as a voulentear you will actually help someone who is lonley.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|I busted out in smiles when I listened to this latest set of songs from Johnny, I couldn't stop movin' & groovin'.  This guy has been laying down tracks for over 50 years from \\"School Day Blues\\" to the last track recorded for this set, what a great body of work he has put together, this is just another feather in his cap.  Johnny Winter still moves, folks.  \\"Roots\\" proves it, nobody gets more energy out of a guitar, and with an assembly of peers, friends, & other brothers from the road, they lay down some familiar tracks with some new grooves. Johnny is in great voice & everybody seems to be on the same page.  I can't get over how great this sounds.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|works amazingly better then google, yahoo, ping, wikipedia or any other search engine, period. Only thing missing is a search widget! that would make it perfect. im still very very pleased i bought this.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I loved fringe season 1 and 2, and at first I thought I might not like this one with the other Olivia switching in and out, but I really did enjoy the whole season, it was very well made, and if you liked season's one and two you will like this one as well.  The LSD episode near the end of the season is AMAZING!!
0670022411|3.0|I enjoyed this first novel by D Harkness.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about supernatural characters in a fictional world then you will enjoy this book. The characters are interesting and well developed.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the comments that there were slows spots and too much description of eating and drinking.  Whoever her editor was should have had those removed or revised.  But there is plenty of other description to offset this (talking about the various kinds of creatures in the world, the alchemical background, the vampire family, etc.)<br /><br />The good stuff in the more than makes up for the slow stuff.<br /><br />At the same time, the story is interesting and inventive.  Sure we have lots of books on witches and vampires but this is a different take.<br /><br />When I read the book I was transported to the fictional world and found it interesting.<br />The ending was a little jarring but I knew from the beginning it would be multiple volumes.
B0052GACNM|2.0|Listened to it 2 times and just did not care for some of the songs and the way he did them and who he did them with, so I wound up giving it to my girlfriend and her husband.  Some songs just go with certain people.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Bought this for my daughter, it was one of her favorite movies as a child. We got the movie in record time and didn't pay extra
B003ZSJ212|4.0|nice set a bit upset it is not original IV thruVI i saw at movies thats what i wanted not all added stuff
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|I purchased this from the kindle store as a fun read-aloud with the family. I hate to give up on any book, so we slogged through to the end. Even though it is a short book, that felt like real work. How dull. How derivative. Tolkien plus X-men plus sci-fi television. It felt like it was being written as a hopeful screen play for a crap movie. And the end felt like a hopeful pitch for a sequel. I can't imagine who would want a sequel. The ending was so very dull that I didn't even realize it was over. My husband was reading aloud and I actually asked \\"Is that it?\\"  Full of awkward metaphors and similes, like \\"Shelley's face turned the color of a ripe pomegranate.\\" For a book that places a premium on the visual world (it reproduces many old photographs) the writing never seems to deliver convincing visual descriptions. The photos aren't always a good match for the story. Some things just feel unresearched, creating a false note that hangs over the entire story. The writer seems most comfortable writing about the boredom of being a wealthy teen (the beginning of the book) - perhaps a world closer to home, and a better subject for his efforts.   Can't believe this is a best seller. So many other books out there that have at least some story, or characterization, or beautiful use of language, or SOMETHING to offer.

B0053TMP24|5.0|After reading the Son Of Neptune, I had to read it again!! It picks up where The Lost Hero left off, in Percy's perspective. He wakes up six months after he and Jason were switched. He makes it alive, and without memory (except Annnabeth's name), to Camp Jupiter. Quickly making friends with two demigods named Frank and Hazel who have been good friends during the duration of their stay, the three get sent on a quest by Mars to Alaska, where they need to find Thantos and free him. Along the way, they figure out where Hazel came from, who Frank's godly parent is, and a way for Percy to regain his memory. At the end of the book, we were left hanging with Percy, Frank, and Hazel about to meet and remeet demigods Annabeth, Jason, Piper, and Leo. Please finish The Mark of Athena quickly Rick!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My kids and I have watched Episodes IV, V, VI, I and part of II...and they are all excellent!  The picture and sound quality is superb.  We also enjoyed watching the deleted scenes, particularly the previously unreleased ones.  If you are a Star Wars fan, this is a must have!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you  create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Hilarious is the only word that describes this movie. Ten times better then Hangover. Great movie to watch over and over again.
B0055SWM08|2.0|Let me start with, this game is beautiful, and I really enjoy playing it.  However...  It has crashed over a dozen times, more than any other app on my phone. A lot more. Sometimes it comes back without a problem, sometimes it takes a few loads.  Four times now it has deleted everything I have done. This does not have any correlation to the crashes, sometimes it is just when I exit and return.    And if I turn my phone for landscape mode the screen turns yellow. I'm ok without the possibility of landscape, a lot of games are not multidirectional.  I just hate how the screen flakes out.   If it weren't for the bugs I would give it a 5 star rating, but I'm finding the game too frustrating to keep trying.    And yes, I have tried uninstalling and starting over. Those times are not included in my totals of lost games and crashes. Played on an HTC EVO 4G.
0385738773|5.0|HOLY SHUCK!!!  This book is awesome!!  I got the book yesterday but thanks to darn things like work getting in the way I just finished it a day later. I could not put it down,  400 pages of suspense. Did Thomas get out of the white walls?, did they find the other Gladers? did Teresa  stab him in the back AGAIN? is WICKED good?  all while they have to fight with a city of Cranks with electric grenades, guns and hand to hand combat with the help of some old friends and new friends. Also having to fight with flare  which leads to the Oh My God part of the book that made me to cry and throw the book across the room all at the same time but the story wasn't over. WICKED was still after them and Thomas had to decide if he was going to give in or to keep on fighting.
1441407820|5.0|It is no surprise to me that this book has been as popular as it is for as long as it has.  As different as one may be from the main character Siddhartha, the questions, feelings and situations that are tackled in this book are timeless and span across cultures. It is not a long book and can probably be read in a single day, but it is definitely worth it.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I felt I would love his music just by hearing what he has played on his t.v. show, and I was RIGHT!  He is an excellent, multi-talented performer and I have enjoyed every aspect of his career!
1439153663|5.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" is a wonderful book, beautifully written, full of interesting characters and a heartbreaking story.  The author mixes enough joy, laughter, tenderness and hope into the story to keep it from being overwhelming.  It is a story about an indentured servant living with the slaves and the primary characters are so real you could almost see them.  It was a tragic time in our history.  Even white women of substance were not that much better off than the slaves if they were married to cruel men.  This book will make you laugh and cry, think and feel, and you will not soon forget it.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I need to start this review with a confession for perspective's sake. I bought this album on the recommendations I read online of Mayer Hawthorne's strong melodies. Ordinarily, I would not have given an album in the soul/ R'nB genre much of a chance, but for some reason, this time I decided to go for it!<br /><br />I am very happy I did, because what I discovered in Hawthorne's music is a great sense of melody, high quality production and some seriously catchy tunes. (I totally dig the feel of songs such as \\"A Long Time\\" and \\"Hooked\\") While he does not have the greatest voice ever, his style of singing is infectious enough to overlook that fact.<br /><br />If I had to choose one word to describe the album it would be \\"groove\\". This album grooves from start to finish, from the low, grinding, greasy feel of \\"Can't Stop\\" through to the carefree pop/ soul of \\"Finally Falling\\". Hawthorne certainly has the ability to compose a great song, and I seriously doubt that talent like his will remain under the radar for much longer!<br /><br />\\"How Do You Do\\" has taught me to not write off an album simply because it is part of a particular genre without first giving it a chance. I am now keen to check out Hawthorne's earlier releases, and I look forward to seeing where this very infectious album is going to take him.
B005NPD2I4|5.0|Best album yet! Wicked ways and Coming Down are my favorites, hope they're singles. But they're all great! So Good!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a geek, a mother of 2 Gen-xers, and Trivia buff, Ready Player One was a rollicking good read. For me, it was as good as Hunger Games but with more fun factor. And gosh, I remember far too many of those games, systems, and 80's entertainment references than is probably healthy for one person. Nice tight little plot, believable geeks and online culture, requisite Big Bad...even 'The DeLorean' for good measure. I'm going to have to go back and re-read it slower this time to catch more references.
B0000667RO|5.0|The Cd was in great shape, played perfectly, arrived VERY fast! I would totally purchase from you again. Thank you!
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I read an article recently that referred to the Nirvana/grunge sound as being the last major music rock music revolution. In terms of pop culture that may be true. Than again since when did pop music become shorthand for rock n roll. Band after band,artist after artist have continually looked to broaden what humans consider to be popular music. And in those terms Bjork wrote the book a long time ago. Even though her music can always be found in the pop section of the record store and/or website. But she's always been one who dares and more over DELIGHTS in being herself,even as the pop music world has become more and more closed minded since she began her adult solo career. The question is how could Bjork continue to do this anyhow? After all,she seems to have already all that she can do on that front. But in this day and age where the key to popularity seems to be heavy production values and repetitive hooks,this takes a huge about face from that.<br /><br />  Now the single off of this album is \\"Crystalline\\". But that's only by necessity because this is not an album of singles. Nor is it really about separate songs either. From the jingling prettiness of the opening \\"Moon\\" to more percussive pieces such as \\"Hollow\\" this is very much pieces of a larger whole. Using different varieties of rhythm and almost atonal melodies this album uses a horn and string choir for the purpose of creating spare sound scapes. And the subject matter is the most appealing part. With lyrics that reconcile the creation of the cosmos (in scientific terms of course) with life itself it combines with the instrumentation,melodies and rhythmic patterns to create music that is more impressionistic of the subject matter than it does to any melodic pop form. By using a stylistic palette that draws from Bjork's past approach to music it manages to fulfill much of her musical concept.<br /><br />  This is not the first time that Bjork has sought to redefine what pop music is,at least on her terms. While she's been successful,it's been somewhat at random and in different ways. And as with many people in this era,her persona is often judged based on more surface level factors (such as her image) as opposed to any music she might make. On the other hand that is one way she got more attention focused on her artistry to begin with. In reality,it all goes hand in hand with Bjork. And because the album delves into topics not normally covered in pop music anymore there are already some dismissing this album was pretentious new age music. The important thing is how,through the music and lyrics how she seeks to humanize the broad topics she's presenting here. This as with most of her music is one of those albums that will take more than one listen to truly appreciate it's impact. Overall I must say,having heard Bjork's music quite a lot over the years that is in indeed probably a key album as it represents the culmination of much of what she's been doing for the previous decade and a half. I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next time.successful,it's been somewhat at random and in different ways.

B003LZ5B7S|5.0|This episode established the mood for the Series with the transmitter hidden in sight while not instantly explaining how the Doctor understood the misunderstood life-form, known as the Consciousness.  The act of explaining the reason for the invasion being a wealth of resources that could be used is justifiable, because of destroyed planets.  A panic at the end causing plenty of destruction is a classic example of the build up to create believability at the end. A response to reveal how people with their sense of reality violated would act at the end pulls the story together for a sense of ending.<br /><br />The end where the strange man offers the young woman the option of an exciting life is hook to catch the viewer for watching the next show.  I admired how Rose's attention was captured by that Doctor evading that curious woman's questions as part of, believable building of a relationship.  An escape was desired with the Doctor knowing of Rose's future so he could justify in his mind taking her away.

B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I didn't think much when first buying this app, but I was sadly mistaken.<br /><br />I thought &quot;how good could a JRPG on Android possibly be?&quot; It was good enough to have me pull out my old NES and disconnect my 360, to play some old school JRPG'S<br /><br />The game focuses on three characters, 1 of which you are introduced to immediately but dont acquire until roughly 10 to 15 into the game. The character is a princess who's castle has been betrayed by it's own people. The game then takes you two the two main characters you start off with, one of which is a magical Golem. The two soon find the princess in trouble, save her, take her to the nearest town. There they learn about eachother, and about the main quest of the game. She decides to come with them on their journey and so they embark on an Epic Adventure that only a NES RPG theme styled game can tell.<br /><br />The story is good, if your not expecting mind blowing, but a great story for a great rpg on Android.<br /><br />The characters are not the same, and each have their own style of character, and personality which you learn about later on.<br /><br />You get to actually assign each fighting style of the characters by books that you collect in the world. (Medic, Knight, Thief) Each one has different abilities, strengths, &amp; weaknesses. Certain books can only be assigned to specific characters.<br /><br />Leveling up is based on a merit point system, and skills must be carefully chosen if you plan on making it through the game.<br /><br />As you progress through, fighting monsters you will earn gold which can buy you items, weapons, &amp; armor. You also learn new abilities this way. Spells are cast using MP, which is a bar underneath your health.<br /><br />All in all the game is great, you can change the control's from touch, to fixed keys, to movable keys, and this however is my only true problem with this great title. The control scheme is very frustrating at times, especially when trying to avoid or run away from monsters, or encounters when on low health and few items.<br /><br />Even if you change the control scheme it doesn't matter because of how your character runs around to get there, in the end no matter how frustrating it got, touch was always the obvious and fastest way to move from danger even if it wasn't the most accurate.<br /><br />However, I wasn't going to let a little control annoyance stop me from enjoying a fantastic game. This really brought me back to my childhood of playing all my favorite JRPG's on my Nintendo.<br /><br />I just wanted to say Thank you, from a 30 year old, who forgot the old days of gaming.<br />Sometimes graphics, Multiplayer, and all the fancy stuff we have today doesn't fill the magic that you used to feel when playing a game. It doesn't come from graphics, or all the next gen devices, but it brings you to a magic place where you are happy. Thats all you care about. The fact that it's putting a smile on your face.<br /><br />This is the best game I've played on Android so far. I hope the rest of you will enjoy it as much as I have. I hope this review helped. Thank you<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />OldSchoolGamer101tems.

0545123275|3.0|Since I'm a sucker for reading most books from the New York Times Bestsellers list, I decided to give this book a try. Although it definitely had its high points, and the love story was sweet and sincere, I didn't really care for the book so much. I often got distracted and felt like it was dragging on, the only thing keeping me interested was the moments that Grace and Sam, the main characters, interacted. I wasn't really interested in the whole wolf story and those moments in the beginning where the author didn't really dive into their relationship was quite boring to me and I often found my mind drifting off somewhere else, even while I was reading.<br /><br />What did strike me was the middle-end of the book, when Grace and Sam had their tender and loving moments, you could really sense the love they had for one another. It was really sad and suspenseful though, with the whole \\"when will he change into a wolf?\\" thing looming over your head the whole time they're together, but I did enjoy how it ended. Maggie Stiefvater definitely leaves you wondering if everything's okay and if they're love will indeed conquer all in the end. The humor and action was kept alive through all of Grace's and Sam's friends though so it was good that their stories were brought into play as the book went on, because it felt very boring and slow to me at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the ending though, not to say it was a happy ending, it was quite sad, but leaves you wanting more, which is why I'll be getting \\"Linger\\" once I get the chance. The author was good at making you want to know how Grace and Sam turn out and if they can overcome the wolf dilemma. I'd say it was a decent read, not a page-turner for me, but something to enjoy.
B000PMG16U|3.0|The Blu-ray rendition of the prequel trilogy isn't much to look at, to be honest. Most of the series was shot recently enough to where they were able to transfer it over to Blu-ray quality more smoothly, at least more than the original trilogy. Honestly, I might be spoiled by my PS3, which upscales the quality of my original Star Wars DVDs and after watching that, these did nothing for me at all....virtually little to no difference. So if you have an upscaling DVD player, I'd just stick to my original DVDs and make use of that, and save about $100 on the whole series.<br /><br />They changed a few things in this version, but most of it is not noticeable. Apparently, they tweak Star Wars more with every DVD release, and this one is no different...use Google or go to Wikipedia to see the full list of changes. The most glaring thing is they changed Yoda in Episode 1 from that pig-nosed puppet to the CGI version they used in Episodes 2 and 3, which just made the whole series more consistent...I didn't think it was detrimental at all, as I always wondered why Yoda has a pig nose in Episode 1 but it disappeared for the rest of the series. Every other \\"change\\" they made on the list was highly unnoticeable by me, and I've watched these films about 10+ times now.<br /><br />The biggest thing are the specials...but I think most people won't be watching those after the movie is over. If you're looking for the ultimate DVD collection for Star Wars....this isn't it. Don't  know what their plans are for the future, but I doubt this is the last Star Wars DVD release they'll put out, and I wouldn't be shocked to see a Special Edition version somewhere down the line. Either way, unless you're just dying to have these on Blu-ray discs, I think you can skip it, and see what the future holds.
0439023491|5.0|The 2nd book in The Hunger Games trilogy. After reading the first book I was eager to jump into this book and see the fate of Katniss and her love triangle with Peeta and Gale. Honestly, I was never really a big fan of Peeta. Yes he loved her from the beginning, but I never really saw that love in the romantic sense. In fact, romance was definitely not a big part of this whole story at all, which is usually a deterrant because those are the books I tend to gravitate towards, but Collins kept it interesting enough that I enjoyed it nonetheless.<br /><br />Collins' world within The Hunger Games was very creative and when Katniss and Peeta are thrown back into the Hunger Games again, it's exciting to see how things have changed and the new characters that come into play. This time around you see an even more vast array of characters as victors from all the previous games are brought into play and I actually liked them a lot better than the first round of characters, although I loved Rue, these characters are actually more important to the story and are more developed than the previous ones. I loved the new dangers, twists, and creativeness of the Games and the challenges the players have to face in order to survive.<br /><br />The book is really just the \\"middle of the movie\\" type of story where there's no real beginning or end to it, not that it's a bad thing. It definitely leaves you wanting more and I'm glad I waited so long so that I could read all the books straight through. Things are starting to get bigger and Katniss is beginning to see her world change and forcing her to grow and I'm anxious to see how her character turns out because she doesn't seem to have a real sense of her place in all this and when she finally realizes her role and how things must play out, then the real action begins. I do get a bit annoyed at how she always tries to play the martyr and how clueless she is throughout the story, but that is how it supposed to be I guess, since she must grow and learn in order for the story to progress well.<br /><br />It was truly a great read and a perfect stepping stone to the ultimate finish line of the whole story.

B005F3XV62|4.0|For the rating, I usually do out of 4, so I really give it 3 out of 4. Yes, this movie has talking animals, and thus a person might think hey it's like Night at the Museum because the animals are talking, and thus wow that's really cool that they can communicate with a Zookeeper person. However, this movie deals more with a love story.   The animals are helping find this guy love. This movie has a really good moral to love if you think about it. If I give it away, I might give away the entire movie, but to me it's more about a love story than it being about the animals. And there are funny parts like the Gorilla going to TGIFridays, and the Zookeeper peeing on the tree while the people are watching him, but it's just more about the love story.
0439023521|5.0|I heard about this book since Stephanie Meyer recommended it back when The Twilight Saga was just starting out and I immediately checked out the synopsis to see if it was something I'd be interested in. After finding out it was some kind of \\"adventure\\" book I wasn't really into it. I'm more of a romantic novel kind of person, where the focus in on the two main characters falling in love, but after years of hearing nothing but good things about it, I decided to give into the masses and read it. I have to say, I don't regret it at all.<br /><br />The action and suspense of the games really kept me going through this book and I finished it in no time. The beginning was kind of boring, which is usually the case in most books, but I love the intricate and details of the world that Suzanne Collins created and how the games are played out. Once it all got started, it was really hard to put the book down. The main character, Katniss, is definitely one you will adore, her love for her family and for people in general, makes you really care for the girl and hope for her survival through this inhumane and deadly game.<br /><br />I really liked how, through the games, Katniss discovers so much about herself, like her survival skills and what is it that makes her so special. You also get to see the animalistic nature, dangerousness, and kindness of the other participants of The Hunger Games that leaves you rooting for some and hating others. The way The Capitol uses these children in this crazy and dangerous game of theirs is ridiculous! The whole book is definitely quite suspenseful and sometimes it even had me at the edge of my seat, dying to know what would happen next. There is even a dramatic, and very unique twist towards the end of the game that left me in shock (I really enjoyed that part, though the whole thing was just crazy, you wouldn't even consider that to come into play). You also see her battling with herself as she has to actually kill people in this game, even those she doesn't want to, like her friend Peeta, who came from the same district as her. It leaves you thinking about all that you would have to do to survive and what you would have to sacrifice in order to stay alive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good read, then I highly recommend grabbing this book.

B00466HN86|5.0|I saw this movie about a week ago and it is still popping up in my mind, which is the sign of a great movie. Can't wait to buy the DVD.    Reading the reviews is instructive of what is going on in our culture.  The anti-Christian bigotry and intolerance is sad, but we have seen it throughout history. This is a very convicting movie, meaning that it makes you think about your choices.  It's ultimately a happy movie--joyful, actually--that gives you hope.  Surprisingly funny, too.  I have not laughed that hard in a movie for quite some time.    This is a hard-hitting movie without a single cussword.  Hollywood tries to punch up its films with profanity; this film keeps you riveted with a \\"you are there\\" story line that shakes you up.  It is two hours long and the intensity doesn't flag very often.  This is like a long roller coaster ride.  The ending was a little \\"heavy\\" for my tastes but as my husband pointed out, much of this film was aimed at guys and guys are not subtle, do not take hints very well, and need the straight up explanation provided at the end.    Re whether to bring kids:  I am protective of kids when it comes to movies but I think any kid 12 and up could get a lot out of this.  Only caveat would be if a child had recently lost a close relative or friend OR had issues of recent abandonment.  I'm not a child psychologist, but I think that some kids might not be emotionally strong enough to deal with this movie until issues like that are resolved.  In any case, I would recommend that the parent see the movie by himself first and then decide whether to let the child see it now or wait until later. This is an intense movie.
0142419400|5.0|After reading review after review of how wonderful this book is, I knew I had to get it for myself. Luckily, my Hubbi got me this for Christmas and when I was done with my other books, I dived right in. My overall experience with it is that I really do love it, but maybe the hype around it was too much that I had really high expectations for it that wasn't quite fulfilled.<br /><br />I think it is a really cute and simple book that would be perfect for a great \\"teen read\\". I suppose I was hoping for an epic love story that would unfold in the streets of Paris. Instead, the story was about a girl on the path to self-discovery who happens to find love along the way. I really enjoyed how Anna learned a lot about who she really was and how life in another country can really change you, for the better. The love story between her & Etienne, which I thought was going to be the main reason I liked this book, turned out to be more of a side story or added bonus to the book.<br /><br />The love story does progress well and I enjoyed their moments together, but it really did remind me of a typical teen scene of how they fall in love and the little moments that make them realize what they want. The secondary characters kept it interesting enough, which was great since usually those characters are kind of a bore to me as I'm more into the main characters and their storyline, but I really did like Anna's friends. I think Stephanie Perkins did an amazing job for her debut book and I would definitely recommend this book to a friend. It's NOT an epic love story, but a cute love story that will leave you with a smile in the end.

1416972250|5.0|City of Glass is the (original) final installment in The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare and I have to say, Clare definitely knows how to end a series with a BANG!<br /><br />I really enjoyed how it all ended and the details of each character's story and past was so creatively developed that you could see how Clare truly did create a world of her own. The ultimate twist of fate that Valentine created was so crazy, I definitely didn't expect it. Clare continued to hint at certain things and reveal others, which kept me engaged and fervently reading on and on until the end. Each of the characters shine in their own ways in this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed the witty and entertaining moments that Alec and Magnus created both together and separately. I can honestly say I didn't really care for Simon at first, but by the end of the series, I couldn't imagine that world without him and he turned into one of my favorites!  I also devoured the steamy and intimate scenes between Jace and Clary and I liked how their ending played out, whether for better or worse, I guess we'll see in the next book!<br /><br />The final showdown with Valentine was pretty epic, and what he did/how he got to where he is now is enough for anyone to want to read this book. You get to see jut how far he was/is willing to go to fight for what he believes in, regardless of how evil or wrong others may think it is. After realizing his best-kept secret, you'll be flying through the pages to see how it all ends. Loved it!<br /><br />Even though the next book, City of Fallen Angels is a bit different, I'm still very eager to read it and dive back into Clare's world. Definitely a series worth reading!

1416955070|5.0|I know I'm super late in reading this series but I'm so glad I finally did. Although not a \\"can't put it down\\" book, I really enjoyed it and found Cassandra Clare's writing to be descriptive and captivating. Clare does a great job of describing the characters and the scenery so that you can really picture it in your head. I love her use of words to paint a vivid picture that just stands out to you, the calling of a great author.<br /><br />The thing I loved most about this book was that it caught me from the very beginning. Most books start off slow making you linger and not really want to read the book but then it grabs you and forces you to finish it and that's all well and good but what about trying a different tactic? That's what Clare did. She pulled me in from the very beginning of the story and made me want to find out more about this mysterious \\"Shadowhunters\\" and what exactly was Clary's role in all this. Even though her history was a bit predictable, I knew who her father was right away, it was interesting to read about her mother, how Clary was hidden from it all, and her connection to Jace.<br /><br />Ah, Jace! When I think about him I imagine a young David Beckham; confident, built, and all \\"tattooed up\\". The relationship between him and Clary is very twisted and definitely different than the usual paranormal love story. And poor Simon, Clary's doting best friend, you can't help but feel for the boy and I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions between the three of them, Alec, and Isabelle. Another character I really liked was Magnus Bane, a witty guy that adds lightness and \\"magic\\" to the story.<br /><br />I have to say though, it did get a bit slow in the middle with little action and it wasn't until the end when things picked up and I felt like I had to read it until the end.<br /><br />One thing that caught my attention that I just couldn't get around was the large number of typos and confusing sentences scattered throughout the book. At first, I thought it was just how the story went, but after reading it a few times I'm sure that's not how it's supposed to be read. Obviously, typos do occur and that's not necessarily the author's fault, but still, for such a popular series, you'd think there would be more attention to detail.<br /><br />Overall, I highly enjoyed this book and I immediately jumped right into the second book, City of Ashes, to see what will happen next. I'm hoping for good things for Clary and Jace!ter reading it a few times I'm sure that's not how it's supposed to be read.

1416972242|5.0|This is the 2nd book in The Mortal Instruments Series and I have to say Cassandra Clare didn't disappoint. I was definitely eager to find out what happened next for Clary and Jace. I think this book had more action and kept me going more so than the first, although I loved the first book. The pace seemed quicker to me and kept me turning pages. Not only are even more characters introduced, certain things happen to the main characters that had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I really liked that Clary is starting to come into her own now and learning that she's a lot stronger than she thinks she is. Her power wouldn't seem to be all that important, but Clare makes it so that it's a necessary and empowering ability to have and I'm definitely all for showing that the lead girl isn't someone who needs to be saved all the time. There isn't much romance in this series in the way of kissing and intimate scenes, but you can sense the emotions and ongoing tension of the \\"love triangle\\" and I found myself jumping back and forth from Team Simon to Team Jace! But, of course, Jace just has that aura about him that makes you want him and Clary to be together, however weird and supposedly \\"incestuous\\" that may be. The mystery of \\"are they or aren't they brother and sister\\" still isn't solved in this book and Clare does a good job of throwing you off here and there to keep up the suspense. There were quite a few deaths in this book and you see the other characters starting to struggle more and more with their own issues and the looming war with Valentine.<br /><br />Clare still does a great job describing all the demons and the scenery so that definitely someone with a better imagination than mine can easily visualize to their liking. At some points it seemed as though it was a little too detailed, but that's just her way and I appreciate her attention to it. I was also pleased that there were fewer typos and confusing sentences as compared to the first book, again, not really her fault, so it made the book more enjoyable.<br /><br />I'm very eager to read City of Glass and see how it all ends!de the book more enjoyable.

1846144132|5.0|In this age of tweets and soundbytes, it's almost hard to believe (yet refreshing) that someone would have the poise to write a volume like this.<br /><br />My only complaint is the quality of the paper and the binding, which aren't top notch. But for the price, I can't complain. I hope it was worth the author's while.
0439023513|5.0|The 3rd book in The Hunger Games trilogy. This book is like a frenzy of action, characters, excitement, sorrow, and mystery. The underlying question is \\"Who is really the bad guy in all of this?\\" and Katniss has to discover that on her own because she is the ultimate symbol of this revolution and when you finally see Katniss transform from this simple, clueless girl to a shell of a person and then to a mature and capable adult who has faced some difficult times in her life that have changed her forever, yet is still able to go on and live a full life, albeit a bit damaged.<br /><br />This book was so heart-wrenching as there were quite a few deaths, some quite surprising and I honestly had to reread those parts of it to really believe that they died, I guess because I really didn't want them to. The battles between District 13 and The Capitol was very well written and you can get a strong sense of the pain and devastation that comes with war. There is a sense of sadness throughout the whole book and I liked how Collins took something so real and tragic as war and politics and placed it intricately in this dystopian world for people who wouldn't ordinarily think about these things.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised who Katniss chose to be with in the end and it was a bit downplayed and quiet, especially after all the action and tragedy but I really loved the Epilogue. Seeing their future was very heartwarming and I loved that Collins closed with that. I'm glad she didn't end the story in a \\"happy ending\\" kind of way and gave it a more real feeling that it deserved. This was a great ending to an amazing series.
0439023521|5.0|I found the novel The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, to be an amusing and captivating novel. It takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world where the capitol of Panem, 12 poor districts surrounded by a harsh, wealthy capitol, is conducting something called the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a televised fight to the death that acts as punishment for a past rebellion led by the 12 districts. Every year the capitol requires two names to be drawn from a raffle from each of the 12 districts, one boy and one girl from the ages of 12-18. The people with their names drawn will be sent to an arena will they will all try to kill each other on live television. When Katniss Everdeen's little sister, Prim, gets chosen Katniss must volunteer for her as the only way to save her life.   This book is extremely fast-paced, so it is extremely good for anyone who gets bored easily with slow books. I highly recommend it to people of all ages. The Hunger Games brings a new twist around every corner that keeps it captivating and hard to put down. One of the main reasons that I like this book is because the plot has constant threats that could appear at any moment and spice up the story even more. Many people might think this is just some violent, gory book, which it is, but there is also a love story that takes place throughout the book. I would recommend this book to boys and girls of all ages.
B00511ONPG|5.0|The structure and writing in this book is very clear, concise and helpful. Each short chapter outlines one aspect of how to use social media effectively with a clear rationale and supporting examples. Then it concludes with Action Items, which are things you can do to implement the suggestions for your business. The rationales are clear, the examples are illustrative and sometimes funny and the Action Items are real-world helpful. Any size business should find this book helpful. I am so eager to implement the steps in this book that before finishing reading my library copy, I ordered my own book. I will update after I have been using these methods for some time.

B005DI97S0|5.0|This is hands down my favorite of all the Vampire Chronicles series.  I am sure some people, particularly those with a religious background, can not get beyond the reflection this book creates on Christianity, but I LOVED it (to be fair, I was not raised in a religious family, nor am I religious now).<br /><br />As with her other books, I love the richness of her characters and the places we visit.  I love the pure genius and creativity of this novel in particular, which is why it is probably my favorite.  Her mind boggling rewrite of the Christian story is just remarkable; as long as you can avoid being offended by it, it is a mind blowing read.  I think it is important to note that she is not embracing these as her personal beliefs, nor does she even confirm that these visions of Lestat's are \\"real\\" in the novel (in fact, I think that might be the point - even if you see Heaven and/or Hell, how can you know that what you are seeing is real); it is left to the reader to determine their own feelings/beliefs about what Lestat saw.<br /><br />However, the extent to which this book made me think was outstanding to me; very few novels have made me do the mental exercises that this one did.  As always with the Vampire series, Anne hit it out of the park with this one.<br /><br />My only real complaint with this book is true of most of Anne's books; it takes forever to get going.  The entire plot with Roger and Dora was relatively pointless; the book would have been fine without it.  In fact, this book almost felt like Anne was writing two separate, shorter, books that she then combined into one.  The first half was, for me at least, relatively boring.  However, the second half more than makes up for the first.  I will grant the arguments from the one star reviewers that it is a bit out of character with the first 4 books, in that it arguably confirms the existence of God and the Devil, but I didn't really feel that it was jarring, nor do I feel that it detracts from the rest of the series.  It is also the first time since Interview that it is difficult to like Lestate.<br /><br />She does follow through on her theme from Queen of the Damned regarding what the world would be like if women were in charge through Dora, but it's a pretty tenuous link.  I do agree, however, that it could have easily been a stand alone book and that a stand alone might have been the better way to go.  I would also note that \\"woman\\" as Memnoch's downfall was not particularly original. However, none of that reduces the enjoyment I got from this book or my belief that it is an absolutely amazing contribution to Anne's work.<br /><br />In sum, if you find religion interesting from an intellectual standpoint, and you are willing/able to open your mind to a different perspective, your mind will be blown.  This book may challenge your existing views, regardless of what they are, and really make you think.  And, of course, many of our favorite Anne Rice characters make returns in this book, which is always refreshing, and her descriptive powers are well in evidence here.rest of the series.
