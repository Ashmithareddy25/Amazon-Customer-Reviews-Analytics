B00ARX2W24|5.0|I've been a Herb fan for 50 years and this album back in the day was brilliant. This 2013<br />remastered CD is amazing. They had to bake the master tapes in order to insure a smooth<br />play back and with todays digital technology and with Herb's and Randy's expertise, this<br />CD will blow you away. &#34;Route 101&#34; was a huge hit but I'm also enjoying &#34;Coco Loco&#34; and<br />&#34;Angel&#34;. Please visit HerbAlpertPresents.com for the total Herb Alpert experience. Interviews,<br />photos, videos and more remastered music for purchase! Fandango is a must for your<br />music collection, and if this is the first time you've heard Herb Alpert, you'll become a fan!
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|It's the entire family which is a plus, but the heads of Amber and Sophia keep popping off. The kids bend at the middle and the arms move. The parents only move their heads and arms.  They look very much like the tv show. We didn't buy the castle. It seemed overpriced. My daughters seem happy with it.

0316056898|4.0|This book, Bossypants, is a memoir by Tina Fey, and reflective of her personality: Witty, quirky, a little weird, a little messy, but entirely loveable. It's an offbeat rags-to-riches tale and shares the story of an awkward adolescent from the suburbs who grew up to be one of today's most successful and respected entertainers through perseverance and a good sense of humor. Tina Fey serves presents the expected heaping dose of her droll, self-deprecating humor, but she also provides a subtle and fascinating commentary on modern gender expectations and inequalities. The great thing about her, is that she can have her own strong set of opinions, but they're not always at the expense of others.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|There are millions of reviews of this book, so I don't have anything to add, only to voice my vote as this being an excellent dark fantasy book. Not everybody likes this book, and for valid reasons, but I enjoyed it. The novel is fast-paced and holds your attention, the world-building is astounding, the author's literary narrative is viciously sharp, and the plot is filled with climactic twists-and-turns. It's nuanced, carefully-planned, and from multiple perspectives which gives the reader a brought understanding of the story and characters. Overall, one could say the book is a bit familiar, but it is still a thrilling read.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|I have always been infatuated with Marylin because our childhoods, emotional issues and even our hourglass figures are so similar.  Watching this movie was an emotional experience because I see so much of myself in her, yet I feel that I am stronger than she was.  Michelle played the role beautifully.  I wish the movie had depicted more details about Marylin but I still enjoyed it alot.

0399165274|4.0|This is my first Fredrick Forsyth novel, and while it was a very enjoyable read, it was a bit more clinical and detatched compared to most military thriller novels.<br /><br />When a charismatic jihadist uses the internet to convert and direct followers into acts of terror, a secret U.S. agency is tasked with making an end to his threats.  The U.S. knows him only as \\"The Preacher,\\" and puts him on the \\"Kill List,\\" a list of enemies of the U.S. that are to be dealt with only by means of deadly force.  This novel chronicles the efforts to follow this unknown threat (unknown as to identity and even general location) and end the danger he presents.<br /><br />As this is my first Forsyth novel, I can't say if this was characteristic, but here, he used an impressive economy of words.  He essentially provides the entire life history of the protagonist in the first 20-25 pages, and moves from there to the main plot.  This economy (throughout the book) is both good and bad.  It makes for an extremely readable story, which will keep the reader engrossed and swept along in the plotting.  The downside is that there is not a lot of depth or description of most of the actions in the novel, so the reader feels somewhat detached, as if receiving the information from a briefing.  With very few exceptions (and then only very briefly) there's no emotion felt by any of the characters.  Somehow, the author still manages to evoke some emotional responses from the reader, but there was never any real concern that the villain would prevail or that things would not go as planned.<br /><br />All told, this was a very good read, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in a military novel.  It won't come across as a thriller, precisely, but it was very interesting and enjoyable.
0345525558|5.0|This was a  book you did not want to put down. From the very first page you are drawn into Victoria's inner most thoughts. You get a rare glimpse into the mindset of the thrown away children our society does not want to think about let alone discuss.

B00CRS88IO|2.0|It is sort of fun to read, but then You notice all the stupidity like jets and helicopters in WW2.
B008JFUMDS|3.0|For about half the movie, this slight-of-hand caper gets it right.  Although we don't get much of a backstory on the 4 magicians that are brought together by some secret organization called The Eye, we know from the beginning there is another involved.  Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) is the most successful of the group.  His former assistant, Henley (Isla Fisher) is a rising young star on her own, Woody Harrelson plays Merritt, a mind reader and hypnotist and Jack (Dave Franco) is a pick-pocket who lives day to day.<br /><br />Each, individually invited to join The Eye, collectively  become \\"The Four Horsemen\\" and are highly successful thanks in part to their benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine).  By \\"magic\\" they rob a Parisian bank, all while in view of a Las Vegas audience.  Seen in the trailers, the money is scattered from the ceiling of the auditorium where they are performing.<br /><br />This leads to an FBI investigation headed by Agent Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and accompanied by an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent).  Not forgetting that the 5th person involved in this magical heist is unknown, Morgan Freeman is introduced as Thaddeus Bradley, a former headliner who now makes a living on TV debunking magic tricks.  This is all pretty interesting until the tricks get more complicated, not to mention ridiculous and the Feds close in.  All the while, the FBI still look like fools.<br /><br />Then we get to the traditional action and we are left wanting with some (admittedly nifty) hand fighting between the wispy Jack and burly FBI agents.  That is followed with a car chase through busy Manhattan.  The film concludes with a reveal that had me shaking my head.  For a film that runs just under 2 hours, a lot is crammed in, including many twists and turns, plenty of misdirection and an encouraging offer to \\"look closer.\\"  Don't.

B005LAIHE0|3.0|I'll be honest, I would have given this movie a higher rating if they had another male lead.  I love Emily Blunt, and the rest of the cast is fine, but sorry, I'm not a fan of Jason Segal and pretty much every movie he's in, he pretty much cuts into my enjoyment of the film.  I just don't think he's that good of an actor, and basically plays the same character in every role.  The movie itself wasn't bad at all, and again, I think it would have been much better with a better leading man.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a disappointment ---did not like the characters.  Do not recommend it-there are too many good books out there!!!

B000OCXMAE|3.0|Bennington and co scale things back a bit with more pop-rock than the previous releases. The result is an entertaining, if not satisfying, 21st century pop-rock record. Same general emotional core, though with more introversion and guilt (plus a heaping helping of politics). It's an interesting step, but not nearly as compelling as &#34;Hybrid Theory&#34; or &#34;A Thousand Suns&#34;.

B008JFUP8A|3.0|From my wife Sarah: We were never bored, but it never got great. I'd still say it was an okay movie. Not a first choice movie, but most radical sci-fi fans like me will still want to see it.<br /><br />Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The story held our interest throughout, though it never got really got intense.<br /><br />- Will Smith has that quality that makes him a star.<br /><br />- It was an interesting premise, though I think it could have been carried out much better than it was.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The story lacked depth. They showed backstories for the characters, but they were just not written and performed in a way that gets you really invested. It just didn't have that great writing and acting that makes a movie compelling and great.<br /><br />- There were just so many, many plot holes in the story, that it kind of takes you into a state of continual skepticism. I found myself often questioning the realism of it. It's kind of what you'd expect from a B-Movie and not a headliner like this.<br /><br />I don't want to give any major spoilers, so here's a minor example (spoiler alert): The earth freezes over every single night with such a deep freeze that it will kill a person if exposed, so how do all the trees, plants and animals on this lush, green surface live? There's never any explanation. It's just not believable. As I said, this is a minor example - but there are many big plot holes, conflicts and things that make no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />- Will Smith played his character almost completely flat with almost little to no sign of emotion... While I understand why he may have chosen to do something like this based on the story, it was just too over the top flat. Will's a great actor and we're big fans, but it made it hard to get really connected to his character.<br /><br />- The story really revolved around the young boy's character played by Jaden Smith. He was just okay, but honestly he wasn't strong enough to carry it off in a compelling way.<br /><br />- CGI was not as convincing as it could have been. You're always aware that you're looking at computer generated images. That pulls you out of the fantasy.<br /><br />So I was mildly entertained throughout, but the quality could have been much better. I can't say that this is a must see, but an okay choice if you've run out of better things to see.to carry it off in a compelling way.<br /><br />- CGI was not as convincing as it could have been.

B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|I watched the movie, Rabbit Proof Fence. It was set in Australia in 1931 and was based on a true story. In the early 1900's there was a man name Mr. A.O. Neville that was considered the Chief Protector of Aboriginals. His goal was to \\"collect\\" all \\"half-caste\\" children from their native lands and teaching them the ways of the Australian people. Half castes were considered children that were half aboriginal and half white. He considered this to be a noble duty of his and he did this because \\"In spite of himself, the native must be helped.\\" The basis of the movie was about three young Aboriginal sisters that went on a long journey back to their native home of Jigalog. The three sisters were Molly, Gracie, and Daisy. They all were ripped from their families and taken to a concentration type camp run by what appeared to be nuns. Molly, the oldest at age 14, took guardianship over her two younger siblings. While at this camp, one day Molly decided it was time to \\"go home\\" and they set off on an adventure over 1200 miles.<br />The movie touched on the vast differences between the two religions or life ways. It showed the intolerance the Australian authorities had of the aboriginal ways. For example, when the three sisters were at the camp in Moore River, the adults were adamant about the children speaking English, instead of their native language. They were expected to forget the ways in which they were brought up, and embrace the ways of the Australian people. While watching the movie, you are also able to see the side of the aboriginals. For instance, the women of the tribes performed certain rituals that I looked at as their way of protecting their daughters on their difficult journey home. The three girls had a lot working against them that included time, Mother Nature, and adult officials with a lot of man power. The end result was both rewarding and saddening at the same time.<br />Overall, I found this movie to be fascinating and moving. This is not a typical moviethat I would normally watch, but I am very glad that I did.
B008QTUA5W|2.0|Carrie Mathison, the show's CIA-analyst lead, is erratic, mentally ill, and a criminal, but she loves her country and is also a genius. Secretly dosing herself with Clozapine to manage her bipolar disorder, Carrie harangues anyone who will listen about looming attacks. She thinks that Nicholas Brody, a recently rescued Marine prisoner of war, lauded on national news as an \\"American hero,\\" is working as a terrorist agent. To prove it, she illegally installs cameras and microphones in his family's house. \\"I'm just making sure we don't get hit again,\\" she says to a skeptical colleague. \\"I won't--I can`t let that happen again!\\"<br /><br />We're supposed to be somewhat skeptical of Carrie, and feel squeamish about her tactics, but we're left with the overall impression that, despite her flaws, and by extension Bush's or Obama's and their security apparatus, the results, however difficult they may be to swallow, justify the means.<br /><br />Homeland is a perfect dramatization of the rhetorical moves and political self-deceptions that made this now semi-permanent and very deadly war on terror possible.<br /><br />Still, though, Carrie is really pretty and effective, and Saul seems kind and thoughtful, so as long as we know we've got heroes like these out there (and the pretty, effective, kind and thoughtful Obama), then maybe we'll manage to stave off the barbarians at the gate for a little while longer.

B00BSBU4EC|3.0|I didn't really care for it the bad guy and his creepy horses really creeped me out i wouldnt recommend this  movie to anyone.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini is the only  author I have sent a note, to say \\"thank you\\" for writing a book. I loved the Kite Runner so much. I couldn't wait to read this new novel.  It started out beautifully and hooked me right into the story. However, somewhere in the middle of the book I lost track of who was related to whom and the story began to loose me.  I will have to read this a second time and make notes, or construct a family tree, to keep everyone straight in my mind. I longed to get lost in the feelings, imagery and storytelling of a Hosseini novel but that didn't entirely happen with this one. It was an immense undertaking to tell all of these stories, and adequately flesh out all the characters, in so short a novel.<br /><br />It pains me to say it, but this was not my favorite of his books.
B000SW4DV2|4.0|I give it a 4/5 its definitely a different kind of movie. Its about a robot that goes to the city and finds friends while trying to make a invention. its a cute and funny movie i think its for ages from 5-12 :D
B005EI86JU|5.0|Especially like it when he shares his recommendations for menu settings. It is much easier to read than the manual!
B003SI7OQ4|4.0|I loved this movie its a different kind of movie. its funny. its basically about a chicken who thinks the sky is falling but in reality it was just aliens coming and a really cute movie i think its for ages from 3-10 :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses, so I keep buying horse apps to satisfy my hunger for equine animals. This is the app best yet! I will admit it's not like a real horse, but comes in pretty close! The only thing I would fix is buying the gems. Bye for now, Absol!
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Most of the time writers and actors condescended to their characters, making them unsympathetically dumb and shallow. Belated injection of nobility at the end felt forced. Attempts at comedy yielded not a single grin or giggle. Tucker's usual schtick really did not fit. A shoulder shrug was our shared reaction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book! Hopefully the movie actually does it justice!! I could feel the tension the players felt while in the arena as if I were standing their fighting for my life with them!
B002PNDEXK|5.0|This movie was clean, realistic, and actually placed value on the friendship and compatibility of the two people entering into a relationship. It did not celebrate promiscuity, but valued integrity. It presented depth and kindred interaction between two people so you actually wanted them to be together and fall in love, rather than two people just finally giving in to sleeping together in a moment of passion after they had teased each other along for awhile. Refreshing! Admirable!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I would love to see these books go on forever.... I didn't know what to expect and was happy with how the series ended.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it!!!! I'm addicted to this story! Read it in three nights, couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|grim, but riveting evocation of a childhood suffered in poverty, due primarily to a father's alcoholism. The despair and degradation are tempered by moments of love and savouring of life.
0470913029|5.0|My story for 2013. I'll be 67 years old in a few weeks. Complete Blood Count (CBC) March 8. Diagnosed with the metabolic disorder Type 2 Diabetes April 17. No way would I take Onglyza. Google it to see possible side-effects. Didn't like the too-timid ADA diet recommendations. Scoured online for an eating plan. Found the Paleo Diet and the premise immediately made sense: 10,000 years of agriculture (grains and legumes plus dairy) is barely 4 tenths of 1% of the 2½ million years that humans were Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. It hardly seems like enough time to genetically evolve to properly metabolize the foods we all take for granted. OK, space-agers can't REALLY go true Paleo, but there's plenty of modern foodstuffs that qualify. I started my Paleo eating plan while waiting for the book to arrive (to be even better informed). Walked briskly 45 minutes daily. Did 3 45-minute freeweight workouts per week. Ate as per strict level 3 Paleo. By May 28 my blood pressure had gone from Stage 1 hypertension to normal. My morning fasting blood glucose went from 188 mg/dL (8.17 A1C) down to 84 mg/dL (normal - 4.55 A1C). My weight dropped from 244 to 216 lbs. Also note that after stabilizing these numbers for 3 months and reaching my goal weight (180-190 lbs), I may relax into one of the less restrictive levels of the Paleo eating plan. A few indulgences and treats will do little harm thanks to the overwhelming success of the basic eating plan. For me it's not going to be a temporary thing, so I don't even call it a \\"diet.\\" It's the way I'll live from now on. Thank you, Loren Cordain.<br /><br />UPDATE 30 November 2013 -- Since 17 April 2013 (when I started this eating/exercise regimen), I have lost a total of 52 lbs. My morning fasting blood glucose readings dropped well down into an acceptable range. I feel better than ever, but I should point out that I did the diametric OPPOSITE of the approach recommended in Cordain's books. Instead of starting out with the Relaxed 85:15 Paleo Diet and working my way to the stricter levels, I started out with a 100% STRICT version and gradually eased into the more forgiving versions. This is EXACTLY how it went for me...<br /><br />2013 March 8: 244 lbs + high blood pressure. Doctor says walk. Complete Blood Count. So I reduce portions (but not really dieting) and began walking 1.7 miles daily.<br /><br />2013 April 17: 239 lbs. Blood pressure slightly elevated. CBC indicates diagnosis of Type II diabetes. CBC Fasting Glucose: 231 mg/dL. Offered Onglyza for appetite control and weight loss. Declined drugs. Went online to research. Settled on Paleo Diet and made a firm decision to change my eating habits for life. Developed a plan and executed it exactly as planned.<br />PHASE 1: 100% STRICT Paleo + daily cardio + freeweights 2x-3x weekly.<br /><br />2012 May 28: 216 lbs. Blood pressure high end normal. Daily testing morning fasting glucose readings reduced from 213 mg/dL to under 113 in three weeks. Then down to a range between 81 and 110. Doctor and staff amazed at me losing 23 lbs in 6 weeks. Walked same 1.7 miles daily, freeweights twice weekly, and ate 100% STRICT Paleo. Doctor dismissed me for 6 months. Since I can now afford to lose weight more gradually until I reach my goal of 185 lbs...<br />PHASE 2: 95% 95:5 Paleo (3 non-Paleo portions [1 meal total] per week)<br />  + daily cardio walk but no freeweights (too HOT) June/July<br />PHASE 3: 90% 90:10 Paleo (6 non-Paleo portions [2 meals total] per week)<br />  + daily cardio walk but no freeweights (too HOT) August/September<br />PHASE 4: 85% 85:15 RELAXED Paleo (9 non-Paleo portions [3 meals total] per week)<br />  + daily cardio walk + back to freeweights 2x-3x weekly October/November<br /><br />2013 November 26: 192 lbs. Blood pressure slightly elevated but still in normal range. Doctor didn't even mention it. If he had, I would have replied, \\"I DON'T have high blood pressure... I drink COFFEE!\\" Ha! Doctor totally amazed. Why? Because mostpeople can't bring themselves to give up corn dogs? Lost another 24 lbs since May 28 for a total of 52 lbs lost in 37 weeks. Blood test this week. Results due in about 7-10 days. I expect my A1C to be well under 7, maybe even under 6. My morning fasting glucose readings now average about 90 mg/dL. I expect to attain my goal of 185 lbs sometime in the next few months. Buying new wardrobe a piece at a time.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014 August 25: Still walking and part-time freeweights as described above. Since my last update 9 months ago (and having achieved my primary goals of reducing my blood sugar {I don't even bother to prick my fingers any longer] and my weight [don't even own a scale] down to manageable levels), I relaxed my Paleo eating plan somewhat, but still within the recommended 85:15 RELAXED Paleo level described in the book (9 non-Paleo portions [3 meals total] per week) + daily cardio walk, etc. That was about 4 months ago and in fact it's a wee tad TOO relaxed (as I have actually gained back 4 lbs). Since I have a goal of keeping my weight in a narrow range around 185 pounds, I will get stricter again beginning in September. After all, losing a few pounds in a healthy way with the Paleo eating plan is in no way an imposition since I have now been maintaining my new lifestyle health program for over 16 months. Best changes I've ever implemented in my adult life. Incidentally, I used to buy pants with a 44-inch waist. Now I buy 36-inch or 38-inch depending on the brand name. To any who are motivated to purchase Dr. Cordain's \\"The Paleo Diet\\" because of my review here, know that I am just up ahead on the path. Stay motivated when it gets a bit challenging and I feel sure you'll catch up.people can't bring themselves to give up corn dogs?

B008IJT0CE|4.0|There is a large selection of sounds to choose from from natural to musical instruments and vocals. I like how the sounds can be layered into a personal mix and saved as a favorite. The timer is a great option as it takes me ages to fall asleep and I can set it to 30 mins.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The 3rd and final installment of the Matrix trilogy and what a fine job they did with it.Pop some popcorn,open a pop,and kick back to one of the best Sci Fi trilogies ever made.All 3 movies are non-stop action.Visuals are the best...support your favorite artists.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a full-fledged introvert who grew up in a family of extroverts and who always felt there was something wrong with me, I found this book to be a wonderful reassurance that it is okay to be who you are!
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|All you have to do is look at the numerous 5 star reviews to know that this is one great movie to watch.Its the best that Sci Fi has to offer.Stellar movie making,acting,and visuals.Great transfer....support your favorite artists.

B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show Nashville, and I am enjoying all of the music I have purchased that is from the show!
1468179993|1.0|Light-weight, TINY book of basic impressions of top speakers.<br /><br />I was very disappointed and would recommend as a best choice for speakers...<br /><br />Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs by Gallo.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|I am a huge Taylor Swift fan.  I purchased this without hearing any music based on being a fan.  This was a waste of my money and her talent.  I haven't found one song I like.
B009M588K8|5.0|Well written, enjoyed the story, was hard to put it down.  The details and  descriptions of  the various missions were real easy to understand.  I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history and appreciates military novels.
B000002LFZ|5.0|If you are a fan, this is a must have!  this is my third purchase as my previous ones either were the wrong format or worn out.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|After trying and buying several camera bags that were disappointments, I decided to try this bag. I was unsure of the quality since the price is so low...but it is perfect. I have had it now for three years and carry a Nikon DSLR, several lenses, a backup camera, accessories and spare batteries. The bag holds everything with room to spare. The compartments are all adjustable to your needs and are extremely well padded. It has held up in snow, blazing hot sun, the beach, and bad weather. So far, the bag has no rips or tears and the zippers are working like new. I wish I had found this bag first before I had wasted a load of money on others. That is money that could have been spent on important things like lenses. If you are a snob who must have name brand labels sewed to everything to boost your image, then this bag is not for you because it doesn't scream \\"look at me\\". But I find that very appealing. Criminals might just think this bag holds a biology book or sweaty workout clothes rather than a couple thousand dollars worth of high end gear. Definitely a five star bag.
B007HO392S|5.0|If you are a fan of Carrie Underwood, this cd is a must have, love it, it is a staple on my playist
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Runs great  on Acer Iconia A500. I enjoy time management games but they amp me up.  This is my favorite type of game, puzzles, hidden objects and a goal to achieve.  Great Job!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like the fact that you have to think how to make things and make things happen.it's physics for dummies!
B00000405W|5.0|I LOVE THE SONGS ON THIS CD.  SO MANY OF THE SONGS MADE ME TEAR UP.  THEY BRING SO MUCH TRUE EMOTION TRO MY HEART WITH PURE EMOTION.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just started playing and I'm addicted to it already.I love animal games.my kids also like playing or watching me play
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game to play and very addictive. Would have given 5 stars but it costs too much to buy the necessary products you need to get further in the game.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|We have two Kindle Fires at my house so both myself and my 8 year old have been playing. I have to admit that she seems to be doing much better so far.<br /><br />This game seems to be both a SIM/builder game with a bit of fighting against the game's A.I. and some PVP mixed in. There are lots of building quests so even if you are not interested in the PVP, there is a ton of other stuff to do.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great free App!
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|I really liked the first season of American Horror Story. After the first couple of episodes of Season 2, I wasn't sure the writers knew where they were going; the story lines seemed pretty fragmented and the alien element seemed out of place. It's gotten better as I've watched up to Episode 8 but I still like Season 1 more.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|Very valid concept, I believe, and my assessment was dead on accurate. Worth the read and filling out the form.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Good quality and fast delivery. I got this movie for my niece and she loves it! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Again another great cd of her's  I have  more than one. and this is another great Cd  with her great talent
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is the best Cuz its kool and it has over a thousand levels you can choose from so I reccomend this app to every one who is bored
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book not expecting much, but it was in VERY good condition! As far as the actual book goes, it is very easy to follow. I haven't made any of the recipes out of it yet, but I plan to as soon as I get married. I did read through some parts of the book and found some recipes that I am really looking forward to making.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I was not able to put the book down. Frank McCourt  draws the reader in , I w as sorry to finish it.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a great show!!! Very addicting.. A friend at work told me about it and I didn't think I would be interested in a show about a motorcycle gang... Not my kind of thing.. I am so glad I gave it a try my husband and I are totally hooked!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is awesome and addicting!  Graphics and music are beautiful and fun for any age.  I'm an adult and probably play with this app more than an other one on my Kindle Fire!
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|This solo album shows the real genius in the ELO band.  Although the missing of the strings took some getting use to.  Again, I finally got around to replacing the original vinyl.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|reacher at his best, armed with a motel key. fast-paced and players couldn't be identified, even  WITH a program, until the very end.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Big Jeff Lynne fan. It took a couple of listens to get to the like status....a few more will push me to 'love it'.  I thought he could have 'jeff lynned it up' a little more on some of the songs; but Jeff Lynne can't go wrong in my book.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|This movie was on the plane... ONLY option. Painful. Zero Stars. Stop it. I am mad at it. Who funded this crap?
B007C52NY2|5.0|Came in perfect condition, as promised, and earlier than expected. I've heard great things about this series and can't wait to read them all!
B00AEBB8TM|5.0|i'm so glad i had never bought the DVD counterpart of this film. The Blu-ray version is just absolutely phenomenal, especially the scenes with Kenny in hell. the CGI really stands out so well i actually skipped the movie backward just to watch the scenes again. very well job on the HD tranfer!!<br /><br />Blu-ray specs are as follows -<br /><br />Video: 1920x1080p 1.85:1 Widescreen<br />Audio: English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.<br />Subtitles: English/English SDH/French/Spanish<br /><br />Special Features: Commentary by Matt Stone & Trey Parker, Music Video & a theatrical trailer<br /><br />overall i highly recommend this to anyone considering buying the Blu-ray version, hope my review helped.
B000RF1QDI|5.0|I saw this movie on HBO this morning and thought it was such a spiritual, loving, honest movie - filled with grief of the surviving spouse and the emotions and pains that one must battle with.  This is such a pure movie that brought on so much healing for me.  This is a must see for those who question \\"what happens,\\" after the death of a spouse.  I could so relate to the dog dying as well - my household took our family pet's death so hard as well.  Definitely one for the library collection.
0547884591|5.0|Definitive guide to man cooking., absolutely loved it. It's not just a cookbook..it's a survival guide too..will read many times..
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is not the movie for when you're looking for light, breezy entertainment. Set in future time, The Hunger Games takes us to outrageous exploitation of the poor by the rich and powerful, and demonstrates that the weak and poor themselves may have the power to end their exploitation, simply by refusing to continue playing the game. On another dimension The Hunger Games also suggested to me the nature of war: the children of the poor sent off to kill and be killed for the benefit of the powerful. Not an easy entertainment, but greatly worth the time invested in viewing it.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I downloaded this game and played for months and spent 100$ in game purchases, then one day I clicked on it and it showed the loading screen then loaded half way. It stopped for a second then exited the game. Now whenever I click on it, it does the same thing. Gameloft won't help me.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I read this book last even though it's the first in a series of three books. I think because I saw the movie first but the book has some details that the movie left out. I enjoyed the characters of Lisbeth Salander & Mikael Blomkvist. I'm truly sorry that Stieg Larsson died because he had a true talent for writing and he will be missed.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommie Lee no matter what character he does in a movie plays it well.  John Goodman's take as a bad guy was great.  Since he is famous for a funny guy.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Of all the three books, each one can really stand alone because there is so much detail & plot. You only wish that the books would keep coming because the storyline could go for another 3 or 4 books easily!
B0080CKGZE|1.0|The movie was dull. Thought it would be more entertaining. But what could you expect from a kid from the twilight movies.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was fun but i wasnt ready for it to be over!!!! It needs more levels and an ending to the story in the letters
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love John Fogerty, but his hair looks totally bogus. I was excited when I read about this album being released, but I really hate singers doing duets and singing their tired old hits. The good news is that it's pretty decent and not boring.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I am just getting started on doctor who and I absolutely love it. It has action and romance and it's just amazing! I don't know how you can't love it!!
B00493E1GI|5.0|Julia Roberts plays a woman lost in her life. The romance of her life has ended and she is wandering around lost.  She tours the world only to discover that sometimes the best place to find yourself is within yourself.  I have seen this movie several times.  I love watching it and always find something I may have missed in previous viewing.  Many times as women we put so much of ourselves into relationships that we forget who we truly are. This movie is about self discovery.  I found myself laughing at some of the parts going OMG that is so me and other parts I was so glad it wasn't.  If you are looking for a feel good woman's movie this is the right movie for you.  A movie of a woman coming into her own.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I have been watching the tv show of PLL. It was amazing so I wanted to read the books. Book 1 is amazing you will love it so much. I'm on book 2 now.
0679805273|5.0|I use this for my fifth grade students as they make the transition from fifth grade to a middle school. Though they may not understand the full concept of this book right now my hopes as they get older re-read and they grasp the concept. I have used this book for the past 20 years and am so glad DR. SEUSS is still there for everyone!!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is one of the best games on my Kindle Fire recommended it to any one who likes online first person shooters.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Interesting read! Almost finished. Then to watch the movies and see how different it is. Wasn't expecting it to talk so much about football.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|the game is easy at the beginning but it is kind of hard to dodge the mines on later levels and it takes a lot of grenades to destroy a tank which makes it near impossible to move on without buying bazooka rounds.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|A fantastic journey into the world of fantasy.<br /><br />A film with a plasticity amazing images and movements of fantastic artists.<br />Another great successful production of Cirque Du Soleil.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I know for me it went to fast... I want more... It was a challenge a lot of times but I persevered through it... I can't wait till there are more rooms...And I know I'll still play this again and again....
B009NY43NY|5.0|Amazing!  Great book and tied it up so well!  Can't wait for November for the what happens after book!  Yay
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I've read all of Hosseini's books and have enjoyed them all, but this one definitely takes a different tack than the others.  There were some rough patches along the way, descriptions and language that were a little raw for my taste.  But in the end, Hosseini managed to elicit the same depth of emotion--that mixed feeling of loss, sadness, inevitability, and yet joy, perseverance, and victory--that he stirred within me with his previous works.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyed the book and good murder mystery...Connelly never lets his readers down.  The plot builds until the very end and the reader is never really sure what is going to happen next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Graphics have improved from the last temple run. The movements are slightly different but still fun. My three year old nephew wants to play but can't. Still not a toddler game and that's fine.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very good and puts a great band and it's history into perspective.The song writng as good as<br />McCartney and Lennon ever were if not better. Interesting take on the Don Felder episode.<br />Perhap's Glen cound have been a little contrite at the end. Enjoyed immensely over all.
B007N6EUHI|4.0|I got this to help me out with school. Thought it would be a different way to study. I really like it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After a long wait for free time I was finally able t  finish this amazing trilogy. I loved all three books an  I can't wait for the next two movies to come out. This series is a must read and I hope you found this review helpful an  may the odds be ever in your favor.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Klingon trial? worf cameo? dual kirks? witty bones and spock banter? what is not to love about this classic star trek movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Pretty big...but it's very useful, so I like it :D<br />This is the message in my secret language:<br />043556 /8('''/75 85…$ =346 7$3_7\\"\\", $9 8 \\"8;3 85 <&
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got very frustrated at some parts so I had to look it . Up but it's a very well done game. The end left open a good sequel so I'm really exited there's gonna be another
B000SGGUWS|2.0|I really thought it was boring because I all ready saw the tv show.but the story it self is okay:)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a good book but I would like to have known what everyone did and why they did it because of her killing coin
B008Y768XO|5.0|everytime I watch this movie I need a whole box of tissue. Super tear jerker!!!!!!!!! I recommend this to anyone.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I believe that Sophie Kinsella is an excellent and entertaining writer.  There was enough mystery to want to keep reading and comedy for enjoyment<br /><br />Kelley
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A good read for those who like a little bit of hope with their dystopia.  I can't remember when I've read 500 pages so quickly.  You'll know after the first 50 pages that this book is different, but stay with it, the quick shifts calm to a more steady, engaging pace of action.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game reminds me of the Red, White, Black series, as well as The Lord of the Rings.  A beautiful story, good triumphs evil, almost religious.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Read this and find out why the previous generations were much more intelligent than today.  This was mandatory reading.  Now, children read indoctrination stories about &#34;fairness&#34;; stories that leave them wholly ignorant.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I have listened to this cd straight through dozens of times and can not get enough. It was a very smart purchase as the songs have lifted my spirits through my difficult pregnancy. I plan to listen to this CD in the hospital as well, and it'll be played for my baby boy. Tracks 1 (Miracle) & 12 (Beautiful Boy) are my favorites and evoke so much emotion that I quickly find myself in tears--in a good way! Celine's voice is as exceptional as always and I would highly recommend this CD for anyone, regardless of their place in life. It's soothing, uplifting, and a pleasure to listen to!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Ordered it last night and my grandson loved every minute of it. Today his sister will be back from a trip and I'm sure she will love it too. Entertaining for the whole family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So far the game is fantastic and it works really well a new update(0.7.0) would be great as well with online play and a bunch of other stuff that would make this game the best game in history :D<br /><br />Overall buy it now!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun and challenging and super exciting with new stuff to unlock and vehicles it is just really affecting too.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was excellent. Both funny and sad and amazing because it is a true story.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Excellent, informative and factual, muckraking journalism. A must read if you want to know what goes into your food, and the marketing that dupes the average consumer into thinking that what they're eating is good for them.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book had an interesting twist at the end.  It was written well enough to hold my attention.  Good read.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|This series gave me much to think about life and the purpose of life.  I would recommend this series of anyone.
B004IK30S2|2.0|This movie overall was not a good piece of work. I do not remember any funny lines or anything that really made me laugh. The only saving grace is the acting. However the plot and the script leaves much to be desired. I would not watch it again.<br />  1) Plot - The movie starts with a very good idea, being about a 70's news anchor. This is what drew me in to see it. Unfortunately I would rate it a complete failure as a script and plot. I cannot really think of one scene or line that was great. Compare this to \\"Bridesmaids\\" or \\"Talladega Nights\\". Anchorman was a complete miss in this regard. It is a completely boring, unfunny, uninteresting plot which becomes a chore to sit through.<br />  2) Acting - Will Ferrell and Applegate and a host of actors (Vaughn, Robbins, etc) all brought much energy to the movie. Unfortunately they had nothing to work with regard to the script and plot.<br />  3) Environment - The clothing was interesting in showing the 70's but overall it was not impressive. I would have liked to see more shops, technology, and other images that captured the world of the 70's.<br /><br />  It is worth seeing once because of Will Ferrell but I think that few are going to think it is funny or worth seeing again. I had to force myself to not fast-forward through the DVR recording.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I'm having a great time with my space birds. I have the original one too and it's great. I'll get more of the birds in the future
B0098756DC|2.0|picture was outstanding but the audio track was off since the actors/acctress lips did not synch with soundtrack in a couple of spots; it was disappoint since I replacing the old paramount centennial DVD
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It gives all the other apps self esteem issues.<br />All the apps who meet this app feel bad about how boring they are and kill themselves in a hole.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|My brother updated his iPad version to Miami last Tuesday. Where is that update for the kindle? There are weekly challenges to do I am missing because of not getting the update and also losing time to unlock limited time hoverboard and character.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great job on the album. Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys piano and cello music.<br />Would have loved to seen this one offered as CD/DVD combo as well.
0738737909|3.0|I pre-ordered the kit from Amazon months ago after seeing and loving the deck on Facebook.  I got it this week.  I've been going through the deck since then and I have such mixed feelings.<br /><br />What I love: This is a beautiful deck. The colors! The lavish, sumptuousness feeling of the textures, costumes and details; the cat and the Queen of Wands; the Empress; the surprisingly wonderful feel of the cards and the beautiful gilt edges; borderless cards<br /><br />What I don't love: The flat static quality of the deck was a shock in the midst of all that swirling energy and vibrancy; There is an \\"Aquarian Tarot\\" feel of some of the faces (a washed out misty feel) just doesn't fit with the richness of colors; the size of some of the heads were proportionally very small causing them to look peculiar; The imagery can be chaotic and unclear...the Chariot is the perfect example...don't quite know what's going on there and symbols get lost in translation...what's with those horses?; Really dislike the Star (a card I usually love), and the Devil; Lastly, there is a preponderance of platinum blonds throughout the deck that quite puts me off for some reason.<br /><br />I am both drawn and not drawn to this deck so far, but I can't see myself using it for readings at this time.  Maybe it will grow on me. I so wanted to love it.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys piano and cello music.<br />The Deluxe Edition with the CD/DVD combo is the best.
B00CW665VI|4.0|It was a nice change to get into the inner workings of a man's mind. And Drew is just not any man, he's a player and a damn funny and blatantly honest one. If you are looking for a fun, steamy read with a hot guy and a pretty kick ass take no BS leading lady you can't go wrong with this one.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Ok, here, we go. where no hack director has gone.<br /><br />You have a generic villain with a generic name who goes back in time to blow up Vulcan because he blames it for his his home being destroyed.<br />Now wait, if he is from the future, he would already know what happened and prevented it, and not blame Vulcan which was innocent,<br />but wait!! I for got he is mad, because he Nero. This is a clear sign of a hack director and writing.<br /><br />The crew look like a bunch of uppity metrosexuals trying to imitate the original actors, who looked way more real than this crap.<br /><br />You had lame lines, for instance, the young Kirk who yells out his full name. Who does that? What kid in this time or any other talks like that.<br />Uhura is basically ship whore and has a relationship with Spock which makes no sense.<br />Jar Jar Abrams basically took everything that was cool about the original crew movies and made a mockery of it.<br />From the Kobyashi Maru test to Kirk being Captain.<br />Sorry Abrams, but lense flares, pretty cgi and explosions do not make a Star Trek movie. Star Trek was more than that.<br />This may may be fan boy heaven BUT it is NOT Star Trek Heaven.
B008OOYALE|5.0|cool game wish there was an easier way to earn gold bars. Hard to breed and create some dragons. Very hard to get diamond dragon.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If you have Dragon Story or Tiny Monsters: delete them. Get DragonVale. Seriously. This is much better graphic-wise, breed-availability-wise, and any other kind of -wise you can think of. AND it's freaking FREE!!! I've been playing for 3 months and even though in my room the internet is really bad and its hard to race with bad internet, it hasn't permanently crashed, and even if it had, it would only drop 1 star. That's how amazing it is.<br />Honestly? Just try it yourself and see!<br />Evynlin Diae, the RavenclawAuthor
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Not much I didn't already know - just a bit more gruesome seeing it in real life.  Enough to make you promise to seek out organic food and buy meat from local farmers who don't drug and torture the animals.  Anyone who could eat fast food after seeing this is more brave than I!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I loved the series on TV. Temperance Brennan is a wonderful writer. Love all her books.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Ms  Chase has a great knack for creating a character driven story accented with intriguing natural narrative, good character arcs,dips and turns and several smile out loud moments.  This was a completely enjoyable read that kept me interested from start to finish.  I look forward to more books!
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Interesting movie, great scenery, outstanding music, high quality actors . Stunt performers were excellent  The ending was a surprise<br />.....I wish I had known more about the history of the region.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like temple run whixh is another amazing game. This is really fun and I hope every one enjoys it
0439023521|5.0|The Book Was Awesome I was Glad that the book and the movie were very similar but I was upset they only had one kiss in the movie and ore in the book but whatever. Once I started reading the book i could not put it down so i definitely suggest that anyone gives it a read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is well thought out. Perfect timing, as I'm a mom that has taken an extended maternity leave, but will be returning to the workforce shortly. I would recommend this book to any and every one.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love this game! Great graphics. Hidden object plus puzzles and a mystery all in one. Wish more games were like this one.
1475143389|5.0|this book is a great asset for beginner like me or and even one who is trying to gain muscle quickly...This sets u up on right path of success on building your great body.....remember this is tool and not All-in-In....one are the one need to work hard and give time!<br /><br />I am too early to say if this worked for me or not but what said here is seems logical to me...<br /><br />Good luck!!<br /><br />As a bonus , the author has very nice online website the get more info.... he seems ready to help &#34;personally&#34; that is I haven't seen anywhere before!!
B002EBDP9G|1.0|This book is wrong from its title. Without any critical view. It reminds historians of a century ago, for which the story exists only for the winner. Full of biased opinions and besides that, full of factual errors about the history of this new country that was created in North America during the past four centuries. Which is called United States and not America. Because I think thta America is all a continent and the history of American People began long far before...
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book was informative and easy to follow. I found myself applying some of the lessons in this book immediately.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I found this story very amusing but very accurate andsadly too often seen in real life. Marian Keyes is really up standard in Rachels Holiday
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this book aloud to my hubby on our 12 hour car trip recently. Great book for that and kept us both riveted to the story the whole trip even though I had already seen the movie. Great read!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Probably peerless in this genre. It was deep, funny, extremely well written and, of course, graphic. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. Every page had a rhythm that carried the plot along efficiently. If i had anything bad to say, it would be about how maybe it touched on too many underlying themes and tried perhaps to say too much at once.  This, in turn, set itself up for what I felt were inadequate answers to some questions it raised. It's final point (the last of its many points) in my opinion is that human nature is flawed and ultimately destructive. No person, not even super heroes, can truly save the world from itself, less they change human nature or destroy it. All that is left to do is appreciate life's commonly unappreciated offerings. Let go, make love, and truly understand life as rare, fragile, and finite.
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|I like the music, very fun listening too, my grand daughters like the C.D. too. I listen to it often.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I am really enjoying this collection. However, after I dfownloaded the purchased version I had a terrible time finding my oplace.
B000002KGT|5.0|I had a copy of this album many years ago, but lost it in a move ot a new home.  This brings back a lot of good memories from my early years.  A must have for every Fleetwood Mac fan.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Bradley Cooper - Sensitive, Romantic, Handsome. Jennifer Lawrence - Smart, Funny, Tough. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver - Well Intentioned, Loving and Supporting. With the story and performances you walk away feeling like you've really experienced some heartbreaking and harrowing experiences with a group of people that you've grown to love. If someone forced me to choose only one of my DVDs to take with me in the event of an emergency, knowing I could never watch any of my other movies again, I would pick Silver Linings Playbook because it's just that good.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Couldn't have been better!  Enjoyed every minute of the music and the interviews.  This film helped fill in some gaps for me and the reasons behind some of the personnel changes over the years.  fi you are a fan of the Eagles, this is a must see!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Outstanding purchase and loved this DVD as it was touching and a great story. Received on time and I would buy from this group again and again. Thank you; MAM
B00821OUT6|5.0|I'm addicted to this series. I watched season 1 one night, straight through, and season 2 the next. It's kind of a mix between The Walking Dead and the early episodes of StarGate... Very good start to a hopefully long lived series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could you fathom your son doing such a deed ? Could you imagine going thru a trial ? How would you cope with this ordeal ?  Read  and you will be surprised.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use this App on my Asus Transformer TF300 and my HTC Butterfly, and I love it's capabilities and ease of use! Highly recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book.  I didn't see it as political as it seemed to be portrayed.  I can see how his buddies might not like it, but I thought it was pretty benign from a national security point of view.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game.. All out fun can't put it down wished that I had more coins to buy more weapons.. Great game..
B006VFLIYK|5.0|very, very good  but be sure to read The Innocent before you read The Hit---different story line BUT there's info in The Hit which gives away something big in The Innocent
B0002CVQCW|5.0|This was a gift for my mother's 86th birthday, and she absolutely loved it. She has already watched it twice.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Thick plot, bizarre journey of technology and magic together. I loved every bit of it. Took me back in time, and took me ahead of time. :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is even better than Weather Channel. It gets the weather exact almost every time. I never leave the house without checking it. I absolutely love it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is one of the best Scribblenaughts apps yet. Seriously is you don't love this app then there is something totally wrong in your noggin.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun. It teaches you patience and skill. I really like this game. Play this game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very hard to put down. Love the characters.<br />Great series. Would like more of them.  Very sultry. Very good job.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game and I hope everyone who gets it loves it too<br />From jets576<br />Ps. Check out minecraft too
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This app is a lot of fun, very addicting, but it deleted everything!!! All of my money that I worked hard for was gone. Kim an Harumi are gone!!!!! Even my awesome high score was gone. It's not fair, I worked very hard to get all of those and now I have to start all over again. I even lost all of my missions. :( if anyone knows a glitch to get Kim and Harumi back please please let me know. Otherwise GET THIS APP ITS AWESOME, BUT NEVER REMOVE IT FROM YOUR DEVICE. PROGRESS WILL BE LOST!!!!! Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way. Hope this was helpful :D
B00009YUPY|5.0|After having for only a week, it is the best sub 20 dollar mouse I've owned to date.  No frills, but it does what I need... it scrolls, it clicks, and no annoying double click business (when it is unwanted) that seems to be more prevalent with other cheaper mouse models.  I recommend this mouse.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|thought I would give it a try simmply out of boredom and haven't been able to put it down. VERY addicting and the graphics are unreal to be a tablet app. definately a 5 star rating.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I bought this motherboard solely for the fact that it appeared to be the most capable to put my AMD FX8350 chip into.  Having capability of 32 gigs of ram didn't hurt either.  USB 3.0 is there.  It is cross fire capable, but I don't play any games (yet) that would need that and as such I only have one graphics card (AMD HD7850).<br /><br />It seems that it will be able to accept chip updates in the future as AMD creates faster pile driver chips.  I like that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I installed this on my daughter's tablet, her computer, and my computer.  This gives her the chance to do her writing at any location and to keep her stories synced together.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game is fun to play. Simply move the cards with a touch of the finger on your kindle fire.<br /><br />Winning deals are not always winning deals don't plan on winning every game.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|My wife and I love this movie. Can't really find fault with it. Excellent characterizations, fun to watch. Of course it has Johnny Depp in another somewhat zanny roll, but he's believable.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Downloaded the game because my daughter wanted to play it and she was able to do really well for a while. Then the game seems to become unbeatable and very frustrating.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great little game - challenging and fun. I enjoy the new setups at every level. It is one of my favorites.
0316228532|5.0|Nice book with a twist. I enjoyed reading this, and loaned it to my sister for her reading pleasure and enjoyment.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|\\"Submarine, the directorial debut by The I.T. Crowd's Richard Ayoade (who also starred in the recent film, The Watch), tells the story of a young man named Oliver Tate who is entangled by the complexities he has with the relationships of his love interest, Jordana Brewster, his quiet oceanography professor for a father, and Oliver's mother willing to date someone else other than her husband.<br /><br />The film, as a whole, prides on a quirky whimsy evident in much of the works of Wes Anderson (Rushmore brings into mind) and French New Wave cinema with its experimental shots of emotion and character. It is not entirely certain if Ayoade made the script with this intention or the novel characterises much of the craziness within Tate's mind. If it is one way or the other, the film is delightfully well done (in terms of cinematography, choice of music, and colour scheme), snappy, witty (in a dry way), and consistent enough to hold its own ground with its slightly schizophrenic perspective of a teenager's mentality. The film does suffer a bit with moments of too much distance and whimsical silence by its characters that it makes them a bit cartoonish.<br /><br />However, the film is nonetheless more realistic, more to heart, and less sporadic than many of its modern counterparts (i.e. Superbad, Project X). In addition, the film's strong collaboration with the production team from Film4 (part of Channel 4) and Warp Films make for a work that is not only interesting but, moreover, something definitive of their established brands.\\"
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fine, but before each game the screen goes to black and there is an ad. To remove the ad you must pull up a menu that has skip ad on it. The menu is down near where the button for the menu bar is for the kindle. I have trouble getting the skip ad button to show.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Words can't even describe how incredible this book is. With a twist that makes you want to rewind and read it over and over, I didn't put the book down until it was finished. A solid 5 hour read and my mind was blown.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|I like the comic films in generall, thats why i ordered this film. A really great movie with my favourite film roll, Heath Ledger
B0014C0BMU|5.0|What can I say?  I was so impressed with the first movie that I really couldn't be disappointed with the rest of them.  I think the trilogy should stay just that.  I was satisfied with all of them telling a story.  This movie had a lot of epic moments, so I'm not going to mention them and spoil the film.
1848321600|5.0|I liked the book, and the comparison of different areas from other Historic ship models was outstanding and the first time I had seen this method of examination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its been 5 days since subway suffers has been updated to Miami and I still don't have it. I just don't know how to update it does anyone have any suggestions.
B007DIQC90|5.0|this is a great album from beginning to the end. Enjoyed every song. One of the best indy bands around.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Well worth the read, beautiful and painful at times, a great story. Sets the scene in the Irish countryside and in the past so well.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Book Two was not as good as Book One. But, since I already read the first book, I wanted to finish the Trilogy series. I found the story rather corny and boring in parts.  I had to skip some parts or speed read through several sections as it became a chore for me to read.  This Trilogy is for high school girls or young adults. I would not read this again.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I LOVE Ellen's sense of humor!  I can just hear/see her saying all of the crazy/hilarious things she writes in this book.  I was laughing hysterically thought entire book.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Although this book was boring, I wanted to finish what I started.  I usually don't read fiction but decided to read this Trilogy due to all the buzz around the office about how good this Trilogy was.  In my opinion, I thought it was boring, dry, and corny.  I think this book is mostly for high school girls.  I think I will go back to my True Crime books instead. This book is not worth buying. Try and borrow it from a friend and save yourself money.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Probably my favorite album by Moby.Really like Run On, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad, Honey, Bodyrock, Natural Blues, Machete.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so worth it!<br /> It's so fun to make stuff like homes and boats and tree houses<br />I like play survival with my friends!<br />So fun so worth it!!!!!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Great songs as always! The vocals and harmonies are outstanding!  The lyrics touch on things everyone can surely relate to!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I was initially looking for a standard cup holder for my McClaren XLR and ran across this item. While sceptical at first the price was so affordable I figured I'd give it a try, besides all of the reviews I read were excellent. And the reviews were right!!! Not only is the holder convenient and sturdy but very efficient. It can hold almost anything and not slide or flip over, its so good I've ordered a second one for my Stokke and am telling all my stroller mom friends about it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down. It is an easy read and an amazing book.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|Since it was based on truth it was fascinating.  But Follett has too many sexual details that could better be left out.
B008220D5K|5.0|Its amazing how many situations in this movie are very close to home!<br />Laughed through out the movie! Have fun!!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|If you love any of the Stargate series, you'll love Stagate Universe. Just very upset that they canceled after season 2.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Been playing this for months, made it to level 35 then it starts bugging me for my Facebook login to play. I agree, it starts filling my page with Jurassic park stuff THEN I can't login without Facebook AND IT takes me BACK to level 9!!!! I have spent countless hours on this, had been thinking it WAS one of the best free<br />games out there BUT NO LONGER. DON'T spend any money here, folks or this could be YOU.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Delighted at the simple yet profoundly thought provoking message. Thoroughly enjoyed every story with in the story.  I look forward to more books in this genre.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is really fun open sandbox game that has gangsters cops zombie and other stuff like cars jets and boats
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great game - kept me interested for quite a while.  I loved getting through it - I just wish there were different options or scenarios so you could play it over and over.  I loved it!
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I got Silk Degrees back when I was in college, and then lost track of Boz for many years.  I was kind of surprised when I found &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; last year, and thought it was a phenomenal album.  I have been looking forward to his next album.  This one did not disappoint!  Am so getting comfortable reacquainting myself with his music.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Hey guys I just wanted to say this game is awesome. I downloaded io my Kindle Fire and it did in fact install for me. If it does not for you, instead of complaining please contact Kindle Fire support. Warner Bros is NOT responsible for your devices difficulties.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Best package deal yet! Hours of awesome family entertainment at the best price ever. Totally recommended for every Harry Potter fan!
B00D0K0UPW|5.0|I've been waiting for an interesting show to come my way and this really is an awesome series.  Please keep it going for more than a few years.  I HATE when great shows like this get cancelled after the first season.  This series reminds me of the old 1980's movie Anna to the Infinite Power (which was created way before it's time).
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I just happened upon this CD. I loved Leonard Cohen in my youth and this brought it all back.  All of his CDs are wonderful.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I have a 5 year old son that always has to figure out how everything works.  So, this game was perfect for him!  He played for an hour straight.
B0061S073A|4.0|I started using this after my two year old factory reset my kindle and I had to set up my whole device again. It is reassuring to be able to give her freedom in choosing apps while not worrying about what she might do. Easier to use than the parental control feature but I do find exiting kids place slow and cumbersome.
B008M721MS|5.0|love it genuinely great app i use to communicate with all my friends and family no matter where they are
B000S81MHY|5.0|This table works great with a drill press incorporating the stability of a vise and adjustability necessary for accurate cuts.
B004BEMC6G|2.0|The audio is so bad -- garbled, bass and treble out of whack, fuzzy, etc -- on the instant version that I requested (and received) a full refund. Until they fix this issue, I'd avoid buying this as an instant video.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|This book provides an insight into what may be going on within us.  The possibilities posed were quite interesting.  Okay
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite books ever second only to lone survivor by Marcus Luttrell. Chris Kyle is a humble as well as funny true American hero.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Must for people interested in enjoying learning. I would highly recommend this book specially for students, engineers, doctors, lawyers etc
0143116738|5.0|This book, if you let it, can be really life changing. It helps you to think differently about education (which is currently a very important and heated political topic right now) but it's main focus is not really about education. This book really strikes home to central message that any and every TED talk is about; passion, elemental passion. This book details the lives of many different people and how they discovered their element (which is where passion meets natural skill, talent or aptitude) and it is always encouraging you to go out and find it yourself. Even if what you are passionate about does not make you money, or does not make you a lot of money, it is still something that can change your life forever.<br /><br />Also, I just love this idea of combining a senior citizen home with an elementary school, seriously why don't we do this more often! Ch. 9 &#34;Is It Too Late&#34; goes in to far more detail than I will here, but it is an amazing idea where seniors walk by children every day and then they start to volunteer with them. It's a great idea for teaching literacy with young children and it's a great idea for improving the quality of lives in seniors everywhere. Why doesn't this happen more often???
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|A while back restorers removed the accumulated grime from the Sistine Chapel ceiling, bringing the colors and nuances of the paintings back to a cleaned-up, original beauty. Maybe this version of \\"Wings Over America\\" isn't in quite the same league, but for McCartney fans this re-mastering definitely has a cleaned-up, improved sound quality which makes this terrific 2-CD album (standard edition) even a little greater to listen to. Now, the improvements aren't hugely dramatic--maybe 15% to 20% cleaner, less muddy sound with better separation of background horns and guitars and crisper lead vocals than the last CD version available. The volume level is slightly higher than before, too. But, to my ears, it is an improved listening experience of one of my favorite McCartney albums. Of course, some of it is nostalgia for me: when the 3-record LP first came out, I would sit in my room at night with my Rick bass and big amp and play(?) along until I was asked (directed) to \\"turn it down.\\" Now, these CDs are going in my sound system and cranked up to be enjoyed all over again, but sounding somewhat different and a noticeable bit better than ever before.
B0093CNAJY|5.0|If you have ever worked in an office environment you have got to watch this.<br />If all your friends watch it you will all be quoting from the movie!<br />For such an old movie it is still very relevant.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show just keeps getting better, and more loving. I highly recommend this season 2 if you loved season 1
B003G4W49C|5.0|This author has the amazing ability to pull you in!  Definitely worth every penny.  If you're looking for something to immerse yourself in, pick this book.  Starting the rest of the series now!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'll admit that this was far from the feel-good, rah-rah, you-can-do-it book I'm used to from successful business leaders. I devoured most of it on a Saturday when I could have been doing a dozen other things. It was honest and thoughtful - wise words for both women and men, long-time professionals and those entering the work force.<br /><br />It was so so so refreshing to hear from an author and leader who refrains from simply telling the most glowing stories, but rather opts to share as many mistakes and &#34;I shoulda's&#34; as examples of what to do.<br /><br />Not leaning in is no longer an option.
B009NY43NY|1.0|SPOILER.... I finished this book and cried for 15 minutes at the death of the idea that after all these years Sookie would have a loving, and hot relationship......I've loved Sookie, ....I've loved Eric.  After years, we end up with nothing, Sookie, goes to bed alone at the end (and that is truly sadistic to the readers that have been there for years), with the same dead end job, with ONLY the  possibilty of a romance in the future with a man, Sam, where there has been no real past chemistry to speak of .... & Eric turns into a worthless stranger, bordering on cruel and his actions in this book are a slap in the face for anyone whose been a follower.<br />I'll NEVER READ ANOTHER BOOK SHE WRITES.

0425182177|5.0|Loved the book and the movie and just got a copy of it off of ioffer.com.  This was one of the original miniseries and it had a star studded cast in the movie.<br /><br />It revolves around the banking industry, involves the mob and affairs with high classed prostitution.  Blackmailing is involved.  It's a hard book to put down once you start it.

B00A8307BG|4.0|Poor guy, 'Bridge of Sighs' was sooo long ago, and set the bar sooo high...<br /><br />There are a few old timers still putting albums out, whose CDs I still buy. Some of them I buy because I'm a completist, or for nostalgia. Or, maybe to help them out.<br /><br />I still look forward to RT's new albums, and still enjoy them. He's kind of settling in to a mellow, blues place; and seems to have gained confidence in his singing.<br /><br />If I were a fire, wine, and cigar kind of guy; that might be how current RT makes me feel. Since I'm not, I just dim the light and share my LazyBoy with him.

B009MO5960|1.0|Me and my wife tried to watch Retribution yesterday and didn't even make it 30 min in before turning it off. My wife use to play the original game, and thought the first couple of movies did the game justice, as did the Silent Hill movie, but as the RE movies have went on, the story line got little worse and worse and futher away from the games which it was based. Retribution was incredibly horrible. Even the first 5 minutes of the movie playing the last 5 minutes of last movie in reverse was so stupid, to only have it replay again. Made us wonder if they were really that hard up for story line that they used it as filler. I would say if the plan was to continue down the current path with the RE movies, don't, as its just a waste of studios money on production. #Milla Jovovich﻿ you have some very good movies on your resume. Please don't let them insult you with another one like Retribution. Don't mean to offend anyone, just giving honest feedback.

0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One. Hmm. There are two sides to this book that I want to comment on, and they’re very different from one another.<br /><br />The good first. This book is very intelligently written. It has a good pace, it doesn’t drag, and the author has a good sense of progression, climax, and closure. He develops his characters, but doesn’t overdo it. He incorporates a love story but doesn’t lose his grip on his main plot in doing so. In fact, I started to think the love story was obnoxious, but then realized that it was, in fact, a perfect replica of what love is like at that age. Well played, Cline. Well played indeed. My highest praise is that he smoothly and successfully manages to bridge the gap between novel and pop culture, kinda like that friend of yours who can smoothly work a movie quote into conversation without it being obnoxious about it.<br /><br />Now the bad. You know how some bands have concerts and shout “Yeah! We love (insert your city’s name here)!!! You’re awesome!”? And you get that feeling that they just do that at all their concerts because it makes the audience feel like it’s “their band”? This book does that bigtime. This makes the book seem kinda sales-pitchy in parts, almost like a used-car salesman hustle vibe. It’ll get to you. You also end up feeling like the author is trying so hard to show off his geek-culture knowledge that it trips up the story. Was it enough to make me not enjoy the book? No way! BUT, I’m not typically the kind of guy who is put off by that kind of thing, and it bugged me a little. If you get irked by that, this book might give you a rash.
B009HOU672|5.0|A good quality recording of a creative, modern, minimilistic reinterpretation of Vivaldi's best known work. I would definitely recommend Vivaldi Recomposed.

B00AG297GK|4.0|I had very little expectations of this movie, after all, I loved Borat and Brüno because they weren't scripted for the most part and I'm a big fan of pranks and seeing people's reactions to weirdos like Baron Choen's characters. However, this was a really funny comedy of its own, with its humor elements inherited from the previous two movies but completely scripted. Just a stupid funny movie that will make you laugh, don't expect anything else and you'll enjoy it if you like to laugh at stupid stuff. If that's not your thing then skip it.

B009NY43NY|5.0|The last in this series (I guess all good things have to end)  This was another great mystery with loads of twists. It gives us a chance to see how a few old friends have settled their lives; ties up all loose ends nicely and leaves the reader satisfied that Sookie is a survivor and will always make lemonade out of her lemons.  As with previous Stackhouse novels, I couldn’t put it down.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I have been listening to AIC \\"Black gives way to blue\\" a lot and just by chance, I was walking through the electronics section of Target and saw a new AIC album!!  I was so excited.  I haven't bought a new cd from the store for probably 6 months or a year but I couldn't pass this one up!  Well, it's a few days later and I'm loving EVERY song on this album.  Great job again guys!!<br /><br />I don't understand those who write bad things about this band post Staley.  These past two albums have been the best ones to date in my opinion.  Let the band continue on.  Without Jerry, the band could not exist, but so long as he's around, AIC can continue on.  If I heard any one of these newer songs on the radio, it would easy to say...hey..it's Alice In Chains!!<br /><br />People who complain about this....well, you are the next generation of people that will be at a bar playing the same old songs on the jukebox even though we've heard them a million times.  Like those old guys that still play \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Freebird\\", etc.  Makes me want kill the jukebox.  You'll be the one playing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Down In a Hole\\", and \\"Jeremy\\" over and over and over.  As if these bands never did anything more.<br /><br />I hope this reincarnation of AIC continues and we get another album in the future.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|A documentary on the electric guitar from the point of view of three significant rock musicians: the Edge, Jimmy Page and Jack White.

It is just that simple and to find out why.  Simply buy the movie.

0062197266|4.0|This is a fascinating story of obsession and stalking that turns deadly.  I felt it was wonderfully written but the format was crazy. Can't image WHAT her editor was thinking of to publish the book like this.  But don't skip this book...I have a solution further on in this review!<br /><br />Every two pages (sometimes only one page) the story jumps between what happened in 2003/04 and 2007/08.  There are two big problems with this format:<br /><br />1.  It's too hard to jump back and forth between the times since the daily \\"entries\\" vary from a few paragraphs to a couple of pages.  When something happens, you have to stop and think....Is this 2003 or 2007?<br /><br />2.  The suspense (and significance of what was happening) is MUCH greater if you learn about the present day events ONLY after you know all that happened in 2003 and 2004.<br /><br />After about 25 pages, I was tempted to stop reading...but instead I came up with a solution.  From that page on, I just went through and jumped to all the 2003/04 entries and when I finished that, I went back to the beginning and read the 2007/08 entries.  This made the story much, much better. Things that happen in 2007/08 had far more significance only when knowing EVERYTHING that happened in 2003/04.<br /><br />This books should be a wake up call to anyone to run - and fast- at the very first sign of controlling, manipulating behavior.  It could save your life.
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|Describes the problem better than presenting answers. Granted, tough policy questions are raised. But the &#34;solutions&#34; read like a grab bag of possible actions that might or might not work, might or might not be politically possible.

B003PDQEBS|5.0|Every frame of this poetic movie is a painting. Artists will appreciate it especially although the storytelling will appeal across the board. It explores deep grief and despair and profound love.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The writing is crisp, the storyline engaging (though based on limited known historical records), the characters are refreshingly multidimensional and brought to life by a cadre of very talented actors.<br /><br />Watching history unfold from the perspective of these particular Viking invaders was fascinating, albeit violent and at times, stomach churning. Our present historical account is based on the records of monks and priests who were both literate as well as the frequently targeted victims.<br /><br />Clearly, the Viking perspective is speculative, as they left few records, but I found it to be believable as well as wonderfully entertaining. It was a relieve to see there wasn't an attempt to whitewash or glamorize.<br /><br />Kudos to the fine writers, excellent actors and committed directors for bringing history back to life. Double kudos for Vikings being renewed for a second season.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|To all the obsessive mega-fans who claim this is an insult to the Star Trek universe, guess what... THERE IS NO Star Trek universe. It's FICTION. It's a story, with plots and characters, locations and events-- ALL MADE UP. Sorry to shake the very foundation of your beliefs. But from the first episode of TOS, Gene Roddenberry was telling stories about truth, honor, trust, compassion, intelligence, companionship, bravery, and above all else, human emotion. We CARE about Kirk and Spock. We CARE about Scotty & Bones & all the rest. They are well-written, complex characters. The plots are (mostly) well-written, complex stories. You invest your time, and are entertained.<br /><br />This movie is exciting, emotional, passionate and you become fully invested in it-- as long as you don't compare actors who might have played a particular role previously, or worry the a character dies who never did in the older versions. Enjoy the moment - it's STAR TREK for 2013, not TOS, TNG, DS9 or any other incarnation.<br /><br />Beethoven wrote only one Symphony #9, but hundreds of orchestras have played it, recorded it, and not one interpretation is the same as any other. Into Darkness is an awesome interpretation of Roddenberry's creation.<br /><br />I've been a fan from the beginning - 1966, and I left the theater with a huge smile!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good sound from the mic instead from a camera.  Nice long cable for greater flexibility. Well constructed. Worth the money.

B002O2THRO|2.0|Robert Redford is the ideal Gatsby. But his star presence isn't enough to save this stinker. This tedious interpretation of the Fitzgerald classic is too &#34;Masterpiece Theater&#34; for its own good.  And casting Mia Farrow as the unattainable Daisy is ludicrous.

B00BGDQNLU|4.0|This movie coincided with \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" one of the most serious dramatic movies in the 1990s, and was funny, smart, and a little bizarre.  It is fun, romantic (in ways) and carries with it a very moralistic story.  (You know, for kids!)  ;-)<br /><br />What truly bothers me about this release is the audio.  It is only in DTS 2ch.  This would seem to imply that it would be the standard stereo that matches its original theatrical release.  Instead, I find myself playing \\"Up-and-down\\" with my remote when I watch it on my non-surround system.  Frustrating!!  Why did they not offer the stereo soundtrack?<br /><br />For those who do not understand this complaint, when you watch a movie with surround sound, the dialog is supposed to come out of a center channel.  The left and right front speakers will carry some of the dialog, but it's just to augment the center channel.  Those speakers are more for the music and dramatic sound effects.  Thus, when you watch it on a regular TV or on a stereo (not surround) system, you have dialog that sounds like a whisper.  So, you turn it up.  And then THE MUSIC STARTS IN, AND THE CARS BEEP, OR EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN, OR GUNS SHOOT so you turn the sound down to a manageable level.  And then all that stops, people start talking again, and they are speaking at a whisper again.  *Sigh.*  Very frustrating.<br /><br />For a movie this old, to find the Blu-ray offering only DTS sound is a little odd.<br /><br />It's still well worth owning, but you should be aware of the sound issue, and know that if you try to watch it on a non-surround system, you'll be playing yo-yo with your remote.  But hey, yo-yos are for kids, too!!  ;-)<br /><br />The video is clean, though, even if there are absolutely no extras aside from the theatrical trailer.  The main menu doesn't even give you a Chapters option!<br /><br />So, in spite of this being one of my favorite movies, I can't give this release five stars.  It would be nice if they would re-release this movie some day with better options and maybe some extras.se this movie some day with better options and maybe some extras.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I love this series. I think it is witty and very true to how I felt in my life. I wish they had shows like now.
0399162097|5.0|Begin in the middle. Rosemary, the narrator of this engaging novel, was an overly garrulous child, and received this advice back when everyone was trying to shut her up. Hence, our acquaintance with her begins in 1996, during her fifth year at UC Davis. Witnessing a loud and messy breakup in the dining hall, Rosemary is fascinated by the impulsive young woman who ultimately draws her in to the scene. They go to jail together and begin a strange friendship --- if you can be friends with someone named Harlow who talks her way into your apartment while you're not there and drinks your beer.<br /><br />From jail, Rosemary calls her father, and we begin to see some of the contours of the family dynamic. \\"Because of who he was, a professional man used to having his own way, my father managed to get the arresting officer on the phone. Officer Haddick had children of his own: he treated my father with all the sympathy my father felt he deserved. Soon they were calling each other Vince and Arnie, and the assault charge had been reduced to interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duty and soon after that it was dropped altogether.\\" Rosemary agrees to discuss it all thoroughly with her parents at Thanksgiving back in Bloomington, Indiana.<br /><br />The family Thanksgiving meal is a standard fictional trope for good reason. What other occasion is so rife with comic material? Karen Joy Fowler exploits it adroitly, and further establishes the intimacy we feel with her. \\"My father made a crude joke. He made the same joke or some variation of it every time Bob gave him the opening, which was every other year. If the joke were witty, I'd include it, but it wasn't. You'd think less of him and thinking less of him is my job, not yours. The silence that followed was filled with pity for my mother, who could have married Will Barker if she hadn't lost her mind and chosen my father, a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, fly-fishing atheist from Indianapolis, instead.\\"<br /><br />But beneath the comic surface of part one, Rosemary dances around the long absences of her older brother, Lowell, and a sister named Fern, who, we discover on page 77, is a chimpanzee. (I thought long and hard about revealing this, but observant readers will notice the tiny chimp hanging from a huge tree on the cover.) In part two, we go back to the beginning, to when Rosemary was five and shuttled off to her grandparents' house for a couple of weeks while her mom recovered and her family moved to a new house. When she got to the new house, Fern was gone. Where she went and why is the puzzle that defines Rosemary's life. Along the way, the puzzle pieces illuminate the nature of memory and of family. The prose remains funny and honest, and entirely suited to the telling of what is, in many ways, a tragedy.<br /><br />WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES takes us back to UC Davis in 1996, where Lowell finds his little sister after an absence of 10 years, and finally forward to 2012. \\"An election year in the U.S., as if you needed to be reminded, the vituperative tunes of the Ayn Rand Marching Band bleating from the airwaves.\\" Every human family member's choices are influenced by the time with Fern, and while this compelling novel provides closure about the characters, the uncomfortable realities of the costs of experimenting on animals will remain with readers for some time to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman Nicol
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been quite a while since  I have found science fiction that I  enjoyed so much. A very different life-after-the-holocaust type of story, Howey has built a hyper-organized world, filled with secrets and taboos.<br /><br />The story maintains a fast pace of action, human drama and insightful depictions what is not always attractive human behavior. It was difficult to put down.<br /><br />I found the characters likeable, if under developed. But they were fleshed out enough to do a great job of keeping the story moving along at an exciting clip.<br /><br />I enjoyed the unpredictable plot and look forward to the \\"Shift\\" series. I will be recommending this book to my sci-fi fan friends.<br /><br />And thank you Hugh Howey for putting these together in one book so I didn't have to pause between the exciting parts.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The Lincoln movie was a good movie and I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about history during Lincoln's term as President.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  I know that this is her favorite movie!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I bought this book to read while on exercise equipment and it made the time go by so much faster.  The author keeps your attention and wanting to read 'just one more page'.  The story, written from a young girl's viewpoint, follows the lives of her family and the hardships they endure and how they manage to get through them.<br />I will look for other books by this author!
B007QJBHRS|1.0|Top Class Actors. Wonderfully written movie. A must see. But the video quality on the Amazon Instant Video version is horrible. Look's like someone copied it from a VHS. I tried watching it 4 times already hoping it was a server problem and it would correct itself. Very disappointed with Amazon.Com. I can't return it. Wasted $10.00. Get the DVD version from Netflix and enjoy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I don't get into programs like this...don't dig the 'gay' stuff, but overall, the characters are entertaining, costumes are devine.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|My all time favorite Cary grant film. Alfred Hitchcock directing is superb. The Technicolor video transfers perfectly to HD. The supporting cast is wonderful. Great writting. Rent it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. My husband and I made it a point o discuss each chapter. We learned so much about each other. Thanks for such a great read!!!!
B009PAETCG|5.0|Very good game a must if you like soccer always a good game if you need something to pass the time
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle because my son is addicted to it. It just made sense to add it to another device. All in all, the app work great, im happy with it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's hard to tell whether this book was so easy to read because it was written geniously simply or it was because I partially get it what he's going through. Amazing! Recommend it to anyone who's looking for a book that would be easy to read yet still would have a deep meaning.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie took on the main themes and messages from the novel and translated it to the screen with minor changes. Imagery was beautiful and had an otherworldly quality that gave the film a new dimension.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book in this series. I hope there will be more to follow. If you liked fifty shades you will like this series
B009CG2YDE|5.0|The app is very addictive and challenging at times, but that adds to the fun. Although I do have a couple things I think would make it better, How about a bigger health bar? And maybe some story on how velocispider came to be? And at last, How about the first level be the tutorial because mist people don't go to the area where you learn how to play.<br /><br />That's all, and overall it's a great game. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This is a story about the Lincoln lawyer (the automobile, not the 19th century president), Mickey Haller, defending a young, wealthy but evil man from an evil family against charges that he beat up a high-money party girl. As Haller and his investigative team dig deep they find their client might not be the lily white poor little rich boy they had been led to believe. The middle part of the story drags a bit but catches fire toward the end. The exciting legal protocols might just be the best Connelly has written. Even if you're an anti-lawyer person, Connelly does a masterful job of roping you in with Haller's enticing courtroom actions. The last half of this novel will keep you up long past your bedtime. Strongly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that because now I can play minecraft on the go cause my mom won't let me take her laptop in the car:-)
B006C1DH92|4.0|The original is a good way to pass the time and to have Puss in Boots as the theme makes this game even more entertaining. Good for all ages and any where you happen to have some time to slice fruit.
1423140591|5.0|Percy is back and better than ever. He is still the boy we all know, and love, but he has lost his memory of camp half-blood. This action packed adventure leads us on a journey with knew characters to love and a way for Percy to get back to Annabeth. These 3 heroes come together and try and figure out what Gaea is planning to do. The sequel will have you flipping pages. You won't want to put it down. Read It!
1878424319|4.0|PROS:  this book is not for the closed minded person.  I absolutely love Miguels teachings.  They are tremendous principles to live by and even though Miguel does not refer to God's Word we can definitely find the principles there.<br />CONS:  it is &#34;wordy&#34; and difficult to comprehend.  I suggest purchasing a &#34;quicklet&#34; or mini version instead.
B004CURZFC|4.0|Film looks amazing on digital -- probably even better on Blu-ray when it arrives. Not sure why this tanked at the box office but probably can be summed up as: People love cute Penguins; Owls, not so much.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My boyfriend and I watch The Walking Dead together. We watched 1 & 2 on Netflix and we had to buy season 3 on Amazon. We are hooked to the drama of this show and cannot wait for Season 4!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I like this game. My son really enjoyed playing it. He can't wait for more levels. It was lots of fun.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is a fresh, clean-cut Englishman who plays Abraham Lincoln. From what I read, he read many interpretations of Lincoln's voice to know how to talk and act like Lincoln. This movie is very accurate to the history of Lincoln. Everyone in this movie looks and resembles all of the historical characters. Great plot, and story line.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked! Could not wait for this to come out. Loved it! Come on season four! I can't wait
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was an amazing Tarintino movie that showed a different outlook of slavery. Jamie Foxx plays a bounty hunter, while looking for his enslaved wife who is a slave for a businessman played by Dicaprio. Great plot and story! Worth the watch.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I don't buy or own a lot of music. I bought this along with the Some Nights CD by Fun. I love both of these CD's and would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice beat playing in the background.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone it will assist you with your life experiences! It also gives you food for thought!!!
B009NPA3MS|3.0|I heard one of Phillip Phillips songs on the radio that I liked so I bought the CD. Apparently the song on the radio is the only one that I actually liked.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book was really good. It held my interest and the writing was great. This one sort of lost me towards the end. I felt like their story was being tied together too quickly and Ana seemed so needy and naive. You sort of step into reason and you're like &#34;these people need to get to know each other better.&#34; Idk, that's what I got from it. Still, it's steamy scenes are extra steamy (wait till you get to the ball) and Christian's just as domineering as ever.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I don't buy a lot of music. My husband and daughters were surprised that I had even heard of Fun and that I bought the CD.<br />Everyone has asked to borrow it. I like the peppy beat to the songs.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot - a good distraction and enjoyable.  Hoping to have time to distract myself with the continuation soon.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|should be able to get diamonds easier. kinds gets annoying that there is a limit to energy and there should be more competitions
B001N3GUIE|4.0|This is the one scifi movie that started it all, by 1956 standards the special effects were state of the art. The only effects better were done by Disney. I first saw this movie when I was 9 or 10 and never forgot it. Thank You!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i would recommend this game to people who like temple run. Its a really fun game. Also its really addicting
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I like the humor of the doctor an Billie Piper is sexy. I strongly recommend this how for everyone that likes sci fi.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, which is really the only qualification I have for a great book. :)  It entertains, is a very quick read, and even though it fits in the Sci-Fi category, I really don't think it's limited to just that category.  I recommend the first book in this quintet, for sure, as does my husband, who read it right after me!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a fun game for my son to play. After the movie he just wanted to play it and now he does.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|For Trekkies and Trekkers with any sense of humor, this is a must read. Loving in a derisively humorous way. This delivers big time laughs and huge smiles of recognition of all things Star Trek. It reminds me of those episodes of Stargate where SG1 is entangled in the TV show Wormhole X-Treme! It is highly reminiscent also of Scalzi's previous &#34;Agent to the Stars&#34; More of a comedy with some fun playing of Sc-Fi conventions. It takes the Observer Effect from Quantum Physics to new (lower) levels and explores the fourth wall (and the fifth). For Scalzi's &#34;Old Man's War&#34; fans, this should be noted it is NOT really Sci-Fi in the Hard, or Military, or Philosophical vein. This is Sci-Fi more like Barbarella is Sci-Fi, though MUCH better than Barbarella.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game! Must get it......i do enjoy playing it if i must say. I easily rate it five  stars without a doubt.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This is the funnest and funniest of all the Barrayar tales. Making a star out of our long standing second banana. I was so impressed I re-read a bunch of the older novels, just the see how my new found love of Ivan changed the narrative. Happy endings in the best traditions, with smiles at the interactions of secondary Barrayar characters and new additions to Bujold's Universe. I would suggest this is best read after at least having read a few of the Miles Vorkosigan novels. But it could be my favorite of all the Barrayar tales. Definitely more in the nature of &#34;A Civil Campaign&#34; than the earlier Vorkisigan tales.
B00594XOZU|2.0|It keeps saying that it has stopped working. I don't want to delete it and lose my messages that I just got and can't read because the app won't open! FIX THIS ASAP!
1451688091|5.0|I loved this book. I was transported back in time. Through Ms. Goodwin's writing, I experienced Lincoln not as a remote historical figure, but as an amazing person who understood human nature and cared deeply for his country, family, friends, and countrymen. This is a great book about leadership and humility. This is nonfiction at its finest!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is about the best Slender game you can get on tablet. I really love it and tend to play it often. It's a good game to give you a chill and not to scary for kids. The best slendy game on tablet. I recommend this game to everyone. Slenderman is watching but has no eyes! So how is he watching you?!?! (DONUT EYES!!) Have fun with your Slendy game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was good, my criticisms aren't significant and wouldn't resonate with the public.  Highly recommended for teenagers, but not as much for adults.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fast, easy and comfortable. Its always good to have a caculater in your tablet, so I highly recommend this app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Sweet game.The update is really fun. But there should be a finish line after awhile of running. Otherwise sweet game. GET IT!
B004ZJZQBK|4.0|**Blu Ray<br /><br />I actually got a chance to catch this flick when it hit theaters. The selling point for me in this movie was Morgan Freeman. He's been excellent in pretty much every film he's done so I had no doubt he would shine here. While I won't say it's his worst performance, he has had far better roles in the Batman films and in Driving Ms Daisy, Glory, and Million Dollar Baby. It felt like this role was sort of a throwaway for him. Perhaps he read the script and thought \\"Why not just do a fun one.\\"<br /><br />James McAvoy was alright, but as with Morgan this was not his best. Some of the action he was in was pretty out there so if anything, most of his role got lost in it. Angelina Jolie was alright, playing a role we've seen her play before as a tough girl with a heart. Her character development flopped to me, again feeling as if it took a backseat to the action.<br /><br />*****Possible Spoiler******<br /><br />Still, she has one very funny scene where she rolls up to another car as her corvette is falling to pieces. She offers a smile and drives on, flat tires and all.<br /><br />The supporting characters all have interesting nicknames which kind of get explained, but not really. The core of this movie is in its action sequences. As I stated in the title, if you come into this without suspending disbelief, you may not enjoy it. There are car flips, Angelina shows us an interesting way to pick someone up in her car, there are curving bullets, bullets that crash into each other, and trains that plummets from what looks like at least 200 feet. The action keeps you interested as you start trying to figure out what other interesting, oddball methods they may use to try and knock someone off.<br /><br />An interesting action ride with a sort of interesting plot. If you are in this for character development, you might be disappointed. If you are here for a fun romp through the action zone, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />The blu ray transfer is pretty good. The colors are rich and the sound isn't low when dialog is spoken like some other films are. I was able to pick this movie up for about $7 while on sale.<br /><br />3.6 / 5colors are rich and the sound isn't low when dialog is spoken like some other films are. I was able to pick this movie up for about $7 while on sale.<br /><br />3.6 / 5
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To me this story helps me see my life as a movie, a story outside myself.  We are all the Game Maker and the Tribute! It's a metaphor for life.  Obstacles will always be thrown in our path, just to see what we'll do, how we'll handle it.  Just got to remember why we create such challenges for ourselves.
B001794FOK|3.0|I found the idea of someone being able to jump from place to place just by picturing it in their mind fascinating. I admit I'm not a fan of Hayden Christensen after the job he did in the Star Wars movies, but I felt he was pretty good in the film Shattered Glass so I gave this film a try. I looked at the cast they put around him and I felt that this really could have worked, but it felt a little flat.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is is great as he always is. I liked him as the pseudo bad guy who hunts down the \\"Jumpers.\\" Rachel Bilson was cute and likeable, but there were a couple of scenes where she looked like a deer in headlights. Hayden gave an alright performance, but nowhere near as good as in Shattered Glass. I know his character is supposed to be a little pompous, but it came across badly on screen. Diane Lane...oh, boy. This film could have definitely benefitted from more of her. It felt like there was probably more material with her in it, but for some reason it was cut from the finish product. If I remember correctly, the movie clocked in at under 90 minutes so I don't see why we couldn't have had a little more of Diane. In fact, when it was all said and done, it felt like the movie was shorter than it had originally intended to be which is probably why I was left unfulfilled. In the end, I felt as if I were rushed into my seat only to be told to get the heck out of the theater right as the ending came. Sorry, dear Jumper. You were kind of fun, but I never even got a chance to know you.<br /><br />An alright movie with a great idea that probably should have been done a little better.<br /><br />3 / 5
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|A must have for every Iron Maiden fan! Great tour, great set-list, great performance! Plus, it contains previously unreleased tracks! You will not make a mistake if You buy it!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Best show on TV! I've seen all 6 seasons and I hope they never cancel it! Cracks me up every episode.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've had this game on my s3 since it came out over a year, and I still play it almost every day, and have been waiting for it to come out on the kindle, it's my favorite game still, everyone should have it.
0316023744|3.0|By Beevor's own admission, the Second World War is one of the most written-about events in history. This book is Beevor's own admission to that collection of single-volume histories on the subject: Beevor notes in the book that it was written in many ways to fill gaps in his own knowledge and expertise on the war (he has written a number of works on individual campaigns and battles, including Stalingrad, Normandy and the Battle of Berlin).<br /><br />On the positive side: he has attempted to approach the war with a relatively fresh scope, giving much greater weight to the war in China than usually has been done in such histories. In addition to using his personal work on the Eastern Front, he has also touched on themes explored in more detail by such contemporary historians as Timothy Snyder on the complex love-hate interplay of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. The book does much to discuss the positives and negatives of all combatants in the war, and does much to dispel the myth of the \\"Good War\\" (although spoiler alert: the Western democracies were still a better bet than anyone else in the war, as far as humanitarianism goes).<br /><br />On the negative side: as other reviewers have noted, a major problem of this book is the level of detail. One gets an exceptionally high level of detail in the discussions of battles and campaigns that Beevor has personally done major research and writing on: the Battle of France, Stalingrad, Normandy, and Berlin. Often this focus is down to a divisional level.  However, Beevor's non-specialist areas of the war tend to get much shorter shrift, and his British-based viewpoint seems to further aggravate this lopsided viewpoint: the use of the atomic bomb merits  less page space than the British reoccupation of Hong Kong in 1945, for example, and both together take up far less space than Hitler's last days.  Naval campaigns also tend to get breezed-through very quickly.<br /><br />While the discussions of personalities and rivalries and international politics are detailed, they often feel muddled: the same international conference can get mentioned different times with hundreds of pages in between, without a clear indication that it is the same event being discussed.  The biographical and personal details on key leaders and strategists like Roosevelt, Marshall and Truman feel weak: they make their appearance only to describe Allied failures in strategy (especially around Poland), and then disappear. Even military leaders seem to mostly get mentioned in order to describe their shortcomings (Air Marshal Arthur Harris comes in for a lot of criticism for example, but with only a partial explanation of why he was so driven to promote strategic bombing). Beevor  in my opinion paints  Eisenhower in a surprisingly excessive negative light, especially in his decision to not march on Berlin, but without a very good argument on what Beevor sees as better, unpursued alternatives.  Perhaps Beevor is too much of a professional military man to handle the political side of the war? Much of the military aspects of the war have hundreds, if not thousands of books and documentaries about them at this point: for a single volume work it would seem that at least a little more politics and more economics would have been helpful to counterpoint the military aspects of the war one reads very little on how combatants' war industries kept their militaries supplied during this conflict.<br /><br />Another disappointment was the Beevor tried to walk us through too much of the campaigns and the war itself, but devoted very little to its effects both on postwar politics and conflicts, but also to the historiography and cultural effects of the war. His afterword hinted at some very interesting ideas and discussions that Beevor could have had on this subject, but which again he only mentions in passing. I would have loved to read more of his thoughts on these subjects.<br /><br />Sometimes Beevor's prose can feel a bit repetitive: he seems to be quite taken with the image of people being run over by tanks, because this detail tends to get worked in to almost every battle and campaign discussed.<br /><br />A final complaint: the maps. Some of the maps had inaccuracies on them, but in general there were just too few, with too little detail to provide a visual tool to follow the more detailed aspects of the campaigns described, especially in China and on the Eastern Front. I mostly had to rely on John Keegan's (a mentor of Beevor) edited \\"Atlas of the Second World War\\" to remedy this.
0307891402|5.0|Even though I never received this book from Amazon itself, I picked it up through Barnes & Noble and I am super glad I did. It's full of great tips for building a durable character and has everything you need to know to help you through the game
1455519006|3.0|THE STORY WAS UNBELIEVABLE AS MOST NOVELS ARE, BUT IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND EASY READING. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND IT
B006O99SYA|4.0|If you enjoy reading about history as it impacted on individuals who lived through it, this is a wonderful read. Paul French made the personalities of the people involved so believable, even though built from his research, that it was easy to see how events could have unfolded. I read this just before a visit to Beijing and found myself trying to find all the locations mentioned when I was there. It was a hard to imagine that I was in the same city. A sad story but respectfully told.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|WORKING OUT FINE, COULDN'T BEAT THE PRICE. AMAZON SENT ME THIS CABLE AT NO CHARGE. I AM GRATEFUL, NOT ONLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE BUT FOR AMAZON AS A WHOLE, I FIND AMAZON TO EASY TO DEAL WITH AND A GREAT SOURCE FOR BOOKS  ENTERTAINMENT
B000Q79HS8|4.0|In this second movie of the Jason Bourne series, I Love the car chases, the man hunts, the fight scenes, the suspense, but I'll have to say that the 3rd movie is my favorite of the whole Jason Bourne series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|ENJOYED IT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SEASON. VERY INTERESTING, INSIGHT INTO BRITSH CULTURE IN THE EARLY 18TH CENTURY

B0054SMID0|3.0|Looking at Matthew McConaughy was 5 stars but the book was SO much better than the movie!!! Read the book.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A great drama written story about intrigue and murder. I have added this to my list of books I would read more than once
B004TI1WME|3.0|Too labor intensive for me.  Have to press keys several times before calculator enters the value.  The concept is a good one, just not into working my butt off getting the keyed in digits accepted.
B000SW2F8K|3.0|A good entertainment, nothing else. Do not expect a spectacular movie, but at least you will keep watching till the very end
193700788X|3.0|3 stars or maybe 3 1/2 stars. This was not the ending I expected but I understand. I understand what Sookie wasn't willing to give up. i get it. I also understand why so many fans are upset. they went through years involved with Sookies relationship only to have it end abruptly. Im trying not to give away to many details with my review. I did think the fake murder charges were kinda lame but I liked all the twist it took. plus this being the final book, you got to revisit all of the previous characters that made up Sookie's world. it felt like a lil bow was tied up for the fans to unwrap. Anyways, im still sad its over. Goodbye Sookie.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book brings you face to face with Adam Brown, a follower of Jesus and a great American warrior. Brown gave his life in service to our great nation, and his story is one of the most inspirational I have ever read. Great book. An even better man.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I don't have much else to say. This app is great. I got it ages ago as the free app of the day. But it's worth paying for. I've checked out many other weather apps since, and this is by far the best.
B001QU4ZVS|5.0|Simply wonderful, dynamic selection.  Brings back memories of the jazz of old from a new artist.  Could not be better.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I got this book because Im a Eagles fan from Philly and I kept hearing good things about the movie. It took me a while to actually start reading it but once I did I could not stop! This book is awesome! I felt kind of bad for Pat initially but was happy to see him get his very own silver lining in the end!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a really good game! at first I thought it would be boring and not fun but I really love it! I also got airport city after I got this but that game is nothing compared to this! when you first get it it looks boring or hats but once you play it for like 10 minutes it gets fun! that's is just my opinion! get the game!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  The book was informative and breath taking.  I have now made the choice to follow this practical guide to personal freedom!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy winning the different prizes and getting big coins.  I won many coins and have a great deal of fun.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This movie is funny and dramatic. A story with a lot of twists and good actors. I am relatively new to foreign films, but I could follow along easily with subtitles.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|The Beach Boys have pulled off a masterful stroke with this high quality CD from their 2012 tour.  my son and daughter took me to the Concert at Meriweather.  Whether you attended the tour or not, if you're a Beach Boys fan (or have one in your family) this CD is wonderful.  The original Beach Boys who are still alive are backed by a few other vocalists and a crisp sounding band making the group come alive yet again.  50 years!  Enjoy.  The price is also a steal.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|There are very very few movies that can keep you engaged with only two actors talking, Richard Linklater triology are definitely one of those. Excellent conversations enacted by superb acting. Haven't enjoyed a movie this much for a while.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator. It is simple in design and as easy to use as a traditional one.  One great thing about it is that the advertisements are so discreet that they are barely noticeable.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was great! I have been in the social work field for 6 years, and found this book to be amazingly accurate on what a child goes through growing up in the system. It is accurate on how a social worker responds, and really gives a glimpse into what our kids go through if they don't have a loving family to help raise them. In this case, there is a happy ending, and that's great! Not enough happy endings for our foster babies out there....
1452115567|5.0|This book is beautifully done, with gorgeous photos of Maddie. Love it! Would make a great gift or coffee table book.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|My wife and I both completed the first level set of games fairly quickly and easily.  At the end, it asked if I wanted to continue at the expert level and I replied &#34;yes&#34;.  That went fairly well until achieving the last door to explore, then after the second step of that level I have been stuck.  the required scores are so High it seems almost impossible to complete.  Yet, I remember at the basic level I was achieving scores much higher than those now required and I can't figure out what is different.  A real Challenge at this point.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book took you down into your soul. It is very timely( a coincidence?). My grandaughter had recommended it. At Times riveting, while disturbing. The poor little girl. How could parents be so blinded! I think it should be required reading for all who consider themselves &#34;human.&#34;
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|There are many levels in the game but it is fairly easy to master.  Keeps your attention and provides a goal to achieve to maintain your interest.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My granddaughter recommended the book to me as &#34;something different&#34; and it was. It was fascinating reading. it<br />gave me some issues to ponder.  Could this EVER be real? This is my first book of Card's. Laura tells me &#34;Ender's Game&#34; will be in the movie form soon.

B005S9EKCW|1.0|I'm sorry folks but I can't recommend this movie to anyone except those who are looking to be depressed. With in the first 15 mins Jackman is beaten and subjected to a life of probation, Hathaway is fired for being cute with child, then has her teeth pulled out for money, the chopped off hair for money and that was 15 mins into the movie.<br /><br />This is no chick flick, its DEPRESSING!!!! can't wait to sell it on EBAY.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was the best  book that I had read. Can't wait for . The<br />.movie to come out in August. My favorite character of the book is.  Jace
1616551151|5.0|I bought this book because I love the series, so I was excited that they made an art book for it. It's got about 200+ pages, and it's BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY WAY. Perfect for anyone who loves the Dragon Age series. It delves into the universe lore, and has character, and monster concept art. Wonderful quality pages, and the price is amazing compared to it's original price. (Around $40 or more if you buy it at a book store!) Can't wait for the next volume!
B00AB2DNBU|5.0|loved this special edition uk stealbox cover bluray!! has a lot of special feat from the movie!! evil dead all the way!!! playes on my region 1 bluray player!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a very good book! If I were you I would read this! Good book for kids. Totally worth it!!!
B004FGMV0W|2.0|...I still insist this album is the weakest thing in her career.  Most of Avril's music has been a cross between Alanis Morissette and Blink 182, but this album sounds like Blink 182 on sedatives crossed with throwaways from Alanis's SO-CALLED CHAOS.  THE BEST DAMN THING wasn't brimming with substance, and was really \\"just\\" a pop-album with no introspective qualities, but at least it wasn't boring like this one is.  Standout songs are \\"Not Enough\\" and \\"What The Hell\\".  The rest of the songs range from forgettable to mediocre.  If you're a die-hard Avril fan, you'll enjoy her \\"invitation to her diary\\" approach of the songwriting and lyrics, but for the 8 million people who bought and enjoyed LET GO simply because it was a freakin' great album, they have good reason to have held off on buying this album.

014312336X|4.0|A fascinating book which depicts Peking just before the Japanese invaded China at the beginning of WW II. The author does a great job of history, detective work, and prose.  I highly recommend this as a good read and a true crime story.<br /><br />a
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|lots of fun. great for free. play it more than any other game I have. excellent lots of fun. wonderful
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Great  movie, but read the book also. the historical accuracy in this movie is about 85 percent and the visual and dramatic layering by spike lee makes it all come to life.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Absolutely stunning! The detail is unmatched! I look forward to the many great books me publishes! His many books will inspire young readers to write their own!
0071390111|5.0|When they illustrate neurons with empty outlines and maybe throw in a nucleus, they are leaving out most of the fascinating details of how neurons actually work. Those details can be found here!<br />I just finished my undergrad in cell bio/biotech and hope to go to grad school in a field involving neural science, so I bought this book to get a head start. Now I wish I'd bought it earlier in my undergrad career, as I find learning details helps with retaining information.<br />For a textbook of this size and with this much information, it is quite reasonably priced. I think splitting it into two volumes would have been a wise move, as you can't really lie down and read it without being crushed by its weight.
B00821OX98|5.0|Finally got to watch this series.  Missed it when it was on tv.  Totally loved it and being able to watch it in HD was fantastic.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|tacks for ever to lode.it is hard and not vere cool to see<br />the dinosaur.they don't move allot.such anemashen<br />the end
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Good movie for children, easy to follow and enjoy.  he grandchildren enjoyed on vacation.  Love Johnny Depp in this production.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Very good app. In my opinion it is easy to use and easy to understand . I like this app. OK
B008CLI4N4|5.0|good service, loved it
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Very interesting story line, and fast past.. Can not wait until the next one in the series comes out . Good read
B004DLPXAO|4.0|So far, I love it. It fits my desire to have as little with me as possible, with as much robust potential for use as possible. As I now carry my tablet with me when traveling, visiting my grandchildren, waiting for doctor appointments and soon in my office to easily take patient notes, I am thrilled to have recent Kindle purchases with me.  It's a secret pleasure to be able to read a few pages or a chapter &#34;on the fly&#34;.  Gosh, I Love Technology!
B008L1DNGI|3.0|This was an Amazon free app of the day a while back, and it's alright. I played it for a while on my Kindle and then put it down. It'll waste a little time and make you think a bit but nothing special here.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I checked this out from the library, hoping to learn more about hiking.  That the notation on the cover indicated self discovery was to be a plus.  I found no real evidence of either.  That an author can write a best seller about not hiking a trail completely and not be able to present what internal changes took place as a result and instead shows herself more to be self focused than reflective and that most of the reviews presented are favorable tells me how badly we want enlightenment as long as we don't have to change.<br /><br />I doubt this would have been a bestseller without the almighty Ophrah's seal of approval.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This book was chosen by my Book Club.  It is a very interesting story of the class system in India.  It is a story of a baby girl born in the slums of India and adopted by a well-to-do couple in the United States.  It was shocking to know the worth of a girl baby versus a boy baby.  This book was liked by most of the members of our group. A few thought it was contrived but most of us enjoyed reading the book and reading about the author's country and its customs. I would recommend this book.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so fun but when you play use the clues it is kinda weird when you type Kid and a donkey appears
B000NY12LO|3.0|I appreciate the depth of research put into Nineteen Minutes. It's a compelling look into a difficult subject with complex, realistic characters and a brilliant portrayal of abusive romantic love. Ms Picoult makes one flawed assumption, though: that all teenagers want to fit in. However, this is a small issue. A larger issue for me was the length (I appreciate that this s a mother's tale of angst, but there was 100 pages too much of it) and the ending, which I found unsatisfying because I'd figured it out the big twist 1/8 of the way in, and because the trial ends right when it should actually begin! I won't say more to keep from revealing any spoilers, except that the 'surprise'  would actually have shifted the outcome of the case considerably, so I find it odd that the story ended at its most crucial scene. It's almost as though Ms Picoult got sick of dealing with the procedural aspects once the various mothers' emotional journeys were no longer front and centre. Still, the book is worth reading for its core message -- especially if you have teens and guns in your house!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The comparison to the Fifty Shades trilogy is undeniable...in some parts the plot is exactly the same. However I enjoy the main female character more than Ana so this series is enjoyable. Its a little more rough around the edges as far as language but overall its is a great series.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|this movie sucks if you like the idea behind it. skip this hack job of a movie and read the books.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Denzel Washington proving, once again, how powerful an actor he is.  To date, the only person who has overcome the &#34;Ryan Reynolds effect&#34; in anything other than a feather weight comedy!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I like the fact that it's science fiction and a little science fact.<br />It helps me to think outside the box. I wish that Syfy would come up with some more shows like what they've had in the past.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|some bloody, squirting scenes, but composition of the story is excellent and in the tradition of the classic spaghetti western.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Great graphics. Just wish they put a cockpit view.But good game to kill some time and see planes from the past
B002LANLDK|3.0|These movies (under direction from Lin) have consistently improved from project to project.  These movies need the Vin Deisel's character.  It is not as effective without it.
B002436WFI|5.0|Big Terry Pratchett fan, and loved this.  Usually disappointed by favorite novels turned into movies, even allowing for some necessary trimming of the novel to a shorter format.  Not so here.  Especially fond of my favorite character--the luggage!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|excellent performances all around, but it is hard to see watch human being crumble.  Reminded me of &#34;Days of Wine and Roses&#34;.
B00ABO573A|2.0|Rather flabby would-be examination of a troubled long-term relationship, characterized by one member's ongoing refusal to simply move on and stop being a human doormat to a crackhead.  Remarkably uninvolving on pretty much every level.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Character development was weak, but I was not surprised.  Very few appear to be able to write a credible, multi-faceted african american male character.  I guess no one cares about male african american characters enough to portray them beyond stale, cardboard, stereotypical re-hashes.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Manipulative claptrap. I hated this book. Simply dreadful. It took me three tries to finally finish it and I did it only because a friend asked me to.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|An excellent interpretation with better than excellent execution.  It does give me pause, however, why there is constantly a need to sheer off so far from the original content that has stood the test of time for over fifty years.<br />Daredevil comes to mind as an example.  Also, if anyone at Disney is noticing, the more true you are the Hulk character, the more popular the character becomes.  Hulk character is a &#34;horror&#34; story, make it violent like the second movie, and show the true terror of implied power (showing some consequences on non-military personel) and you will capture what made this character survive through the years.
0765334798|3.0|By the time I was about 100 pages in, I was thinking, \\"meh.\\" The idea of the redshirts and their circumstances aboard the Intrepid sounded engaging, but Scalzi's execution was rather thin. There are hilarious segments in the second half, but they're not nearly enough of a payoff. I couldn't think of a single geek friend I'd recommend it to.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|well written, as exemplified by the extensive library based on this character (based on marketing insert in the DVD case).  I am unfamiliar with the character, but, like with all Cruise endeavors, extremely well executed.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a quick yet informative read that provided real-life examples. I liked the useful explanations of human behavior that accompanied the examples. I appreciated the summary and exercises at the end.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|These movies (under direction from Lin) have consistently improved from project to project. Inclusion of Dwayne Jaohnson gives Deisel a worthy antagonist.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Rewatched this movie after many years.  Found it to be entertaining.  Enjoyed the plotline and the humor throughout.  Did wonder how they knew they could go back in time, but just watched &#34;The Naked Time&#34; in the original series and now I understand.  best watched together after movies 2 & 3.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|love love love this new quell game!!! new challenges new puzzles new adventures the graphics are great love the music cant put it down!!! I am obsessed with solving each puzzle in the least number of moves!!! best Quell yet!!! Keep them coming fallin tree!!!
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|Good deal for Robert fans, Not only a good album but the price was good and the packaging was proffesonal, I would recommend to any fans of the Tall Cool One.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|Spaghetti without tomato sauce sucks!!  Let the Italians keep their<br />movies.  They try to be so realistic that it becomes unrealistic.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this app is so fun it creates whatever u type it is one of my favorite apps u should get this app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this is a FANTASTIC game because it's got a wonderful new edition with the keys but I think that it will be better if you can use your own coins to pay for the keys. : ) : ) : ) : ) :) : ) : )
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is not too bad on my kindle fire HD, however pictures that have been posted do not appear when you choose to view a comment later via notifications. Finding people seems to be impossible via the app. Also when you want to view likes, it shows select names but not all who have liked a post...?
B00992CF6W|3.0|Can't figure out how to use my craft boxes. Like pc version better.  If there is a way to use it then somehow let me know.
B00005LK94|4.0|Great fictional story built around factual programs in which ultralight aricraft are used to teach endangered species to migrate to bring back their numbers.  Cute girl, good family story, resolution of conflicts without being too intense or too sappy.  In fact it is enjoyable enough to forgive a couple of really trite and ludicrous scenes, such as managing to land at an air force base before jets can be scrambled to intercept and being chewed out by a very loud general who didn't really mean it.  If the rest of the movie hadn't been so enjoyable, I would have cringed.  Also watched the special documentary on the same DVD describing the actual program the movie is based on.  Definitely family fare, and super for anyone who enjoys ultralights.  (Note:  The specific two-seater the little girl flies is made in Australia and costs about US$50,000, which is almost ten times the cost of the average ultralight manufactured in the U.S.)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is great it must be one of the best iron man games out there I just cant stop
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book follows Ender's Game beautifully.  It is so rich with emotion and truth.  A &#34;must read&#34; for sure.  You will fall in love with Ender all over again.
B003J4MAAC|3.0|Sometimes I cannot remember one Dirty Harry movie from another.  I remember watching both and I think this was a little on the weaker side than just the Dirty Harry movie.  A vicarious thrill.  Eastwood's just plane likable.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This film was recommended to me by a friend and I am so happy I watched it. It shows, in full detail, the life of an amazing musician and human rights advocate that many people overlook. There were great interviews, great cinematography, and a wealth of musical knowledge that was riveting for a music lover like me.
B0056JJY2K|5.0|New settlers are trying to build a new homsteds and a town.  The town is controlled by cattle ranchers who want the settlers land for their own.  Shane, a gunfighter with a mild personality, is asked to stay with a family who had a son called Joey.  Joey has alot of affection for shane and even tells his mother he likes shane almost as much as his dad.<br />There finally comes a showdown in town.  Shane goes alone, at least he thinks he's alone but Joey is following close behind.  The ranchers in town have hired a gunfighter (one of Jack Palances well know early roles).  Shane heard about him while at the family he's staying with.  He knew there would be trouble. The show down comes when Shane goes into town.  He challanges Wilson (Jack Palance), and kills him along with a few others in the bar who are against the settlers.  Shane is about to leave the bar when Joey yells, &#34;look out shane&#34;). There was the big boss of these cattle people, with a shot gun. Shane turns around and shoots him. He leaves the bar slightly wounded with Joey crying out,&#34;I love you Shane:&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I wanted to love this based on other's reviews but I found it predictable. Landay's writing is average but not stellar. Charcter development was spoonfed and weak. However, a fast beach read.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I'm a big John Fogerty fan, and this new album is a welcome treat. The collaberations are terrific! I love every track, and if you also like John Fogerty, I highly recommend this!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of Bones, The Mortal Instruments #1 by Cassandra Clare 4 stars<br /><br />Very good!  It's always a treat when an author takes the same old urban fantasy idea and twists it into a brand new story. Clary is just a normal teenager until she can suddenly see a group of Shadowhunters chasing and murdering a demon.  The plot takes a rapid turn into a world where demons, vampires, werewolves and fairies are not just real but not like any other urban fantasy book you've read, and that's not even the best part of the book.<br /><br />There are two very interesting subplots involving the main characters, romance and family dynamics.  The way<br />the author handled the situations was very well written.  She left the door open to take the subjects up in the<br />next book and I can't wait to see what happens next!<br /><br />I was hesitant to read this book because of it's YA label and upcoming movie release-I was wrong.  It does have a healthy dose of the required teenage angst and melodrama, but it's very easy to skim over and doesn't make much difference to the plot points.  I think 'real' teenagers will pore over those parts with great care because Cassandra Clare is very good at connecting with her YA audience.  For the rest of us, the interesting storylines are more than enough to justify purchasing the next book in the series.  4 stars
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This is a great tool for golfers who don't always trust the GPS on the cart or who like to walk. It is very accurate and easy to use. Skips the hassle of downloading courses into a GPS.
B004FHCH9Q|4.0|Yes ,this is a fine film. If you liked pl, 23, fermats room (my personal favorite ) ,exam and the like then you will also enjoy Memento.<br />This movie is a very \\"on the edge\\" thriller. Its probably best not to descibe this film as a thriller but the plot has us guessing and trying to find a solution to a complex puzzle.<br />In actuality the movie questions perception and what is memory<br />. For example: I look at a pencil and before I pick it up I know what it should feel like .Its weight and texture . How do I know this ?<br />From previous experiences. My memory of seeing , touching and using a similar item. The film shows us this could be a mistake. This pencil could be filled with metal or I only think I have picked up a pencil before in my life.<br />Now this film is certaintly not about pencils but it is  about  perceptions and memories Our journey throughout  is about questioning  our protagonist memories or lack of and the way he preceives  what is in front of  his eyes and in our minds.<br />We try metaphorically to believe  a normal pencil is in front of us  but slowly as the movie progresses find  the pencil is filled with metal and are forced to question our memories and perceptions in everything we now are going to experience. The director,editor and script gives us a very interesting ride.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|Lake Cohen never expected to be starting senior in a new state. But she never expected her father to suddenly die from a heart attack. And she certainly never expected to fall for the boy next door after just three days. But from the first moment she met Will, there was chemistry. That is until she finds out that the boy that made moving from Texas to Michigan bearable is actually her new poetry teacher.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect form Slammed and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the characters and the plot. Lake is eighteen but she acts with the maturity of someone much older. She's responsible and caring and best of all - she realises that romance isn't the most important thing in life. Her relationship with Will is beautiful to watch as it develops and stumbles though the obstacles life provides.<br /><br />The supporting characters in this book are amazing to read too. There are 9 year olds who actually act their age, teens who are not single-minded obsessed with romance and parents who make mistakes but are willing to admit their flaws. I think one of the strengths in this book is the way both Will and Lake are rounded. There is so much more to both of them than just their relationship with each other. The bond they each have with their little brothers is fantastic.<br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced with some lyrics by the Avett Brothers - a band I'd not heard previously but has since bought two of their albums from iTunes. The way Hoover integrated the music and lyrics into the story was brilliant. They bring the poetry aspect into the novel perfectly.<br /><br />This book was one of the best that I've read this year. It was beautiful and heartbreaking with characters that I cared about - I wanted to know what was going to happen next and how it would affect these people that I grew more and more attached to as the story went on. I can absolutely recommend it for anyone who loves emotional but realistic love stories where the romance is strong but not the entire story.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Another suspenseful season with Gunny and crew with an ending you won't believe. I highly recommend buying this and watching it immediately.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|An american classic, directed by De Niro it is a realistic story of life in the '60s. I loved it!
B00CI5ET7K|3.0|... as a huge Satch fan, I found it disappointing as a followup to his 2012 effort Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards. No real stunner much to my distress...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is fun this is great this is just romantic I love it I like the ways those circle thingies are guiding the or whatever
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|This book was an insight into how we form self esteem and  who and  how it is kept from developing....or it is the reality of life when children were not the center of the universe.  But actually it is his story of growing up in the before WWII.  My Father was born about the same time.....and he was a very angry ...unreachable man.....very much like Charles.  Very depressing to realize what made them into the men there were.  I don't think i will be reading more of Bukowski......hared to believe his art form was poetry.  Sad like Langston Hughes poetry.

B0090EJ99A|1.0|We chose to watch this movie on a whim.  Probably the worst thing I've ever seen.  Had I been in a theater, I would have walked out and asked for my money back.  So glad this was free on Prime as I wouldn't pay a single penny for this movie.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is so much fun ! I have it on all my devices except my cell phone<br />the challenges of the levels and the acquisition of totem to help better scoring and and the bonus round. The best game ever ! Thank you Alawar Entertainment .I love it.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Excellent book - very well written - highly entertaining -  couldn't put it down.  I'm looking forward to more books written by this author!!!

B000VHVGM8|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie. It's one of my all time favorites! I wish Hollywood was still making movies like this one, instead of recycling old themes.
193700788X|5.0|I like the way this author ends her books series, by actually ending part of it but leaving it a little bit open for the reader to figure it out.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Six year old grandson LOVES this game! The graphics are great and it's challenging with a lot  of eye-hand action
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This app is just a demo. If you would like more than 15 minutes, then you should just help the developer and buy the full version of the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you do not have this game. You should get the the the app  it seems BORING in the beginning but it gets really really really really really really better I promise. The only thing I do not like about this game is the cost 7 dollars. So if you do not have this game you need to get the app.
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|I'm new to the whole public speaking thing, and I been looking for something to give tools I need to get me started. This book did just that. Thanks
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|There will be plenty of good reviews here. Mine will be poor review.<br /><br />I just bought this book to support the path of this awesome artist. When i read it i found an excellent book, full of jokes.<br /><br />Most important, this book was written with the heart (or unicorn ink)
B004W1GCNC|1.0|I didn't even make it through two episodes.  I wish I hadn't wasted the money and had listened to the other reviewers, dumb of me.
0399226907|5.0|Nice book for a little one on the go. Great for little hands and fingers.  I still love this story and illustrations after all these years.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The evil in this book is not my thing.  I try not to bring this kind of thoughts into my mind.  The characters were unpleasant and not anyone I liked.  Parts were unbelievable and so sad.  I read it and then tried to put it out of my mind.  if I had read this book first I would have never read &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|There is just static in the background.<br />There should be a test run for this so we don't waste our money.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|By far one of my favorite books! It envokes all emotions throughout the story. It makes you cry, worry, smile, and it is definitely thought provoking.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Whenever my games on my xbox gets old this is always a good game to come to. A lot of immersiveness and multiplayer is good.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really good, but kind of a little hard to handle. But overall it's a good game. I hope that they make another one just like it.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's almost exactly like Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but , you know, Oz themed.<br />I like it. The graphics are awesome and it relieves you of boredom for a while.<br />And admit it, you like The Wizard of Oz. Don't worry, we won't judge you...<br />Unless you say you would rather be watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Then we will most definitely judge you.<br />But, if you're bored and have an extra dollar lying around, I suggest you put it to good use, guys. Buy Temple Run: Oz.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|In his new tome, \\"Choose Yourself\\" James Altucher continues to splash cold water in the face of readers. More than his other strong works, this book is even more powerful - an awakening for those who are smart, open-minded enough to absorb the messages.<br /><br />The thread that winds through the entire read feels like a warning. Like we need to listen. There's an urgency to the flow. Like it's time for an uprising, a wake-up call within each household, every mind, to embrace and prosper within the economic, social landscape which exists today. How our world has changed since the financial crisis and the Great Recession. This isn't your grandparent's economy or America, anymore.<br /><br />James' work overflows with lessons, tips, ideas on how to rise above, choose yourself over the masters who enslave us: Corporate America, negative people, and even our own minds and bodies which minimize the potential to build a healthier, wealthier life.<br /><br />Jame has flashed dogma-destroying death rays at thousands of readers over the last few years. Corporate America is cheap labor, the \\"American Dream\\" of owning a house was a marketing campaign of the mortgage industry designed to enslave us, college was/is a waste of time. When I first began to follow James' popular blog, I was reeling, trying to repel, while at the same time, absorbing uncomfortably, his messages. There are components of all his ideas I fully believe - fortunately, I realize every day how right he is. How mainstream JA's ideas are becoming due to his relentless, important messages and his gift to communicate to/with the masses.<br /><br />\\"Corporations don't like you. This is not a surprise to capitalists and entrepreneurs or even artists. The entire idea behind a corporation is to set up a legal structure that takes advantage of cheap labor.\\"<br /><br />\\"The middle class is being replaced by robots.\\"<br /><br />Jame Altucher walks, talks his \\"Daily Practice.\\" He outlines specific, daily actions you must take to realize personal potential and find inner peace. Through all his writings, I've learned to respect the \\"Daily Practice,\\" and his fortitude to stick it out, but I just can't achieve his level. I strive each day, which should count for something. JA owns it, masters this stuff. I'm slowly getting there. You will too.<br /><br />James writes: \\"Abundance only comes when you are moving along your themes. When you are truly enhancing the lives of the people around you. When every day you wake up with the motive of enhancement. Enhance your family, your friends, your colleagues, your clients, potential customers, readers, people you don't know yet but would like to know. Become a beacon of enhancement, and then when the night is gray, all of the boats will move toward you, bringing their bountiful riches.\\"<br /><br />James shares his story. He's lived ten lives in 45 years. His empathy for others resonates throughout this work. He provides priceless content from his own experiences. He outlines how anger, resentment, regret will kill you and how to get past the negative thoughts that destroy.<br /><br />James' writing is personal, very conversational, breezy with a hint of wince (because he's so honest and self-effacing)- He's a master storyteller with a fascinating story to tell. Evert experience he's lived - losing fortunes, losing loved ones, losing himself, gaining it all back, losing it again (then gaining it all back whew), is here. It's amazing how self reflective he is. How he's able to recall, document and then tell the stories to make readers wiser.<br /><br />There are people out there who love him, there are plenty who hate him. Either way, you can't deny the honesty in his writing. He wears the love/hate stuff like badges of courage. Why? Because he has \\"chosen himself.\\" And there's empowerment in the choice.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this game-changing book. It's James' best work yet.<br /><br />I wonder how he'll top it, but knowing him, hewill.<br /><br />And us, the readers, the followers, will be better for it.<br /><br />Free your mind.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I usually don't read this genre of book but I thought I would give it a try and I loved it.  My husband is now reading it and my sister-in-law.

B009XY97VC|5.0|My daughter requested this purchase. Not sure where she heard of it but a most excellent album.<br /><br />The songs are fantastic masterpieces. Been listening to it at work which is helpful since I deal with movies all day long and these songs transport me to some of the most epic battles in my mind ^_^
B0058SNKM4|3.0|I purchased two pair of crocs this design and another sling back style Malindi, one in black and the other in brown. The Malindi flat fit perfect, it was wide enough to accommodate my swollen feet (4weeks post-op Bunionectomy). However, just as some of the other reviews indicated, the sling strap is a bit short and it does push your feet closer to the front of the shoe. I'm hoping that as the swelling goes down this won't be such an issue with me, its not really bad at this point, I certainly don't need any shoe pushing my toes. The Jayna flat was the same size but more narrow and small; it fit like a size 9, much too tight to accommodate my foot with the swelling. So, I sent them back in exchange for the Malindi in Brown, I wanted 2 pair. I received the brown color Malinda flat the next day and it was not as wide as my Malindi in black. I compared the shoes by putting them together and the black was much wider than the brown, the exact same shoe, in the same size. The brown color was tight, too tight definitely not as comfortable as the black pair. So it seems like there is no consistency in how these shoes are made. I ordered on line because I graduated out of the surgical shoe and my Dr. wanted me to have a wide shoe. I don't like the unisex crocs many other people ware, there is no femininity in those shoes, so I sought out to get a wide shoe (so I thought) that will accommodate my post-surg feet with comfort. I will no longer purchase crocs. I never really liked crocs, but my doc. suggested them, because of them being wide. I suppose he was thinking of those bogus looking unisex clogs . As far as the strap being a bit too short, I will add heat to it to stretch it, and I will purchase Neutralizer shoes instead. The three stars are given for the prompt return and refund, as well promptly receiving this second order.<br /><br />Its was a nice thick rubbery shoe.<br /><br />Suggestions, unless you are unable to go to the store and try these shoes on to attain a better fit, I would not suggest you purchase crocs on line. If so, just remember there is a note above the shoes that says that you can return all crocs.<br />As I found, you may not know what you're going to get. I remain neutral at this point in terms of recommending them or not, you decide.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed it just  as much as watching on full screen. Can not wait to see sequels. Actors did a good job.
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|... concerning the superstar status of \\"countertenor\\" Philippe Jaroussky, this DVD compendium of his Greatest Moments in Concert should certainly convince you. Jaroussky has a fine voice to be sure, but it's his technique that makes him special, his breath control, his tuning, his command of dynamics and phrasing, and above all his subtle artistry with the embellishments which bring Baroque music to life. His technique is second to nobody's of any gender.<br /><br />These concert clips date from 2006 to 2011, and feature Jaroussky with seven of the hippest HIPP ensembles on the scene: Ensemble Matheus, Le Concert d'Astr&eacute;e, Ensemble Artaserse, L'Arpeggiata, Ensemble La Fenice, Concerto K&ouml;ln, and Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne, plus three 19th C songs accompanied by pianist Jerome Ducros, plus a Shostakovich Prelude for two violins and piano, with Jaroussky playing top fiddle. The composers include Vivaldi, Handel, Monteverdi, Purcell, Strozzi, Porpora, Caldara, Rossi, Cavalli, Sances ... and then Hahn, Lekeu, and Massenet! It's certainly true that Jaroussky's brilliant technique is on display more in the 17th/18th selections that in the Parisian salon songs; the former are simply better music, but the latter are charming enough. There are 33 tracks in all, a cornucopia of vocal splendors.<br /><br />I mentioned the hipness of the HIPP ensembles, didn't I? Jaroussky is a remarkably \\"good sport\\" for a superstar. He's willing and able to play around with pop styles and jazz inflections, especially with Christina Pluhar's L'Arpeggiata and cornettist Doron Sherwin. And he pulls off some delectable spoofery with female tenor Marie-Nicole Lemieux. This is a DVD of high artistry and hi-jinks. Jaroussky is at his best in concerts, where and when his presence is best felt, rather in in fully-staged operas. Not that his acting skills are poor! He's at least as good an actor as Luciano Pavarotti ever was. But his singing is so much more astounding than his character-playing that one almost wishes he'd just stand stage-front and warble.<br /><br />Jaroussky is paired with soprano Nuria Rial on two tracks: Monteverdi's \\"pur ti miro\\" with L'Arpeggiata and Handel's \\"io t'abbraccio\\" with Artaserse. This is a vocal marriage made in Heaven! The two voices are utterly dissimilar yet blend and tune with each other magnificently.<br /><br />You can hear most of these \\"moments\\" of Jaroussky's various CDs, and indeed if you are a Jarousskynik you might well have those CDs already. Even so, it's a treat and thrill to see him project and emote. Don't miss it.shes he'd just stand stage-front and warble.<br /><br />Jaroussky is paired with soprano Nuria Rial on two tracks: Monteverdi's \\"pur ti miro\\" with L'Arpeggiata and Handel's \\"io t'abbraccio\\" with Artaserse.

B00AFEY354|5.0|Excellent technical quality film. The story's main plot centers around a nerdy, shy freshman and a sophisticated senior, Emma Watson. (Who knew that she existed outside &#34;Harry Potter&#34; films.) Considering the subject matter, she exhibited a very touching, well acted performance. I'm and old guy, who remembers my 1950's high school days. This brought back memories of the pleasant angst that seemed to go on forever, with the older woman (around 18 years old). Definitely not a &#34;chick flick,&#34; but great nostalgia created by a thoughtful writer and understanding director. (Okay, so maybe it is a &#34;chick flick,&#34; too.)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man is a great game. Easy to figure out. Many things to do with this game and the picture and detail are very good. Enjoy playing with it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I got the app as a check for homework.  It makes every thing else look like a slide rule. It not only gives you the fraction, but it gives you the decimal equivalent as well.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This is an essential accessory for your GoPro! I guess the only thing that would make it better is if it had a built in battery pac too! The touch screen is nice, but keep in mind that you actually have to press firmly. Highly recommend.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|After spending $14.99 to watch this movie, we were not pleased that it completely stopped working several times, either froze entirely or we got a &#34;loading&#34; screen.  This added 1/2 hour to the viewing time and was very unpleasant.  We don't have any issue with our bandwidth as we have huge capacity and stream movies all the time.  The problem is with this movie's streaming.  I am not satisfied with the experience but don't see any way other than this review to let Amazon know that there was problem with streaming this movie.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This &#34;generation&#34; of Batman movies is spectacular. You'll have quite a hard time finding someone who has not seen The Dark Knight, and this sequel takes the momentum of that movie and pushes even further with great storyline and unexpected twists and turns that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />*BUT*<br />I would suggest watching the two preceeding films before watching this! It builds off of both movies at times. They are fantastic films, though, so why not buy all three?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game but takes too long to get points to open new games.  l would like it better if you got more points for rebeating games multiple times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E L James keeps the story line going and ties off all the loose ends before the end. Although I was sad to see that this would be the last book of the series....
B000FBFN1U|5.0|No spoilers ---  George R.R. Martin is a master of the genre, who does an impeccable job of developing lovable characters only to dash them on the rocks and delights in delivering just desserts to villians with equal depth.  This book does not disappoint, and left me ready to curl up with book six.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author once again very detailed and creative that made me feel like I was watching the story unfold in person. Great job E L James!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was honestly not helpful, It is hard to find the words... Doughnuts read the book. :P lol I am sooooooo bored. Honestly Idk what to say... Oh! I know!  YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BOOK ON UR KINDLE! U CAN'T DELETE IT! :(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E. L. James is a great writer, the story kept me intrigued the whole way thru. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00B2166BS|4.0|I heard that this was a faster more convenient way to charge the tablet and so far that appears to be true.  The mfg supplied USB method was so so slow, this charger made a big difference and it is a snap to connect no worrying about screwing up the port.<br /><br />I've only had it for a month so as far as longevity,  I will have to update and that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I was fortunate enough to read this wonderful new book by the author James Altucher (I first read his work by following him on twitter @jaltucher and reading posts on his website jamesaltucher.com).<br /><br />It is one of the most enjoyable and informative books I've ever read, and I highly recommend folks take some time to check it out.  It's not that long but, wow, is it packed with powerfully-good information.<br /><br />I could write about it for a while but, rather than doing so, it is probably more efficient to just mention a few of my favorite tidbits from the book in hopes that you'll give it a read.<br /><br />My personal favorite aspect of the book is its unique ability to be both practical and idealistic.<br /><br />Some quick examples:<br /><br />First, his impressive intertwining of the importance of mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional harmony.  Here are one of his recommendations from each of these four pieces:<br /><br />Mental: \\"Read two hours a day.\\"<br /><br />Spiritual: \\"Do this every day: wake up and think of five people you are grateful for in your life right now.\\"<br /><br />Physical: \\"Am I sleeping enough?\\"<br /><br />Emotional: \\"Am I expressing gratitude to the people who are good to me?\\"<br /><br />Lastly, a few short snippets:<br /><br />I really enjoyed his insight into an alternative way of creating value (which I personally feel is an important key to cultivating capitalism optimally):<br /><br />\\"The only way to create value for yourself is to create value for others.  Exercise: think of two people in your network who don't know each other but you think can add value to each other's lives.  Introduce them.  Do this every day.  Get better and better at it.  The more value you bring to the people in your network, even if it doesn't directly bring value to you (in an immediate way), the greater the value of your network. And then the greater value you will have.\\"<br /><br />I also liked his advice on how to learn from others:<br /><br />\\"Don't be a hater! Ninety-nine percent of people are haters.  Bless that which you want.<br /><br />If you want to be successful, you need to study success, not hate it or be envious of it.  If you are envious, then you will distance yourself from success and make it that much harder to get there.  Never be jealous.  Never think someone is 'lucky.'  Luck is created by the prepared.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend taking some time to read this wonderful author's intriguing ideas.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I particularly love the amount of search areas I can search for items; even across state lines at the same time.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|A quick but interesting read. Israel has tried the planned economy route and has defaulted back to it's key asset: Highly educated and motivated people. We could learn and re-learn lessons from this book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Always has something new each episode and I want to continue with the following episode right away ! I recommend 100% if you like this kind of series
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Although well written, I found myself relating to the characters less and less. So much so that reading became a bit of a chore. The Jacob character is thin as a character and while the parents were much more interesting and relatable initially, I found myself not caring if they won or lost the case. In other words, the book lost me.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is a really good pop/alternative cd.  There really are no songs on the entire album that are horrible. Highly recommend.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|The only reason I insisted this was because it was picked by my book club. I didn't like the main character and I don't think there was enough insight into what she does or doesn't do.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the show and was interested in checking out the books.  Both are great but the show doesn't go into as much detail as the books do.  I really enjoy the dark fantasy and the realistic feeling of the world.  I would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys the show or fantasy in general.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Since I love horses this helps me gave an idea about how to take care of a horse and its entertaining. It's fun entering my horse in competitions. Install This game if you love to play with horses and take care of them.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app you can wake up to your favorite music!!soooo cool it was worth 99&cent; for sure!!!!!
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth has outdone herself on this CD. What a tribute to the past singers ! No other Blues/Jazz singer has put together a collection of Blues songs such as this. From Beth's Upper East Coast Blues voice on \\"Them There Eyes\\" to a classical perfect Beth Hart, (her voice) on \\"Close To My Fire\\" this is a perfect CD. True, it's not a pure Blues CD, but it belongs in your collection. The only times Tina Turner has done \\"Nutbush City Limits\\" better than Beth's cover was when Tina was live on stage in high heel shoes ! If you are a Blues fanatic like I am, \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\" is now in my top 10 Blues songs ever recorded sung by Beth. \\"Strange Fruit\\" is a prime example of Beth's genius, a dark, slow song sung with husky voice parts that only Beth could add. If you like Blues/Jazz music or just Beth Hart, you must buy this CD. BTW, Joe Bonamassa is not bad !
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|If you want to pass time, this game will keep you busy building things, gathering items and training for battles.

0061928356|5.0|Our Book Club had this book for our last get together and I think half of them said it was the best book they had ever read.  It is one of those books that you don't want to put down and just want to keep reading.  Good all the way through!

B005S9EK1S|4.0|The acting was a little so-so but I thought the story was pretty well written and come on, Zac Efron is in it!!
0805028846|5.0|I have used this book with kids from 7 to 14 in my art classes and they all love to look up things to made 3 D.<br />It's a fun book to let them use up extra time doing something creative.  They fight over it!
B00005N6KG|3.0|Good news: This is ultra-light, fits well on my head/in my ears, and stays put while running.<br />Bad news: Wires broke both near the plug and the left earpiece so sound goes intermittent. This is after maybe two months of use. Buy these only if you can get them in bulk because they're far more fragile than anticipated.
B00CRW2066|3.0|Has a few good songs, including I Should Live in Salt, Demons, and This Is The Last Time, but overall the slow melancholy pace of the album just makes it feel like it drags.  Doesn't have any of the edge that some of their previous albums have had.
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|Very entertaining and it delivered a good message as well.  I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan, but he did a nice job in this one.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|For a free game this one is great I like all the game options. I just wish the combat fights had more strategy interaction. But over all its great..

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love the blue ray version of Season 3.  It's so vibrant and lovely to watch!  I would highly recommend purchasing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was so entertaining.  I didn't think I'd find another writer that wrote comedic, entertaining banter so well after reading Alice Clayton's \\"Wallbanger\\" and \\"Unidentified redhead series;\\"  but Chase nailed it with this book.  I loved being in the guys head.  I actually felt like I understood guys better after this, however I won't fool myself, this is written by a woman.  It makes me wonder how she did her research.  Great book.  I want to gift this to my good friends.<br /><br />I got so into the characters and I loved the honesty yet desirability of Kate- Smart, String, Stubborn, yet hard to get, rightfully dramatic, slightly complicated, but upfront. Drew is hilarious.  I love his analogies.<br /><br />I actually wanted to read the book all over again as soon as I finished the last page.  I can't wait until the next one comes out in December.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Such a sad story with a wonderful ending. Thank God for her return to her family.  I'm surprised she kept her sanity.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Pros:<br />1. It's relatively fast, even on my older Velocity tablet.<br />2. The sections are arranged logically and are easily accessed.<br />3. Data is clear and concise and it isn't overloaded with 'bells and whistles'.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Initial loadup is a bit slow (but my tablet has minimal memory).<br />2. No suspend function so it runs continually (I just access the applications menu and halt it there).<br />3. Could use a better radar imaging feature but that would eat memory.<br />4. Biggest con: You MUST be logged into and signed on the Amazon AppStore to use it.<br /><br />Overall, the app does exactly as it is supposed to.  I do not like being coerced however.<br />***App was \\"updated\\" and promptly stopped working on my android tablet.***

B00A7W29BE|4.0|Tried it a couple times it works well is easy to use not much to say about quality but to be fair not one of this kind of programs passes that test it's ok and it does what it should oh and did I mention I got it for free? ...Cause I did
B0007TKNII|5.0|The quality and sound from the DVD was amazing!  My daughter likes to travel with the DVD and the portable player in the vehicle.  This is a must for our travels!  You will enjoy it also!
B0094D462M|5.0|Sort of 80s nostalgia especially since Miramar is no longer a Navy facility.  My favorite scene is still the upside down flying over the MIG.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this version of Spider very much.  I especially like the Undo capability.  I would recommend it toanyone who loves the challenge of playing Spider Solitaire.
B005USZYDU|4.0|When I first saw this was a new series by Grisham I jumped on it because Grisham is a good author.  However, this was a short book in comparison to the work product you would expect from Grisham and in my estimation it was overpriced for a kindle edition.  Even though I liked the story and the characters I am not sure if I will purchase another due to the cost.
1844281698|5.0|This book is a great introduction to teaching: Everyone can create.  Just try.  Keep it simple and see what happens!  Pass it on.
B004LP10PO|4.0|I bought this because it has always been a favorite, and after I saw the Pierce Brosnon remake I wanted to compare them.  It took me a while to order this one, but if you have them both; watch them back to back and make your own decision....I liked the sophistication of Faye Dunaway in the original; and would have liked that same polish in the remake.  That said; it is a great story, the current upgrades to movie making shows up in the obvious differences, but the story remains the same.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I love the music inside. I just wish that there was a hard copy I could buy. I would've liked to have a CD.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I don't get tired of watching this instant classic. I know it may not line up exactly with the weekly show but the character development is wonderful. The Addams family is always upbeat and the one liners, &#34;Don't torture yourself that's my job&#34; are great. They don't make movies like this anymore.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's fun and easy to play. I fully recommend this app for horse and animal lovers alike.
B00149512I|5.0|I was surprised to get this record and find that it plays at the speed of a 45&#34; record, despite being the size of a stand 33&#34;.  Still, an absolutely fabulous record.  &#34;Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver&#34; is one of my favorite songs
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Very enjoyable game &amp; graphics are really nice. Like the setup and the different types of quests. Just nice to step into a different world for little bit each day:)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very good book about love and loss; about dreams and shattered hopes; about war and poverty; and about reunions and families coming together. I highly recommend this novel!
B004HD61KE|4.0|I love Rollins.  He is an excellent thriller. Not only do his books keep you up at night, but this one's kept me up for two nights!! Awesome!!!!#
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|I would have never thought of George C. Scott as Mr. Rodchester, but I beleive he did a great job! the only things I did not like were the ages of the actors - Jane looked in her mid-thirties - and the storyline was chopped.  It was try to the love story, but not the best Jane Eyre's I have seen and I think I have seen all of them...
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I will definitely watch this again! I loved everything about this movie. I know Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for the movie, but Bradley Cooper's performance was amazing!!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I chose this book because, Nicholas Sparks is already one of my favorite authors and his books never let me down when I am aching for a good read. His written words draw me in to the story and make me feel what the characters feel. I recommend this book for anyone, male or female, that enjoy feeling a story and getting lost in a good book.
1401324649|5.0|I'd noticed this book on bookshelves many weeks before I actually purchased it. For some reason I've always held a prejudice against novels with really random names such as The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed out of the Window and Disappeared, because I always think that the random titles are just a marketing scheme to get readers to buy the books, but I suppose all book titles do that... Anyway, for that reason I decided not to give this novel a read, however, after a friend of mine suggested this book I thought I'd give it a go- and when I saw the novel was on a `buy-one-get-one-half-price' deal I decided, `why not'? And to be perfectly honest, I'm so glad I picked this book up, it was great!<br /><br />The novel is split into two parts based around the adventures of Allan Karlsson, a ninety-nine year old Swede who decides his mundane life in a retirement home is not the life for him. The first story is that of Allan's escape from the home (through his window) and his accidental theft of a suitcase from a rude man in a bus station. Allan has no idea that the rude man is in fact a notorious Never Again gang member or that the suitcase has 50 million Swedish Krona in it! Needless to say, when the gangster finds out Allan has stolen his suitcase, he immediately groups all of the gang's resources to hunt down the hundred-year-old man. However, what the gangster doesn't realise is that though Allan is old, he is also very resourceful and manages to make new friends to evade the gang members and even the police! Nevertheless, when the leader of Never Again gets involved, Allan and his friends have to be careful or they could end up losing their lives!<br /><br />The second story (and the one which I preferred) is that of Allan's life. What's so interesting about Allan's life is that he seems to have been at nearly every major historical incident in the 20th Century! Whether that be a friend of Franco's in the Spanish Civil War, working on the A-Bomb, working with Stalin, been thrown into a Soviet Gulag, been in the Korean War and working for the CIA, Allan seems to have been a major influence on all of these events. I really loved this side of the book because one I love history and two because it makes you think about older people and some of the major events in world history which they have lived through. I think this novel makes this a key point in a sort of `don't judge a book by its cover' way. Many people judge the older generation as been boring and sometimes a bit of a nuisance, but in reality they have all lived through these extraordinary events and many (like Allan) may have taken part in them, which I think is amazing!<br /><br />All in all, this was a great book and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read an interesting and humorous novel with a bit of history thrown in on the side! I don't know what books to compare it to because I've never really read anything like it before, but it has definitely persuaded me to give books with really random names such as Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, The Monk who sold his Ferrari and A Short History of Tractors in the Ukraine a chance!<br /><br />For more book reviews google adam-p-reviewsn, been thrown into a Soviet Gulag, been in the Korean War and working for the CIA, Allan seems to have been a major influence on all of these events.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie!  Appropriate for a teen and fun for adults, too.  We all enjoyed this! Qualit of the Amazon Smart TV version was excellent as well.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Great sequel that ties up some loose ends.  If you loved the first, this one is slightly better.  Cat and Bones are characters that are fun to cheer on.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie gets better with every viewing.<br />The contrasts between the ruling class and the working class are breathtaking. The scenery and the costumes take on meanings of their own. I can not wait to see it again.
B00CW665VI|5.0|UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE!  This book has hit my all time best books ever list!  Emma Chase...You rock!<br /><br />This was truly one of the most unique stories in the male perspective that I have ever read.  This story had me laughing out loud throughout the whole thing!  By the time I got to the end I was in love with Drew and his cocky attitude because even though it was his nature, he was such a sweetheart underneath it all.<br /><br />The writing had me turning pages just waiting for the next snarky expression and had me going back to pages just to re-read something so I could laugh again.  The relationship between drew and Kate was inevitable (as Drew would say) and thank God for that!  These two belonged together from the get go!<br /><br />The unique way that Ms. Chase portrays Drew had me saying to myself...\\"Yeah, that sounds right.  That is something most males would say or do\\".  The cool part is that she is writing as a male character.  To get inside the head and feelings of a guy like she did is amazing.  All women will sit and think \\"she hit the nail on the head with that one\\".  Such a fresh vantage point to write from!<br /><br />Loved, loved, loved this book and hope to hell that Ms. Chase is in the process of writing more!  She has a lifelong follower in me!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love slashing fruits.  It's a no brainer game.  Something to do while waiting for someone or something to happen.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Lyrical writing. Look for the passage that ends: &#34;and then she ravished me.&#34;<br /><br />I'll read her other work, gladly.<br />X
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book, just as much as I loved the first book. It is a page turner and I think I finished reading it in 2 days!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Couldn't finish it! Too weird for me. I think I read one third but then had to move on to another book.
B00CV5DQS0|4.0|Debut CD with several strong pop tracks (&#34;Wings,&#34; &#34;DNA,&#34; &#34;We Are Who We Are&#34;) and a great ballad (&#34;Turn Your Face&#34;). Some filler tracks aren't as strong, but the girls bring their strong (and unique) vocals to every song, making this one of my favorite girl group albums ever.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I'm a sucker for dog books and this one was right up there. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it talked about car racing a little too much for my liking.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is fun. There is one thing I don't like about it it everything have everything unlocked. Otherwise its a great game
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Awesome, captivating story.  I laughed and cried.  A heart wrenching situation but one that I'm sure happened often before my time.  It's important sometimes to be reminded of them.  I highly recommend this book.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|just when you think there can be no more story, it twists and turns again.  This series is even more intense then the first three.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Not as exciting as the first. The plot was certainly wanting... And the dialogue seemed corny. I was not impressed.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Very good movie.  I think it equals or is a little better than the trilogy.  Leavs you wanting more.  Counting the time until the next one is released
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is a great family movie make from the real life story of the Van Trapp family about the time of the being of WWll. This musical movie shows their life story and showed how they escaped the Nazi occupation. This movie has plenty of action without having graphic violence. Bonus disc has bio on the real family.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It was okay as for the movie, but did not live up to the previous Batman movies.  Christian Bale was excellent.  I would not buy it...Wait till you can get it for free
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game was an interesting twist between dungeon crawling RPG and tile matching.  It was really fun to have to match the tiles to get anywhere in the game. And the goal: to get 10 million points. Totally awesome in my opinion.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It is funny, but not for younger children or mixed age groups.  It is kind of silly but cute, again I would wait till it was shown for free.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love this photo editor! It is very helpful and I can improve photos on this editor. It is one of the only good photo editors.
B005HSL626|4.0|All that matters is that the kids love it! Keeps them busy at the times you most need it  Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a super fun game. I would reccomend it to anyone. The only thing is that in the beginning there are some glitches that slow down the tam.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an enjoyable read and would make for a great beach book. One of the things I liked best about this book was the format. The writer alternates who is narrating the story, leaving the reader to constantly decide where the truth lies. There are several ways the story could have ended and, personally, I would not have chosen the ending Flynn did, but overall the story moves along well and there is not a dull moment.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great little game! I love the new variations-- two Om Noms to feed, new tools and switches, etc. As addictive as the first two!
B000063V8U|1.0|I've been slowly collecting Star Trek DVDs and have all of the original series along with through Season Five of the Next Generation.  Recently ran into a issue that has me reconsidering buying the DVDs from Amazon.  I purchased Season Six earlier this year and I normally like to watch 1-2 episodes a week.  Usually takes me 3-4 months to watch an entire season.  In this case after about three months I was at the end of disk 6 and discovered a default in two of the episodes which caused the show to freeze.  I asked Amazon if I could return the DVDs (wish I could have just swapped that one disk) and was informed that there is a 30 day return policy.  How many people watch an entire season in 30 days!?  I see a policy problem here.  They did agree to forward my request to the company that shipped the DVDs and I was offered a chance to return the season to them (as long as I made the trip to the Post Office and payed the shipping cost).  That was nearly two months ago...still haven't received a refund.  I've spent several hundred dollars on DVDs to this point and think there ought to be a better way.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The movie looks fantastic and is full of great characters...maybe doesn't achieve all it set out to do but I look forward to more movies from the Wachowski's who have limitless imagination and real vision.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great series opener - Definetly one of the best series on PBS or any medium. Sherlock Holmes for the times we currently live in
B005CMSDLE|5.0|I saw this movie first on HBO!!!! Liked it so much I bought it from amazon! I would watch this movie over and over! A really good movie to add to anyone's collection of movies...Saoirse Ronan did a great acting job! It was good from beginning to end.... A definite must have !
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I never played the PS2 version, and I really wanted to play this game, so I decided to get this PS3 version instead, since it is visually more enhanced. I really like it. It also comes with ICO, which I think was their first game. My TV does not support 3D so I cannot review that. But it is a great game anyway.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Great show. Very glad I found it to watch! I would suggest watching this show espescially since its free for prime members.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Wrapped up the majority of story lines but didn't have that zing that previous sookie's had. Very little interactions with the vamps. It was definitely the end.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It's hard for me to watch mainstream movies anymore because of heavily recycled plots and storylines that are told just ... badly.  Being ironically cliche, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  Although the ending was a bit predictable, the movie kept me engaged the entire time either due to the hilariousness of the situations or to the development of the main characters.  The two main characters are unique and complicated in their own ways; they literally come from two different worlds, so the growth in their friendship and their understanding of each other is quite fascinating.  They are both able to handle their issues through humor and relying on each other.<br /><br />This movie is very heartwarming and leaves the audience with a touching positive message.  One thing I did think was that while I thought the movie was hilarious, some of the jokes were very politically incorrect, so if you are offended easily, this movie may not be for you.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Pac Man reminds me of the time when video games were first introduced and we used to play for hours.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again I am moved beyond words. I hope to read many more from Mr. Hosseini. My life is immeasurably enriched.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I play the original Mahjong every week with a group of friends and this game is just OK compared to the real thing.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Now I know where to purchase movies fast so I can watch movies I missed. Definitely will rent more movies using Amazon
B0010Z32OA|5.0|This have become one of my all time favorite movies. I Love this modern fairy tale! I highly recommend!  DiNiro is HILARIOUS
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|All around good story that leaves some things open at the end in a curious but not an unfulfilling way.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a darned good read. The plot is excellently constructed, the characters are rich and lovable, the suspense is great, and the ending is satisfying. It's amazing that Howey can tell such a rich story in such a bleak world with such a constrained setting. The writing is superb. Either Howey is a skilled editor himself, or this book was prepared by a professional copy editor, because there are none of the typos and little errors that are so common these days in all books, not just eBooks. One picky point: Howey should consider consulting someone about technical matters that he's not familiar with. He seems to think (for example) that radios are tuned by varying resistance, as with a potentiometer. That's wrong, of course. Circuits are tuned by balancing capacitance and inductance. Howey might also have done some research on factors that impede radio signal propagation, and antenna theory. Still, this is a small matter. It's easy to suspend disbelief for storytelling this good.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My attention was grabbed from the first paragraph.  If I could have read the entire book in one sitting, I would have.  Stephen King`s mastery of story and description really shine.  He has created a compelling story and characters you come to care about deeply.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|The film dragged a bit in the beginning.  I didn't like the continual use of low light shots.  Turn the lights on!  I liked the outcome but it was painful getting there.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I was very dissappointed with this movie. All of the best scenes were used a previews on the television. Would not recommend to anyone else.
1551113376|5.0|Excellent condition. I could not be happier. This book is almost like new. Great book for studying in my class.
1423113454|5.0|these are great books to read with you tween kids. there is lots of action and imagination involved. the characters are great
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller is working perfectly as I hoped it would. The kids enjoy using it because it is really great
1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan is a great writer in this genre. The books are very inovative and informative. Kids and adults will both enjoy these very much.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game. It's very peaceful and stress free. It requires patience in some parts but it's a whole lot better than the other games like this I've played. I loved the movie finding Nemo and I'm so happy that this game was made although I maybe a little old for Pixar related things but I grew up with lizard. Anyways the graphics are great and the music is soothing. My boyfriend likes the game too and now we seeing who's reef is bigger lol. He says the game is unique. I hope to God there will be more games like this one. Maybe they should make a game like this for toy story or cars maybe even bugs life. I hope they do :) I give this wonderful addictive game five stars. Thank u for your time<br /><br />From Blazy
B0088749CW|4.0|Hollywood critics and fans alike are often unkind to actresses who become famous elsewhere and then star in the big screen.  Whether it be Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, or now Jessica Biel, those who find fame in music or modelling first and then jump into acting often get panned by the critics.  For Jessica Biel, this is unfortunate as she has tackled a wide variety of acting roles since joining the big screen as a teenager.  And most of them did not emphasize her good looks.  Whether it be Ulee's Gold, Next, A-Team, or The Illusionist, her acting chops are always spot on.  This again is the case with The Tall Man.  To my knowledge, this is the first time she has played a criminal, though in the protagonists's role.  The movie came out to little fanfare as its story-line was unorthodox and its setting less than glamorous.  However, the movie is quite engaging, and Biel pulls of her role quite well.  Overall, a good movie and well worth watching.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. I enjoyed all the twists and  turns. Great read and I would highly recommend it.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son absolutely loves this! He was so excited to open it for his birthday. Very happy with the Minecraft LEGO set!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We saw this first in the theater and loved it.  Whenever I watch the DVD, I am singing the songs to myself for days afterwards.  A wonderful and very well acted version of this classic tale!
B000MQPKVG|1.0|Story about a soulless man taking advantage of people. What's to like? The characters wooden performances didnt help either. Rent anything else
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|My grown children suggested that we watch this show which I had never seen or really heard of.  We bought the already aired first three seasons and love, love, love it!  Would definitely recommend this to others!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This show is addictive! I really enjoy the way the sets, costumes, and the actors combine to create engaging worlds. Fun!
0425252868|5.0|This book, like \\"Unbroken\\" was a fast read because it was so interesting.  I was fascinated by Franz Stigler's detailed accounts of both life in Germany before and after 1933, and his training and survival after being drafted into the Luftwaffe.  I had read many other 8th AAF accounts, as well as the first-hand accounts from my late-Uncle Thomas Miles (349th Sqdn/100th BG/8th AAF), and the account of Charlie Brown's crew of \\"Ye Olde Pub\\" was both well-written and riveting.  There could have been many more chapters to each airman's story, but the author had to get back to the point.  Many thanks for an excellent book.  More people should hear of the honor, chivalry, and decency in which our boys and the Germans fought a terribly bitter and destructiver war.<br /> A few fun notes:<br />- I didn't know that duelling would get you ex-communicated in Europe.  I was glad that Franz Stigler was able to return to the Church.<br />- I knew that the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) was very much less political/nazified than the Army and SS, but was interested to see that factions of the Air Force (Luftwaffe) were as well.<br />- Although there were writings (albeit scant) about the White Rose Organization, I was interested that Mr. Stigler's brother was involved to some extent, and that the Cardinals of Bavaria had written sermons and publicly distributed warnings Germans about national socialism and the threat to their freedoms.<br />- I also hadn't realized that Luftwaffe General Galland not only survived Goering and the SS death-warrants and the war, but lived into the 1990s!<br /><br />Great book, highly recommended!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Well researched, well written. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, loved the depth of each of the characters and the details of the story.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My son plays this on my Kindle all the time.  He loves the game.  My daughter loves this game also.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|I bought this move as a gift for my brother. We all loved Star Blazers back in the late 70's and early 80's. Every episode left you hanging and wanting more. I was excited to see that Japan had filmed a live action version of this legendary animation series. When we finally got around to watching it....we were all really disappointed in this effort.<br /><br />I think what we were hoping for was that this film was the beginning of a new series. Instead we watched a film that looked like it was created for television (like Red Dwarf) audiences. There were some moments of the old magic...the Yamato looks great, the music soundtrack is right on, some of the actors look the part. But overall it is a mediocre attempt at bringing this series to the big screen. One big disappointment was the way the Gamalons were represented. I wish they had stuck to the style of the animation series. The Gamalons leader Desslock was a powerful figure in the series....here in this movie he barely makes an appearance. Also the Gamalons don't even look like the aliens in the series. They look like an entirely different species from the 70's animated series. Their ships also don't have the same designs that the animated version portrays. Bottom line is that the movie is overall disappointing.<br /><br />I have heard that an American film company is interested in a live action version of this series. Maybe the Hollywood treatment will succeed over this Japanese version. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake of the entire (I saw that Yamato 2199 is currently being developed) animated series done Japanese style with today's technology. It would and could be awesome. While America has Star Trek and Star Wars....Japan always had Star Blazers....I feel the best is yet to come for this often neglected and bypassed series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this but got it anyway. The price was right after all.  It turned out to be much more fun than I thought it would be. I kept thinking just one more and I'll stop, but then I  kept going.  The upgrades help and you get them very quickly without paying real money, at least not at first.  I haven't gotten very far yet but I'm going to keep playing for sure.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Instead of just getting a JPG from a scan, you can get it automatically converted to a PDF which a bit of a time saver, Works great on my Note2
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this series. It's extremely well written and compelling. A must-watch for any sci-fi fan (or someone into bizarre crime drama).
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Hard to find a horror movie with original scares. Mama has them! There were some camera angle scares I'd never seen before...and oh, did they work. Seriously, do not watch this film without a trusty supply of Depends undergarments. But besides the in your face, make you jump scares, the movie almost NEVER lets up the creepy intensity. The whole thing makes your skin crawl. The acting was awesome, esp. Jessica Chastain. She disappeared into the role so much that I didn't even recognize her. When I saw her name in the cast, I did a doubletake.<br /><br />Two negatives: {Spoiler Alert} The psyche doctor wasn't believable. He was too smarmy and the story had him do things that no one, I mean NO ONE would ever do. And, the ending was a little silly. That's the trouble with such an outlandish and creative premise...it kind of paints the writer into a corner, and it's really REALLY difficult to end it with anything satisfying. All in all, a great flick; scary, atmospheric, and fun.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|Reminds me of the late 70s Arcade games. It is a very pixilated screen. I would not recommend for the serious gamer.

B006YC74E8|5.0|I needed a photo editor to make wallpapeprs for my Kindle Fire G1 without the need of using my home computer to edit the picture.  I've used it a couple of times and I feel it works great.  Looking forward to using some of the other settings in the future, but for now, just cropping the photos is what I need.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|If you dont have a DVD of this Mozart masterpiece , this is your choice by far. A beautifull vibrant production, sets and customs are magnificent as well s the stage direction. The great Sir Colin Davis conducts an orchestra that loves him, and finally you cant miss this Queen of the knight performed by the amazing Diana Damrau, her singing is out of this world , and also her acting is remarkable , the way she look Pamina and her hands moving around , incredible. The rest of the singers are also excellent.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Figured I'd watch it because of all the name brand people in it. Did not enjoy anything about the movie.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the reviews that I have seen for this series!  People, it is just a book, a long written series, and the ending did the series justice.  What a great ending to this very beloved paranormal series. Ms. Harris has done a fantastic job in tying up all the loose ends of the story of Sookie Stackhouse. I pretty much have stayed away from all the speculation as to how the story would end, because all that discussion takes the fun out of the series. So I won't be putting any spoilers in here. The story is well developed, and follows Sookie as she finds herself in a little bit of a pickle with the murder of... and I can't and won't say who it is. But it's a page turner that's for sure. I'll miss Sookie, but with some tales coming later in the fall, we'll get one last chance to see our southern heroine in action. Bravo Ms. Harris. 13 books and you kept this reader wanting more.<br /><br />I was glad to see Sookie end up with Sam, she wants babies, she wanted a real life.  One where she's not being tortued to the point of death. I wrote a review for \\"Deadlocked\\" stating that readers are really making a big deal out of nothing or something this series was never about.  And with Ms. Harris getting death threats?  Over a book?  Seriously, get it together and just take the story for what it was.  Southern paranormal mystery.
B00A6CT012|5.0|I am totally new to the zero waste lifestyle because of this book.  To me it was wonderfully informative and encouraging.  It will take me years to accomplish all that she has but I am so glad to start the journey (4 weeks in now).  Although the author is not a Christian, the book was convicting to me on a Godly level.  How much more clearly will I be able to see the blessings of God without all of the \\"stuff\\" that is weighing me down?  Have you ever considered why Jesus collected the scraps of food after he fed the 5,000?  I am wondering now!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Very lovely album, I bought it is a gift for my mother and she truly appreciates it. Great album, I recommend it.
159463176X|2.0|I have read the other two books by this author and was really looking forward to reading this book.  Unfortunately, this book is the worst of his titles.  The book needed about 50-100 additional pages to \\"finish\\" the story, as the characters lacked a connection to one another.  Hosseini usually does a better job of tying characters together, but in this book, they all have a chapter dedicated to their story with no real connection with one another.  Additionally, the culture that is usually so present in Hosseini's books is lacking here.  There is very little focus on the Afghan people/culture as I expected there would be.  Overall, it was a very disappointing story.  I do not recommend this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great episode, filled with lots of drama. This show is definitely addicting. Can't wait to watch the rest of them
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|the object of this game is to build a city with farmhouses crops. buildings  like steakhouses burger houses  and other food places.  adding electric. taking care of your neighbors. kids love it.
B0000648WZ|4.0|This movie has great action scenes and is fun.  The violence is quite graphic and is not for the faint of heart.  The visual effects are terrific and should be a must for sci-fi fans.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the characters were as flawed as we all are.  Our histories make us who are and who we will become is a choice and if we want to change  its  often a deliberate battle against our natural inclination.  A leap of hope and desire.  This book illustrates that so beautifully.  I'm so glad a friend recommended it.
B004529NKC|5.0|I own all the step up movies, & this one is just another great addition to my collection.<br />If you love Moose, then you will this movie, he is amazing.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Enjoyed it but expected more. Though I always knew I would this being the first series I ever read and what hooked me in to reading.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I own every Step Up movie, and if your a big fan of Step Up, this is a must buy!<br />This movie has action, romance, and of course...AMAZING dances & dancers,<br />This movie has more intense dance scenes than any other Step Up movie. Its AMAZING (:
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Good game but slow moving. It is also a little hard to understand. It needs better directions. All in all, great to pass the time with. I would not pay for it though.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is the best of all the angry bird series. Although it is free it's worth the wait. One of the best games ever!
B0053O8AQE|5.0|the debut season of this fresh new comedy where we have 2 young ladies trying to make a better life and career for themselves by opening their  own  business
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think that this is great. But they do need more exploring space. Also villages and minecraft made mines. It's still epic!!!
B00005JOHC|5.0|the debut season of the hit comedy starring Charlie Sheen as a womanizing playboy Jon Cryer as his brother and Angus Jones as his nephew
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enjoyed it. It was an easy read and with an unpredictable ending. Recommend this book, great on the kindle. END
B005HSL626|5.0|I find this fun and challenging. I like competing against myself trying to improve my scores. Eye, hand coordination and patience!
0345495004|5.0|This book was a perfect vacation read for my recent trip to Chicago, which is near where some of the events of the book unfolded. This isn't traditional chick lit, but I imagine more women than men are interested in reading this \\"based on real events\\" fictional account of the relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and his love interest Mamah Cheney. This book hit a lot of themes that I found interesting in an approachable way: architecture, social expectations of women and marriage at the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of feminism in the U.S.  - the book was heavily footnoted and did a good job of providing references/contexts on some of the subject matter. Not having any familiarity with Wright and Cheney's story, the ending was very sad and quite a shock.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I am huge Calpton fan, so I love everything he does.  This has some interesting reinterpretations of classic songs.  Clapton still has it!
B00C4SUEJI|5.0|Reminds me of back when Kenny Loggins was really good. Playable over and over again. Not much like their previous albums, but thats a good thing, even though I liked those a great deal as well.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Another great Bonamassa offering...This is a must have for blues fans.  A solid album with no wek cuts...You will love this!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag. This bag has a good build quality and of course has its limits. It can easily hold a full size camera like the canon 1D or even 2 of the smaller ones like t3i. The compartments inside can be arranged to fit your gear. This bag has more compartments and side pockets than I expected. There is one major thing to note with this bag. It has to be laid on its back in order to get access to the main bag. If you open it up while its standing everything will fall out. Now the problem with this is if you're out and about you may have to lay it on the floor. There can be all kinds if things on the floor, dirt, water, mud, poop. Some of these nuisances may not be easy to clean out on the field. So when you're all done shooting your going to have to put it on your back and you might get dirty. I'll just be wise on where I set it. Aside from the fact it can get dirty easily (when in the floor) this is a great bag for your camera gear!
0307341577|5.0|Amazing book! Loved it and love this author...will read more from her!  I would for sure recommend this book to anyone looking for a great thriller
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much!  I do not know anything about flowers and I worried I would not be able to keep everything straight but it did not matter. The story was wonderful and all about second chances in life. Recommend it to anyone!
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Basically, this is just another sad revenge flick following the decline of a nerd (Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham).  At school, he's picked on by four thugs, at home he's picked on by his overbearing mother (Christine Belford).  Along the way, he discovers a `magic' car that helps fuel his descent into madness.  It's a wonderful cautionary tale.  Beware how attached you become to a set of wheels.  Varoom-varoom.  Bad car!<br />Actually, as horror films go, this one isn't quite as horror filled as one would hope.  It takes forever before Gordon's character abruptly turns from geek to creep.  Off go the broken glasses and suddenly he's a maniac.  It's quite the change that we never get to see.  A lot of this movie is like that, developments done off screen.  We're just expected to take it on faith that these things happened, no need to see the subtle in between moments leading up to them.  As with the four thugs who take months before deciding to exact their revenge on Arnie, by taking it out on his much beloved automobile Christine.  Or, how (never mind why) the school's new beauty (Alexandra Paul) mysteriously becomes Arnie's girlfriend!<br />I had hoped for more from John Carpenter (I never hope for anything where Stephen King is concerned).  But I can't deny I like this movie anyway.  John Stockwell is likable as Dennis Guilder, Arnie's former best friend.  Robert Prosky is suitably nasty as the owner of the `do it yourself garage.'  Alexandra Paul is miles away from her beach role on Baywatch.  Harry Dean Stanton is sorely wasted as an oblique detective.  My biggest complaint though, is too much school stuff, not enough Christine (she's not bad, she's just misunderstood).
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Another Jack Reacher book I am enjoying every one of these, novels, and aim on getting them all, Jack is a real hero and following his escapades is exciting.  Try them all in sequence.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I am an occasional Idol watcher, but this guy would've drawn me in without that launch pad. I am a huge fan of Clapton and Elvis Costello and he kinda reminds me of them a bit. He has a unique style. I heard a few tracks off this on the radio without even knowing it was him right away and made that comparision, untainted by Randy and crew... Love this album.
B00BXHLM1K|1.0|I have attended many Rigoletto performances some, excellent and memorable, some less than excellent, but I have never seen a performance with total disrespect to the essence of the period and the libretto. They are using gangster cant, more suitable to Damon Runyon.<br />Why is a classic a classic? a classic doesn't need improvements ego trips and mutilation.<br />I wounder if the Met. management could make Mr. Levine or any other conductor of his caliber to participate. I guess I will never know, but I have my suspicion.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's ok. I have trouble playing it, but I bet my kids and grandkids will have a blast with it!!!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The movie was good - it started really slow but it was actually pretty good by the end of it. It's just getting to the part where the thriller portion of the movie starts that's the trick :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this one. Have a good time playing it with the kids or just by myself.<br />Good for adults and kids.
B00BHU261S|5.0|This movie was fantastic - a little weirder than I anticipated from a quasi-biopic but I really liked it. Highly recommend!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Karahan and The Berlin Philharmonic equals professional excellence !!<br /><br />I bought this used delivered to my door for less than $24.00 !!! Awesome in every way!<br />Sound quality, mixing, interpretation, conducting, and quality abound in this set. Buy and be done.<br /><br />I smiled like a kid when this gold gift arrived and I held it in my hands! Few can truly appreciate the beauty in this treasured set!!<br /><br />Good day friends !!!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Fast paced book with some nice plot twists! A little gruesome at times, Recommend you to not start this on a plane.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It helps you to think quicker and respond faster.. It is a truely fun game.... your family will enjoy... I Love it!
B00C7JCDO8|5.0|David Coverdale and band is totally awesome very tight and even funky at times, you can tell they were having a good time<br />it's worth every penny
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I started with this franchise through the first Hunger Game movie. If you've already seen the first movie i would say it's safe to jump into the second book, but the choice is up to you. I enjoyed this trilogy because it was hard for me to put down and I'm not sure I've ever read any other books as quick as theses. Collins helps to keep you turning the page when cliffhangers and curiosity. She keeps the reader engaged without making it to complicated.<br /><br />As any book there were some predictable events, but kept enough little surprises to makeup for them.<br /><br />The trilogy was entertaining and easy to read and wasn't too long. If you enjoyed the first movie you should definitely read the whole trilogy.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a very informative and thought provolking book which I am happy that I stumbled upon. I have been exposed to many references to Tesla, but never read his biography. This puts him in prospective with his amazing contemporaries to reveal a picture of the times. Edison, Morgan, Westinghouse, Astor, Carnegie it was like another Renisaince. The book also explores the makings of genius and how these people and others became so successful and live on in history. A great read.
1433537419|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT BIBLE! I LOVE THE REFERENCES IN IT AND SIZE OF FONT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A IN DEPTH STUDY BIBLE.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Nothing like sitting on the edge of your seat, and biting your nails. He was the master of his time.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this product. It has a very good quality. It's made very well. It protects my kindle really well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room kept me frustrated in the best way-- each puzzle unlocking a new more imaginative puzzle all the way to the last piece.  Well worth the $2. Looking forwarding the next room.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't get enough of the superb acting in this story. Settings and characters are so well developed. I need to get to Season 3 - but don't want to fork out the bucks.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James cuts through the BS surrounding the ostensible American Dream, and its waning relevance. Equal parts self-deprecation, tragi-comedy, economic insight and personal development. If you are already familiar with James' work, gift this Kindle to someone you cheapskate.
B00AG297GK|3.0|Sacha Baron Cohen is no surprise here. The story line is cute and some of the dialogue is funny.  Otherwise, it's just okay.  I certainly wouldn't pay to see this at the movie theater.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who has a good pair of headphones<br />and needs some peaceful and tranquil sound. It's a very nice collection that can<br />even be blended if you so desire
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the audio and video quality was good. The movie itself is one of my favorites. Wanted to see it again before going to see the new Star Trek movie in theaters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!! It's awesome! I like how it's different from Temple Run because there are stairs, zip lines,  mines, and when you get to I think level 5 or level 6 there are more obstacles like a spinning wheel made of swords, a thin wooden plank with things falling so you have to jump to get to the other side. So if you like Temple Run or Temple Run Oz or Temple Run Brave you'll love Temple Run 2.
B00008WT5E|4.0|I enjoy this album. Just really into older AC/DC these days. Bon Scott was a much better singer than I realized. He really puts Brian Johnson to shame. Too bad he's not still around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well this game is the best mind interactive game you'll ever see so I would recommend that you should buy it dose have a high price but it is totally worth it so I would recommend this game for really anybody over 4 years old I would totally give this game five stars<br />Love bouggerbut :)
B00008BXJ6|4.0|Another great AC/DC album. Love hearing some of these songs that I haven't heard in so long. Bon Scott is incredible, and Angus shreds.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I would never buy this case again.  My toddler dropped my phone from two feet up and the case shatterred, didn't even land on anything hard.  Also, I was told by a sales rep at the cell phone store that APPLE will actually void your warranty because this case will overheat the phones.  Well after a month of using this all of a sudden APPS started opening on my phone without me doing anything and I realized my phone was on FIRE!! Needless to say I threw the case away right away!
B00CWV8X04|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, not the best thriller I've seen, but still enjoyable. The audio and video quality was good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love Watching these shows!! I just pray nothing like that could happen in real life, Only in the movies lol.
B00008WT5C|5.0|This is far and away my favorite AC/DC album! I like every single song on here. In particular, Overdose, Hell Aint a Bad Place to Be, Go Down, and Dog Eat Dog.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I wanted to see this on the big screen but missed it.  The movie is entertaining and not as predictable as some movies.
B0043URV5U|4.0|When will we get to see a DVD of the old Seger running and jumping around the stage? I seen him in Cleveland stadium in the 80's and he would do a rocking song and drive everybody crazy and then do something a little mellow like Main Street and the whole pllace would calm down you could hea a pin drop it was amazing!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome Trilogy,  Was on the edge of my seat through the whole experience.  I highly recommend this trilogy to all that want a E Ticket ride.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved the history portrayed in the piece. In particular the cotton industry since I come from the begining of the process; the growing of it. The love story is very compelling as are the portrayal of the poor people who just wanted a living wage. Ideas such a these are still elevant today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app. I play it constantly and I cant stop. I love every part of it and I am addicted. I highly recommend this app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book. Fun to read, very exciting. I wish we could see more of Christian's thoughts about little miss Ana.
B008602KQI|5.0|Not as good as the book but what do you expect.  Still a great movie.  Worth watching over and over.
B007IV11PM|4.0|I have watched about half of these.  The one thing that really annoys me, and this happened with previous season's of Doctor Who is that for some reason the xbox version of amazon instant video never marks the preview episode as watched.  Because of that issue, i have to go through the list of episodes every time I want to watch the next one and figure out where I finished off.  The episodes themselves have been good.  I particularly like the ones with the return of the weeping angels.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app. Even my three-year-old can play it. It works great on my kindle fire. It's a good game and runs without bugs.
0399215921|3.0|the book was much smaller than I expected it to be.  The story is still wonderful just would have liked to know it is only index card size.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|So glad to get this CD because I couldn't get to see them live and I wanted more than the DVDs. I was hoping this would come out and here it is, very fun to listen to, so MANY of the great songs we love. Unfortunately Carl couldn't have been there with his angelic voice but Jeff and others filled in nicely so it still sounds great. If you like listening to the Beach Boys it's worth buying.
088708155X|4.0|would be nice to know the size of the book not just if it is hard cover or paperback this book was very small.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|There were times when I couldn't put it down and times when I wondered if it was worth finishing.  It's not really heavy on mythology despite being about a variety of old world gods.  It had the makings of a good story but it could have been better.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Just saw the movie in the theaters and must say it was a visually stunning 3D film... but those lens flares, they take away about 90% of the visual appeal of the movie.  Just one question for everyone: who sees lens flares with their eyes?  Let me help you, no one... it is the result of a camera lens at the wrong angle with the sun (or light source).... but these aren't optical flares, they are CGI flares... how lame!<br /><br />Now for the movie plot: (modified due being poorly worded the first time) When the movie ended I said to my wife , \\"That was HORRIBLE!\\" (I did end up saying it loud enough that several rows of people could have heard it, not to be a jerk but because it was so loud in the theater that I needed to be sure my wife heard me)  JJ Abrams (or the writers) should have their pay checks taken back.  Why steal from previous Star Trek movies, especially when it doesn't make sense given how early in their careers this movie is suppose to take place.<br /><br />After reading many reviews on Amazon, I must agree with those who said this new Spock was horribly acted.  He does show way too many emotions.  Bones was just odd, not like the Bones I grew up with.  Then there is Carol Marcus who should have been a molecular biologist, but is instead a weapon's officer.  I also highly doubt she was ever in Star Fleet as displayed in her dislike for SF in ST2.  Then the blatant stealing of entire scenes from Star Trek 2 is just plain wrong.<br /><br />There were many other problems, but would rather not put too many spoilers in this review.<br /><br />The movie is too fast paced to be a good Sci-Fi movie, I would reclassify the movie as an Action movie.<br /><br />In the end, I was going to buy this Blu-Ray, but now am not.  I just can't bring myself to watching this \\"Star Trek\\" (should be called \\"Space Explosions\\" instead) movie again... which is quite sad as I have seen all the original series and next gen crew movies over 100 times.<br /><br />---<br />UPDATE (8June 2013): There was at least one comment that mentioned the lack of details dealing with Bones.  As for Bones, it annoyed me that he was a \\"Damn it, I not a ...\\" whore.  It seemed that every 2 minutes he was uttering that phrase.  It is a great phrase, but that often killed the mood that it is suppose to invoke.  I think he might have said that phrase more in this one movie than in all 6 of the original movies (I am re-watching the TOS now though).<br /><br />Spock: After starting to watch TOS, I have noticed more emotion from Lenard Nemoy that I remember (I have seen a smirk or two so far).  So I will lay off the new Spock for now.<br /><br />Lens Flares: Still hate them.  (Seems you can't please everyone)... they are made with a flash light on set and sometimes where there isn't a light source on set (found this out after watching a special feature from the 2009 ST movie).<br /><br />TWOK Issue: I still feel strongly that they should not have ripped an entire scene from TWOK and placed it in this movie.  As I mentioned in a response to another person's comment, it seems as though they ran out of new material and said, \\"Hey, let's put this scene in from TWOK, the fans will love it.\\"  Sadly, I am not impressed (I don't like seeing a movie I have already seen before in a new movie).<br /><br />I really want to like this new series, but I just can't.  I understand some love it, but I guess I just like the old school ST where it isn't all flashy action and re-used/over-used lines.  I like movies where the story and character development takes priority, esp when it comes to Star Trek, which is what most of the previous ST movies/series have been.  I must admit that a majority of TNG movies were faster paced, but they didn't reuse material and didn't rewrite the rule book on what ST is.
B008XMXFS6|5.0|The first two songs are good but after that the album really gets great.  It's a perfect mix of awesome 80's style rock with catchy lyrics.  The songs are funny and smartly written.  I definitely recommend the album for Darkness fans and fans of 80's power ballads.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It is hard to play because I could not find any rules as to how to use your different options or<br />how to play the game.  I don't like the &#34;Facebook&#34; idea of the game.....I like to  play bingo,<br />but, I just wanted a very simple game.  Sorry for this rating -  I guess I am just to set in my<br />ideas and ways of playing the game...  If there is an instructional page , I would give it<br />another try.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Awesome graphics! Challenging mini games! Great storyline! Vivid colors! Exceptional artwork! Cliff hanger ending! Can't wait to see the sequel!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As with all the John Grisham books, this was thrilling and exciting.  Couldn't put it down until I had finished it
B00BC24NT4|5.0|In this reader's opinion, this is one of the best le Carre novels in a long time. It's classic le Carre. Whether you're an established fan or just dipping your toe in the le Carre pond for the first time, this is a good one. You'll like it.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I've never highlighted as many sections in a book as much as this one. This is truly a life changing book! I might accidentally take this book to church instead of the Bible.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game has an untimed level that is great for a first time Mahjong player like me.  For someone more experienced, a more advanced, timed level can be played.
B00CDCIQX6|2.0|Was hoping for something more, the whole first half is disjointed and leaves you waiting to see how they pull it together. That is a long time to wait, and it never really gets pulled together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really good game. I have lots of fun playing it. Me and my dad have competitions to see who can run the longest and who can get the most coins.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|in my opinion, feedly is a great replacement for google reader, which i've been using for years.  no learning curve, and i love the way it works.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game was a lot of fun. I got so exited when I got a new pony, but wished that I could play with them more then I did. I give it five stars for being fun.<br /><br />  -Derpy
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thought the book was good. Didn't quite expect it to end the way that I thought it would, but it was good.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This has excellent graphics and a fun story which makes it better than most match 3 games currently available. Worth the money if you like simple, relaxing fun. My only complaint is that it's not long.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Our son was going through a discover the world and it's mystery faze when we bought these. It was great seeing them again after so many years!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I like this game it's time assuming so it a great  game to pass the time with and I loved the movie also
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Drew Barrymore is fabulous in this updated version of Cinderella, Love it! I would suggest this as a must see!!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|In this story there is this girl named Sage she likes to paint and this year there will not be a art show so sage is going to save the art show for everyone how love's art and she loves art so the art show is a big feeling  for her so that is the reason why she cares about it and that is my story of Sage Paints the sky so that is my story.
0345529057|2.0|Given the high reviews and friends' recommendations such as, \\"I literally could not put this book down,\\" I am disappointed. With advertising invoking Tolkien, one should expect something of substance. This purchase has no entertainment value.<br /><br />The writing is primitive, the characters derived from looking too long at Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and yes, the plot is predictable. Scenes of cursory gore follow mawkishness that make you wish some more heads would get crushed just to shave some pages off this book. Also, the mumbling tone of the narrator - what it's all third person? - is dull.<br /><br />Forget Lord of the Rings; think Prince Valiant published in Harleqin style and you get the picture. If you want to read it, get it from the library - it doesn't need to live on your bookshelf.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great game.  I really enjoy remodeling my restaurant.  Plus I enjoy trying all the recipes.  It is worthwhile to play.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Excellent CD waited yrs for it to be remastered! Going &#34;green&#34; and not using plastic is one thing, but when the case is all cardboard, the CD gets scuffed or scratched with every use! Buy a more expensive version if you can.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|I would give this 5 stars, but that would mean it's perfect, and it's not. BUT, it's almost perfect. I went back and forth between this item and the Digizoid ZO 2 portable headphone amp, and settled on the E17. Got it out of the box and immediately hooked it up via the mini USB adapter to my computer to charge it up. Went back several hours later to test it, unplugged the cord and the unit went off -- and would not come back on. THEN I started reading some reviews about faulty players not starting, multiple resets, etc., and feared I had been sent a defective unit. Finally, I found a post about how the E17 MUST be charged using a USB wall charger adapter (which come with all Ipods), and switched it over to the wall outlet, waited another hour and the unit came on.<br /><br />AND THEN I LISTENED TO IT!<br /><br />I can't tell you what a difference this device makes to listening to music on an Ipod (or, I strongly suspect, any other portable music device). I listen to music constantly, and have done so my whole life. I love music and strive to achieve the best quality I can, given my budget constraints. Well, I started to do some test listening and my jaw just dropped. The music sounded completely different, in a very good way. I heard Midtones and Treble like I never heard before, honestly thinking, \\"Is this the right track?\\"  I have only had the device a day, so cannot go into much detail as to settings, but I will recommend using the line-out dock (LOD also sold by Amazon) rather than the simpler to use headphone jack adapter. Using the LOD bypassed the Ipod's woefully inadequate processors and transforms your music. The added volume is tremendous.  There are internal gain settings, bass, treble and mid settings, which I tweaked a little, then just sat there at my desk, jaw hanging open, lost in the music, listening through my Ipod and my Klipsch Image S4 earbud headphones. An hour went by before I knew it.<br /><br />So, why not a 5-star rating? Because this device comes with no useful product manual whatsoever. It's not extremely small, but I use a hip pack to carry my Ipod in anyway and this fits perfectly inside.  However, the simplest thing, the inability to charge the unit using the supplied (and recommended) mini USB output to computer USB input, almost made me return it thinking it was not working. I feel sad for those people who did return their units before getting it to power on successfully, because I don't think I will ever go back to using my Ipod without my Fiio E17.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/27/13 - I don't know what's happened, but now I can't use this amp with my Ipod anymore, the sound is awful! I tested THREE headphones, including the Klipsch S4's, JVC Victor In-ear Stereo Headphones HA-FXT90 (brand new), and TDK Life on Record IE800 Dual Dynamic Drivers Headphones (brand new), all highly rated midpriced earbuds. I kept thinking that the earbuds were either deteriorating (the Klipsch were probably 1-2 years old, heavy usage), poorly designed (the TDK's are not designed to really \\"twist\\" into the ear canal, thereby limiting the bass response, the outside noise cancellation effect and makes it difficult to keep in the ears), or faulty unit (the JVC's are beautiful and sounded great for the first few weeks, but now, horrible THROUGH THIS AMP). So, I'm thinking something is wrong with the amp, why? Because when I disconnected the Fiio and just plugded the JVC's directly into my Ipod, BAM, the sound was back, though NOT as good as when this amp apparently was working correctly.<br /><br />All the mid's and high's had become horribly distorted and muddy, and bass had lost all of it's skull shaking OOMPH! But, when bypassing the amp, the distortion cleared up and the bass returned (as much as it could given the Ipod's limited processing capability).<br /><br />I have not tried contacting Fiio, but will, and will update again depending upon if and/or how they respond. It may just be the line out cable has been compromised (don't ask me how), or something internal has ceased to function.

B000SGSU58|5.0|I liked the twists throughout the story.  The detailed set up to the ending that kept you guessing.<br />I was happy to see Harry's relationship growing with Sylvia, hopefully it will continue in the next novel.  This was the first book that I remembered Harry being described, I might have missed it before, but I always imagined before this book that he was older, out of shape and the description in this book was a little more in shape detective and not \\"that old\\".  Now we know!<br /><br />I would recommend to any mystery reader.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love this game BUT my one complaint would be that you can't sign in under your name so that different people can stay at their level and move up on their own time!!!! Kids would love to play at their rate and advance by themselves not to have someone else do it for them :(
B000W01ZE8|5.0|They are true artists.  And challenge their listeners to expand upon the conception of genre labels of rock music. Homme's tender hearted strange burlesque opera keeps audiences curious. They are definitely the hard work and play hard band of this generation. Hate them or love them. Their musicianship and work ethic has earned them a lot of admiration among other artist. Sorry no name dropping.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app has been my go-to app since I first got my kindle fire. It runs great and has many catergories to choose from as do most pinterest websites/apps.

B00C061I3K|1.0|I have seen a lot of reviews on this CD defending this work. Let me start off by pointing out a couple of things first.<br /><br />I have been a Daft Punk fan for 15 years.<br />I am a progressive house DJ and have been so for 13 years.<br /><br />That being said, I know progressive house, trance and electronica as genres in general very well. Daft Punk is first and foremost, a house producer(s), if you want to break them out into the 2 guys that comprise the duo. I have been an avid fan and respect them for their artistic direction. Every CD was a little different, but at their core they were always producing HOUSE MUSIC. BASS HEAVY, SAMPLE HEAVY, CLUB BANGERS! Music that made you want to dance and move. This CD made me want to cry, in sadness and in anger. After I listened to this atrocity I distinctly remember yelling out loud WHAT THE F*^# WAS THAT! I have listened to this CD 2 more times. I thought to myself, maybe I'm not giving it a chance....nope, still crap. Nothing on this CD is \\"Dance-able\\". This CD is depressing not only in how slow the tracks are and their progression, but in their horrible lyrics and the dullness the whole CD exhibits. I couldn't use any of these songs in a proper set if my life depended on it. I couldn't speed the track up or match the bass lines on this CD with anything else without making it sound like I was transitioning from a fist pumping track to some sad jazz elevator crap.<br /><br />I don't want to hear the arguments that defend Daft punk saying that they simply want to take a different direction. I also don't buy the argument that as artists, we have to respect their vision and take the album for what it is. 2 simple reasons why both of these arguments do not manage to muster a shred of credibility:<br /><br />1. Daft Punk as an artist is known to be a producer of house music. If you went out and bought a Slipknot album, you would expect heavy metal, as you should,since Slipknot is a heavy metal band. If they released an album tomorrow and you were a fan and went out and bought said album, and they instead gave you a rap album would you consider that a change in direction or a change in genre completely? I would guess you would say they basically screwed you as a fan. Same goes here.<br /><br />2. This album was marketed as an album to save EDM as a sort of Messiah. This album did nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, I would say it was extremely miss classified as EDM. I would go as far as say that this album was not only not a savior of EDM but actually a laughable joke. A pretentious, self gratifying, expensive joke. Expensive for the fans, that is, as they will definitely make money from the fans that supported them all these years.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this thing months before release expecting a great CD after an 8 year hiatus. That will teach me to pre-order anything ever again. I though there would be more integrity with Daft but they have gone by the wayside as EDM artists. There are very minor tones of their greatness here, but they only barely ever even touch the surface of their old greatness. If you like the old Daft, don't buy this crap, and for those that defend this album well, then you must be fans of depressing Jazz as well. As for me, give me what I want to hear. If I want rap I will buy rap, if I want rock I will buy rock, if I want EDM I won't ever buy Daft Punk without listening ahead of time.

0307476073|5.0|This book was a fabulous, real depiction of a young woman's journey of healing.  It became very inspirational to me right from the beginning and when it ended it made me believe I could always do more than I think I can.  I love her raw-ness and honesty.  I love the description of the PCT from a real person's point of view--not a professional trained hiker.  The interactions she had throughout the journey were moving and fun to read about.  Overall it reminds you not to take anything for granted.  Sometimes just the simplicity of a cold lemonade can make someone's day, or week for that matter.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I pre ordered this book and excited to read it....  I wished I had NOT read it the most disappointing book ever.<br /><br />I kept hoping that Sookie would use this charm to make herself immortal so could live as human and not die or age, so she would have that choice to be with Eric or whoever<br /><br />Why make Eric weak  .. which is not the man we came to know<br /><br />I don't recall the rape in the trunk with Bill and will go back and read that book again, I remember he grabbed her and attacked her, but making her somewhat friends with him in the end,  well he is still there to watch over her<br /><br />In most cases I loan out my books to others to enjoy, and I offered but told them it was not really worth the time to read.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I am a fan of historical fiction in books and films, but I couldn't sit through this one.  The cast was spectacular, but the film came across as a production you'd likely be shown in an American History class when the teacher couldn't be bothered with the lesson plan for the day and had to sleep of a hangover in his car while this film was playing.

B000063DFQ|5.0|No review, just by it. You won't regret it. From start to finish, this rocks. No clunkers in this CD.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I am rating this book a three stars, for I find anything below a little to harsh. Ransom Riggs knows how to spin words and capture the audience with his tale. It is well paced and the concepts interesting. But that's the issue, the concepts were interesting, but the plot and character development were lacking.<br />First off, Jacob came off as a snobbish, rich kid with a bad family life. I felt bad for him, but he had a spoiled aire to his complaints. He constantly complained about the money he had and how he would be forced to inherit the company which had made his family rich. Also many of the words he used in his diction, a teenager would have never used realistically. Plus, his thought process was too mature for a sixteen year old boy. It stole away from the realism of this story. The mother was completely horrendous, more focused on appearance than her sons recent issues. The only character I truly enjoyed was the father, who's appearances were brief. He was the only real character in the story, that I could personally relate to. The man who constantly gave up his dreams because of discouragement, who longed to be a good father, but was unsure of where he stood. Also many of the peculiar children seemed to be lacking character development and seemed to have been randomly placed in the story to fill up space. Their powers were interesting, well at least some, but they didn't seem to go anywhere, only to fill in potential plot holes. Or there characteristics seemed stereotypical, Emma, the flame-thrower, who was hot-headed and suspicious of everyone. Like that has never been done before. Or even Bronwyn the strong girl, who wasn't so bright. She confused me. Riggs claimed she wasn't intelligent, using brawn over brains, but by the end and throughout the story, she showed a great amount of intellect, just like the other peculiar children. For instant, when they were being chased by the Hollows, instead of battling them out, she used her head and collapsed the building upon them. I don't know what that is, but I would definitely call that resourceful and brilliant. Also her ability to create a tourniquet when no one else could. I wouldn't call that stupid either. These were a few things that bugged me about the characters.<br /> The relationship between Emma and Jacob was also down-right awkward. Considering Emma had not yet gotten over Jacob's grandfather and decided it was a good idea to flirt with Jacob in the mean time was wierd. There was no friendship development before they were making out. Honestly that took away from the potential romance that could have occurred. There was no wondering whether or not they were friends or more than that. There was no chase, no mystery and the relationship felt forced. Plus it was just weird with her still fawning over Jacob's grandfather. Also, it only took two chapters after their first meeting before they were locking lips with each other and Jacob was considering leaving everything he knew after only knowing a girl for a couple days or so.<br />The plot was also lacking, it was as if the author had no clue where to go from where he started and it turned into a long chase with more questions asked than answered. Though the villians were interested, their slopped together reasoning for their maniacal plan was unoriginal. It was the usual bad guy, good guy superhero story. Plans of seizing the world in their tyrannical grasps. Honestly though, what else are villians supposed to plan for. They don't seem too interested in stealing the best recipe for scones or shrinking cities to minuture size either. I just wish he focused on answering more of the questions he created. Also the issue with the loop. If they leave their loop for long periods of time, they began to age. Well, it was great to create the suspense by using that idea, fearing for the characters lives, but the loop shut down and now they're basically all doomed. How do they wander around without aging, as they search for another loop? Surely, if they age when outside the loop for long periods of time, they should start showing the process of aging? They didn't. Overall, It truly, by the end, turned into a long-winded chase scene and if you truly want to find out what happens, you'd have to read the next book.<br />The reason why I give this story three stars is because Ransom Riggs is a brilliant writer and I was sucked into his tale. The way he spun words was gorgeous and artistic and I loved how he described the character's surroundings. The concept and powers were also fascinating and I loved the idea of combining superheroes and time travel together and creating this fascinating world of time loops and the oddest, peculiar beings ever. It also had a few good twists, that I didn't see coming, though I sligtly suspected them. I did like the story though and found the concepts interesting. Just the few problems with plot, character development, and forced relationships stole from the story and those concepts.

0374275637|4.0|The author offers great understanding about how the mind works, the biases of the mind and how subjective our statements might be. Howevever I think the narrative might be a little slow, it takes quite a time to get to the main points but for those that are constantly searching for truth and objective thinking this is a must and I believe the author's research is the foundation of many other books and studies, and the book is a very nice aproach to his research.

It is very relevant to recent events and also develops the characters and relations in so much detail that I feel like I am right there with them.  I didn't want this book to end! A MUST READ!
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Whilst frequently daring to be consciously twee, Harold Fry succeeds in evoking those moments of self doubt, and then the climb back. The final resolution doesn't quite match some of the better moments on the journey.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the fortune of reading. It is beautiful, with many rememberable quotes, but it will cause you great emotional pain and make you question yourself, your life, and love.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|This book is in no way easy to read. It starts out with a graphic account of 18 year old Alice Sebold's rape. I say account because it is mostly just facts, but that doesn't make it any easier to read. However I do think it was necessary to know the details to be able to understand how a horrible ordeal that lasted an hour affects the victim forever in so many different ways. It's a story of courage but without a halo. Sebold doesn't come off as having all the answers. She just explains how she got through the rape, trial and its aftermath. And she didn't do it without difficulty.<br /><br />The book strikes me as clinical in many ways, in particular Sebold's account of the trial and the defense attorney's attempt to exonerate his client. The facts themselves are enough to indict the legal system that always tries to blame the female victim. However, in this case, the prosecutors had a nearly perfect victim. Sebold was a virgin before the rape, was brutally beaten in easily photographed ways, had not used drugs or alcohol and after a few initial stumbles, is able to catch on to the defense lawyer's attempts to cast a bad light on her or twist her words. I really appreciate that the book didn't become a raging diatribe at any point. It simply points out ,as Sebold says, that being a woman can suck, because they are always trying to smash you down. Even the aftermath of the rape and Sebold's trying to get on with her life after the rapist's conviction rings very true and is touching without trying to emotionally manipulate.<br /><br />If you want to know how such a brutal crime can affect you or simply read about someone who made it through, it's worth reading this book.
0425263916|5.0|This trilogy has been so good!! I have been waiting for Entwined in You to come out!!! I love how Gideon loves Eva and that there is no limit to what he would do for her!

B0078XFYDA|4.0|Richard Dawkins has the Midas touch with whatever he chooses to write.  This book is no exception.  Although he took great pains to simplify the most complex issues that are faced by humanity, the book is still an informative good read.  He readily admits that he is not an expert in everything there is to know about physics, quantum mechanics and other complex areas of science, but still captures the essence of the state of the art thinking and theorizing.  Quantum physicists may feel a little let down but the rest of us will gain a new comprehension of the universe and I think many of us will be rewarded with wonderful insights into the thoughts and ideas that truly relate to humankinds grasp of reality (I rated it four stars vs five stars based on other books of Dawkins I have read, I think he oversimplified some areas to put out a shorter, more readable book for a mass audience).  Dawkins handily defends the logos of life while intelligently explaining, gently exposing and quietly condemning the mythos.  If you ever had questions about genetics, natural selection or evolutionary biology but did not care to spend four years at a major university reading them, this book is your Cliff Notes.
0756405890|5.0|I read the reviews for this book, both good and bad, before purchasing it.  I read it from cover to cover before sitting down to this review.  This is a really good book in the fantasy genre, I wanted to give it 4 or 4.5 stars because I felt it was too 'modern' in style compared to Tolkien or even GRR Martin, then realized that it was my bias of the 'way things should be' and not the merit of the book I was reviewing.  This book gets the full 5 stars with absolutely no reservations.<br /><br />The main character Kvothe is the kid with untapped powers that Harry Potter made familiar but Potter wasn't original either.  He's a combination of a genius, quick learner, musical prodigy, and hopelessly incompetent with girls.  I know all the people reading this are international gigolos who have to chase off Playmates with a stick, but I related to the awkward kid with a first crush who wanted with every fiber of his being to talk to the girl he liked and couldn't find the right words in the thousands of hypothetical dry-runs that worked through his mind.  That was definitely a humanizing touch for a kid that might have been much more inaccessible to a reader due to his overall excellence.  There were some criticisms of Kvothe being too perfect, but early and often he fails to do things he should, does things he shouldn't, and suffers consequences for them all, both internal and external.<br /><br />The writing style sets this book apart from the breathless action of pulp D&D style fantasy books, and for me seemed to be what I would describe as luxurious.  We were taken along in the story with sufficient attention to details and world-building, but not overlong and overdrawn descriptions of every blade of grass, like a relaxing boat ride down a lazy river.  Certain aspects, the history, the mode of magic in Kvothe's world, etc. got more attention but always added breadth and depth without overburdening the reader.  Other times, Kvothe's life meandered down roads and pathways that didn't lead to the forging of a fantasy novel hero, just like real life.  However, I was turning the pages every bit as fast as a pulse-pounding hack-and-slash story, but it was just to sink deeper into the world being woven around me.  At least through the first book, it seems to have less world-building backstory than Game of Thrones, and wayyyy less than Tolkien, but I'm all the more glad for it.  It's all fine and good to create your own syntax for elven, or dwarvish, or Klingon, but nobody's going to pretend that at 12 years old they knew what the hell Tolkien was talking about all the time.  This was a nice, interesting, easily-consumed story that never felt burdensome or like a slog through x number of pages to get to a \\"good\\" part.<br /><br />If I had to nit-pick this book, just to appear fair, I'll give you 3 nits.  First, it would be that the author falls victim to the fantasy-trope belief that in order to portray 'foreign lands' and people from them, there has to be a bunch of unpronounceable consonants jammed together to form a person or place name, or fragments of a language, and throw in some unaccountable apostrophes for good measure.  I could care less if I never have to skip over another nonsense name like Cthystler'rn in a fantasy novel again.  There are a handful of these in this book, but they never really take center stage or leave you in the lurch for not trying to decipher that gibberish.  Second, sometimes the young Kvothe is frustrating in his impotence when trying to express his love for his off-and-on girlfriend, and you really think he's a putz, but his obliviousness never strays outside the realm of the believeable.  Third, and possibly the most troubling (but not to me) is that by the end of the book you've done a lot and been on a lot of adventures, but nothing has really brought you noticeably closer to the overarching mystery that is the reason for the story in the first place.  The lore of the Chandrian is doled out in such tiny morsels you really don't know much more at the end than you did at the start.  In this aspect it definitely reads like the first book of a trilogy, but at 750 something pages it had plenty of heft and there's no way they could have trimmed it down without losing the charm and the luxury that I liked so much in the first place.  Make of that what you will.<br /><br />I held out on ordering the second book in the trilogy due to some of the negative reviews, I'll have to grudgingly call them 'haters', that indicated that The Name of the Wind starts losing focus partway, or midway, or most-way through, but I didn't see that to be true at all.  It was really a delightful read all the way through, and I wish I had more time to read more of it at each sitting.  I did indeed order the second book in plenty of time for it to be here waiting for me, and I am anxious to get started on it asap.<br /><br />Bottom line: A definite 5 star book with a nice story in a world you won't mind soaking into for a while.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|After watching the first 2 seasons last month, I caught the Game of Thrones bug.  Knowing that the written version would offer more details about the characters and plot, I bought the 4-Book Bundle.  I am in the final book and will be downloading the fifth book within the week.  It is an enthralling series.
0345495004|4.0|This book was an easy read; It kept my attention. It was a sweet love story that ended not as I anticipated. I would say that it is worth the read.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|This grip is priced right for what it is, a curved piece of plastic.<br /><br />This grip allows a more natural carrying and aiming of a video camera, but that's about it. The base and tripod bolts are cheap and the grip flexes easily. The hotshoe is questionable, and I wouldn't trust the thin plastic strap attachment points with the life of my camera. Not that I've broken one, but there is nothing magic about the strength of this plastic.<br /><br />One Improvement I wish this had is a fold down handle. This grip is an awkward shape and size for storing in a camera bag/backpack.  But being super lightweight is major plus given its squishiness.

159463176X|3.0|I truly loved his first two books especially \\"A Thousand splendid suns\\" so I was eagerly awaiting his third book. The main story is about the siblings Abdullah and Pari, a story which would have been worthwhile to concentrate on, but no the story goes back and fourth between different people, some who have no connection to the main plot. The book feels very disconnected and in some parts lost or people have been added without adding anything to the story. I am sorry to give this book only three stars, but there is no comparison between this book and the first two books!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book was depressing, but that's expected with this type of book.  Not as enlightening as I had expected. Just depressing.

B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Weber does a very good job of making military space action engaging, though he has a tendency to beat up his cast a lot and frequently kills someone you've just started to like.  While it is a good way to make sure readers realize that warfare seldom spares your feelings and interesting people die, I don't consider the genre in general to be in need of that element.  Its a good read however, its difficult to put the book down as one is constantly wondering what will happen next and I found particularly interesting how the opponent empire was rendered in this book with characters that were just as engaging as the lead character.  &#34;The other side&#34; was given plenty of redeeming qualities to where those sections were not skimmed through but were just as engaging to read.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|What a great show! Lots of history on the Eagles I never knew. But it was worth more than the price and a treasure to own.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|These three beginning original Star Wars Movies have been reedited and remastered to provide better viewing entertainment than the previous originals.  They include DTS sound for English, using Dolby Digital for other languages.  The DTS sound is amazing, and far out performs the originals.  The only issues I had was the common dynamic sound being much louder than voice dialogs.  I found myself constantly having to turn the volume down to reduce loud bass sound effects and volume up to hear voice dialogs.  (Probably in an effort to make neighbors also want to watch a Movie, just like the loudness wars with commericials. :-/)<br /><br />I also found the reedited version to include the later Episodes' details to be essential for following a transparent story line between all six episodes or all six Movies.  The only anomaly was the scene of the computer generated Jabba the Hutt talking with Han Solo while walking within STAR WARS V.  Some shadowing or displacement can be seen between real and computer generated video, but over all I still enjoyed the scene.  Jabba the Hutt looked much more real, with a lot more detail.  Additional scenes were also added, providing more background details or better explanations to viewers, further enhancing the story line.<br /><br />Since I use Linux, I had an issue with MPlayer properly decrypting the Blu-ray Movies.  I was able to play and view the Movies using MPlayer, but video started displaying artifacts.  I troubleshooted this to be a result of improper decryption, and had nothing to do with processing power or other hardware issues.  Sadly, I needed to use \\"makemkvcon backup --decrypt disc:/mnt/dvd-udf/ tmp/movie\\" in order to be able to playback the Movie properly and thankfully without any loss of quality as I use a computer HDMI linked (sometimes optical S/PDIF) Yamaha receiver sound system.  A waste of disk space and a waste of energy required for processor and bus power.  As they say, be thankful for what you have, even if it's inadequate.  Blu-ray developers really need to work on this, and remember the innocent are suppose to be sold a product or service, and not leached or swindled for enhancing their own private agenda.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed these Movies and have always enjoyed the director's usage of orchestra music and good talented actors, as well as outgoing special and computer generated effects.  About the only piece of drama I can truly enjoy in life!it's inadequate.

B002CIY8EM|4.0|I like Daniken's ideas, they make sense and he asks some valid questions. However, I would prefer that the answer is also in some form of a question like &#34;Could aliens be responsible for this?&#34;. People should read this book, regardless of their philosophical or religious views, in order to gain another perspective on human evolution and history.
1439181780|5.0|If you liked The Secret you have to get this. Its a floow-up to The Secret just in a easier to understand content. It goes deeper into how to work the secret without all the history, if that makes any sense. Loved it & cant wait to get the next in the seriesThe magic. I'm in a transditional phase & looking at other ways to live a good life & have spirituality this was right up my alley.
B001JI5DRC|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, and it is safe to show to my classes - entertaining and captivating. It uploaded quickly. I would like to add that it is great that you offer the option to rent or buy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|How can you not just love this app?<br />It's great, and for those of you who still may not know what it's for, you can 'pin' recipes, gift ideas, sewing patterns, crochet/knit patterns, party ideas, and more to a 'board' that you can access later.  All of these pins are links to somewhere on the internet that has more description for your pin, or it contains the pattern or recipe.  It's a fancy way to keep bookmarks for websites let's say.  The brilliance of it is in the searching for what you want, and finding just what you need in someone else's pin or board.  There are all sorts of categories too, from gardening, diy and crafts, to humor and celebrities, to guy stuff like cars and geek-y tech.  Fun for everyone!  The app is very user friendly too, just try it!
B0012DT9VK|3.0|Amazon delivers quality movies so fast! I chose this rating because I didn't particularly like the movie. I am a teacher - showed it to my kids and they loved it.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Despite it being uncomfortably violent in some scenes (I get that it helps tell the story), this movie is amazing. The talent of the actors displayed in various roles is genius! Scenery was fantastic. Repetitive human error over the passage of time rings true to current human form.  Very deep. I like the mix of cultures, races, \\"issues\\", generations. Well done.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played dozens of these type games, and I know there are many of you out there just like me. It's for that reason that I always try to leave reviews to help the rest of you out. None of us want to waste our time, or money, on mediocre games, and thankfully this is anything but. I'm a huge fan of Big Fish, and this is, without a doubt, one of their BEST. This is definitely one of my top 3, including games from Alawar and G5.<br />The graphics are superb. It was almost like watching a movie. Some of the characters even keep moving after you interact with them, which added to the &quot;creepiness&quot; factor. Plus, parts of buildings would randomly fall around you, you could touch squirrels and birds and make them run away....it all just added to the overall quality and depth of the game. Also, there were a lot of different locations and screens to keep the game interesting and challenging.<br />The storyline was extremely well executed. There were none of those weird moments where you had to stop and say, &quot;What? That makes no sense whatsoever.&quot; It flowed well and made sense. Plus, it was very creative! Loved how the characters actually spoke to you too.<br />As far as the HO and Mini Games are concerned, there was a good balance. This is especially true if you are a HO fan. The items were hidden well enough to make it challenging, but not too much so (you know how some games have such poor graphics that you can't find items and basically have to randomly touch everywhere and hope for the best...not the case here).The mini games were some of the more challenging ones that I've come across, which was refreshing and fun. Of course, there is a Hint button if you get stuck.<br />I have a Kindle Fire and had no trouble downloading. This is a game that has to download extra content, which takes longer, but is worth it!<br />I also like the fact that this is one of those games that you get to play for a bit before you have to buy it. It allows you to try it out first. I loved it so much, though, that I paid for the full version long before the game asked me to.<br />Had a very enjoyable time playing this. Hated that it ended, and can't wait for the next one!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is a quick read and John Green keeps the reader engaged. My favorite John Green book by far.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a good game to play n the kendal. It is easy and big enough to see the cards really well
B007IK44CK|3.0|This one gets a little more silly then the past episodes in the series. Suspending disbelief was harder than usual. Maybe the fact that Tom Cruise is a bit off balance himself is biasing my opinion more than it use to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|when i first saw the free app for this game wasn't sure what it was but decided to try it anyway and just see if i would like it or not
B000W91RUG|5.0|This was such a fantastic gift to give to anyone! I can only imagine adding more to this! GREAT PICK
B0063GORYU|5.0|game is fun and easy to play on the kendal.I wasn't sure if i would like playing it on my kendal .
B0028BAWU2|5.0|This was such a fantastic gift to give to anyone! I can only imagine adding more to this! GREAT PICK
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is my all time favorite game for kindle simply astonishing and phenomenal five out of five you're missing out on hours over looking this tittle give it a try you will not be disappointed
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Kept my curiosity from page one til the end ,love what the books represents! It's not your normal everyday crap !
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm obsessed with the Tudors. I have watched the entire thing twice so far and will never be sick of it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|The last time we checked, Vampire Weekend was \\"Paul Simon: The College Years\\". (We skipped Contra like we skipped The Godfather 2). However, somewhere along the way V.W. decided to fire Mr. Simon. They are the true Graduates who have evolved from Columbia's AfroPop. They also fired their drummer apparently. However, their third and latest album is excellent. It's the real beginning for V.W., most notably with songs like \\"Unbelievers\\" and \\"Diane Young\\" and \\"Obvious Bicycle\\" and \\"Step\\". It shall be remembered as 2013's great album. As was the case with Mrs. Robinson: The Graduates nailed it.<br /><br />2.342
020530902X|5.0|To put it succinctly, this book was recommended to me by our English faculty at the university I work at as an editor. I had approached them with the question of, &#34;Is it appropriate to use a serial comma in conjunction with an ampersand,&#34; after a faculty member of another department adamantly insisted that a serial comma and an ampersand was wholly and entirely WRONG.<br /><br />While it is not unusual for faculty to have their occasional quirks, this one would have implications that would require lots of editing on my part if it were, in fact, the case, and this book was used to settle the dispute. In the name of politics and diplomacy, we still made some changes to suit the desires of the initial faculty member, but this book has become my go-to resource whenever we have any disputes about formatting that aren't strictly related to aesthetics.<br /><br />Given how inexpensive this book is, there's no reason for anyone NOT to own it, if you work with words with any frequency. Pick it up, it's outstanding!
B009NY43NY|4.0|If you like the other Sookie books, you will like this one as well.  I felt it was better then the last book.  I won't spoil the end, but I was disappointed in the ending.  Everything just wrapped up to quickly in a neat bow.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|Ham on Rye is dark and gritty, taking place from the Great Depression through the attack on Pearl Harbor.  In the days before children were considered the center of the universe, they were sometimes despised, ignored, or even brutalized, as we see in this novel.  Today, we may be overly concerned with &#34;self esteem,&#34; but this novel may show what can happen when there is no concern at all.  The book is not cheery, not happy, doesn't have a gripping plot line, but it's well-written, and there's just something about it that grabs you and won't let you go.  I will remember it.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Movie was better than expected.  Came as a 2-disc package with full movie and a lot of special features.  Great for great price.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Having just seen the season one finale, I can honestly say that this is one of the best series on TV right now.  Probably one of the best new shows to come along since \\"Breaking Bad\\".  If you're sick of \\"mystery\\" shows that frustrate us because they make us wait so long for answers (\\"Lost\\"...), or when you do get the answers it seems like the writers have nothing else to say, then definitely check out this series.  It's been one of the best \\"unfoldings\\" of a mystery I've ever seen in a television show.  The pacing is just perfect.<br /><br />The show has it all: excellent drama, some genuinely disturbing moments, and even some big laughs.  The performance of the lead actress, Tatiana Maslany, is one of the best performances on television, ever.  I honestly don't think any actor has ever been asked to do what she's doing in this show.  She's brilliant.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The movie disc seems fine.  However, the case's plastic was cut open, and the movie cover was ripped a little.  Plus, the movie box itself seems very flimsy.  I give 3 stars because the movie is 5 stars but the case was a 1 star.  My movie could have very easily been damaged.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I remember not really liking the abbreviated (two-hour?) version that came out in the theater. Probably because the characters and plot weren't really properly developed in the short version.<br /><br />I've got a personal interest in the history of the Middle East and Jerusalem.<br /><br />Although Scott takes substantial liberties with the history of the Baldwin dynasty / Queen Sybilla / Saladin et al. he still does a bang-up visual / cinematographic job of recreating a 12th century Jerusalem and outlining the intrigue between the King, the Knights Templar, the church, and the enemies (internal and external) of the Crusaders. Scott also nails the grand themes of the Crusades -- religious motivation vs. economic / political motivation to capture and hold Jerusalem, etc.<br /><br />This DVD should be on anyone's shelf with the Lawrence of Arabia director's cut DVD.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 .I hope they continue making it as good as this season it was fast paced action and a good story. If you don't like bloody shows I don't recommend it to you though and for really young kids it is really too graphic.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Since I like matching games and role playing games, I gave this a try.  This game is fun!  You match up things for points and to get past obstacles.  Don't get too wrapped up in only reacting to what's going on above the board lest you miss out on many, many points.  You use some of the resources collected during play to improve your character's attributes in the dungeon and to extend their longevity in the dungeon.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun to just sit and play while watching Tv or just relaxing. Fun challenging levels that grow with you as you go.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The story manages to stay surprisingly fresh without turning into a grinder.  The characters in the show are complex and the plot pulls you in.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|DEALS WITH THE HISTORICAL RAPE OF INDIAN LANDS BY COLONIALS-REVEALS THE TERRIBLE TRUTHS OF MORALITY SACRIFICED TO POWER OF THE CHURCH-WE ARE STILL SEEING THE AFTER MATH TODAY-MY WIFE IS PERUVIAN AND TRIBES ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR RESTITUCION-PAOLO
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It made me laugh and have a toe tapping good time. The songs were catchy. The ending left you wanting to see more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Feels like it's unfinished. You have to continue to purchase money if you want to accomplish anything. The look isn't bad but game play needs retooled. Not my favorite!
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|The olde expression of \\"The book is always better\\", well it's true. I just watched Beautiful Creatures and it was awful. They slaughtered the entire story. I couldn't believe it. Glad I read the book first
B009NY43NY|2.0|The first few Sookie Stackhouse books were wonderful and I was so eager to finish and wait for the next. Last two were just OK
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved all the suspense and new ideas.  Look forward to the next two books in the trilogy.  Worth the read.
B00BB22GQM|1.0|I bought this because I heard a catchy song or two from the CD on the radio. I was hoping it would be better than the last album along the realm of Vampire Weekend's first album. Unfortunately, the album stinks. It was a struggle to get through the whole thing. I give it one star.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|If only I could set the white noise to play and then have the screen go back to the clock. If you leave the white noise screen, it turns off. Otherwise, the alarm works as expected, and I like seeing the temperature.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this series and can't wait for the next season. We especially love having subtitles; it is worth paying for.
B009NY3CL8|5.0|I remember watching this movie many times growing up.<br /><br />Now I am lucky enough to share this movie with my two little ones who both really enjoyed the movie from start to finish.<br /><br />The all star cast and swashbuckling in the movie will definitely entertain.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Emotional and touching. Should be a required read for students.  It truly helps you see through the eyes of this child.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot.  It is fun.  I am not a cook but I feel like the real thing when I play this!!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|No Angry Birds, for sure.  Had high hopes but was sorely disappointed with Bad Piggies.  Having said that, it is free.
B000000OF6|4.0|Only writing this because required. Good collection item. Not a bad buy if you are still using CDs for some reason.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Amazing real life Cinderella story! We enjoyed every minute of this award winning documentary, plus it has Detroit roots. Highly recommend this Blu-ray.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I started out reading the series and then stopped reading and just watched the show. However about 3 months ago I decided to give the books another go. I'm very happy with this decision because you just get so much more out of the books then the show. I love the characters and am excited to start A Storm of Swords and see where everything/everyone goes!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It was ok, not great had some funny parts in all the action scenes but the plot kinda was a miss for an Arnold movie . Worth a rental not a buy,
B00BI73CVI|3.0|So considering the title this should come as no surprise, the movie was extremely depressing. Very long, but also very well acted out. I did have to take breaks in between as it is a very heavy movie.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This was a slow and uneventful read.  There were several issue's I had with this book and none of them involve who Sookie ends up with.  I'm fine with Sam.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br />Since when can't Barry send a mental signature to Sookie?  She sent one to him across Dallas yet he can't send to her across the yard?  There were so many similar inconsistencies.<br /><br />Carmichael is mad he didn't get the cluviel dor?  He had a free wish from a Demon, instead he had the demon go look for an object that would grant a wish?  Also, all of Sookie's &#34;enemies&#34; had equally weak reasons to hate her.  Poor plot development.<br /><br />The endless trivial Sookie doings were nauseating.  How many times do we have to repeat Sookie showering, lotioning, and her ever changing menu?  Are we trying to highlight how domesticated she is to make her a better mate for Sam?  If you have to change her personality, in the last book of the series, there's something wrong.<br /><br />It's all wrong.  But it's over.
B00A3YTC6Q|4.0|So I'm a pretty decent fan of the Step Up series, but for some reason the lead female character's acting just did not sit well with me. The dancing scenes were epic though, probably the best of all the movies and the music was great.
0679805273|5.0|This book is the book that you should always own.  It is in the company of all classics through time and the message applies to one and all.  Keep this book, read it occassionally, and remember the title for your family and friends when they need a lift.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is my first book from Flynn - it was great read with interesting plot and twists - I really recommend it!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|no stars. This app wouldn't work on my kindle fire hd kept giving and error message.  I deleted the app but it was a free app so no great loss.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|The first two albums were great, the third is no different.  Every song on the album is great!  This was worth the wait.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There were a few twists and turns which I liked. Overall a great book. I would recommend it for people to read
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Streamed beutifully on PS3 without a problem or hiccup.  Worked flawlessly As for the movie it was amazing Ben Kingsley great performance.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|They are right.  That this family all survived a horrible event seems &#34;impossible&#34;.  The opeing scenes with their contrast of pure paradise and pure hell are spellbinding.  I loved this movie!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Both free and paid versions are wonderful!  The loops are seamless, making these very nice to listen to!  Thanks for great apps!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|My husband and I were looking forward to watching this movie as all of the movies we had watched with Tom Hanks starring in them were superb.  Not so with this one.  Although his acting skills were beyond reproach, the plot was difficult to follow from the beginning and the language used was not Tom Hanks' level.  The ending was also anticlimactic.  We were very disappointed.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|the wire in the charger I had must have come lose in the one I had,so I looked at the comments on some other chargers( they can scare you) and then got what I thought would be the best one. I was right i did get the best one for me, and I am back in action. I can read and go on line again on my kindle  I am happy again
B00BESKTMG|2.0|The final action was just in slow motion.  Nothing really exciting.  The movie was overall boring.  Two stars from me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I could not put this game down! As a huge fan of the Myst series, this game filled a gaming void I have had since the Myst series finished. Fantastic game play, seamless transitions, enticing puzzles, and vivid images make this a truly remarkable app. I cannot wait for any follow ups. I would pay to have an extended version on my PS3 if the quality remained the same.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I gave this book the highest rating because it has things to please everyone like romance, forbidden love, great characters, and action. This is not the first time I have read this book and will not be the last:)
B009JZVT70|5.0|This show is so exciting with twists in every episode. The quality of the episodes is great!! I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of the season!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Hard to stop reading.  Thoroughly entertaining lots of new twists can't wait for the next book.  I can only guess at the outcomes
B000PXUA5W|5.0|The band was easily adjustable and bore the standard clock arms like we wanted. The only issue was he felt it unsnapped easier than he wanted. Great watch overall!
B005EHILV4|4.0|Good for recording acoustic music because there's no point in paying a bunch of money for a mixer with a million knobs and all you're going to do is record and maybe adjust reverb. It also has a link to the behringer site that has all kinds of free VST plugins and instrument plugins to download for whatever audio software you are using.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game never really messes up or suddenly pauses.It's also a good game.One thing though is that you have to earn all the characters and some of them are like nine hundred thousand coins.It's still good though.
B007XF0X6G|4.0|A really fun film for fans of the Claymation films of the '50s. CG I is much more capable of recreating reality, or redefining it. I thank my lucky stars every day for having had the opportunity to work in the Video Game Industry back in the '90s and early 2Ks. It gave em a great deal of insight into the 'how to' of CGI. That knowledge makes me even more appreciative of what's being done to entertain us. Buy the film, enjoy the film, it's FUN! Nothing is meant to be historically accurate except perhaps the architecture, and the clothing. Enjoy the movie, make popcorn.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This is really a YA book with some attempt at foul language and adult issues thrown in.  Only got through half of it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Make more books<br />Jeff  your the best<br />Maybe Greg kisses some one or dates someone<br />Please make Another book $$$ !!!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|if you like quell be prepared for a new adventure- fun and similar yet different and more interactive game enjoy playing all 3 games
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It as the best dictionary EVER. I used it for my homework and spellings and lots of other things.<br /><br />  AWESOME
B006OOHYIC|4.0|this game is fun if you like quell but not as good as quell memento, it is very similar to the original game
B004HD61KE|2.0|Good writing skill, but written too long by half. It seemed the author's target audience was Hollywood, rather than the reading public. Too many literary artifices and cliches.  I found myself rolling my eyes a number of times during the read, due to the number of ridiculous plot manipulations.<br /><br />I read the book all the way through it to its predictable end (sunshine and flowers, mom and apple pie, but with the boogie man just over the next horizon).  However, this author won't get me to buy his dross again.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I don't know if it is because this is for a Kindle, but there are just not enough layouts and to get more you must buy the next level.  But I do have to admit that for .99 it's not a bad deal.
B0099114WO|2.0|i really was in the mood for a great or ever 'good' movie as Meryl never disappoints but there just wasnt much here to work with. the first 30 mins (i looked) nothing happened. then the next 30 they worked up to 'touch' i think then the last was just an ending to wrap the movie up with nothing i would think to ever watch this movie again for. i bought it at a blockbuster closing for .99 and will b taking it to the used dvd store for a 3.00 credit but sure glad i didnt spend 20.00 for it or anything. ck out 'its complicated' which was so much better.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Completely useless, won't accept username or password.  No support, only forum. One star because you can't go with no stars.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|The entire book was well done and contained a lot of useful information for both new and experienced presenters. TED info is all the rage and this book provides an excellent view.
193700788X|1.0|I truly wish I had not read this final book so I could just fantasize my own ending.  This boring ending of the series has tainted the works as a whole.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is really fun. it's great for all ages! definately download this app! you will not be disappointed. :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|I've played several city builds type games and so far this is ranking pretty high on my list :). But I would like to see some improvements for this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is really unpredictable. If you haven't read it, read it!<br /><br />If you like this book, try The Space Olympics, which is sorta like this book. An 11-year old named Julie Leary puts herself in the Space Olympics and nearly gets killed. That's all to say, so buy it!
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|Downloaded its even clearer then the dvd. This timeless classic is a must have for anyone<br />even if you do not celebrate Christmas.. its must classic in black and white<br />A movie that makes you feel good no matter how many years go by
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love demille sarcasm and he provides plenty. It feels like I am there, IN Yemen with the characters. Please continue to write more John Corey adventures.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Will not reward Disney by paying more for less. No Blu Ray disc for 31.00? I own a 3D player and 3D TV but will not be buying this title. No thanks Disney. Walt must be spinning in his grave.[[ASIN:B00C7JG0KG Oz the Great and Powerful (Blu-ray 3D + Digital Copy)]]
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|I wonder what the individual/s that wrote this were smoking. The aberations from reality are endless. Melodrama at its worst.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Don't know how I missed this movie when it came out in the theatres. Sorry about the sadness and truth of the subject matter; neverthelesd, very well presented. Thanks for telling this story that needed to be told.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|Great music from beginning to end.  The songs get in your head and you don't even want to get them out.  Only regret that I never realized how ridiculously talented Tom Keifer is back in the day.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|If you want entertainment; here's a movie for you. Fun, silly movie.  It has entertainment value when you are bored or just want some silliness in your day.
B00CTT9646|4.0|All the One-Stars must be hardcore Trekkies. They, no matter what, were not going to like this film. I grew up watching Star Trek and think the last two films were very well done, so much better then the other Star Trek Movies with Shatner and Company. I've seen the film twice, once in 2D and the other at Imax 3D. Both were visually stunning. However, the \\"light flares\\" are a bit distracting. This was a very good movie and it is going into my meager collection.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am such a fan of this program and the last episode left me CRAVING for answers for the next season.  This is quite a show.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I truly concur with the majority of the writing in this book regarding wheat causing many of the health issues faced by people today.  The problem as I see it thought is that very few people will actually try a diet void of wheat because it is found in so many products.  However, I was diagnosed with food allergies 5+ years ago and was forced to omit wheat from my diet and have now found a new way of eating with greatly improved health.  I challenge people to read with an open mind taking into consideration the benefits that can result in a healthier lifestyle.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Watching Bones on tv, I was interested in another story about Brennan.<br />I like a little fact with my stories.<br />I would recommend this book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have tried several calculator apps. This one has a clean appearance and works very well. For $0.99, one can't go wrong.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's better than my MS computer calculator 'cause I can take it with me. I like the big numbers, too.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Many people are blind to the fact that black arms trades are happening world wide.  Great film! As always Nicolas Cage challenges his audience to think outside the box!

B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|It was challenging but I was not gratified by the ending. There was not a very good storyline to what was going on.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Really liked the movie and Cruise was awesome and very entertaining.  Nice there was a movie without all the foul language and sex
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|With Marvel doing all their superheros, this was a refreshing take on the whole superhero type of movie.  With great effects, amazing directing, and acting top notch, I've ended up watching this one many times.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Wow. Where do I begin with this one? I absolutely loved Christian Grey in 50 Shades of Grey however I can honestly say that Gideon Cross has definitely bumped him down my book hero listing. I was skeptical when I read the blurbs on this series and thought, mmmm, maybe give it a miss. But I kept going back to the blurbs on Amazon and decided to download them. I am so glad that I did. Talk about hot!<br />I was wrapped up in these books from the time I started reading and could not put them down. I forgot about family and work and stayed up so late that I could put matchsticks in my eyes to hold them up.<br />This is one messed up couple however they work together to get their lives in order with a hell of a lot of missteps and hurdles along the way. More than a normal couple but fitting for the story. I was feeling anxious myself just reading about them. It¡¦s not a complete dominant/submissive book but it has the same lines. The book is very raw and at times quite animalistic.<br />Gideon Cross is one super, alpha man with a side of totally dirty. And he is rich and successful also. Who could turn that down? The first question out of his mouth to Eva is enough to sucker punch you into this story. And it just goes from there. To be so devoured by someone like him would turn anyone on!<br />The sex scenes are rich in description and details that will make you blush! I liked the story line also that went with this series. Some might find it not enough and maybe a bit over the top but overall for me I enjoyed the complete package.<br />So I will be forever crushing on Gideon Gross (fantastic name by the way) Now if only I could find my own Gideon I would be in total heaven º
B0040GURF8|5.0|What a deal! John Mayer at his blues busting best. And 22 live tracks! How can that be for $6.99? I ain't complaining.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Huffington Post is an aggregator of news articles with a liberal slant.  The Huffpo covers many other topics too, from entertainment to style and weird news.  This is a daily must read for me.
B004JNB4UO|4.0|Having been teen age during WWII, Navy in Philippines during Korea and visiting Corregidor in 2008, this was an interesting addition to my history videos.  I would have wished for more background on General Douglas McArthur but feel the time covered, from early Japanese invasion to the Generals retirement added much to my knowledge and understanding.  The insights to the forced departure, difficulty in making good on his promise to return, Japanese desire to insure non-military position, the Generals input to the new constitution were all very enlightening.  Shows McArthur was not just a military man but far sighted administrator as well.  There was no evidence that this movie received any awards.  However, in my view the color, acting and sound were all I could hope for.  Battle sequences were brief but the locations were authentic in my view and I have landed or traveled to many sites in the movie.  Video was received from Amazon in a timely manner as promised and I am well pleased with my purchase.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't usually go for this type of game, not really much of a gamer at all really, but I loved this game. My only complaint is that it ended. I will be watching for more of this game
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series. Patiently waiting for the next! Well written. Looking forward to reading more of Sylvia Day's novels.
B00BI745AA|1.0|My Husband and I decided to rent this movie on Sunday night and were so disappointed we turned it off after an hour.<br />The film itself is beautiful. However, the songs slow down an already slow and dark movie. We didn't feel that it &#34;worked&#34; on the screen the way that the same story works on the stage. Sad waste of money. We rarely stop movies. Too long. Russell Crowe is almost comical in his portrayal. I hope you enjoy it more than we did.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is perfect in every way left me in tears. I could not put the book down and proceeded to finish it in one day. Thank you for writing this book.

B004UID2LC|4.0|I downloaded this to try out because it was free.  I'm rating it 4 stars because I really like it so far but haven't used it enough to move it to 5 stars yet.  It works fine for downloading videos to my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is one you'd take with you if you wanted to have something to read on the beach. It's not really involved or difficult to read. It's very light and something not to be taken too seriously. If you have the mindset that it's going to be a very shallow, easy, breezy read, you'll probably enjoy it than expecting it to be something more.
B009POCG2C|3.0|I had wanted to see this movie when it was out in theaters but I missed it there.  Strike one.<br />I thought this would make a good date movie for me and my wife when it hit the second-ran theater but I still missed it.  Strike two.<br />I was at a friends and saw he had it on DVD and his family liked the flick and let me borrow it (freebie).  Swing and connected!<br />Watching at liesure soon after with my wife within the first 20\\" of this cinematic game I knew exactly how it was going to play out and I was grateful that I hadn't wasted any moolah on it.  Out at first!<br /><br />This film is pretty pedestrian; it goes by the numbers.  You have the story of a revered but aging out of the game scout (played by Clint Eastwood, all gruff and no substance) who is suffering an eye malady and who is never in the office to battle the young statistic crunchers who want to push him out of his job.  You have the story of his daughter (played by Amy Adams doing her best to raise the emotinal bar of this film but generally failing), physically and emotionally abandoned by her father, but still loyal to him and with a driving internal ache to still be daddy's little girl.  You have the romantic love interest (played by Justin Timberlake who isn't given much to do and does alright) who has a strong tie to the daughter's father and who could be easily manipulated to give them what they want...<br /><br />Okay I tried not to spoil anything but if you can't see where this is all going then maybe you'll dig on this movie like some other people have.  What was worse for me than the simple see-the-pitch coming storyline was how utterly one-note all of these characters were (and the ball player making a name for himself with his bat was simply the worst; it's as if the movie was sticking in a cue card that read \\"DON'T LIKE THIS GUY, AUDIENCE!  HE'S A JERKWAD!\\").  The performances (excepting John Goodman who offered empathy and vulnerability) were either dull (Adams), wooden (Eastwood, I know he was going for gruff but that was ridiculous), or stiff (all of the extras; and I mean all of them).  It makes me wonder if director Robert Lorenz knows what an emotion is outside of a high school play (yeah, yeah, I know I shouldn't knock high school plays...).<br /><br />Trouble With The Curve has trouble of its own finding nuanced emotional beats and avoiding heavy foreshadowing.  I can't help but believe that otherwise good actors were hampered by a faulty script and directing.  It turned out to be like watching a boring baseball game where nothing ever really gets going, absent a pitcher's duel.  Watchable I suppose, but just barely.  2.5 stars.I know he was going for gruff but that was ridiculous), or stiff (all of the extras; and I mean all of them).

0486278077|5.0|This is a great story about vanity and self obsession. I loved this novel, it is a page turner. The story moves at a quick pace, it does not drag as classic novels often can. Oscar Wilde is my favorite author, and this is a great example of why.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Prior to release Riverside gave clues to what their new album was going to be driven by: SONGS (or \\"S.hrine O.f N.ew G.eneration S.laves\\").  Have their other releases not been about the songs?  Of course they have but given their progressive rock/ metal vein they certainly usually wouldn't be described as radio friendly.  And that's where we find perhaps the most significant difference on SONGS: the narrative structure and tone (not nearly as heavy and usually not as dense) lends itself to a more...approachable, accessible sound.  Anyone who tells you this is pop has got it wrong but one thing rings true and that is that despite the lyrical content the emotions in the music are lighter, subtler than in previous outings (where it was pretty dark) and thereby perhaps more listenable to a wider audience.<br /><br />Does this album offer up some smart rock?  Yes.  Does it blister the ears or burn at the back of your mind?  Not usually.  The emphasis has been placed on the melody in most of these numbers (excepting disc 2 which is about mood).  While I have really liked their previous efforts and the all out prog-rock ecstasy of ADHD makes me thrill with delight SONGS instead feels just right.  They aren't putting music in to fill gaps or experimenting for experimentation's sake or including a blistering guitar solo because there hasn't been one in a while or the album needs a certain quotient.  They offer a narrative, a story about how a person can be swallowed up in society and a relationship and be a zombie (familiar themes for this band), and they structure the story as if you are taking the journey with the protagonist as they move throughout a day in their life (and here I would argue that disc 2 that sports two songs, \\"Night Sessions-Part One\\" and \\"Night Sessions-Part Two\\", is really like completing the fullness of this character's 24 hour day where they begin with sleep and move to awake--\\"Night Sessions-Part One\\"--and then end their day by falling back to sleep before starting the cycle over--\\"Night Sessions-Part Two\\").  The music supports the narrative and fills it out.<br /><br />Duda's vocals, sublime at times, are also much more present throughout.  This guy's got a great sympathetic voice.  The guitar is frequently a support player within the songs with rhythym and keys being the primary drivers.  As I have loved their guitar work previously I might have initially been a little disappointed as this is one of my \\"guitar bands\\" but as I have listened to this album many, many, many times over I love the overall effect and the subtleties that abound throughout the songs.  There is a great amount of diversity here and Riverside even gives us a song, smack in the middle of the album (\\"Feel Like Falling\\"), that has an uplifting emotional quality and energy.<br /><br />I can't say that I love this album more than ADHD or Second Life Syndrome; it is simply too different from either of those to rate a fair comparison.  I can say that I love it, and perhaps at that just as much.<br /><br />For those who didn't like Riverside previously, this album could change their mind (mind you, not disc 2).  For those who loved them previously, Riverside has given us a new form to follow.  Some will not like it, and some of us will find yet another musical gem and be moved by the power of an intelligent and cohesive musical approach, which is what I feel that we have on Shrine.  A very sure 5 stars.  Shrine on, Riverside, shine on.before starting the cycle over--\\"Night Sessions-Part Two\\").

1612930425|3.0|I am a huge fan of classic literature, though I find this novel to be dry and slow moving. Another reviewer called this \\"the dry version of love\\", and I don't think I could have worded it better myself. I enjoy a good love story and I feel that is what this story lacks. I did not feel moved by the story at all as I usually am with a love story. It all feels very proper and mechanical. Another aspect about this novel I did not enjoy was the language. I am aware that many find Austen's use of language beautiful and expressive, but I just find it over the top. It feels like each character's words could be condensed down to half of what is used. I found myself scanning much of the dialogue rather than fully reading every word written. To me, this dialogue slowed down the rate of the story and I just wanted the story to move on at a much quicker pace. Despite this, I did not entirely dislike this novel. I found it to be an interesting insight into the customs of the time. One of the novel's central themes is the classes that divided people from one another. One aspect I felt that Austen did well was character development for both Elizabeth and Jane. I really felt that I had a clear understanding of them and their motives, though that can not be said for all of the characters. I am glad that I read the story, but I do not see myself re-reading it any time soon. I would recommend this for those who enjoy classic literature, but I would not recommend this to someone looking for a great love story.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The acting is incredible by all the actors.  To be able to act 2 different personalities is awesome.  I just wish the fifth season would have been a &#34;prime member&#34; freebie.

B0091W7K6K|5.0|I can't believe how long I waited to see this.  Great car chase, Steve Mcqueen is a super star.  Awesome movie.
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|I had heard this was a good movie, but its a waste of time & money. My husband & I slept through most of it after the first 45 min. The writing was boring, Arnold is really showing his age unfortunately, although he was the best actor in this movie. Lots of needless blood & gore. Save your money for a good movie.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Bought for a Canon 6D. The configurable inside is just what I needed, since I needed to store some accessories. Padded well, looks built well. We'll see how it holds up, but I do not foresee any problems.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This was a good movie. Its a typical Tom Cruise movie where he is the big hero/bad boy. Good action & suspense. Definetly worth the rental.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It made me felt for the characters and wish that the real-life characters were able to have gotten more credit closer to the time of the event. I learned a lot, and I was happy I purchased the movie.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was skeptical about this series when I heard about it. As I started watching it, I recognized that it was a _Batman_ rip off (which was by design; the original _Green Arrow_ comic book was meant to be very similar to _Batman_). But I got really hooked into the story, which you view from two different time perspectives at once via frequent flashbacks to the time the hero spent on the island. There are cliffhangers at the end of almost every episode, which makes it easy to sit and burn through a large chunk of the season at once. If it were a book, it would really be a page turner. Despite some of the overacting (which I think is intentional), I enjoy the characters. I'd definitely recommend the show.
1400069807|4.0|This book was a good read.  It really went into detail about the inner workings of the food industry and its history.<br /><br />With that said, I kept waiting for one big \\"aha\\" moment or reveal, but it never came.  The book simply lays out the way things are and why food companies do what they do.<br /><br />Overall, I found In Defense of Food the better overall book regarding the American diet, its pitfalls, and how we can overcome it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|There are no fancy bells or whistles to this game, it's just good old fashioned solitaire.  I like it, because it's quick to play a game, quick to re-deal.  It doesn't take lots of time or memory - it's just a great way to play solitaire.
