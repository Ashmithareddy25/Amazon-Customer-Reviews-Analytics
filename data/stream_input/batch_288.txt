B00005K3LU|5.0|Like \\"The Matrix\\", this movie divides the history of film into a \\"pre\\" and a \\"post\\" era. The action films of the post-\\"Die Hard\\" era are different than those before. It influences nearly every summer action blockbuster to this very day. Sorta like how elements of \\"The Matrix\\" infuse everything from commercials to cartoons.<BR> All movies of this genre are elevated by their criminal. The better the bad guy, the better the film. Alan Rickman, as Hans Gruber, is on the short list of \\"best bad guys ever\\" . Every line is a high point, every glance or arched eye brow tells another piece of the story.<BR>The music, deftly weaving Christmas motifs into exemplary Hollywood action fanfare, couldn't be any better. The sound design is spot on.<BR>McTiernan's direction is precise and efficient. Everything is clearly and excitingly told, at a pace that leaves you breathless. <BR>This DVD looks razor sharp...best transfer yet.<BR>The extras aren't as neato-torpedo as I'd hoped...a documentary on such an influential flick seems a given...but they will occupy you for a while.<BR>A final word about Bruce Willis.  This is one of those films where a character and an actor are perfectly matched. As John McClane, he is most definitely perfect. Nobody could have done it better.<BR>Yippee-ki-ay indeed.

B00006RCNW|5.0|After much hype by FX, the Shield debuted on cable television last year.  It quickly became a hit, with its gritty and controversial characters, top-notch writing, and superb acting.  There have been many attempts to do police dramas, but the Shield elevates the bar.  With Michael Chiklis plays the lead role of Vic Mackey, the leader of a special strike team that does things in legal and not so legal ways at times to get the job done.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of the show is wondering what Vic will do next.  He does some questionable things at times, but you can't help root for him and his team.  With a Captain out to expose Mackey for the \\"dirty\\" cop that he is, every episode has you hooked and eagerly anticipating the next.  Rounding out the superb cast, is the mentioned Captain, two detectives that get to solve many interesting cases, and two patrol officers, one a female training officer teaching the job to a new rookie.  Intertwining them all is expertly done, and each actor knows their character so well, that you can feel it each time they speak.<br />The Shield pushes the limits of what can be shown on TV, though not as blatant as the Sopranos (which has to be shown on HBO), it has it's share of swearing and some brief partial nudity, as well as dealing with subject matter that is not for the kids.  It's about time that a police drama is shown this way.  NYPD Blue touched on this, but The Shield in the first season manages to take it up a notch.<br />The DVD set of the first season includes 4 discs containing the 13 episodes of season one, and includes a making of documentary and commentary on the episodes.  Video quality is fairly good, but at times some artifacts are present.  All in all, a good set and the quality of the show itself makes this set shine brightly. An award winning show with an Emmy and two Golden Globes (best Drama series and Michael Chiklis, Best actor Drama), you can't go wrong here.

0898705525|5.0|I really liked this book, but to recommend something without discretion is not always wise.<br />I would recommend this book to the person who feels poisoned by the eminent despair and boredom of modern thinking.<br />Secondly, I would recommend it to the thoughtful and sincere agnostic as an aid in his or her efforts in searching for the answer.<br />Lastly, I would recommend it to the thoughtful Christian (and I would like to encourage all fellow Christians to be thoughtful).<br />I feel that I should also note this: Chesterton was not concerned so much with elaborate arguments and defenses of Christian faith when he wrote this book, rather it is a challenge to our basic assumptions upon which the vast majority of our arguments lie.
006092988X|5.0|It's quite sad that someone with limited spelling and vocabulary felt the need to write three separate reviews against this book, merely changing the order of the complaint.  Clearly, s/he didn't understand it.  This book does not merely discuss the fact that Francie had a rough life that she managed to overcome; remember, as she and Neeley discussed the future after their mother remarried, they reminded each other how much fun it had all been along the way.  Francie's struggles, analogous to the tree of the title, are what stimulated her young mind.  Smith's writing so crisply describes tenement life, but she also gives Francie the credit for making crucial decisions along the way (changing schools, for example), rather than depending on others to think for her.  My mother tried to get me to read this book for years, but it is not a book for young children--it took adulthood for me to truly appreciate this wonderful, heartfelt book.
0679736646|5.0|I hate to admit this but after finishing Ubik I have no idea what point Philip K. Dick was making with the conclusion of this story.  (Though I've since then learned that he himself considered it one of his most important works.)   <br />Ubik contains many very interesting developments and some tangents you know no one but Philip K. Dick would explore.   My favorites include the idea that death can be defeated entirely and society may someday spin the pay-per-view mentality ridiculously out of control.  Written in 1969, Ubik is just another example of Mr. Dick's advanced insight.  <br />There is suspense right up until the end, and the hope of finally understanding \\"what's really going on\\" is tantalizing; if only I understood the ending this would be one of my favorites.  <br />As always, reading any Philip K. Dick novel is truly an eye-opening and unique experience.  If you like them hilarious and bizarre, you'll enjoy reading Ubik much more than once.

With that said, before publishing my own relationship book. &quot;From the First Date to the Bedroom--The Single Man's Guide to Success With Women&quot; I will admit that I read and learned a great deal from Mr. Gray.
B00005MP58|4.0|this movie blew me away. the screenplay and the book are almost identical so you know you are getting the real thing. the acting was also superb. the reason i didn't give it five stars is because the color quality of the dvd is not as good as it was on tv when it was aired. it is much &quot;grayer&quot;. also, they don't have optional subtitles in the special features. i hope they come out with a better one. i would willingly buy another copy if it was improved.

B000000WA4|5.0|In 2025, our society will remember this band - much like we remember the great rock bands from the 70's, such as Floyd and Zeppelin. Only then, we will refer to them as &quot;the Pumpkins&quot;. Two albums will always be quoted as their finest pieces: 'Siamese Dream' &amp; 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'. Floyd gave us 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wall', Zeppelin gave us 'Physical Graffiti' and 'ZOFO (LED ZEPPELIN IV)', and the Pumpkins gave us their masterpieces. But it is 'Mellon Collie' that will be most embraced - selling over 8 million copies is a great task for a double CD to accomplish. This CD is as amazing as it is captivating, brilliant as it is dark, and somber as it is joyous. The amazing piano-driven ballad sets the tone for the first disc 'Dawn to Dusk' which produces some of the Pumpkins finest work - Muzzle, Zero, Here is no why, Jellybelly, Porcelina, and tonight tonight. The mood begins to change as you pop in the second disc, much like a sunset giving in to a brilliant moonlit night, which is what the face of the CD suggests. This is truly an ALBUM - making it part of any music collection is essential.
B00000K0E5|5.0|It had been six long years since the viewing public had witnessed a new adventure in the life of secret agent James Bond. And believe me, 1989's \\"Licence To Kill\\" wasn't the greatest Bond film to leave the audience with. The series was rejuvenated with the casting of Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. It was a perfect, natural fit. Who else?. Brosnan's introduction to the role of Bond is easily the best since we were all first introduced to him, via Sean Connery, in 1962's \\"Dr. No\\". I liked Roger Moore, but Pierce has been the only Bond in the franchise to match Connery. This film, released in the winter of 1995, was a return to a more serious 007 film. It worked. It was easily the best new 007 movie since \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" in 1977, even though that was a fantasy driven entry. Here's the plot of the film. Bond learns that his fellow agent, Agent 006, Alec Trevelyan(Sean Bean), has faked his death in the opening teaser of the film, and is now the head of Janus, which is a Russian arms trading list. Alec plans to rob British banks through hacking into their systems by using a Goldeneye satellite to fire a magnetic ray over London that will wipe out all of the banks' records. Pretty nifty plan. Definitley the best villainous plan since Goldfinger's attack on Fort Knox. The women has the usual Bond women. There is Natalya Simonova(Izabella Scorupco), who is a Russian programmer that ends up with Bond after surviving a massacre where she worked. The most interesting is Xena Onatopp(Famke Janssen). She kills her victims by crushing them to death with her thighs. What a way to go. Bond is aided by an American CIA agent named Jack Wade, played by Joe Don Baker. For those of you who didn't know, Baker also played the villain Brad Whitaker in \\"The Living Daylights\\". We are also introduced to Valentin Zukovsky(Robbie Coltrane), a Russian crime boss who was once shot by 007, who becomes an ally for Bond. We see him again in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\". The action scenes are executed perfectly, and are spaced just right. They are all believeable and not over the top. This is something that was upped by a large margin in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", but was done well. Brosnan. How can I say it?. He is James Bond. He seemed comfortable and self assured in the role right from the very first frame. This is something that Timothy Dalton never seemed to be. It's a good thing he was replaced. I loved Roger Moore, but Brosnan is a bit tougher and stronger. Moore seemed too nice and clean to be an agent with a licence to kill. Pierce and Brosnan are alike. We also learn in this new film that 007's boss, M, is now a woman. She is played by the incredibly talented Dame Judi Dench. It was a nice new twist to the old formula for the new era of Bond films. \\"Goldeneye\\" is every Bond fan's dream of a classic Bond film.
B00000K0EA|5.0|After a tremendous rebirth of the James Bond franchise with \\"Goldeneye\\" in 1995, the series was back on a roll with the best Bond since Connery. While \\"Goldeneye\\" seemed like a classic Bond film that was a bit more serious, this one seemed to revert to other Bond films that relied on a silly storyline and over the top action. Good for us. In my opinion, those were always the most fun and entertaining of the 007 films, and this one is no exception. Pierce Brosnan returns to the role that seemed tailor made for him. He is so good and right for Bond, that you immediatley think of him as Bond and not as the 'new guy'. As for the plot of the film, well, it's silly, but here is what this Bond film serves up. The main villain is Elliot Carver(played very nicely by Jonathan Pryce), who is a megalomaniac man behind the Carver Media Group, who own satellites that are used to launch his own television news network that can be seen all over the world. Carver plans to start World War III between the UK and China, which would propel Carver's broadcasting rights into China. Okay. Bond meets up with two women in this latest adventure. Carver's wife Paris(played by Teri Hatcher), who was a former lover of Bond's, and agent Wai Lin(Michelle Yeoh), who works for China's security force. Pryce is a great villain. He definitley looks like the evil business megalomaniac with his standing white hair, and wire rimmed glasses. He is an enigmatic presence to watch. Too bad he isn't given more to do than punch buttons on his keypad. Not much is made of the Paris role, but she does give Bond some information. It's a pity Hatcher didn't have a better role. Yeoh is a [awesome] actress who can hold her own against Bond. It's tough to decide who is better at it, her or Hallee Berry. This entry is a real testosterone, action packed film. It seems to be non stop action and it never lets up. It's a great thrill ride that is made so fun and entertaining because of the wonderful eye of director Roger Spottiswoode. Some people complain that the 007 films are not action packed films. Some long for the days of the 60's with Bond doing his investigating with a mild action scene here and there. That was all great. For the day. Nowadays, I think it would be somewhat boring for the audience. Keep in mind that this is the era where we have \\"XXX\\" and other CGI fueled blow 'em ups. I'm not saying Bond needs to be that way, but we do need a bit more excitement in these modern times Bond films than just 007 wearing cool suits and golfing with the villain. I love it, but not for today's times. Great character actor Vincent Schiavelli also pops up as an intriguing character named Dr. Kaufman. It would of been great if his role was bigger, because he is fun to watch and has a bit of comedy in his all too brief scene. Another familiar face, CIA agent Jack Wade, played by veteran actor Joe Don Baker, also returns. He was first introduced in \\"Goldeneye\\". The main theme song here is okay. It was done by Sheryl Crow, and it isn't one of the better songs from the recent films. It's alright, but it doesn't hold your interest much. The main title design isn't one of the best either. All in all, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is a rip roaring piece of action packed entertainment that is destined to please any viewer. Nobody does it better than James Bond.
B000066AXC|4.0|This is typical Hollywood schlock: a heartwarming story that just screams &quot;OSCAR!&quot;<br />However... did you know that John Nash was bisexual?  That he divorced his wife in 1963 and fathered a child out of wedlock?  That his son was also a schizophrenic and gifted mathematician, but spent most of his life in institutions?<br />It seems as if content and the true story of Nash's life was spared to keep a PG-13 rating and the voters of the Academy Awards feeling warm and fuzzy.  Admittedly, though, this movie does a good job of doing what it's supposed to: making its viewers leave the theater happy and as if they just viewed a work of art about a man with a &quot;beautiful mind,&quot; regardless of how inaccurately that mind was portrayed.<br />I liked this movie as a typical Hollywood movie, but not as a biopic of John Nash's life.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is a great rock n' roll record.  The Strokes are an amazing garage rock band, with catchy vocals, catchy guitars and relatively simple, fast drum beats.  Every song is equally as awesome as the last, and although the album is fairly short it makes up for it by being the perfect rock record.
0609610570|2.0|I guess after reading From Good to Great, I read this book, and it was a major disappointment.  Where Good to Great gave you data and a ton of great examples from many companies, this book gave you their personal examples, and no data.  If you are in the top two bands at a Fortune 100 business, this might help.  But for the rest of us, I would recommend other books.<br />Also, for those who are looking for a roadmap, this book does not have it.  It provides very general guidance.
6301934229|4.0|The Hitcher starts off promising, although exactly as you'd expect it would based on the title and the cover.  It's a rainy night on a highway in the middle of a desert.  Our main character falls asleep for a few moments at the wheel of his car, and almost crashes into the front of a tractor-trailer.  Realizing he needs something other than the radio to help keep him awake he picks up a hitchhiker on the side of the road.  The hitcher doesn't say much at first, but as they pass a broken down car the hitcher is quick to admit that he killed its driver by cutting off all of his limbs.  Then he pulls out a knife, but our hero manages to narrowly escape.<BR>  The rest of the movie follows our hero as he gets set-up by the hitcher and wanted by the police for murders that he didn't commit.  And naturally it all ends with a showdown between him and the hitcher.<BR>  A good thriller but it gets rather boring in the middle with the exception of a good car chase or two.
B00007E8V4|5.0|There are people who have said, that is it, they can't do any thing new, System has done all they can. Then they get slapped in the face with this CD...The design is stripped and the packaging is bare, making their message of conform and die all the more clear. More incredible guitar riffs and bass lines drive this album to places unseen. and Serj's  vocals are unlike any other...the So called \\"Nu-metal\\" genre may be fading but System will be around for along time to come.
B00005NOOH|5.0|I first watched this series as a teenager, back in the mid-late 70's. I was riveted to the screen then, as I am once again riveted today.

B000063DHL|4.0|This CD suffered a brutal improvement with this remastered / enhanced version, when comparing it to its original CD release. The songs are more crips, the bass line and drums more hard, the difference is breathtaking.<br />This album is surely a little forgotten by Maiden fans (like POWERAGE for AC/DC, for instance), but, in both cases, they are terrific albums.<br />I enjoy all the eight songs here, I think none of them are filler (contrary to the Maiden releases of the nineties, that were chock full of fillers). GREAT ALBUM.
B000067CQK|3.0|The little tiny three-note guitar lick at the very end of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; -- the one *right* before &quot;Suffragette City&quot; crashes in -- has been faded out, so that the two songs no longer flow continuously one into the other. I can't imagine why this was done.<br />I can't understand WHY THEY CAN'T PRODUCE THIS SPECIAL CD TO REFLECT THE ORIGINAL ALBUM!!  <BR>The small nuances give the recording life...

0553801511|5.0|The Golden Fool is the second novel in the Tawny Man series, following Fool's Errand. In the previous volume, FitzChivalry Farseer pretended to be Lord Golden's servant while they try to recover Prince Dutiful from a band of Piebald kidnappers led by Laudwine. They met a number of the Witted and learned much about the dangers facing the Old Blood. Eventually, they are found by the kidnappers and confined with the Prince. They discovered that Dutiful's cat is possessed by a dead woman. Fitz killed the cat at its own request and, when Laudwine attacks him, cut off the Piebald leader's forearm. Fitz held off the Piebalds until the Old Bloods rescue them. Fitz's wolf, Nighteyes, was wounded and died soon thereafter. As the Prince mourned his cat and Fitz mourned Nighteyes, they returned with the Fool to Buckkeep castle.<br />In this novel, Fitz is still pretending to be Tom Badgerlock, Lord Golden's servant. The Piebalds have found him again and have left reminders of their presence.  Fitz reluctantly agrees to teach Prince Dutiful the Skill and soon has other students.  Dutiful remains friends with Civil, despite evident complicity of the Bresinga family in the Piebalds kidnapping plot.  Laurel, the Queen's Huntswoman, also is getting hints from Piebald agents.  The Piebalds have become even more active in the rural areas, murdering Witted families in their sleep when they refuse to cooperate.  Moreover, the common folk are still lynching Witted suspects in the other Duchies.<br />Despite all these problems related to the Witted, Fitz and his friend still have to deal with Dutiful's formal betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania.  She is accompanied by her uncle, Peottre, as is the Outisland custom, and her father, Arkon Bloodblade, whose cronies have also come with the Narcheska. In their entourage is a serving woman, Henja, who is not what she appears to be. <br />Then there is the delegation of merchants from Bingtown, who want to ally with the Six Duchies against Chalced.  This is an interesting connection with The Liveship Traders series that may well figure prominantly in the last volume of the trilogy.<br />Just to make things more complicated, Fitz has quarreled with the Fool, and now the Fool only treats him as would Lord Golden.  One wonders whether they are both acting the Fool.<br />Recommended for Hobb fans and anyone who enjoys tales of adventure and intrigue in a fantasy setting.<br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B00003CXA2|5.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" is a movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. I remember seeing it when it first came out in the theaters and now I am glad to own it on the DVD. Tom Hanks (Oscar-winner) is Forrest Gump, a non-intelligent, but an innocent man, who was a runner, a college football player, a soldier in Vietnam, a ping pong player, and a shrimp boat captain. It was from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s and it is based on a novel. \\"Forrest Gump\\" is one of the best and most important movies of the 1990s.

This book offers many lessons to be learn about standing firm in your beliefs, the love of family and friends and the importance of equality. Scout's father, Atticus represents the father figure that every impressionable child needs - full of love for his children and worthy of their respect. The actions of many of the townspeople demonstrate how fickle people can be. The message will teach you to open your heart and mind to the world around you.
0385484518|5.0|A physically strong man who's morals, dreams, and aspirations are slowly decaying is reunited with his professor who is physically in decline.  This is the true story of Tuesdays with Morrie written by Mitch Albom.  This novel becomes one of the few pieces of literature that is somewhat life changing for every reader.  The novel forces the audience to reflect on daily life and the lessons are remarkable.<BR> The novel begins with the reunion of a fast paced sports writer, Mitch Albom, and his favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz.  The two promised to keep in touch but hadn't seen each other for about sixteen years.  When Mitch saw Morrie talking on a TV special about his disease, Mitch's intense guilt pulled him away from his life and back to his old friend.   They decided to meet every Tuesday just as they had when Mitch was in college.  Mitch began to fly down every Tuesday.  He kept Morrie company and at the same time Morrie passed his wisdom on.  Morrie was already incredibly wise and this was intensified by his change of viewpoint that came with being close to death.  They talked about the world, regrets, family, emotions, aging, money, love, culture, marriage, forgiveness and death.  As Morrie's health declined Mitch grew as a person. <BR> This novel might be the most life changing ever written.  Morrie's wisdom is beyond comprehension.  He knows so much about the world.  This novel reminds all readers the importance of living life to the fullest and not waiting until someone is sick to reunite with them.  Tuesdays with Morrie leaves the reader a better person.  The novel is one that I will read again just to be reminded of the life lessons it provides.  It is a book that I will never forget.

After being murdered she recaps all events leading up to her murder, and the ones there after. She watches as her family grieves and attempts to cope with their loss and the parent's unstable relationship. The style in which Alice Sebold, author of The Lovely Bones, portrays Susie's \\"looking out\\" for her family is magnificent.<BR>When Susie arrives in Heaven she is greeted with an array of things enjoyed in her past. Goal posts, old schools, \\"Seventeen\\", and whatever else her thoughts desire. There are of course other people, some of whom Susie befriends. Holly, a girl her age, becomes her best friend, and Franny her guide. Overall the picture perfect world that Sebold provides will astound you with its color.<BR> Through about 10 years of watching Susie sees her best friends, family, and boyfriend grow-up.

B000066AXC|3.0|A Beautiful Mind shares the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician whose private life was filled with fear and frustration due to mental illness.  I found the movie much better than the book.  However the book is more factual.  The movie tends to over-dramatize a life story that is already dramatic enough.
6305076995|4.0|I've read some mixed reviews of the DVD vs. the VHS. So I popped both in and sync'd them up. After flipping back and forth, there's no discernable difference between the two - in regards to both sound quality and picture quality - and certainly, the DVD is no worse than the VHS. Both were taken from film reels as the originals are probably long lost. Edge goes to the DVD since it offers track selection and the trailers (not that they're much of anything though), and chances are your DVD player is wired to your stereo system. <BR>This is a very young looking Yes filmed in their prime at London's Rainbow theatre in late 1972. Not many chances of seeing this classic concert. So until a way-back machine is invented, settle for the DVD.

DALLOWAY--I didn't despise them either. The patient reader will discover that it is more than the fictional Mrs. Dalloway that connects the book's three protagonists whose lives span three generations, but to say more about this would undermine one of the book's few surprises.<br />Cunningham's prose is flawless and narcotizing. Mercifully, he does not attempt to give us stream of consciousness writing. Observations and descriptions (even about things like flowers) are never decorative and gratuitous. Shifts in points of view are subtle, but always well signalled. The reader should never doubt that Cunningham is in control of his story. (If Cunningham is embodied in any one of his characters, I suspect it is the outward-oriented, ever-busy, and always in control Clarissa Vaughn.) What I find puzzling after finishing the book is how such a well-made book can be so emotionally unimpressive. Although the book culminates around a single dramatic event and the three separate strands of the narrative are drawn together, there doesn't seem to be much of a point. (The movie made from this novel seems to have stuggled with the same issue and responded by adding an improbable closing speech for an elderly Laura Brown.) Perhaps there is no point and Cunningham is making a coy play at being postmodern; or perhaps the point is that all of us--famous authors, disenchanted 50s housewives, or modern activist types--struggle with the same banal unraveling of the hours that make up our alotted time on earth. Karma is a big cosmic joke and our own pathetic lives are the punch line.<br />Amusing detail: Meryl Streep who plays Clarissa Vaughn in the movie is mentioned in passing in an early chapter of the novel.dern activist types--struggle with the same banal unraveling of the hours that make up our alotted time on earth.

B00006F83Y|5.0|The most incredible rock album since In Utero.  All the songs rock hard, and some even feel like classics.  Brilliant musicians here... go buy it, burn it whatever.  If you don't like this album, go buy a Limp Bisquick CD or whatever.
6305562474|4.0|Beautiful, elegant, seductive and entertaining film version of the translated, same titled play. Also adapted for the screen in a film called \\"Valmont\\" starring Colin Firth and Fairuza Balk, this film is extremely good. It's photography and direction is truly astonishing, as well as the classical music pieces. Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pheifer grace the movie with their excellent performances, as well as Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves in suprisingly one of their lesser known roles. A scrumptious film about the battle of the sexes.
B000002I2M|5.0|Just beats out MORRISON HOTEL and the first two. What amazing rocking blues. The dark is now a mist...but Jim's your guide, and he takes you right on down the highway or desert dunes of dying.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Many people say that hate this version of Stephen King's novel because there are elements that have been changed. It is a fact that the story has been changed somewhat, but the enjoyment that a person can get out of this film is an enormous amount. Jack Nicholson is pure genius as Jack Torrance and the rest of the cast and crew are also very good. The direction of Stanley Kubrick is the reason why this movie is so creepy, and the music<BR>score is also very eerie. No other movie has scared me this much. Not even 1973's &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; This is a must-see. Superb!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't know how so many people can put this film down. It is not &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. People time after time give new war films no credit because they are not as gritty as SPR. SPR was a new level of intensity in war films. It is however, unfair for people to expect every war film from now on to be as graphic. I can tell you now, no war film will ever be like SPR. It just won't happen. This film is good. It has elements of classic war films in it because it combines action/combat, and romance. I don't think it was meant to give all the historical details of the attack, like &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;. It was about how the attack changed the lives of a small group of people on a personal level. It is about the people, similer in theory to &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. This will someday be a true classic of the war film genre.
6302759110|4.0|Erotic rendition of the Bram Stoker horror tale. Not what I was expecting, but when I say this, I mean well. This version is well thought out, acting is pure and real, script is decent, costumes are beautiful, and direction is eerie. Probably one of the more creepy Dracula films, but not so scary that you can't breathe. It is the type of scary that includes realism and it comes in one package. This is one film that is loaded with characteristics from all types of genres.
B00000ILDF|5.0|When I first saw this movie, i hated it. I was a young boy and realised it didn't live up to my expectations. Until I realised why. All I wanted, as a \\"so-called alien fan\\", was another modified version of the two previous films. The first one, of course was really inventive, but all Cameron did for the second film was to multiply the exciting aspects of the first one : more guns, more aliens, plus a REALLY big one at the end to surprise us all ( as a 9 year-old i really enjoyed it) and more action. Its exactly like every sequel: MORE MORE MORE, but nothing new or nothing to say  ( Indiana Jones 2, Star Wars 2, The Mummy Returns, Back to the Future 2 and so on). And then came the third one. The one that most Alien fans hated. WHY? Because its not about aliens anymore. That's why. Because its not a modified version of the others. There are no guns, no big queen, no more cool marines to care about, no more spectacular action sequences, but only one quick and shy alien. At last, we see something new : A whole movie about Ripley. Her character is the center of the storyline. This movie isn't 'bout aliens, its all bout Ripley. Now we can see what was skipped at the end of the second film : her reaction after the 2 previous experiences, what is left of her life,and how she sees the future. It's more of a psychological drama than a simple action flick. And in the end, i must say that i first hated the conclusion. I didn't understood why. And it came to me that this is the only way it could end. Ripley's death. No one's waiting for her on earth and the ones she loved are all dead. There is nothing left for her. So she decide to die with the creature that ruined her life. They are somehow related and they die together ( with the queen i mean). I think its a really profound ending. But that's just an opinion.
6303921248|5.0|Beautifully photographed, well dramatized and perfect acting! This is obviously the best version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and I think others will also agree. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are excellent in their roles, and so are the other cast members too. Beautiful scenery and photography and a funny, witty, addictive script also create this masterful retelling of Jane Austen's romantic comedy.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie blew me away. I really enjoyed it and would recomend this all the way!<br />Note: This movie had a lot of twists and turns, and required you to do a little bit of thinking, so of course my dad came away with a feeling of confusion. This might be a movie you need to watch two times to get the true meaning of.<br />To start off, some of the futuristic ideas are just extrodinary, and seem very plausible. The futuristic cars (lexas) looked awsome, and like a design we could see in the near future, with the hydrogen fuel cell cars that is. Also, the way they had advertising.... it eaisly could be the wave of the future. And the way they have eye identification to personalize things... was another briliant idea. This movie could be stuided for all the futuristic content ALONE and be worth it.<br />Aside from this, it had a very good story. To sum it up, there is a person who works with the United States pre-crime department, and his job is to analyze data from 3 \\"precogs\\"(3 people who can forsee murders) and intercept the killer before they commit the crime. Later though, the precogs say that Tom Cruise is going to kill someone, so they are forced to arrest him, but he runs. This is when he learns that the precogs might have conflicting views, they might also view echo's(recurring visions), or they might have a minority report(a alternate ending to their vision, that is disregarded to ensure their system is 100% right). The whole story unfolds with twists and turns, characters seem to change right before your eyes. And it all leads up to the \\"murder scene\\", and then to the finaly story line, his farther is a murderer who \\"USES\\" the system to cover up his crimes.<br />The music is awsome, very well done.<BR>The music along with the action scenes reminds me, a great deal, of Star Wars II... without the lightsabers of course, hehe.<br />The visual effects are stunning and keep the feeling that you are truly IN a futuristic film.<br />Also please note: there is killing, shooting, and blood, along with other crime related actions, so caution to those with children.<br />~Hope this helps
B00004U2NX|5.0|Charming, scary, atmospheric remake of the 1923 Max Schereck silent Dracula film. Directed by Werner Herzog, this chilling film has been filmed twice - once in English, once in German. I have only seen the English version and currently own it. Klaus Kinski makes a terrific sympathetic but creepy count, and Isabelle Adjandi is magnificent and beautiful as Lucy. One of the best adaptations of Bram Stoker's classic gothic tale.
B000000W5P|5.0|This album is to the Wood era what Stick Fingers and Exile were to the Mick Taylor era.  Every song is a hit single and a regular staple on classic rock stations everywhere.
B00005JHCP|5.0|Masterpiece Theater does it again! This is the debut of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe. Ironically enough, quite a few of the cast members of this PBS miniseries have performed together, especially cast members from &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; This is a perfect film...no flaws at all. Comparable to the PBS miniseries,<BR>&quot;Moll Flanders.&quot;
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John is one of the true superstars in the world of music. He was popular when I was in high school and college in the 1970's and is still popular today. Few artists can claim a greatest hits CD collection that spans 33 years! Almost all of his greatest songs are on this 2 CD collection. Songs include &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot;, &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot; (with Kiki Dee), &quot;I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, and &quot;Circle of Life&quot;. The most obvious of the songs not included is &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;. His hits range from beautiful ballads to up-tempo songs. The CD collection also has a booklet with pictures and accounts of Sir Elton's music including pictures of the covers of his 41 albums. When it comes to wonderful music and good entertainment, no one can top Sir Elton John.
6305513406|5.0|As everyone knows this is the second pilot filmed in hopes of launching the Star Trek series and there are a number of differences between this particular show and the others that followed. Most notable immediately is the slightly varied opening and closing theme music; there is no voice-over narration by Shatner in the opening credits either. Other visible differences include the uniforms, the look of the recreation room and the conference room, the odd appearing intercom Kirk speaks into, Sulu is assigned to Life Sciences, the doctor is played by someone else, etc. It still is a very strong episode with a great story encapsulated in a taut script and cast well with the surprising guest stars Gary Lockwood (pre '2001: A Space Odyssey' fame) and Sally Kellerman (pre 'M.A.S.H.' fame) turning in excellent performances.<br />The Enterprise beams aboard a flight recorder from the missing and 200 year old ship U.S.S. Valiant, all that is left of the ship as near as can be determined. The tapes of the flight recorder reveal a very strange and disturbing story concerning the ship's encounter with an unusual force at the edge of the galaxy and also an obsessive interest in the subject of E.S.P. The tapes are too damaged to determine all the facts surrounding the log's narrative; Kirk decides to venture beyond the same demarcation line and that brings about devastating results for two crewmembers. Kirk is forced to take the dire matters into his hands and is left with only one diabolic but very necessary choice if he and the crew of the Enterprise, indeed the whole galaxy, are to survive.<br />After viewing the original pilot 'The Cage' it was described as \\"too cerebral\\" by the NBC studio heads that allowed the Trek creators to produce a second pilot. Though this show is also somewhat cerebral by nature, in 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' Kirk does get into a climactic fistfight, gets his shirt torn to expose his chest and proves himself a crack shot with a rifle. \\"ALLRIGHT!Now that's more like it! Give us more like this!\\" was the enthusiatic reaction of the studio heads to this second go-round (or least my exaggerated interpretation of their response). I don't want to downplay the serious undertones of the episode though; there is real tragedy here. The loss of Kirk's friend and ship's navigator Gary Mitchell and the medical department's newcomer Elizabeth Dehner is a devastating blow to the young captain. Lockwood's portrayal of Mitchell as a newly crowned deity like being is absolutely dead-on perfect. His taunting of Kirk is both creepy and agitating; when he speaks of his powers he sounds only egotistical and not enlightened. Kirk memorably summarizes his friend's quandary quite succinctly and eloquently in the exciting climax.<br />'The Corbomite Maneuver' is an equally good episode, creating some genuine suspense and a clever, fast thinking and nefarious looking alien in Balok. The ship he commands is also very intriguing; after it approaches the Enterprise it balloons to an incredible and intimidating size that the ship's sensors can't measure effectively. The creative staff had even better surprises waiting for the viewer at the end of the episode when Balok is finally unveiled.<br />During a star charting mission the Enterprise encounters a brilliantly colored cube rotating in space, impenetrable to the ship's sensors. At first it appears benign, completely harmless; later, when they try to move around it, it blocks their path and out of necessity they destroy the cube. Shortly afterwards an alien ship appears condemning the ship and it's crew to imminent destruction. With only a reprieve of ten minutes Kirk must either find a way to successfully negotiate their release or invent a clever means of escape.<br />The idea of the stray cube in space is a great concept, and would automatically cause the ship's scientists to assume an intelligent designer must be responsible for its being there. It recalls the Arthur C. Clarke short story 'The Sentinel' that gave rise to the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey', but in storytelling structure the episode resembles a quality more commonly found in the works of Ray Bradbury. This was the first appearance of DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy and his characteristic sense of humanity and his natural diligence to it comes into play right away. He defends the uptight and nervous navigator Lt. Bailey, marvelously characterized by Anthony Hall. Ted Cassidy provides the voice for Balok throughout much of the episode and it is most effective; he was also well cast as the android Ruk in the episode 'What Are Little Girls Made Of?' The final revelation in the show's finale is one of the most extraordinary in the entire ongoing Trek television series.<br />Some final notes: The juxtaposition of these two shows merits a brief discussion. This was the first episode filmed after the second successful pilot but the tenth show to televise in the series. It was said that the show was \\"too cerebral\\" so the character of Captain Kirk was 'dumbed down' a bit and shown to be a man of action in the second pilot. Suddenly in the next episode Kirk ignores any options to fight their enemy - and even chastises crewmembers that do! He wants to think his way out of this one. Naturally if he chooses to fight he stands little to no chance of winning, but the writers chose to place Kirk and his crew in this predicament so he would react this way. Apparently the studio heads were of little concern already. On the lighter side...early in the show Kirk casually strolls through the Enterprise corridors on his way to his quarters bare-chested and sweaty with his shirt hanging around his neck much like a preppie would carry his/her sweater. Is this really acceptable behavior from a superior officer?
B000001DU5|5.0|Tears for Fears has been one of my favorites since the 80s I was just a kid when they came out.  This cd has al their best hits including &quot;Everybody wants to rule the world&quot; &quot;Shout&quot; etc.<BR>2 incredibly good songs that not many non Tears for Fans knows about are &quot;Mad world&quot; and &quot;Pale Shelter&quot;, those songs are very powerfull to me, if the topic of women and how they are often controlled by their husband(read like slaves) and at the same time appreciate a beautifull ballad then the song &quot;Woman in change&quot; is for u, trust me its powerfull stuff!(I even understood the message when I was only 7 years old)<br />There are some songs that kind of goes in the one ear and out the others, but still its only one group called Tears for Fears, and there are many classic songs here regardless if they are from the 80s.  So al in al people who didnt grew up with these guys u must check them out dont limit yourself to only listening to new music.
B000068QY7|2.0|Faith I have plenty of when it comes to these guys, but for the sake of 2 or 3 songs and the odd verse or bridge from another few, this recording sounds like the inevitable demise of a once BRILLIANT pop band. The second track, especially following on the heels of the first (rather fantastic) track, is just plain awful- the opposite of ear candy. <br />I've been meaning to review this for a time, wanting also to give the album the benefit of the doubt. But after repeated listenings (thanks to my 4 yr old, who also listens intently to psychedelic era Beatles), I have to draw the inevitable conclusion: a virtual dud. Sorry or not, it must be said.<br />Save your bread for Coldplay; they may not have the same swagger as bros Gallagher but atleast they keep the writing and performance consistent. Heck, like earlier releases by Oasis, they have to work harder to get the public's attention. Oasis, meanwhile, are happy to slog off any old riff or lyric. Noel once remarked in an interview he thought all jazz was &quot;sh--te&quot;- well, Noel, take an honest listen to &quot;Force of Nature&quot;, self delusions aside. Even at their noisiest, melody was king in the early days of Oasis. Not enough of that musical device (namely melody) permeates this release.<BR>Having said all of the above, we still should be thankful for the &quot;glory&quot; days, appreciate them even more in light of this paltry offering.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD was so great!  I don't even know how to put in words how wonderful it truly is.  If anyone gets a chance to see Pink in concert, she is better then on the CD!  I saw her this past summer and it is what prompted me to get her album. She was Terrific!
B00006LSM3|4.0|Its too bad that George took so much time off from making music in the last years of his life.  This is such a good group of songs, and Jeff Lynn didn't do his usual over production ELO thing with this CD.<BR>Buy this CD, you'll enjoy it.  If you ever enjoyed George's music you won't be disappointed with this one.  This is better than his last 4 albums combined.
B000001FMC|5.0|A groundbreaking debut album. A must for cocktail parties, cool get-togethers, lounges, good club mixes(DJ's take note!!).  I only wish I could find the song \\"Wake Me When It's Over\\", not a hit in the US, but probably one of their COOLEST tunes.  I've only seen it listed on one import CD & don't think it is in print.  Can anyone help??
B00005JL78|1.0|I hate to go against the majority but the best two words to describe this movie are in my title. I'm just glad I saw my friend's DVD before I wasted any of my money on it. I think Spielburg should stay away from adult science-fiction. Everything looked like it was lifted from another science-fiction movie. I know that that is very common in sci-fi movies but when you mix unoriginal effects with a boring, confusing plot, and actors that probably shouldn't be there, it makes for one stinker of a movie. Sometimes there movies that you don't completely get on the first viewing but you want to watch it again to figure it out, this is not one of those movies. I just don't see why this movie was such a critical hit. I believe if it where done by anyone else but Spielburg and Cruse it would have been panned like it should have been.
B0000797IO|2.0|A bored married woman makes one enormous mistake and her entire life spirals out of control.  Each time she does something to cover up the affair, she creates a bigger and bigger mess.  Each time she tries to get out of the affair, it gets a little worse and a little harder to do.  The emotions run high, and the characters are ridiculously simple-minded.  Though the concept for this movie was good, it was quite unintelligent and weak.
B000001DV2|5.0|For what the band went through to make this album, it sounds fantastic.  I know, some of you think without Mutt and Steve, a Def Leppard album just isn't so.  Well, that's not the case here.  It still sounds like the classics that preceeded it.  End of story.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Self-titled? Awesome. Toxicity? Not as much. This? [See &quot;Self-titled&quot;]
B000009QO6|5.0|The sounds of Danzig on this one are something, and I have seen him do these ones live. There, wearing very little but a skull and horns and a pair of spats, these songs went straight to my libido! The first time I heard &quot;Mother&quot; was live, and I was visibly very aroused by the churning guitars and pulsing beat! Danzig is not quite as intense as other shows I've seen (Night Ranger, Sade), but what they lack in loudness and masculinity, they more than make up for in comedy. It is quite hard to watch Danzig and not to laugh very loudly at them, so I assume this is how they intend it, correct?
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton, author of such novels as Jurassic Park, has left his gigantic creatures in favor of a smaller size swarm.  Prey exhibits a deadly cat and mouse game with a twist unlike anything Crichton has written before.  No longer can the characters run away. They must stand up and face the evil, which consist of a swarm of tiny robots.<br /> Overall Prey is a good book that is worth reading.  The suspense equals or surpasses that  of Jurassic Park, however the plot did not stack up.  The beginning can be boring at times but it does get better as the novel progresses.  The biggest problem comes in the form of scientific information.  Not only can this confuse the reader with a lot of technical information, but it also does not mention certain weaknesses that the characters use later in the novel.  A certain element in the book explains it but it really does not get the job done (can't tell it because it would wreck the book :) ).<br />   Prey does have many solid points.  Once it gets going, it really hooks the reader.  The suspense in Prey feels different than in Crichton's other novels.  This book seems very realistic because the technology could really be in the near future.  Thinking of this could bring a shutter to the reader.  Could such a thing really happen? Yes.  Surviving the fight with this terrible swarm of nano-particles on the loose also proves to be an interesting ordeal.   No longer is anyone safe by hiding.  <br /> The twists in the plot really make the novel interesting. Most of the twists leave the reader thinking what can happen next; however, some seem corny. Things happen that seem to much like a cheap movie and make the end seem bizarre.  The book could have ended a lot better if it was not for a certain unnecessary scene.<br /> Prey really is a good book.  It has a few flaws, but most books do.  The pro's really outweigh the con's so this book is one to read. Prey should not be past up by fans of sci-fi or Crichton.
B00006CXXU|5.0|My fav. sogs off the CD are, Can't Hold Us Down, Walk Away, Fighter, Impossible, Beautiful, Make Over, Soar, Get Mine,Get Yours, Dirrty, The Voice Within. The CD really stands out and she does one hell of a job of telling people she don't care what they think of her. I can also relate to most of Christina's life and half of this CD helped me.
B00002MZ12|5.0|To experience Alanis fully and truly, one must hear or see her live.  Her voice envelopes the words and music she has written expressing the either rash, loving, tortured or self-undulgent feeling she had at the time.  Some may say that a career that has spanned as short as hers has, does not deserve an unplugged album.  She however, is one of the true artists of our time and does deserve one.  Why?  Because performing is where Alanis excels.  The power she posesses while belting out her jauggernaut singles and ballads is irreplaceable to anything you will hear in a long time.<BR>Not everything on this album is tried and tested, there are new songs on it, as well as amazing renditions of her 'classics'.  You Learn, Head over Feet, Princes Familiar, Ironic and You Oughta Know are sung in the tune of the originals but are changed.  Even with the changes, the angst comes through with an acoustic flair.  Incredible to say the least.  Joining You, That I Would Be Good, These are the Thoughts are new to her repitore and do not lack by any means.  These songs, from the second album, also have her ad lib trills and tune changes, making the songs a completely new experience.<BR>The new songs we are treated to are No Pressure Over Cappuccino, I was Hoping, and King of Pain.  King of Pain is a cover of the classic Sting song; and unlike so many people, her cover does justice to the piece.  Uninvited is a thought provoking piece from the City of Angels soundtrack.  One of Alanis self-proclaimed favourites to preform, listeners can tell why when they hear this last selection on the LP.  <BR>Experience Alanis Morissette at her best, experience her live-to-tape, in concert.   You will not be disappointed and will definetly not unplug your stereo while listening.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Loaded with authentic racing action, every camera angle, with only a few concessions to the mass market. Minimal plot - Mcqueen plays a race driver. McQueen was a race driver, he probably could have gone professional if he had devoted himself to it. He did some of the driving in this movie, 220 mph in the incredible Porsche 917.<br />If you want a storyline, you'll have to look somewhere else. But, if you want to be there, to feel, to live the 24 hours of Le Mans, circa 1970, this is your movie. <br />The best racing movie ever made.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I will make this quick and to the point.  This is they best movie I have ever seen.  The only bad part was that it had to end.
B00005AFLS|5.0|I am 35 years old now and this album is just as fresh as when I heard it back in 1982. This album is very underrated, it is one of those albums where you have to listen to all it. Every song is a classic. This is a masterpiece, I just wish I could of seen these guys live, it would of been a mindblower. The remastered CD is even better, I heard stuff that you could not hear off of the album. ELP rocks!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|The blues - jazz - all mixed together.  The best CD I have heard in a long time.  You know how you buy a CD and find there is only one song on it that really is any good?  EVERY song on this CD is incredible.  This CD will not disappoint you.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Though Audioslave's debut album has a handful of choice cuts, the over all quality of this record is average at best. There's not one challenging moment or shred of originality here. I don't believe the members of Audioslave truly believe in what they're doing and it shows. Tom Morello, one of my favorite guitarists of all time, sounds gimmicky throughout, not groundbreaking or awe inspiring like his RATM days. Cornell sounds good as usual, but even his solo album &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; has more heart that this.<br />On the brighter side of things, track #2, &quot;Show Me How To Live,&quot; is superb!
B00006YXEK|3.0|I read some very positive reviews of this disc and they had me expecting too much.  I would have bought it anyway, because I have all of George's music.  But I was thinking that the reviews had to be right.  To me, they weren't.  I would never try to disrespect George - I've been a fan since the beginning.  But I thought maybe as he fought his last battle, he had come up with the gem of his career and that's just not what I hear on this disc.  It sounds a little too even-handed, a little too syrup-covered.  I'll keep it and listen to it every now and then, hoping to be in that magical frame of mind where it will come into focus - but until then, I won't hold my breath.<br />Rest in peace, George.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam is still making relevant music, period. They're not the same band they used to be, that is obvious, but why would you want them to be? I've never understood the, what I call, &quot;AC/DC Need.&quot; The &quot;AC/DC Need&quot; is a music fans need for the bands they follow to stay the same. To stagnate and endlessly milk the niche they carved in the past. Pearl Jam is no AC/DC. They're ever evolving and challenging themselves to stay original. I commend them for their efforts, and their latest release, &quot;Riot Act,&quot; is one of their best albums to date.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I listen to music differently now than when I was a kid.  Back then, I needed to memorize and interpret lyrics.  I didn't need an LP to be consistently good, just a song or two.  But these days, I have a large collection and in it are many discs of music that I like front to back, the whole enchilada.  So I now listen to new music as a whole and see how I like the feel.  Homing onto what the lyrics say is less important.  If the music is real, has real emotion and real musicianship, the meaning of the songs will come with repeated listenings.  Not only that, but the way we perceive these things can morph over time, depending on what's going on in our lives.  So I guess this means is we own a certain part of our favorite music.  What does all this bull have to do with this disc?  I like it and I think I'll listen to it enough to get to know it well.  It's quirky and a little bizarre at times, but not enough to scare me away.  The musicianship and recording quality are excellent compared to most within this genre.  I don't think it's easy to record music that needs to be played back as loud as Steal This Album does.  But I think it has to be cranked in order to get the message.  I think I'm hungry for a slice of pizza...
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; could be called the greatest album of the 90's because of it's high influence to pop culture. The unmistakable riff from &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;In Bloom&quot;, and &quot;Lithium&quot; are what makes this album awesome.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I first saw \\"Amadeus\\" around 1984 when it was first released. Besides being a visual and musical masterpiece of film making, it kick-started my life-long love of and appreciation for classical music.<br />I won't repeat the story synopsis as it's already been thoroughly described both by Amazon.com's critical review and multiple customers here already. <br />I will say though that this edition, 'The Directors Cut', is a major improvement over the first DVD release. First, (and finally!!), the movie is now a single-side DVD...gone is the annoying 2 sided 'flipper' that the first release was. You can now watch \\"Amadeus\\" from start to finish without having to get up and turn it over. For my money, that's reason enough alone to own this new version.<br />Secondly, 'The Directors Cut' now adds about 20-30 minutes of previously deleted scenes, placed back into where they were originally intended. Personally I find some of the newer stuff enhances the story overall and fills in some details that were left vague in the original theatrical release.  I won't give away any details, but there is a new scene between Mozart's wife, Constanza, and Salieri, Mozart's chief musical rival (and secret arch-enemy) early in the movie that puts an whole new perspective of Salieri's twisted and battered psyche.<br />As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both exemplary. Included is a second disk with bonus material including interviews and making-of extras.<br />If you loved the original, you owe it to yourself to pick up this version. If you're new to classical music and Mozart, this is the best place to start.<br />lr** Jan  30,2003<BR> <BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0446677450|5.0|After reading the many reviews for this book, it FACINATES me to no end how any one can BASH the RDRP book series. I will admit they tend to be very repeative....but it has been said that repeative is the mother of skill...so that part did not bother me. <br />It seems to me that most negative reviewers focus too much in petty and irrelevant issues and lose sight of the simple ideas and philosphies RTK teaches. Somestimes all you need is one idea - as simple as is may seem - and that will make all the difference in achieving a seven figure net worth.<br />In the RDPD series, RTK provides the reader many ideas to run with - take your pick - ... it is up to the reader to TAKE ACTION .... or you can whine and cry like the many negative reviewers of this book ... for these people nothing will ever change - especially their net worth.<br />What did I get from these books? Here is one of many: The simple idea of acquiring multiple assets that will produce residual income - where it exceeds your annual income from your JOB. At that point, you have the FREEDOM to you can walk away from your JOB - if you choose. Don't take that lightly, for a lot of people it goes right over there heads and they do not take any action to move in this direction.<br />In my case, I had been acquiring real estate assets. I have acquired multiple income properties in the last 2 years - AFTER READING the RDPR series - and now have over a million dollar \\"net worth\\".  I largely credit these books for the simple ideas that got me going....Remember all the knowleage and ideas in the world mean NOTHING without taking ACTION.
B00003CY6M|5.0|You HAVE to be fan of John Cusack to appreciate this movie.  He gives yet another enjoyable performance being teamed up again with Jeremy Piven.  Their comedic timing and interaction are classic, and the best parts of this movie.  <br />If you did not enjoy movies like Gross Pointe Blank, Say Anything, or High Fidelity, you probably won't care much for this one.  But if you LOVE watching John Cusack at his best, here it is!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Only a scumbag would give this CD a poor revue! This is THE greatest album of music ever produced. I am deeply saddened that human filth are allowed access to the internet. I can only hope devine intervention will wisk away the sub-humans that have crawled from the steaming sewers of the world and flush them back down to where they belong. This album is a timeless work of art that will outlast anything being produced today. I only wish I could live long enough to say I told you so!
B000069HKH|3.0|I have a problem with this album.  In many ways in reflects a deeper problem I have had with Bruce Springsteen for a long time.  When Springsteens first album came out in the early seventies, I met Bruce for the first time in my best friends dorm room.  I enjoyed Bruce quite a bit as my friends and I drank our brew (we were big boys then.  At eighteen you could legally buy your own beer and go to bars.).  We talked about the lyrics and the music.  Bruce was in regular rotation on our turntables along with Humble Pie, the Stones, Allman Brothers Band, The Band and Robin Trowerjust to name a few.  We liked Bruce.  Seemed like a good guy.  But this next Dylan stuff was a bunch of bologna.  I mean he was goodbut he wasnt that good.  To try to make him more than he was left a bitter taste in my mouth.<br />As the years past, I was sure to get every new Springsteen record.  There was always good stuff on each record.  (O.K.  Ill just come out and say it.  Nebraska is a vastly overrated album that doesnt deserve any of the raptures heaped on it.  The fact that it was recorded on a cheap home tape recorder and then was released on vinyl pretty much as is at regular album prices insulted the buying public.  Maybe thats not what Springsteen intended; but I havent heard any apologies coming from his corner.)  As Springsteen went in hyper drive in the eighties, my problem with Springsteen came into focus.  The first part comes down to something like a B-B+ student being regarded as an A-A+ student.  When Springsteen came to town, you would think Jesus was coming back.  It always seemed overdone.  Now, you must understand, there is nothing wrong with being a B-B+ rock star.  Life wouldnt be the same and we would have been definitely poorer if Springsteen chucked it all back in New Jersey and became an English teacher.  Hes goodhes just not that good.  I say this as one who thought Tunnel Of Love was Springsteens best album.  I say this as someone who really liked Lucky Town and Human Touchtwo albums a lot of critics regard as throw-a-ways.<br />The second part is more troublesome.  There has always been something about Springsteen that has struck me as a little phony.  Sometimes I think its a cultural difference.  Here in the Midwest roaring down the streets in our cars isnt such a big deal.  Dying on the streets tonight is so low-rent.  And making love to our girlfriends on the sandy beach by the ocean isnt nearly so appealing as making it in her bedroomor our bedroom for that matter.  While each of these things do touch on common American experiences, Springsteen has a way of blowing them up to larger than life.  Thus while trying to reach the poetic, he winds up make statement that dont ring quite true.<br />It has nothing to do with the fact that Springsteen portrays himself as a blue-collar working stiff who in fact is a multimillionaire who once married and divorced a supermodel.  It has nothing to do with the fact that Springsteen owns homes in places the average Joe cant even get into.  It is the fact that Springsteen thinks he is saying something profoundand it isnt.<br />Which brings us to The Rising.  Its a good album.  Is it as good as everyone says it is?  Is it the best album released last year?  No.  The Rising has three excellent songs: Marys Place, Lonesome Day and Countin On A Miraclein that order.  Everything else is O.K to less than O.K.  Yeah.  I know what Springsteens saying.  I know what he is alluding to.  He just doesnt say it that well.  Better than you or me?  Probably.  But a lot of baseball players play baseball better than you and me.  That doesnt make them great ballplayers.<br />Springsteen just isnt as good as hes made out to be.  Neither is this album.  Its really a shame because I like the guy and I like this album.  There are a lot of rockers who make no pretense of being importantand one day it turns out they really were important.  Bruces tragedy is that he sets out to be important.  Indeed, he becomes important.  But in the larger scheme of things, hes just not that important.tense of being importantand one day it turns out they really were important.  Bruces tragedy is that he sets out to be important.  Indeed, he becomes important.  But in the larger scheme of things, hes just not that important.
B00004WG2X|5.0|This is still, by far, my favorite of the three main versions of P &amp; P available. I like the acting in this one, for the most part, much better. As said by another reviewer, Elizabeth Garvie makes the perfect Eliza Bennett. One thing about E. Garvie though, it was lamented in another review that she had not done much other acting. In fact I can name at least one other thing that I have seen her in: an episode of Fairy Tale Theater called &quot;The 12 Dancing Princesses&quot;, a series that played on PBS about 10 years ago. I don't know if it is still available, but worth checking out.  <BR>With regards to the other acting, I liked the portrayal of Mrs. Bennett much better, and also the portrayal of Mr. Collins. The one doesn't need to seem so disagreeable, and the other, not so slimy (comparing to A&amp;E version)
0525946284|5.0|i bought this book not really knowing what it was about, but once i started reading it i couldn't put it aside, I give it a 5 out of 5. i think anyone who loves a good book should definitly read this one, it was great. It's a great mixture of love, war and friendship.  Ken Follet is a very good writer and has great style.
B0000013G9|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing.  I am an avid music fan and<BR>this is without a doubt the most well-crafted CD I've ever heard.<BR>These girls are really talented and create music well together.<BR>Every song is absolutely delicious. Too bad there won't be anymore.
B00007H1Y2|2.0|As a lover of Cuban music I find this CD difficult to listen to.  Hawaiian slide guitars have no place in Latin or Cuban music and I fail to see why Cooder injects his own into an otherwise good CD.  These renditions would be far better without the annoying slide sounds.  The Buena Vista Social Club was a great CD marred only by the slide guitar.  I give Mr. Cooder a tremendous amount of credit for &quot;discovering&quot; the Buena Vista but please leave the slide guitar for other genres.
B000002Q88|5.0|I must admit that I'm a big admirer of this album.  In the Spirit of Things stands out as true masterpiece.  Although it doesn't have violin on it, the thick layered sound, excellent songwriting, and good production make it very listenable and fulfilling.  It's clear that the group put a lot of attention into this album.  Even the liner notes and photographs are intesting.  From the start of the album (the song Ghosts) you are transported far away, in this case to a Kansas ghost town.  The music is very visual on this album, and the lyrics are more personal than normal (more about relationships than fantasy stuff).  There are some songs that are in the pop format, but it would be terrible to label them as that.  They are actually very good songs and would have been made respectable hit songs if the record company had promoted them.  There are heavier songs on the album too, like One Big Sky, House on Fire, and The Preacher.<br />This album seems to stand on its own and is sort of at a crossroads.  I'd say that this is among the Top 5 Kansas albums.<br />By the way, this is also Steve Walsh's favorite Kansas album.
B00003CXDV|5.0|In December of 1999, director Dean Parisot unleashed what is arguably the funniest sci-fi/comedy film of all time, \\"Galaxy Quest\\", which focuses upon the dissatisfied lives of five actors who had starred in a long-cancelled sci-fi television series of the same name.  Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played ship's captain Commander Peter Quincey Taggart.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver, who is no stranger to sci-fi with her roles in the \\"Alien\\" films) played Lt. Madison.  Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, also known for his roles as Hans Gruber in the 1988 film \\"Die Hard\\" and Professor Snape in the two \\"Harry Potter\\" films) played Dr. Lazarus.  Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) played ship's engineer Tech Sgt. Chen and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) played ship's pilot Laredo.  Following the cancellation of the TV series, none of the actors had found descent acting jobs. Instead, they were relegated to appearing occasionally as their former \\"Galaxy Quest\\" characters at fan conventions and infrequent commercials.  Especially frustrated is Alexander Dane, a trained Shakespearean actor who cannot escape the stigma of having said those immortal words, \\"By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\\"<br />The film begins at a \\"Galaxy Quest\\" convention where the quintet is preparing to appear.  Unbeknownst to them, not all of the conventioneers dressed as aliens are pretending.  A group of uniformed \\"aliens\\" approach Jason (dressed as Commander Taggart) saying that they are in dire need of his assistance.  Jason quickly agrees and assumes that the group is planning to pay him to appear as Commander Taggart at a fan-function.  Following a night of drinking at his home, the \\"aliens\\" arrive in a limousine (per Jason's request) to escort him to their function.  The \\"aliens\\", calling themselves Thermians, are Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees) and Laliari (Missi Pyle).  While en route to their function, Teb recites the lengthy history of Thermia to Jason, but Jason (who has a hangover) falls asleep.  (Jason doesn't take the Thermians seriously; instead believing that they are simply \\"Galaxy Quest\\" fans.)  Jason awakens to what he believes is a very elaborate set mimicking the NSEA Protector from the \\"Galaxy Quest\\" show. Mathesar (who always refers to Jason as Commander Taggart) tells him that the Thermians want him to negotiate a peace treaty with General Sarris (Robin Sachs).  Instead, \\"Commander Taggart\\" orders the Thermians to fire upon Sarris' ship.  Assuming that he has completed his performance, Jason tells Mathesar that he is ready to return home.  Mathesar escorts him to an empty room and leaves.  Jason, not understanding what is happening, is suddenly enveloped within a strange substance and raised to the ship's exterior where he sees millions of stars in deep space.  He is suddenly shot from the ship, then finds himself standing next to his swimming pool at home.  Jason finally realizes that the Thermians are real extraterrestrials, and that they mistakenly regard the \\"Galaxy Quest\\" show (which they received in deep space) as being historical fact.<br />The other four \\"Galaxy Quest\\" actors are busy filming a commercial for the opening of an electronics store and are disgusted because Jason isn't there.  Jason arrives late and tells them about his experience with the Thermians, but they think he has lost his mind.  Jason tells them that the Thermians want him to return and that he wants them to come also.  They initially reject it, but change their minds when they mistakenly believe that it's a paying job.  Gwen, Alexander, Fred and Tommy are whisked away to the Thermian's NSEA Protector, along with another actor named Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), who had played a bit part on the original \\"Galaxy Quest\\" show.  With that, the most important role for each of the washed up \\"Galaxy Quest\\" actors begins!<br />Dean Parisot, along with writers David Howard and Robert Gordon, created a brilliant and engaging spoof of the show \\"Star Trek\\", its conventions and trekkies with \\"Galaxy Quest\\".  Tim Allen equated with William Shatner (Kirk), Alan Rickman with Leonard Nimoy (Spock), Sigourney Weaver with Nichelle Nichols (Uhura), Tony Shalhoub with James Doohan (Scotty) and Daryl Mitchell with George Takei (Sulu).  Other sci-fi comedy spoof that predate \\"Galaxy Quest\\" (such as \\"Ice Pirates\\", \\"Pluto Nash\\" and \\"Spaceballs\\") are no where near as good, engaging or funny.<br />All of the actors in \\"Galaxy Quest\\" performed their roles exceptionally well.  Two actor who played significant minor roles were Patrick Breen, who played the Thermian named Quelleck, and Jeremy Howard, who played the young and very helpful \\"Galaxy Quest\\" fan named Kyle.<br />I highly recommend purchasing \\"Galaxy Quest\\" on DVD, which has superior picture and sound quality, and includes several deleted scenes, trailers, biographies, the feature \\"On Location in Space\\" and production notes.  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is a film that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  Sit back and remember those immortal words, \\"Never give up! Never surrender!\\" as you are whisked away into the fantastic world of \\"Galaxy Quest\\"!
0783811950|5.0|This book is really amazing, because it does not teach, it does not impose any opinion but let everyone to find his own way, to find himself and to gain courage to follow his own ideas, to make mistakes and correct them, to fall down and again stand up, to understand and to forgive. Thank you, Mr. Coelho for giving me my Soul, my &quot;ego&quot;, my personality.
B00007H1Y2|1.0|I was thoroughly dissapointed with this CD. Lounge music of the worst kind. What a pity.
B00001U0E1|5.0|If I read one more negative line about this movie--especially as it relates to the writing or acting--I'm gonna lose it.  The writing is so clever, the acting so muted and beautiful (want proof?  Watch Tom Wilkinson become a theater groupie before your very eyes--PERFECT).  And ... criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the story. . .are you kidding me?  This movie is a treasure and we're deducting stars because tabacco wasn't planted in Virginia yet?  Get a life.  It is exactly what romantic comedy should be--romantic and charming.
B00004YTZE|5.0|The only studio album of Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers. The production is somewhat rough, but finally that also is a charm of this music. All songs are great. Especially I would like to mention Pirate Love\\", Can't Keep My Eyes On You\\", Chinese Rocks\\", It's Not Enough\\" and of course Born To Lose\\". Highly recommendable is also the corresponding live album Live At Max's Kansas City\\".
B00008977N|5.0|Secret World LIVE is by far one the best concert videos I have ever seen (and I have seen many.)  To finally have it on DVD makes me very happy.  The performance is incredible.  All Peter Gabriel fans should own this, and any casual listeners will become fans after seeing this video.  I don't know what kind of special features this DVD will have, but it really doesn't matter.  The concert itself is definitely worth the price of the DVD.  It is elaborately conceived and staged, from Peter singing \\"Come Talk To Me\\" from a phone box to packing the entire band in a suitcase during \\"Secret World\\" to the all out party that is \\"In Your Eyes\\".  Simply put, it is Awesome.  I have almost worn out my VHS copy and the CD of the show is my default CD.  I own so many CD's that it is hard to decide what I will want to listen to while I'm out of the house so \\"Secret World\\" always goes with me, and it never fails to work nicely.  I guess now I can go out and get a portable DVD player and keep the DVD with me, just in case.
1558908420|4.0|Sylvester Stallone has been known for making his ... old action films; Rambo, for the most part.  But in this exploration of dirty cops and the small-timer who can't get where he wants in life, Stallone plays a good, solid, dramatic role as Freddy Heflin, a small town New Jersey sheriff who looks across the river at the big apple, and what he wants most in life: to become NYPD. The big problem that arises is that in his small town, there are plenty of dirty New York cops who think they can slip by the slow sheriff, but Sylvester Stallone feels that something is happening from the start. This films shows Stallone's good acting skills.
B000002IOW|2.0|Mediocre at best, I liked &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; better than this CD.<BR>&quot;Show and Tell&quot; is boring and I really didnt care for this CD, nothing stuck out and grabbed me like there other CDs have..... There next effort &quot;Counterparts&quot; was much better. wouldnt recommend....
B00000JLWW|1.0|My apologies to Kundera, but this is, in a way, what he was talking.  'Titanic' is so light on substance and emotion that it is simply unbearable.  Until I saw Mel Gibson's 'The Patriot', this was the worst film I had ever seen.  The nauseating romance scenes, the blindingly cliche dialogue, the boring chase scenes, it's interminable length - these all add up to one of the worst movies of the century.  Like a few of the other reviewers, I, too, had to summon up great strength not to burst out laughing and cheering when Leo slipped into the dark Atlantic.  (I couldn't summon up enough and may have ruined it for a few people.)  I imagine people like the film's love story and drama, but you get more drama from a table and chairs.  'Titanic' would have been just a laughably bad movie, except for it's promotion and production.  Now it's just an unbearable waste of time.

B000002KAT|1.0|&quot;Astral weeks&quot; is a record that many praise and call a masterpiece. In my opinion it's just a boring experience from the beginning to the end. The songs are way to long and they seem to never end. I'm thinking about selling my copy.<br />If you're curious of Van Morrison, you should buy &quot;Moondance&quot; and &quot;Tupelo honey&quot; insread - two much better albums, all aspects included.
B00005JL78|5.0|Excellent work by everyone involved in this movie! Even though this movie may not be as groundbreaking as other Spielberg's flicks but is still a true marvel. The script/story of the movie is very innovative and intriguing, it will completely blow you away! Tom Cruise is amazing as usual. Thw whole concept of pre-cogs and crime prevention is mind boggling.<BR>However the movie gets a little bit melodramatic in the middle and drags on for a few minutes. Irrespective of the monor flaws, this is still one of the best movies of the year and a must have DVD.
B000002IJA|1.0|Let's get things straight. \\"Who made who\\" is a soundtrack album to the movie \\"Maximum overdrive\\" - it's not a regular studio album, nor a best of AC/DC. Stephen King is claimed to be a AC/DC fan and that might shed some light on this rather strange release. Maybe he wanted AC/DC to record something new to this movie - the song \\"Who made who\\" that in fact is a very good song. By this everyone could earn a few bucks more, and especially if there could be a whole album. But AC/DC didn't have any more new material so the band recorded two instrumental tunes (that we could do without), and filled the rest of the album with previous songs like \\"Hells bells\\" and \\"You shook me all night long\\".<br />If this were a regular studio album with \\"brand new\\" material it would be a very strong album (4 stars), but if we should look at this as a sort of best of AC/DC it won't do since the songs included ain't AC/DC's best material. If you're a AC/DC fan I guess you can buy this one just to get the title track, but if you're just looking for a  representative AC/DC record I'd go for \\"Highway to hell\\" or \\"Back in black\\" - AC/DC's two best albums.
0767805712|5.0|All those who think Star Wars is good science fiction, beware: Gattaca just might change your life. With nothing more than some gorgeously stark cinematography and direction; skillful, nuanced acting and a few well-chosen details, Gattaca sets the standard for serious sf films, telling a story that takes off from an interesting intellectual premise and ends up affecting the viewer on a richly emotional level. <br />Vincent, born without the aid of genetic engineering, hampered by his predispositions for violence and early heart failure, longs to make it out to space; when simple hard work and dedication fail to pay off, he turns to deception, purchasing the genetic legacy of genetically flawless but suicidal Jerome Morrow to get in the door at the Gattaca Corporation, his launching pad into space. Just as Vincent's goal comes into sight, someone bludgeons his mission director to death. The investigators who descend on the corporation soon discover a stray eyelash Vincent left behind, and name him as a suspect. Vincent, meanwhile, must continue his life as \\"Jerome\\" under the watchful gaze of the investigators while pursuing a romantic relationship with the nearly-flawless Irene. And the lead investigator is the last person Vincent wants to see.<br />Gattaca boasts some remarkable performances. Jude Law, playing Jerome, infuses all of his lines with anguished self-loathing, the anguish of one who never asked for the perfection--and its attendant expectations--that he was given, while Uma Thurman, as Irene, offers one of the subtlest performances of her career playing a woman whose perfection just isn't perfect enough for the world into which she was born. Loren Dean, as Vincent's younger, genetically improved brother Anton, also gives some affecting scenes. <br />A protagonist's role is usually the least demanding of a movie, as the need to be likeable and sympathetic tends to preclude much complication or darkness, but even in his limited role as Vincent, Ethan Hawkedoes remarkably well.<br />Gattaca is a movie well put-together from start to finish; every element of the film falls into place, and its cumulative effect is one that's hard to forget, even long after the credits roll. Highly recommended.
B000002ADT|5.0|Other than some Mozart recordings, I consider this *the* greatest recorded performance album of all time.  It took me a while to find what I was searching for, but when I found it it was like a revelation.  Almost like a religious experience - buy this disc.
B000003TAR|4.0|If Nevermind was Nirvana's Doolittle, then it's clearly evident that In Utero, the third Nirvana album, is Kurt's answer to Surfer Rosa (if those references didn't make sense to you, search for a band known as the Pixies). The two albums even share the same producer--Steve Albini, who is famous for his somewhat harsh production style, a result of relying on first and second takes with a minimum of overdubs. The glossy production of Nevermind has been stripped away from In Utero, leaving a much harsher and more personal Nirvana.<br /><br />The first two tracks of both Nevermind and In Utero are really telling as to the character of each album: Nevermind opens up with two poppy numbers--Smells Like Teen Spirit and In Bloom. In Utero on the other hand kicks off with two feedback-heavy angry punk songs--Serve The Servants and Scentless Apprentice. From the start Kurt announced that In Utero would not be nearly as commercial as Nevermind. And to me, that is a very, very good thing.<br />Heart Shaped Box and All Apologies were two radio hits from this album, but there's a surfeit of good material to be found here. The first two songs are fantastic, especially Scentless Apprentice with its pummeling riff and Kurt's howls, and it gets better from there. The angry Rape Me (with its inverted Smells Like Teen Spirit riff), the haunting Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle, the Beatles-esque Dumb, and the anti-abortion anthem Pennyroyal Tea are all in the top echelon of Nirvana's studio work. Kurt's voice sounds raw and vulnerable, and Grohl's drumming is fantastic.<br />If you haven't introduced yourself to Nirvana yet, start with this one, then buy Unplugged In NY. If you crave more, pick up the B-side album Insecticide. And yes, if you must, buy Nevermind too.<br />Note: Although I originally gave In Utero a rating of 5 stars, I now realize it is not quite \\"masterpiece\\" level. To achieve an absolute perfect score, I have to be able to play through the entire album and love every minute of it (and if there are flaws, they are inconsenquential to the point that I can overlook them). I usually skip over Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, and Tourette's is just pointless, so In Utero falls short of perfection, though only slightly. Read my rating as a high 4 (compared to Nevermind, which is an even 4). Hope that clears things up a little.lbum and love every minute of it (and if there are flaws, they are inconsenquential to the point that I can overlook them).

B00005U2JM|2.0|I just recieved the VHS Video version of this Concert of Marilyn Manson, and I must say I am very dissapointed. I don;t have a DVD player, so I needed to get the VHS version of this show, and none of the extras was in the video. The Death Parade Documentary was not included, no behind the scenes stuff, backstage footage, nothing! Just a concert. The concert was good though- typical Marilyn Manson show, so that was GOOD, but what happened to all the behind the scenes stuff? Why was not The Death Parade documentary not included on the VHS version?<br />Get \\"God is in the TV\\" or \\"Dead to The world\\" better.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|During a year i watch at least over 600 movies a year since it is part of my job. When i first rented Donnie Darko i wasn't sure what to expect. I loved it from beginning to end and went out to purchase the DVD the next day. Even though it was pricey at $.. when it was first released it was a good buy. The DVD is packed with bonus features such as a couple of commentaries, many deleted and extended scenes, trailer, still galleries, etc.<br />Where to begin on just how good this movie is? I'm not quite sure where to begin. The story itself is very original and enagaging. The cast is perfect and there is some marvelous acting throughout the picture. The visuals are simply marvelous, it is a treat for the eyes. The soundtrack is also quite excellent from 1980's pop tunes to droning ambience.<br />This is one movie in which you notice something different every time you watch. I've already watched it at least 10 times and that is incredibly rare for me to do that!

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a brilliant work of love, hate, companionship, and morals; which reaffirms Steinbeck's place in literary history.  The character Lennie holds a place in all our hearts as we traverse the odd little ranch-hand world of the early 1900s.  This story takes you back into the lives of two of the most intriguing characters readers will ever come across.  The plot twists and turns through interesting predicaments, one after another.  Only to arrive at its gripping, and depressing, yet cheering, but melancholy, and still joyous ending; all wrapped up with a sense of foreboding that makes you wish for a sequel...but want to let it be at the same time.  Everyone should read this book...it will open your eyes to reevaluate your future.
B00000J2PH|5.0|What can you say about Carole King other than she is an icon of the music industry, especially for the seventies era.  On this album she does it all, pop, rock and soul. I think Carole King's voice is clear and strong and full of emotion. My favorite is &quot;Way Over Yonder&quot; the depth of that song goes above and beyond a writers dream which is to touch someone out there, she certainly touched my life with her music.
B000002H2H|5.0|A decade before Metallica became TRL-friendly sellouts, Hetfield & Co. were putting out some of the most intense, badass, and technical political speed metal ever. This, along with Master Of Puppets, is a testament to Metallica at the height of their powers--when Metallica was still relevant, young, and aggressive and weren't about filling arenas.<br /><br />Released in 1984, Ride The Lightning was more refined and progressive than the band's raw and occasionally primitive debut Kill 'Em All. Every riff and solo on here is amazing, the energy is through the roof, and the song structures are drawn taut, with less of the thrash feel from Kill 'Em All. Hammett's playing was probably his fastest ever at this point. Listen to the furious opener Fight Fire With Fire--the sudden uptempo swing may knock first-time listeners out of their seats.<br /><br />I can't name a personal favorite track, because I'd end up mentioning the entire album. However, I will single out the powerful suicide lament Fade To Black as perhaps one of the 10 best Metallica songs ever. Even the \\"filler\\" track Escape and majestic instrumental Call Of Ktulu are strong efforts. Suffice to say, no sophomore slump here.<br /><br />I used to regard Ride The Lightning as my favorite Metallica release. However, I now realize that both ...And Justice For All and Master Of Puppets are equally great, just different. Ride The Lightning is the most uptempo and and least progressive of this trio. Master Of Puppets is more experimental in nature and dabbles with extended song lengths, and ..And Justice For All is is the most progressive and complex of the three. Different albums for different moods, and you can't go wrong with any of them.<br /><br />Most metal acts are lucky to release one five-star album in their careers. Metallica created three of them--this one, Master Of Puppets, and ..And Justice For All. Buy all of them. You can't call yourself a metalhead if you don't own these classic works. Once you've listened to Metallica's holy trinity, go back and buy their revolutionary debut Kill 'Em All, and maybe the controversial Black Album. Thank me later.trinity, go back and buy their revolutionary debut Kill 'Em All, and maybe the controversial Black Album. Thank me later.
B000002R4R|4.0|This is a good Soft Machine record. The most notable piece is Chloe and the Pirates. Really a triumph for 1973. Michael Ratledge's best piece ever. The album is a mixed bag really, with the last cuts being some of the best Softs and the earlier cuts being some of the most boring. Buy it for Chloe and the Pirates. You will not be disappointed! Decent spin!
B00006WKY9|5.0|The Scorpions really put it out with Taken By Force! A hard rocking album with some nice contrast songs mixed in as well.Many of todays bands come and go,but the Scoroions remain strong and tight. There music is as good live as it is in the studio. First things first! Taken By Force is an excellent sounding re-issue cd. The Bass parts and the low end play through extemely well without sacrificing any of the high end. Well recorded!! My favorites- Iv'e got to be free: Rebellious Rock at its best. Syncopated rythym guitar and hard driving bass /drums. The Riot Of Your Time: A touch of mystery on this one.Guitar work is outstanding! The acoustic guitar at the begining is flawless and there are some awesome drum fills to help close it out. Next up is Your Light: A nice mellow feel during the verses. Smooth guitar,tasteful vocals and solid laid back drum playing.\\"lots of percussion on the ending\\" Very cool! Born To Touch Your Feelings: A slow ballad that features beautiful vocals and acoustic guitar.The band really shows us how well they can play loud and soft.\\"nice dynamics\\" The ending offers some strange yet creative female vocal ad libs. He's A Woman-She's A Man: Is a rock n roll boogie thats guaranteed to get you jumpin!!\\"i love the accented chorus line\\" The last song features a live version of Polar Nights: Live jamming in the raw! Energizer bunny watch out. These guys are blowin the roof off!! Whip it out guitar playing and more!! Final thoughts: Taken By Force has a little bit of everthing for scorpion fans. Solid and Tasteful!! Enjoy!
6302814359|2.0|Not so much a sequel as a &quot;re-imagining&quot; (think Tim Burton's &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.) It pretty much gives up on the horror aspect of the original ROTLD and focuses on comedy, sometimes it suceeds in getting a laugh (James Karen's performance is great) but it fails often (the &quot;Thriller&quot; zombie near the end for example.)<br />However I'd still like to own this on DVD but sadly Warner Brothers hasn't seen fit to release it yet. If you want it on DVD I strongly suggest you write them a letter and ask for one!<br />Here's their address;<BR>Warner Home Video<BR>4000 Warner Blvd<BR>Burbank, CA 91522
B00006LSM3|5.0|he did it again... george created an unbelievably beautiful body of work that rivals the best work of his career.. and that's pretty unbelievable. he produced these tunes while in his mid to late 50's, yet the tunes are vibrant, relevant and totally cool; his voice - dispite his struggle with (lung) cancer at the time  - is sweet, beautiful and penetrates the soul; and, oh, his guitar work -- simply perfect. i think he goes down as one of the all time great slide guitarists.<BR>  george's reputation was forever cast by the mid '60s. he continued to grow as a human being and artist over the years dispite the fact that he generally kept a low profile. then, as he knows his time on this planet is drawing to a close, he decided to produce some of the best music of his career.. listen to &quot;any road&quot; for the wisdom in the lyrics. &quot;pisces fish&quot; for a classic harrison anthem. &quot;rising sun&quot; sounds like a late era beatles tune to me..  i can keep going on and on, but i won't.. <br />just buy the record. this guy changed my life 35 years ago, and continues to add so much even today. thank you george for being the man you were and for giving us one last treat. you're sorely missed...
B00006CXXU|5.0|There is not one thing I can say about this CD that is bad.  Christina's voice is just amazing and even if you may not like her look or her lyrics, you have to admit her voice is strong, powerful and engaging.  Every song on this album will have you listening, again and again<br />My review of the tracks:<br />1. Interlude<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down--Very powerful and true!!  The rapping by Lil Kim makes the song even better  (5/5)<BR>3. Walk Away--shows Christina's strengh, a little to drawn out but still good! (4/5)<BR>4. Fighter--The beat is differant and that what makes the song awesome (4/5)<BR>5. Interlude<BR>6. Infatuation--The spanish theme got me hooked on this song, it is sexy and fun (5/5)<BR>7. Interlude<BR>8. Loving Me For Me--Again this song shows her strong and engaging voice (4/5)<BR>9. Impossible--A little to jazzed up for me! (2/5)<BR>10.Underapprecated
B00007ELEL|5.0|If you like quirky humor, this movie is for you.  I'm surprised that this flick hadn't produced a larger cult following because it's one of those movies where with each viewing, it just gets funnier and funnier.  Highly underrated.  Ofcourse it helps if you're a pothead.<br />Notice the Dude's mood immediately after that doctor's visit.  F'n classic.
079073639X|5.0|book was better but the movie was alot better than the &quot;Abyss&quot;
0151008116|2.0|I loved the conceit of the plot: boy and tiger in life boat.  As a well-illustrated childrens' book---perhaps with pop-up pages---it would have worked.  But by page 200, the Life of Pi sinks, along with the reader's expectation of epiphany, of hoping to discover one lasting moment or lesson. <br />Mark this: those who tout this book as a paean to spiritual awakening and endurance are wrong.  What happens here is the boy survives.  It happens to people and is often heoric.  That Pi has has to surive under such contrived circumstances is survival caricature.  It is embarrassing and suggests an artist inability to write about the tough and magnificant human spirit.  We learn nothing from this book, carry away no experience, look for and find no parable in the story that illuminates.  <br />The book jacket suggests that the Life of Pi may &quot;make you believe in God.&quot;  Perhaps good writing can do just that, for a minute or forever.  Certainly, there is no glimpse of the divine in the Life of Pi.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Everyone assumes that Britney's music is really bad just going by the singles- this isn't true! Ok, she isn't as strong as Christina with the vocals, but her songs are catchy and fun which is what they were made to be!<br />OOPS I DID IT AGAIN-7/10: Sounds very like \\"BOMT\\" and was overplayed but I don't mind listening to it now.<br />STRONGER-2/10: Don't like this at all because it sounds so boring and typical pop style (it's just too plain!)<br />DON'T GO KNOCKIN' ON MY DOOR-7/10: A very catchy and well constructed pop piece.<br />SATISFACTION- 10/10: Rolling Stones fans will hate it but r and b lovers will be pleasantly suprised at how good Brit managed to cover this!<br />DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW- 8/10: A ballad written by Shania Twain's husband, which is very good. Sounds very different to everything else on the album.<br />WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U GET- 9/10: Again sounds a bit like \\"BOMT\\" but this time it's better! Has a dancy beat and sing a long chorus.<br />LUCKY- 10/10: The best Britney song ever released! Has such a beautiful melody and heartfelt lyrics.<br />ONE KISS FROM YOU- 10/10: Another favourite of mine, although to the average listener it sounds quite average. I can't explain it, I just love it!<br />WHERE ARE YOU NOW- 9/10: You can almost see Britney standing on a stage in a state like Mariah Carey in the 'Hero' vid! The song is excellent but the lyrics are very simple.<br />CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME- 7/10: Nothing special, another standard pop song.<br />WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT- 10/10: A Dianne Warren ballad without the big strings and OTT harmonies! Britney's delicate voice works very well with this slow track.<br />GIRL IN THE MIRROR- 9/10: Stunning melody but again the lyrics are pretty dumb!<br />DEAR DIARY- 1/10: Ignore this song completly, it's embarassing to listen to (the lyrics and the tune are rubbish!)
1576751988|5.0|This book was wonderful. I read it in a couple of hours and began to implement what I had learned into my routine immediately. This book is a short, no-nonsense guide to getting your life together - whether in buiseness or your personal life.<BR>    I also found that this book can be easily applied to almost any business whether it's in marketing, teaching, direct selling, etc. you can focus on the book as if Tracy were writing specifically to what you do. He is good on focusing on steps to get you where you need to be rather than mentioning the steps and going into great detail and analysis about it. And I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to either get a jump start or wanting to move up. Work with what he gives you and you will get there quickly.
0671027387|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, knowing full well that it was a thriller without pretensions at being great literature.  Sadly, the book was so poorly written that what should have been fun was overshadowed by silly characters, and plot points that were horribly contrived.  The supposedly &quot;brilliant&quot; characters were repeatedly flummoxed by the simplest deductions, and saved by the most outrageous luck.  Stick with Katherine Neville, or even the Garforths for more intelligent escapist entertainment.
0783235968|5.0|I love baseball.  Not only in its purest form is it the greatest game ever invented, it is also the only game that completely and thoroughly transcends and binds our country to past, present, and future--generation to generation.<br />Director Phil Alden Robinson's FIELD OF DREAMS pays homage to baseball's majestic, magical link to nostalgia.  When a struggling Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) begins &quot;hearing voices&quot; and subsequently plows under his cornfield and builds a baseball diamond, he becomes a pariah to his community--to his family.  But Ray knows he's tapped into a special level of consiousness:  a beautiful, soothing karma that slowly but wonderfully manifests itself throughout this incredible film.  The baseball field itself becomes a portal to another world, enabling players from baseball's Golden Age to return.  To play baseball.  As the film draws to its dramatic, moving ending, Ray surveys his field of dreams and remarks, &quot;This is perfect.&quot;<br />And it is.<br />Kevin Costner turns in his finest performance.  Ray Liotta, Amy Madigan, Timothy Busfield, and the great Burt Lancaster are exceptional.  But it is James Earl Jones, who plays disgruntled author Terrence Mann and eventual soul mate to Kinsella, who is the catalyst that takes this film to a higher level.  And FIELD OF DREAMS goes to that level, and beyond, like a homerun leaving the upper deck.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000001TVD|4.0|Out of the post-Hendrix age of rave and distortion comes...FUNKADELIC!<br />&quot;Maggot Brain's&quot; studio effects sound a little dated at times, but that's a very small complaint after being treated to Eddie Hazel's axe work. (why his solo album, &quot;Games, Dames &amp; Guitar Thangs&quot; didn't sound like this, I'll never know!)<br />According to an article I read on the Web, Jimi actually met Eddie and complimented him on his playing.  What an explosion that would've been had the two recorded!

0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is as beautiful as any work of art can hope to be.<BR>It is in the latter parts of the book, where Mersault's words have a lyrical power not seen previous, that the English translation achieves the haunting effect that must be even more prevalent in the French. The first thing readily obvious is that the character has no emotional connection to what he experiences; he simply experiences. Thus, Camus utilizes an American style, terse and detached. Some reviewers were off put by this. \\"How could he not care that his mother died?  \\" Attaching immorality to Mersault merely shows a total misunderstanding of the book. <BR> Camus believed in \\"absurd freedom,\\" life has no inner value and is futilely cut short, but it is up to us to determine our life in such uncertainty. If one doesn't interpret life, emotion doesn't exist. But the values that society has incriminate you if you don't conform. They make you strange. They take no account of individuality.<BR> That is the peril of the main character after a bizarre series of events on a sun drenched beach.<BR> The power of Camus is that even though he creates such a bleak, hopeless human situation the characters still go on as best they can, perhaps even attaining happiness. \\"One must imagine Sisyphus happy,\\" to quote The Myth of Sisyphus.<BR> That is also the power and beauty of mankind.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|One of the bigger disappointments of the summer blockbusters. The movie was not as clever as the first one and the plot was weak. It relied too heavily on CGI as if that would replace the obvious lack of a solid plot. The ending was trite and quite a let down.

0385495323|5.0|The book was superb. I have never had any Popular Science book hold my attention in this way since reading George Gamow's One Two Three...Infinity.<BR>The author shows excellent knowledge about the subject matter, explains complicated mathematics and technology with patience and also with success, and combines the Scientific details with excellent story telling.<BR>The history of cryptography and cryptanalysis is fascinating and the author captures all the details with excellence. <BR>From the engineering intricacies of Enigma to the amazing story of the Navajo Cryptographers; from the complex mathematics of RSA to the details of the PGP; from the cypher of  Mary Queen of Scots and the naive encryption of Julius Caeser to the futuristic description of the Quantum Computer; from the life of the multitalented minds like Charles Babbage and Wilfred Diffie to the  stories of the unsolved cowboy ciphers promising unlimited riches....the book is a treat and a wealth of information. Compared to the drab, dry and utterly journalistic approach of the modern writers on popular science, this is a gem of its genre.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is my all time FAVORITE album by the great Red Hot Chili Peppers. In fact, this album should have won Album of the Year. But it was probadly too explicit for the Grammy voters during those times. If it wasn't for these guys and this album, half of the bands you hear today wouldn't exist. Think Fred Durst and his band. Chris Rock was RIGHT!! This band is funky and BAD. So what if they are white? They were the best. And this album still gives me goose bumps and makes me ROCK!! Anybody with a slight taste in good music will like this album. Get it!!
1590710037|5.0|I was blown away.  I was awed.  I was inspired.  It's poetry, and if you're an artist, this book could speak to you like no other book you've ever read.  I'm not a culty, joiner type person.  I don't jump on a bandwagon easily.  But I am now a huge fan of Steven Pressfield's book.  As a writer who went through EVERYTHING Pressfield describes in this manual for self-defence against self-destruction, I can't recommend it more highly to anyone who wants to &quot;be all that they can be.&quot;
0784011796|3.0|Pi was, is, and always will be, a movie not meant for the masses. The plot is hardly one that most can sympathize with. A disturbed, neurotic mathematician with schizophrenic tendancies spends his life trying to find a fantastic number that is not only the name of God, but is also the key to unlock important patterns in life. <BR>  Visually, the movie is difficult to follow. The grainy black and white print is difficult to interpret for one who is used to crisp digitally edited prints. The movie looks like something that would be screened on a wall in an art museum. <BR>  The soundtrack is wonderful, and creates a sense of eerie unreality. The techno may annoy some, but creates the proper mood of loneliness. <br />  All in all, a well made movie with a plot that's hard to relate to, and pictures that are occasionally difficult to understand. But doesn't it have a killer ending? :)
0066214122|3.0|I like some of Michael Crichton's works. In fact, Disclosure was a great read, Congo very interesting with the adventure and the lovable Amy. However, I somehow feel that though he is a pretty good writer with a gift for cutting edge technology, somehow, he doesn't have the same grip for defining characters or describing action sequences.<BR>While the concepts of nanotechnology and artificial life were interesting enough to provoke me into reading up some in depth material on Genetic Algorithm and AI, the repeated action sequences with the swarm keeping on attacking the characters got more than a little boring.<BR>While I was pleasantly surprised with Crichton's promising depiction of Forman's family and inter personal relationships in the first one third of the book, it soon went haywire and the plot shifted totally to the long drawn out chases by the swarm then onwards.<BR>The only reason I did not give the book two stars was is the fact that the concepts of Genetic Algorithm and Distributed Computing are wonderfully explained and really whets the readers appetite into reading more into it.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam is probably the most controversial \\"rock-alternative\\" band out there today, fortunately still out there today.  Riot Act is a totally original album; it is easy to see how the band has evolved in the past ten years, grown artistically and passionately. The people who say that the \\"new\\" Pearl Jam [is bad] are used to three minute long tracks with a couple choruses, a bridge, and a blinding fast guitar solo; anything else outside the comfort zone [is bad]. Go home and suck your thumb if you want immediate satisfaction.  Watch MTV and eat fast food. As for me, I need something more than the mindless, repetitive garbage of modern pop. Riot Act, like Binaural blows that concept away. This music has layers, it has drive, and most of all it has pure love. Pearl Jam is not from a factory assembly line robotic cookie-cutter. Pearl Jam is from somewhere else, a place rediscovered every time a chord is struck.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I can't say much about this album and the experience speaks for itself.  All I can say is it takes you someplace else, someplace out of doors that's very quiet and cold and of great beauty.  The first part is simply surreal.  It transports and relaxes. Part two starts the same till the end of the last two songs... Heavy, loud powerful only words to describe it.  Before those parts I thought the drummer was just ok... they boy can pound the heck out of a set let me tell you...  This band is impressive no doubt, emotional and progressive, some people might not label this as \\"progressive rock\\" but sorry but that's what it is, just listen to track 8 and you'll know what I'm taking about.  By this album it's Iceland's best export.
6302642175|1.0|End of line(the movie's tag line) is an appropriate phrase. End of thought would have been more appropriate for the writers of this story and script. Tron was visually stunning - at first. Eventually, you realize that there is no real photography except for the faces of the \\"programs.\\" This is done in black and white. The rest of the figures and props are in color, but most of the background is simply black. The box's summary of the movie is misleading. Tron himself is bland and not especially heroic, the villian (the master control program!)is disappointing visually, especially when compared to it's completely evil voice. The scene progression is jerky, with characters added and removed with no reasons given. The end is completely confusing. It really looks like it was simply pasted on when the rest of the movie was done. It makes very little sense. Nothing was explained. <br />The movie might have been easier to follow if there had been an extra hour or so of explanatory scenes, but that would make it even more boring. <br />As a final note, Tron should be watched, but only as a comparison to other excellent efforts by Disney such as \\"Toy Story\\" and others.

0066214122|2.0|Face it.  We don't read Crichton's novels for the characterizations.  We read them to hear the professor lecture about something interesting from the vantage point of some God-awful situation caused by whatever it is the lecture is about. <br />And it's good schtick--usually. This time out, however, the professor has pretty much retreaded Andromeda Strain, but without the attention to detail.  The Concepts here are autonomous behavior that emerges from certain types of computer programs and nanotechnology running amok under the influence of said programs.  The problem with the book is that the Professor only knows that this combination is Something Bad.  He really doesn't know how to describe the workings of either one in any way that is dramatic or even novel.  The end result is a mind numbing repetition of the basic concept propped up by an endless succession of obvious small cliffhangers in each chapter.  Worse, well before the end of the book you realize that Chrichton has done this all before (see the microbes of Andromeda Strain) with much better attention to the small details that have led us in the past to invest our time and money.<br />Bottom line:  Let this one go.  It's too derivative in its story and too uninventive in its conceptualization to be worth the investment.
B00008DDRX|5.0|If you are looking for a racing movie with a lot of plot, drama, heavy dialogues, etc., then this isn't it.  However, if you want a pure \\"racing\\" movie that really captures the excitement, aroma & environment of a major international motor race, then look no further.<br />McQueen's movie is actually from the 1970 24 Heures de Le Mans event, and it features some of the best prototype sports car the sport has ever seen -> Porsche 917 & Ferrari 512, to name a few.  <br />Le Mans takes us back to an era when the circuit at La Sarthe was exceptionally fast and dangerous.  If you feel like going to the races, but don't want to leave your house, then I highly recommend this movie.
0676973779|4.0|This is an excellent story. I really enjoyed his spirituality in the first sections of the book- his referral to how Ghandi believed that all religions were true etc. and his dissillusionment after his meeting in the park with his three religious leaders and their prejudices. For me, the second part (in the boat)was intriguing. You want to believe the events as he is narrating them, but it seems too fantastic. The final chapter, where the true story is told is what makes it the award winner for me. I love when I have to mentally go back through a book and put it all together with an entirely new perspective.

B00005JLSC|5.0|With the success of \\"Moulin Rouge\\", and now \\"Chicago\\", the public seems to be hungry for a genre in Hollywood that has been absent for far too long----the movie musical.  In recent years, it seems only animated films with musical numbers such as those from Disney, for example, succeeded.  Now \\"Chicago\\", following in the foot steps of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is eager to buck the trend.  Stylish, well acted and well sung, this movie succeeds in all areas.  The choices of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly could not have been better.  The Golden Globes awarded Zellweger and Gere, the actress and actor trophies in comedy/musical and gave the film the nod for best comedy/musical.  It is well deserved.  The story moves along smoothy and the musical numbers melt into the plot perfectly. The choreography is flawless and the actors can actually belt out a tune!!  Hopefully, Hollywood and the public will take notice and make this movie the blockbuster it deserves to be.  This will definitely be a dvd I will add to my collection.  Check it out!!!!! You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict.  Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune.  As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend.  Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.  <BR>The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character.  Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions.  Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws.  Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions.  Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to.
B00004WG2F|1.0|It's a commercial for Brad Pitt on the horse, which is unnecessarily and annoyingly long. That's it, nothing more. Besides, it doesn't work. Brad Pitt looks stupid in this movie, thouth I admit he is still hansome. Nearly all of the characters are annoyingly irreasonable and irresponsible. Female characters look especially stupid. Also, I am really sick of seeing white people mystify the native Americans, pretending to forget the fact it's the White who destroyed them almost entirely.<br />It's not a good movie, though its background is beautiful and some hansome and pretty people are in it.

How terrific that Dr. Cordain has shown that the proteins I love can be combined with non-starchy fruits and vegetables -- while I'm still losing weight.

B00005NTNU|5.0|This collection is too godlike.<br />\\"Dirty Harry\\" - Clint Eastwood plays Inspector Harry Callahan who has just been brought in to find a maniacal psycho who is playing as a sniper in San Francisco. Dirty Harry gets all of the dirty jobs and demolishes everything. He even took care of a group of bank robbers while eating a hot dog... He punched out a suicidal man ready to jump off of a building... He then took care of the psycho. \\"I have the right... to a lawyer!\\" the weird man screamed. The most powerful handgun in the world, yes. That psycho deserved what was coming to him after taking a school bus hostage... Harry must've made that guy fly ten feet in the air off of that little pier...<br />\\"Magnum Force\\" - A group of vigilantes are cleaning up the streets the old fashioned way, above the law. Well, nobody is above the law except for Dirty Harry. Silly partners always get it. Those rookie cops sure can shoot. \\"Harry, you shot a good guy... An ok sequel with Clint Eastwood taking care of business once again.<br />\\"The Enforcer\\" - Harry is assigned with his first woman partner. This time a group of protesters who do dastly deeds are threatening the mayor and only he, the Messiah, Dirty Harry can take care of them... The movie is slow and it builds up to a huge climax on Alcatraz Island. A rocket launcher was the perfect choice to take out the main rebel, but poor partner got it once again. Will they ever learn that Lordage doesn't need any partners?<br />\\"Sudden Impact\\" - Grisly murders are taking place all done by the same killer. A woman who is looking for justice takes the law into her own hands. \\"Go ahead and make my day.\\" Dirty Harry takes care of plenty of garbage in this movie. Watch the end where he comes back to the ferris wheel and then the guy falls onto a unicorn... Ok, but why did Harry let the woman go? Bad Harry.<br />\\"The Dead Pool\\" - Probably the funniest and best movie since the first. Harry investigates murders that are happening on a movie set.A little remote controlled car chases Harry down the streets of San Francisco and Harry spears the bad guy at the end, literally. \\"Welcome to the jungle!\\"... If you don't buy this, then you are pure mortal.

I watched the first movie and that one had more facts and more of the story in it. But this one is more action, and makes the first one seem babyish to me. But I still think this was a little too gory, but amazing, sort of scary movie. What I liked about it the most is they didn't overdo anything: the scariness, the humor, or the goriness of it all. And the actors really took on there parts and they became the people. (or in some cases: hobbits, dwarves, orcs, or elves)
B00000IQC8|5.0|One of the most talked about debuts that is loved by both critics and the public, 'Clerks' is Kevin Smith's masterpiece that was made on such a low budget.  The budget might've been low, but the quality turned out to be very high.  If you haven't seen this film yet, then you are missing out big time.  This is the one that started it all, and gave us the impression of a new and talented filmmaker.<br />Most of the film takes place at a convenient store.  Dante isn't supposed to be working, but he is.  What was supposed to be his day off turns into a day filled with chaos, disaster, and outrageous conflicts, (and all because he decided to come to work).  Randall, who works at the video store, spends most of the time at the convenient store.  He's as rude as they come and isn't afraid to get in a customer's face if he feels the need to do so.  You add all this up along with the crazy shoppers who do nothing but drive the two nuts and you get a film filled with unpredictable twists and hilarity.<br />Smith's real talent is in his writing.  He is a great director, but he is an even better writer.  The dialogue that you hear from the movie is very realistic. The characters aren't talking for the only purpose of moving the movie along.  They actually talk like you and me talk.  (Well, maybe some of us don't curse as much, but you know what I mean.)  And as outrageous or unbelievable the movie becomes, it is all constructed in a manner in which we could actually see this going on in real life. The writing is effective, the acting is top-notch, and the directing is very well-executed.<br />The DVD has some cool extra features that are bound to make you happy.  It's not a 'fully-loaded' special edition, but it's a lot better than most of the DVDs that are out right now.  The picture and sound quality is really good, considering how low budget the film was.  Being shot in black and white adds a raw and realistic feel to it that wouldn't had been as affective if it were done in color.  (Yes, it is black and white.  It is black and white because that was how it was shot.  I've read a few reviews saying that they're waiting for a colored version to come out.  No such thing exists.)  The special features are deleted scenes, an alternate ending, audio commentary done by the cast and crew, the theatrical trailer, and a Soul Asylum music video.<br />'Clerks' is a hilarious film that will surprise you every time.  Be warned, there is a lot of offensive and rude language in it, so if you don't like films with a lot of that then you better skip it.  This is a film that continues to be a favorite of mine and is one I have yet to become sick of.  This is a movie that shows you that while 'serving' you is required in the job, 'liking' you is not.  Get in and get out as quickly as possible, or feel the wrath of Dante and Randall. (Especially Randall.)color.  (Yes, it is black and white.  It is black and white because that was how it was shot.

006092988X|5.0|This book I read as a child as well as seeing the movie.  For anyone who loved Anne of Green Gables, this book is as beautiful in a different way.  It teaches morals, values, and the practical versus the emotional (and how each has its own value.)  If you are searching for the perfect book for a daughter, grandaughter, or niece--10 and up, you just can't go wrong.  It also provides a glimpse backward into America's history, when things were harder to come by and appreciated more.
0316666343|2.0|I found this book disappointing.  There was so much hype and it fell short of my expectations.  The dialogue was not believable, and there was no closure at the end.  It seemed to ramble on forever without the good ending I had expected.

B00005QG9J|5.0|If you haven't heard the new Incubus cd (Morning View), then you are just not cool.  It is one of the greatest albums of the year and deserves recognition as so.  I bought the cd for the songs &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot;, but I now know that it is much more than that.  It has the hard rock songs that brought us to the band in the first place, but delivers a punch with the soft songs of &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot; Aqueous Transmission&quot; that bring us even more to being a Incubus fanatic.  Then they really give you cold shivers down your spine when you turn on the TV and see one of their videos.  It makes for one great experiences.  The only thing that is better than buying the CD, is buying the DVD AND the CD.  It has it all.  If you buy one CD this year, buy Morning View, you won't be disapointed.  There are some songs that you can listen to only on the radio, Morning View possesses none of these!  It is the Greatest Damn Album This Year!!
B000003TAR|4.0|This album is quite bizzare, to say the least. There are several songs that feature nothing but screaming and banging on instruments (\\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" \\"Tourette's\\") and even the quiet songs are bothersome to the casual listener with their nightmarish lyrics. This clearly wasn't made to appeal to commercial audiences. If you like Nirvana because they \\"rawk, maaaan!\\" then go buy something else. But if you like raw, intelligent music, this is just the album for you. Don't worry about the fact that lots of stupid people like Nirvana. If the band had any say in their fanbase, those ... wouldn't have even heard of them. In tearms of early 90's grunge, only Pearl Jam can top this. Very good stuff; highly reccomended. Oh, and lots of cool girls like Nirvana... an added bonus for all you lonely guys out there.
B00005JL3A|4.0|It was exactly what I expected and even a little more.  Very stylish movie with a lot of fast paced action, and Milla is hot throughout.  It seems that either most people liked it or hated it.  It is a rental for sure, and if you're like me you'll probably buy it.

B000068PQ0|5.0|On SOFT BULLETIN, The Lips' (gorgeous) music always seemed to be in a tug-of-war with their 8th-grade-poetry-journal-lyrics. So I love YOSHIMI, because on this CD The Lips' words have finally mutated into something stupid enough to be cute: A rock opera about a female robot-warrior. What weighed them down before sets them free, and they fly to alt-rock heaven on doofus wings.
B000002KKS|3.0|Heaven and Hell marked the debut of vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who replaced the immortal Ozzy Osbourne, who got fired a year later and also we have a new member of Black Sabbath the uncredited keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. The album begins with the hard hitting rocker Neon Knights, then the underrated epic Children of the Sea, the rather forgettable Lady Evil (which could've been easily penned by Cliff Richards) and the title track which is a classic. The only song that is a classic on side two is Die Young, the rest are pretty forgettable.<br />What saved this album from being a bomb is Neon Knights and the title track and if you like Black Sabbath with Dio, get The Mob Rules first, even Ozzy couldn't save this album even though he was the only frontman that I really cared for with Black Sabbath and later that summer, drummer Bill Ward leaves due to health problems.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Most every decent film critic, when listing their top 50 (or however many) comedy films of all time, will place \\"Tootsie\\" near the top.<br />The script is an absolute delight, and the acting is the best.  [How unfortunate] that Dustin Hoffman did not receive the best actor Oscar for this performance...he deserved it.  His portrayal of Dorothy Michaels is astounding....he truly makes this somewhat dumpy middle-aged woman into a real, live, breathing, wonderful, joy to behold.  <br />Do NOT miss this film.
0316666343|5.0|As one reviewer stated on the back of the novel, this is one of those books that you will see in the bookstore after you have read it, and touch lovingly, trying to remember every detail and every emotion you felt in reading it.  This is one of the most beautifully written books I have read in a very long time.  The vividness, the emotion, there is something in this sad story that just touches every part of you.  Yes, Ms. Susie Salmon is dead, and at times there is a touch of longing, regret and anger at everything that was stolen from her.  But in watching her family grow, in watching her father torn apart by her murder, her mother's growing apathy, her little brother's confusion and her dear sister's tough cynicism, Susie begins to forget what she lost and simply prays for her family's survival.  She comes to terms with wanting them to never forget her, but at the same time, she understands that they need to move on.  And in the midst of this heartbreaking story, Susie is also watching her killer cover everything up and quietly move on, yet she never expresses hatred, but rather concern for what could happen when the urge strikes him again.<BR>I have never read anything that conveyed emotions so clearly, so strongly, so convincingly.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone.  Even if you are tired of all the hype it has received over the past year, give it a shot, the hype was well-deserved.
B0000844I8|5.0|Ok, let's put it this way: faster than you can say \\"lightspeed\\", the movie itself will take you into a fantastic journey of Egypt Ancient world and the next thing you know you'll be sucked into a void. That said, this movie has been given a nice \\"touch-up\\" or re-release if you will. Making this the perfect movie to own on DVD for the first time after many years of \\"selling grapes\\". Boasting a DTS-ES 6.1 and Dolby Digital EX 5.1 sound, I'd suggest caution when playing it on your home theater cause chances are, you're gonna blow your roof down. And finally, it's been given a 16x9 anamorphic widescreen transfer, a great news for projectors and widescreen plasma TV owners. As for me, I just can't wait to get a hold of this \\"crown jewel\\". Stargate truly stands away from the crowd when compared to it's TV series spin-off. This is a great recommendation for those who are yearning for this version since the last time. Two thumbs up! Full speed ahead!

0316096199|5.0|Thankfully the success of Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones has brought her previously published and equally well-written memoir to light.  I actually read Lucky first, and was amazed at Sebold's ability to gain insight from her real life experience and put it to such great use in her later work.  Equally impressive was Sebold's amazing ability to recall and recount in such detail the experience of her rape and its aftermath.  The reader learns much about so many aspects of a survivor's experience, including the impact on relationships with family and friends, the challenges within the legal/criminal justice system, the emotional/psychological ramifications, and just what it takes to truly SURVIVE such an experience.  An inspiring read!
B00000K19E|5.0|When previews for The Matrix hit the movies, people were probably confused as well as excited. Me, I was more confused then excited. But, I put my differences aside and I fell for the &quot;what is the matrix?&quot; ploy and then I was just blown away. This movie was one of the few that I have seen that can balance science fiction, comics, hong kong action and anime films all at once. You weren't sure what you were watching at first, but you didn't care. It grabbed you and held you as you went deeper into the world of the Matrix.<BR>Yeah, it may not be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is high on the list. Even if Keanu is not an Oscar calibur performer, he is still enjoyable to watch as Neo. It's a great popcorn flick with a little philosophy and a lot of style.

0312305060|4.0|a touching, moving tribute to the mind of Virginia Woolf, which actually elevates her story to something that probably would have made her proud. While the \\"Educate everyone about AIDS\\" theme sometimes feels like it's being force fed to us (and if I see one more novel-turned-into-movie book with the cheesy actor shot on the cover, I may scream), this is an inventive, highly creative story worthy of the praise it is getting.<br />The characters are rich in development and a true insight is gained into the inner workings of their diverse hopes, dreams and failures.<br />What a mind to come up with such a crafty, ingenious plotline!
B00008972S|5.0|Viewing really old classic movies often requires watching with a grain of salt.  While I can respect a classic for what it may have been during its time period, I've been jaded by the spector of modern movies and find it hard to find entertainment in older ones.  West Side Story is an outstanding movie, even in the context of modern works.<br />In the style of \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" by William Shakespeare, the movie is the story of two star-crossed lovers whose romantic fate ends in tragedy.  Maria (Natalie Wood) is a beautiful Puerto Rican girl whose older brother is the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang called the Sharks.  Tony (Richard Beymer) is Caucasian, and a member of a rival street gang called the Jets.  Just as in Shakespeare's play, the two meet at a dance and instantly fall in love.  Because of their loyalties to opposite gangs, they try and keep their romance discreet and must meet to see each other in secret places.  There's a very cute and touching scene where they meet up in the clothing store where Maria works, and they pretend to get married.  For inconsequential reasons I cannot remember, the rival gangs decide to organize a fight against each other.  Not wanting her brother or Tony to get harmed, Maria begs Tony to try and stop the fight.  Instead of stopping the fight, Tony ends up killing Maria's brother.  Tony runs to Maria to console her and be consoled at the same time, but both the police and the rest of the Sharks are looking to hunt him down. <br />It needs to be mentioned that this isn't just a movie, but a musical.  There are several catchy songs in this picture, many of which have subsequently been referenced in TV shows, commercials, music, and other genres of pop culture.  There is also an incredible amount of choreography from beginning to end.  Even the fight scenes are choreographed to resemble ballet dances.  <br />This movie also makes a powerful statement on a number of issues including love, brotherhood, loyalty, and poverty.  Though it was in 1961, it still delivers a timely message that applies to the present.<br />It goes without saying that this movie is a must-see, and a definite necessity for any true movie lover's personal collection.

0684803356|4.0|Hemmingway opens his classic account of Robert Jordan and the anti-fascists guerillas he helps, with the surveying of a mill and bridge. Through Hemmingway's superb writing skills we find out why Jordan is on this particular mission and the basis of his mission in Spain. <BR>Robert Jordan is sent to Spain to help an anti-fascists guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. There, in the mists of war, he falls in love with the beautiful Maria. In his description of war and what the tolls of it are, Hemmingway forgets nothing. In his excellent account of El Sordos's last stand he leaves out nothing, and provides multiple viewpoints of the situation. All forty-three chapters are written without flaw and provide the reader with a true story about war and the devastation it causes. From page one to page 471 the reader's senses are bombarded with a colorful array of writing. This perhaps is Hemmingway's best work and was published at the height of his career. This book is guaranteed to give you your bang for your buck, and doesn't come close to A Farwell to Arms or The Sun Also Rises. Everyone should read this book and be exposed to one of the most influential American writers ever.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have been waiting for a long time for another good musical to come along that is up to par with Baz Luhrman's brilliant hit 'Moulin Rouge.' A musical, along with a brilliant soundtrack, 'Moulin Rouge' proved to be a hit, and so does 'Chicago.' The film is stunning, I have paid to see it three times. The songs are completely addicting, beside tracks 17 and 18 which sound like the producer's response to &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; failing miserably. Catherine, Renee, Richard, and Queen Latifah (along with Christine Biranski I should mention) all shine, and you can tell that this film and soundtrack were definitely not about the money, but about the art. It is pure fun and a definite buy for any music fanatic.
B00005JKCH|3.0|A lot of times when a classic cartoon/comic strip is made into a live-action movie, the result is unbearable. But the movie Spider-Man flowed pretty smoothly, and it had great effects that really captured the audience.<br />There were a few things I have to mention, though. Peter (Tobey Maguire) was getting irritated that his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who was also his guardian, was being too fatherly toward him, to the point that Ben said, \\"I'm not your father\\" and Peter replied, \\"Then stop acting like it!\\" It made it sound as though later in the movie we'd find out what happened to Peter's father, but we never do. Also, when Peter accepts the last-a-few-minutes-in-the-ring-with-the-champ challenge at the wrestling arena, he beats up the champ pretty quickly, and when he goes to the manager to collect his cash prize, he is only given a percentage of it because he didn't stay in the ring for the allocated time. He tries arguing with the manager without much luck. Why didn't he just beat him up for the money? He just beat up the champ, didn't he?<br />The end of the movie was also unsettling, even though that's what had to happen (you have to see the entire movie to understand what I mean). And by the way, there was one scene in the movie that really drove the point home that if a bully beats up a nerd, it's funny, but if it's the other way around, it's mean. Why IS that, anyway? Oh well, despite the other things I pointed out, this movie still has enough good moments to make it worth your while.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Way more fun than Toxicity in my opinion.  Toxicity was far too self conscious and over thought.  Even though these songs weren't written as a cohesive album, SOAD has managed to blend them perfectly.  At some points you don't know where one song ends and the next begins.  Just like their debut, I keep going back to this CD.  It just has more staying power than Toxicity, but since System won't be treating this like a new release and won't be touring for it, it will unfortunately be forgotten.
B00003CXA6|1.0|I'm not rating the movie itself, or its ingredients, I'm rating the feeling it creates. Of course, in the first place, the story it tells is a terrible nightmare that came true, just like WWI and II.<BR>Concerning, the movie : the quality of images, the light, the music, the noise,the soundtrack , the historical reports , the costumes down to the hats, the technology, all the techincal details are prefect, even TOO perfect in a way (how can I dare say that). Most actors are fabulous, the performance is great. Some scenes are excellent, some squarely bad or depressing.<BR>However, among all the sadness, I also perceived a lot of underlying irony, and I can understand part of it but I also hate it ; I felt mostly uneasy watching this movie from start to finish.<BR>The final charge of the Virginians led by Pickett is terrible and very moving; in one way it is an example of utter courage, faith and sacrifice, but such a big mistake essentially.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The charisma and effort are there, but these movie stars don't have what it takes to carry a Broadway show.  Richard Gere has noticably weak vocals and Renee Zellwigger could benefit from some serious vocal technique lessons.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the best of the three, and perhaps could pull of the show on Broadway.  The tunes are catchy and the spirit of the cast makes listening a fun experience.  The talent is definately there, if underdeveloped.  If you don't mind the lack of vocal technique or development, the soundtrack is worth your while.
0345440900|1.0|My son did not respond to this program at all. I will say I know of other babies who have, but even they are still not guarenteed nappers or full night sleepers. On Babywise, my son was sleeping 7 hours a night after the first three days and now, at 11 weeks, he is sleeping 10! As a first time mom, I relied heavily upon Babywise and it DID work. Our son is very healthy (95 percentile in all areas) and is definitely thriving....
B00006JJ1O|4.0|A friend gave me the album and i didn't know much about the girls when i first popped it in, except that i saw them when they were on TRL.   “All the things she said” was catchy and made me more into them. There's a video on the cd that was cool and def. one of the perks of buying the album.  i think they're great for girls out there b/c they do their thing and they're really good at it.  i dont really listen to their type of music hardly at all but they've gotten me much more into it.....i also got a huge kick out of them rocking out in russian, that was pretty tight.  check it out!! you wont be dissappointed.
B000059T5O|5.0|This is possibly one of the best albums ever made.  Combine an amazingly soulful and well developed bluesman with one of the best song writers of all time, and it can only mean good things.  This album surpasses even the ideas I had of what the two could do together.  You really can't describe this album in words, so perhaps I should stop trying.  If you have 15 dollars to your name, and you are hungry but you also have a cd player, use that money to buy this album.  Go to your favorite record store and buy this album right now.  You won't regret it.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I'm not a Shakira fan, but I feel that her cross over album is ok. The only thing that bothers me a bit is her not so clear lyrics. Her songs don't make any sense what so ever. I heard that she writes her songs in a form of a poem and they supposed to have a hidden message, but I feel since english is her second language, she doesn't make so much sense. Her lyrics in english lose whatever meaning they have. I don't think Shakira has a longivity in her cross over to the english market, I feel that she would make another english album but it will be poor in sales. People will forget Shakira, she's all about ... shaking.
B000066NW0|4.0|If you liked the hit 'complicated' than this album is for you. It has some brilliant material on it and can be enjoyed by all. Skater boi didnt quite match up to the standard of complicated and to me its not one of the best tracks she has writen. There are some good easy listening tracks which are catchy and sound good. If she was to eradicate the 'boy band' who look like they could do with a good wash and a set of clean cloths the videos may have marketed the album better. However her inner beauty has sold the album partly, it is difficult to say how successful she will be in the future, i think it will depend on how her music matures.
B000002U8G|4.0|Short and sweet review:  My nightly commute to my stressful job is about 30 minutes of desolate interstate.  Some nights I'll put \\"Meddle\\" in the CD player, and the 25 minutes go by fast.  30 miles in 25 minutes?  Yes, I drive fast.<br />Fighting the morning rush traffic going home in the morning is much easier thanks to the 23-minute \\"Echoes\\" track.<br />\\"Meddle\\" is probably my third favorite Pink Floyd disc, just behind \\"Animals\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  No radio-friendly hits here, just interestingly crafted music that is in such short supply lately.<br />Only drawback - my copy is from the box set \\"Shine On\\", and those albums included in that box set don't sound as good as the remastered versions that would hit the stores years later.  In fact, the volume sounds a bit muted.  But that's what the volume knob is for, right?
B00006JLX4|1.0|I bought this cd without even listening to it and let me tell you it was a waste of money. I kept skipping the tracks desperately looking for a song that I could keep on and actually listen to without getting bored and irritated. This cd is somewhere collecting dust in my room. Maybe I'll use it as a coffee cup holder. If it wasn't for bands like Spoon (whom Pavement has been compared to), I would have given up on indie rock a long time ago. Don't believe the hype.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am a recent neophyte to Johnny Cash, and I mean that in the most religious use of the word.  If you check out the Johnny Cash web site you can begin to appreciate the iconic status of Cash, which somehow I completely missed despite attending country music oriented Texas A&M in undergrad (which I am now highly resentful of only introducing me to \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" out of his entire catalogue after years of visiting country bars, etc.  And No, Clint Black, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain and the rest of the pop country crowd that I have long gotten sick of doesn't make up for it.  Maybe Dwight Yoakum and Lyle Lovette a little bit, but come on this is Cash!)  The first inclination of Cash's brilliance came when \\"High Fidelity\\" mentioned his music among all time greats.  I thought, what an odd choice.  Later, I purchased Cash's God CD just on a whim to get into some gospel music, which I really enjoyed, and got me a little more interested.  I was quite unprepared for the revelation I received from this, the latest release by Johnny Cash which happens to be a continuation of a series of albums he has done recently.  While my curiosity was initially piqued by the quite interesting choice of NIN and Depeche Mode covers (the originals are longtime favorites), little did I know that these wouldn't necessarily be the strongest songs I would find here!  Cash talks about how much time and energy he dedicated to the opening track, which is monstrous and powerful and relates all great things about Cash's talents.  (When he says \\"Hell followed with him\\" I can't help but bring up Tombstone in my mind, although I guess the bible would be more appropriate!)  And beware, Cash makes the bible and Christianity hip and cool again, because for some of us it never goes out of style!  The songs chosen are amazing, with support from people such as Fiona Apple, Don Henley, Nick Cave, and others.  (By the way, the reason Desparado and some of these other songs are on here is because people are probably beggin' Cash for years to work with them, not vice versa as others have implied.)  The version of \\"Hung My Head\\" sounds so completely like Johnny Cash that I think Sting must have just gotten through watching Unforgotten, Tombstone, and a whole bunch of other westerns in addition to listening to hours of Cash himself before writing the song, otherwise I don't know how he came up with it.  I think the top song on this album is the redone \\"Sam Hall.\\"  BLAST YER EYES (original lyric, new version would be censored) I had to go out and get the remastered original version from \\"Cash sings songs of the true west.\\"  Nothing short of superb, this album has radically transformed me into an eager fanatic, and barely whetted my appetite for the Man in Black.  I will definitely purchase the rest of the American Recordings, and additionally have found the three Bear Family Records issue of the series of Man in Black box sets covering Cash's career from 1954 all the way to 1969 on a total of 16 CDs highly desirable (which I found out about on Amazon by reading the reviews....)  ...

Charlie lives his life just normal until one day his teacher tells him that he can have surgery to make him smart and he did not reject.

0553381407|1.0|I generally prefer not to write reviews of books I have read unless I have good things to say about them. However, in this case, I felt compelled to share with other readers, other human beings, what I have learned in spite of reading this book.  I bought this book and read it hoping to feel better about my own past and difficult issues in my life. Instead, I felt much worse. I find the whole concept of placing blame on others for one's unhappiness self-destructive. Unfortunately, this is the generally accepted way of dealing with one's problems. Mental health professionals encourage us to discover our hidden demons (often creating them in the process) and place blame on others and get in touch with our anger and repeat this process over and over, purportedly to diminish their effects on us. The problem is, it simply does not work. Fortunately for me, I listened to the audio book of The Art of Happiness, by the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler, M.D. shortly after reading Toxic Parents. This extraordinary book has changed my life in so many ways. I highly recommend that every person read this remarkable book. Its basic premise is that we all arrive in this world the same way. We are all human beings, and suffering is an inevitable fact of life. But, as human beings, we share a fundamental right to happiness. It is in that realization that we find compassion for others, as well as true and lasting peace and happiness for ourselves. Placing blame leads to anger. Anger leads to hatred. Hatred leads to evils of all sorts, and is highly destructive for all humans. This book is a tool for anyone who genuinely wants to heal and achieve true happiness.
B000007MVL|2.0|This CD has the worst sound quality I have ever heard on a studio recording. The highs are really fuzzy. It sounds like an LP being played with lint on the needle. I have an early copy of the CD. No one else has complained about the sound quality, so maybe newer copies of the CD don't have this problem. I know that some of the early CD's did not have good sound quality. In the eighties, digital music magazines would rate both the music and the sound quality of new CD's. That is why some CD's advertise digitally remastered across the cover, to let you know that they are not the bad version from the eighties.<br />So, getting beyond the sound, how is the music? This is not the best of Kate Bush's albums. Some people say that it is better than the Kick Inside. The best song on Lionheart isn't as good as anything on the Kick Inside. <br />The lyrics on this CD are not very strong and the song structures are weak. On this CD, Bush really exercises her unique vocal stylings and vocal range, all in the space of a few seconds. After the powerful Kick Inside, this was a let down, especially considering its length at only 36 minutes. There just isn't much here.<br />Bush's vocals are very unique and a matter of taste. I happen to like them. But she can try your patience at times. I heard someone describe Tori Amos being just like Kate Bush but not as annoying. On this CD, there are parts with very effective interaction between piano and vocals, especially on the first few tracks.  It creates a very distinctive mood.  But, the sound quality is so poor, that you can't appreciate it.  <br />If the CD had better sound quality, I would definitly increase my rating.  And, it is very possible that the newer editions have had the sound problems fixed.
0446677450|1.0|I fell for the TV talk show hype and bought this book. It's not very good although it may have some financial advice buried in it somewhere. The book was hard to read - Kiyosaku is not a professional writer and it shows. It's not clear what his credentials are but maybe the secret to wealth generation is to do what he did and write a book about making money.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an amazing movie in every aspect. I love it dearly. Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, and Nicole's Kidman's performances are spectacular! I had no idea McGregor could sing so well! This movie has more color, beauty, and joy than any other movie I have ever seen. I could hardly contain myself. I wasn't prepared for this movie. When I first saw it, I was like a rich little kid in a candy store. I couldn't blink. The duet between Ewan and Nicole in the elephant is absolutely triumphant! I have no problem at all with the movie borrowing songs from various famous musicians; I would consider the manner in which they are presented nothing but flattering. Ba Luhrmann did a fantastic job directing this movie. The dances are wonderfully choreographed, and the fanatically frantic onslaught of quick cuts provides high, awesome energy. All you need to know about the plot is that Ewan McGregor is a romantic playwright looking for his first big hit, and once he coincidentally gets his shot, the movie takes off like a rocket into space. You have to see this movie. It's so great!!! It's one of the best movies of 2001; and one of my all-time favorites.
B00004WMYB|5.0|the best eminem cd made to date. its great. if he had more sonds like under the influence he would be a better singer. enuff said. now quit lookin and BUY IT!
B000002KBA|5.0|I first got into Deep Purple a year ago. The first album of theirs I heard was \\"Machine Head\\", and I thought it was great. But then, a couple weeks ago, I bought \\"In Rock\\". Wow! words can't describe it. It completely blew me away! The album starts off with the fast and furious \\"Speed King\\", then moves into the hardcore riffage (If that's a word)of \\"Bloodsucker\\". But the one song that you should buy this album for, if anything else, is the totally mind-blowing 10-minute epic \\"Child In Time\\". It's such an intense song it's hard to describle. It starts off seemingly mellow, and then before you know it Ian Gillan knocks you on your butt with a series of ear-shattering operatic screams, then it goes goes back to a mellow sound again, then back to the afore mentioned operatic screams, then to the mind-blowing encore. The others songs are also very good. \\"Flight of the Rat\\" and \\"Into the Fire\\" both feature excellent guitar work by Ritchie Blackmore. \\"Flight of the Rat\\" also features a incredible drum solo by Ian Paice. \\"In Rock\\" definately belongs in the home of any hard rock fan
0066214122|5.0|Crichton is back in top form. It's Jurassic Park for a post 9/11 era. Michael Crichton proves that he's ahead of the game once again. With all this talk about Biological Weapons, Anthrax, and Smallpox, this book is pretty scary. After Jurassic Park, everyone wanted to make a clone. All beware, this book WILL set the tone for technology. Crichton's knowledge is endless and he's not afraid to educate and entertain.
B00005ARDC|4.0|I like this LP, cool downbeat psychedelic rock'n'roll oldschool. This is probably my favourite music purchase of last year, its not original, true, and the songs are overly dramatic, but the guitar work and production works its for me. For myself \\"Whatever Happened to my Rock'n'Roll\\" and \\"Rifles\\" (dispite its dull pointless intro) are the best tunes. These guys are way sexier than the Strokes.
0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen was definatly not a disappointment in any way, it was a great conclusion to one of the best fantasy trilogies I've ever read. Before you read Abhorsen you should read Sabriel and Lirael. Unlike Lireal where the whole first half of the book was exposition in Abhorsen Nix drops you right into the middle of the story.<br />Lirael and Sam must journey along with Mogget and the Dog to find Nick and stop the hemispheres from being joined. Lirael and Sam must save the world while just becoming accustomed to their new jobs as the Abhorsen and a Wallmaker. Nix also throws in an interesting plot twist about Sabriel and Touchstone in the first chapter. This book pretty much wraps up all of the loose ends but I would love to see another book in the future!
B00000DFSK|4.0|This CD is a good place to start for those who have heard U2's radio hits, but don't really own any of the band's albums. All of the radio staples are here. The actual best of disc is pretty much just a walkthrough of the band's ten year meteoric run on the Billboard charts, but the inclusion of gems like the &quot;Love Comes to Town&quot; duet with B.B. King help to change things up a bit. The B-Sides album has a lot of music most casual U2 listeners have never heard. Worth owning.
B00003CX8T|4.0|This is a great Disney movie. The wit, the animation, the storyline, and characters are wonderful. There's even some suspense in here (well, suspenseful for a DISNEY movie, mind you). But, above all elements, the best thing in the entire movie is the villain, Jafar. He is the saltan's (king's) advisor, and he hypnotizes him with his staff to program him to do what he commands. Jafar is insane! He's such a cool Disney villain.  Jafar's maniacal laugh, his twisted hynotizing, his possibly implied pervertiveness, and his wisecracking parrot, Iago, makes him one of the finest Disney villains to grace the theatre. The storyline is great too, and the songs are excellent (especially Jafar's song). This is actually entertaining for adults too. I recommend it for fans of Disney movies, and for fans of Disney villains.
B000056K04|3.0|This album is probably the most famous DMB album out there simply  because of it's strange history with the Lillywhite Sessions, etc. It's not a typical sound for the band, but they do have a few gems on here that you aren't likely to hear otherwise.
B0000542D2|3.0|First off, as mentioned in another review, I was also disappointed with the packaging. Although the gatefold photo is attractive, it is awkward to handle. I also agree that more familiar original artwork similar to the original movie lobby posters would have been much better. The design of the lettering and packaging is rather bland. I was sorry to see that the footage John Lennon called &quot;the best stuff on the cutting room floor&quot; i.e., outtakes and bloopers were not part of the extras. In their place where numerous interviews with bit part actors which were intriguing but a little overdone. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but as far as the video itself, it appears to be formatted to slightly &quot;anamorphic widescreen&quot;. If that's the case, shame on Miramax for messing with the original dimensions. Lastly and most importantly, I was surprised that in the 21st century we still have to put up with &quot;stereo roulette&quot;. The impression was given that the musical soundtrack was in stereo when it is in fact mono. To add injury to insult, in the early 90's, Criterion released a laserdisc version of this movie with a true stereo musical soundtrack, and the tunes mastered at the right speed. For all the hype of this release, it's somewhat of a disappointment in this reviewer's eyes. I hope they do a much better job with &quot;Let It Be&quot; and give us the rooftop concert in surround sound stereo. Cheers !
B00005GKB5|5.0|This is a classic Blue Note from the mid-sixties (recorded on July 6th, 1964). It was released for awhile in the Connoiseur Series in the early nineties (I believe) but has been out of print since. This is a crime. All of us that love this type of music should be firing off e-mails to Blue Note demanding the rerelease of this, Moncur's other great CD, Evolution, and all those lovely mid-sixtes Jackie McLean CDs (Action, Right Now, Consequence, etc.) Music like this should never be unavailable.<br />The band on this CD is Wayne Shorter on the tenor sax, Herbie Hancock on the piano, Cecil McBee on the bass and Anthony Williams on the drums. Grachan Moncur III plays the trombone and wrote the compositions. And what wonderful compositions! They are the following (with times in paranthesis): Gnostic (11:41), Thandiwa (8:16), The Twins (12:53), and Nomadic (7:41). The heads are fairly simply but the overall group sound is unusual- spacious with thorny harmonies or just plain free. One of the things that Moncur does that I really enjoy is on Nomadic which is basically just Williams in an extended drum solo with various obligatti from the other instruments. Since this is Tony Williams this is a wonderful and fascinating piece.<BR>So get on your high horse people and fire off those e-mails to Blue Note and demand they free up this stuff! Or, at least, that it goes thru a limited release every five years or so. Music like this belongs to us all.
B00003OSSM|2.0|This movie is very dark and unrelentlessly depressing, but it is worth watching one time because of Kristen Scott Thomas's performance.  She is great at playing the part of an emotionally repressed widow who has found out her husband was having an affair.  I think it is good that a movie has been made that is trying to be different from all the other movies currently being made, but this movie is just not very good.  The whole storyline about the dirty cop that Harrison Ford is trying to track down just doesn't blend with the movie, and it made absolutely no sense in the movie.  I hope a better movie dealing with an unusual romance will be made.
B000056JYB|4.0|it falls short of being great.  I'm writing this as a huge fan of Clapton - especially his work with Cream; however, I've never been a fan of Winwood.  As much as I love \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" and \\"Presence of the Lord\\", whenever I listen to it, I lose some enjoyment because I keep hearing \\"Higher Love\\" and \\"While You See a Chance\\" in the back of my mind - and that's not a good thing for me.  Of course, if you love Winwood and like his distinctive voice, forget what I just said. Also, I got this set used for $10, so it was worth getting the \\"deluxe\\" edition, but I wouldn't pay $20+ for it.  The \\"bonus\\" tracks simply aren't that good.  In fact, I've never been able to listen completely to any of the extended jams without getting bored and skipping ahead to the next.  That said, I still like this album.  As I said, it has several tracks I love and, to my ears, it is unique to anything else done in the late 60s - you might even call it \\"ahead of its time\\".  Also, if you're a fan of Clapton and want to follow his evolution from the Yardbirds to Mayall to Cream to Blind Faith to ..., you'll need this.  It is unlike anything else he did.
B00005U122|5.0|Having seen the concert at the Bellvile Velodrome in February 2002 I think that this is a great concert. Got the DVD as soon after the concert as I could. It is not possible to describe the experience of seeing Roger Waters live. He is a genius songwriter and knows exactly how to capture emotion and atmosphere through this concert. Get it. You dont know what you are missing!
067144901X|5.0|This is such a fun book and one my daughter loves! It's the first one she memorized and now she's 2 and \\"reading\\" it to me!
B00006LLLN|5.0|Gorgeous singing, virtuosic playing, well-written songs, and a lively crowd come together in this 2-CD set recorded live in Louisville, Kentucky.  Alison Krauss is credited with crossing over from country-bluegrass to a wider audience, but I'd go one further and say she has the power to bring you back over with her, even if you never thought you liked country or bluegrass music.  I got hooked on the ballads you'd find on the \\"Forget About It\\" and \\"New Favorite\\" albums (Stay, Maybe, New Favorite, etc.), which Alison sings heartbreakingly beautifully, and with the good taste of simple accompaniment.  Those songs were so good that I was persuaded to listen to other Union Station songs.  Some jangled my non-country mind at first, but after another listen, I could hear what incredibly accomplished instrumentalists and vocalists they all are! For one thing, Alison is not only a great singer, but a great fiddler!  Jerry Douglas is a real master of the Dobro (a type of guitar specially designed to be louder and more resonant).  Dan Tyminski's singing, especially in The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn, is haunting--O, those blues-y notes and ornamentations!  You'll love the imagery of the lyrics for Ghost in This House.  But I hate to leave out Ron Block and Barry Bales, because their playing and singing are excellent, too, in solo and as part of the incredible harmonizing.  And it's really fun to hear the live crowd having such a good time!
B00005S6K8|3.0|This movie is a sweet romantic comedy but it lacks the charm which Audry Hepburn, William Holden, and Humphry Bogart brought to the original.  Additionally some of the alterations made to create a more modern film compramise the integrity of the film.  Overall I recommend the original version.  There is a reason the original has remained a highly acclaimed film for almost half a century, and this version has slipped in its renound over time.
020530902X|5.0|I have never read any other book on grammar that was remotely interesting.  This is literature.  I sometimes go back and reread the rules listed here just for the complete pleasure of reading Strunk and White's words.  With this very thin book, any writer is prepared for art as excellent as that of E.B. White.  He helps us get from Engfish to English- from writing incredibly verbose and inarticulate prose that proceeds on and on interminably with humongous words, to a precise language weeded of anything extra.  Much of what little writing skill I have I owe to this book.
B000002UDB|5.0|Sure you've heard \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"I want to Hold you Hand\\". But that isn't the Beatles who changed the world with their lyrics. That was the Beatles who lead the British Invasion. This is the real Beatles. In a way, it's rather strange that this is a movie soundtrack because it sounds so much like a regular album and I'm guessing that not to many people have seen the movie. I consider this a preview of The White Album and Abbey Road. With songs like Fool on the hill it keeps a low profile and yet still makes an impact on music from Nirvana to Radiohead to just about everything else. The beatles were and still are the band that defines music. Experience them or don't experience the world to it's fullest potential.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I wasn't quite sure, at first, what I would think of this album, for I did not know if these three lead singers could sing. I had heard that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere had started out their career on stage, but that was a long time ago and a lot can happen during those years, for if you don't keep up your voice you might lose it, but I was pleased with this soundtrack. I have seen the broadway show and it was amazing!  I didn't want anyone to mess up the musical.  Catherine has a great voice and she should keep singing.  She shines in \\"All that Jazz\\".I was impressed with Richard Gere's voice, I didn't know he had it in him.  He shines in \\"Razzle dazzle\\" and \\"All I care about\\" Now it took a couple times for me to get used to Renee's voice, for she doesn't have much of a voice, with some practice I think she could be wonderful, but the more I listened to her songs the more I did think her voice did suite this role of Roxie Hart. For she is supposed to be a sexy, seductive, marilyn monroe type voice and she has that type of a voice, which you can tell when she talks. My favorite number of hers is \\"Roxie\\". Queen latifah shines as the infamous \\"Mama\\"  and sings her heart out in \\"When your good to mama\\", I always know she had that in her and she should bring that voice out more often.  The group song \\"Cell block tango\\" is one of my favorites. The only downfalls are the remix of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and  Anastacia's \\"Love is a crime\\".  The songs in this musical are very catchy and stick in your head all day long, but in a good way.  If you buy this album, you will love it, but I would also recommend the Broadway revival cast (1996) of Chicago, especially if you like this album.
B000002UB3|5.0|The beatles are the band that defined music, and this is their best masterpiece. A more mature band at this point in their legacy, they show the unmatched progression they made over their career from song like &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;I want to Hold you Hand&quot; to &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;. This is music at it's finest. To really aprieciate the world around you, you must experience this record. The beatles changed music, lives, and the planet. Buy this.

He is also quite possibly the most entertainingly original character in all of American literature. His misadventurous exploits are unlike anything you can possibly imagine, and if you aren't careful you'll laugh so hard that you'll hurt yourself.
0312305060|4.0|It is the most beautiful written book I have read for my book club this season.    The story line and characterization, however, left something to be desire.
B00000J6AG|4.0|this cd was not what i expected. i bought this because i liked gwen stefani in south side, but thought that the rest would be dumb techno ... (dirty vegas). But i liked alot of it because there are some good beats(porcelin), some good piano(why does my heart feel so bad) and some good gosple(natural blues). overall this was prety good for techno.
B00005JLS0|5.0|Two Weeks Notice (PG-13)<br />This is not your typical romantic comedy.  George Wade (Hugh Grant) plays a millionaire playboy tycoon who's aim in life is to build as many buildings as he can while sleeping with his female attorneys.  Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) plays an intelligent Harvard educated attorney fighting against corporate greed.  <br />Wade and Kelson cross paths as the latter's beloved Coney Island community center is threatened by Wade's wrecking ball.  Wade is in search of a new chief counsel and offers Kelson the job after learning of her ivy league education and intelligence.  Without her parents' approval, she accepts the offer because of Wade's promise to spare the destruction of the community center and she will have millions of dollars at her disposal to put toward her charitable causes.  <br />The duo initially work well together but Wade becomes increasingly dependent on Kelson-asking for her opinion on everything, from picking out his wardrobe, to her thoughts on his personal stationery, to the firmness of his mattress.   Kelson hits the boiling point with Wade's dependency and gives her \\"two weeks notice.\\"  She agrees to find a replacement for Wade.  Alicia Witt stars as the beautiful Harvard educated June Carter.  Wade immediately fancies Carter and the audience can sense Kelson's jealousy.  <br />Kelson holds her own by doing what she was hired to do, she trains Carter as her predecessor.  While Kelson has feelings for Wade, she holds her emotions in tact and attempts to move on.  Wade, on the other hand, invites Carter to a business outing and the two somehow end up in his apartment playing strip chess.  Upon learning that Wade has broken his promise to save the community center due to familial pressure, Kelson is infuriated and heads over to see in Wade for answers.  There Kelson is greeted by a half dressed Carter and slightly embarrassed Wade.  Kelson, painfully hurt by what she's seen, leaves while Wade appears to have realized whathe's done.  <br />Kelson's two weeks are finally up.  She is confronted by Wade, who accuses her of being a boring saint while continuing to defend his decision to demolish her beloved building.  She's reluctant to rebut his claim but simply explains that she took the job for the community center and not to sleep with him.  <br />Kelson carries on and works at Legal Aid.  To her surprise, Wade shows up one day to inform her of his decision to not knock down the community center because of his promise to her.  Wade informs Kelson that she is beautiful and understands her fight for saving the center.  Kelson appears relieved but tells Wade that she has work to do.  A disappointed Wade leaves while coming to terms with what he's lost.  Kelson sheds tears and realizes that she can't let Wade go.  She runs after Wade, who is just as happy to find Kelson in his arms.  Wade finally declares his love for her as the two embrace one another while Al Green's \\"Love is a Beautiful Thing\\" plays on.  <br />I've seen this film four times and thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  Grant and Bullock have great chemistry.  Grant's charming British wit nicely compliments Bullock's girl-next-door persona.  The film is full of laughs and emotion with a perfect ending.  <br />Big two thumbs up!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I must say that Beck has come a long way from the \\"Two turntables and a microphone days\\" which were great but strained in my view by Beck trying to be somewhat of a cross between the Beastie Boys and Pavement (with the sound effects).<br />Through the years Beck has shown his ability to adapt his sound to be on the cutting edge of what is hip and happening in L.A.<br />I loved Mutations and his tribute to Prince (I think her name was Debra) on the Midnight Vultures album, but this new album is simply FANTASTIC.<br />The first couple of tracks kind of have a Neil Young feeling to them (don't ask me why) and the remainder of the album (with the Flaming Lips) is a tribute to great musicianship and songwriting.  (Lost Cause and many more).  I have to admit that I was NOT a Beck fan with his initial effort \\"LOSER\\" and didn't quite get the hype over some white guy with sound effects.  But upon reflection, I guess we are all entitled to change our minds.<br />This new album is his most mature effort (and still retains some of his past sounds) and puts him on the map with folk singers such as James Taylor, Neil Young, and sets him apart by not being simply elevator music today.  I think this album will have a staying power that will outlast many of his other works, and if he reads this review would ask him to play at a club like \\"Largo\\" so that we can all sit and appreciate this album.<br />If you are a fan of Jack Johnson, James Taylor, and Johnny Cash, you must hear this album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This film will make you think.  It's not a &quot;who done it&quot;, nor is it a mystery.  It's a slice of life film with some strange twists and turns.  Time travel, highschool life, new-age psycho-babble...they're all covered in this gem of a movie.  From a demonic man in a bunny costume (a rather frightening figure at that) to Patrick Swayze in a gamble of a role, this DVD leaves an impression on anyone who watches it.  As a matter of fact, this is the ONLY film I've watched, scratched my head, then watched  a second time with the director's commentary turned on (a nice feature on DVD's).  I felt that I understood half of what I saw.  For me that's a plus (I enjoy movies that make me think).  It has an awesome sound track and great 5.1 sound for you home theater fanatics.
B00006EXL5|5.0|After seeing My Chemical Romance last night on the last date of their tour with Piebald, Minus the Bear and Noise Ratchet (as of this writing, Jan 31) here in Las Vegas, NV, I was in awe of their live performance, and I wanted to hear what the songs sounded like on the recording. So off to the merch booth I went to pick up one of their t-shirt's and this CD. <br />Although I have only had it for a day, I can already safely say that I am IN LOVE with this CD. I can not understand at all why anyone would call MCR formulatic, generic, and I certainly don't agree that these songs are not catchy. After listening to this CD, I'm always left wanting to hear it again. And again. Well, anyways... All I can say is this. Download &quot;Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot; and/or &quot;This is the Best Day Ever&quot;. If you find that this isn't your particular cup of tea, then don't buy it; but I think that if you had enough interest in this band to be reading any of these reviews, I can almost gurantee you'll enjoy it.<br />OH, and by the way, if you haven't been to one of their shows already, go see them next time they go to your town. They're cool guys, and put on a helluva show. :)
059035342X|5.0|I first read this book in fourth grade and right from the start I was drawn into it. The plot is well written and imaginative and the characters are humerous and delightful. When the book ended I was reluctant to put it down. Now four years later I have read many other books but the Harry Potter Series is still my absolute favorite, I can't wait for the 5th to come out this year!
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is the first album I ever heard from Marilyn Manson. I now own each of his lps, and after five years of listening to it, Mechanical Animals is still one of my favorites. <br />I hold each of Marilyn Manson's albums as equal. If there was something that would put this album above his others, it'd undoubtedly be his vocals. They are simply *professional* here, something not true about his previous album, Antichrist Superstar. <br />This album will move you. I've cried so many times while listening to this album, it's unimaginable. It's simply beautiful. The concept of the album is great; he uses a metaphor of 'coma white', or a drug for us trying to escape reality or ourselves. The Mechanical Animals are the ones who've turned to religion, drugs, or technology...ect, to escape who they are. (...) The album is also a reflection on how fake Hollywood is. It's quite sarcastic at time, being spoke through different characters. <br />One of the most intelligent and emotional rollercoasters in Rock N Roll. The only feeling that comes close to the experience of this album is Tantra. In fact, I think this album is a metaphorical orgasm somehow. Those subliminal messages. Damn that Manson and his hidden agendas.apture such an impact.
B0000683DH|5.0|This movie will go down in history as the all time best Trek movie ever made. Khan is the all time greatest villan ever, his onscreen presence is magnificant. Highly recommended.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I don't own it, but I've watched it three times at a friend's house.  It's plain and simply impressive, and for me, there's nothing to complain about.  Very nice if you are into Marilyn Manson.

B00005JLKB|5.0|Who knew this would work?. While the WB is a wonderful network, one would be a bit hesitant when they first hear that they are going to do a show with Superman as a teen in Smallville. How many people didn't think \\"Dawson's Creek\\" meets \\"The X Files\\"?. In a way, that's what it is at times, but it's good. Really good!. While the network is the king of teen angst, this show is normal and does it well. They don't have it too much as a soap opera, and the kids don't talk like they are 45 years old. I was also skeptical when they said that Clark wouldn't fly, have a costume, or have all of his powers yet. Fans who have always known and expected this of the Superman legacy, were probably a bit worried. I was. After the first episode, your worries are put out to pasture. That said, the show is a fantastic addition to the Superman legend. The first episode is a wonderful episode telling of Clark's arrival to Smallville and being taken in by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. We are introduced to the cast of characters as well. Clark's high school crush Lana Lang, good buddy Pete, close friend Chloe, and of course, Lex Luthor. Many of the first season's episodes seemed to be the 'villain overtaken by kryptonite' kind of thing, but a lot of them are good. After the pilot, the next good episode is \\"X Ray\\", where a girl who is infected with kryptonite can metamorphis into anyone. It also appears that the girl is in love with Lana. Yikes. \\"Cool\\" is a fun episode about a kid who falls into a lake imbedded with the green K(again?!)and emerges frozen. He literally needs to suck the heat out of other people to stay alive. Another krptonite villain of the week, but an entertaining one. \\"Leech\\" has a classmate of Clark's getting Clark's superpowers after the two of them are hit by lightning on a class field trip. The results are dangerous and deadly. A really entertaining episode. \\"Crush\\" is a teriffic episode revolving around a former student who loses his hands and is able to move things with his mind. Might not sound overly original, but there are moments in this episode, especially towards the end, that make this one one of the best of the season. The best has been saved for last. The first season finale, titled \\"Tempest\\", is a great fun ride. Many things are going on with our characters, but the main thing about this one is that a tornado is hitting town. A fantastic episode. The conclusion, which is the second season premiere, is mind blowingly better. There are more good episodes here, but these are the best. Even it's weakest episodes, like \\"Metamorphosis\\", \\"Jitters\\", \\"Shimmer\\", \\"Hug\\", \\"Kinetic\\", and \\"Stray\\", are still better than most shows on TV. The production values on this show are outstanding. Many scenes are filmed in wonderful slow motion in a ' matrix ' type style that is perfectly executed. There is also the cast. Tom Welling is a perfect Clark Kent. He's not going to win an emmy, but he does a real and believeable job as Clark. He is always good to watch. His parents are played by John Schneider and Annette 'O' Toole. They couldn't be any better. They seem like real parents. They don't get a whole lot to do, but even when they don't, they are still great to watch because they are good and very likeable people. Kristin Kreuk as Lana. Wow. The first time I saw her I wanted to jump into the set. An amazing beauty. I hope the show lasts a long time because I love it, but also because we'll be able to see her every week. Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor is outstanding. He's probably the best of the bunch. He seems like a nice, likeable guy, but you can see that there could be something lurking underneath. This is pulled off well because of Rosenbaum's wonderful portrayal. It's so fascinating to watch him and Clark together and look at their relationship when you know what it will come too in the future. John Glover, as Lionel Luthor, is equally as good. The theme song, \\"Save Me\\", by Remy Zero, is another great plus to the show. Thereyou have it. This is a stylish, well made, well put together show that is non stop fun and entertaining. \\"Smallville\\" flies high.

B00005K3LU|5.0|Die Hard was always one of my favorite action movies.  It was funny, thrilling, and had a good plot that allowed for a lot of fancy special effects.  So it seemed like it'd make the perfect DVD.<BR>  First off, the audio commentary is some of the best I've heard.  Very iinteresting and imformative.  I learned a lot about the filmmaking process just by listening to it.  <BR>  There are hours of trailers, deleted scenes and television spots, all of which are expected now from DVD, but nonetheless, this is impressive.<BR>  Still, the one thing that made me purchase this DVD was the \\"Cutting Room\\" a feature that basically allowed you to direct your own scenes from the movie by picking from a number of camera angles that are offered.  The one thing that disappointed me was that of the three or four scenes offered in this extra, none of them are action scenes, and that's what I was hoping to direct.  A novel concept regardless.<BR>  The bottom line is that this is a film that was made for DVD.
B00005JKZT|4.0|\\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" turns out to be a mighty impressive second installment in the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy - quite an admission from someone who wasn't exactly the greatest fan of the first installment, \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  That film, for all its visual splendor, narrative ambition and epic scope, ultimately, turned into little more than a conventional monster movie, with the characters battling one strange creature after another to the point where the film finally became a crashing bore long before its three-hour running time was up.  \\"The Two Towers,\\" though equally long (one minute shy of three hours, to be exact), doesn't fall into this monotonous narrative pattern, thereby allowing for more variety in its story and more depth in its characterizations.<br />As someone who knows next to nothing about the specifics of the trilogy, I must say that the story can be a bit hard to follow for the non-initiate.  We aren't always sure who is who or just how the battle lines in the various good-vs.-evil conflicts fall out.  This has the unfortunate effect of making the early stretches of the film confusing and, at times, downright incomprehensible.  Luckily, the plot strands begin to straighten themselves out after not too long a time, and one can at least follow the unfolding action well enough to become absorbed in the spectacle on screen.  And impressive that spectacle is, with director Peter Jackson once again creating an entire fantasy world with the help of his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, as well as his various art directors, scenic designers and special effects wizards.<br />One of the reasons \\"The Two Towers\\" triumphs over \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is that this newest film provides us with more conflicted, more complex characters.  This is especially true in the case of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who's been entrusted with the powerful ring, but who must now struggle to avoid becoming taken over by its evil power.  Similarly, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process.  These two characters bring some added depth to all the surface magnificence of eye-filling vistas and heart-pounding adventure and battle scenes.<br />Not being familiar with Tolkien's novels, I cannot say to what extent the film is or is not faithful to the original.  I will, therefore, simply state that \\"The Two Towers\\" is a powerful and moving saga that can stand on its own as a first-rate movie-going experience.  Having nodded through the first installment of the series, I was not exactly looking forward to Part Two.  Now, having seen Part Two, I can't wait to see Part Three.y, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process.

6302518393|5.0|This has to be one of the nicest family films in a long time.  My family and I have seen this film over and over again, and not once does it seem tedious.  Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt are cast superbly as the suburban parents of three children who come across an orphaned dog (Beethoven).  Of course Charles Grodin doesn't want any of this, and the change which he goes through until the end is wonderful.  Then there's Dean Jones, the villain, and this is against casting, because he's been such a nice guy in most films.  Not this one, but his demise is expected, and fun to watch.<br />Highly recommended.  And not once do you think that this should not be viewed by the family, or with young children.  It leaves lots of room for discussion, much of the positive kind.
B00005MP58|4.0|I have to agree with the other reviews that the DVD version is a disappointment.  At first I thought something might be wrong with my tv.  The picture is absolutely drained of color and contrast.  The &quot;special features&quot; are also practically nonexistent.  I expected more from this version, especially when the movie itself is so popular and well made.
B00000I2PG|5.0|Call it what you will, but this is one of the best dance albums ever recorded. From beginning to end, it is fun! You will find yourself spontaneously dancing to this, even if you have never danced in your life. YOU WILL remember the lyrics to every song. Who said &quot;catchy&quot; can't be craft...and doggone GOOD!
B000008J3I|2.0|I do own several Mike Oldfield CDs and I like them. Great music, great sound.<br />This one is clearly not in line with the others. Quite obviously, this CD was put together on a rainy Sunday afternoon... A number of good songs where brought together, but unfortunately the result is far below what one should expect, having disbursed [$$$]. <br />The sound quality is poor (lacks detail and dynamics), and the recording engineers didn't even care to end the tracks in a decent way. Listen to the way track 1, 3, 5, 6 end. It's as if the guy fell asleep and suddenly woke up \\"uh, oh, the next track is starting. Let me quickly fade this out.\\" The end of track 5 is a remarkable kludge. Further, they did not take the time to check the levels of the tracks... you will want to reduce the volume of track 4 each time: it was recorded at a volume level far above all the others.<br />Too bad. Mike Oldfield has great music. But at times, the engineers were not at the same level. Spend your money elsewhere.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I buoght this album a couple days ago ...I took it home & listened to it.This is simply just an all around great <BR>record its not perfect but what is.If you shovel past all the ploys & what not & get right down to there talent it's very easy to see why they have sold over a million records world wide.& hey<BR>...Just give the music a chance if like club music & like to dance you will love 90% of this record this to me just as bit everything.So just buy it already.
B00006RIO7|5.0|When I saw this movie, I thought it was unbelievable.  I thought this movie was incredible and very unexpected to be this great.  What made this movie so wonderful was the music.  The singing was enjoyable as well as the dancing.  I would definitely recomend seeing the movie but the soundtrack alone feels like you are in the movie.  The songs are incredible, I recomend this music for anyone that loves Jazz music or music in general.
0451527046|5.0|Treasure Island is no doubt a good read and deserves any reader's full attention for it is filled with the most excitement and adventure.   <br />Jim Hawkins, a young boy that helps to run an inn finds himself stumbling into an adventure after another.  After the death of an old pirate that lived in the inn, he founds a treasure map in the dead pirate's chest that more than he thought are after...  He sails with his adult friends to find this treasure aboard the great Hispaniola.  When a dreadful plot of treachery and mutiny is exposed, Jim begins to see how dangerous this sea adventure really is.  Once upon the island, Jim and his friends find it harder than ever to keep grasp of life... <br />A truly great book with the classic theme that never grows old.  The old-English and pirate slang that is written in this book is a bit tricky but does not interfer with the plot and the adventure.   <br />So, all hands on deck and grab Treasure Island!
B000066NW0|5.0|This was a very good CD. I loved all of the songs, Avril has a very powerful voice and her songs sound like they're from her heart. <br />She is not as low as Britney, she is not punk, she has her own style and I like it. If you are ready for a very good CD then Let Go is the one for you, I love it!!!
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl Crow is a truly reliable performer in today's music scene and C'mon C'mon i certainly no exception.  The recording consists of energetic rockers and soothing ballads.  The leadoff track Steve McQueen is probably the strongest track as it brims with energy and atittude.  Soak Up The Sun was the first single and certainly has some catchy lyrics.  However its overplay on the radio has certainly not made it one of my favorite tracks.  I tend to prefer touching tracks like Diamond Road as well as Safe and Sound as well as the edgy Lucky Kid.<br />Sherly Crow utilizes the talents of Lenny Kravitz, The Dixie Chicks, and Don Henley to optimum success on this puppy.  I also appreciate the balance between rockers and ballads and even the little dynamics that exist on many of the tracks.<br />Not quite on the same level as Sheryl's 2nd CD but still a good addition to most CD collections.
0425180638|3.0|Although The Last Precinct is not the first time that Cornwell has revealed a new nemesis for Dr. Scarpetta in an ending rather than the beginning of a book (cf. Temple Gault in Cruel and Unusual), I find the application in this instance, sloppy in the extreme.<br />The abruptness of the revelations at the hotel is completely at odds with the weighty slow-pacing since early in Black Notice. I found this brevity of resolution to old loose ends, unsatisfying in the extreme.<br />To further compound this problem, the resolutions are simultaneously presented with the prospects of future problems for the good doctor, namely how could she possibly confront an entire organised crime syndicate by herself? (okay fine, with a small collection of allies, but still... she's not even tight with the FBI anymore)<br />I was not as bothered by the way this pivotal chapter at the motel ended, as I was dismayed, frustrated, perhaps even angry, at the way that it continued. To just go ahead and fast forward by 2 weeks, past what is potentially THE MOST interesting part of this story, is a travesty!<br />At the very least the story could have ended exactly where it was after the motel scene, with the promise of a rivetting, proper continuation in the next book. If leaving a loose ending was deliberate to encourage sales of the sequel, then wouldn't a sensational ending like this serve the purpose infinitly better? Many readers would have been left wondering and hoping for the sequel.<br />Instead, the conclusion robs us of a proper treatment to the aftermath at the motel, where so much was revealed and so much introduced, all but so quickly. Sure, the sequel(s) will undoubtedly present us with excessive references to this incident, indeed the fallout will probably hang about as persistently as the topic of Carrie Grethen when she was out of sight (locked up / slain), but all the telling will be in the past tense by then, and that's never going to have the same impact as it could've had.
B000069HKH|5.0|The reunion of Bruce Springsteen with The E Street Band on The Risin' is a smashing success.  A majority of the songs are very captivating and brewing with varied styles.  Worlds Apart utilizes some mesmerizing world/middle eastern beats and passionate vocals by the Bruce man.  Further On Up The Road, Mary's Place, and Lookin For A Sunny Day are charming rock n roll numbers while Into The Fire, City Of Ruins, and Nothin' Man are more introspective ballads.<br />What really stands out on the release is the messages that come across in nearly every song.  Bruce seems to say that life can throw you curve balls.  But in the end you need to RISE UP and let your Strength become Strength and your Hope become Hope.  Its inspiration like this that sets Bruce Springsteen head and shoulders above many of his peers.<br />Of course the E Street Band is in fine form particularly the Mighty Max.  Some good guitar solos by Bruce and some creative touches on the keyboards.  I am not sure if it is Danny Federeci or Roy Bittan but the work is still pretty good.  And teh harmony vocals are top notch.<br />Definitely a highlight from the year 2002.
0790737345|5.0|As a person who is yet to see Wings of Desire, I had nothing to compare this movie to. I didn't need to, I just loved it. I am just sorry that it was treated like just another 'chick-flick' as it was so much more than that. The story stems from the Wings of Desire movie and that wasn't a Hollywood movie so it is unfair to compare based on the storyline. The cinematography may wreak of Hollywood but look past that and into the story and you will find very special messages. <br />Seth and Maggie are lovely characters. Maggie is like so many of us, not sure what she wants in life, not sure who's hands life is in, confused as to why things happen beyond her control no matter how hard she tries. I am certain you too have asked yourself these questions at some point. If you have recently lost someone close to you, this movie can do nothing but reasure you that they are fine whether you believe that there is any truth to this 'idea' of what happens when you die. <br />I had lost my grandfather only a couple of years before I saw this film. I have a belief that there is life after death but questioned it after he died. He meant so much to me and then I saw this film. I felt him watching it with me. I am not a movie crying person but couldn't help but weep throughout so many parts of this film. <br />Not being a fan of Nicholas Cage, I dreaded the idea of watching it because of him, but adoring Meg Ryan as a fabulous and convincing actress, I decided to drag my boyfriend to see it. THe idea that there are these angels around us, reasurring us and helping us throughout our lives and keeping us company as our lives pass from this existence to the next just made me feel very reasurred about death. It helped me to believe that my grandfather was not alone when he passed.<br />The film itself is so beautiful. The way that the angels were never human and Seth's craving to know what it is to be human and alive. I love Maggie's character as she is so willing to trust this unusual stranger that enters her life. She is not willing to dismiss him as 'nutter' and realises that there is a peace about Seth and an intelligence but also a mysterious innocence about him. Nicholas Cage manages to show this innocence so excellently that I found it hard to separate him from his character at some points. <br />This heart tugging, emotional, beautiful film will touch anyone if they just open themselves to it. It was just a refreshing view on angels, not conforming to the idealistic view that angels are white (not in a racial sense but in clothing) and silvery with wings and sing. It is external to these stereotypical portrayal of Angels. Instead they wear black clothes covered in long black overcoats. They were never human and cannot touch or feel physical things although they do have feelings and emotions. Necessary of course. Seth is different. He falls in love with Maggie, a human and a mortal, and craves her touch and to experience normal life, to feel pain and hunger and true love and to be with her.<br />Their journey to understanding each other is just... beautiful. I know I have used that word far to often in this review but it is the most accurate word to describe this unique take on angels.
B00006DEF9|5.0|&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; has the now infamous scene with Gene Kelly himself, dancer extraordinaire, splashing through puddles and singing about the bubbly feeling that love brings you. Everyone knows that scene, and many have imitated it since. I wonder how many people have sat down and truly had a good looksee at this extraordinary picture.<br />First, what's amazing is that this film was written just to string together a set of songs. The story of Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies is showcased simply but brilliantly with grand comic overtones. The comedy works, the songs add to the story, and it is seemless. Oddly, even the &quot;Broadway number&quot;, a ballet added to the middle of the film, seems out of place but wonderfully innovative and compelling.<br />Gene Kelly pulls off a tour de force performance as Don Lockwood, smitten star who shined brightly on a young Debbie Reynolds in her first starring role. Equally impressive, Donald O'Connor in an invisible but wonderfully played role of Cosmo, and Jean Hagen as the horrible Lena Lamont.<br />The transfer to DVD is impressive. The movie's never looked better and comes loaded with extras. The commentary track was interesting to listen to, but ultimately disappointing. If you watch the &quot;Making of...&quot; documentary on disk 2, you end up hearing many of the same comments, so it seems they just took comments and stuck them through the movie. Why not put Donald O'Conner and Debbie Reynolds in front of the movie and have them comment throughout?  The winner of disk 2 is an hour and a half documentary  on Arthur Freed and his impact on movies, which had me mesmerized. Also, film clips of the orginial songs as they were first performed was delightful.<br />Overall, this is a great buy. I love being able to jump to my favorite scenes (Good Morning and Moses Supposes get played the most!), and never tire of this classic. Voted the 10th best movie ever made, watch &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; and see why!&quot; and see why!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Like so many of the reviewers, I came across Norah Jones almost by mistake. The TV was on in the background and 'Don't know why' came on and I was drawn to watch and listen. Nothing could have interrupted my enjoyment. Her voice has a gentle huskiness to it. I had no idea who her parents were but after buying the album and loving it, some research on her was definitely called for. It appears her Jazz/Blues singing mother is her complete influence. Norah has gotten where she is on her own. She uses her mothers surname to differentiate herself from her father and I like that. She wants to succeed on her own merit and I find that in itself very admirable.<br />On the album itself, I adored Don't know why, Come Away with me and Nightingale (her own composition). Most of the songs were not however, written by her. I don't see this as a problem. She has included some of her own songs on the album and rightly so. The fact is, she manages to sing these songs with ease and grace. You can feel the emotion her voice adds to the songs. It is so easy to just relax and enjoy a soothing bath with her voice resonating through the room. She may not have an incredibly powerful voice but it is just as difficult to sing so softly as she does. If you had never seen her face or did not know her age, you would think her older as her voice sends messages of a much more mature tone and almost speaks experience of so many years behind her. You would swear she had a lifetime of singing behind her which is incredible for someone so young. <br />My only reason for knocking off a star is because a couple of songs, 'Seven days' and 'One flight down' just do not match the albums style. They feel like filler songs and I hate that. I don't think there was any long winded songwriting sessions involved in writing them and I think they drag the album down just a tad. <br />Other than that, I loved it. I look forward to future Norah Jones productions with baited breath. I recommend it as a nice relaxingtheme to a laid back evening and as a 'one to watch for' artist.

B00003CXI1|1.0|I've resisted seeing this film for a year. Having read and enjoyed the books, I thought the movie would pale next to my imagination, the view of Hogwarts I see when I read the book. But then I heard that the second movie had Kenneth Branaugh, etc, and I thought, \\"Maybe I should see the 1st film after all.\\"<BR>Bad decision.<br />This is the most horrendous adaptation I have ever seen. The magic of the book is that you see the world unfold through Harry's eyes, you get to know characters in depth, you laugh at the witty dialogue, you see the characters living daily life at Hogwarts, and along the way, you solve a mystery (complete with suspense, clues, red herrings). The books work because we know what Harry is thinking, and these thoughts move and entertain us.<br />The cinematic challenge is to accomplish this interior dialogue on film. This movie has none of this magic. Chris Columbus, the director, seems to think that Harry Potter is primarily an action movie. He gives us all of the plot elements that we need to get to the end of the story, but he misses the point. This is the story of Harry growing up. There is emotion here. There are moral lessons. There is kindness and generosity. And it's these qualities, not luck or talent, that allow Harry to prevail at every turn. <br />To make matters worse, the script is just awful. I would have loved to see dialogue that really captured the characters -- Percy, Hermione, Nevil, Ron. The screenwriter wasn't even capable of creating a script that made sense. Among the things we don't ever learn: what the different houses represent, how the house competition works, who wins the Quidditch Cup in year 1, etc. Of course, I know these things from the book, but to eliminate them makes for a terribly stilted and nonsensical script.<br />Look, I know that the Harry Potter series is popular, and I am glad that some people have enjoyed this movie. I don't begrudge them that. I'm just writing to warn those few people who loved the book but haven't yet seen the movie... Don't bother. In about twenty years, some talented director and screenwriter will come along and make a new Harry Potter film that does justice to the book. Someday, someone like Peter Jackson will make a film about Harry Potter that captures the real magic of a boy growing up in interesting surroundings, solving fascinating mysteries, and learning about himself in the process. Until then, don't bother with this film.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have seen it six times so far.  I can't wait for it to come to DVD.  I am also looking forward to the next movie, Return of the King.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.  If you liked the first movie.  You will love the latest installment of the Lord of the Rings.  There is more action and special effects.  If you haven't seen it yet, go see it.
0060934913|5.0|People seem either to love his writing (me, for example) or hate it (my wife), but that's almost an irrelevant opinion. The best writers can take you into a world you know nothing about and make you see it, smell it, and taste it full force.  Tony Bourdain does that, and if you don't like what's there, you owe that realization to his brilliant writing.  It's funny, scatalogical, quirky, male (my wife's judgment, and it's probably accurate), sometimes irritating, and yet it always pulls you into his world.  It's a trip through his life and his profession, with chapters that frequently could stand on their own, and were probably written that way.  Still, the overall impression is of a long, funny, interesting trip through one chef's life and world.  Absolutely superb.
0792846443|5.0|This movie kept me going better than any other movie I have ever seen.  Being a Kathy Bates fan to begin with, I was thrilled to see her playing the role, although by the end I had ill feelings towards her.  She is SUCH an extrordinary actress, and I feel that she totally deserved an academy award for her performance.  Two thumbs up.  James Caan also portrayed his character stupendoulsy, drawing you into the movie, making you forget that it is indeed a movie.  I never did read the book, but I probably will, eventually.  I highly recommend it to ANYONE who is ready for a good thriller/horror.  Excelllent movie!
0060976624|4.0|Nick Naylor, the protagonist of Christopher Buckley's \\"Thank You for Smoking,\\" gives new definition to the term \\"antihero.\\"  Despite his position, he's not really a bad guy.  Sure, he makes six figures a year lying through his teeth as the chief lobbyist at the Academy of Tobacco Studies in Washington, but he's not really making anybody smoke cigarettes.  As he explains it, he's just moderating between two competing groups, namely the cigarette companies and the anti-smoking zealots.  Besides, someone's got to pay the mortgage and his son's prep-school tuition.  Even he realizes that his rationalization sounds like something a Nuremberg defendant might say (\\"I vas only paying ze mortgage\\"), but it takes a certain courage to go on TV and say there's no demonstrable link between smoking and disease.  Perhaps Buckley's greatest achievement here is that he can take a guy who lies to sell cigarettes and make him into a sympathetic figure.<br />Nick Naylor's life provides the basis for Buckley's often hilarious look at the \\"neo-puritanism\\" of mid-nineties America and the attempts of tobacco companies to fight it.  And although I hate cigarettes, I think a book like this needed to be written.  Anybody who's ever been repulsed by those ridiculous \\"Truth\\" ads where a bunch of obnoxious young people harass those who make and sell cigarettes should get a good laugh at Buckley's portrayal of the sanctimonious forces of political correctness.  As Nick tells Oprah Winfrey in one uproarious scene, cigarette opponents aren't above manipulating children and trying to tell everyone else how to think.  And anything that takes the wind out of the sails of political correctness is fine by me.<br />Much of the book's humor comes from Nick's lunch meetings with his friends in the Mod (an acronym for \\"Merchants of Death\\") Squad.  Composed of Nick, alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, and one-armed gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss, the Mod Squad is sort of a combination support group and mutual admiration society.  In the presence of their own, the three death merchants can work on their PR strategies, discuss their latest misfortunes at the hands of the neo-puritans, and compare just how much death they've caused and how hated they are.  In one particularly humorous scene, Polly and Bobby Jay are saying how much hate mail they get, and Nick just scoffs and says, \\"HATE mail?  ALL of my mail is hate mail.\\"<br />Of course, even satires need plots, so Buckley throws in some intrigue regarding a plot to have Nick killed.  When a team of killers kidnaps Nick and covers him in nicotine patches, Nick finds himself suspected by the FBI of having done the deed himself as a PR stunt.  In an effort to clear his name, Nick eventually traces the attempt on his life to a conspiracy in the upper levels of the tobacco lobby.  Although this plot had possibilities, it felt somewhat underdeveloped to me.  At a mere 272 pages, \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" isn't quite long enough to function effectively as both a satire and a thriller.  The plot's pretty interesting, I just would've like to see a little more space devoted to it.<br />Still, this book is worth a read.  It's fast-paced, well written, and remarkably perceptive.  More than once I found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all.  If an avid non-smoker like myself can find himself rooting for a tobacco lobbyist, than anyone can.ration society.

B00005MP58|5.0|I own this film series, and watch it over and over and over again. I never tire of the relationships, the landscapes, the personalities. It's a lovely, lovely film, and an exquisite place to go when real-life stresses are getting me down. The intelligent, valued, athletic, independent Elizabeth, and the equally bright but much more mysterious and troubled Darcy are a pair to watch. How their relationship builds over the course of the story is never boring - the ups and downs, combined with the accomanying subplot storylines, keep my interest time and time again. And the elements that backdrop the story - the costumes and scenery - are beautiful in and of themselves. Obviously, I give this film the highest rating available. Watch it when you, too, need to escape for awhile...
B000065U1N|5.0|hey it was possible in this movie that there was an all-white division.  The Rangers were all-white men when they were in Moghadishu.  You say how you know that there were other soldier's whose races weren't just white.  Well you're wrong there, Task Force Ranger (Delta,Rangers and Nightstalkers) were all white men.
B00005JL9B|4.0|Action, comedy, violence, drama, suspense, romance...and did I say violence? This is probably one of the most violent movies I have ever seen, but that's a given through the premise: 50 high school students must kill each other or die. The thing is, every death in the film is on screen. Fukasaku pulls no punches in this one. <br />If you've never experienced Japanese cult cinema before, prepare to see things you've never seen before. The strongest thing this movie has going for it intellectually is the psychology between the characters, from the pacifists to the bloodthirsty insane. It's such an interesting concept that the movie would still be excellent without the over-the-top violence. My major complaint with this one is that the movie relies too heavily on shock value, and by the end it has worn off, and thus the finale has less of an impact. <br />Despite this single complaint, I urge you to watch it on divx or import it, you won't be disappointed.
0553212737|5.0|This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love.  Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!
B00004RYT1|1.0|I don't know why the Amazon review above says that this is the original aspect ratio (widescreen).  The original movie was NOT shot in widescreen.  I have the old VHS tape and the new DVD to prove it.  Compare both the VHS tape and the DVD and you will see that they cut off the bottom and the top for the DVD to make it look like it was shot in widescreen.  Hitchcock would be horrified!    After all the trouble he went through storyboarding every camera shot.....
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I'm one of those in-betweeners, and by in-between I mean between dance and pop, and this is a perfect blend of it. It actually has some substantial lyrics which as you probably know is a rarity for dance music. On the other hand, the beat is deliciously catchy, so I can't help but always have the songs in my head. Would have given it 4 stars if they would have included more original songs, and less Russian/remixed versions of the first few songs on the album. Great for a US release, though! This is definitely a buy.
6305041156|5.0|Think true masterpiece.  And not in the way the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; is tossed around these days.  Think Proust's &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.  Think Picasso's  &quot;Guernica&quot;.  This is not easy entertainment but a multi-layered epic with a tangled web of complex themes.  This film is an experience - an experience rich in countless rewards.  I pray that reviewer Blakes_Angel from PA is an adolescent and will one day come to appreciate the difference between soda pop and a fine bottle of aged port.
6305513406|4.0|Ok, lets not mince words here. If your buying these like I am, you doing it because you liked the show. And you'll probably like these epidsodes. With edisode 2, it's alittle surprising to see how young everyone looked, and I couldn't help noticing a major difference in the design of the bridge and Spock's eyebrows betwwen episodes 2 and 3. The uniforms seemed to magically change alitle too. It seemed as though they weren't completely ready to do the show when they did the first two episodes. The abrurt changes in episode 3 do kind of make it seem cheesey. <br />     Another downside to this that I noticed is that it seems as though the volume level isn't constant. Perhaps this is a result of the re-mastering and conversion to Dolby 5.1. The music was much louder than the voices and I found myself adjusting the volume constantly. Image quality is better than I remembered from seeing it on T.V, but is still obviously limited due to the original source tape. <br />     In summary, if your a Trek fan, which I am, and you like the original series, which I do, this is a great way to bring it back again. It's no longer shown in sydication where I live, so this is great way for me to get to see it again. However, If you expect the absolute greatest picture and sound possible by today's standards, your not going to get it. These haven't been made over again, just digitized and put on DVD. The limitations of early video recording methods are stiil evident. You just can't get here from way back there.<br />Henry T Anderson, Jr.- Trekkie
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This romantic comedy is one of the best films ever made. The performances of Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are spectacular and unforgetable. A must seen movie.
B000002VCO|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's 1984 release, &quot;Ammonia Avenue,&quot; is definitely one of their best albums. Following the highly-successful &quot;Eye In The Sky,&quot; &quot;Ammonia Avenue&quot; is yet another winning blend of this excellent studio group's progressive pop/rock, anchored by writer/producer Alan Parsons and his partner, singer/composer Eric Woolfson. Great songs are everywhere---the radio hits &quot;Prime Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Don't Answer Me,&quot; the catchy &quot;One Good Reason,&quot; the excellent melodic rock of &quot;Dancing On A Highwire,&quot; the dreamy instrumental &quot;Pipeline,&quot; and the lovely title track that closes the album. The tunes are memorable, the vocals by such singers as Eric Woolfson himself, Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow &amp; Colin Blunstone are first-rate, the musicianship from such Project regulars as guitarist Ian Bairnson, drummer Stuart Elliot, et al, is tight, and Parsons' 80's polish to the production is sparkly. &quot;Ammonia Avenue&quot; is an excellent album from Alan Parsons &amp; company. You can't go wrong purchasing this one. :-)

B00006CXXU|3.0|\\"Genie in a Bottle\\" was saturating the airwaves around the time that Britney's saccharine \\"Sometimes\\" was making little girls cry and swoon. But I have a feeling that the \\"Teen Pop Era\\" (98-2001) is on its last legs. And it seems that Aguilera's producers and song writers are aware of this too. \\"Stripped\\" is a calculated effort to try and win over some more mature (read, without acne) listeners. And it just might work. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is a tough feminine anthem for the new millenium or something. The title track isn't really about Christina stripping down to her undies although she's doing that a lot these days. There's the odd saccharine ballad on here (\\"Beautiful\\") but the single \\"Dirrty\\" is clearly intended for knocking boots. Or something. It should be noted that Christina \\"co-wrote\\" most of the tracks on this album. Like I've said before, that's industry lingo for \\"We let the girl contribute some ideas and we didn't trash ALL of them.\\" If Aguilera ever actually wrote a song on her own, it would probably be pretty awful. Just because the girls got pipes doesn't mean she's creative. <br />I don't particularly like this album but I can appreciate what they're trying to do here. Addenda: The Junior Idol show on Fox is only going to create more Aguileras.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The only problem i have with this DVD which is exceptional, is that thier are no deleted scenes. A monster hit like this movie couldn't have been perfect. Thier had to be stuff left on the cutting room floor and they even talk about it in the feature commentary, they could have included that in the DVD.
B00006I9HJ|3.0|(Note: This is a review of the U.S. version which I received a promotional copy of.  As such, it does not include the &quot;bonus&quot; tracks). With &quot;Let Go,&quot; the edge is off Nada Surf in a big way!  Maturation is one thing, but some fans would definitely not even be able to discern that it is indeed Nada Surf on a blind listening test.  Along with an inarguable loss of rockiness, the songwriting and production are both much more homogenized/pasteurized/single-phased than all earlier CD releases. I would be surprised if most regular listeners appreciate the dedication to this new &quot;direction,&quot; but I could be wrong.  If you like Nada Surf's softer side, though, you might well love this CD.  Perhaps it will grow on me with time.  If you like NS's hard side better, I would strongly advise you to listen to the song excerpts on the Web before buying.  This is most definitely not a terrible product, just much different than I expected.  If you happen to like Travis, this is most assuredly the Nada Surf CD for you.  For new listeners, buy &quot;High/Low&quot; and &quot;The Proximity Effect&quot; first (4 1/2 stars each).  This CD is between 3 and 4.  If you like the heavier side of Nada Surg, I would heartily recommend The Contrast's latest CD, &quot;Wireless Days,&quot; as well as the Contrast's self-titled earlier CD.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When Tolkien's epic fantasy came to life on the big screen, it did so with a bang.  But as with any movie, superb acting and cinematography are nothing without a great soundtrack.  Thankfully, Howard Shore delivers to us one of the greatest soundtracks in recent movie history.<br />Words do it no justice...you have to experience the soundtrack for yourself.  It is powerful, emotional and moving, as well as inspiring.  Each individual song has a running theme.  Fans of the movie can simply listen to the soundtrack and place the exact event from the film in their minds right then and there.  Popular artists such as Enya also contribute to the soundtrack, with exclusive songs and back-up vocals to some parts of the track.<br />I have two gripes with the soundtrack, however.  One is music related...not all the tracks from the movie are included.  There are a number of follow-up segments and individual pieces of music in the film that were simply not brought over to the soundtrack.  Its too bad really...those short but sweet musical pieces would've been a fine compliment to the overall soundtrack.<br />My second gripe is about the cd's special content...none of it pertains to Lord of the Rings.  Its all Enya related content.  Granted, Enya is a talented artist, but I didn't buy the cd because of Enya, I bought it because I love the LotR soundtrack.  You get Enya wallpaper, Enya screensavers, Enya buddy icons, links to Enya related websites, but very little Fellowship content.  It is very disappointing.  <br />The Limited edition is little more than red leather-bound casing with cardboard sheathing inside to place the cd.  You should be careful, because the paper case may scratch the cd if you mishandle it.  There is gold foil embossment of the Lord of the Rings title on the case, otherwise there are no bonus tracks or content on the Limited Edition.  But that doesn't matter...you're a collector and a fan of LotR...that's why you would buy the Limited Edition.<br />Don'tlet the disappointing special content sway you from the purchase of this cd...this musical score is among the best ever recorded for a feature film.  Even if you have never seen the movie, purchase this cd if you are a fan of classical, contemporary music.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson is definitely one of the most powerful (and controversial) figures in popular music. Aside from the alleged sex abuse scandals, plastic surgery and countless other stories about him, he's made some of the most enduring music to be heard. _Thriller_ and _Bad_ are certified classic albums released during the 1980s. Entering the 1990s, he makes an updated, funky, catchy and addictive album with loads of dance grooves - without losing any of the passion he always injects into his music. However, with the updated production, it still sounds like Michael Jackson...with all those hypnotic vocal nooks and crannies found lurking in many of the tracks, period!<br />Songs like \\"Jam,\\" \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" and \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\" are so funky and downright exciting and energetic, they should get many lovers of energetic dance grooves jumping. Sex-tinged numbers like \\"In The Closet\\" and \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" show off Michael's latent sexual interests. There's also diversity to be found (Michael always possessed a certain diversity.) Slower, poignant numbers like \\"Heal The World\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\" are almost certain to tug at your emotions. The former is mainly a \\"wordly\\" pop anthem with it's earthy, mellow melody. All this changes when the choir comes in near the end of the song and a pattern of two semitones are increased from the standard, backing keys twice during the song. The vocal/choiral crescendos send shivers down my body. The latter track some will recognize from the movie \\"Free Willy.\\" Like the former track, it mostly begins softly featuring Michael's plaintive vocals, exotic percussion and the hushed vocals of a choir. Later, you know it'll progress to an emotional high, as Michael goes through this passionate and almost crying vocal performance, backed by the heavenly choir in full-effect by now. Both these tracks nearly send me to tears.<br />I've always admired Michael Jackson and the music he's made, even with all the scandals, rumors and other stories that have bogged the airwaves. Let's hope he continues to make music for another 30 years or so.mors and other stories that have bogged the airwaves. Let's hope he continues to make music for another 30 years or so.

B000002H33|4.0|I am not taking anything away from this album.  It is a great cd recorded by great musicians.  According to many people, though, this is Metallica's only truly great album.  They are so wrong.  Metallica has so much other great work that people just simply pass by and go straight to 'master of puppets'.  All of you people like this are missing out on so much.  The only reason you say this is the best and say that Jason Newsted has none of the talent Cliff Burton had is because they feel that it would be disrespectful to say that Jason is just as good of a bass player.  Here's some advice:  stop all the &quot;sold out&quot; mess and go by the newer Metallica along with the old.

B00005YXZH|3.0|I don't mind musical exploration if it makese some sense -- I'm a big Frank Zappa fan, for example, but I could never get with Captain Beefhearts' \\"Trout Mask Replica\\".<br />In spite of the massive critical acclaim, I feel Wilco is breaking away from what they do best (as on their albums \\"A.M.\\" and \\"Being There\\"), and going into Pink Floydesque flights of fancy.  This isn't totally horrible (though I can't bear Pink Floyd), but it makes for an uneven record.  I can only think the critics were trying to make up for overlooking Wilco all these years with a glowing review when they didn't earn it.  If you like sports, it's kinda like All-Star voting -- many times you'll see atheletes voted onto the team in the midst of a mediocre year.  I think Wilco earned critical acclaim for \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in much the same way.<br />Many of the tracks are good (e.g., Jesus, etc., Kamera, etc.), and one, \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\", is more poppy than I'm accustomed to hearing from Wilco, but very fun and very good.  I'd recommend this record, but it's not representative of their work.  I'd start with the CDs I mentioned above, and even go back to Uncle Tupelo -- the band that spawned both Wilco and Son Volt.
B00006M183|3.0|I actually have liked the band's transition away from the louder Seattle grunge sound into more complex ballads and mellodies on No Code and Biannural.  This album has a mix of old and new with no real outstanding examples of either form with the exception of all or none which is up there with all the PJ greats. Biannural,Yield, and No Code blow this album away. I hope this is not the beginning of a long decline for the band as they have given me so much enjoyment over the years.  That said, 3 stars because even bad PJ is still not bad music.
B0000639FE|5.0|Renee Zellweger, the best actress of her generation, appears in her first big-time role in this movie. Just looking at her facial expressions is worth the price of admission. However, I'll spare you the review of a movie you have probably already seen. Let's talk about the special edition of the DVD.<br />First, the sound and picture are first rate. This is why you watch DVD's.<br />But, the special features are why you want this version of Jerry Maguire. The deleted scenes are great and, while brief, the (obviously very early) rehearsal scenes are fun. However, I thought the best special feature was when Crowe and the three stars sat down to watch the film, with a running commentary.<br />There are two ways to get this commentary. On disk one, which is the feature, you can turn the commentary on and off. I recommend you just use this disk to watch the film; because the commentary is only a voice-over. The session with the film principals on disk two is more fun, because you actually see them, gathered together to watch and talk: Cuba, Tom, Renee, and Crowe. The film is in a window below. Since their remarks are the point, it makes more sense to watch it this way.<br />I wish more of my favorite films had the extras that are on this DVD. Of course, the extras only add more depth to the movie that is already there. If you didn't like this film, why would you want to see more about how it was made? But, if you liked the movie or, if you are just crazy about Renee Zellweger, like me, you'll love this DVD.<br />This is a great, great DVD package. Highly recommended.
0316666343|5.0|Very beautiful and emotional book. I was captured by the first chapter and could not let it go...much like Susie didn't want to let go of her loved ones. It really struck a nerve in me about souls all around us still holding on and watching their loved ones below. I swear I went through a box of Kleenex!
B000002L9B|5.0|Prince surpased Jimmy,James,Clinton and Elvis a long time ago in my opinion. The mans boundaries are endless and this album proved it. This is the most exotic group of songs with so much elegance and class! This is a Classical album done in the art of a funky Mozart! This is a timless cd just as all of his others. &quot;I wonder you&quot; is so ahead of it's time. &quot;Do you lie is beautiful, &quot;Girls and Boys&quot; is just funky with so much class and instrumentation. This mann is amazing I could go on and on reviewing his cd's but I will stop at this on. Prince has 20+cd's so we would be reviewing for ever. I own everything and after you hear this cd ...I sure you will too. I wish some one would rerelease Jill Jones's debut and The Family ! Actually &quot;The Family&quot; is a continuation of this cd it has the same theme and sound. (All produced by the one and only &quot;Prince&quot;.<br />Arish
B00007BHOE|5.0|Slipknot have just proved themselves to be the best live act in the world. I must admit I was sceptical, I've never been a huge fan, I've never sat in my room singing Heretic anthem into the mirror, I've never sat on the couch pretending I was Joey with two pencils... Aww who am I kidding... The minute I put this DVD in my player I was brutalized by Slipknot. I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't jump around on the couch singing along to Left Behind with my remote firmly clutched in my sweaty palm. Probably the most accessible and user friendly metal act in the world, I was glued to my TV while I watched them beat London to death. The crowd was massive and crazy. I'm sure a good Metallica fan from 1988 would have no trouble punishing the teenaged bogans and making their way to the front, but lets be realistic here. This DVD is the best thing since sliced bread. You'll hardly be able to contain yourself when you put it in your player. Remember all this praise is coming from a person who never really loved Slipknot (until now) so it's a totally un-biased view.

0060931671|5.0|Thomas Pynchon - The Crying of Lot 49<br />It says something about Thomas Pynchon that \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\", by all reports a straightforward book, is, by Pynchonian standards, an oddity. For a writer who has built a reputation on constructing labyrinthine tomes that endlessly branch off for pages and pages until the reader wearily abandons any attempt at deciphering a plot, \\"Lot 49\\" is, well, linear. By far the most accessible of Pynchon's works \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is also probably his most concentrated. So short that it is often referred to as  novella, \\"Lot 49\\" manages to get at Pynchon's BIG IDEAS and even contain some of his delightfully controlled chaos.<br />It is the story of Oedipa Maas, summoned to California's San Narcisco to fulfill a duty to left her by some shady inheritance, namely to oversee the execution of a rather large estate left by the newly deceased Pierce Inverarity. Immediately Oedipa finds herself overwhelmed by the size and complexity of Inverarity's estate, and hopelessly imagines that she will never get Inverarity's affairs straightneed out. No sooner does she lose hope than Oedipa meets an odd man who seems to have some ideas to help her. As the two look into the estate, coincidence after coincidence piles up until Oedipa finds herself enmeshed in what may or may not be a global conspiracy where almost every person, place and thing she meets up with can, given enough time, be plausibly fit.<br />The central question to this story, does the conspiracy exist or is Oedipa making it all up, is a metaphor which Pynchon pursues over many divergent paths, each leading to a different idea. On one level, Oedipa's quest is a microcosm of each of our own lives: using the available information she (an we) creates a story about the way things really are and continually tests and refines it. That Oedipa finds substantial clues in the oddest and most coincidental places is part of the mystery: is it really that life is so capricious that random encounters can have profound impacts, or is life much more banal, leaving Oedipa to simply imagine connections amidst a sea of information?<br />On another level, Pynchon uses Opedipa's quest to get at the concept of entropy. Pynchon likes to apply terms and ideas from the realm of physics to psychological and sociological phenomena, and his invocation of entropy may be the most famous instance of this. Just as in a closed system individual particles will tend toward greater disorder so in Pynchon's universe do the people and information in our society tend toward entropy. Fighting against this decay is Oedipa, who tries to create some order out of the randomness that she encounters. Again we are met with a similar question, do Oedipa's actions counter entropy and point toward some transcendent truth or is she simply fighting an impossible battle and unable to create order in the world?<br />Once you've accepted that these questions are valid there's nothing to do but follow Pynchon's ideas to their inevitable conclusion: in \\"Lot 49\\" there is no truth other than that which we create. In a sense, all of the characters are like Oedipa; although they aren't questing to ferret out a conspiracy, they are attempting to fit everything they come across into some kind of rational framework. And so do we. Cause and effect only exists insofar as we pick out one certain moment to be the cause and once certain moment to be the effect (even though we could have picked out any two points on the chain of causation), things only become important once we say they are. Each of us is at the center of our own self-ordered universe.<br />But how do we know that the universe is really ours? Every day we are bombarded by thousands of stimuli outside of our control, each of which seeks to order our life for us. Does Oedipa see the conspiracy as she wants to or as the system wants her to? It is here, where Pynchon examines the limits of freedom in modern life that he makes his most substantial points.<br />Clearly, despite \\"Lot 49\\"s brevity, there is a lot at stake, and in its own way this fact makes the book appealing. Lacking the heft of Pynchon's tomes (notably V. and Gravity's Rainbow) \\"Lot 49\\" is pure, distilled Pynchon. This means that if you read \\"Lot 49\\" you don't exactly get the Pynchon experience, but you also don't have to wade through miles and miles of intricate, yet beautiful, prose to see what Pynchon is trying to say. As such, think of \\"Lot 49\\" as an introduction. If you like what you see, then acquire another Pynchon book and read on. If you don't like it, then perhaps Pynchon isn't your flavor.
B000067JG3|5.0|This movie was fantabulous!! Great songs, great actors, and great everything!<br />It's a real life story, it really happened. It is about a woman named Maria(Julia Andrews) and she is a not-so good novice nun in the Abbey. The Reverend Mother then sends her to Salzburg since a motherless Von Trap family needed a governess to take care of its seven children. (wow!) The Captain(Christopher Plummer) is very strict and it's up to Maria to brighten the family up. It ends with the family in danger from the Nazi as they flee from Austria. The songs are magnificent and I love the \\"Do Re Mi\\" and the main song \\"Sound of Music\\".<br />The Austrian scenery is very beautiful and I'm really sure anybody would enjoy this film!
B00003CXXM|3.0|The movie was good. The book was better. If you have read the book, the movie will seem completely different. Don't adjust your set, i *think* this is what they were going for. The movie left out some very important characters like Carlos, Andre' Villers, as well as the staff at Les Classiques, in fact that entire part of the plot. I suppose the book was proably too long to make into a movie exactly the same, but this is unacceptable. For gods sake, they don't even mention conklin's name during the entire film, only in the credits! I am sure, at least i hope that other fans of the book will agree that the movie and book were completly different entities. I will give the movie three stars, and the book five.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Every song on this cd is good. It is better then the bends. However, there are no songs on here equal to creep or fake plastic trees. There are other great songs though, Let Down, Paranoid Android, Airbag, Karma Police, Subterannean Homesick Alien etc. They're all good. If you dont want to buy this cd cause you never heard them download Fake Plastic Trees and then buy this.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is my favorite band ever, I have seen them live twice. In my mind, nobody will ever top them, they are just awesome. This album is proof of that. From the lightning fast double bass on \\"Angel of Death\\" courtesy of metal drum god Dave Lombardo(who is easily among my top 5 drummers ever), to the unforgettable opening riff to the thrash classic \\"Raining Blood\\", this album kicks your [maximus] the whole way through. This is their defining album. Even coming out at a time when such classics as \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Peace Sells\\", and \\"Among the Living\\" were released, this still owns them all. You simply can't call yourself a metal fan if you don't own it, it's a law. This is was slipknot wish they could be, but they will never come close, they aren't worthy to lick the sweat from Slayer's collective nutsacks.
6304539258|5.0|It's what?  Going on 30 years since \\"A New Hope' was released to massive success (and even again in 1997)?  You bet, and it still looks fresh and feels right.  The film has an attitude to it.  A little arrogant and a little sarcastic, but still thrilling and and made the foundation for almost every action and fantasy movie to follow.  Only the recent release of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy has had near that much impact (which I consider this generation's Star Wars).<br />George Lucas was at his creative peak in the \\"Hope,\\"  and it shows.  The special effects are used to help paint the world in which the characters live.  They don't distract and they don't  take away from the actors' performances.  The trench run with the Death Star can still live today with modern special effects laden scenes.  And the actors are so convincing in their roles, unlike some in the prequels.  Alec Gunniess leads the cast with his Shakesperian wisdom, and the cool Harrison Ford is just , well, cool.  Also Mark Hamill is great, as is Carrie Fischer as princess Leia.  And who can forget Chewie?  Star Wars still delivers, watch and enjoy.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Why'd ya do it Rage? I know you do have Zach anymore, but your fans would have rather you put out an instrumental album than collaborate with Chris. Granted, his voice works well with Soundgarden and even his solo stuff is all right. But this collaboration feel strangely mismatched. It's like getting Paul Simon to sing with Slipknot, the combo doesn't work. We appriciate the effort, but I'm going to have to say &quot;no thanks.&quot;
B00003CXXM|4.0|Matt Damon plays a CIA agent who loses his memory.  Through the few clues that he can piece together, he begins the quest to find out who he is, and he's not too pleased at what he finds out.  By his side is a German woman who helps him escape imminent danger by giving him a ride to Paris.  This is a fast-paced, exciting movie that keeps the viewer's attention.  My main objections lie with the casting of All-American boy Matt Damon as a cold-blooded killer and the fact that without knowledge of the book, it's difficult to follow the CIA wheels within wheels.  Still, it's an entertaining movie.
0066214122|4.0|Simply put, Michael Crichton has composed a modern age, technological thriller that will keep you turning the pages. I personally read it in two days flat.<br />The plot centers around &quot;nanotechnology&quot; and Xymos, a company that has created a mechanical swarm that can evolve and survive on it's own. Julia Forman, a vice president of the company, has been acting very strangely and working long hours. Unemployed, stay-at-home husband Jack suspects Julia is having an affair with her co-worker, Ricky. As one of the original writers of the code that Xymos uses, Jack is quickly hired and sent to investigate what went wrong, although he will find more than just an affair going on...<br />I thought the book was totally gripping, it kept you immersed in the story and wouldn't let you go. If you are into technology, science, or simply want a good read, I recommend this book.<br />I do have a few complaints about it. At times, Crichton gets sidetracked and goes into explanations (through the main character) about nanotechnology. In addition, I didn't really like how the ending turned out, I thought it could have been done a better way, and it left me feeling like parts of the story weren't resolved (I won't give it away for those of you who have yet to read it). In any event, it certainly deserves a look.
0780020685|5.0|Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well nearly 50 years later.<br />Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters, mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.<br />Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Speilberg, who make it look easy... who so obviously \\"get it\\". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his finest moments.<br />The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of inhabitants of a villiage specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume <br />The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.<br />Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave, righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless I'm mis-reading him wildly.<br />I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the 21st century? The answer is a definite \\"Yes!\\". Seven Samurai shows us what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and marketing is the new god
0684843749|5.0|This book is the best bodybuilding book I have purchased. It offers the most informative information on the sport of bodybuilding. Everything you need to know, whether it be routines, diets, etc., you will find it in this one of a kind book. Buy it and you won't be disappointed!
B00000AFGM|5.0|as Antichrist superstar was a huge step from the horror-shlock debut album,mechanical animals  is a very huge step from the second album...and in a good way...yeah,its more comercial,but dont forget that this is Manson...and gives the impression that he done it again...this cd is the most artistical material he has ever done.....and songs like,Great big white world,mechanical animals,disassociative,etc...proove that..
B000002UJQ|5.0|A transcendent piece.  Other radiohead albums offer a lot to the listener, be it illogically catchy tunes, smashing rock riffs, or wildly successful experiments.  This album is a little beyond all that.  Some of the songs come together in unexpected ways.  The complexity of the music is the reason it requires multiple plays before appreciation.  The songs just don't make logical sense at first.  But the consistent mood, the imaginative and yet oppressively powerful lyrics are what will make you love this piece.  <br />The lead singer's voice is like a weapon against pop culture in most songs.  Virtually incoherent until you read the lyrics.  Yet used in a way not often seen.  To me it seems like the voice truly is another instrument in the song, and conveying words is secondary.  Yet it yields that much more emotion when you understand the lyrics.
B000067CPX|4.0|I am totally impressed with this album!  I was a little concerned about buying it after Californication came out.  But this album is quality. Almost every song from start to finish could be released.  It was definitely not just thrown together.  The best song by far is number 7.  That one alone is worth the price of the CD!  You definitely need to get this album.
B00004XONN|5.0|That is the best analogy I can come up with.  The music could be categorized as electronica, but that's hardly a fitting summary.  It feels like they are trying to filter ideas, lyrics, and music through the tool of electronica and seeing what happens.  Sort of a late night experiment of sound using well-formed and fleshed out lyrics and ideas as support material.<br />If you, like me, picture electronica as late night rave music and college ... experimentation, don't worry that this is more of the same.  There are sharp melodies here.  Deeply affecting lyrics.  Songs that appreciate over time.  And imagery that won't sit still in your mind.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Hmm, what can I say about t.A.T.u. that hasn't already been said?  Well, first off, don't listen to the new commercials for their album; their name is pronounced \\"tattoo,\\" not T-A-T-U.  I really don't know why they started doing that.  Anyway, let me explain how I discovered them.  I heard about t.A.T.u. a while ago, and their whole marketing act made me remember (with disgust) the time of the Spice Girls.  But they still caught my interest.  One day while I was in Wal-Mart, I came across their single for \\"All The Things She Said.\\"  They were selling it for less than (...), so I figured why not and bought it.  However, I never actually listened to it.  Finally a day came when I was bored and saw it sitting their, so I decided to give it a spin.  For the following week I listened to it non-stop everyday.  Cut to the present, where I have now owned their full length album since Christmas, so I feel I can write a fair enough review of it.   Basically, if you like \\"All The Things She Said,\\" you'll probably like the whole album.  At only 11 tracks (two of which being Russian versions of \\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\"), the album's a bit short, but it's got a low price,and it has behind-the-scenes video stuff and a music video for \\"All The Things She Said,\\" so it makes up for its small tracklist.  Musically, the album is a relatively equal mix of techno, pop and hard rock.  The lyrics are all based around the theme of love, but they definitely don't sound like normal love songs!  As far as their whole image goes, you might as well just not worry about it, because if they do get popular here and last, I can promise you they will lose their whole sexy schoolgirl lesbian theme soon enough.  The good thing is that the music easily trandscends the image, and you forget about their image while listening.  If you watch the bonus material you might notice that they seem to have an image-interest with anime, which doesn't matter much but would be cool if they embraced that idea.  To sum it all up, t.A.T.u. is definitely not for everyone.  Their music might appeal to you if you like techno, pop or rock, but definitely check out a couple of their songs first.  But you should definitely at least give them a chance.  So go on, give 'em a shot...you might be surprised!
B00005B4GU|4.0|There's just something about this album that doesn't work as well for me.  I adore a few of the songs, but many simply seem a little off to me.  This is, of course, in comparison to their previous 2 albums.  In comparison to the rest of the field, it's still among the better albums out there.<br />The lyrics in some of these songs are exquisite and endearing.  Many evoke still images or fantastic scenes in my mind.  Often times the accompanying music adds to this imagery.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I felt that there were times when the music distracted or diverged from the lyrics and mood.  Such as with Knives Out.  A fun piece, but lacking the usual oompf.  But do not be mistaken, there are at least a few songs on here that truly define excellence.
B000002LVB|5.0|Fourth and last studio album of the Velvet Underground. This one is not as much provocative as the previous studio albums, and therefore is seen as more commercial. But that doesn't mean worse in any way. It's still enthralling enough. Some of the songs have become classics which reappear in a variety of versions in the live work of Lou Reed, especially Sweet Jane&quot;, Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and New Age&quot;, which are also the ones that I like the most.
B00005B36H|5.0|Though musically and perhaps lyrically nothing alike, Tool to me represents the same qualities that Radiohead does... a perfect blend of mastery of musical sound with deeply affecting lyrics.  Tool's music feels less experimental, though, if perhaps lest bold and complex.  Harsher, angrier, more despair-riddled.<br />Tool's music is often the work of artistry.  The rhythms are complex yet never overwhelmingly so.  The melodies are harsh yet very evident.  They never seem to take the easy route of simple chords and uninteresting music.  It's nothing like the stereotypical screaming and incoherent guitar thrashing you would expect.  Don't get me wrong, it gets downright loud in places, but never simply to be loud.  Always in service of some melody or musical expression.<br />Schism was my first love on this album, but over countless listenings, I can confidently say that Disposition and Reflection are true masterpieces.  Both might sound experimental at first, but over time seem more like transcendent.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Warner Bros. has outdone themselves to bring one of the finest classics in their library to DVD. This transfer of MILDRED PIERCE is so perfect, so sharp, clear & glistening, it's almost like watching a different film. Gone are the spots and glitches.<BR>The image is smooth and gorgeous, lusciously capturing Ernest Haller's masterful cinematography. The sound is amazing too, for a film of this vintage.<br />The film itself is Joan Crawford's finest hour, and one of the best film noir ever turned out by Hollywood. It's virtues are legendary by now, and I need not recount them here. This is simply a must have for even a casual film buff. A stylish and intelligent drama which is a testament to the dozens of talents that brought it to the screen.<br />If a phenomenal transfer if an essetial classic wasn't enough, Warners has given us a B side with a feature length documentary entitled JOAN CRAWFORD: THE ULTIMATE MOVIE STAR. This is an excellent program that was made for the Turner Classic Movies channel a few months ago, and makes its home video debut here. With an astounding array of interesting interviews, rare film clips, and sumptuous photographs, the show takes the gloves off and presents both sides of the Crawford persona. Her incredible drive for stardom and perfection, her unique place in the hollywood pantheon, as well as the damage her reptutation has suffered due to the revelations made by her daughter Christina who is one of the many interviewed to recount stories about the real Joan Crawford. Others who knew Crawford wisely counter the daughter's words, with their own perceptions, leaving the viewer the opportunity to judge for themselves what they think of Joan Crawford. A very well-researched and entertaining film indeed.<br />Now, they're not done... Warners has also included 9 trailers, including all of Joan's WB films made from MILDRED through THIS WOMAN IS DANGEROUS in 1952. This special feature alone is worth the price of the disc.<br />It's really afield day for the film buff to get an amazingly restored DVD of one of the greatest films of hollywood's heyday, a superb feature documentary, and a host of other extras, for a list price of $20. My hat's off to the great folks at Warner Bros. home video.

B000002U82|5.0|I Don't need to ramble on, but this album tells a deep story. I have listened, made love (perfect for that), heard a deep story, and tried to figure why this band made one album out of 10 songs that most bands could have made 5 albums and 50 songs from. It's a testament to genius, who didn't know that genius existed. These guys give you so many movements in one album that a lesser group would have made several albums out of. I'm 48 years old and I have listened to DARK SIDE OF THE MOON each and every day for the last 30 years. And each time I listen to it, I never fail to hear something new. I'm not stuck in time........the album is.<BR>     Absolutely the most finest work I have ever heard. Problem is, I can't get it back from my kids now. I will gladly buy another (and a spare) so I won't ever be without it. I have asked that this piece be played at my funeral in it's entirety. That's how strongly I feel about this music and it's meaning. I figure if my friends don't get it (understand) now, they will think about it then. Do yourself a favor-buy or borrow it.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence.
0446530573|3.0|These are NOT Sopranos' recipes. For true Sopranos fans the book is just a marketing ploy. The recipes sound very good but the only connection with the Sopranos is that they are for Italian food, (and there are some cutesy pie \\"quotes\\" from Sopranos characters). Carm's famous Lasagna recipe, \\"with fresh basil leaves under the cheese\\" as Uncle Junior tells Bobby when he tells her about the lasagna that Janice \\"made\\" but was really passing off as her own, isn't even included or attributed to her. How hard would that have been? Buy it for the recipes, if they look good to you, not for the Sopranos connection.
B00003CXSP|2.0|The omission of character development (Hannibal, the Verger family, Starling) and changes in story line were extremely disappointing.  Audio CD was much more of a psychostory.  The movie stepped down several notches to a grizzly scary story.  The visuals were excellent and appropriately dark, Anthony Hopkins reflected the best of his dark side. This was not even close to the story Harris wrote. Hollywood is taking some extreme artistic license in the translation. A disappointment.
0312117337|5.0|I own several decks of tarots, but this one is amazing. Although I am not fond of the illustrations (especially when compared with the amazing Voyager Tarot by James Wanless),it really helps one to understand personal issues and how to deal with them. Of course, it also helps to know about Zen as well as Osho's teachings to fully grasp the message contained in each card. The journey offered through this deck is insightful, powerful and brings knowledge about hidden aspects of our tricky minds. I enjoy having this deck help me on the path of enlightment!
B000002JS6|5.0|The success of Back In Black was a real anomoly in the music industry. When a band loses its lead member, it usually guarantees the destruction of the band, or at least its gradual fading into obscurity.<br /><br />When AC/DC lost vocalist Bon Scott to heavy drinking, few would've figured that the Australian hard rockers were going to come back at anywhere near their original power. But then the brothers Angus teamed up with new singer (er, screamer) Brian Johnson, and released the hard rock masterpiece Back In Black. Not only was it a tribute to their fallen leader, it announced their status as rock giants. To this day, Back In Black remains one of the best-selling albums of all time with over 20 million copies sold.<br /><br />This is traditional AC/DC--in other words 3-chord, simplistic, raw, raunchy, anthemic and about as subtle as a ballpeen hammer to the temple. And I love it! This album rocks hard, with barroom standards such as Have A Drink On Me, You Shook Me All Night Long, the title track, and Rock 'N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution. My favorite on this album is probably the ominous Hells Bells, though everything else is at a similarly high standard.<br /><br />AC/DC have never made an album like this since. If you're new to AC/DC, buy this first. Then go after Bon Scott's albums--TNT, Let There Be Rock, Powerage, and the perennial classic of 1979  Highway To Hell.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car.

B00003CXXM|4.0|Matt Damon...need I say much more?  In all honesty, my sister is the big Matt Damon fan...I went because face it...he's not hard to watch...plus I had seen the previews with that awesome car chase scene.  Granted, I'm sure it's not a amazingly awesome car scene compared to others (as I was told by my brother), but as far as this movie goer goes...it was great.  Overall a good plot line, it was definitly funny to see Damon's character over analyze a few things when the girl he's with can get it done a lot faster just by asking.  Definitly worth watching.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton engages the readers mind, satisfying both their technological curiousity as well as their appetite for a good thriller. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet
0767836286|4.0|This movie wins because it is a taut thriller that simultaneously respects the viewer's intelligence and, at its core, has something significant to say about society. <BR> <BR>For the first 20 minutes of the film, I was preparing myself for disappointment, as many of the plot points and bits of conversation are anticipated rather easily.  Fortunately, the film shakes this problem as it progresses, and some of the twists taken by the plot later on more than make up for any early hints of predictability. <BR> <BR>Certainly the best feature of the film is that it combines psychological thrills with dark-alley style suspense, so that as you try to puzzle together what's really going on, you're biting your nails at the same time.  Another great thing is that the film never loses focus of the individual characters, in that many scenes serve to flesh out their personalities rather than just mechanically pushing the plot along. <BR> <BR>There are still some imperfections, however.  For one thing, we're never given quite enough doubt about the main character's sanity.  Many of the people around him seem to question it, and we never have any trouble understanding why, yet at the same time we've always seen just enough more than they have to know that he's really onto something, that paranoia alone won't explain the conclusions he's reaching.  It really would have been nice had this been left more ambiguous for most of the film. <BR> <BR>Also, while I don't at all take issue with the movie ending the way it does, I don't like the fact that in order for the ending to work we're supposed to believe that the protagonist was being played for most of the story.  Given the coincidences upon which major points in the plot turn, this just feels totally implausible by the end.  I think this was the thing I found most unsatisfying about the movie overall. <BR> <BR>In any case, if you're interested in an effective thriller with healthy doses of mystery, action and suspense, &quot;Arlington Road&quot; is a film that's worth two hours of your time.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've been a Cash fan since I was a child back in the early '60s. The honesty and integrity he has always tried to bring to his music is something reserved for only the greatest minstrels and troubadors, and Johnny Cash is one of them! Like Ray Charles he's always had the ability to make any song sound as if it was his alone. Being the stylist he's been since 1955 it's not surprising. Now, as he's entered the twilight of a spectacular life and historic career, there's something unsettling about the songs performed here (Has any rendition of Danny Boy ever sounded more sadly honest?) If Mr. Cash never decides to ever record another album for the rest of his life this one will serve his fans well if he decides it's his last. Hopefully it won't as Johnny Cash is a true American musical treasure.
6305807086|5.0|This movie is amazing.  A.  Ma.  Zing.  And I mean that in every single conceivable sense of the word.  It is a marvel to behold, a comedy with an outrageous premise, but told with great poignancy and emotion.  I can't even begin to describe the plot, or really say anything about the story for two reasons: (1) its so rediculously twisted that I wouldn't know where to begin, and (2) most of the fun of watching it for the first time is in not knowing exactly what the hell you're watching.  All the actors do an amazing job, but its not really the acting that stands out here, it's the inginous story.  Never have I seen a movie that is more constantly entertaining from beginnning to end (besides the imminent Catch Me If You Can).  The story starts, and you're happy that its so weird and offbeat.  Then comes the next 20 minutes, and what you thought was weird in the beginning is now Forrest Gump in comparison.  This trend continues throughout the film, the story constantly putting twists upon twists until the end.  And when the end is approaching, you're thinking, &quot;This movie is so great, it can't possibly end right,&quot; but it does.  And, oh man, does it ever.  What else can I say?  Being John Malkovich is one hell of a ride.
B000002V07|4.0|I had trouble with this album when I bought it on a recommendation from an Amazon user, largely because I was put off by the distorted electric guitars of David Roback and Sandoval's near-spoken vocals - and the fact that the album had been seen as too near to punk for my tastes.<br /><br />However, I was impressed by the haunting beauty of \\"Fade Into You\\", which was so tuneful even if one cannot see Hope Sandoval as a great singer. The melodic acoustic guitar and faintly audible piano can transport an aware listener after several listens.<br /><br />The rest of the album, comtrary to what has often been said, was very varied. Often, it had a cinematic rather than musical feel to it, which helped make it anyhting but an easy listen. \\"Bells Ring\\" is a sparse and highly electrified piece that Sandoval's voice made eerily beautiful despite its lack of technical skill. Even this eerie feel, however, cannot save the hard-rocking \\"Wasted\\" from sounding really tuneless, yet \\"She's My Baby\\" managed to sound like a simple folk-rock song even when Roback's shard of feedback became prominent. Here, the dense drumming served to really make the song actually melodic<br /><br />\\"Blue Light\\" and \\"Mary Of Silence\\" were very contrasting in tone with the above-mentioned songs. These two were the most atmospheric pieces on the album, and \\"Blue Light\\" was a gorgeous experience with its atmospheric organ line, being the best song on the album apart from the single. \\"Into Dust\\", in another contrast, was a extremely simple voice-and-guitar only song that showed the despair inherent in Sandoval's vocal style to an effect almost as great.<br /><br />\\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" does require a lot of listens and you might not like it at first, but, for me at least, it has grown on me a good deal.

She knows that he had taken on the particularly hard case of Tom a black man accused of raping a white women.  Scout is confused, she has heard people muttering behind her fathers back and they don't sound supportive of him like they always have before, she wonders why.   <br />This is an excellent book about racism with a basic underlying message of \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\".  This book should not be read to elementary school kids I think because it does deal with some prickly issues.  If you think your kids are mature enough to handle it then knock yourself out, like I said it does preach a valuable life lesson.

Colin Firth is such a cutie and Jennifer Ehle does really well playing Elizabeth Bennet!

If you're just getting in to Nirvana and want to buy one of their cd's... get Nervermind or In Utero. They are a lot better than this. If you want it, get your friend to burn it for you or download it off  ... Don't waste your money on this.

B000055ZB8|5.0|Count Orlock appears in silence, long of nail, sharp of tooth, pale of flesh, bald of head. Creeping forward, ghoulishly menacing, eyes shimmering in the darkness, plagueing his victims with fear & dread. There is no escaping the morbid spell of the nosferatu.........<br />The wraith-like, captivating phantom played convincingly by Max Schreck, haunts one's visions & rememberance as probably the most horrific incarnation of vampiric evil the world has ever seen. A remake by the same name in Year VII A.S., & Stephen King's Salem's Lot, resurrected the eerie spechtre to re-terrify the world of the living.<br />The original 1922 version of NOSFERATU scared people out of their skins. In that time of puritanical virginity, those who dared to sit in a darkened theatre to witness this first of vampiric movies {up until then, there were only plays}, were in for a scare they were not prepared for.<br />NOSFERATU is based upon Bram Stoker's characterization of Dracula, but a few names have been modified here & there, which gave it a bit more of an original feel. The looming figure of Orlock still brings chills to the unprepared.<br />This is a good one to rent for vampire enthusiasts & archivists, who can still appreciate a horror classic. For those jaded, & seeking a new thrill, concentrate on how it must have been like to live in that era, when motion pictures were relatively new, & your life had been sheltered up to the point of walking into the theatre this night. The lights grow dim, let the horror start.........

Things aren't all well, as eight months ago, a schoolgirl's head was found, and others have vanished since.<br />Jennifer's not your ordinary girl.  For one thing, she has a great rapport with insects.  She loves them and they feel comfortable around her.  A retired instructor and entomologist, Dr. John McGregor, who befriends her, tells her that it's \\"normal for insects to be slightly telepathic\\"--hence their attraction to her.  But is it normal for her, she asks?  In one instance, her presence calms the insects in his lab.  She's also a somnabulist in times of stress and change.  In fact it is one of these nighttime walks that leads her to the doctor.<br />Her roommate Sophie then vanishes, and with the help of a firefly, finds a glove that might have been worn by the killer.  McGregor, convinced that the killer might have kept remains of his victim where he lives, encourages Jennifer to seek him out with the help of the Great Sarcophagus, a fly that can find a corpse from long distances.  \\"You're in a position to do extraordinary things.\\" he tells her, listing her and the fly as \\"the two greatst detective ever known.  That fly is your magic wand.\\"<br />There are some revisits to old themes:  e.g. schoolgirls being murdered (Suspiria), strict headmistresses (Suspiria) decapitations (Deep Red), underwater sequences (Inferno), and attack by animal hordes (again Inferno).  The best effect involves hoardes of flies surrounding one side of the school, coming when Jennifer's in distress.  In a behind the scenes documentary after the movie, special visual effects man Luigi Cozzi explains how they did that shot.<br />There are two music videos using footage both used and not used in the movie.  They are of Goblin's Claudio Simonetti, which features an operatic female voice and a racing techno number.  Another is Bill Wyman, (yes, THAT Bill Wyman) and his stark instrumental number \\"Valley\\" which uses scenes of Jennifer in the mysterious house and the Danish tourist who is killed.  Finally, there's an interview with Argento on the Joe Franklin Show, where despite being touted as someone who out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock, makes the point that his styles are different, which they are.<br />Daria Niccolodi (Miss Bruchner) doesn't have much screen time and isn't as appealing or sympathetic as she was in her previous Argento movies.

B000005DSN|5.0|Visions is definitely one of the greatest power-metal albums EVER. The musicians (Timo Tolkki-guitar, Timo Kotipelto-vocals, Jari Kainulainen-bass, Jens Johansson-Keys (EX-Dio/Yngwie Malmsteen and Jörg Michael-drums (ex-Running Wild) are really great and it can be heard on the album. Hese are some kind of info about the songs:<br />01. &quot;Kiss Of Judas&quot;: as the name tells, the song is telling about that kiss which betrayed Jesus. A good opener.<br />02. &quot;Black Diamond&quot; is one of my favourite songs and one of the best metal songs I know. Its classical intro and powerful chorus are really catchy. The solos are also worth of listening.<br />03. &quot;Forever Free&quot; is a good, fast successor to Black Diamond. The song isn't as catchy as Black Diamond, but it's still a good song.<br />04. &quot;Before The Winter&quot; is a kind of slow ballad. Timo Kotipelto shows his skills singing chorus with really high melodies.<br />05. &quot;Legions&quot; is a fast and catchy one, like Black Diamond -but not as good.<br />06. &quot;The Abyss Of Your Eyes&quot; is a bit slower song between two fast tracks. Fits to the album &quot;theme&quot;.<br />07. &quot;Holy Light&quot; is fast and melodic instrumental, where Tolkki and Johansson are playing really fast.<br />08. &quot;Paradise&quot; is kind of straight rock with -once again- goes with high notes of Kotipelto.<br />09. &quot;Coming Home&quot; is a slow ballad, and this one is better than the fourth track.<br />10. &quot;Visions (Southern Cross)&quot; is a 10 minutes long song which gives a great end to a great album. Some lyrics of the song are Nostradamus' prophecies. The song is filled with some good melodies.<br />This album deserves all five stars, althought the really high speed of the solos is sometimes -especially in Before The Winter- quite annoying. A must for anyone who likes melodic metal.

B000063JDE|4.0|I rarely comment about DVD quality unless there is a glaring issue.  In the case of this DVD, there are several.  The sound track is extremely, extremely important in this film; much of the dialogue is played at near-whisper and the sound effects are much more important to the impact of the film than in most others.  Unfortunately, the sound quality here is just muddy enough to undercut the overall effect.  The visuals are also surprisingly weak, heavy with digital pixilation that is particularly noticeable in the film's shadowy scenes--of which there are a great many.  As for the bonus material, any one purchasing this \\"special edition\\" for them may be disappointed: the documentary is so-so (and I might add that the picture quality there is often flatly atrocious), but the \\"deleted scenes\\" indicated are simply not there.  These scenes have never been recovered, and the DVD offers only a handful of sequences recreated from still photographs and without dialogue of any kind.  Although I am not a great fan of David Lynch per se, I do indeed recognize the importance and influence of both this film and his overall vision, and frankly BLUE VELVET deserves much better than it receives here.<br />All of that said--I saw this film in its first theatrical release, and at the time I did not like it; it struck me as incredibly pretentious and wildly derrivative of numerous European directors, particularly of Hitchcock, Bunuel and Fellini.  (Indeed, I recall remarking to a friend that it was very much like Fellini meets Chuck Waters.)  I had no intention of revisiting the film until a friend expressed an interest in seeing it--and so, rather reluctantly, I agreed to sit through it one more time.  And on this occasion I was pleasantly surprised.  It wears extremely well.<br />That is not to say that there are not problems with the film.  Kyle MacLachlan is a remarkably wooden actor; the plot frequently falls apart; and Lynch's bursts of surrealism are occasionally miscalculated and actually tend to get in the way of any coherent statement.  But what BLUE VELVET does well, it does very, very well indeed.  The story is a bit convoluted, but in general it concerns a young man (the eternally wooden MacLachlan) who comes home from university when his father is taken ill.  While walking to the hospital he discovers a severed human ear--and when the police fail to give him information re his discovery his own curiosity leads him into investigation.  His investigations center on beautiful singer Dorothy Vallen (Isabella Rossellini), who is rumored to be involved with local underworld figures--and in the process he becomes directly involved with both Vallen and the dark forces that surround her.<br />David Lynch uses this storyline as the hook on which to hang his dark statements about the nature of sexual awakening, moral choice, and the deadly evil to which we strive to remain oblivious but which nonetheless lurks very close to the surface of otherwise ordinary lives.  And while many aspects of the film can be justly criticized, in this the film is entirely--and unnervingly--successful.  In BLUE VELVET, sex and violence are ruthlessly connected, and both are forever simmering just under the skin.<br />At the time of its release, and even today, BLUE VELVET was extremely, extremely controversial for its nightmarish depiction of sexual attraction and violence--and deservedly so, for the film repeatedly focuses on a horrific sexual humiliation of the mysterious Dorothy Vallen by the predators that surround her; the rape sequence (which is genuinely horrific), her endurance of repeated physical and sexual assault, her sado-masochistic edge that implies a certain complicity in her own abuse are front and center throughout the film and is all deeply disturbing.  Strangely, however, the film contains considerably less nudity and graphic violence than one might expect; much of the effect arises more from the on-going dark, surrealistic visuals and disquieting sound effects than from any one single scene.<br />With the exception of MacLaughlin, the cast is very fine here.  Laura Dern has seldom been so effectively used in any film as she is here, but the real standouts are Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper; Rossellini was a relative newcomer at the time, but she gives an incredible performance, and Hopper virtually re-invented his languishing career in the role of her psychotic tormenter, and Dean Stockwell's against-type cameo was so startling that it drew tremendous critical fanfare.<br />But now we come to the final question.  Do I like the film?  No.  Even though I can now watch it and appreciate it, and although I certainly recognize its importance and influence, and although I grant it status as art, I still do not like BLUE VELVET and I remain dubious about director David Lynch in general.  It seems to me that he lacks the discipline to create a cohesive statement.  But do I recommend it?  Absolutely.  Those who admire Lynch admire him with a passion, and you may be among those.

B000002572|5.0|You can't get much better than this, and Boston never did.  Their debut album was their best and their biggest selling.  Not a bad song anywhere.  You can sing along with any song on this disk, the all are powerfull and up lifting.  And just like Journey, Boston has a voice (Delp) to match the firey guitar of Shcloz.  Listen to it, and you'll see why it sold over 15 million copies.
B0000024JA|5.0|This is a classic CD. You can't go wrong buying any Meth CD but this is the first one! This is where it all begun. There are 2 many stand out tracks, But of couse one of my favourites is \\"Bring The Pain\\". The rest of the CD is dark and full of grimy Wu Tang productions by RZA.<br />Meth flows beautifully on each track.<br />This CD has almost been warned out from me listening to it so much. If you like any rap u shoud love this.<br />Other Meth titles include- Tical 2000 and Blackout with Redman. But if u dont have any of these i sugest u cop this album first!
0446677450|5.0|That is the inability to release old beliefs.Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&quot;RTK teaches adaptability; to see beyond the norm and to open your mind to new beliefs.I also found many of the reviews to contain errors. For example one reviewers states that RTK encourages one to invest in small cap stocks (true) and penny stocks (not true).There is a world of difference between small caps and penny stocks that I don't have time to explain here. T o make it short and simple, Dell and Microsoft were once small caps and as a person who actually read Rich Dad Poor Dad this what I got from RTK--to buy current small cap stocks with huge upside potential not stocks trading from a penny to a quarter that roll up and down in a range and are basically garbage stocks.Also, in reference to the Smart Money (talk about misnomers for a magazine title!), RTK did repeatedly and politely indicate that he did not want to release the name of Rich Dad to protect his confidentality and I applaud him for that. It was only after repeated requests that RTK &quot;Lost his cool&quot; and went into the Harry Potter thing. The other reviewers have it backwards (as usual)Personally, I don't care who Rich Dad really is....but do you have any earthly idea how much this man (Rich Dad) would have to go through from reporters if his identity was released?Bravo RTK and I don't blame you for &quot;losing your cool&quot;.If you have an open mind and not suffering from homeostasis, you will find Rich Dad Poor Dad an enlighteningread.
0790729687|5.0|Arising from the depths of Anne Rice's mind, the vampires have come forth, both elegant &amp; savage, cultured &amp; barbaric. Ms. Rice adds a lot more to vampire legendry than do many of the gothic novels of contemporary times. We are taken back in time with a mind that seems to have actually been there. All the characters are given such life &amp; personality, that the story gives the impression that it could actually be feasble. There is a mysticism here, a deep fascination for the fantasy, that gives it a life all its own.<br />The brilliance of a truly vampiric talent, resurrects the folklore into a way of existance. Many of they who feel they are born too late in this dull age of mass-consumerism. Finally, we elect are experiencing a menagerie of gothic masterpieces remade to please, &amp; inspire one to dig up the original classics from their cobwebbed &amp; dusty shelves of libraries &amp; parlours.<br />The movie is very accurate to the book, the characters dramatically animate on screen, more than enough to delight audiences, impress the fantoms, &amp; even sufficiently please the authoress, &amp; it is quite rare to please an author, unless the production is pretty much identical to the original. The movie was not terribly &quot;hollywood-ized&quot; as some other vamp films were. The book &amp; the genre's integrity is kept intact. The world portrayed therin seems to come alive from within, a part of one's soul projected onto the screen.<br />Tom Cruise makes for an excellent Lestat {who would have known?}, &amp; the others do not dissapoint either. Sure, there really is no substitute for curling up on a dark &amp; stormy night, with candlelight illuminating a good horror novel, but I think it is finally time to intigrate such marvellous movies by the darkness of a black candle's flicker. For many of us, it has already been long as such.<br />Interview With The Vampire is top quality entertainment for vapire lovers. It contains much emotional/situational relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic &amp; enthralling. We, as Gods, will be able to relate a lot of the philosophical aspects spoken in moments of vampiric revelation. Simply put, Interview With The Vampire is fangtastic.nal relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic &amp; enthralling.

B000002H97|5.0|The black album is Metallica's best album. it is also one of the best metal/hard rock albums ever made. it is highly recommended. Some people don't like this CD because it was Metallica's transitional album. They switched from speed metal to more standard metal. Despite its slower, more standard metal songs, it is still a lot harder and faster than most metal today.<br />Enter Sandman 5/5 - starts off acoustic and turns into one of Metallica's best songs. It flows well, has good rhythmic guitar, and great guitar solos. The bass is pretty good as well.<br />Sad but True 5/5 - another of Metallica's best and one of my favorite songs. It has an incredible guitar solo in it. Kid rock stole sad but true's main guitar riff.<br />Holier Than Thou 4.5/5 - not as memorable as enter sandman or sad but true but still a good song. A little harder than some of the tracks no this CD. Has a few good guitar riffs on it.<br />Unforgiven 5/5 - probably Metallica's best known song. Great in every way. Much slower than most Metallica songs, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Better than Unforgiven II.<br />Wherever I May Roam 5/5 - another one of my favorites. Great song. Slow but still heavy. Its about a guy who roams I guess. <br />Don't Tread on Me 4.5/5 - not well known, but a good song. Decent guitar riffs and a good solo. A lot of people don't like this song, but its good trust me.<br />Through the Never 4.5/5 - good song I have know idea what this song is about but it works.<br />Nothing Else Matters 5/5 - not one of my favorites because it is the slowest, softest song Metallica has ever done. It's pretty much a ballad, which is a Metallica first. You'll see more songs like this on load and reload. I have trouble sitting through it, but it is a very good song.<br />Of Wolf and Man 5/5 - another favorite of mine. Great guitar work in this song. Good in every way<br />God That Failed 4.5/5 - good song. A lot of emotion in this song. I don't think it flows as well as a lot of theother songs on this CD, so I didn't give it 5 stars.<br />My Friend of Misery 4.5/5 - it doesn't really stand out in any way. It's a good song, but it isn't as good as the 5 star songs.<br />Struggle Within 5/5 - this song is the perfect closer to this album. It's fast, hard and short. Lars proves he's a good drummer with this song.<br />In the end I give this CD 5 stars because of the number of great songs on it. It has 7, 5 star songs and 5, 4.5 star songs. I think this CD was Metallica's peak.

0800177177|5.0|An absolutely fangtastic rendition of the legendary vampire. This version is far maore entertaining & visually stunning than most of the productions made thusfar, due partly because Coppola kept as close to the original story as cinematically possible. Which is what we are seeing a lot of lately. It is raw in its reality-prone situations, but there still are scenes that are left up to the Imagination as well, which makes it that much more entertaining.<br />Particularly entertaining, are the awe-striking scenes in the beginning, which shows what made Dracula the supernatural creature he has become. Emotional upheaval, rebellion, & empowerment.<br />Here is the classic story about a solitary vampire who falls in love with a beautiful mortal girl, who reminds him of his lost love who met with a tragic & heart-wrenching death. He turns her into one of the undead, & they WOULD have been happy, but meddling self-righteous mortals compelled by sanctimonious perfidity come encroaching along. Such is often the case. These bastards attempting to make a name for themselves by trying to pull down a superior individual, thus hoping to use him or her as a ladder to their ill-gotten recognition. They might steal credit, or be rotten enough to know that somehow they disrupted someone else's peace of mind, albeit temporarily, until they themselves are exterminated. It makes them feel significant. These psychic leaches, pathetic misdirected masochists.<br />This DRACULA is one of the best movies I have had the indulgence to have seen. The costumes are elegant & accurate, thanks to Eiko Ishioka, & the panoramic vistas are breath-taking, & it is very well cast. Vlad Dracul, played by Gary Oldman of Sid & Nancy fame, transforms throughout the picture into a bat-like demon, a werewolf, & even green glowing fog. His humanistic forms vary as well. From a stoic, stately older gentleman, to a younger gentleman visiting London.<br />One thing is for sure, I have never seen Dracula with so much hair! I believe it is more accurate than the mode of appearance potrayed popularly. Indeed, wood-carvings, particularly that infamous portrait of Vlad Tepes, shows the Prince/Count with long hair, which was the mark of nobility in that time. Only peasants had to cut their hair, so it would not get in the way of their common chores. The term \\"long-hair\\" can be looked up in most dictionaries as meaning an intellectual, a nobleman. Such was the case from Mideival times, unto the Reinassance. It really is too bad that those damned hippies had to marr the perception! True Long-Hairs would spit on those peacenick peasants!<br />Satanic Witchery alert! Lucy, a gorgeous redhead, uses her feminine wiles to captivate her suitors, & manipulates them into a frenzy of lust, while pristine Mina {Winona Ryder} looks on in envy.<br />VanHelsing {Anthony Hopkins} is accuratly portrayed as a stuffy, rude, raving madman who gluttonizes at every damned chance he gets.<br />The soundtrack, oh, the soundtrack! Composed by Wojceich Kilar, is just amazing. Satanic to the hilt. Effectively employabl;e for ritual use. You may find yourself being whipped up in the emotional tidal wave, in the rises & falls of this masterpiece. As if taken within Leviathan's whirlpool, surrounding & penetrating.<br />DRACULA is a romantic, dramatic, horror monsterpiece that pleases & excites. After being submerged in this enchanting dark world, this film promises an eventful night with a date, & may leave one in a higher state of mind, reminiscient of the aeshetically-proliferous Victorian Era. Just think, such beautiful surroundings will be available to be experienced in the not-too distant future. Though some of us have already created our own private totalized environments, it would also be pleasing to be part of a whole community of like-minded individuals. Even a whole city, with arcane architecture with modern conveniences.<br />DRACULA is a must-see for all Satanists, Vampires, Werewolves, Ghouls, &the rest of you, whatever you are. Bring the son of the devil into your darkened theatres, & let the nightmarish joy begin!houls, & the rest of you, whatever you are. Bring the son of the devil into your darkened theatres, & let the nightmarish joy begin!
0140001115|3.0|Written after Conan-Doyle's `Final Problem' short story about Holmes' `death' this book takes place before his confrontation with Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Doctor Mortimer from Dartmoor comes to visit Holmes with the story of a beastly hound which has killed Charles Baskerville and will more than likely come after his heir Sir Henry.<br />Holmes promptly sends Watson off to Dartmoor to guard Sir Henry and report back with all developments. This is the point where Holmes disappears for almost half of the book. But he returns near the end to explain the mystery to all involved.<br />While it is better than Conan-Doyle's short stories in terms of a stronger narrative and a larger mystery `Hound of the Baskervilles' still suffers from long, ludicrous and unrealistic monologues and superficial contrivances. As always the story is told from the point of view of Watson. But it simply isn't a unique enough point of view to make the first person narrative worth it. I can honestly say that if the story was told in the 3rd person perspective it would make hardly any difference.<br />I cannot for the life of me work out how this book is sometimes regarded as a horror. Nothing in it scared me at all. The hound doesn't even show up until the end. And even then Conan-Doyle's description doesn't paint a very vivid picture in your head.<br />There just isn't enough intrigue or reason to keep turning the pages. The human and reality-based side of the story comes thru too strongly to allow any sort of fantastical creativity. As a classic it's a disappointment but compared to the short stories it's definitely better than the norm.

B000002G7G|5.0|The recent release of the deluxe edition of VU &amp; Nico (with stereo and mono mixes) tends to reinforce the fact that this is actually the one Velvet album that you might be really be tempted to own two different discs. Of course this has all to do with the fact that the wonderful box set comes with the version of their third album that Lou remixed himself in order to focus on singer and lyrics.  That was the version originally released as lp.<BR>     The disc offered here is the first mix, before Lou changed things, which presents the group as a standard rock band, with guitars and rhythm vying equally for attention with the singer.  Sterling noted that this mix has the same dynamics as a good Rolling Stones' album.  The music, of course, is beyond sublime.    There may be no album ever recorded that has been so influential on subsequent music.  This is the very blueprint for adult rock and roll.<BR>     Personally, I tend to favor Lou's mix.  Just like Dylan, or maybe Leonard Cohen, these songs are truely poetic and deserve particular focus.  And we heard this kind of arrangement before on White Heat/White Light with the Gift and Lady Godiva's Operation, with the instruments churning away in the background during those gruesome little stories.  With far stronger material, this arrangement works brilliantly on the subsequent effort.<BR>     But either way, you can't go wrong here.  This record ranks right up there with Revolver, Blonde on Blonde, Smile, and Axis: Bold as Love.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is an amazingly brutal, fast, heavy, album for Judas Priest. I can hardly belive it is the same band that made the incredible Sad Wings of Destiny. This is one of the finest metal albums ever.<br />1. Painkiller: 5/5 amazingly fast and brutal track, Halford screams at the top of his lungs here. Good solos, insane double bass drum. Outstanding metal<br />2. Hell Patrol: 5/5 I love it when Halford screams THE HELL PATROL!<br />3. All Guns Blazing: 2/5 I never liked this song.<br />4. Leather Rebel: 5/5 This is an awesome Speed metal song.<br />5. Metal Meltdown:3/5 nothing special, okay<br />6. Night Crawler: 5/5 awesome song, great lyrics, creepy part in the middle of the song. About a murderer.<br />7. Between the Hammer & The Anvil: 3/5 okay. nothing great<br />8. Touch of Evil: 3/5 Another okay track<br />9. Battle of Hymn: 3/5 A short little build up to One Shot At Glory<br />10. One Shot at Glory: 100/5: AMAZING TRACK. My favorite on the album. Halfords vocals are outstanding here, awesome solos from Tipton and K.K. Good lyrics, crazy drums and pounding bass. Just a full on brutal metal track. Way to go Priest.<br />If you like thrash/Speed metal you WILL like this album. If you like more straight forward metal I would recommend Screaming For Vengence. If you like Classic Rock, I would recommend Sad Wings of Destiny. Priest is an awesome band!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I found myself dancing to 'I've Got To See You Again' as it played in the music store.  Sold me right then.  I wake up with different tracks running through my mind and I can't start my day without a fix of Norah.  Her versatility is stunning, from 'Cold, Cold Heart' to 'Come Away With Me' and 'Painter Song' and I expect to wear out my CD in short order.
6303014100|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the most historically accurate movie ever made.  The producers made you truly feel as though you were walking up Cemetary Ridge with Pickett's men.<br />The costumes were historically accurate, and the story line historically correct.<br />The producers did a great job of telling the human story of both Northern and Southern soldiers, and the great internal conflicts they all had.  <br />This movie had no flaws and will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.<br />Is worth more than the price of the DVD or Tape.  Happy watching you will get many years of enjoyment from this DVD
B00007H1Y2|5.0|i picked this cd up because it had a groovy cover, and i am very glad that i did. whoa. that's all i can say. it's, like, trippy, jazzy, ethereal space music, man. totally unexpectedly awesome. if you like music, you will like this cd a lot.
B000002JSZ|4.0|Most people have over-looked this great album by AC/DC, but i think that this is one of their best.<BR>Back in Black was the greatest. That was followed by For Those About To Rock, which was a little disappointing considering the fantastic effort for BIB.<BR>Flick of The Switch came next and it is in between BIB & FTATR in terms of quality.<BR>You know straight away how good this album is with the opening track, Rising Power. It sets up the rest of the ablem with its hard guitar, roaring vocals and great drumming.<BR>Without a doubt the best song from this album is Badlands. The song has awsome pounding guitar grooves, a real [tough]song.<BR>Other great tracks include Nervous Shakedown, Guns For Hire, This House Is On Fire & Bedlam In Belgium.<BR>There are NO FILLERS in this album & i dont consider any AC/DC track on any AC/DC album to be fillers.<BR>This is absolute classic AC/DC, a must for any fan.
B00000K3CR|3.0|This comedy with Tom hanks starring started out with alot of flash and bang, but after the first half of the movie, kind of lost it for me.<br />Tom Hanks is of course a fine actor, and the supporting cast including Robert Loggia had alot of fun making this movie, but it truly lost steam near the end.<br />Enjoy some laughs
0312305060|5.0|I won't give a synopsis, as that has been done by several others and will just tell you what I thought. I saw the movie first, really liked it, then read the book.  I don't know, honestly, which I feel is the best.  As the reviews will tell you, this is the sort of book you either love or don't like much.  I found it a wonderful read.  I loved the way Cunninghan did as Woolf did, confined the storyline to one day.  The women characters are beautifully presented.  I feel the book pays homage to Woolf and will bring about much interest in her writing.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Holy crap this is the best special edition of a monty python film.  I got for christmas of 02 and i've already watched it at least 25 times. its the humor that gets me. And it never gets old. The extra features are great.  The lego knights are funny, and i dont see at all how Eric Idle can be serious at all because when they showed him on set he was always crazy.  They showed the sets and seens from the movie of real castles and its cool how you match up the movie and the castle. It shows who plays who and it turns out Michael Palin played 12 or 13 characters.  i highly recomend this.
B00005CDNI|5.0|A lot of ABBA fans dislike &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; because the group went &quot;disco&quot; for this LP, but they didnt go full bore into that music like the Bee Gees did. They just encorporated it into thier sound, just like they did with europop, bubblegum, folk and classic 60's American/British pop.<br />Compared to most disco albums of the era, this CD doesnt sound as dated. And unlike &quot;ABBA - The Album&quot; there arent as many ballads and silly showtunes to slow the pace down. The songwriting is full of hooks, smart lyrics and the rich production still sounds great after 20+ years. <br />ABBA was a huge influence on synth-dance-pop of the 80's and this CD shows the reason why. I just wish the awesome &quot;Summer Night City&quot; had been issued as a single in the USA back in 1979 - why wasnt it? It would have been a monster hit here.
0446677450|5.0|I thought this was the best book i have ever read.  I feel this book is for only the very open minded that really really want to become RICH.  Not credit card in debt rich but rich.  I dont think this book is for everyone only the poeple the poeple that really understand life and how poeple and socity really work.  People work for money.  This book tells that and how poeple that are rich let money work them.  If you dont understand the last two sentences then dont but this book if you do understand the sentences then you MUST buy this book.

B00005JLWL|5.0|It's not very often that I come out of a movie theater with a big grin on my face and goosebumps all over my skin.  To put it quite bluntly, Equilibrium was that kind of movie.  My all-time favorite books of all time are Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit, and seeing the trailer to this movie immediately reminded me of The Matrix and Minority Report, two other great movies that brings fond memories.  But seeing Equilibrium did more than remind me of all those great novels and movies combined.  It paid homage to those great stories that successfully brought it to the widescreen as opposed to just rehasing a familiar plot.  To achieve such a feat is quite amazing.  Mind you, this is not a mindless action flick at all.  Equilibrium had a plot that was both refreshing and entertaining in the veins of its dystopian predecessors, and the fact that there were moments in the movie where my jaw would drop to the ground while saying to my friends, \\"Oh my gawd, did you just see that?!?!\\" is simply classic.  Definitely a testament to great movie entertainment.
0790742780|5.0|the movie itself is 5 stars, but I give the DVD 4 stars because I wish it had contained some speacial features. Anyway, this is a great film that you should see if you sometimes get to sick of the everday world. If you cant stand the road rage, rude people, rude customer service then you can relate to this film. This film is about us all; all *BLEEP* we take from the outside world and the stress of our sometimes crumbling personal lives can catch up to us. If you ever feel like your going to snap then this film is a great release and yet delivers an important message about why we need to stay grounded and play the game till its over. Sometimes there isnt anything worth playing for, but sometimes there is and we forget...<br /><br />if you like Micheal Douglas, I reccommend \\"war of the roses\\", \\"a perfect murder\\", \\"the game\\" and \\"fatal attraction\\"
B000075BFK|4.0|\\"Better Dayz\\" is arguably the best posthumous 2Pac release since the Makaveli album. Whereas previous posthumous releases, despite their moments, have been cluttered with shotty, banal production far from the quality of \\"All Eyez on Me\\" and \\"Me Against the World,\\" \\"Better Dayz\\" is much more consistent and probably closer to 2Pac's artistic vision.<br />Like \\"Me Against the World,\\" \\"Better Dayz\\" illustrates 2Pac's diverse character, from the  brash, angry, confident thug of \\"Still Ballin\\", \\"When We Ride on Our Enemies\\", ...to the pensive, cautiously optimistic, socially conscious and sensitive figure of \\"Thugz Mansion\\", \\"My Block\\", and and \\"Mama's Just a Little Girl.\\"<br />Those 2Pac fans drawn to the thugged out 2Pac of \\"All Eyez on Me\\" and \\"Hit Em Up\\" will enjoy ...and \\"Still Ballin\\"(ft. Trick Daddy) while those more inclined to hits such as \\"Changes\\" and \\"Dear Mama\\" will be pleased with \\"My Block\\" and \\"Thugz Mansion.\\" Those looking for some tunes to kick back and relax are in luck with songs such as \\"Late Night\\" and \\"Who Do U Believe In.\\"<br />In comparison to \\"Until the End of Time\\", \\"Still I Rise\\", and \\"R U Still Down\\", there are far fewer weak moments in this album. Many of the songs on \\"Better Dayz\\" are close to the same quality as those released prior to his passing.<br />This is one of 2Pac's better albums, yet for the casual 2Pac fan I would recommend purchasing his 1)\\"Greatest Hits\\", 2)\\"All Eyez on Me\\", 3)\\"Me Against the World\\", or 4)\\"Makaveli-Don Killuminati: 7 Day Theory\\" before buying \\"Better Dayz.\\" For the avid 2Pac fan who already owns these essentials, \\"Better Dayz\\" is a breathe of fresh air following previous releases of less-than-stellar material since his untimely death.
B00004R99L|5.0|I love this film and it will forever be my favorite Disney film. I have always been a total off the wall funny guy who prefers nonsense to the everyday stressed and boring real world. Its amazing the stupid things people get so serious or stressed about in todays world; their job, driving, their relationships, etc, etc...<br /><br />i can relate to Alice and her desire to escape to a wonderland of nonsense, but this movie delivers an important message about how you need a little bit of serious and nonsense. All serious or all nonsense is never tolerable.<br /><br />This DVD is great for children or fans of the story. I am 23 and I still love this movie. The DVD has some great extras including some behind the scenes films of how the movie was made. Its amazing the amount of work that Disney put into his movies and it really shows in his old classics. His animators where far ahead of their time and the fluidity of the cartoons still outrank many of todays cartoons.
B00005NTJM|5.0|This is Jethro Tull at their rawest and bluesiest (and arguably their best).  It is completely different from the much more prog-rock sound that Jethro Tull would later have.  This album features Tull doing Led Zeppelin stuff before Led Zeppellin, and well, much better (and with a flute!).  The original tunes really stand out as originals, unlike the rather cynical Zeppellin idea of ripping off early blues tunes and retitling them, rearranging the verses a little and stripping them down some then calling them their own.  Jethro Tull actually wrote their own blues tunes and riffs, which in my mind makes them much more interesting to listen to.  Ian Anderson proves to be a great and versital singer on this record, sounding at times reminiscent of Paul Butterfield (who stands as my favorite White Blues singer).  Though the whole album is strong, A Song For Jeffrey really is the stand out track.  The tune features lovely interplay with lines being traded off between a flute and harmonica.<br />Overall, this is a fantastic record, and a good one to get into (even if it sounds dramatically different from Jethro Tull's later work like Aqualung.)
B00001MXXH|5.0|This really is a great film directed by the brilliant and<br />underated \\"John Hughes\\" who has been involved with other great films like \\"Uncle Buck\\", \\"Home alone 1&2\\", \\"the great outdoors\\" and \\"the breakfast club\\". Wasnt he also involved with \\"planes trains and automobiles\\"? Yet, they only remember speilberg when it comes to classics...<br /><br /> This movie is so funny the first time you see it. The second time its kinda funny, but no matter how many times you watch it, the movie will entertain you! It has great replay value and you get you'r moneys worth. Also \\"John Hughes\\" gives you his commentary and reveals some interesting things!<br /><br />if you like matthew broderick, I recommend \\"the cable guy\\"
B00005UEAR|3.0|Well, If there is one band in metal I have to pick from 100s that I have been listening to in the past decade, as the best, it ought to be DT.  I&W, Awake, SFAM were albums that deserve more than 10 outa 10.  These were the defining moments of metal.  Coming to 6DOIT, this is their weakest release yet. But weal of DT is 1000 times better than best of most bands.  So its just a relative judgement and not absolute.  This album comes out as hurriedly made, and over-ambitious. The album is at best a hodge podge of sounds with a few melodies thrown here and there and at worst pure intellectual & intrument ....  the lyrics are weak and vague, which is not a regular DT trait at all. <br />I admire John Petruchhi and that admiration is about a decade old.  I personally think he is the best guitarist in the world, because he plays killer melodies and lightning fast leads with the saem poise.  He plays electric and accoustic with the same charm.  but he went berserk in The Great Debate.  His sense of melody slipped and instead we have constant voice-overs which are [maddening] you wanna thrown the disk away.  Its mindlesss.  The song is about clonning and its a little political, hence we keep hearing all sorts of quasi news reports and fake speeches.  This is the worst song DT ever composed.  Dissapear starts off great, ends demanding a little more.  This is not classic DT, man, this is confusion & chaos.<br />Complete disk 2 is a concept song.  Well, if you can call eclectic pieces of music which have nothing to do with one another,concept, yes, its one song.  For me Change of Seasons is one song.  Scenes is a great concept. There is a flow, in lyrics, in time signature, in the mood. But the disc 2 here is a watered concept and music here is not the old DT. no doubt, you will enjoy part of it, but the whole is not as good as some parts. <br />The prodigal talent that this band has is incredible. Each and every single member of this band is a master and has one or more side-projetcs. Liquid Tension Experiment (Excellent), OSI/Office of Strategic Importance (Moore + Portnoy, buy it), Transatlantic (Portnots baby, excellent), LaBries MullMuzzler (V Good), Myugs Explorers Club (Good), Rudess's Speedway BLVD (good) and even X member Dereks Planet X (surprisingly good) are just a few examples. These fine artists have ever more projects/side projetcs than it is easy to track. So I guess the essential/pertinent problem here is, along the way of so many creative juices flowing, lines between each individuals side/solo project and what they are to DT as a member got blurred. And this is what has destroyed 6DOIT. As an album, it might be OK, but THIS IS NOT DT! this is a hodge-podge of all the bands I mentioned above and then some. Its like a motivated effort of runofthemill Magna Carta bands, but this is not DT. I hope DT will realize this and overcome the same in the yet to be released TRAIN OF THOUGHT. I have many hopes on that one, I will pre-order it and I hope its DT, my DT, the DT I grew up with and will grow up with. Well, hopes springs eternal, so maybe they will release a record next that will be as honest and approchable as their previous works are.  I will just hope, because I will always love DT more than any other band.
B000063UR2|3.0|I like fantasy which is why I gave this DVD a spin, but it just fails to stir or keep my interest. Unlike other great fantasy films where you are well introduced into the magical world, this movie just throws you right into it. The goblins are so corny and not scary at all and the story is almost too much of a stereotypical fantasy film.<br />To the credit of this movie, the atmosphere they create is really beautiful. The effects and visuals are far ahead of their time for 1986. When looking back at other popular fantasy/scifi movies like \\"Starwars\\" or \\"neverending story\\", some of the costumes look amateur by todays standards. The same cannot be said for the great costumes and visuals of Legend. This has become my \\"sleep\\" movie in my collection(if your feeling tired at the end of a long day, then pop this in as you doze off).<br /><br />if you like Tom Cruise, I also recommmend \\"far and away\\" and \\"Vanilla Sky\\"
B00006I9HJ|5.0|The reviewer below ('a music fan' from Minneapolis) stole his review, word for word, directly from Picthforkmedia.com... and I'm sure he failed to realized what a poor review he copied and pasted here. The reviewer had planned on hating this album well before he listened to it, as is evident by the pointless reference to their, um, popular song from 1996. The album that their 'kitsch' hit was on (High/Low) was brilliant, if not maybe a bit like many albums released around the same time. The reviewer also thought it lame that they have a song in French on the album, ignoring the fact that Nada Surf is very popular (oops!) in Europe and the album has been out there for 6 months.<br />I think Nada Surf's \\"Let Go\\" to be very worthy of 5 stars. Many thanks are due to Barsuk Records, my favorite label, for putting out this album in America. 'Killian's Red' is haunting and beautiful. 'Inside of Love', despite the simpleness of its chorus, is great. In fact, every song (with the possible exception of 'Fruit Fly') will make you want to listen again and fits well in the album. Congratulations to Nada Surf... I can't wait to see what they do next.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi combines great writing and great storytelling in the epic tradition of classics such as Moby Dick.  I choose that comparison because both novels are accounts of heroic struggles at sea.  But beyond that obvious similarity, the beauty and power of both lie not only in the adventures they describe, but also in the profound messages that each conveys.  Moby Dick is a chilling character study of a man driven by ego and revenge.  Life of Pi is a joyous celebration of love and survival.<br />Having just put down this book, I am hard-pressed to decide which will stay with me longer - the magnificent story itself, or its many profound insights.  Who could resist a story like this?  Pi Patel, son of a zookeeper in India and devout Hindu, Christian, and Muslim (yes, simultaneously, much to the chagrin of his three religious advisors), loses his whole family in a shipwreck and finds himself drifting through the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger.  Basic food chain principles dictate that the number of castaways dwindles quickly to two, and the boy and tiger spend the rest of the novel learning to cohabitate in tight quarters - not to mention avoid starvation and survive the elements.<br />But that's not all, for Yann Martel weaves into this fabulous adventure messages that cut to the core of humanity and its place in the universe.  He explores many themes, but two stand out: the nature of faith and religion, and coexistence of man and beast on earth.  Both are covered elegantly and with great meaning.  Pi's touchingly naive desire to worship god in multiple churches, and his well-reasoned arguments for why this should not be frowned upon, raise (and answer) important questions about human spirituality.  And the interdependence of all living creatures is gracefully explored through the discussions of zoo life, and animal behavior, and most profoundly, through the powerful bonds that develop between man and tiger while at sea.<br />As a closing thought, the one other book that I will compare this to is Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.  Life of Pi is filled with the same kind of magic and mysticism, and in a similar way reveals the beauty inherent in the simple mysteries of life.<br />The Man Booker Prize has made an excellent selection this year.at sea.<br />As a closing thought, the one other book that I will compare this to is Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.

B000063UR2|4.0|Back in 1986,when this film first came out alot of people said it was the worst movie ever made at the time.Which I found funny because I was among the few people who really loved this movie,which is now become a classic film.Directed by Ridley Scott(Alien,Blade Runner)and staring Tom Cruise,Mia Sara and Tim Curry(who is so awesome in anything he's in).It's an unusual fairy tale that of course a child at the age of 5(me at the time of the release of Legend)would fine this movie wondrous and visually stunning.You get everything in this movie,fairies,goblins,unicorns and of course mortals and if you by this DVD,you get two versions of Legend.On the first disc,you'll get the never-before-seen director's cut with a different score done by the great Jerry Goldsmith and on the second disc,you get the version we all know with the Tangerine Dream score.I was so pleased to find out that Universal Studios was going to put Legend out on a ultimate edition DVD which is so worth it.It's a great DVD to add to your collection.
B00005JLWL|4.0|The time - the not too distant future.<br />The place - a police state where the public is kept doped up on drugs and supercops rigidly enforce the law.<br />In this society a police officer, the best of the best, breaks free of the drugs and joins the ever-present resistance movement to destroy the big brother government.<br />Some of the scenes are corny (did he REALLY have to dress in a white fighting suit against the black-suited bad guys?), but the fights involving the \\"gun kata\\" (a cross between tai chi chuan and firearms training) more than make up for it.<br />If movies about police states and supercops turn you on, this is for you!
B000002URV|5.0|There were two things I remember when I first heard this album back in 1990,the song Sadeness,mostly because of the monks chanting and that I loved it alot.MCMXC A.D. is a great album with beauitful music to relax too.Saneness,Mea Culpa,Rivers Of Belief,Principles Of Lust and Knocking On Forbidden Doors are the best songs on the album.New age music never sounded so good.
B00005R8DB|5.0|Thelonius Monk is one of the few musicians to create his own true musical universe, not unlike what Bach did in the 18th century, paving classical music structure in the process. But while Bach's apparent concentration was to maintain a tidy, logical ship, Monk's musical universe consisted of pushing the envelope of the musical consensus to near breaking point on a consistent basis.<BR>Listening to this album, starting with the punishingly beautiful title track (my all-time jazz favorite), you will be challenged with one of the most cerebrally unique in-your-face complex musical statements of all time. Monk was a master juggler of tension, luring you forward, and taking you aback with creative precision. I must have listened to it so many times that I have practically learned every musical nuance of the song (even the improvised solos) and now view it as a classical piece in itself.<BR>The rest of the album follows suit, with \\"Panonnica\\" being another particular standout. Every chord change of that song seems to send you further into the twilight, With Monk's Celeste adding a misty taste.<BR>This album is an absolute cure from the conventional. Whenever I get disillusioned which direction the zeitgeist is heading at any particular moment, This album provides a much-needed change of perspective. I bought Monk's 15-CD Complete Riverside Recordings box set, but this album is still his best. Not really for Celine Dion fans, but may be a solution to that and similar afflictions.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Of course the first movie was easy to follow, only geniuses like me understood it. But this time around, \\"Mission: Impossible 2\\" barely has a storyline and it's pure action. Thankfully John Woo directed this 'she's my girl now fool' picture. Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has a virus that can do harm and is going to sell it at an auction. Good thing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) met up with Nyah (Thandie Newton) to deceive her ex. Did you see the look on Ambrose's face when he watched Nyah put on her dress? That was peevish. What a crazy guy he was. The movie is action packed with the ample Ving Rhames reprising his role and blowing cars up no sweat. Good motorcycle chases and fight scenes. It is possible!
B0000039QA|5.0|This was a great album I think this album, was better than his first album. Anybody will tell you that this album deserve 5 stars in a heartbeat.
B00004W52U|5.0|This album is truly one of my favorites in the punk/ska genre. I think almost every track is amazing and well performed. Buy this CD and be changed; you will be happy you did. Their songs are punky and cathcy and have great rhythms and melodys. I think there is 26 tracks, so this isn't a small album. Some of my favorite tracks are &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;Bombshell&quot;, &quot;Room Without a Window&quot;, and &quot;Sound System.&quot; But all in all this is a wonderful album. Buy it today!
6300247376|3.0|This is a Marvin/Bronson flick that finds the two pitted against each other in the Canadian mountains.  Sort of a lame plot, but it shot okay.  The screenwriter should have been shot rather than some of the characters that \\"bought it\\" in the movie.  Any good?  It's just...okay.
6304196784|4.0|John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline for...being in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called Wanda<br />Curtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her \\"brother\\" Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.<br />A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit. It's actually very funny.<br />Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.<br />Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis (one of my favorite actresses)was excellent in a comedic role. Ofcourse, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.<br />It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.<br />A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.
B000002P5W|5.0|This was a favorite which absolutely had to be upgraded to CD.  I liked it 30 years ago and still find it highly enjoyable.  This release has withstood the test of time.  Along with just about all of Jimi's \\"official\\" releases.  After his death, just about any tripe put on tape by Jimi was released, which, unfortunately diluted the technical/studio quality of what Jimi Hendrix would have allowed out of the studio for pressing.
6304401132|2.0|This is another Disney \\"classic\\" in which almost all sense of the original fairy tale has been removed. In this case, things like rape, adultery, cannibalism and more.  In place of the original story line Disney adds annoying soprano's trilling away, an evil witch that turns into a dragon, and a 16 year slumber party at the good fairies house!?!  To experience the real Sleeping Beauty I suggest reading Giambattista Basile's \\"Sole, Luna, E Talia\\", Charles Perrault's \\"The Sleeping Beauty In The Wood\\", or even the Grimm's \\"Brier Rose\\". Disney destroys real classic fairy tales and controls the minds of your children.
0812550706|5.0|I'm completely and utterly gobsmacked. It's been a long, long time since I've read a book I couldn't put down, even to sleep or to work or to think, and this book is a book like this. It completely engrossed me. I had read more adult Orson Scott Card and it had been good, but this was better than good. It was incredible, frightening, exciting, uplifling, depressing and marvellous. Ender WAS Ender, and nobody else. The ending must have been terrible to write; it ends in the only way it can. This book is brilliant; it makes you want to be a genius and fear being a genius. Pure Genius, from almost beginning to end.
B000002UAX|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great collection of tunes.  Recorded in 1968, The Beatles aka &quot;The White Album&quot; has arguably generated more debate than any other Beatles LP.  This album is also the beginning of a lot of inner turmoil within the group, which might explain some of the dysfunction.  The Beatles had done the India thing, Ringo quit for a few days, and Yoko Ono was hanging out in the studio.<br />The Beatles got away from the studio tricks of Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour era songs, especially with the more organic, acoustic-guitar based tracks they wrote in India.  &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; and &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; are all very beautiful songs.  There are straight ahead rock numbers like &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; with its mock Beach Boys chorus and twisted Russian lyrics.  Paul plays drums on both Prudence and USSR.  Other tunes like &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey&quot; proved the Beatles could still really rock, and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is raw metal.<br />If George Martin had had his way, this would have been a classic single album, but we would have missed quirky tunes like &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot; with Yoko's warbled &quot;but when he looked so fierce&quot; lyric.  Or the multi-style, multi-time signature &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; with some bizarre John Lennon lyrics and not so hidden theme.<br />The best song of this set is George Harrison's &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with its haunting rhythm, world-weary lyrics and Eric Clapton guitar solo.  There's a beautiful, intimate solo acoustic version on Anthology 3 that's not to be missed.<br />Why do I give this only four stars?<br />1.  It's disjointed, like it was thrown together with no sense of dynamic.  &quot;While My Guitar&quot; is sandwiched between &quot;Bungalow Bill&quot; and &quot;Warm Gun.&quot;  Really loud songs are right next to really quiet songs, with no cushion.<br />2.  Paul was pretty self-indulgent at this point, with &quot;Wild Honey Pie,&quot; &quot;Why Don't We Do it in the Road&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie.&quot;  I think Honey Pie has a nice melody, but when Paul sings &quot;I like this kind of music&quot; it's a direct poke at Lennon's disdain for Paul's &quot;granny songs.&quot;<br />3.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The whacky bunch behind Monty Python's Flying Circus got together in 1974 and crafted one of the most absurdly hilarious films ever made with Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Python vets Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin weave together a series of skits involving King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table's search of the Holy Grail; and on the way they encounter an invulnerable Black Knight (&quot;I'll bite your legs off!&quot;), a killer white rabbit, three headed knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, and a castle full of swooning, virginal seductive maidens.  Whether you are a fan of the series or not, you will find this film one of the funniest movies you'll ever see, and it is an essential comedy to anyone and everyone.  The DVD features are more than worth noting as well; the double disc DVD features a laugh out loud commentary by Gilliam and Jones along with Cleese, Idle, and Palin, three karaoke-esque sing alongs, Gilliam's original artwork, fantasticly designed interactive menus based on Gilliam's art, and tons more.  If you own this on video or own the older edition DVD, then you should immediately pick this Special Edition up right away.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I am a huge fan of Elvis Presley and this has all of my favorite songs on. I love the new remix of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; and this CD has it on it. Then on the other CD it has the March 1960 press conference that Elvis did at Graceland. That was a special treat for me considering I was not alive in 1960 to remember it.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is my first Mingus album with him playing and having written the songs and recruited the band. My only other exposure had been to a posthumous &quot;Mingus Big Band&quot; collection of his songs, which was not anywhere near as wonderful as &quot;Ah Um.&quot; Surprisingly, this disc is not driven by his bass. Actually, the horns dominate, and they are great horns. Saxophones are manned by John Handy, Booker Ervin and Shafi Hadi. Trombones are played by Jimmy Knepper and Willie Dennis. Horace Parlan tickles the piano, Dannie Richmond is on the drums, and the great Mingus does his bass work, of course...but not as much as one might expect. My gosh, however, all 12 songs are dense and lively and interesting, including the three bonus tracks. This adds up to 72 minutes of great late '50's jazz by an obvious master. As of this writing, there are 27 other reviews posted. Read them for opinions on individual tracks and details on the soloists. As for me, I say the whole thing is great, and essential to any collection of the musicians of that era. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I think this CD is just great. At first, I didn't really pay attention to John Mayer, but after listening to the CD, I fell in love with it. I don't think he tries to be like Dave Matthews at all. He's genuine, in my perspective. The fact that he writes his own songs just adds to that. His voice is so calming and smooth, and his words are unique.
B00003CXXM|1.0|When I heard that The Bourne Identity was going to be made into a movie (another one, rather), I decided to read the book.  It's been one of my mom's favorites for years.  I very much enjoyed the book, and I wondered how the screenplay would handle the fact that Jason Bourne's existence as that character was largely due to the Vietnam War.  I didn't expect that the movie would be exactly like the book; that never happens, of course.  However, this movie was such a departure from the book that I can't believe it has the same title.  If Jason Bourne's name had been changed, I would never have connected it to the book.  There is a movie called The Long Kiss Goodnight, starring Geena Davis as a spy type with amnesia.  That movie resembles the book more than this one does.  Even without comparing this movie to the book it is \\"loosely\\" based upon, I didn't care for the movie.  In fact, when I watched it for the first time, I fell asleep.  The plot was almost nonexistent.  Sure, there were some good chase scenes, but they do not an interesting movie make.  While I would highly recommend the book, The Bourne Identity, I would advise staying away from the movie.  Talk about identity theft.
6300246787|5.0|My 11 yr old daughter is going to be in a Hello Dolly school play.  After searching around fruitlessly in local stores to find that the movie is out of production and quite rare I came here to get a used copy for my daughter to watch. I had to pay an arm and a leg but after watching it again after over 2 decades I think it was worth every penny. <br />Definitely a trip down memory lane and great to see the young (I think 28 yr old)Barbara Streisand, Walter Matthau and Michael Crawford. I had forgotten how breathtaking some of the scenes were such as the entrance of Dolly into the Harmonia Gardens in that stunning gold dress.  For someone that has seen it before a long time ago and liked, buy it, it is a real feelgood movie.<br />For new viewers, this is a musical done in the old style that was popular 3 decades ago.  It might be hard to get used to it unless you like old musicals.  There is a lot of singing and dancing that nowadays looks a little out of place in a movie.  The movie cost over $20 million to make which was a lot in those days, it is reflected in the quality of the sets and costumes which are absolutely beautiful.
B000002UVZ|3.0|There have been many bands that rank R.E.M. as their primary American musical influence, such as Radiohead and Travis, and this album is one to the reasons why.<BR>Life's Rich Pageant isnt' the strongest or the most important R.E.M. album, but it's one of the most rocking.  Folk punk rock has never sounded so real since Patti Smith's Horses album.<BR>The listener can hear influences of Smith, the Velvet Underground, the Byrds, and maybe, even the Monkees.<BR>The ethereal &quot;Fall on Me&quot; is well documented here with the simple lyrics and the melodic musical composition.  The memories it should bring listening to your local college rock station in the mid 80's. <BR>The album's vocalization and the brillance of Pete Buck's playing compliment each other on extremely well and makes you hunger for their earlier work.<BR>The bands punk roots clearly stands our on &quot;Hyena&quot; and the country rock of is evidently heard on &quot;I Believe&quot;. Get up and dance, don't be ashamed punk rockers!<BR>Of course they save the best song for last, &quot;Superman&quot;.  The song combines Brian Wilson harmonies and the Monkees silliness to deliver a song compared to a comet floating through orbit.<BR>An honest to goodness college rock album.
B000065U1N|2.0|Before you make the regretful mistake of buying this version of Black Hawk Down, wait for the release of the special edition 2- disc set that should be coming out soon. It has a load of extras that this one is missing. My low rating is not for the movie, however. This movie is really good with great action sequences and storyline. I would suggest you see it if you haven't. Just hold your horses and wait a bit longer for the special edition to arrive. It will be worth it in the long run.
B000063DHK|1.0|First of all, Bruce Dickinson completely ruins everything.  His voice is always in the wrong pitch, he is always out of breath, he sounds very shrill, and why does he think that he is an opera singer.  Bruce is not even close to being an opera singer.  Listen to Placido Domingo or Bryn Turfell.  Bruce sounds like a screaming little girl compared to how real men sing.  Hearing him do a fake opera type singing is very harsh on the ears.<br />The second problem, is that Iron Maiden have an awful live mix going on.  The guitars, bass, and drums are a mish mash of sound.  I can hardly tell one from the other clearly.  Yes after many many listens I can tell the difference. But I shouldn't have to listen to a cd a hundred times just to hear some clarity and actual musical harmony.  If you want to hear what a live recording should sound like listen to Black Sabbath live evil, any live scorpions or judas priest cd, and any live Dio cd (he has one coming out in April 2003).  <br />Iron Maiden have some (but not many) very good cds that they cut in the studio. But everything they have recorded live always sounds miserable.  Do not buy this.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Forget all the hype that NME, etc have told you. The Vines, The Hives and The White Stripes have not given rock new life. There is, however, a band that can.<br /> Audioslave.<br /> Unless you've been living under a rock for a while now, you'll know that Audioslave is comprised of ex- Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell and Tom Morello (guitars), Brad Wilk (Drums) and Timmy Commerford (Bass), all formerly of ground-breaking rap/funk/rockers Rage Against The Machine. These four outstanding musicians have delivered one great hard rock album, with elements of classic rock, blues, metal and funk. <br /> The opening blast of \\"Cochise\\" will give you an indication of just how great this album will be, and that Audioslave aren't just a side or temporary project from those involved. These guys are committed, focussed and passionate musicians and this is part of the reason \\"Audioslave\\" gets my vote as Album Of The Year for 2002.<br /> The musicianship evedient here is fantastic, the members seem to be playing better than ever before. The hard-rocking riffing is powerful and really hits the songs home, and the tight as a duck's arse rhythm section is excellent and adds a real punch. These guys know when to really nail a track and there are few better vocalists in rock music today with more gusto and ability than Chris Cornell. His diverse vocal performance is a real highlight of the album, from his dynamic call-to-arms on \\"Cochise\\", the energy of \\"Show Me How To Live\\" and \\"Like A Stone\\", and the more melodic feel of tracks like \\"I Am The Highway\\", all of which are kick-arse, no bs, straight-up rock tracks and really illustrate his talents. \\"Set It Off\\" and \\"Light My Way\\" continue the amazing consistency of the album and I can guarantee those tracks will have your head-banging and your body moving in time, caught up in the intensity of it all. The playing is precise and often exhilirating for the listener. <br /> The album flows almost perfectly, and a great production job fromveteran knob-twiddler Rick Rubin allows all four members to shine without any of them being lost ih the mix. The songwriting is also exceptional, there are no slushy, over-the-top,watered-down songs here. If that's what you like, I suggest you look elsewhere other than the mighty Audioslave. That type of music is non-evident on this very album. <br /> Now the inevitable question- does it sound much like the members' previous bands? Well, singles like \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Like A Stone\\" have a real RATM flavour, minus Zack De La Rocha's rapping, and replaced with Cornell's trademark, bombastic vocal range. \\"I Am The Highway\\", amongst others, sounds a lot like latter-day Soundgarden and are also reminiscient of Cornell's under-rated solo album, \\"Euphoria Morning\\". However, this is not just a revival of past glories, these guys are the real deal. They have al but abandoned the politically-charged nature of RATM, and have incorporated elements into their sound to really give the album a fresher feel.  Overall, the band's sound is more diverse than many fans of their past projects than many would believe, with all four members extending and challenging themselves to make an excellent hard rock album.<br /> Whether you're a fan of RATM/Soundgarden/Chris Cornell, or just love classic hard rock, then become a slave to Cornell and co. You won't regret it whatsoever.
B00007BH3Y|4.0|Repetitious and pretty much the same music over and over, the HOURS is good for a relaxing soak in the bath or a night in bed reading. The beat doesn't change much but it is still soothing.
B0000062GK|5.0|I can't believe this album is almost 5 years old.  I still listen to it all the time.  If there is better music out there than this, please let me know.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I was not an especially big fan of the George Pal film version of \\"The Time Machine,\\" but then I was never that much of a fan of the original H. G. Wells novel.  However, in this 2002 film version of the story I find that the same things I liked in the 1960 film are what I liked this time around as well, and that would be when our young scientist, Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce), gets in his time machine and we see the years pass while he looks on in wonder.  Of course, the 2002 version has the advantage of state of the art CGI effects so this time not only do we get to see flowers, automobiles, and manikins herald the passage of the years, we get to see massive geological changes in the same fashion.  But once we get 800,000 years into the future and our hero discovers the split in human evolution between the Eloi and the Morlocks.  At that point the Wells story is dressed up social commentary on the British class system and the action is fairly melodramatic.  That was the case with the George Pal version and director Simon Wells (great-grandson of H.G. Wells) follows suit.  Of course, now we have anomorphic faces for the Morlocks and the Eloi are more environmentally conscious, but the last act is still little more than a variation on the pulp magazine commonplace of man rescues woman from monsters.<br />The script by John Logan, which references both David Duncan's script along with the Wells novel, adds a personal level to the hero's quest this time around, as Hartdegen begins more interested in going back to the past to right a great wrong rather than head off into the future.  I also liked the reason for the decline of earth's civilization, which we get a quick look at in Hartdegen's brief visit to the year 2037; in fact, if the movie had stopped at that point it probably would have been more interesting.  It also would have had the virtue of not being too predictable, but then how many of the people who watched this movie ever read the novel or saw the original movie?  It is the concept of the time machine that is a staple of science fiction, not the story that spawned the genre.<br />This version of \\"The Time Machine\\" is certainly pretty and the special effects certainly overwhelm the performances; the time machine itself is truly awe-inspiring.  But you have to wonder about any film where the best performance is turned in by Orlando Jones as Vox, the holographic compendium of all human knowledge.  This is actually not a knock; Jones shows what he can do in his second scene and I have to like any riff on science fiction and time travel that includes mentioning Harlan Ellison while throwing in a mock Andrew Lloyd Webber song.  Pearce is supposed to be playing an non-traditional hero-type, which is certainly true, but that just ends up ringing hollow when he is confronted with the violent Morlocks and manages to come out ahead.  Still, there is one timeless happy moment in the film when Alan Young makes the requisite cameo appearance by a member of the 1960 film.  I was not offended by this film, because the George Pal film does not hold a special place in my heart or mind, but neither was I inspired by this film; there has to be more to movies like this than the special effects.  Ironically, if there is anything in this world where people get to go back and fix mistakes it is major motion pictures and if you listen to the commentary track with the director and film editor it is amazing how even months later after the finished project they are still coming up with ideas that would have made it a better flick.ginal movie?

B00004YYDI|5.0|When I first popped in this DVD, I was a little skeptical. I was to afraid to compare it to some of my favorite movies of this genre (Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas), but as I watched this movie, I realized one thing. And that was this was an entertaining movie that anyone (old enough) could watch and be astonished. The movie has a solid, yet simple, plot that kept me watching. Music was excellent. Characters were great (minus Gary Oldman's under-developed character). Not only did this movie keep me on the edge of my seat, Leon's obsession of milk and Mathida's Maddona impression kept me laughing to keep my mood good. I can also tell that the extra 24 minutes did very good, mostly being Mathilda's practice. Overall, this is a wonderful movie with a great ending that no fan of action, drama, mafia, or even anime should miss.
0060930187|4.0|I am a 10th and 11th grade English Language Arts teacher in an urban high school setting.  I purchased a class set of this book for my 11th grade classes and I was surprised by their response to it.<br />I initially read the book in college and I was saddened by the fact that Sylvia Plath did, in fact, commit suicide.  I was informed that the book, although published as fiction, is basicly a transparent account of her own breakdown during her college years.  Having been made aware  that Esther, the main character, is actually a flimsy representation of the author, I found the book to be captivating.  I found myself examining the text closely to learn why she never \\"made it\\" after all.<br />My students were similarly motivated.  Sylvia spent some time in Winthrop, a small town neighboring East Boston, so many of the landmarks were familiar to our class.  This added to the sense of \\"memoir\\" that we felt from the text.<br />Student responses were divided.  Some students related to some of Esther's problems or to Esther herself.  Others found her to be a relentless whiner and high practitioner of melodrama.  Everyone was shocked by the differences found in the pressures of a coming of age story set during the 50's vs the values and pressures placed on students today.<br />At the conclusion of the book I had a guest speaker discuss suicide and depression with my students.  For some of my class the book brought up issues and questions.  I wanted to be sure that my kids saw a more optimistic solution to Esther's problems than Sylvia in fact did.<br />Overall, I was given a thumbs up by my 11th grade... Although many students started to wonder \\"if she is ever going to kill herself... or what?\\" others felt decidedly anxious as the plot progressed.  Many of my students liked Esther a lot and felt saddened by the obstacles that she faced during the course of The Bell Jar.  Student opinion was not necessarily divided by gender.<br />Many students confessed to me that they read ahead and enjoyed it more than \\"regular school books.\\" I intend to teach it again next year.ahead and enjoyed it more than \\"regular school books.\\" I intend to teach it again next year.
0060930187|5.0|This book is amazing.  Plath  includes her personal feelings and emotions.  She draws you into the mind and soul of Esther Greenwood.  Although it is has a dark tone, the novel draws you in.  This book is not for everyone though.  If you like happy and light hearted novels, this is not for you.  This is a great book if you are looking to read something \\"deep.\\"  There are many psychological and social issues that are presented through out the text.  The use of symbolism proves to be effective, as well.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid of the idea of death (heaven knows that there is much about that through out the book).
B000065U1N|5.0|I cannot believe people are saying this movie is racist. I hope they know one of the Americans killed in that battle happend to be African American. And the Task Force Ranger wasn't completely white either. Besides why do people have to say the enemy is &quot;black&quot;, they were just people and by calling the &quot;black&quot; and the americans &quot;white&quot; you are only separating people into groups and saying that they are different because of how they look. Black people fight and have wars too, so do whites, and asians and every one else. One person wrote that they found it rediculous that somali women, men and along with children were al fighting.Maybe that person should actually read about what happend and find out that those kinds of things did happen,and it was a fair accurate representation of what really happend. Also remember the Americans went in to help feed the Somalis and to help them and they just returned our help with violence. Overall I think it is a great movie and tells the story of that day very well.
B000000WCA|5.0|oh my god i love the spice girls. they are like the best group in the world. i miss them so much. i wish they were a group again! they are soo great. i love britney spears but...she has nothing over the spice girls. the spice girls are the real thing. they can sing really good. there beat is good. i like the way they just can cooperate each other when they sing. they are like sisters. they sing so good together. i dont think they understand how much they were liked. i dont like them that much when they are on their own. they just look so lonely. they just need to be together. thats what it is meant to be. together. all. including geri. she is good. i love her voice. their movie was great too. i only have 1 of there cd's. that is spice girls. i cant find there other ones. all the stores have ran out. if you are a spice girl reading..please be a group again. i love you. bye
B000002KGT|4.0|Much has been said and written about this album over the years<BR>but I beleive it is more of a document from a band that has finally stablized more than anything else. Many people have considered this album one of the best of all time. This is the best Fleetwood Mac album in the band's history. The problem is many people remember Stevie Nicks contributions to the band and <BR>forget longtime member Christine McVie's contributions. Christine has a beautiful voice, and the cuts on this LP &quot;Don't Stop and You Make Loving Fun are classics. This album is timeless and essential but check out other Mac albums also and give a listen to Pre-Rumour albums and other Fleetwood Mac lineups such as the Peter Green Mac material from the 60's and the Christine McVie/Bob Wetch Mac Material from the early 70's <BR>(1971-1974) as well as the &quot;Fleetwood Mac album with Buckingham and Nicks from 1975 as well as the post 1977 <BR>Rumours material. You will find every Fleetwood Mac lineup, Spencer/Kirwan, Green,(1968-1969)Kirwan/McVie/Welch (1971-1972)Welch and McVie (1973-1974)Buckingham/Nicks/McVie and Nicks/McVie/Burnette and Burnette/Mason/ Bramlett/McVie (1995) have something to offer.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This has become our most listened to CD. The voice is sweet and rich at the same time, and the vocal style is without peer.  We can't wait for the next release. We love female jazz/caberet vocals and have a decent collection. Nora Jones is at the top of our personal charts.
0151008116|5.0|This is like alice in wonderland and Huckleberry fin with animals and a deeply ever present spiritual undercurrent.  It read like a fairy tale about a boy going down the river with a bunch of animals and you come away from it thinking, pondering, and taking note of the spirituality the abounds in every aspect of our lives.  Another spiritual thought provoking book that I like is called, I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You.  It's not about animals or anything though.  It's just some dudes random thoughts about God.  But it makes you think. I love books that make you think
B000066NW0|5.0|I really like this album- it's one of the best I've heard in awhile. I think most of the songs are introspective and pensive, but at the same time they are happy and catchy which is extremely difficult to do. Creed writes alot of introspective lyrics that are just as good as Avril's, but their music tends to be a bit depressing. She can write lyrics about real life without them being accompanied by depressing or angry music. I think that she is real and just wants to be herself, contrary to what others may believe. Until I see evidence otherwise that she's a phony, I will continue to believe that she's genuine and I think her lyrics and music portray that. Not to mention the fact that she's socially responsible and a good role model for children who need a positive role model today, probably more than ever. Anyway, here's what I think of the tracks:<BR>Losing Grip~ A really good song that I and probably many others can relate to lyrics-wise. The guitars are really awesome, as well.<br />Complicated~ Very catchy and very true. <BR>Sk8r Boi~ Yuck! No thanks, I could do without this one. It's not horrible, but the lyrics are weak, the music is weak, and the overall song is really immature and weak. <BR>I'm With You~ Very pensive, very introspective. I think it's about wanting to get away from everyday problems and finding someone to be with, even if only briefly. I can completely relate to this song- it describes exactly how I've felt many times. Unfortunately, it is being so overplayed to the point where I am almost getting sick of hearing it.<BR>Mobile~ Okay- nothin' spectacular. Slightly better than Sk8r Boi. (Let's face it- ANYTHING'S better than Sk8r Boi!)<BR>Unwanted~ Anger. Frustration. Resentment. Heartbreak. The only angry (and perhaps, a bit depressing) song on the mostly happy album. It is a very good song however, and the guitars are absolutely awesome!<BR>Tomorrow~ MY FAVORITE! IMO, THE ABSOLUTE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! Looking to the future in the hopes that things will improve. I can totally relate. She also dubs her voice to sing simultaneously with her main voice in the background and the resulting effect is beautiful. It's ineffable- you'd have to hear it to know what I'm talking about. A work of art.<BR>Anything but Ordinary~ A happy song. The lyrics are a bit weak, but they are very true to life. Also, very catchy.<BR>Things I'll Never Say~ A very happy song about trying to be perfect when going out with a crush for the first time. Wanting to be loved by that person. She also has some dirty, but at the same time, innocent humor in this song (for instance; \\"I wanna blow you..... away\\"- 'clean dirty humor'- I think that's really cool). Another very catchy tune.<BR>My World~ This is an awesome song- maybe the second best on the album, next to Tomorrow. It's about wanting to be somewhere else, wanting to get away- a song I completely relate to. The music is outstanding and the lyrics are equally as good.<BR>Nobody's Fool~ This, I think is the only \\"punky\\" song on the album- other than that I don't know where people get the idea that she's punk- it's a very light song and much less seriously introspective than the others. A happy, light, and really cool song to listen to.<BR>Too Much to Ask~ I could've done without the \\"weed\\" comment- I think it put a damper on a song that otherwise would have been good, especially to insert that comment so early in the song- it was inappropriate for a song of that nature and incongruous. Not a bad song, but not one of the best.<BR>Naked~ A good song. Good music, good lyrics, but not one of my favorites.<BR>I hope this helps anyone out who's considering buying the album.
B00000DCHE|5.0|The SONGS IN THE ATTIC album released in 1981 did not promote the music Bill had been performing in recent years.  Before the release of THE STRANGER in 1976, Billy had already released 4 albums, all of which had done mediocre or poorly, though the songs on them were first class.  Bill wanted to draw the attention of his fans to his early songs, songs that he held dear to his heart.  At his concerts in the early 80's, he played songs like &quot;Everybody loves you Now&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, to which some fans reacted as if they were hearing new material.  Joel took these live recordings and compilated them into a new live album.  In SONGS IN THE ATTIC, Bill succeded in popularizing his early works that otherwise would have been lost to obscurity.<br />All of the songs on the album have a harder emotional impact live than do their original studio recordings.  When Bill plays these songs live, they acquire new meaning and life then in a polished studio form.  These types of songs, such as &quot;Miami 2017&quot;, &quot;Los Angelenos&quot;, and &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, were meant to be played live before a reacting audience.  The emotional aspect of their performances give the songs a new flavor that the listener finds pleasing.  Bill and his band play the songs first rate.<br />The album begins with an amazing(minus the sax) performance of the intriguing and wonderful &quot;Miami 2017&quot;.  Bill then handles wonderfully &quot;Summer Highland Falls&quot;, and struggles through &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot;.  A harder version of &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; is played.  The nearly forgotten COLD SPRING HARBOR songs, &quot;She's got a Way&quot;, and the bitter &quot;Everybody Loves you Now&quot; are played.  &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot;, in particular, is notable due to the addition of acoustic guitars and a harder, more impactful sound.  Also, &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot; is performed in a small smoky nightclub(as seen in thevideo), which permits close audience interaction.  &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Capitan Jack&quot; are also performed.  The valentine's day song &quot;You're My Home&quot;, is performed, with a particularly more powerful vocal by Billy.  Bill closes out with &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, and &quot;I've loved these days.&quot;<br />Several notable early songs such as &quot;Piano Man&quot;, and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, were not released on this album, since signature versions of these songs had already been released.<br />This is a good album for anyone who wants to easily become familiar with Bill's early works.  This album shows the original Piano Man in all his glory.  I strongly reccomend this album for anyone who takes more than a passing intrest in the history of Billy Joel's carrear.
B00006LLNU|5.0|You buy lots of albums. You like most on first listening. Many of them wear out by the third. This one unlocks itself as only a challenging album can. Think about those magical moments when you &quot;get&quot; an album (Kid A, Yankee HF, etc). You spend the rest of your listening life seeking those special works. This one delivers.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Some notable hits were left out of his first compilation, most notably \\"You're my Home\\", \\"Honesty\\", \\"Miami 2017\\", \\"Sometimes a Fantasy\\", \\"An Innocent Man\\", and \\"Angry Young Man.\\"  However, this compilation contains most of Billy's songs that were of any importance between 1973 and 1985.  Simply put, this is a perfect compilation for anyone looking for an introduction to the works of Billy Joel<br />My favorite songs from VOL 1 are \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Only the Good Die Young\\", and \\"Piano Man\\".  From VOL 2, I favor \\"You May Be Right\\", \\"Its Still Rock and Roll to Me\\", and \\"She's Got a Way\\".<BR>A first time listener will identify about half the songs from previous listenings on the radio.  He or she will hear the music and repeatedly stimulate memory of this music in their brain.  The first time I heard Billy Joel, I played this CD.  I was familiar with song after song presented and soon grew to become his biggest fan in the world.
B00005QXDD|5.0|What more could you ask for from Jack Black and Kyle Gass?  This is one of the funniest albums I have ever, EVER heard!  These two are also very talented guitarists.  Very well played solos.  Some very funny skits on the album.  The funniest being Jack and Rage pulling up through a fast food drive through.  Please go buy this album.  It will have you laughing for days.....no forget that, YEARS!  HILARIOUS!!!
B00000DCHD|3.0|A minor musician sued Joel over the rights to \\"My Life\\".  The musician claimed he had written the title, and Joel settled out of court.  As he worked on and promoted 52nd street, Billy faced a whole host of legal issues.  He also had to fight hostile critics, and often responded by tearing up his bad reviews on stage before a mob of cheering fans.<br />THE STRANGER was a fantastic album, so it would be a daunting task for any musician to deliver a follow up release equal to or better than his previous work.  Billy had to undertake the task and turn out another smash hit release to maintain his popularity.  He came out with 52nd street, an album noted for its Jazzy appeal and catchy tunes.  Though he did not qualitatively beat THE STRANGER, he kept up his huge popularity and boosted his standing in the music industry.<br />52nd STREET begins with the hard rock tune \\"Big Shot\\", one of Bill's live performance favorites.  \\"Honesty\\", an overplayed radio song, came next.  \\"Honesty\\" honestly lacked the range and depth of \\"Just the Way You Are\\", a STRANGER release.  \\"My Life\\", the hugely popular hit, came next, and provided the focus of the album.  \\"Zanzibar is an intresting song.  \\"Stiletto\\" and \\"Half a Mile Away\\" show some of Billy's finest musicianship.  Those two songs show his skillful piano playing.  The rest of the album is decent filler material.<br />52nd STREET is niether his best or worst album.  Indeed as said before it has the unfortunate fate of being cronologically in between THE STRANGER and GLASS HOUSES, Joel's two finest albums. It is overshadowed and sort of left in the dark.  But it still makes good listening, and is one of Joel's better works.
B000002G7E|5.0|The detractors have come out in full force for this album, and I join the reviewers who say those detractors are dead wrong. Comparing the Velvet Underground to Miles Davis and saying the Velvets \\"don't hold up\\", as one reviewer did, is insanity. That's like saying \\"milk\\" doesn't hold up to \\"carrots\\". They are incomparable. Complaining about there not being enough \\"songs\\" here is silly also. Remember that the Velvets weren't shooting for making a Rolling Stones' album here, so don't blame them if they didn't. The closing track \\"Sister Ray\\" is the kind of thing you either get or you don't. If you don't like it, don't shout \\"phonies\\" or \\"critic's pets\\", because the Velvets weren't making the song for you to dance to, or for critics to write about. One of the problems with modern music is that some insist it is only \\"art\\" if you create a symphony, and that anything that isn't orchestrated must therefore be Pop Music. \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is born from New York's gritty drug culture, not the mixing board of a Swedish producer, so expect darkness and dissonance.<br />Whether you like it or not, this album is huge. It seems to stand against all music that ever came before it. It takes rock & roll and reshapes it into something terrible and beautiful, something that the world had not seen before. If it seems harsh and painful, that is because the world can be harsh and painful. If we lived in a land of fluffy bunnies and care-bears, we wouldn't need the Velvet Underground, the Beatles, or Bob Dylan with their touches of blackness.<br />To those considering getting into the band, this is not the best place to start. The band's first album, \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" is a better launching point. If you already have tried other Velvet's albums, and if you can appreciate the screeching viola and tender building sensation on the track \\"Heroin\\" even a third as much as Lou Reed's bitter-sweet vocals, buy this one.

At his concerts in the early 80's, he played songs like &quot;Everybody loves you Now&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, to which some fans reacted as if they were hearing new material.  Joel took these live recordings and compilated them into a new live album.  In SONGS IN THE ATTIC, Bill succeded in popularizing his early works that otherwise would have been lost to obscurity.<br />All of the songs on the album have a harder emotional impact live than do their original studio recordings.  When Bill plays these songs live, they acquire new meaning and life then in a polished studio form.  These types of songs, such as &quot;Miami 2017&quot;, &quot;Los Angelenos&quot;, and &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, were meant to be played live before a reacting audience.  The emotional aspect of their performances give the songs a new flavor that the listener finds pleasing.  Bill and his band play the songs first rate.<br />The album begins with an amazing(minus the sax) performance of the intriguing and wonderful &quot;Miami 2017&quot;.  Bill then handles wonderfully &quot;Summer Highland Falls&quot;, and struggles through &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot;.  A harder version of &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; is played.  The nearly forgotten COLD SPRING HARBOR songs, &quot;She's got a Way&quot;, and the bitter &quot;Everybody Loves you Now&quot; are played.  &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot;, in particular, is notable due to the addition of acoustic guitars and a harder, more impactful sound.  Also, &quot;Everybody loves you now&quot; is performed in a small smoky nightclub(as seen in thevideo), which permits close audience interaction.  &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Capitan Jack&quot; are also performed.  The valentine's day song &quot;You're My Home&quot;, is performed, with a particularly more powerful vocal by Billy.  Bill closes out with &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, and &quot;I've loved these days.&quot;<br />Several notable early songs such as &quot;Piano Man&quot;, and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, were not released on this album, since signature versions of these songs had already been released.<br />This is a good album for anyone who wants to easily become familiar with Bill's early works.  This album shows the original Piano Man in all his glory.  I strongly reccomend this album for anyone who takes more than a passing intrest in the history of Billy Joel's carrear.
0425180638|1.0|I generally like patricia cornwell's writting, but this story was just plain bad.  In this book, she proves she can get gross, a way to avoid a skillful or clever story.  I'll really hesitate before reading anything new she comes out with.
B00000DCH9|3.0|The bar scene at the hotel was an atmosphere of depression.  In the hotel lounge, a man serenaded the drunken guests.  Billy Joel, who had released a flop album one year ago, was hiding out in exile from his former manager due to a contract dispute.<br />His barroom experiences led to his writing of &quot;Piano Man&quot;, an exaggerated account of his job.  He describes his intimate relationships with the people in his title song, John at the Bar, Davy in the navy, etc.  It is a brilliant song that provides the focus for Joel's second album, once he managed to get a new recording contract.<br />The record companies were obliged to send agent Clive Davis to sign Joel after &quot;Capitan Jack&quot;, a dark ballad of urban angst and heroin, was recorded in a live concert and broadcast on underground radio in Philadelphia.  &quot;Capitan Jack&quot; became an underground hit and required the attention of the record companies.  Thus, Joel began to work on new songs for his new album, most notably &quot;Piano Man&quot;<br />PIANO MAN was a more complex and varied album than COLD SPRING HARBOR.  It would meet with moderate success.  &quot;Travellin Prayer&quot; is a good song to lead off the album, with a catchy beat.  &quot;Piano man&quot; is the next song.  &quot;Ain't no Crime&quot; is a weak attempt at gospel.  &quot;You're My Home&quot; was written by Joel for his wife Elizabeth as a Valentine's day present, and is a notable early love song.  &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; is a great early Joel classic, and one of the few that sounds better in the studio as opposed to live.  On the B-Side, &quot;Worst comes to Worst&quot;, another song about a piano player, is overshadowed by &quot;Piano Man&quot; and is really ridiculous filler.  &quot;Stop in Nevada&quot;, &quot;If I only had the words&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere along the line&quot;, are average filler material.  The album closes with the haunting &quot;Capitan Jack&quot;, providing a good finish.<br />Do not buy this album until you have SONGS IN THE ATTIC and GREATIST HITS VOL 1 and VOL 2.  Any songs from this album worth listening to can be found on these albums instead for a better bargain.  As of now, PIANO MAN is really only collector material.
B0000027I6|5.0|It's easy to dismiss Amused to Death as no more than the cynical rantings of the dark and enigmatic Roger Waters, a man once labeled \\"the gloomiest man in rock.\\" Certainly, it's no understatement to say that this album is so dreary it makes \\"The Wall\\" seem like a Jimmy Buffet album in comparison. Nevertheless, there's a wealth of lyrical talent to be found in Amused to Death, a sprawling epic that leaps from the pages of history and neatly summarizes the decline of civilization. Waters exposition begins with World War I, in \\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", and then takes the listener through Vietnam, Tienenmen Square, and all of the trademark details of the twentieth century - cable TV, laser guided bombs, Jessica Hahn, and so forth. He contends that the rise of the entertainment industry and media has destroyed the human spirit, wars have become entertainment, the people have become ignorant and unwilling to feel or care anymore. Take these conclusions or leave them if you prefer, but there's no denying that Waters is a master of words, and Amused to Death is humbling in it's lyrical power. There are moments of musical greatness here, augmented by near-perfect audio quality as only the perfectionist Waters would have it. It's heady stuff to be sure, but Amused to Death is a poignant summation of our times and a provocative, intelligent poem of worldly despair.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is simply an awesome album that deserves the hype they are getting. However as a result of this hype, most people assume that they are overrated. When I first listened to this album, I was slightly dissapointed, and i thought that all of the songs sounded exactly the same. But since I had heard so much about them, and also because something about the album made me want to keep listening, I listened to it more. It quickly grew on me, and now I love it. The comparisons to The Velvet Underground are fair, but i like The Strokes better. This album isn't for you if you dont have patience, but if you do, you will be rewarded.
B000005IRG|5.0|I bought the record way back in 1977.  I was in bands in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  We covered See No Evil and later Tom Verlaine's Breakin In My Heart and Red Leaves.  <br />Television was two different guitarists (after Richard Lloyd joined the group) and one of the best rythym sections in rock.  But I listened to the guitarists.  They almost mechanically constructed these songs but the play off each other was so amazing.  Richard Lloyd's solos would knock me down.  The solos were so good and so lyrical.  His solo on Elevation is my favorite guitar solo ever closely followed by his solos on Aint That Nothing and Days.   Then Tom Verlaine's meandering emotional solos that you had to listen to and stay with. Perhaps it was Tom Verlaine's voice that prevented perhaps the best band from the \\"new wave\\" from making it.  I understood that almost no one bought this album.  However, it profoundly influenced me as well as almost any other musician I knew of those days.  Try it and stay with it.  It will make your life a bit more colorful.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|T.A.T.U. are one of the best selling Russian artists. Their first hit \\"Ya Soshla Suma / I Have Lost My Mind\\" is very cool, especially the Remixes. \\"Malchik Gay / Gay Boy\\" is a catchy song too. T.A.T.U. came out in 2000 with these songs. Finally in 2003, T.A.T.U. have popped into the U.S. music scene.
B00005N5S5|4.0|Ever since the first days of written history Man has been dependant on machines. From a simple grainmill to a world spanning super computer, machines represent the pinaccle of humanitys technical capability. In the last sixty years the process of mechanization has reached such a point that life without PCs, e-mails and cellphones is consideraded impossible. Fiction and even some serious studies have brought up the frightning possibility that someday machines, as they become more advanced and complex will become inteligent and will revolt to anihillate us. Terminator is all about that. When you see the movie at first the story looks simplistic, if not absurd. But James Cameron hited the nail actually. The terryfing scenes of hordes of mechanized killers smashing burned human skulls and bones in their march to wipe mankind out is like a warning about the consequenses of the road were taking. And the Terminator(Schwarzenegger) is the symbol of this future, a machine builded to kill, without hesitation or remorse. And who is Sarah Connor? A humble waitress that will become from one day to the other the hope of humanity. A woman living a regular life that doesnt even know what the future holds for her. The time travel subplot was quite difficult for me to understand but hey, i was seven the first time i saw the movie so give me a slack. And know im holding my breath to T3, ill hope its worth the ticket.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Even though I, a Sixties teenager, never tried drugs, never possessed the least amount of curiosity, and never, never could understand the appeal, the prospect of levelling judgement at those who do, did, and will is not an option in the foreseeable future. Especially after viewing 'Requiem for a Dream'. The one thing about drugs that seems to be a universally recognizable cross-cultural phenomenon, is that when one consumes their drug of choice, one is fairly well guaranteed of a predictable set of feelings. Feelings that are far preferable to those randomly and often cruelly dished up by a drug-free life. For many, many people it is easier and far preferable to die in drug hell than to encounter the seemingly bottomless pit of pain that exists in an everday mainstream life. It is no wonder that the life and death of a drug addicted soul makes better sense when viewed from the perspective of choice as presented in this film. When the character played by Ellen Burstyn defends her choice to stick with the diet pills, she makes a stunning case for that choice. Her son is sickened by what he knows will be the outcome of her consumption of those particular drugs, but he can't present a compelling argument without revealing his own scope of personal aquaintance with pharmaceuticals, etc.<br />What it all boils down to is that by the time you are, in most cases, irretrievably sucked into the biggest lie of all for a life (that drugs will take away your pain and give you all sorts of nicer and often ecstatic feelings) you have a double whammy. You would have to go through withdrawal to get out of the addiction phase and go back to face all of those terrifying feelings that you wanted so desperately to avoid in the first place. The truly sad thing is that the terrifying feelings are a real piece of cake when stacked up against the retribution of the outside world against a drug addict.<br />That is why this film is so important. The director and his top level cast go aboveand beyond the performance level to bring us all the truth about the way that all people, nice ordinary people included, can barter their souls for the worst and most profitable scam ever perpetrated upon the human race.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Besides the pink hair and killer bod, there's a real singer in there with a true personality.  Her vocals are outstanding and her balads (Let Me Let You Know, Stop Falling, and Is It Love...) have a real meaning about love relationships gone bad, what she wants in her ideal guy, and veiws on herself and her surroundings.  Her best up-tempo songs (Hiccup, Most Girls, and definitely Do What You Do, and Spit Personality...) aren't drowned in beat and meaningless lyrics; they disscuss her philosophies on love, life, desiscions, and herself.  Like I said before, besides the spiked, pink hair and killer bod, ther's a real artist in there who's destined to be a star.  This album is a definite must buy!!!
B00005K9LN|5.0|This is album is a timeless classic. This is my favorite Judas Priest album, and I personally consider it their best release. No where else can one find traditional heavy metal of the late 70's/early 80's era that stands out with great superiority. <br />&quot;Rapid Fire&quot; kicks the album off to a roaring start. &quot;Metal Gods&quot; is a slow-paced rocker that has an interesting bridge. &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; is a radio stable, as is &quot;Living After Midnight.&quot; &quot;Grinder&quot; could have used better lyrics, but the guitar work by Downing and Tipton make up for it. Adding to their collection of rock anthems is &quot;United.&quot; Any classic metal fan would love this album. This is classic Priest at its best. A top production.
B00000099Y|5.0|Maynard has one of the gratest voices in rock today and he really shows it in this album. His lyrics are just amazing and the way the music all flows togther is breath taking. GET THIS ALBUM AND EVERY THING THAT HAS TO DO WITH TOOL AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!...fav song-H.
B000075BFK|4.0|The thing that alot of people say is wrong with this album is that Nas is on it. Nas and Tupac settled their dispute before Pac died, and Pac agreed to drop the song that dissed Nas, but because he died, Suge Knight released it anyway. This CD has alot of Mellow songs, MY block(remix),Thugz Mansion, Better Dayz, LIfe i lead, and many more. I dont think this was an proper release since Tupac's Mom has said she didnt want it to be released this early.
B000009QPE|5.0|All right! Slayer rocks like you wish you could. This CD is true metal. This CD is loud, fast, and furious. Just blast this in your car stereo as loud as it goes and let the good times roll. I must warn you, it's not for the faint of heart. It's for people looking for a certain edge in their music. This CD gives you that edge. BUY IT!
0446677450|5.0|Really, I expected far more 1 star reviewers than what I see here. RTK goes against the norm; he tells you that what you have been taught all of your life is wrong; if you want to be rich and happy DON'T go to school; go to full service as opposed to discount brokers; a house is not an asset, it's a liability and he recommends Network Marketing.A couple of glorified tabloids have recently taken cheap shots at RTK with edited versions of interviews with Mr. Kiyosaki. What took so long? A National Enquirer type of website keeps getting recommending here, but not nearly as often as I would have expected. Bring it on BABY!Amway keeps getting mentioned and blasted here as well, probably by the same people that dropped out of Amway 15-20 years ago because it \\"is too saturated\\" only to see Amway go from 1 billion in sales to over 5 billion. I think these guys need to re-evaluate that term \\"saturated\\".People freqently bash the Rich Dad board games. But then what would you expect from people who recommend pc games like Grand Auto Theft which teaches you how to become a pimp and a car thief?Yes--I am surprised that there are so few bashers for RD PD. I expected many more. Perhaps even the bashers are accepting the RD PD lifestyle or have just given up in frustration.Oh by the way, I have recieved numerous inquiries for my MLM business solely due to the negative comments made here at Amazon about RD PD. In a indirect way, you guys are promoting MLM--THANK YOU!!!Perhaps some day, you too will start a MLM business and then fully understandhow it feels to create a business from scratch that provides financial freedom and even more importantly, how to build people who previously thought that a 9-5 job and a college degree was all there was to a career.I also ascribe to the RD PD investing advice as espoused in RD PD, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing, Retire Young Retire Rich and Rich Dads Prophecy. If you tried it, you would enjoy profits too.Untill then,  enjoy your penny stock pumpand dumping and your pc games.
B000002INJ|5.0|After listening to \\"The Triumph of Steel\\" and \\"Battle Hymns,\\" I had a pretty good idea of what Manowar is all about when I bought this CD. Upon hearing those big block V-8s taching up in the opening seconds of \\"Wheels of Fire,\\" I also knew that I would love this CD. This is pure Manowar, once again. \\"Wheels of Fire\\" starts things off with a bang, literally. This track is nicely followed by \\"Kings of Metal,\\" a great Manowar anthem. \\"Heart of Steel\\" is great, I believe wholeheartedly in the message of the chorus. Joey DeMaio's bassplaying virtuosity shines in the fast and furious \\"Sting of the Bumblebee.\\" \\"The Crown and the Ring\\" is a song of almost epic proportions, very majestic and well-done. \\"Kingdom Come\\" reminds me of \\"Here I Go Again\\" by Whitesnake, but that's a good thing. Say what you will about \\"Pleasure Slave,\\" but you have to remember: this IS Manowar. I myself find it to be a great tune. \\"Hail And Kill\\" is a great song, in the same category as \\"Battle Hymn\\" and \\"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee.\\" \\"The Warrior's Prayer\\" shows DeMaio's storytelling skills, if not much else. (It's still a nice piece.) \\"Blood of the Kings\\" closes the CD out with a sense of the four Kings of Metal riding off furiously for the next epic battle. Overall, this is an excellent Manowar CD, one that I'd recommend to all those who are considering checking Manowar out for the first time.
B0000029LG|4.0|In 1995, Michael celebrated almost 20 years as a solo artist with the masterpiece HIStory. A two disc set, one of which is a compilation of 15 of his greatest work since Off The Wall in 1979. All the singles that made him what he is today are included; Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Man In The Mirror, The Way You Make Me Feel and Black Or White. Some great songs, however, were left out that should be considered a crime; Give In To Me, Dirty Diana, and Leave Me Alone. Attempting to top that extraordinary body of work, Michael delivers another 15 newly released tracks on a seperate disc. The result is beyond expectations.<br />The opening track, Scream, marks the first duet between Michael and his sister, Janet. With a pairing this strong comes a song that is even more powerful. Scream is one of the best R&B/Dance numbers ever put on tape. First single off the record marking one of Michael's most celebrated top ten hits. They Don't Care About Us is a high powered revolutionary anthem. Michael gives his most open thoughts on social injustice, police brutality, and racism. This is one of the best Michael Jackson songs I have ever heard. Then comes Stranger In Moscow, a song that tops the previous two tracks by far. An engaging low key R&B song that speaks about loneliness. The track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and the delicate accoustic guitar and what sounds like fingersnaps. Michael's vocals are the best in a long time. The best song on HIStory. This Time Around is Hip Hop featuring a rap by Notorious BIG. Earth Song is about peace on earth; only this time, the earth is the one calling for peace, and not the man in the mirror. Another highlight on HIStory. D.S. is a rock song featuring none other than Slash on guitars. A catchy tune where Michael is going at it with Dom Sheldon (D.S.), who is pretty unknown to me. Money is a fierce attack on the families of the boys who accused him of child molestation. \\"Youwould do anything for money\\", he sings, \\"I'd lie for you, die for you, you would sell my soul to the devil\\" Michael covers the Beatles on the following track, Come Together, adding more frustration and fury to the millions of Beatles fans that Michael can take advantage of the Beatles catalogue the way he pleases. Good cover though. You Are Not Alone, the only US chart topper on HIStory, is written by R Kelly and it is, in Michael's own right, one of Jackson's best songs in the past 10 years. More than 10 listens later, however, you're bound to stop listening to it for the rest of your life! Childhood and Tabloid Junkie are filler tracks. Childhood was featured as the B-side of Scream. It should have been that way in the first place and not end up on the record. Tabloid Junkie, Michael's aggressive attack at the media that's dogging him, also would have sounded good as a B-side. 2 Bad is a hard stomping dance number featuring Shaq O'Neal on rap duty. Another highlight on HIStory. History, the title track, can easily be viewed as the 20th century's anthem. The song features tons of famous sound clips from Martin Luthur King, JFK, Armstrong, Lindbergh, and Michael himself! The song features backing vocals by Boyz 2 Men. Little Susie is a little opera about a girl named Susie who was abused and killed by her foster parents. The album closes with a rather daft rendition of Smile.<br />Overall, HIStory is one of the 90's best albums. An above average record celebrating the man who made the 80's music scene a cool place to be!<br />Recommended<br />B+
B000069HK2|5.0|The first time i heard this cd was when my friend came over and was telling me about this great band called The Used. I didnt think much of it, but i gave him the time to let me listen to one of their songs. When &quot;the taste of ink&quot; was over, i was hooked. This is one of the best cds i own now, and i listen to it every day. Buy this one, its worth every penny.
B000001EC1|4.0|Any collection of Bon Jovi songs is near perfect or perfect, so to have to rate this album really is cheating.  But I do have some criticisms to make. <br />If you are only getting this to complete your collection or to get a lineup of Bon Jovi songs played in a refreshingly different order than you are used to, OR just to make sure you have a reference copy to the three songs that as of now aren't available anywhere else, fine.<br />But if you want to get this 1) because Bon Jovi isn't important enough to purchase their catalog, all they are good for is the hits everyone knows, 2) as an introduction to the band, or 3) you just LOVE that song called \\"Always\\", then: shame on you.<br />Bon Jovi is one of the best bands of the second half of the 20th century, and hopefully more than just that.  To think that your Bon Jovi quota can be fulfilled with a hits cd is depressing.  Come on now!  \\"New Jersey\\" and \\"Keep the Faith\\" are such incredible albums, you will never know how good they really are if you don't own them.  \\"Always\\" is just a ripoff of their waaaay better composition entitled \\"I Want You\\" from their \\"Keep the Faith Album.\\"  It went to #1 and now barely anyone seems to know of the 2X platinum \\"Keep the Faith\\" album.  I could go on but I've made the necessary point.<br />Now to the album itself, rated against the criteria of a solid hits album (equally representative of all major hits, albums up to that point in time, and inclusion of new material).<br />The new tunes are alright, but against the masterpiece they made only 2 years before, their evolution in sound was slightly worrisome, only because they were really soooo good in '92 (thank God with \\"Bounce\\", they're back on track again).  \\"Someday....\\" has grown on me but it was the beginning of the \\"strum songs\\" that would be more and more substituting for creative guitar lick-based output by Richie in the coming years.  \\"Always\\", as previously mentioned, is fine, but it blindly stole people's hearts away after that should have already been done by \\"I Want You.\\"  No disrespect to big fans of that song, it IS good. And I also am very aware that for Bon Jovi to do what they did in a time when the music industry begin selling its soul to the devil can only be considered a miracle.  \\"Prayer '94\\" was a hint to how they would continue to play that song off and on to this day, which is fine given you should always be reworking and experimenting, even if the orignial is best (you can't beat the version on Slippery, I'm sorry).<br />As for the hits: Their first two albums, though not excellent, should have been just slightly more represented.  The BIG problem with the album is the huge disappointment in terms of the missing children: \\"BORN TO BE MY BABY\\" and \\"LIVING IN SIN\\" are nowhere to be found on the American release.  \\"In These Arms\\" really should have been there also.  You can only make a cd so long, but these are huge mistakes.  I know it has to do with the record company making money, but if you gotta go to a doubledisc release, you gotta do it.<br />However, I was very happy to see \\"Blaze of Glory\\" on there, and I wish \\"Ballad of Youth\\" could have been there as well.  The songs that ARE there are flawless, and they all deserve to be there, so although it seems like I'm tearing the album apart, it really is essential to ANY cd collection, and its faults are with the material it lacks, not what is already there.  Now just go get the other albums, will you?
B000002NJS|5.0|The atmospheric harmonies have proven Madonna in regaining back her ever-growing success. With the help of collaborator William Orbit, Madonna has reached into a mature sense of Electronica. The soft vibes and chanting lyrics show the quality of each of the songs included in this album.      <br />I give this album a well deserved five-stars.
B0000399WI|5.0|I have just returned from county jail, where a inmate(friend) told me that I have to see this movie.  I have just finished it, and I believe that this movie should be in everyone's library.  It really shows you a story about life.  I would recomend this movie to anyone- that wants to put a smile on their face.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD!! It is the perfect choice to listen to when you need to unwind. I look forward to her next CD.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Wow i never thought that i would be saying this as an avid Bond fan but this movie is horrid. While none of the official 007 films were truly terrible. A couple of Roger Moore efforts less than spectacular. If i compare this to A view to a kill NSNA makes the latter seem like a great film. Here is what is wrong with the movie.<br />The Plot- There is no plot it is just a remake of Thunderball. Something invloving a couple of nukes. They should have come up with a completely different plot line for this film.<br />The Action-Man was this slow paced i am sorry they talk to much and for what little action there is it is not very exciting at all.<br />The Performances-Sean Connery dusted off his tux for one last time and should have never done so. He is to old and is a little thicker around the waste. Hard to imagine love at first sight. Edward Fox as M, Compared to the Fatherly Bernard Lee, Edward Fox's interpretation is shrill and very irritating. Kim Basinger is stiff and not very alluring looks like she is crying all throughout the movie. probably because she found out that this was not an official bond film. Pamela Salem portrayed Miss Moneypenny, i can't pin point it but there something that i just do not like about this person. Lois Maxwell will always be the only Moneypenny. Kalus Maria Brandaur makes for a very uninteresting Largo. Barbra Carrera as Fatima Blush sutibly attractive but kind of over the top. <br />The Direction- Slow paced and needed to be more action. Irvin Kishner to a huge step back with this because his previous was The Empire Strikes Back. The locations were very mundane and not very exotic. One thing Bond films have been. And finally<BR>The Music-Here is where the movie suffers alot, First no Gun barrel opening sequence and no Pre title sequence, Sleep inducing theme song by lani Hall and Michel Legrands score now this was just one lazy careless score, The music is supposed to fit with what is going on in the film seems so out of place andfrom a different time and last but not least NO Jame Bond Theme you know it is a 007 film because of the classic theme somthing lacking. I just could not watch this film because everything seemed so wrong. This Movie is just an utter disgrace and Sean Connery should hold his head in shame for doing this movie He made 007 and always will be 007 in my book but this is what happens when Money talks. So if you want to see an offcial bond film from the same year watch Octopussy while not Moores best it is a fun film and his alot better than this piece of ... I would love to Give it zero stars but cant
B000000IVC|5.0|the sound is perfect in every detail.better than the 1996 and hdcd remaster on aluminium disc.it was amazing to hear how crisp the sound was.if you dont have it.get it used or new.
B000002IHU|5.0|This is Ratt's best album from the 80's. I had this tape back in the day, but I didn't really appreciate how good it was. I just gave it another listen, along with their other releases. This album is great. The songs here sound a lot like the ones from &quot;Out Of The Cellar&quot;, but just more refined. It's like they knew what they were doing now. Ratt had found their sound and we going to perfect it. This is the result of that. There are no bad songs here. For example, I just made a Ratt 2-disc hits collection and I used eight songs from this album. That was the most from any Ratt album. &quot;You're In Love&quot;, &quot;Never Use Love&quot;, &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, &quot;Give It All&quot;, &quot;Closer To My Heart&quot;, &quot;What You Give Is What You Get&quot;, &amp; &quot;Got Me On The Line&quot; are all excellent tunes. The rest are pretty good, as well. I don't give five stars to CD's that don't deserve it. Trust me......this one does. Buy it.
B0000062GE|5.0|I could write a 1.000 word essay on why this album is probably the best album in existence... but very few people would read it. All i'm going to say is that this album solely caputered me emotionally and mentally... It's a masterpiece... Every song could be a single.. and w/out a doubt, it's better than NIN's downward spiral. Here's a breif summary of the album:<br />1. Darkest Days - Great Intro to this great album.. short and sweet - 8/10<br />2. Everything I Touch - A Good Stabbing Westward song, but is almost forgotten when compared to the rest of the cd - 6.5/10<br />3. How Can I Hold On? - Great Industrial Intro. along with a great chorus to complement it- 9.5/10<br />4. Drugstore - Crazy guitar riffs here... this song is SW showing off their industrial talent.  However, the song lacks a good melodic beat  -6/10<br />5. You Complete Me - This is one of those 'hopeless romantic' songs.  A great emotional song you'll find yourself singing along with after you've heard it only once!  -9.5/10<BR> <BR>6. Save Yourself - Also known as the National Industrial Anthem.  This is what Stabbing Westward is all about.  This is the song that got me into the band.  Shame on the fool who hasn't heard it yet- 10/10<br />7. Haunting Me - This song is definetly one of my favs.  I wonder why it wasn't released as a single??  Oh well, great fast-paced song. 9.75/10<br />8. Torn Apart - I wonder why a few reviews i've read trashed this song?  Without a doubt this is one of the best songs on the album.  This song would defintely pump you up.  - 9.5/10<br />9. Sometimes it Hurts - A very moving and emotional song.  It's hard to rank all these songs in a particular order.. but this song might be in the top 3- 9.75/10<br />10. Drowning - Nice slow song. lots of bass synths. very sad song.  Maybe a little TOO sad for me, but I can see myself listening to it alot if i'm feeling miserable- 8/10<br />11. Desperate Now - 2 sad songs in a row.  This song is hands down the most emotional song on the cd.  Listen to this one if you had a bad day. - 9.5/10<br />12. Goodbye - This song has alot of meaning behind it for chris.  I particularly don't listen to it much since its like the 3rd sad song in a row.  Not as good as the previous 2 though - 7/10<br />13. When I'm Dead - Out of nowhere, we go from the 3 most sad and slow songs on the album, to the most hardcore song on the album.  It has a really good verse and chorus.  Good song overall - 8.5/10<br />14. The Thing I Hate - I remember hearing this on the commercial for the first Bloody Roar video game. A fast, angry song, alot of ppl compare this song to the style of NIN.  Yet another great song - 9/10<br />15. On Your Way Down - I love this song.  Defintely a favorite of mine - 9.75/10<br />16. Waking Up Beside You - Hands down the best song on the cd.  Very moving and capturing.  Download it and hear it for yourself first.  Chris's vocals are riveting and the guitar solo is just something else. - 10/10<br />This is the best album i have ever purchased.  I really wonder why this band was never really pushed by the media or MTV... well, i guess industrial rock was never soemthing MTV wanted to put on TV.  Oh well, this stuff here takes the cake... the best cd i have bought and will EVER buy.<BR>Overall Rating- 10/10
B000002IJO|3.0|No, it's not. While this album is not bad, per se. It's just that Ratt came out with three albums in three years and they all sound very similar. While &quot;Out Of The Cellar&quot; was a great debut, and &quot;Invasion Of Your Privacy&quot; was excellent all-around, this one is so-so. I think they went to the well one too many times. &quot;Dance&quot; is the big hit here. It remains one of their biggest hits to this day. &quot;Slip Of The Lip&quot;, &quot;Body Talk&quot;, &amp; &quot;Looking For Love&quot; are the only songs I really like. The rest is filler. And I hardly ever say that about ANY Ratt album. I might be in the minority, but I wasn't impressed by this album. Stick to the other two 80's Ratt discs. You will be better off.
B000006Z8E|5.0|I would not compare this album to the works of either Premiata Forneria Marconi or Le Orme. While PFM, a great group, is quite different in style, Le Orme's widely praised Felona e Sorona presents nothing extraordinary and the band itself is a pretty mediocre musical enterprise. Darwin is a masterpiece. Brilliant work, it's a step above the BMS's first eponymous album. The structure of the compositions is more complex and some influence of Gentle Giant can be seen in the rhythmical switches and melody turns. L'Evoluzione and La Conquista are certain favorites, but also listen to Cento Mani, Cento Occhi, it's an excellent piece. The balladic 750,000 Anni Fa is beautiful but too simplistic and rather atypical for them. Misere Alla Storia with sinister-sounding Di Giacomo is as close to Italian opera as it could be (in that part only), great track. The last piece, Ed Ora, in barrel-piano style creates atmosphere of last-century Italy as we know it from films. Their musical dexterity really shines throughout the entire album. Darwin and their third album are probably their best efforts.
B000002IGP|4.0|This is the first album I heard from Ratt. And it certainly doesn't disappoint. Ratt was always a band with sleazy lyrics &amp; sound. Along with George Lynch, I think Warren DeMartini was a underrated guitar player. Steven Pearcy was a perfect frontman. He didn't have a really great voice like other lead singers, but it fit Ratt's music very well. This album started the band to stardom. &quot;Round And Round&quot; is the obvious huge hit here. It remains Ratt's signature song to this day. &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, &quot;You're In Trouble&quot;, &quot;Lack Of Communication&quot;, &amp; &quot;Back For More&quot; are the other nice tunes here. One thing I have noticed with Ratt is most of their CD's have little to no filler. A lot of the songs may sound the same, but if you like their sound, then you won't have a problem with most of their tunes. I recommend picking this one up. It's one of their best.
B000000HTM|4.0|than the previous two but not by a huge margin. Lemmings is good, (Hammil must have loved this dark metaphor, tiny suicidal creatures, very much his style). Man-Erg is interesting too (the slow part shows some musical similarity with House With No Door) as well as Lighthouse Keepers. Both the lyrics and music create very dark mood (thus not a recommended listening during the times of stress), it's Hammil's trademark and his forte. Fripp's continuing presence is quite transparent and uneventful though his own later efforts on Lizard and Islands and Lark's are somewhat reminiscent of the dark side of Pawn Hearts.
B0000020C4|4.0|If you became introduced to Les Misrables by way of this recording, then you're probably partial to it.  While I believe that this was a more than fitting tribute to the musical's tenth anniversary, it definitely is not the best of the English recordings.  First of all, this is not an accurate representation of the musical.  There are no occasions when one would see the musical with a chorus of 200 and a huge ensemble cast.  As a result, some of the songs come off feeling overly grandiose.  However, while the orchestra on this recording is actually bigger than the one on the Complete Symphonic Recording, David Charles Abell does a much better job of conducting then I think Martin Koch did.  As for the \\"dream cast\\", yes, they are good.  Colm Wilkinson reprises his role of Jean Valjean, and gives what would under any circumstances be an outstanding performance.  The problem is, his performances on the Broadway and London casts were simply much more powerful and full of emotion.  Philip Quast is unequivocally the standout performer among these actors.  We all got a taste of his medicine before on the Complete Symphonic Recording, and it seems he has only improved upon that performance here.  Find me a better rendition of \\"Javert's Suicide\\"!  Ruthie Henshall is a great Fantine.  Her performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is powerful and heart wrenching.  However, she was better in Chicago.  Hannah Chick is good as Young Cosette, but she doesn't stand up to the likes of Zoe Hart and Donna Vivino from the London and Broadway casts.  Jenny Galloway is the best Mme Thnardier, although some would argue that she made the character too comic.  Alun Armstrong is also the best Thnardier, and his performance here is magical.  I think that he and Jenny Galloway worked perfectly together and blew away the audience in every song.  Adam Searles has a great voice, but he is simply too old to play Gavroche.  The character is supposed to be 9 years old and he was 13 at the time of this performance.  Michael Maguire is, hands down, the best Enjolras ever.  His performance on the Original Broadway Cast is definitely better, although much of his part was cut from that recording.  It is nice to see those parts performed here.  And, of course, Michael Ball-the best Marius around.  His voice was so incredibly powerful on this recording that he must have shattered the eardrums of the entire audience!  Although I am a huge fan of Lea Salonga, especially of her performance in Miss Saigon, I was simply upset to see her here.  Where was Frances Ruffelle?  For someone who won a Tony Award in that role and gave some of the great musical performances of all time, it seems a crime to have left her out.  But, Lea Salonga's performances in \\"On My Own\\" and \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" are beautiful just the same.  I was very happy to see Judy Kuhn back.  She had just ended a successful run in Sunset Boulevard and she sounded great, although she's way too old to be playing Cosette.  Finally, Anthony Crivello gives a phenomenal performance as Grantaire.  He complements the rest of the cast beautifully.  All in all, this is a great recording and a fitting tribute, however, I still think the Original Broadway Cast is worlds better.
B000000HTL|4.0|with their first one. Killer and House With No Door are good songs. The lyrics supplement the music very much, and so does Hammil's singing. Robert Fripp's appearance did not change matters significantly. <BR>The rating is more like 3.8

B000002505|5.0|What happens when you put two of the world's finest guitarists together ? The result is LDS. Recorded in 72/73, Columbia cleverly managed to unite these two giants who were extremly popular at that time. Carlos had Santana &amp; McLaughlin was with Mahavishnu. A unification of their band members Douglas Rauch on bass, Mic Shrieve on Drums from Carlos's band plus Jan, Billy from Mahavishnu along with (late) Larry Young provided the necessary punch that makes this album potent even today. Carlos's style of playing shows Mahavishnu influence &amp; is evident in this album as well as the earlier Caravanserai. The concept of using two guitars works well on this album due to the complex compositions. Unfortunately, this is the only official release from this era. A short live tour in 1973 between John &amp; Carlos has never been released officially &amp; people who have seen that tour swear that they have never ever seen such intense guitar work ! Wake up Columbia....can we have a live release at least in the 21st century ?
B000066NW0|5.0|Ever since I heard the song &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio,I've loved Avril Lavigne's music. I think it's awsome that she's and individual, and co-writes her own songs. Sure, this music isn't exactly &quot;punk&quot; but it's still great. She has a fantastic voice, and I bet she'll be famous for a long time. My favorite songs are &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, &quot;I'm With  You&quot;, &quot;Unwanted&quot;, &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, and &quot;Naked&quot;, but all the songs are great.

I recommend the Workbook format because it is an active approach to self-understanding and improvement.
0060194995|5.0|To Kill A Mocking Bird was one of the best books i have read in a long time.   It tells the story of scout a young girl growing up with her dad and brother.  Her dad is a lawyer currently involved in a huge trial the trial has a lot to do with rasism. I loved it.  I would recomend it to any body.  I especialy like the end when Scout goes and stands on Boo Radley's porch and sees the world through his eyes.  Five stars this was an easy pic.
B00000K19E|5.0|The world we're living in is just a blanket, to hide you from the real world.  You're dreaming, but you've never woke up.  This is the concept of &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  Don't be fooled by the start, this movie gets very good.  This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, up there with &quot;Minority Report&quot;.  The action is great, and the effects are breathtaking.  I would recomend this to anyone who feels like watching a different kind of movie, sci-fi fan or not.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Not a child of the 80s, I bought this album for the &quot;Walk of Life&quot; guitar work, but it was the soulful lyrical images  of &quot;Your Lastest Trick&quot; and the haunting war commentary of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; that got me hooked. For anyone who loves music (and life), this is a MUST HAVE.
B00006M183|4.0|Riot Act Rocks... plain and simple... Song after song of melodic innovative tunes that have become a staple of Pearl Jam's over the past decade or so... Riot act delivers...  One thing I've always admired about the band is their ability to reinvent their sound succesfully each and every time... with so may other bands failing to do so.... (most even) but this album tends to sound a little simillar to Binaural in some aspects.  Not to say it isn't an excellent cd, and well worth the price to any pearl jam fan, and even those who just like a few PJ songs, as this album has many radio worthy selections.  Even bushleager which is basically a politcal rant against George W, set to a chorous, is catchy after a couple listens...<br />Definate recomendation...
0385503954|3.0|I think the writing style in this book is powerful: I was impressed by McEwan's evocation of the different characters' thoughts and interpretations (sometimes misinterpretations) of the same events, and I enjoyed his prose (though I didn't like his occasional laziness, such as when a character states an opinion in the first section of the book, and is given the opposite opinion in the second). The sections of the book that deal with the approach of WWII are particularly resonant to readers in 2003. I also liked the character of Briony, which many Amazon reviewers hated. But the virtues of the writing are ill-supported by a weak foundation of plot. Briony's misunderstanding of the crime she witnesses depends on a complicated and sometimes implausible chain of events and coincidences, and I wasn't convinced that every person involved with the investigation and trial (which are barely mentioned by McEwan) would so easily convert to one point of view. McEwan paints a compelling picture of how a witness can misinterpret what they see, but fails to give equally compelling reasons for the reaction of the crime's victim--her motivations are inadequately explored, to say the least. I also became frustrated with the characters of Robbie and Cecelia: Robbie is supposed to have read Freud, but it never occurs to him that a child might be upset by the sight of two people having sex, and Cecelia never bothers really trying to talk to Briony, or to the victim, which might have helped her discover the truth. Cecelia is also guilty of the crime Briony commits--she repeatedly accuses another innocent person--but she's so consumed with self-righteousness that she never notices the parallel. McEwan's book  could have made a more powerful statement about assumptions of guilt and innocence, but instead he directs a disturbing amount of hatred at a 13-year-old girl. The wronged characters are angrier with her than they are with the person who actually committed the crime. The book muses on the power of authors, and it seems to me that McEwan misused his: he laid a trap for his character, and then punished her for falling into it.

B000006NPY|4.0|You should never judge an album by it's cover, but the dark, washed-out, artsy cover of Adore speaks volumes. Maybe it was the heroin-related sabbatical of Jimmy Chamberlin. Maybe it was the death of Billy Corgan's mother. Maybe it was just a whim. Whatever the case, when the Pumpkins put out the record in mid 1998, they changed their sound around dramatically. Gone were the arena rock anthems, replaced by synthesizer noodling and white noise. Instead of pained wails, there were mumbled introspections. As a follow up to the powerhouse double CD 'Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness,' was an album  of lonely night music, that despite being slagged by many, is perhaps the band's finest moment.<br />If there is one consistency between this record and the Pumpkins others, it's Billy's vocals. His nasal whine could be offputting to some, but there is certainly an attractive quality to it. Sometimes he's a little more agressive and punctuated with it (\\"Ava Adore,\\" \\"Pug\\") whereas sometimes it's a little more on the quiet, melancholy side (\\"For Martha,\\" \\"Annie-Dog\\") but it's all unmistakeable. <br />The lyrics too, are definitely very Corgan. Sometimes confusing musings create vivid picutres of women with perfumed kisses (Daphne Descends), raven hands (The Tale of Dusty & Pistol Pete) and velvet spleens (Annie-Dog). There are car crashes (Tear), break-ups (Perfect), longings (Crestfallen), regrets (Once Upon a Time), unanswered questions (Appels + Oranjes), seductions (Pug) and other such brooding topics, all of which add to the album's dark atmosphere.<br />That atmosphere is compounded by the music itself. Lilting pianos dominate some tracks (\\"Crestfallen,\\" \\"Annie-Dog,\\" the first half of \\"For Martha\\" and especially \\"Blank Page\\"), whereas tracks like \\"Behold the Nightmare\\" and \\"Tear\\" are filled out by guitar strumming and soloing, haunting percussion and peculiar synth additives. \\"Pug\\" and \\"For Martha\\" (the second half) have fantastic electric jangles. \\"Ava Adore\\" has a smashing bass groove over almost techno drumwork. And speaking of electronic influences, tracks like \\"Appels + Oranjes,\\" \\"Perfect\\" and  \\"The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete\\" almost (almost, mind you) cross into that genre entirely.<br />And in true, perhaps pretentious (but who ever said that was a bad thing?), fashion, the album closes with 17 seconds of piano that trails off into nothingness, representing sleep, death, or any of the albums other themes.<br />Of course every record has a few flawed moments. \\"Ava Adore\\" for example, is a little to aggressive to sound right amidst the rest. \\"Shame,\\" though very pretty, is also soporific. And sometimes it's less specific. There are occasional pauses or phrases, though few, that just don't seem to work, however, nothing unforgivable.<br />Maybe it has a few skips, and it certianly doesn't sound like the band we were all used to, but it's still a powerful and poignant effort that leaves little to be desired. Highly reccomended.
B00000J7SS|4.0|I hate discussing music theory in reviews, so if you want detailed examinations of the usage of the diminished Am pedal mixolydian or whatnot, look elsewhere. I may make up some fancy music term though. Just to make me feel special. At any rate, if you haven't at least heard of this one, you probably haven't done much looking into the history of rock or of jazz, as this really is a monumental recording. Miles was one of the first to try and combine modern jazz music (as opposed to older, more traditional jazz like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington and Count Basie and so on) with rock rhythms and instrumentation. Instead of just acoustic pianos and brass and saxes and such, we've got electric piano, electric bass, electric guitar, and all sorts of other neat things on top of Miles and his trumpet, as well as some sax and even a bass clarinet. This is one of the first jazz fusion recordings and the best I've heard, and for that it does certainly garner some respect from me.<br />I first heard this record when I was 12, and by then I was already a huge Coltrane fan and listening to lots of different music. But I initially couldn't get into the sound. It's almost mind-bogglingly odd at first. Honestly, I thought it sounded like a bunch of people got trashed and starting playing instruments in a studio. There was no predictability, no easily recognizable melody or riffs, and certainly no pop hooks. But that has changed some with listening. At first, I really disliked the first two cuts, which together go on for 45 minutes and take up an entire disc. Those are some long compositions, to be sure. Especially when you're convinced that someone had spiked their coffee in a \\"Grace Slick visits the White House\\" manner. Thus, I couldn't even sit through them the first time around. So, I switched to the second disc. Then stuff started to click. Maybe there's just something about the first cut on it that grabbed me. At any rate, it did grab me. Viciously, too. It kicked my 12-year-old butt, threw my poppier CDs out the window, tied me into a chair, and forced me to marvel at its jazzy glory.<br />Not really. However, B!tches Brew is certainly fascinating. I have finally come around to the first disc, and both discs are truly masterpieces. The individual pieces seem to be almost mood landscapes, but very dark ones. The electric pianos give a spacey feel to the music, while the bass clarinet really adds some residual creepiness to the mix. The exotic rhythm gives a taste of Africa or the West Indies. John McLaughlin's awesome guitar playing certainly is an emotional ingredient to the brew, whether it be smooth, jazzy explorations, or more gutsy and raw rock licks. One very interesting aspect is the presence of both acoustic and electric bass at the same time. That gives a real feel of depth to the music, almost like an ocean trench. Then of course, Miles is \\"runnin' the voodoo down\\" on his trumpet. The sound is night-oriented in as much as it has a very after-dark feel to it. I get images of dark beaches on remote islands when I listen to it.<br />Each song really conjures up a mysterious and majestic world of its own. Since there are but a few cuts...you notice I've said cuts instead of songs? That's intentional. To me, song implies a definite, recognizable structure. The musical comparison to a stricter poetic set, like a sonnet. Fairly defined rules, but lots of flexibility on some counts, and unlimited creativity within the frame. This music is very much outside the box. Long, stretched-out grooves that have some planning, but are often very improvisational and moody. So, here are some images that come to mind, both serious and not. Why? Because I'm killing time. On second thought, why break this up cut-by-cut? I'll just throw words at you. Shoehorn, duck, tan, fingernails...oh yeah, these words are supposed to be related to B!tches Brew. Okay, Martha Stewart, Courtney Love, Tipper Gore, George W. Bush...okay, I'll be serious this time. Night, beaches, tropics, primitive life, rhythm, spontaneity, wildness, sinister, unpredictability, encroaching darkness, hot deserts, searing yet cooling....get the picture?<br />Basically, repeated listenings of B!tches Brew really sucked me into another world this album creates like no other. It's beyond stunning and emotionally amazing. It created a whole new genre by combining two existing ones. It's rock, but it's jazz. It's unique. It also influenced me to look into more stuff like it, and since it was my first Miles Davis record, I think it helped introduce me into jazz (along with Geri Allen's The Gathering), since Coltrane was the only jazz I listened to prior to this. However, there is a flaw in all of this unique greatness. IT'S TOO LONG! At least for one sitting. At least an hour and a half's worth of fusion on two discs....ay chihuahua! Also, while certainly unique, it's also somewhat repetitive. Similar rhythms, similar instrumentation, and let's face it, improvisation is by no means limitless. But this is ideal for jazz fans, as it sends you on a far-out trip. Whee!
B00007BK2N|4.0|\\"24 Hour Party People\\" was among the most entertaining motion pictures released in 2002, and easily one of the most engaging and innovative films that I've seen in years. Although certainly not for everyone, if you've an interest in the music industry, the UK indie scene, and/or Factory Records (of course) then this is mandatory viewing material.<br />I'll not bore you with a summary of the plot...but it's no secret that there's almost as much fiction as fact in this comedic, documentary-style account of Tony Wilson and his legendary Factory record label. However, there are numerous exceptional portrayals of the central figures from Factory's sordid history, and the city of Manchester is a star in itself, functioning as the drab backdrop to the movie's colorful story.<br />The DVD has two featurettes - a ten minute 'behind the scenes' piece (obligatory for almost all DVD releases) and a five minute quickie about the real Tony Wilson. Neither contain particularly engrossing content but they're welcome just the same. There are eleven deleted scenes, only a couple of which are really worth a toss (ironically, the cut scene with Vini Reilly that Steve Coogan's Tony Wilson actually references in the film isn't even included). There's a photo gallery with at least 40 stills taken during the film's production, although including pictures of the real people and places depicted in the movie would have made more sense. I've not listened to the running commentary by the real Tony Wilson or his celluloid facsimile, but I understand that both are enlightening. <br />With the exception of the James Bond series, MGM Home Video is notorious for lacking in the special features sections of their DVD releases, so this product is actually commendable on their part. Of course, the UK DVD release of \\"24HPP\\" (complete with a Factory catalog number - FACDVD 424) is a 2-disc set packed with extras vastly superior to what's offered to us poor Yanks. So while I'd give the film five stars, theDVD rates only three, thus my average of four stars overall.

B000002WYT|5.0|Nowadays, The Dave Matthews Band seems to have lost their creative, innovative, original sound somewhat. This makes listening to Crash that much more enjoyable for me. I like to hear the more original sound that this album has as compared to the somewhat stale pop-like sounds off of the last two albums. From the mellow sounds of songs like &quot;Crash&quot; to the great rhythm of &quot;#41&quot;, this album shows the true power of the Dave Matthews Band sound.

B000002LOE|5.0|&quot;Out of Time&quot;, R.E.M.'s commercial breakthrough, proves once and for all that the band, which debuted ten years earlier with their highly original &quot;Murmur&quot;, could excell in pop in terms of both sales and musicianship. This, of course, was never really open to debate; indeed, for all of &quot;Murmur&quot;'s subtleties, it had hooks galore. However, on &quot;Out of Time&quot;, Berry, Buck, Mills and Stipe dive headfirst into the world of accessability, detached from the politicizing and mumbling of yore. And what results is beautiful none the less.<br />The immortal &quot;Loosing My Religion&quot; is perhaps one of the greatest and most important songs of the decade. &quot;Oh no, I've said to much/I haven't said enough&quot; is one of those classic, incredibly true and poingnant lyrics that you just can't help but love. And that subtle mandolin! I just love this song.<br />The rest of the album is great as well. &quot;Low&quot; is one of Michael Stipe's best vocal performances, and it's so uplifting when those strings come in at the climax, a great technique later used in &quot;Drive&quot; on &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. &quot;Belong&quot; is a deeply moving tale in desparation, while &quot;Radio Song&quot; is a throwback, but such a fun throughback is a rarity, and I don't even get annoyed by the rap during the brige. One thing I find interesting is the fact that Kate Pierson, lead singer of the B-52's, guests on two songs of the album. The interesting thing is that the B-52's were the post-punk antithisis of R.E.M. While R.E.M. were singing low, sombre songs about pilgramages and passion, the B-52's sang infectious, happy songs about Rock Lobsters. However, while &quot;Me in Honey&quot; is delicious, &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; is somehow almost too cheerfull. However, that just makes the album itself that much shinier.
B000001ESP|3.0|I know this is Rush's biggest selling album and most popular. So what! At the time of its release, I just thought it was a good followup to Waves. 22 years later, my opinion hasn't changed. All the Rush heads I knew at the time felt the same way. PERMANENT WAVES BLEW US AWAY!! It took a good 2 years to digest Waves and about that time, Signals was released, so I guess I missed all the hoop-la concerning this album. But Pictures CRANKS! Tom Sawyer, as well as Limelight, were both ruined by radio (if you haven't heard either of them, that's ok...one of them will be on the radio within the next 10 minutes). Witch Hunt never did much for me. Camera Eye ranks as one of my big 5 of Rush (along with In the End, Anthem, Xanadu, and Entre Nous). Vital Signs, however, totally turned me off. Nope...don't like it. I have always liked Signals and Grace Under Pressure more than Pictures. Looking back, I still consider Permanent Waves to be Rush's peak...everything following it would be secondary, including Moving Pictures. I guess I missed something. However, it is interesting that only one Rush album has recieved a 5 star average customer review from amazon. And it is NOT Moving Pictures.....it's Permanent Waves. Maybe I didn't miss anything after all.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I wasn't a fan of her old stuff, it was too poppy to tell the truth...<br />But this cd is really good. Dirrty doesnt make it justice. the rest of the tracks are way better. Best tracks: Can't hold us down, Fighter, Cruz, The voice within, Walk away &amp; Impossible<br />if you like britney, don't waste your time with this, christina is already on another level (thank god)
B000001ESN|5.0|This is pure Rush. In every way. This is the standard by which all Rush is judged. This is what I judge all the 'modern' Rush of today by (and the last 20 years). Maybe that is why it is heartbreaking to see (and hear) what has become of them. This is Rush's peak. Everything following Permanent Waves would fall short. Yeah, yeah...Moving Pictures would sell zillions of copies. But looking at it from a musician's point of view (Rush at one time was a musician's band because we understood how difficult and complex their music was), this is their most challenging effort (compared to their childish songwriting of today). Permanent Waves is a portrait of a band with direction. They knew exactly what they were doing, and where they were going. A flawless album. My least favorite track would have to be Science...not because it's a bad song, but because I can't help getting agonizing cramps in my left hand when I (attempt to) play it. Lifeson is a true Guitar God on this album. And it's so much fun to play, even decades after its release. Listening to Peart on this album makes me want to pick up some sticks (and I know NADA about how to play drums). And Geddy's voice is in the period of his life where it was changing between the phases of {{{{{{SCREAMING}}}}}} and, well, what would become later. Also Different Strings would be the last song written by Lee (the remaster credits are flawed...check out the original LP). And it remains the ONLY Rush album to recieve a 5 star average customer review rating from this site.
B000009VOL|5.0|What makes Moon Pix (and Cat Power) so wonderful is that I can feel a connection, I am FORCED to feel a connection with Shawn Marshall and that is afterall the most important goal of art--for one human to be able to connect with another in a way we can't through mere socializing or regular interaction.  <br />If you are of a weak constitution beware of &quot;Colors and the Kids,&quot; it could crush you and leave you an emotional wreck frantically dialing your therapist.  The song invokes tears on every listen.  She somehow captures the beauty and pain of life itself in that song.  Because of the power of this album, it is advised to only listen to it sparingly when the mood is just right; it would be a shame for this to become merely backround music.  I pray I never hear it in a coffee shop.
B000002LQR|5.0|I was lost in the world of music, i needed an album that i could cherish and hand down generation to generation.<br />BSSM was the album for me. The Peppers seem to blend Funk, Rap and Rock so effortlessly. In this album though they came of age. It had rebellion, sadness, anger, politics, sex, spiritual. The list is endless. Kiedis's vocals maybe a bit sketchy technically but he sure does pack a punch when it comes to rapping. Then there was the 21 year old John frusciantes dazzling enthusiasm and pure guitar genius, he was agressive and mellow with beautiful intricate little riffs. Flea was as good ever with strongfunk orientated slap bass. Chad was quality throuhgh out.<br />The album peaks for me on songs like the heart felt tribute to Hille Slovak (ex guitarist)My Lovely Man, the awesome Suck My Kiss, but the album will be remembered for the amaznig ballad Under The Bridge. Kiedis says \\"it was a lttle bit embarassing\\". I think its a little bit amazing. it really is a gem.<br />It is very long and has 17 tracks, nonethless this makes it even better. it is a true classic.<br />           \\"HIt ME U Cant Hurt ME Suck My KISS\\"
B000002U94|5.0|The piano introduction alone, on the song, against the wind would be enough for me to purchase this cd. It is awesome. The rest of the cd is almost as wonderful! Get your check-book or credit card ready, this one is well-worth the money!
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD really blew me away.  I first heard Chop Suey and thought it was the best song in the world.  I listened to it so often, that I eventually got sick of it and SOAD slipped from my mind.  Then I heard Toxicity and loved that, and that one didnt wear out its welcome so I bought the cd and found out that the best songs were still yet to come:<br />Prison Song - A Hard hitting song, with a death metal feel to it.  A great one for sure.  Some might not like it though, since its not like anything else.<BR>Needles - A great song about Drugs...the bridge where Daron starts to sing is really well done<BR>Deer Dance - Great song, very heavy until it gets to a great mellow bridge.<BR>Jet Pilot - Probably near the bottom of the cd in terms of greatness.  But still listenable<BR>X - A very hard song, but its over before you can get into it<BR>Chop Suey - A great song when I first heard it, but now I can still listen to it, but a lot of the other songs are better.<BR>Bouce - A funny song which I laugh when I listen to it<BR>Forrest - Fantastic song, one of the best<BR>ATWA - Its about Charles Manson, but has an incredible opening, one of the best on the disc.<BR>Science - One of my favorites, I just love this song<BR>Shimmy - Along with Jet Pilot, near the bottom but still good.<BR>Toxicity - In the top 3 of favorite songs on this album<BR>Pshyco - a great catchy song with a incredible guitar solo at the end<BR>Aerials - The best song on the album, listen to this song and I ask anyone to not love it
B00000J7J4|4.0|It is not that often where in life you can get a second chance to shine on stage all over again in the music industry. In the case of the late 1990's, it happened to two legendary artists, Cher and Santana. For Santana, the comeback would be a milestone in his entire life. It wasn't that easy to sell at first, with a name like &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, but with a name change to Supernatural, it became a memory worth the wait in gold.<br />The 1999 album, Supernatural features acclaimed duets with some of the biggest acts in the music industry, like Rob Thomas of the group Matchbox 20, Eric Clapton, Everlast, and Dave Matthews. Although the songs are mostly in a foreign tongue, the acclaimed duets like Put Your Lights on with Everlast, Maria Maria, and Smooth, all became a huge part of Pop culture. Nobody could've ever imagined this in a lifetime, not even the &quot;Corporate Pop&quot; industry of acts like Britney Spears and NSYNC.<br />While many people think that is was a desperation act for Supernatural with all the artists teaming up with Santana, it became a real legacy to show off in place. It is just kind of sad that a lot of records can't shine like that in a lifetime. Yes, especially a record that has won 9 Grammys.
6304401736|4.0|This live action version of the Disney 101 Dalmations hit is engaging for tots and adults alike, particulary of course when viewed in a cozy setting, allowing for cuddling and reassurance during a few scary spots.  Glenn Close is the quintessential villainess and does the job A++.  Joely Richardson, Vanessa Redgrave's lovely daughter, and Jeff Daniels as her hubby, are wonderfully fine at representing the young couple with the dalmations, and the puppies.  It has something for everyone, no doubt about that.  The bumbling bad guys are a hoot, the dogs wonderfully engaging, the wintry scenes in the country are truly charming.  Great fun; don't miss it.  Add to you library whether you are 2 or much, much older
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Growing up is difficult, especially for Donnie Darko. Set in Middlesex, New Jersey in October 1988, this film revolves around a pubescent boy who wakes up one night to find himself hearing a voice (belonging to a giant bunny rabbit) which guides him out of his house. Having slept on a golf course he returns the next morning only to discover that a 747 jet engine has crashed directly into his room. He has, in effect cheated death. Donnie realises that he has 28 days 6hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds before something terribly important will happen and the only guide he seems to have is this imaginary friend, the rabbit.<br />Sound like its going to get confusing? Trust me it does, right up until you see the end credits at which point you will no doubt ask yourself what the hell just happened, and find very little in the way of answers. If you do, however manage to work this film out, you will undoubtedly understand why this is the cult film of the year.<br />So what is this film about? Well, that's surprisingly hard to answer; script writer & director Richard Kelly himself has said that it can be pretentious and condescending to an audience to say that his film is about a certain subject. You might say that it was about fear and love, although Donnie would argue that nothing is ever that simple. I think it is about a whole host of things, not least love, time-travel, divine intervention and of course, growing up. <br />For those that do not know, this film was actually due to be released in October 2001, but because of the terrorist attacks in New York and the potentially inflammatory subject matter of the first 10 minutes of this film, it became `aviationally challenged' and when it finally did reach US cinemas, following the air crash in the Queens district, it predictably failed miserably. When it became available on US DVD though, it did very well, owing its success both to film critics & word of mouth publicity from great numbers of avid fans. <br />Darko was madeon a budget of around $4 million, but still Kelly managed to pull together one of the hottest upcoming casts seen in a film for a long time. Heard of Jake Gyllenhaal? His acting as Donnie is first rate & you can expect to see a whole lot more of him over the years. Drew Barrymore plays a somewhat unique teacher and her talent & above all reputation & influence is clearly just what this film needed. As an executive producer she is said to have provided much of the required foreign investment, as well as smoothing out a potentially disastrous legal battle between themselves & the creators of Smirfs, regarding comments over their possible sexual preferences. The most unexpected performance though is that brought by Patrick Swayze as the very dodgy self-help guru Jim Cunningham (not entirely dissimilar to Mr Jack Russell who recently spoke to the L6), best known for his book \\"Cunning visions of love\\". This film really kills Swayze's image, whatever it might have been, which makes this film all the more refreshing to watch.<br />Donnie Darko is a film which I strongly recommend watching, if only because its innovation & style mean that in the future many references will be made to it. The only area of this film that is possibly up for criticism is the ending, which many will find too irritatingly open-ended & plain difficult to work out. It is a film that will stay in the back of your mind for as long as it takes you to piece the puzzle together, but its well worth the wait. To quote another review - \\"Total confusion, in other words. It's a bit like falling in love.\\"
0792846443|5.0|I'll tell you why \\"Misery\\" is my favorite movie of all time. <br />They took a great novel (written by one of my favorite authors) and decided to make a movie about it. They decided to have James Caan (my favorite actor) and Kathy Bates (my favorite actress) star in it.<br />They stuck very closely to the plot and atmosphere of the novel. <br />Kathy Bates BECAME Annie Wilkes. You cannot ever read \\"Misery\\" without thinking of Kathy Bates. Rarely does anybody suit a role so perfectly. <br />Her psychotic Wilkes is not over the top nor understated. She plays the role just perfectly. She's completely mad but her insanity simmers beneath the surface. <br />The tension never lets up. Aside from the whimsical scenes between the local sherrif (the late Richard Farnsworth) and his wife (Frances Sternhagen), this film will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't read the novel or heard about the plot, your nerves will be FRAYED by the end of this!<br />I'm not exaggerating. See for yourself. I HIGHLY recommend this film.
1572522232|5.0|This is a very scary film. The basic story is that a ballerina finds out that her school is run by witches and the occult. There are a lot of gory scenes - women being cut up by barbed wires , a blind man being attacked by his own guide dog - but I think what really scares me is the soundtrack - such a creepy and at times fiercely black sounding it makes the film that bit more atmospheric ( a bit too much some might feel )<br />However if you're up for something gruesome this'll be the film for you
B00005JKMQ|3.0|In the words of Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) in \\"On The Waterfront\\", this coulda been a contenda. <br />But somehow it falls short of its potential. <br />My main gripe with this film is what most people praise it for.<br />Will Smith. <br />I think Smith was somehow overwhelmed by this role. He doesn't deliver that witty repertoire like the man himself. His voice actually trails off a lot of the time. Listen carefully and you'll see what I mean. Likewise, that expression on his face...He looks perpetually scared! I know many will disagree with me, but I think Smith was the wrong choice to play Ali.<br />Michael Mann directed the excellent \\"The Insider\\" so I was expecting more from this film. It isn't really much more than a retrospective of part of Ali's career. And most people know this part of the story. Ali wins the heavyweight title, converts to Nation of Islam, befriends Howard Cosell, gets screwed by the system, comes back and beats Foreman. No surprises there. <br />I was REALLY hoping the film would have focused on the more interesting and tragic part of Ali's career that followed the fight in Zaire. You know, when he got older, fought Frazier in Manila, turned to Sunni Islam, lost and regained the title from Leon Spinks, got screwed over by Don King, came back to fight Larry Holmes but was humiliated, retired and suffered from Parkinsons Syndrome, lit the torch at Atlanta, etc. <br />I was hoping for more of a biopic kind of feel. <br />\\"Ali\\" disappoints in this regard. It only focuses on 1966-1972. This is a shame. I think they could have shortened some of the fight scenes. I mean, this wasn't supposed to be a \\"Rocky\\" film but rather a film about Ali the man. <br />\\"Ali\\" is stylish and if you don't know a lot about Ali, you might enjoy this. I mean, it's a fascinating story up to that point. It's just something that's been told over water coolers and even at lecture halls all these years that you probably already know it. <br />Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Drew Bundini is great. I keep raving about how talented Mr. Foxx is. The way he took an obscure character and made it his own is remarkable. It might be worth waiting for this to air on cable just to see Foxx's performance. <br />I should add that the soundtrack for this movie is very good. If you like old time jazz/funk, just get the movie soundtrack.<br />So forget Ali. There's a James J. Braddock movie coming out next year. Let's hope they don't screw that up. BOXING RULES!
B00005Y1TL|4.0|RDJs finest ever committed to CD. Some of these tracks are not ambient per se but given that some of these tracks are recorded when Richie was only 14 it really does make the jaw drop as the CD and the songs are all magnificent. Worth paying your money for
B00007GZQI|5.0|I first saw \\"The Magic Christian\\" on WGN TV when I was a boy of about 9. Of course, it was butchered by editing, but still was a lot of fun. It took forever for me to get my hands on a rental tape of it when I was 22, and finally purchased a copy of my very own copy on DVD recently. The uncut version is much more fun!<br />The Plot.<br />Peter Sellers stars as Guy Grand, the richest man in the world. He finds a bum in the park, played by Ringo Starr, and adopts him as his only son and heir. He announces this to his company, and then fires all of the board members after showing them a silly cartoon of his new product, the giant car. From here on out, Peter Sellers and Ringo set about the show us all that everyone in the world has his price, and can be \\"bought\\", and bribed to do anything he asks. Some of the funniest scenes ever put to film are acted out before your very eyes, including these examples:<br />The Hunt: Guy Grand and son go on a hunt with some of the rich boys of the country club, and after a bit of discussion about the shotguns they all use, and the dogs go on point, Guy Grand calls in the artillery and flame throwers to make \\"a quick kill\\", much to the astonishment of the sportsmen hunting pheasant.<br />The Nazi Scene: On a Guy Grand train, Guy Grand and son play some nasty tricks on a former Nazi, to the extent that he questions his sanity.<br />The Auction Scene: Just before the auction at Sotheby's, a Rembrandt painting is purchased, and they mutilate the painting, cutting out the nose and throwing out the rest. Then they go on to the auction, where Peter Sellers bids in some very unusual ways.<br />The Roman Polanski and Yul Brenner scene: This one is so weird, Yul Brenner, dressed up as a woman, serenades the now exiled Polish movie maker.<br />The Hamlet Scene is also a favorite, you will never think of \\"To Be or not to Be\\", in the same light again!<br />Of course, the reason it is called the Magic Christian is because the two book passage on a cruise ship's maiden voyage from England to the USA, the \\"Social Must of the Season\\". Many more zany and weird adventures occur here, and drive the passengers crazy to the point of revolution, and they wish to smash capitalism. A surprise is awaiting them when they wish to leave the ship.<br />The entire musical score is by Paul Mcartney, and the music is very fitting. One more note about the cameos, here they are: Raquel Welsh, Yul Brenner, Richard Attenborough, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Roman Polanski, and Laurence Harvey.<br />See this movie, it is so weird and funny, you won't believe it!ge on a cruise ship's maiden voyage from England to the USA, the \\"Social Must of the Season\\".

B000002JKA|4.0|Coming off the masterful breakthrough \\"Images And Words,\\" Dream Theater came back with \\"Awake,\\" which very nearly manages to match its predecessor.  \\"Awake\\" once again demonstrates the band's awe-inspiring creativity and musicianship, but there are some surprises in store as well.  The bombast of \\"Images and Words\\" is still firmly in place, but \\"Awake\\" is clearly a different album, a bit darker and more metallic.  At eleven songs clocking in at seventy-five minutes, this is a taxing listen, but it's also a rewarding one.<br />The first thing that struck me about \\"Awake\\" was its heaviness.  I mean, this stuff is nowhere near as heavy as death metal, but it definitely ramps up the intensity from \\"Images and Words.\\"  The two opening tracks, \\"6:00\\" and \\"Caught in a Web\\" are both as heavy as anything on \\"I & W,\\" if not heavier.  James Labrie's vocals are at their harshest, John Petrucci's riffs and Mike Portnoy's drumming are crushing, and even Kevin Moore's keyboards are dark and aggressive.  The intricate melodies that define Dream Theater's sound are still present, but they're placed in a heavier context than previously.<br />Still, \\"Awake\\" doesn't fail to deliver the diversity that DT are known for.  The band slows things way down with the more ambient \\"Innocence Faded,\\" providing a nice break for those like their softer side.  \\"Erotomania,\\" the first part of the trilogy \\"A Mind Beside Itself,\\" is an excellent instrumental with lots of heavy riffs, strong melodies, and some cool acoustic guitar and piano work.  The seven-minute \\"The Mirror\\" and the eleven-minute \\"Scarred\\" are epics that exemplify the balance of melody and heaviness that really makes DT what they are.  Probably my favorite song here, though, is \\"Lie,\\" where James's aggressive vocals and John's twisted riffing combine to create a very dark and chilling atmosphere.  It's a captivating song, full of emotion that matches the downcast lyrics.<br />As I've already said, \\"Awake\\" is very, very long.  With material this good, that's not a huge issue, but I did find my attention wavering more with this album than with \\"Images and Words.\\"  And as good a singer as he is, I do think James was trying a slightly too hard on this album.  For the most part he's excellent, but sometimes he tries to go a bit too high and intense, and he can't quite make it; I think a bit more restraint may have been called for.  However, these are minor complaints.  For musicianship and songwriting, Dream Theater are hard to beat, and \\"Awake\\" is no exception.aterial this good, that's not a huge issue, but I did find my attention wavering more with this album than with \\"Images and Words.\\"  And as good a singer as he is, I do think James was trying a slightly too hard on this album.

B00005RHGK|4.0|In a world where horror movies are nothing but stupid films about some psycho running around killing half-naked ... girls and dumb pretty-boy jocks for no real reason, this movie takes a different direction. this is a monster movie. i think it was done really well. if you haven't seen it, check it out.
B000002JPA|5.0|Obviously Dream Theater isn't for everyone, but since I started listening to them a few months ago I've been rather puzzled when people I've seen people criticize them with adjectives like &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;self-indulgent.&quot;  Sure, they write lots of long songs with complicated structures, but I think if they can then they should.  I don't think there are a lot of bands that can do what Dream Theater do, so I see no reason for them to waste their abilities on less ambitious music.  Saying Dream Theater are pretentious because they write complex songs strikes me as sort of like saying Einstein was pretentious because he talked about physics all the time, or Michaelangelo was pretentious because he did lots of sculptures.  Well, duh!  If you have the ability to do something unique, you should.  End of story.<br />Besides, I think it's obvious listening to Dream Theater just how much craftsmanship they put into their music.  I've heard some pretentious music in my time, and this stuff just doesn't fit that description.  The band writes some of the best and most interesting melodies around, and they also prove themselves experts at balancing foot-tapping melody and and head-banging heaviness.  Sometimes Dream Theater are mellow, and other times they blast forward full-speed, and it's never easy to tell what's coming next.<br />A sound as complex and diverse as Dream Theater's certainly requires a lot of skill to pull off, but fortunately the band is clearly more than up to the task.  Guitarist John Petrucci is a master, perhaps the best in all of metal.  He pounds out plenty of pummelling riffs, and his solos are often super-fast, but he always fits his playing into the songs, never losing his melodic sensibility.  Drummer Mike Portnoy is sort of a mix of Rush's Neil Peart and Slayer's Paul Bostaph, combining prog-rock precision with metal aggression.  On keyboards, Kevin Moore provides some extra ambience, and also contributes some hair-raising solos of his own (the occasional use of piano is a nice touch as well).  John Myung's thumping, insinuating basslines provide a rock-solid foundation in the background.  And James Labrie is a monster on vocals, mixing operatic grace and range with sheer metallic power.<br />My favorite songs on this album are the four epics, &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; &quot;Take the Time,&quot; &quot;Metropolis Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper,&quot; and &quot;Learning to Live.&quot;  All four demonstrate a level of musicianship and diversity that are almost unparalleled, in metal or any other genre.  At more than eight minutes apiece, these songs are loaded with the intricate melodies, ever-changing structures, and dizzying instrumental passages that make Dream Theater such a great band.  The other four songs are basically filler material, but as filler goes they're pretty good.  I'd take Dream Theater's filler over a lot of the other stuff that's out there, that's for sure.<br />If there was a point to this rather long-winded review, it's this: Dream Theater are not pretentious. I'm sure there are many out there who won't &quot;get&quot; what they're doing, but given the overwhelming banality of mainstream radio, I think we need bands like DT now more than ever.  Sure they aim a little bit high, but they clearly have the talent to pull it off.  So put the Puddle of Mudd CD down and pick this one up.

B000002I6X|5.0|In 1971 it looked like Stephen Stills was the member of  the recently disbanded CSN&amp;Y who would go on to bigger and better things.  He had already had a massively successful self titled solo debut and had a few hit singles.  But of course when the time came to record a solo follow up, it seemed the only place Stills could go was down.  In many ways he does as on a whole this record is weaker than his brilliant debut or his later Manassas album.  However Stills song writing is still excellent here and it's the majority of strong songs on this album that kept it from being a complete self indulgent disaster.  <br />As I mentioned before Stills songwriting is in top form here with such songs as the twangy country rocker CHANGE PARTNERS and the fast paced rocker MARIANNE (both were minor hits).  The extremely powerful SUGAR BABE also should have been a single as well.  NOTHIN' TO DO BUT TODAY is a great guitar rocker.  While FISHES AND SCORPIONS and KNOW YOU GOT TO RUN have some excellent (almost apocolyptic) lyricism.  OPEN SECRET and SINGIN' CALL also display his brilliant poetic lyrics.  However other songs here have not stood the test of time as well.  RELAXING TOWN is a silly rocker with strange lyrics .  WORD GAME is Stills' attempt to be like a preaching Bob Dylan.  Whereas ECOLOGY SONG and BLUEBIRD REVISITED are somewhat overblown self indulgent orchestrated pieces.  Not that these songs are terrible but I just can't understand why Stills would have an entire orchestra backing him up.  It seemed almost as if he were trying to better himself only it back fired and these songs suffered unfortunetly.<br />Overall this is still a good album.  As I had said before the majority of songs on this album are very strong.  Nothing is particularily unlistenable here it just that the heavy orchestration on OPEN SECRET, BLUEBIRD REVISITED and THE ECOLOGY SONG were not necessary. In reality this album probably only desreves 4 stars but i'm giving it <BR>4 1/2 (I have to round up to 5) particualrily since a lot of people give this album a tough time but it's just as good as anything Neil Young ever put out in my opinion.  Highly recommended!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Firstly let me say, I was Donnie's age in 88. This film is so amazingly like what it was like to be a weird depressed high school aged loser in the late 80's, trust me I was one. I loved this film, it's so beautifully written and directed with a killer soundtrack.  Note to the director: Please do a directors cut and put all the deleted scenes back in the film! I found they all just enhanced the film even more. I'm going to watch this again.  It's a stunner.
B000002U9L|5.0|Labyrinth is a well performed movie, and well written. Jennifer Connelly did a spectacular job on her character! David Bowie couldn't have done any better. His music was phenominal, for lack of a better word, not to mention his acting. The entire cast did a spectacular job. The plot is great, and as said before, very well written. The music, was outstanding and should have won millions of gramys and awards. As the movie went on, it captavated any one lucky enough to view it. The art was amazing. My hats of the Jim Henson. I can not stress the effectivness of the music. Bully for David Bowie and Terry Jones. The music added so much to the movie, and would not be as great as it is, without it. I would strongly recomend anyone going out and seeing it. It is the best movie of all time.
0151006903|1.0|I read &quot;The Name Of The Rose&quot; and loved every page.  This, by comparason, was a big let down.  Slow going, and I can't say I was ever really interested.  Would not suggest.
B000002HRE|5.0|For all you people that consistently say that Metallica sold out, you are living in the past.  What would everyone say if Metallica never changed their style and still had long hair and played thrash?  They would say that Metallica needs to mature and grow out of that style.  Anyway you look at it, Metallica is between a rock and a hard place.  Needless to say, I am glad that they matured and changed their style.  This and Load are Metallica's best.  Imagine if they would have been released as a double disc album at the same time.  That would have been awesome.  I am so sick of people complaining that they've sold out when actually all they've done is progressed greatly.  Another good example of this &quot;sold out&quot; nonsense is Disturbed's new cd, &quot;believe&quot;.  I actually read reviews that said that Disturbed sold out when, again, all they did was progress and mature a little bit.  Anyway, back to the subject at hand.  If you actually listen to Load and Reload, you will most definitely notice how much better Metallica has gotten as musicians.  James' voice is lightyears ahead of the pre-black album era.  Lars' drumming is superb to what is was.  Kirk's solos and Jason's bass playing are much better, too.  Don't listen to all of the &quot;so-called&quot; Metallica fans.  I am a real fan.  Trust me.  If you think you are a real Metallica fan and you don't own this and/or Load, you should be ashamed of yourself.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Gotta love lesbian duos.  Heh.  As a gay male musician, I find that open and honest homosexual artists (especially in the music and acting biz) are few and far between.  So what first drew me to this duo was their killer video for the song \\"All The Things She Said\\".  A friend told me about it, saying, \\"They're like, all making out and stuff!\\"  I just had to see it for myself, and I watched it.  It's a sweet video, and the kissing and other romantic antics are far from inappropriate or obscene...in fact, they're downright heartfelt.  Knowing the affections in their video were real and not an act made it innocent and beautiful.  But then again, I am a bit overly-sentimental when it comes to romance.<br />Okay, so on to the musical critique...I went out and bought the album the day after I heard/saw the music video.  I loved the song.  I would have given the album 5 stars but I took off half a star for the almost-too-similar sound of all the songs.  Luckily, they depart from their norm just enough times to keep me from getting bored.  The other half a star was docked because I can't get this CD to play on my computer...I'm assuming this is due in part to the music industry's ongoing efforts to stop piracy.  So basically, i didn't care, but since they don't have half-star ratings, I went ahead and docked my superfluous half-star.<br />Anyway, if you've heard and liked the single \\"All The Things She Said\\", DEFINITELY get this album.
0446608955|5.0|I loved this book. A Walk To Remember is an intriging book that made me cry and jump for joy at the same time.  After reading this book i watched the movie, although it was a good movie it could not match the writing in the book.  This book helped me to realize that being on top is not what high school is all about.  I think all people should read this because it gives you persective on life!!! I recommend this book very highly to all ages!!!!!!!
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is the best album ever. Some people would say it's the best album ever recorded, but that's stupid. What else would it be, the best album ever baked? That's pretty stupid.

B00005JL96|1.0|I am surprised that Disney would put together an animated feature with so much negativity! I am equally surprised that so many reviews for this movie are POSITIVE!! Isn't anyone watching this movie with the eyes of a four-year-old? Here is what a four-year-old sees:<br />1. Stitch - An EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE alien creature, adopted and loved by a little girl. I have watched my 3 1/2 year old daughter construct and proceed to destroy set-ups of her toys in the same Godzilla-like fashion Stitch displays in the movie. Somehow it's OK for Stitch to destroy everything in his path, and he does finally learn not to do that, but that lesson is lost on a small child.<br />2. Lilo - A BRAT of a child! She nails the front door shut with about a hundred nails with her sister/guardian trapped outside. What parent would want their child to get this idea and possibly act it out? Not me! There are countless other bratty, stubborn exchanges between Lilo and her sister that my daughter just loves to copy. What sort of behaviors do we want Disney to teach and/or reinforce? Not these!!<br />3. Lilo's sister - How about this poor excuse of a guardian? Why do we want to depict this type of &quot;family&quot; that has no structure in a movie directed at young children? Have we really gotten to the point as a society that we believe this type of family is acceptable?<br />I consider myself to be pretty open and like to expose my children to many types of music, movies, books and all sorts of activities from which they can be entertained and learn something in the process. This is the first Disney movie that I've ever taken away from my children because I am tired of my daughter playing out the types of behaviors displayed in this movie, and I don't want my son to begin to learn these behaviors as well. I hope this isn't a direction that Disney plans to continue in.<br />If you have preschoolers, I'd recommend you skip buying this movie. I'm not sure at what age a child would understand notto copy the behaviors I've only sampled in this review, so take it under advisement if your children are a little older. Children are VERY impressed by the things they watch on TV, regardless of whether you watch with them or not, or try to explain that it's only a movie-not the way you behave in real life.<br />BOOO! HISSSSS! Disney, what are you doing???
B00005V9IK|4.0|When I first saw this I was six so I was scared and didn't see it again untill I was twelve.  No eleven oh well I wanted to buy it but didnt.
B00005R8GU|5.0|&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; showcases Muddy Waters and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band all at their all-time Chicago blues best.  I recently received the album and cannot stop listening to it.  Although each song is a gem, my personal favorite is &quot;Forty Days and Forty Nights&quot; - Muddy's soulful singing combined with Butterfield's wailing harmonica riffs interwoven are just great to listen to (plus, it reminds me why I took up blues harp in the first place).  This album, along with Muddy's subsequent &quot;Hard Again,&quot; is that unadulterated, down-home, &quot;slap-ya-momma&quot; type of blues that comes straight from the heart, and is a must-have for any blues lover.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my husband for Christmas. He was quite pleased to receive it. He had watched several of the episodes on HBO when it was on tv, but also missed several of the episodes. It was so real and authentic. Very good portral of what really happened.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot has some of the catchier pop songs I've heard in quite some time.  My advice for those wondering whether to believe the hype about this album is this:  Happier is better than sad.  Therefore, when you listen to this CD, program it to play these songs only:<br />Kamera<br />War on War<br />Heavy Metal Drummer<br />I'm The Man Who Loves You<br />Pot Kettle Black<br />That said, I believe Wilco's at their very best when they lighten up and smile.  Note to Jeff Tweedy:  There's nothing wrong with writing a whole album's worth of good, simple, toe-tapping pop songs.  That's High Art, too.  Four Englishmen who called themselves the Beatles did it awfully well.<br />There's no need for Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett to write such pretentious dreck as Ashes of American Flags just for pointy-headed critics, especially in light of the five seemingly effortless pop gems that grace this CD.  Have some more fun, Wilco!
B000000WA4|5.0|Regarded and revered as one of the most influential and diverse bands of the 90's, the peak of the Pumpkin's popularity came with Mellon Collie, the critical and commercial success that expanded on the previous (and some say even better) Siamese Dream.  To be true I'd never actually heard any Smashing Pumpkin songs before coming to college, but have since become one of the vast legion of people that realise them to be one of the best bands of recent years.<br />Billy Corgan's roots and influences are so diverse to the extent that they are almost untraceable.  Drawing from an impressive variety of genres including rock, metal, folk and classical there is not one track on here that seems out of place, and that is probably the album's stroke of genius.  A diverse album isn't necessarily a difficult thing to produce - what's difficult is making sure it all fits together, so that the rock songs don't feel uncomfortable next to the folk numbers.  This is exactly what the band manages.  The classical first track easily blends into the romantic, dreamy vision of Tonight, Tonight, which doesn't seem odd sat next to the much heavier tracks Jellybelly and Zero.<br />Composed of two CDs, comprising of Dawn to Dusk and Twilight to Starlight this has the feel and sound of an epic, a lifetime in music as seen through the eyes of Billy Corgan, and it's this very quality that makes Mellon Collie so unique.  And it's not just stylistically and musically that the songs are good, lyrically they're rich and intelligent.  Several of the tracks manage to gradually seep into your consciousness because of this, namely Porcelina of the Vast Oceans, which contains the kind of poetic lyrics that attain the 'beautiful' moniker that other artists can only dream about.  Others meanwhile will hit you straight away, such as the deservedly celebrated Bullet With Butterfly Wings.  On the second CD the singles obviously stand out, Thirty-Three and 1979.  One's a gorgeous piece that incorporates strings to brilliant effect, the other almost sounds like the universal theme that sums up your adolescense and everything you feel/felt about that time in your life.  Music of this kind is rare to the point of being practically extinct.  Of course, I could go on explaining why the intricacies of each song made it special but that's the job of the individual listener.<br />Mellon Collie is close to impossible to dislike and whilst some say it's not as good as Siamese Dream (personally I'd say they were about the same), there's no denying its immensity, the work that's obviously gone into it and the wide scope of Billy Corgan's vision.  This truly is an album of epic proportions, and a must for everyone's record collection.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I'm really enjoying the recent trend in Hollywood to revive the 'movie musical' genre. Whilst Moulin Rouge acheived a degree of success and paved the way for Chicago to be made, it attempted to reinvent the movie musical with popular music. Chicago, a Broadway musical currently experiencing a very successful revival, keeps the wonderful sounds that we have come to expect from a Broadway show.<br />This recording of Chicago stays very close to the original Broadway roots - very little attempt has been made to 'beef up' the score. This recording is as wonderfully emotive and inspiring as other recordings and this allows the performance of the performers to shine through.<br />Another consideration for purchasing this CD is to find out how 'non singing' Hollywood actors scrub up in the vocal department.<br />Overall, they succeed brillantly. Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger prove that they have what it takes to characterise the roles of Velma and Roxie through voice alone. Queen Latifah is also very good; however I feel her performance could have been slightly more 'gutsy'. The role of Matron Mumma Morton is one of a tough prison Matron and Queen Latifah falls slightly short of delivering this convincingly. John C Reilly is adequate as Amos Hart - his one number, 'Mr Cellophane' is good but doesn't really stand out. Richard Gere, on the other hand, is below average as Billy Flynn. Most of the time he seems to be speaking the lyrics rather than singing them - though still entertaining and enjoyable. When you're used to Broadway performers belting out these numbers with their highly experienced voices, it's hard not to compare. With this in consideration, the 'Hollywood' actors did a fine job and kudos to them for taking a risk and baring their other talents for the world to see.<br />One big disappointment with this recording is that several numbers from the Broadway score are missing. Whilst I appreciate that not all songs could be included in the film dueto time constraints, it would have been nice if the cast had recorded the entire score for this CD release. So I won't be throwing my Broadway Revival Cast Recording away anytime soon.<br />It is nice to see that Kander and Ebb wrote a new song for the film - 'I Move On'. A wonderful song, and it's great to see they have lost none of their songwriting prowess after all these years after first writing the original Chicago score. A couple of very atmospheric instumental movie pieces are included as well as 2 'pop' songs, supposedly inspired by the movie. Obviously an attempt to bring the soundtrack into the conscience of a more youth orientated market - at which they succeed. Effective 'pop' music designed to hit the charts then disappear and be forgotten. <br />A novel feature of the CD is the inclusion of 'connectD' techology. Place the CD into your computers' CD rom drive and you can access a special website with interviews and behind the scenes footage. This is a wonderful bonus and it's great to see producers being orginal in their attempt to reduce piracy by offering additional material rather than having the CD crash your computer.<br />Whilst this recording is not without it's flaws, it is a wonderful recreation of (most) of the original score. It is also interesting from the aspect of listening to famous, usually non singing actors perform Broadway tunes. If you love Chicago and love the movie version, this is a great CD to add to your collection.
B0000214F3|1.0|Meet Joe Black tries very hard to be a Significant Movie, but fails miserably.  It certainly has many of the constituent parts of a classic film including a three-hour running time, a respected senior actor teamed with Hollywood heartthrobs, and an orchestral score.  Unfortunately the music is also intrusive and overly sentimental, the film is at least an hour too long, and Claire Forlani irritatingly spends most of it in tears (although Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are adequate in their roles).     <br />Hopkins plays Bill Parrish, a media mogul squillionaire whom everybody loves.  We are expected to believe this without question, despite the fact that he is irritable, insensitive and patronisingly patriarchal towards his daughters.  The hands of fate have decreed that it is Bill's time to die, but over the millennia Death has become curious about the ways of people and offers Bill a bargain.  In return for a guided tour of the thing we know as life, Bill will be allowed to continue living for an unspecified length of time.  Of course Bill has a beautiful daughter (so Death can fall in love), a Machiavellian business partner (so Death can prove that he is really a good guy), and assorted family crises which provide the fodder for seemingly endless poignant glances. <br />Perhaps the only thing that the film gets right is the sensual undressing sequence, with Pitt and Forlani proving that incredibly slow is also incredibly sexy.  That however, is the one bright point in a movie that waffles along towards its drawn out and saccharine conclusion.  And as far as conclusions go, it's pretty lame.  Don't watch this - you've got better things to do with your life.
0316666343|3.0|Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones, her debut, celebrates Grace in form of a tragedy. The author starts you off from a very unfortunate loss which initially brought Susie's family to turmoil and eventual redemption to hope and grace; even for Susie herself. The book may have more room for some more pages of character and plot development. But altogether, the book is a moving experience. It is indeed an affirmation of the idea that life goes on. Except this one leaves a comfortable smile of promise in your heart.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Well first and foremost I would like to say that this song is truly a good song. It can relate to many people ... The meaning of the words is more than enough and I think this is a hit song. Hopefully, people will like it just like I did. Now, it's not just this song but their whole cd is amazing. I hope they get more cd's out because these girls to my knowledge are very talented. Keep up the good work!
6304708491|5.0|As much as I love &quot;A 'Hard Day's Night&quot;, I still prefer &quot;Help!&quot;<BR>I have the video and the DVD and I have practically worn out both<BR>copies.  I was fortunate to see the movie when it first came out in August 1965 (I was 9 years old) and that was the second time I witnessed &quot;Beatlemania&quot; in the movie theatre.  Screaming girls throughout the film.  <BR>Those memories stuck with me throughout the years and whenever I watch &quot;Help!&quot; I still feel &quot;young at heart&quot;.  Granted many critics dismissed this film when it first was released.  I suppose they were expecting another &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;.  This film is pure fantasy.  The comedy is great but the music is even better.  The Help! CD is one of my favorite Bealtes' CDs.<BR>Richard Lester is a brilliant director.  He knew The Beatles' limitations as actors and used them accordingly.  <BR>In this film you can see how The Beatles practically invented the music video.  Eg.  The Ticket to Ride sequence.<BR>To me this film was everything I could ever hope for in a Beatles' movie.  Humour, great music and a steady pace...never boring.<BR>In fact, I think I will watch it again this afternoon.<BR>Thank you.
B000002MT0|5.0|This is an extremley eclectic work of art! This is a dark album that shows some of Prince's most creative and futuristic works of his career. &quot;Space&quot; is amazing! A tripped out cyber space mid tempo jam that takes you to another place. &quot;Come&quot; is a perfect Prince Illustration at his best the beat is funky as Hell! &quot;Letitigo&quot; is a Masterpiece futuristic with the funk and slap bass that made him famous! This is a work of art, a mile stone in prince's collection. I love trip Hop music so the darkness,Funk and the Innovative production is what I like to hear from him. I wish he would do more material like this for the new millenium ! Come Back, Come Back, were are You? The man is a genius noone will every top him ! This is a work that pioneered the new generation of artist today.  If you find this album interesting get &quot;Emancipation and Crystal Ball&quot;
B00003CXXM|5.0|I usually cringe during actions flicks, but I loved every minute of &quot;Bourne.&quot;  The acting by Damon is wonderful and the story is great.  I highly suggest everyone give this movie a try, whether you love action/thillers or not.  The &quot;fight&quot; scenes are not to be missed!
6304698798|3.0|Thoroughly disappointed!  The sound is HORRIBLE!  It says it's &quot;Dolby Digital&quot; and while I didn't expect 21st century, state of the art 5.1 surround sound, I was shocked to find nothing but a mono center channel.  IT'S NOT EVEN IN STEREO!  (I was so stunned by the lousy audio that I didn't watch it long enough to see how the video looks.)  Great movie, a &quot;psychedelic western&quot;, I like to call it, I'm taking it back (I hope the store will take it, it's been opened).  Lets hope someone redoes this DVD and at least gives it two channel audio.  Sheesh, what the heck were they thinking?
0451450523|5.0|Reading The Last Unicorn is like reading a poem. Its word seem to flow from the pages like unicorns out of the sea. The story is deep and moving, as good as The Lord of the Rings, but certainly not a rip-off or cheap copy. The Last Unicorn is in a class of fantasy (and literature,) all of its own! It is a timeless tale that follows a unicorn who leaves her beloved lilac wood to discover the fate of the world's unicorns. She is eventually joined by two companion, a clumsy wizard named Schmendrick, and a depressed cook named Molly. As they help the unicorn fulfill her quest, they begin journeys of their own, and explore their own true potentials. You'll be drawn into the story of the these adventurers as their road takes them to King Haggards country, where it is believed all the unicorns were pushed long ago. The Last Unicorn is full of wonders and stunning words that will keep you reading it again and again! To quote Schmendrick, \\"There are no happy endings because nothing ever ends.\\"
078322737X|5.0|Before George Lucas took us all to a galaxy far, far away, he made this comedy classic, which is still by far his greatest film. Good story, great script, fine performances from the entire cast and of course one of the greatest soundtracks in film history. Lucas should have made more films like this instead of confining himself to sci-fi (not that I dislike Star Wars though). A true classic in every sense and a MUST SEE!!!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Rage Against The Machine stood out as one of the few rap metal acts with a shred of credibility--a breath of fresh air in an era full of turgid, sophomoric nu-metal (Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, et al).<br />I was amazed by RATM's 1992 debut, despite the sometimes overblown political rhetoric. I rank it among my Top 30 favorite albums alongside classics like MC5's Kick Out The Jams, The Clash's London Calling, and Metallica's Ride The Lightning. Zack De La Rocha's speed-rapping spray of vitriol and Tom Morello's virtiostic guitar playing never fails to get me headbanging.<br />By that standard, The Battle Of LA has some big shoes to fill. While I considered this album underwhelming at first, I eventually found that it is almost as capable as the debut and a far better album than Evil Empire.<br />Aside from Born As Ghosts, which is pretty dull, there are no bad songs on the album. The band is as always a well-oiled machine. Morello shows that he is capable and unique as ever as he unleashes blasts of funk on Calm Like A Bomb, turntable-like effects on Maria and Mic Check, and straight ahead blast-your-eardrums rock on Sleep Now In The Fire and Born Of A Broken Man. He also pushes his guitar to new limits with the electronic-sounding bleeps of Ashes In The Fall. On the intro to Testify, Morello unleashes a sheet of eviscerating guitar that is pure Rage.<br />Zach unleashes his white-hot fury too, ravaging the government at every turn and rapping with the intensity of a revolutionary. He was the perfect match to the band. Though he is a great singer, Chris Cornell can't match Zach's power and unique delivery, and Audioslave sounds fairly ordinary as a result.<br />The downfall of The Battle Of LA is that it's ultimately a lyrical retread of the first two efforts. The \\"Free Mumia!\\" rhetoric lacks punch after it's been repeated twice before. Still, it's a strong final effort from one of the great bands of the 90's. Recommended.
B000002MFE|5.0|Tears In Heaven is a beautiful song. The best acoustic album I have ever heard. Eric Claptons guitar and voice are so soothing and moving. I love this album. I have been listening to it for years and I never get tired of it. I want to be buried with this album. Thanks eric for this beautiful music
B0000649EQ|5.0|I loved this movie from it went out. And now it is completed with a new musical, I love it twice as much!!! Also, it`s great that it comes in the original version and the platinum, and in spanish and french too.  Great for any Disney fan!!!
B000021YQV|5.0|Unlike their dissapointing first album, &quot;Toxicity&quot; distinguishes System of a Down as both talented and crazy - in a good way. They keep a melodic rage throughout that by the end of the album leaves one breathless. Here is a song by song breakdown:<br />1) Prison Song - A humorous and to the point first track. Great beat. 9/10<BR>2) Needles - An average song that left me indifferent. 6/10<BR>3) Deer Dance - The first completely serious political track that is interesting throughout and makes headbangers out of us all. 8/10<BR>4) Jet Pilot - Another average song, seemed a little dull. 5/10<BR>5) X - A filler track that doesn't distinguish itself. 5/10<BR>6) Choy Suey - Up to this point the album had two great songs, and then a bunch of average music that took up space. This song changed that - it is a classic song that got me back in gear. Truly emotional. 10/10<BR>7) Bounce - A good counter balance to the prior track that made things ligther. A good party rocker. 8/10<BR>8) Forest - A tad long and drawn out, but it has good parts. 7/10<BR>9) Atwa - A great intro followed by pure havoc. One of the best songs on the album that should have been a single. 10/10<BR>10) Science - Kicks it up a notch from Atwa, and includes a great middle easter guitar rift near the middle. The only flaw is that it is a bit repetative at points. 9/10<BR>11) Shimmy - This song seems to have no purpose or beat, and just gets skipped. 4/10<BR>12) Toxicity - The best song on the album that is similar to Chop Suey in that it is both harmonic and full of rage at the same time. 10/10<BR>13) Psycho - A good song that has an interesting hook, and good harmony near the middle. A good choice for a single. 9/10<BR>14) Aerials - A great last track that is full of harmony. A great way to end an album. 10/10<BR>HT) Arto - No lyrics, but a good fade out track with middle eastern flavor. 7/10<br />Although it had a bit too much filler at times, it rose above that because of its melodic rage.
B000066NW0|3.0|A few things--<BR>First of all, it's refreshing to hear an alto put out an album, even though Avril has a while to go before her voice matures (give her a break--most people don't get their mature voice until they reach thirty or so...).<BR>Second, I think her lyrics will mature with her voice.  <BR>&quot;Complicated&quot; has the unfortunate status of being overplayed, but it's still a fun song, and while the chord changes and harmonies aren't all that unique, it remains a good listen.<BR>The guitar lines on &quot;Unwanted&quot; fill out the song rather nicely, completing the, well, frustrated mood of it.<BR>I think she uses swear words too casually, especially on a song like &quot;I'm with you&quot;, and I hope she grows out of this--perhaps it will come with increasing lyric maturity.
B000005IS1|5.0|What can I say about this classic? This was the official introduction of punk rock, about 6 or 7 years before the Ramones broke into the big time. It's loud, it's brash, it's powerful--and it's LIVE! Could you ask for more?<br />Nevermind J.C Crawford's onstage rhetoric. For rock 'n' roll the music forged onstage the night of 10/31/68 was the revolution. Rarely has a band been so joyously messy, chaotic, and aggressive. It takes me for a ride every time I listen to it--from the hard rocker Ramblin' Rose and the controversial title track (\\"KICK OUT THE JAMS you mutha...kers!\\") to the free jazz-meets-garage rock Sun Ra cover Starship, Kick Out The Jams never fails to get me amped. Too bad I wasn't born in time to see them live.<br />Play it LOUD. It's like having a party in your head.
0316666343|5.0|I read this in two sittings which is something of a record for me.  I was so drawn in by the characters and the wonderful premise, I couldn't put it down.  I thought it was going to be sad, but it was actually incredibly inspiring.  I can't recommend this highly enough.
B00005RDSM|5.0|It`s great!!! I love that it has the spanish track also for muy baby. Great buy!!!
B00007E8V4|4.0|A great compilation, but fails to mesh at times. Also why &quot;The Metro wasn't included is baffling. <br />1) Chic N' Stu- 9/10 (Funny, and political.)<BR>2) Innervision- 10/10 (A great song that should have been on Toxicity - because it doesn't fit as well on this album.)<BR>3) Bubbles- 9/10 (Pure rage, should have replaced Jet Pilot.)<BR>4) Boom!- 9/10 (Poetry to music - literally.)<BR>5) Nuguns- 2/10 (Annoying...)<BR>6) ADD- 10/10 (Jumps starts it from Nuguns, a tough feat.)<BR>7) Mr. Jack- 10/10 (Should be their next single. Much like Spiders in its melody.)<BR>8) I-E-A-I-A-I-O- 9/10 (Great chorus and humorous lyrics.)<BR>9) 36 - 3/10 (Pure filler.)<BR>10) Pictures- 7/10 (Fast, but little depth.)<BR>11) Highway Song- 9/10 (Dramatic and insightful.)<BR>12) F**k the System!- 6/10 (Too much mumbling.)<BR>13) Ego Brain- 8/10 (Great background, average lyrics.)<BR>14) Thetawaves- 4/10 (No purpose, a poor song.)<BR>15) Roulette- 9/10 (Great lyrics, should have had a bit more of a beat.)<BR>16) Streamline- 7/10 (Sounds cobbled together, as you can tell becuase it is a different version than there was in Scorpion King.)
B00003CXXM|1.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  The movie is too long and I found it confusing.  It was hard to focus on the plot while at the same time trying to figure out who all the characters were.  At the same time, Damon as Jason makes some pretty stupid decisions. I just didn't buy any of it.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Born from the ashes of the stoner rock band Kyuss, Queens Of The Stone Age does share some similarities to Kyuss. Yet Songs For The Deaf does not fall under the rubrick of stoner rock. It's more like alternative rock, in the tradition of Soundgarden's Superunknown and The Screaming Trees' Sweet Oblivion. It also recalls Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience to some extent.<br /><br />Songs For The Deaf is quite diverse, from the screaming speed metal of You Ain't Worth A Dollar.., followed by slightly skewered pop songs like No One Knows and Go With The Flow, and the downright ominous God Is In The Radio and Song For The Deaf. It even goes into orchestration (Mosquito Song). The lyrics are dark and intelligent.<br /><br />And man, does it rock. Homme's amazing guitarwork and laidback falsetto and Oliveri's awesome howls are accompanied by Dave Grohl's heroic drumming. The fact that he decided to go back on the kit in Songs For The Deaf is reason enough to buy this album right NOW.<br /><br />My pick for favorite is the excellent Song For The Dead, a 6-minute track packing great guitar runs, bursts of organ, incredible drumming, and ominous moaned vocals. Not a single wasted note anywhere, and you will want to hear it over and over again.<br /><br />Songs For The Deaf is not perfect--Six Shooter is pointless and Another Love Song and Gonna Leave You are poppy, redundant soundalikes. The fake DJ interludes, while amusing the first few listens, can become annoying. But if you're tired of all the nu-metal junk flooding the airwaves, buy your copy of Songs For The Deaf and crank the volume knob up high.

If you think i rated this album a bit high please note that i am a fan who has never been let down by them.
B000007T1M|2.0|In the music industry most bands start out with a great first album and then sellout and fade away into the sun set. System of a Down has done the exact opposite - they have crafted two great albums (\\"Toxicity,\\" \\"Steal This Album\\") focusing on politics and a mixture of controled rage and harmony. On the otherhand their first self titled album consists of just idle yelling and it is surprising that it sold well enough to warrant the classic \\"Toxicity\\" to be made. It has only two songs of note, Ddevil and Spiders. Ddevil's drum beat make it a caustic track along the lines of Bounce on Toxicity. Spiders on the other hand can't be compared to anything else, it is pure harmony.<br />However the rest of the album is pure trash, including the hit Sugar. Not one other song sounds remotely intelligent or thought out in the way in which they are recorded.<br />So don't bother with this unless you can't find Spiders and Ddevil on the internet - and go buy \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album.\\"

B00005JKQZ|5.0|For those of us who have read the novel by Sylvia Nasar, this movie will come as a complete surprise.    I remember sitting in the theatre in complete confusion thru portions of the film.  The confusion, however, was finally replaced by the realization of what the makers of this movie were trying to do.<br />The 3 imagined characters were pure fiction and much of the movie was highly fabricated.   The film also entirely omitted the object of Nash's first affair, Eleanor, as well as the son he fathered by her, John David.   <br />As all good movies do, this film had its reasons for proceeding thus.  The story is about Nash's courtship and marriage of Alicia.  It was during this period in his life that he experienced his biggest bouts with mental illness, which is also central to the theme.  To have included Eleanor and John David would have made the movie much longer and the film would have lost its focus.<br />As for Nash's illness itself, to give an accurate account would have made the film wander about without any real direction (which is exactly what Nash himself DID do for several years).   The 3 fictional characters are installed to bring the film a cohesive plot as well as a storyline with a considerable degree of symmetry.<br />Ron Howard does an outstanding job directing this film.  The cast, featuring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Jennifer Connoley, is magnificent.  Particularly impressive is Crowe as this role is so very different from his notable performance in GLADIATOR.<br />This is a film that I would recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection.  Movies about the lives of atheletes are commonplace, but films that detail the stories of intellectuals are exceedingly scarce.  For that reason alone, I would admonish all persons to watch this movie.<br />Ultimately, this movie is a REPRESENTATION of Nash's life as opposed to a glossing over of actual events.   However, in Hollywood, as well as storytelling in general, style is something that may trump veracity.  For those who want the full story I recommend Nasar's book by the same name.
6305537798|5.0|We watched this movie in my Shakespeare class, and I definitely fell in love with it. If you're an avid Shakespeare fan, then you can point out all the similarities and differences between this movie and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. If not, then you can just love the movie for what it is.<br />It's worth buying this movie. We recorded it off of USA and they've cut so much of the movie.
B000024ASD|5.0|One of the weirdest and most exciting novelty albums I ever encountered came out in 1986 in Britain and didn't make its way to the states till the following year.  Looking at it, I see that it was way ahead of its time in its techno-punk hybrid, random sampling, and a product of the computer and technology-obsessed 1980's.<br />\\"Love Missile F1-11\\" opens with Martin Degville crying out \\"I Wanna Be A Star\\" before the signature Sputnik sound, a backbeat of quick-paced Generation X-ish technodisco punctuated by an electropump bass, combined with sliding punk guitar, computerizing samples of Beethoven's 9th, the William Tell overture, Japanese vocals, Ms. Pacman dying, distorted effects.  This song featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  A few lines condemn a vision of Reagan's America:  \\"U.S. bombs floating overhead.\\" and \\"multi-millions still unfed.<br />\\"Atari Baby\\" would be Sputnik's equivalent of Billy Idol's \\"Eyes Without A Face\\", a quiet song with a running percussive beat and the usual effects, with some female vocalists going \\"d-d-d-d..aah aah\\".<br />\\"Sex Bomb Boogie\\" is as crazy as \\"Love Missile\\", opening with that piercing space guitar and the pounding technodisco.  There are a few weird effects but not as much as its cousin.  It ends with a girl going, \\"Mmm, that was fantastic!\\"  Which it was.<br />\\"Rockit Miss USA\\" has imitated effects of Dirty Harry, \\"Go ahead, make my day\\", someone saying \\"Get away from the gun!\\" and a black guy asking subway shooter Bernard Goetz for $5.00.  There's a constant anti-gun theme going on here and a Cold War one as well.  On one occasion one hears \\"Reagan rocks my baby\\"  another time, \\"Moscow rocks my baby.\\"<br />\\"21st Century Boy\\" opens with Bach's Fugue before a computerized voice announces:  \\"From the 21st century, we present the next generation of rock and roll, starring... [the names of the band members]\\"  and a technobeat rivalling \\"Love Missile\\".  Much of the lyrics are a description what would be seen in the future, \\"satellite TV, laser beams, Chinese-speaking split-TVs,..etc.\\" The term \\"Elvis 1990\\" accurately describes the sound.  \\"I am the ultimate product\\" is what Sputnik would be for the music of their world.<br />\\"Massive Retaliation\\" samples a bit from Beethoven's Fifth.\\"  the repeated refrain \\"Shut up\\"  a booming drum beat, and words that don't add up to any kind of theme:  \\"Stimulation, baby/inspiration, baby\\" finishing up with \\"Moscow hit back\\" or \\"Bangkok hit back.\\"  Nothing about nuclear war here.<br />By the last two songs, the same crazy sound is there, which is fine, except that there's nothing unique to pick out.<br />Oh, inbetween each song are paid commercials for certain products, such as Tempo Magazine, Network 21, Studio Line of Loreal, the Sputnik Corporation.  They're brief snippets, but add to the feeling of music and technology for the 21st century.<br />I envision a metropolis embodying concepts from Blade-Runner or William Gibson with this kind of music.  17 years after its release, it still rocks out.atellite TV, laser beams, Chinese-speaking split-TVs,..etc.\\" The term \\"Elvis 1990\\" accurately describes the sound.  \\"I am the ultimate product\\" is what Sputnik would be for the music of their world.<br />\\"Massive Retaliation\\" samples a bit from Beethoven's Fifth.\\"  the repeated refrain \\"Shut up\\"  a booming drum beat, and words that don't add up to any kind of theme:  \\"Stimulation, baby/inspiration, baby\\" finishing up with \\"Moscow hit back\\" or \\"Bangkok hit back.\\"  Nothing about nuclear war here.<br />By the last two songs, the same crazy sound is there, which is fine, except that there's nothing unique to pick out.<br />Oh, inbetween each song are paid commercials for certain products, such as Tempo Magazine, Network 21, Studio Line of Loreal, the Sputnik Corporation.

0393312836|5.0|This book was utterly amazing.  I admit I was a bit uneasy to read of the violent happenings that happen in the first two chapters.  I was not expecting such quick -paced situations.  But it keeps happening and I couldn't help but get intrigued with the whole thing.  My heart was beating the whole time.  Anthony Burgees paints such vivid pictures of what is happening I found myself wanting to stop and catch my breath.  This is deffinately not a book for those who have dainty lifestyles.  It is quite violent and disturbing...which are books I love!
B000069AUI|3.0|Im really at a loss for understanding the constant Radiohead comparisons that Coldpay garners.  Martin's melancholy tone and somewhat dismal lyrics are hardly grounds enough for associating the two groups. Musically,  their similarities end at the driving guitars, which for the most part have been lacking on the last several Radiohead albums, who rely more on quirky electronics rather than a full band...Moreover,  how can one compare Coldplay's pop/rock sensibilities with a group that has admittedly strived to make their music inaccessible to the general public? <br />Now with that out of the way,  A rush of blood to the head...<BR>Overall,  it's a good album that suffers some major lags and inconsistencies. It's an album that begs to be programmed rather than listened to from front to back. Songs like Politik  that are more rock driven fail to grab me and  they seem forced. While they are musically competent to pull them off, Coldplay \\"rocking\\" seems unauthentic. At the other end of the spectrum, songs like Amsterdam seem more genuine but are just boring. Martin's voice is gentle and pleasant,   but it is not enough for me to listen to him whisper and moan through the same apologetic plea song after song. Coldplay is at their best when they create that late 80s U2 vibe, of sensible pop rock in songs like In My Place, Clocks and A Warning Sign.<br />This album has a solid six tracks,  3 stars.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Every reveiw seems to mention Joy Division. I want to say that allthough the singer certainly has a resembelance to Ian Curtis, the music itself is allmost nothing like Joy Division.<BR>Interpol are closer to say the Chameleons UK or even Faith era Cure, squezed into tight song structures.<BR>The best thing to say about this record is that I can listen to it over and over, and never skip a track.  Every single song is great, and none are filler.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Doug Liman has crafted an immensly watchable spy thriller with The Bourne Identity. If you're a fan of the book, unlearn what you have learned and enjoy the movie for what it is. Matt Damon shows us again that he is a gifted actor in giving the character of Jason Bourne a life that other actors may have just sleepwalked through. It must truly stink waking up one day and not know who you are. But to find that you can kick the stuffing out of two armed cops without breaking a sweat? That must be simply disturbing and Damon pulls it off without seeming to break a sweat himself.<br />And let us not forget outstanding supporting work from Franke Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and the always dependable Brian Cox. These guys elevate this movie from what would have been an entertaining action flick into a great action flick. <br />The DVD is... okay, I guess. It's always nice to see some deleted scenes. The alternate ending isn't as alternate as it could have been (same result, different type of execution). The making of featurette is just that, a bit of a fluff piece that touches on some stuff, but never really goes deeper. The commentary by Liman is nice and imformative. He answers some stuff you may have been thinking about, like why is Julia Stiles in such a small role in the movie (when they were actually shooting the movie, she wasn't quite a name yet).<br />Not exactly the best in the special features department, but the movie looks and sounds great. That added to the fact that it is simply an extremely cool movie makes it a must buy on DVD.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie was funny.  I LOVED it's dorkiness and it's puns.  I laughed throughout the entire thing.  Celebrites show up left and right.  And to see stars like David Bowie (Mmm...sexy) being quirky is amazing.  If you love stupid-humor or if you just want to laugh watch this fantastic movie.
B0000524E5|5.0|COYOTE UGLY is the story of a small town young lady trying to make her way in the world, and see her dreams come true. Violet is a young woman who is an aspiring songwriter. She has a fear of stage and would rather be in the dark, writing songs for other people. Upon moving to New York and leaving her father and best friend behind, she meets Kevin, who she is led to believe is in charge of music at this bar she visits. She gives him her demo tape, and realizes she was shammed. She also realizes the tough competition surrounding the music industry. Many doors get slammed in her face and her optomism fades. She finds a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly, where women dance on the counter and its a fierce environment she must adjust to well. The movie follows her dreams, and a romance with Kevin. It's overall really touching movie many people will love, and all I can say is if you haven't seen it yet, buy or rent it ASAP, it's a wonderful movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|The story of No Doubt is similar to that of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Both groups started out doing VERY upbeat music and have progressed on to other styles.  Along the way they developed on their instruments and as songwriters. Of course, with this progression comes the inevitable cries of \\"They're not like they used to be.\\"  Well thank goodness for that, as both bands are making the best music of their careers.  Having only heard the \\"hits\\" from No Doubt in the past, I am simply reviewing \\"Rock Steady\\" as a single album, not as someone who listened to \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" 5 billion times and thus yearns for the \\"good old days.\\"  That said, \\"Rock Steady\\" is a sonic blast.  There's not a single dud track on the album and some real growth here.  It's great for Top 40 radio that singles with some substance, like \\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Underneath It All\\" can be monster hits, as they introduce reggae and its various forms to young, impressionable listeners.  With the variety of producers on this album, one might think that the album would be disjointed, but it flows like a bouncing wave.  As great as the hits are, the song that totally gets the head bobbing (so much so that my chiropractor is getting rich), is the title track.  Adrian Young deserves major credit for his flawless drumming on this song, as it ends the CD on just the right note, as you reach for the button to play it all over again.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I really enjoyed this album a lot. Nora Jones has a beautiful, unique voice that is very soulfull and mature. The lyrics of her songs are also very powerful. I like to listen to her CD whenever I'm trying to relax because the music is somewhat slow but soothing. She has definitely become my new favorite singer. I'd recommend this album to anyone.
B000002H70|5.0|this album i see is masterpiece into our disintegration. in such songs as homesick,untitled,last dance and plainsong reaches our inner thoughts about our love. this album brings love too level all human beings see once in our life. this album makes feel like there is someone in our lives that see the way we do. the album makes realize who we are and in which we love. the album represents the down side of love which no other album can represnt
B000006O7C|5.0|I can't think of any other artist who made such a large impression with one studio album.  This is Jeff's unfinished business, and although I am a big fan, (along with Grace I own several live albums and his live DVD) I avoided this album thinking this an album consisting of semi-songs that the manager of Jeff's estate had to scrape the bottom of the barrell to put together.  Luckily, this is not the case.  This is an amazing album, running from folk, to rock, to psychedellia.  All of it is very interesting to me, and it just makes me miss him even more.  Absolutely essential for any Jeff Buckley fan.
0151008116|4.0|i bought this book from the reviews on this site i thought the first 90 pages were at times a little dry to get mostly the parts dealing with his journeys through spiritual enlightenment but the descriptions about zoo life leading up to the big journey on the boat which end up with pi being on a life boat with a zebra,hyena,and a tiger.I found really amazing what you might eat when confronted with hunger mainly in reference to the tiger which you will reconize if you read this book.<BR>  Did find a little bit a little hokey ( unbeliveable ) concerning the island but it is fiction and you need a little imagination all in all good book and was glad i read it and would recommend to others

B00005JKNF|4.0|Excise the murder mystery and there's a really great story here about how people treat one another, regardless of class or station. There's also a nice contrast between British reserve and American directness. Yet, Hollywood needed a hook, and that's where the classic \\"well-dressed dinner guests gathered around a body, wondering who could have done it\\" device comes in. To Altman's credit, he wisely spends as little time as possible on the actual murder and gives the inspectors who show up hardly any screen time. Good thing, since the real treat here comes in keeping track of all the uniformly wonderful performances, bedroom shenanigans, betrayals, alliances and nasty infighting. As a class warfare piece, it pales next to Renoir's classic Rules of the Game. But Gosford Park manages to make its points without overstating them, and while a tad overlong, it holds together nicely at the end.
0679731725|4.0|...why on earth a reader thinks this has anything to do with Japan or Japanese culture is beyond me. If the author did not have a Japanese name, that would never be said. Ishiguro has lived in the UK all his life, and was raised there from the age of five. There is not one word about Japan or Japanese culture in the entire novel. <br />This is a wonderful - and thoroughly English - book about the distortions of memory, the burdens and joys of duty, and about love and lost opportunity.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Hardly, I say. So allow me to go off relavance here and comment. While I have no problem with other people's opoions and such conpareing \\"binural\\" to dark side of the moon is some what off. Dark side of the moon was one of those albums that only comes once in a great, great while. Altough the only song that even remotely resembles anything like dark side of the moon on this album would be \\"nothing as it seems\\" with it's very melodic atmospheric vibe to it, and one of if not thee best tunes on here or pearl jam has done in recent times. <br />How to decribe binaural? well as I have said in my list mainia at times very catchy and emotional like pearl jam have done with there five previous efforts, but at times sorry to say(whats not with a little critisizim?) emotionless and sterl(yes sterl) as possible. But well that could be a big factor considering the ages of pearl jam at the moment being in there late 30's pushing 40. Styles change and there music has certainly eveolved. Still there are a pretty good handfull of really great tunes here and some dud's in my opoion, while this review is and are meerly just opioins. The first six tunes in here are rather impressive such as \\"breakerfall\\" (hell of an opener) \\"gods' dice\\", \\"evacuation\\" (why such the ripping of this tune? I think it's one of the better ones on here) \\"light years\\" \\"nothing as it seems\\" and \\"thin air.\\" Any way the rest pretty much falls into the same formula with the exception of \\"of the girl\\" which erely reminds me in the beging of led zeppelin's \\"black mountain side.\\"
B00000JGHM|5.0|In 1989 television had a popular series of Cops and Robbers entitled L.A. TAKEDOWN which was the inspiration for Michael Mann's epic 1995 film HEAT. L.A. Cop Vincent Hanna (Pacino) traces a series of thefts and murder cases lead by mastermind Neil Macaulay (DeNiro) and his crew. The trouble is their talents are just as equal. Makes perfect sense as the acting styles portrayed by Pacino and DeNiro together and all other films in the past are also unmatched in excellence. Seeing them together on screen for the first time in many years is as electrifying as seeing them years ago whether it was THE GODFATHERS, THE UNTOUCHABLES, you name it! I've never been much of a fan of Mafia Gangster movies which I've seen Pacino and DeNiro in from the past, but this film is definitely the highlight of their careers!<br />What also makes the story work so well is it is realistic. Pacino is nearly estranged from his wife, a third marriage, as his duties keep him away from family matters. His wife Justine (Diane Venora) frustrated tries to resolve, but attempts are unsuccessful. As Neil Macaulay, DeNiro gives us a very different villain. He is not a Mafia Gangster in the Al Capone style. He is not a villain portrayed from Dirty Harry or Lethal Weapon films. He is simply an ordinary man with assignments to do. Unfortunately the assignments get him into trouble every step of the way. He has only two choices - withdraw or be killed - all on the duty and on one job. He later meets an attractive young library worker (Amy Brenneman), and lies to her that he's a salesman. When she later discovers his true identity, the heat is coming around the corner again. What choices does he have? Dump her or tell her the truth that he can't see her ever again. You can actually feel the intense emotions which both Pacino and DeNiro go through together. Thus HEAT provides something very different. The audience comes to terms and understands the villains of the story. As such, we find ourselves not wantingto see them killed off.<br />Several critics have complained of overlength, which is true as the film is a little long. The overlength is good in this case, as it better explains the events as they unfold. HEAT is a more than an action film. It's about relations, about friendship, about trust and loyalty, about treachery, about revenge, about commitments, and about reality.<br />Very memorable performances as well from Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo as DeNiro's henchman. With them the same situations apply. They, in a sense, are simply men on duty, when things go amiss, what choices do they have then to kill or be killed? It is demonstrated very cleverly when one of DeNiro's crew jumps the gun and kills a cop, causing the whole heist to go awry. One more problem for DeNiro to deal with - to not be snitched.<br />Here is a real curiosity, Tom Sizemore plays a character named Michael, and my name is Michael. Plus Tom Sizemore and I both share the same Birthday - September 29!<br />Unforgettable classic classic classic film....BUY IT! DVD disappointingly doesn't contain much extras though, except all the trailers. Would have loved a commentary. Still an awesome movie though. Actions films just don't get any better than this!

B00008DDXL|5.0|This movie rocked. Much better than the first. Granted, the story line IS a little dull in comparison to the first movie and the second book, but the 'Wizard Duel' between Harry and Malfoy definitely is worth seeing, as well as the 'Quidditch match.'<br />The acting is great, (only one I didn't like was the gardener).<br />If you're a Harry Potter fan, you HAVE to add this to your collection. If not, buy it and you'll become one, guaranteed.
B000002ADT|5.0|so it is pointless to write a review for this since so many have recommended it and if you are not buying it you are crazy.  i just wanted to lend a little of my own personal relationship with the album.  i am a classical man, a classical person.  i love shostakovitch, i love beethoven's last sonata, stuff like that; weird string quartet's, arvo part, etc, mozart.  there are what they call 'classical snobs' and also 'jazz snobs' and both won't listen to their respective other, the infamous other, and they treat it as a garlic:vampire ratio.  but i bought this album, three, four years ago, maybe more.  so honestly i still cant deal with big band, i cant stand swing or glenn miller crud or basie or even davis' other stuff or monk or so many things and jazz is often repellent to my ears and i am still a majority classical person, i suppose.  but that can happen in any way, not just jazz...and this album has helped me to realize that, as many things help one to realize...'ive hated this all along...why?,' you think, you think that you know something...it is the whole dogmatical approach, it lends itself to an epiphany of the other side...,how can it not? for there are no certain sides, one must always choose the middle, the golden mean, else such an epiphany is inevitable...perhaps that was little off topic, perhaps not...but this album, as corny as it sounds, it transcends...it transcends in the same way that im sure, hopefully, some classical pieces will help jazz-snobs to pass over.  it' not like, well, for example, getz/gilberto(which is still decent) or something like that.  it is it's own.  im not saying its the only album that is it's own, and im certainly not saying its the only album that has affected me in a certain way, but...well read into it what you will.  it's amazing.  i sit and listen and listen and listen for hours, as only something like schubert's D960 sonata or beethoven's apassionata could make me do before...and every single time i get goosebumps,and i say oh dont stop keep going and it gets to flamenco sketches, my favorite, and im just so happy so so happy, and i say over and over dont stop and when miles plays that last muted note, so sudden, too sudden, oh it's agony, such beautiful, nasty agony, but if i have my girlfriend it is one of the best feelings that i have had in this simple life, no matter how simple that may sound.  it's the kind of album that, if you're a former classical snob you'll buy a million more jazz albums thinking 'hey! jazz is a goldmine of....of gold!'  but you'll search and you'll search and you'll never find anything close, not even close.  if you do find something close, please tell me.
B000063DFQ|4.0|\\"Piece Of Mind\\" is a wonderful Maiden album filled with good music! Such songs as \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", and \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" are well-known and classics. But such gems as \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Quest For Fire\\" are lesser known yet still as awesome. Bruce Dickinson sounds really great here, especially on \\"Revelations\\" where he just wails. This album was the start of the classic line-up, which would follow for many years. Adrian Smith's solo on \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" is just awesome. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it gets a little slow later in the album. This album is very good and is very recommended. It's heavy metal essential and a rock classic.
B000069HK2|1.0|Oh man, where to begin???  I was so disgusted by this album I couldn't get past track 5!!!  I love punk music & whatnot, but this album stunk so bad.  They sound like Stabbing Westward wannabes with no direction at all.. who scream more than they actually harmonize.  I'm not fond of someone who can't carry a tune screaming instead, because in that case he's like nasty, can't understand when to give it up,....  If you like punk/alternative/rock/heavy metal you're like millions of the rest of us, but The Used isn't one I'd ever recommend (unlike you enjoy having your eardrums blasted by amateurish screaming & guitar playing).

B00005JKZT|5.0|I love this movie. It's much better than the Fellowship of the Ring. There's more action and more drama. One thing I didn't like about this movie is that it didn't follow the book The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers very well. In the book, Frodo, Sam and Gollum never go to Osgilath and Faramir never even thinks about taking the Ring. He actually says something like, \\"Don't worry Frodo, I'm not going to try to take the Ring from you like my brother.\\" But for a movie, it was excellent! I can't wait until the Return of the King! (\\"Return of the King\\" is my favourite book. I wonder how it will appear on screen!)

B00003CXXM|3.0|That is, read the book instead if you want to read what Robert Ludlum meant &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; to be. See this film if you want a spy thriller with a basic similarity to the novel.  See the Richard Chamberlain mini-series if you want to see a good adaptation of Ludlum's book. <BR>  If you watch the special features on the DVD, you get a pretty good glimpse of the evident ego of the director, which gives pretty good clues as to why this film bears so little resemblance to the book.

B0000047CW|3.0|Getz and Byrd, what more needs to be said. Although these two did not care much for each other much on a personal level. They have created, in this album the start of GREAT bossa nova music. Acually, I am listening to this piece as I write this review. If you do not have it, you are missing out on a beautiful gig.
B000002MFN|4.0|This album came out in 1992 when Madonna had lots and lots of scandals which overwhelmed her musical work. But to be true this isn't something really great. It has more hip HOp sounds and disco sounds but in this case Madonna tries to be nothing but scandalous so it starts getting boring very soon.<BR>Erotica: I like this Hip Hop song. It'S very atmospheric.<BR>Fever: That'S dancefloor. I like it.<BR>Bye bye baby .She leaves a bad lover. Funny but like most of the songs it starts getting boring,.<br />Deeper and deeper .Another Dancefloor song. Reminds me of \\"Vogue\\".<BR>Where life begins: The song about oral sex. It'S scandalous but nothing else.<BR>Bad girl: This song is about being afraid to show your feelings. Really good.<BR>Waiting: From the half spoken half sung tracks the best ( with \\"Erotica\\").<BR>Thief of hearts: Again dancefloor: It'S about a woman who always tries to steal Madonna'S lovers: It'S just wicked.<BR>Words: I don't like it.<BR>Rain: I think this is one of her best ballads. Versy atmospheric.<BR>Why'S it so hard: The lyrics are well written but I don't like the song.<BR>In this life :This song is about Aids. Madonna had a few friends who suffered from it .But I also don't like this song. It'S boring.<BR>Did you do it :We have just two rapper and the Chorus from \\"Waiting\\" I heard that it has a very candalous text. I think it'S rather boring (again)<BR>Secret garden :Reminds me of \\"Where life begins\\"
B000001ELP|5.0|KISS, MUSIC FROM \\"THE ELDER\\" is a great KISS album. I accept the fact KISS was trying something differet but they didn't have to change there image. When KISS was recording this album they knew something was wrong cause Peter Criss already left the band and Ace was on the verge of leaving. Then agian Eric Carr is a better drummer than Peter Criss though. I did like the music on this album but I didn't care about the story. I didn't know what the story was about. Aleast they didn't do another disco song.
B000066C87|2.0|what a major disappointment. Not very hard to figure out 'who done it'. What's harder is figuring out why they spent ALL this time on it.<br />Great cast. Fair acting (actually no acting ability was really necessary as there was no depth to any character, let alone the whole plot).<br />Patiently waited for things to develop...and waited...and waited &, yet again, waited. Finally about 2/3s of the way through a murder took place. Wasted a lot of precious time hoping for better.<br />Want a tip? Don't waste YOUR time.
B000001ELR|5.0|KISS, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT is the only Heavy Metal KISS has came close of doing a heavy metal album. Anything after Creatures was Pop-metal until they did REVENAGE and they was heavy. I did like the fact Ace wasn't on this album and I don't like Vinnie Vincent's guitar playing. Vinnie Vincent is a rip off and a low rate version of Randy Rhoades. I did like the fact that this album heavy.
B000001Y5J|4.0|Broken is the second NIN cd I purchased following the dark masterpiece that is \\"The Downward Spiral\\". It is 33+ minutes of raw torment and carnage all twisted and tied up into a bondage of an EP. The emotions of Halo 5 are genuine and pure, inspired by Reznor's feud and hatred with TVT records. Each song is capable of representing sheer power and strength in sound while the instrumental tracks provide some peaceful yet depressing insights in between periods of onslaught and rage. The two bonus tracks are interesting but lacks some character and focus of the first six.<br />Standout Tracks: Happiness in Slavery & Gave Up<BR>As each song procedes the previous, the adrenaline and intensity is heightened. Thus, the last two tracks [excluding the bonus material] represent the climax of Broken. Combining heavy guitar riffs with loud, innovative synths; surprisingly enough, Happiness in Slavery comes off extremely catchy. Gave Up is my favorite track on this CD. With its hopeless lyrics and distortion, it certainly leaves the listener on a high note. Gave Up also appeals to me as a faster version of Wish. As Reznor screams through the chorus, he sounds like a racing demon on speed. <br />     Broken is the next step up from the phenomenal debut \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". It is anything but a \\"placeholder\\" described by Genevieve Williams. The song \\"Wish\\" won Reznor a Grammy and it elevated NIN's popularity. My only complaint about \\"Broken\\" is its length, as it leaves the audience with a bit of emptyness. However, having a full album of hate anthems might bring this precious gem to a bore real fast...<br />- aZnXgIn
B000002BE9|5.0|I initially wanted to get this CD so i could hear &quot;Criminal&quot; (her first single) and hear &quot;shadowboxer&quot; and &quot;sleep to dream&quot; that are sometimes played on the radio.  But after simply one listen all the way through, I learned that every single song on this album is artfully crafted containing beautiful lyrics, perfect instrumentation and performance and Fiona's beautful voice filled with raw emotion.  <BR>This is good music. Every single song is timeless, especialy &quot;never is a promise&quot; &quot;shadowboxer&quot; &quot;carrion&quot; &quot;pale september&quot; &quot;first taste&quot; and &quot;smooth like honey&quot; in addition to the very popular single: &quot;criminal&quot; <BR>The songs have elements of blues, jazz, and pop. Some are very upbeat (first taste), others are very dramatic and slow, but every note will be pleasing to the ears. No annoying choruses, just true music. In Sullen Girl, a stanza is repeated numerous times, but each time Fiona's voice changes, rises and falls like a wave. It sounds different every time. <BR>This is a CD to have forever, will never get old, and the songs will always sound fresh and soulful.  Fiona Apple is a genius.
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi opens with stately, wide-angle shots of mesa fields and clouds.  The world they depict is vast, uninhabited, almost unearthly.  This continues for about a quarter of the movie's length, lulling you into a pastoral reverie.  Then suddenly the Philip Glass score becomes more insistent and earthmovers loom up from out of nowhere.  Man has arrived, and he's up to no good.  What began as ode to unspoiled nature becomes eerie urban dystopia, a montage of slums, factories, and city streets through which hordes of people scuttle in speeded-up motion.  (Is \\"koyaanisqatsi\\" also the Hopi word for \\"time-lapse photography\\"?)  In the final sequence a rocket roars off the launch pad only to explode in mid-air, and the camera follows a burning engine as it tumbles Icarus-like back to earth.  Then, just in case we've somehow missed the point, the title of the film appears on a black background along with its translation: \\"a way of life that calls for another way of living\\".<br />The great thing is, it's entirely possible to miss the point.  Director Godfrey Reggio is too inspired a cinematographer for his own good.  The sumptuousness of his images keeps undercutting the film's ham-fisted man-as-spoiler message and replacing it with something subtler and more humane.  Though the opening landscape shots are beautiful in a National Geographic sort of way, the movie only gets going after it moves into the city.  The most distinctive part of Koyaanisqatsi is its time-lapse footage of man-made environments: images of headlights racing down freeways, office building windows blinking on and off, and crowds streaming through Grand Central Station.  In the last of these, it seems that all this speed is supposed to be dehumanizing, to make people look like insects, but instead the bustle is jittery and comic, like an old silent film.  Crowds that might have been anonymous if filmed at normal speed become individuated as your eye is drawn around, frantically making note of all thefaces, gaits, and endearingly bad late-seventies hairstyles.  You're literally people watching, and the effect is a humanist one, warm and oddly touching.<br />There's a similar happy misstep in the depiction of technology.  Roughly speaking, progress is this bad guy in Reggio's world, with the role of progress played by cities.  (As opposed to pristine mesa fields and cloudscapes.)  Unfortunately for Reggio, urban settings are stubbornly cinematic.  Try to make a beautiful movie about an ugly city and you'll end up making your city look beautiful.  (Blade Runner and Metropolis had the same problem.)  Though Koyaanisqatsi's official position is a sort of anti-technological moralism, Reggio (like so many moralizers) ends up making the thing he condemns more compelling than the thing he praises.  Sprawl has never looked so appealing.  Even a side trip into a processed cheese factory is less a swipe at consumer society than a welcome bit of comic relief.  Reggio's cityscapes are so strange and vibrant that it seems worth paving over a little nature to have built them.  Koyaanisqatsi may have been conceived as an ecological warning, but it ends up being a love letter to skyscrapers.
B00006AG5N|2.0|The music is great, it's what's been done to it I take issue with. All the latest technology has been used to \\"improve\\" the original tapes. Unfortunately they've been digitized, remixed and doused in noise reduction. So, now it all sounds sanitized, sterile and has been rendered inert and lifeless. \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" is yet another attempt to \\"modernize\\" Elvis. The first time was on the early '80's release \\"I Was The One\\" where some of his greatest rockabilly performances were defaced by modern overdubs to make them sound \\"contemporary\\". I don't want Elvis transported to the 21st century. When I listen to Elvis I want to be transported to '56-7 or '60 or '69. If you want good sounding Elvis, try to track down DCC's \\"24 Karat Hits\\". No \\"modern\\" studio trickery, just good old fashioned tube mojo.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is such a great CD.  Norah Jones doesn't have the aged appearance of someone who could sing lyrics so beautifully, yet she does with wonderful grace.  The sweeping tunes really stirred me.  Definitely a must for your CD collection!!
6304779356|5.0|The Lost Boys shows me something different every time I watch it.  Perhaps I was oblivipus my first time out, perhaps TNT cut portions, or perhaps it really is that myriad.<BR>There is so much that can be said about detail in this film, tiny little cues that spin your perception of the story in wholly different directions than it has ever gone before.<BR>The elated grin on Star's face as she presses against David in the race scene, the tiny scrap of Beauty Has Her Way as the black clad vampire leader watches her return to him, and even the Echo and the Bunnymen poster on Sam's wall (not to mentions millions of other tiny details) all aid in a new sense of scope as slowly you take them in.<br />What's more, there are the upper, superficial layers of the film to revel in.  Just sit back and relax while the abject sillyness of the Coreys makes your gut hurt with suppressed laughter, enjoy the (apparent) absolute mindlessness of the fight scene, and try not to be nauseated during the feeding(unrealistic? yes.  evocative of more gory images?  also yes.)<br />The last (I swear, the last) comment I absolutely must make follows:<BR>The Lost Boys is an incredibly easy movie to feel.  Not that it is emotionally trying in any real way, bt in that there is something more than tangible, perhaps even more than visceral about the film.  The plot is believable, not in that I believe in the supernatural, but that in many (if not all:  note the Frog brothers) of the characters respond to stimuli presented in such an absolutely honest way that it worries one.  Are there vampires right down the block?  The howling motorcycles, the missing persons flyers, the predominance of odd people in my neighbourhood - am I living in an haven for the undead?  Even the most rational people could easily find themselves looking over their shoulders when walking the dog after dark.  Especially people who live as close to Greenwich Village as I do, pardon the phrasing but that place must be crawling with vamps!

B0000666DW|5.0|It just did not get any better than this in 2002. I listen to a wide variety of music and buy a lot of CDs in a year, and nothing that I bought or heard in 2002 can stand up to this. Mastodon is the new standard. These guys are from Atlanta, where I live, so I have been lucky enough to see them live three times in tiny clubs. Everything the other reviewers here have been saying about the drummer Brian is true, which is even more apparent when you see him play live. I have a friend who knows the band, and I was told that the drummer laid down all of the tracks for this entire record in one take! When you hear this record, you will find that hard to believe, but it was told to me as fact.<br />As much as I love the drumming and amazing guitar playing, the bassist/singer is my favorite part of the band. I just love the way he uses a very percussive, punctuating singing style that adds to the brutality of the music. Also, as the \\"frontman\\" of the band, he is a blast to watch live.<br />If I had to come up with a musical comparison to make, I would say that it's clear to me that these guys have listened to a lot of 90's Death. By that I mean the band Death, not the metal sub-genre. You can really hear the combination of technicality, brutality, fluidity, amazing drumming, and amazing guitar playing achieved on Death albums such as Human, Individual Thought Patterns, and The Sound of Perserverance on Mastodon's Remission and Lifeblood. A comparison to Death, though, only tells part of the story. Death has a kind of stiffness and formality that Mastodon does not. Mastodon, with all of its technical brilliance, has more of a sense spontaneity, looseness, and most of all swagger.
0151008116|3.0|At first I was mildly disappointed, because I thought it was a children's book, and that's pretty much all I can read. Especially pop-ups. But as I read on, I found this story of a boy, his tiger and a boat to resemble an experience I had with Mr. Bubbles. Except replace tiger with drunken iguana, boat with the Key West HoJo's, and boy with Village Person....but I digress. Very enjoyable!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first got into John Mayer after a friend and I were comparing artists we liked and she likened his sound to Dave, Jack Johnson, and Dispatch, all of whom I love. That was before No such thing became such a big hit, and I decided to buy this album, and his first one as well, and let me just say, I have not once regretted that decision. John has an unbelievable gift for music and songwriting that really shows in songs like Your body is a wonderland, No such thing, My stupid mouth, and Comfortable (from his first album). If you have an appreciation for music that is artistic and meaningful and expressive, then go for John Mayer's first two CD's. You will NOT, repeat NOT, be disappointed. I recently heard (I believe from Billboard) that John is working on a new album due sometime this spring, and if he continues to keep up the great work he's already begun, this man will be as huge as Dave in a few years. HIGHLY recommended!

0316666343|3.0|Sebold's writing is not particularly elegant or beautiful, but its definitely good and solid. What's notable about this book is the story and how it's told-its unique and somewhat surreal perspective and its nostalgic voice. An easy, pleasurable read by all accounts, but definitely overrated; it's not one that will be considered a &quot;classic&quot; in years to come.
B000001GQB|5.0|This is the advertising motto of Deutsche Grammophon, and it is true for this album.  I have never heard such beautiful recordings of the best symphonies ever written. (my humble opinion ;) )  In addition to the music, the jacket contains interesting information on the composer.  It seems he was kind of an anal retentive jerk, but I guess it paid off.  This is truly a masterpiece, and worth every penny Amazon is asking for it.  If you like these Mozart symphonies, take a look at Philips' recordings of 'The Great' piano concertos.  I would venture to say that they are a tad better than these symphonies...
B000002TYX|5.0|If Ken Burns compiled CDs instead of making documentaries, he'd probably have made the Beatles' &quot;Anthology 1&quot;. Listening to it feels like a documentary, minus the video. It's even got interview and sound bites segueing in-between the songs on Disc 1. Unlike the other Anthologies, you're given more cover songs and less alternate versions of Beatles favorites. Still, the covers are fun to listen to and the alternates that we are given are worth it. And, unlike a lot of other listeners, I really liked &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;. Also worth noting are the live songs, including their immortal performance of &quot;All My Loving&quot; on the Ed Sullivan show, complete with screaming girls. Listening to the alternates and false starts is an experience. It's funny to listen to the Beatles miss cues, try different time signatures and solos, as well as critisize each other. It proves that the Beatles are human after all.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie put both James Cameron and Schwarzenegger on the map back in 1984.When the movie starts,it's the year 2029 where the city of LA is basically rubble and machines/super-computers run the show in the future.Expect the fact that some humans survivers and they weren't giving up without a fight and they're led by a man named John Connor.The computers are hell-bent on exterminating the humanrace for good and the only way the computers can destory man's future is by changing the past.So they send an indestructible cyborg called the terminator(Schwarzenegger)back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)whose unborn son will become mankind's only hope.But the Human Ressitance sent a soldier named Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn)to protect Sarah and her unborn child.The Terminator is one wild and great ride to take.The acting is great,the score is really cool,the images of the future are creepy to see and great screenplay and directing by Cameron makes The Terminator a classic adventure film to watch over and over again.The DVD is loaded with special features like a brand-new \\"Other Voices\\"Documentary with new James Cameron interviews,\\"The Terminator:A Retrospective\\"Documentary,terminated/deleted scenes,trailer,TV spots and more.The Terminator is a must have in your DVD collection.
0380778556|5.0|While the red 'satin' cover and the category of 'Romance Thriller' seem to be defining characters for Rebecca, it most certainly is not.<br />The story starts with our unnamed the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II, and Mr. Maxim de Winter, a widower of eight months following the tragic drowning of his wife Rebecca. The-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II is a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, a fat woman more inquisitive and annoying than humanely possible. One day, the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II is free from lunch duty since Mrs. Van Hopper is sick, and meets de Winter at lunch, and accepts his invitation to a ride in his car. So starts their friendship, until the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II realizes that she is in love with him, her, a just out of school young thing, with a forty-two year old widower. So she is as surprised as Mrs. Van Hopper when he proposes to her right before she leaves; stunned, she says yes.<br /><br />She reaches Manderly, where her fantasyland quickly vanishes. From Mrs. Danvers, the sinister and loyal maid to Rebecca, to Rebecca herself, who seems to haunt the house with her presence, nothing is what it seems. Soon, Mrs. De Winter II finds herself looking for the answers behind the former mistress of the house.<br />This is a brilliantly written book; however, the second half, following the scene in Rebecca's old rooms with Mrs. Danvers, goes by much faster, as the plot speeds towards the climax. This book is genuinely frightening at time; I myself stopped reading in the night because I was getting the chills. For those of you who are not looking for a sappy love story, this book is definitly a must-read.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This is soft relaxing music which is hard to find anymore. The background is great, not the synthetic loud beat or swish of drums that cover for the lack of talent of the vocalist. Listen for the nuance, the little delights. For those who are bored, maybe you should learn to relax without stimulation all the time, this gives one a different perspective and maybe even a little less desire to be so critical of a truely talented musician.

I read the book, not as a manual on dealing with death, but as an interesting story of friends and their impending loss.<BR>I found that Mitch picked up on some interesting points as well as some minor ones that many of us would miss. Mitch kept bringing Morrie food even when Morrie wasn't eating much. We all try to continue to act how we wish it would be or hoped it could be. We try to make things remain as normal as possible and it is hard to adjust to the change especially when we know we are going to lose someone.<BR>Pick this book up because it is a good read. <BR>I also would recommend, Healing Stories of Grief and Faith, From Denial and Despair to Comfort and Peace to those experiencing grief.
0385484518|5.0|One reviewer used the redundant term \\"banal platitudes\\" in reference to this book.  He may be right, but there's a funny thing about platitudes...they're all true!  Mitch already knew in his heart the wisdom behind Morrie's words before he spoke them and so do all of us.  That doesn't mean we don't need to be reminded.  I think the attitude that this book isn't worth the couple hours it takes to read is the consummate endorsement of everything Morrie was trying to say.  Slow down.  Think about it.  Dying is one the most important things we'll ever do, yet it is a very simple thing that is not diminished by simple words.  Too many people that read the great philosophers are sucked into the pretense that only great thoughts born of the greatest minds can solve life's riddles.  Some things are just not that complicated...or at least they needn't be.<br />If you've had the experience - both a misfortune and a life-changing blessing - of watching a loved one die from a wasting disease like ALS or cancer, this book will touch you.  I've been there and can assure you Albom describes the scene perfectly.<br />It's a quick read and very well-written.  If you're young and still immortal, I doubt it will mean much to you.  I'm not thirty yet, but I lost my immortality when my dad passed on a few years ago.  It's time for me to start thinking about death every once in a while.  I have a lot of living yet to do and as Morrie says, \\"You have to learn how to die to learn how to live.\\"

B00006IUNN|3.0|There were two big budget war films of 2002--WINDTALKERS and WE WERE SOLDIERS.  The latter was unquestionably the finer of the two even though both had similar action sequences.  What differentiates them was the presence and careful development of the theme of soldierly solidarity that was present in WE WERE SOLDIERS.  Director John Woo stamps WINDTALKERS with his trademark over the top battle sequences of explosions, bullets flying, and bodies leaping.  Nicholas Cage is Sergeant Enders, a man who is scarred mentally and physically even before the main action of the film begins.  He alone has survived while his full platoon had been killed by the Japanese during World War II.  He carries what he believes to be the scarlet letter of guilt on his burned ears and within his soul which requires frequent sake to soothe over if only for the moment.  There is the hint of a romance with a navy nurse that intrudes in rather than enlarges upon his daily struggle to find equanimity.  Of far more interest is his relation with a Navajo marine (Adam Beach)who is a 'codetalker,' one who speaks in a cryptic variation of his native Navaho tongue to confound eavesdropping English-speaking radio listeners.  Enders and his Navajo share more than a buddy relation.  As if Enders has not enough guilt to carry, he is ordered to shoot the Navajo if the Japanese are likely to take him prisoner and have the opportunity to torture him to learn the code.  It is precisely here that WINDTALKERS goes seriously astray.  Why would the top brass go to the trouble of training valuable codebreakers only to expose them at every chance to possible death or capture?  Further, there are several scenes in which the Navajos use the code in situations that do not require code.  In fact, had plain English been used in those situations, it is arguable that fewer American casualties would have resulted.  What director Woo gives the viewer is a slam-bang action war film that delivers a high body count but a low level of logic.  The insanity and illogic of actual war need not be replicated in movies about war.  In this case, it was.

B000068TSI|5.0|WE WERE SOLDIERS is one of the most significant war movies of this or any other era. Director Randall Wallace tells the tale of the Seventh Cavalry (Custer's Cavalry) as it fought a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army in a battle that meant nothing in a tactical sense in the Vietnam of 1964.  There are two perspectives.  One is from an American colonel played by Mel Gibson while the other is from his adversary, a Vietcong colonel played straight by Don Duong, without the bucktoothed screechiness of a former generation's Asian army commander. Despite the different uniforms and political philosophies of both Duong and Gibson, they are more alike than each would probably care to admit.  Both are dedicated and experienced leaders of men and neither is willing to allow personal feelings to get in the way of the killing business that is war.  <br />WE WERE SOLDIERS is seemingly no more than the tale of a regiment of soldiers that covers first their training for battle, then later the battle itself.  But as in many war movies, the complexity of the war is only slowly brought into focus.  Director Wallace, in addition to showing the Vietnamese side through many vignettes that parallel the strategy sessions of the Americans also shows the wives and families of the soldiers.  Madeline Stowe is particularly effective as Gibson's wife who knows only all too well that the fortunes of war are sometimes reduced to the cliche of insensate luck as the determining factor in who comes home in one piece and who does not.  It is she who takes on the onerous burden of delivering the telegrams of death to the wives of her husband's soldiers.  The large cast includes a sterling performance by Sam Elliot, as an experienced sergeant-major who helps his men retain both life and sanity in the insanity of hand to hand combat. <br />What emerges as a subtext is the unsettling notion that in combat the enemy often differs more from us by the color of uniform worn than by anything else.  The extremely realistic scenes of bodies being ripped to pieces make the viewer care that some soldiers are being killed by some other soldiers, while not particularly caring about the colors of their uniforms.  The 'We' of WE WERE SOLDIERS is a sobering reminder that we should be glad that killing is so horrible, else we might grow overly fond of it.
B00005OAIE|1.0|When I first heard his songs on the radio, I thought he had a wonderful voice and great guitar playing to go along with it. So I made a huge mistake in buying this CD.

0393320928|5.0|This is being written in the evening after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. While all the would-be experts go onto Larry King and Good Morning America and try out for the Olympic Conclusion High Jump Team (while the real experts -- and I just got off the phone with one -- have a pretty good idea what it was, and turn down same interviews), right now, this is a good time for those who are interested to read the background of the previous Shuttle disaster. All of Part II, about 2/3 of this book, is titled &quot;Mr. Feynman goes to Washington: Investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster.&quot; Incredible, absolutely true, and only the tip of the iceberg, according to somebody who was there. There's a pattern to this sort of thing, a combination of hubris and unwillingness to face reality, and Feynman's book lays it bare like nothing else I can think of. The only other document that comes close in my mind (at least, as I recall the details) is the old &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon, showing a rope-and-tire swing over a tiny little pond. There's a big chunk of the tire missing, and a shark fin cruising around below. Two kids on the bank, one says to the other &quot;You go tell Billy's mom, and I'll go look for another tire.&quot; We've seen this before (Shuttle, Concorde), we'll see it again, but meanwhile Feynman's account is a must-read. You will not be disappointed.
B000002J1O|5.0|When I listen to \\"Firth of Fifth\\" or \\"The Cinema Show/Aisle of Plenty\\" I realise that, for me, there was never another band that managed to join such a line-up of gifted artists as Genesis did in this period. This album is probably their finest work.     Tony Banks plays here some of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard. Peter's interpretation of the lyrics is also perfect. They are both superb on \\"Firth of Fifth\\", my favourite Genesis song. Steve's guitar play on \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" is also one of the highlights of the album in my opinion.    Compared to the other songs, \\"More Fool Me\\" is clearly the only one not interesting. As for \\"I know what I like\\" I will always remember it as one of the music's that showed me the Genesis I like.    Everyone who enjoys instrumental rock and still don't own this album will have unique moments discovering it.

I think I have played several tracks over and over until I am going to buy another from wearing it out. \\" Numb\\" was one of the most soulful songs on the cd and you can tell that it was from the heart or personal which made it even better to me.

0767020308|4.0|A week or so back, I enjoyed the 1996 cinematic release of EMMA starring Gwyneth Paltrow. (I shall refer to this version as \\"E96\\".) An Austen-obsessive friend of mine said I MUST see this 1997 version (\\"E97\\") with Kate Beckinsale in the title role. So, unsolicited, she mailed me her own personal copy to view at my earliest convenience, which I interpreted as immediately. Sigh -  friendship's demands are a heavy load. However, since the storyline of E97 is pretty much like E96, I can provide the same synopsis.<br />Beckinsale plays Emma Woodhouse, who lives with her father at Hartfield, an example of the country manor house common to all Austen storylines. Having just engineered the marriage of her governess to a rich neighbor, the 21- year old Emma decides to take up match making as a career. After all, it's Regency England and there's not much for a genteel single lady to do to allay rural boredom. Drawing pints at the local pub to build up the college fund isn't an option. Anyway, most needful of assistance is best friend Harriet Smith (Samantha Morton), a respectable enough girl of dubious lineage for whom Emma has plans. Perhaps she can maneuver Harriet into marrying the vicar, Reverend Elton (Dominic Rowan), rather than the local hayseed whom she loves. Meddling in affairs of the heart is a sticky wicket, but someone has to do it, especially in the absence of a licensed yenta.<br />And what of Emma's own romantic prospects? There appear to be none in the virtual hail of misdirected cupid's arrows. True, Hatfield hosts the frequent visits of the 30-something Mr. Knightley (Mark Strong), a well-mannered and well-heeled bachelor from down the carriage road. But he's Emma's brother-in-law, a long standing relationship that seems to preclude anything of prurient interest. And he occasionally scolds Emma for her bratty behavior. Hmm, perhaps they're made for each other. You think?<br />I'm giving E97 the same number of stars, four, as I gave E96, and for the same reason, which is that the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999) are better in comparison.<br />The costuming, sets and props of this EMMA seemed more authentic than the previous, but that's an impression based on no expertise whatsoever. Perhaps it was the lighting, which, in E96, seemed more luminescent. And E97's screenplay did more to develop the nuances of the relationships between the various players, but not so much that it made any difference in my lackadaisical appreciation of Austen's works as a whole. Strong's Knightley was a more interesting character than Jeremy Northam's in E96. While the former was no less a gentleman than the latter, this Knightley had a more smoldering intensity. Some latent kinkiness, perhaps? Morton's Smith was more endearingly pathetic than Toni Collette's in the earlier rendering. And E97 links Emma's final happiness to some imaginary (or not?) chicken thieves. A nice touch, that.<br />The bottom line to my comparison has to be GP versus KB in the lead. The latter's Emma  took herself and her mission much more seriously, and verged on being annoyingly snooty in the process. Paltrow's Emma, on the other hand, had a blithely lighter touch. It's as if she was giving the audience a wink and an elbow's nudge. I would much rather spend an afternoon on the English heath with a picnic basket and GP's Emma than KB's. So, my vote as the film that deserves watching, if you can only see one, is E96.ason, which is that the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999) are better in comparison. <br />The costuming, sets and props of this EMMA seemed more authentic than the previous, but that's an impression based on no expertise whatsoever.

B000002UB6|5.0|There are some fabulous performances of great songs on this album, including<br />Two of Us: one of John and Paul's best-ever duets. Despite all that is said about Phil Spector's overproducing, Mark Lewisohn points out in the booklet accompanying the black boxed set of Beatles albums that it is his remixing that makes this song sound so crisp<br />Dig A Pony has some of John's most ambiguous, crazy lyrics and an interesting chord progression. Again, Spector's tinkering improves the song: the song sounds much better with Paul and George's original backing vocal intro/outro removed as we hear it here.<br />Across the Universe does sound over the top here, but it is a fabulous song: one of John's best. I prefer the version on the Past Masters album [originally from the World Wildlife Fund record, with bird sounds added.]<br />I Me Mine is a great Harrisong. It is a most unusual waltz, which John and Yoko dance to in the film. Again, Spector has improved the song by extending it, due to its shortness.<br />The One After 909 is another great Lennon/McCartney collaboration. It was an inspired idea to go back to one of their earliest compositions.<br />The Long and Winding Road has been spoiled by the overproduction, but when you listen to the version on the Anthology albums, you can hear that the original does need something.<br />For You Blue is a fun 12 bar blues song. I love the tack piano and John's slide guitar.<br />Recommended. Not the best Beatles album, but it does include many great songs.
B00006I9HJ|4.0|i love it when reviewers decide to roast an album without listening to it more than once. it really brings a tear to my eye and warmth to my soul. normally, it wouldn't be worth my while to actually post a review, but since this guy is so hell-bent on destroying a band who is so earnestly trying to sell the music they believe in, i feel inclined. <br />sure, you could listen to this album and decide that it's just alternative music - but when has nada surf decided NOT to make college rock? they've always been into making teenage fanclub-style material, and i think they do it well. their arrangements are substancially more broad, and they sound tighter than ever. matthew caws' ability to write both a sincere lyric (\\"paper boats\\", \\"inside of love\\") and a solid tune (\\"hi speed soul\\", \\"happy kid\\") make him a standout in the indie rock world. i respect his interest both his interest in a variety of music and his commitment to honesty - even when people on the internet decide that his lyrics are too simple, or that they weren't going to like his band just because they didn't like \\"popular\\". <br />if you plan on purchasing Let Go, buy the britsh version so you get \\"no quick fix\\", and lack \\"run\\" (this song really lessens the album as a whole). i think it was one of the top 10 albums released in 2002, and if you like good, honest, pop record with a little bit of heart, go buy it - they're a very good american band, and are worthy of more attention than just listening to \\"popular\\" and deciding that their further albums are going to be ...

B00005JKHP|4.0|Say what you want about Paramount and their milking the Star Trek cow dry, they definitely did right by the fans by releasing this director's cut of the first movie.  Viewing it again, it's not as bad as the critics made it out to be.  Visually, it's the best looking of the movies (except for those Dr. Denton Star Fleet Uniforms).  Let's face it, V'ger was always just the maguffin to get the original crew back together, and I can remember back in 1979 when anticipation ran high on this picture (just like in the 1960's when a new Connery Bond was due).  The enchanced effects and tighter editing definitely improves the film, and I'm glad that grandmaster Robert Wise was involved (God, we could use a director who can combine art and technique like him again). So see it again, for the first time...

0553381709|5.0|Is it actually better than &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;?  Yes, it is.  &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is a big, sweeping, impressive novel.  George R. R. Martin displays an excellent sense of showmanship in this volume, making almost every scene more enjoyable.  The pace is up, the action is fierce, and the surprises just keep on happening.<br />In contrast to &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, where the story crept by pretty slowly for the first eight-hundred pages and then went into high gear at the end, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; starts off with a bang, or perhaps I should say several bangs, and never slows down.  In King's Landing, Sansa Stark meets with the Tyrell family and is soon engaged to be married to the Lord of Highgarden.  North of the Wall, the Rangers battle an army of Wights at the Fist of the Firstmen, an encounter from which few survive.  Lady Catelyn releases Jaime Lannister from Riverrun after making him swear an oath to return her daughters alive.  Jorah Mormont convinces Daenerys Targaren to take an unexpected detour rather than sailing to meet Magister Illyrio at Braavos.  And all of this is just in the first hundred pages.  Now you may think that I've given away some key plot points here, but I promise that I haven't.  You'll understand why when you read the book.<br />All of our favorite characters return for more adventures, although remarkably few of them remain alive by the end of the book.  But best of all, Martin takes some of the people that we thought we knew and sends them in surprising new directions.  For instance, Jon Snow remains loyal to the Seven Kingdoms and most of the oaths that he swore; that's not too surprising.  But the sequence of events that he takes part in is extraordinary.  You'll never be able to guess what happens to him by the time that the novel ends.  It also notable that we get some chapters from the perspective of Jaime Lannister, and he turns out to have a much different personality than what you might expect.  We see Catelyn growing increasingly depressed and desperate as she waits for news of Sansa and Arya, though that's certainly not all that happens to her.  Tyrion's chapters, which again show him navigating the court intrigues in King's Landing, are, for some reason, for fun than they were in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.  Another very good thing about this book, though, is that by the end of it Martin seems to be promising that he'll send some of the characters off to new adventures in places that we haven't seen before.<br />Martin keeps the quality of the storytelling high throughout.  Unlike some fantasy authors, he clearly puts a considerable amount of thought into every conversation.  We barely see any amount of space wasted on unnecessary material, and the characters to generally act in believable ways.  For instance, children in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; behave like children, rather than like small adults.  They often act without much logic or foresight, and have a childish set of priorities.  Another aspect of the story where Matin does well is in analyzing the psychology of the characters involved.  He understands that fighting in a war for years on end wears people down, that losing family members is not an easy experience to overcome, and so forth.  Also, he shows the fact that kings and other leaders have to take such factors into account in order to prevent revolts by their own underlings.  Overall, the writing in this book is high-quality, and I'm eagerly anticipating &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;.
6305041156|5.0|This is a magnificent movie. It is visually beautiful - the colors and the way the shots are framed are stunning.  The visuals are controlled in ways that add to the poetic power of the story.  I do not speak Japanese, but the sound of the language combined with the musical score also adds to the intensity of this movie. The subtitles are good, but I am sure that those who understand Japanese get even more from this story.<br />This is not a film of Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear&quot;.  Rather, it is an adaptation and is based on the underlying themes of the play.  It is not important for me to list the differences between the play and the movie, it is just important that a first time viewer not expect the Shakespearian story.  If you know the play you will recognize aspects of the movie and enjoy the ways in which Kurosawa adapted the story to his own and Japanese sensibilities.  It may nod to Shakespeare, but Kurosawa makes this his story.<br />The costumes, music, and acting are superlative.  For me, the trademark Kurosawa battle scenes are more wonderful here than usual.  This is a masterpiece by a filmmaking virtuoso who is also a sensitive enough artist to make a spectacular movie that is also poetic, humorous and heart breaking, tender and brutal as well images that are beautiful and others that are hideous.<br />This isn't light viewing or mind candy, but it has so much to offer that it is worth watching and learning from over and over again.

While the truths are universal, the language and references are very much of a particular generation: those of us who were the bridge between the Age of the Hippie and the Age of Punk. Brilliant, Nick.<br />P.S. You can read this after seeing the film, no problem. In fact, you will realize that the changes made in the script made a lot of sense for movie purposes. Fortunately, there is so much great stuff in the book it won't hurt a bit.

1400031354|4.0|Not a word in the many five-star reviews you'll read here is hyperbole - Precious really is precious, and about as endearing and original a character as you'll find in fiction in the last decade or so. But a warning: in the second novel in the series (which starts with The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency), the author takes too much for granted; specifically, he trades on the patience and sympathy readers will feel for his main characters, the wonderful setting and the air of the romantic and exotic that pervades the books. The most dangerous example is the throw-away subplot involving Mr J.L.B.'s ill-tempered housemaid. Jeopardy involving her is cleverly built up, but then carelessly discarded, as if McCall Smith had simply grown weary of this particular subplot. That is a betrayal of the crime writer's craft, and is simply not good enough. This is an isolated failing, but it make one more nervous about borderline cases: at the moment, so many of the simpler plots are used to explore hilarious minor characters, and to allow Precious and her sidekick to show as much caring as cunning. That's fine. What's not so fine is the suspicion that all this may degerate into middle-period Rumpole, that wasteland in which John Mortimer had dumped his most famous creation, with nothing but his own loveable eccentricities for comfort. &quot;Action is character&quot; is an axiom they use in the movie business, and it is worth citing here. At his best, McCall Smith reveals character through action, dialogue and internal musings. Where action is present, particularly in the detective genre, it must surely have purpose and thrust. It must, on ocassion, be puzzling and paradoxical. It must, at the very least, be interesting. Trouble is, Precious herself is so fascinating that, as this tiny little plotting sin reveals, McCall Smith may feel that he does not need to give her very much to do. Should he act on that erroneous belief, he will find his charismatic and sympathetic character becoming - like Rumpole - a bit of a bore.

He said, \\"Why are you going to watch (old) Ozzy? Come with me to watch the Strokes instead\\". I watched the Ozzy concert anyway (he is the prince of darkness, master of the universe, after all), but bought the Strokes CD. It took a couple of listenings to get used to -- hey, there haven't been any good rock acts in the late 90s, but the Strokes are brilliant. I positively love them. And while Ozzy still rules, the Strokes are it for 2002 as far as I'm concerned.
B00004Z459|1.0|Everyone I've talked to said Linkin Park was incredible and awesome. I am a huge fan of rap/metal but this is nothing like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. It was terrible. Their way of blending rap and rock was stupid. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit combine them so well you almost can't tell when they've converted their singing. BUt Linkin Park starts singing rock then coverts so quickly it's annoying (especcially in the song IN THE END) I hated it and if I could have given it 0 stars I would. If you are in to other rap/metal bands and you're hoping to find the same musical genius in these guys then you're out of luck. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS IS THE ... ALBUM EVER
B00004Z459|1.0|This has been said many times, but linkin park is a tragedy to the modern world of music. Music is my life and to see these no talent ass-clowns come in and think they are talented and original. The album is not that long thank the heavens above, All the songs sound exactly the same, and pinpoint the exact topic of discusion in every song. How much life sucks. Well it doesnt when you sell millions of records. When I first saw this band in a commercial promoting there cd (hmmmmm) I thought they were the lamest band ever to form, and I was right. Chester thinks he is sensetive because he doesnt cuss, but uses \\"shut up when Im talking to you\\" as an excuse. Over excessive cussing is stupid, like limp bizkit, but not cussing at all is just not permitted. If there was a music police, these guys would be arrested on the release of this album. Music died for me when the smashing pumpkins broke up, and bands like this make me want to kill myself.
B000066NW0|5.0|Good music never selects its singer. As long as the music sounds great ,anybody can sing it pretty well and that's just what Avril wants to tell you all. What amazed me most is that she is able to write all the songs by herself which is quite rare among young artists nowadays ( Take Britney or Mandy Moore as an example). <br />The first time I have seen Avril's MTV, my mind is set...... I've got to buy her album no matter at what course. After listening to all the 13 songs, I know that my instinct had taught me well this time. Okay I will put everything in a nutshell...... these 13 songs have souls . Each song represents one's feeling or even a relationship that's based on  this talented artist experience. <br />I would like to take this opportunity to stress that Avril IS NOT a skater punk. She just skateboarded in high school and people started to make her sound like a skater punk which is quite unfair for her. Really,<BR>it's true !!! You can't just simply judge people by their hobby, their clothing or style.Those critics out there haven't even seen the inner side of Avril Lavigne.<br />Last but not least, don't like Avril Lavigne for who she is then you won't like her for who she is and what you are going to get is who she is. Buy her album and give her a hand towards archiving her goal, she's the best female artist I have ever seen, what more can I say...:-)
B00006RAKP|2.0|I admit...I'm ashamed of myself ! As long as I've collected music...I've ALWAYS researched before making a purchase...whether it's a new release...or an anthology. For Elton John's &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002...I didn't...and my recommendation is that if you're a devoted Elton John fan....bypass this one ! It's incomplete in every area you can think of ! Refer to reviews here by people like Robert Hrycay and Dave O...I share their opinions as well !<br />Here's my list of problems .You have important hits missing here from the 70's and 80's...the sound quality isn't that great....and they fade out of songs that ended &quot;cold&quot; origionally...for example...&quot;Daniel&quot; ! I almost fell out of my chair....maybe an overreaction...but you don't physically alter classic songs (like the edited version of &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; by STYX that still &quot;sails&quot; around on radio occasionally)! Oh...and forget the so called &quot;bonus disc&quot;...I call it the &quot;bogus disc&quot;...that should have been used to make a more complete collection !<br />The less devoted Elton John fan will likely find this collection suitable...and the booklet included is nice...but we &quot;diehards&quot; should take Robert Hrycay's advice here and &quot;burn&quot; our own collection...or buy &quot;To Be Continued&quot; that you'll find on this site. You can even expand THAT collection on your own if you like. Fortunately I have some friends who like Elton's music enough to take this set off of my hands !
B00006RIO7|5.0|Yes, it's wonderful. Etc, etc, etc. They all have great voices.<br />But I think the Lil' Kim/Queen Latifah/Macy Gray version of Cell Block Tango is great. Although yes, the amazon.com reviewer is correct, \\"Love is a Crime\\" is blah. In fact, it's horrible. They should've left that off and put \\"I Move On\\" last, in my humble opinion.<br />Still, go buy it! It's got some great bonus material on the website you can unlock when you buy this.
B00006RU5B|1.0|I find that most who like Audioslave, don't like Rage Against The Machine.  Those people are tasteless.  Rage was perfect.  Anyone who would rather listen to Audioslave has a deaf mind.<br />Now for the review.  They're a good band, but not pure or relentless.  Same with their CD.  I suggest buying Rage Against The Machine's first Album and listening to it prior Audioslave's.
0312305060|5.0|I'm not sure how well this will work as a movie, but as a book, it's excellent. The streams of conciousness are very well done, and it's exquisitely written. Cunningham's a genius, folks.
B0000508U6|4.0|Excellent debut achievement from Coldplay. If you're curious to hear what the rest of the album sounds like, not just the three excellent singles, download &quot;Spies&quot; or &quot;Don't Panic&quot;. <br />The thing I love about this album is that it works well as a whole unit - I don't find myself skipping tracks and playing others through over and over again. I set aside one hour or so, sit down, and listen to the whole thing all the way through.<br />Beautiful music. Great for night driving. Four and a half stars because it's slightly on the short side, and they have potential for REAL greatness. Highly reccomended.
1587990717|5.0|I am deeply impressed by the author's critical thinking and his courage for challenging \\"popular\\" thoughts and gurus/academics/masters of universe who are more successful (in wealth and fame) than the author himself.<br />With vivid use of interesting stories and histories, the author points out that we, human beings, are probability blind (fooled by randomness). For \\"long term\\" investment and trading success, we have to fight hard against our natural instincts, that we should use mathematics as a means of thinking instead of computing; that we should be aware of the noise (non significant price fluctuations), randomness of pure conincidence in past incidents, survivorship bias etc before  drawing causalties; that of solon's warning of \\"it aint over until it's over\\"; that of the possibility of a quantum leap/jump (non linearity) instead of a gradual change of events .... and many other biases and misunderstandings.<br />In case you still dont have a clue of what I wrote above and just wanna know whether you really need this book or not, please give the following quiz (pg. 159) a try:-<br />A test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives. The disease strikes 1/1000 of the population. People are tested at random, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the disease. A patient's test is positive. What is the probability of the patient being striken with the disease? Most doctors answered 95%. The answer is the conditional probability that the patient is sick and the test shows it - close to 2%. Less than one in five professionals got it right.<br />If you dont get the above right, I strongly recommend you to buy the book. It will give you a preventive shot against the faults and errors inherent in your journalists' investment reports.<br />p.s. (Ans: Out of 1000 patients who are administered the test, one will be expected to be afflicted. Therefore 999 are healthy but the test will identify about 50 with the disease (it is 95% accurate). So the correct ratio would be 1 in 51, i.e. 2%)rrect ratio would be 1 in 51, i.e. 2%)
0783114222|5.0|This miniseries is an excellent portrayal of the triumph of the human spirit that was the &quot;Moonrace.&quot;  One of the most amazing things about this program is that the landing of Apollo 11 occurs at the halfway point.  This series truly chronicles the entire Apollo program and makes one ask, &quot;Why haven't we been back for 30 years?&quot;  This series should be required viewing for all American kids.
B00003CXXM|4.0|This thriller set the pace right from the openning credits and never let's up. The cinematography is stunning. The pace is fast but surprisingly believable. The action sequences are quick but highly effective and the one chase fits nicely within the plot. Matt Damon does a nice job. A good evening's entertainment.
B00006LLNU|4.0|( ) is best approached as a big, sonic canvas, immenseley epic, hugeley ambitious and requiring a heck of alot of patience to listen to. <br />Of course comparisons with Radiohead era Kid A are rife (the frontman sounds EXACTLY like Thom Yorke), but if anything this album best resembles Mogwai, and Godspeed! You Black Emperor (if this album appeals to you check albums out by these two).<br />This music perfectly encapsulates musical excellence from start to finish- very visual, technically amazing and lyrics that one else apart from the the band themselves can understand (obviousley adding to the overall feeling of alienation).<br />The downside is that these (made up) lyrics can become extremely repetative- in fact the tracks should be named Yousyllum 1, 2, 3, e.t.c because that's all the frontman (don't know his name) ever seems to sing about.<br />Despite this minor flaw it is perfect at first as back ground music that later comes into focus to the foreground with repeated listens. Hypnotic, demanding, rewarding, truelly epic- an album to dream to.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|I rented this after listening to the producers on NPR. I found this movie very engaging on several levels. It is funny, touching and insightful. IT IS NOT A CHICK FLICK!  Hugh Grant shows a great deal of range and depth in his performance. ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR.
0743424425|5.0|I am 14 years old and haave been reading King for about four years. I have read King's 20 most popular books and this remains his scariest. I think that this is beause the first half gets you familiar with the Torrance's and you start to relate to them. You start sympathizing with Jack, Wendy, and Danny, and then the whole family falls apart. This is one of my favorite King books and is certainly the scariest.<br />                                         -J Maximus
B000001FKY|5.0|This is by far my most favorite album of all times.  I have 2 copies of it.  The music is so awesome.  I listen to it all the time.  So just sit back close your eyes and let Def Leppard take you on a ride that goes on forever.
B00005YUNY|3.0|I must say i was VERY disappointed with the mixing on this DVD.  Where is the low end?  Yes shows used to be all about Chris Squire and his bass pedals shaking the whole arena.  When i watch the Keys To Ascension DVD, And You and I makes my chest hair vibrate. On this cd, you would not know Squire has bass pedals.  I tried all three soundtracks and could not find the bass.<br />Perhaps they should have focused on getting one soundtrack right, rather than three half-... ones.<br />The video quality is way better than Keys to Ascension though.  Hopefully they will get things right when they release the 9012Live DVD.<br />In case anyone is wondering I have a Sony DA4ES reciever, a 12\\" 400 watt JBL sub, a 8\\" 100 watt Polk sub, and six polk r50 speakers for 7.1 surround so it is not a matter of not having the right equipment to shake the house or get the optimal sound.
B000001GQR|5.0|to quote another reviewer from California, &quot;the schubert is absolutely awe-inspiring. Furtwangler is the man.&quot; this quote is absolutely right. In fact, I'm listening to this recording now, or at least a contemporaneous one, seeing that the recording i have is also DG and recorded in 1951, as another reviewer says. I admit I haven't heard the haydn symphony featured on this release, but I'd say if you bought this for the schubert only, you wouldn't regret it.<BR>Furtwangler immediately proves to us that we're in for one of the most exciting orchestral recordings of anything. the introduction is fairly straightforward (for furtwangler, at least) but places an irresistable accelerando into the exposition proper, the themes of which have their own tempos and characters unlike any of the others. After listening to the entire movement, one realizes that these tempos and inflections aren't randomly placed, they relate to each other. for instance, the secondary theme is played in the same tempo throughout exposition, development, and recap, while the first subject is played briskly at first, but at the recap a little more leisurely. Honestly, however, I don't think a lesser conductor than furtwangler could make these idiosyncrasies seem justified. By the way, this is just the first movement. <BR>the second movement is marvellous as well in its rhythmic coloring and detail. Time seems to stop in this movement. the third movement has plenty of drive and the trio is properly warm and delightful. Speaking of drive, the last movement is an edge of the seat thriller that will leave any audience bursting into thunderous ovations.<BR>Bravo furtwangler, on what may be his single best (certainly one of his most famous) recording!
0688107826|4.0|Sherlock Holmes isn't just for kids.  I just finished reading this collection and it was an absolute delight.  I wouldn't call it an absolute page-turner or a book you can't put down, but on certain evenings it can be very addictive to just keep reading.
B000059XUO|5.0|When I wrote this review, the average customer review was five out of five stars. There were 158 out of 185 who rated this film 5 out of 5 stars. That should tell you something. If it doesn't tell you something and you remain ignorant of the obvious, well then, that is what I am for. I am the reviewer. You come to Amazon.com to find out what others think. I come from the masses. I am the majority. I am the film buff. I am telling you that this is a good movie. I am telling you that this is a great action movie. I am recommending that you purchase it if you expect to obtain any kind of a collection. This story is a forced fall from grace. The fall in this story is against the will of the protagonist. The essence of this film is revenge because that fall was ill conceived. And almost all films based on revenge are both drama and action oriented. So you know it will have action, you know it will have drama, and there is a small militia ready to backup the credibility for this particular film. That doesn't leave much else to refute. Just buy it.
B00005JL78|2.0|I have to say i am a huge Speilberg fan, but i was pretty disappointed by this. The premis is brillant, a pre-crime divison, that's a brillant story, but i don't think it was taken to it's full potential. I found myself struggling to stay interested, because it was so long. It's so long it's just boring, some parts of the movie wasn't necessary, it could have been left out to cut time down. If i went to the movies and saw this i would have for sure dozed off. Tom Cruise gives a great performance, as always, but i think this movie was way overated.That's my 2 cents.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love my John Mayer CD, it is the greatest CD I own. I'm so sick of the swear words and all the rap that is taking over the radio stations. This CD is a real break from that!
B000005JA8|5.0|...This record is an amalgamation of all things cool during 1968. It was the Capt. honing in on his eccentric musical taste to make a brilliant record and by God the man succeeded! This avant-garde album, which many regard as a masterpiece, is a must listen. It takes a few listens to fully appreciate Beefheart's taste, but once you find some interesting hooks and quirks, this will be one of your prised albums. Like it or not, you must appreciate this man's musical exploration, it was certainly influential!
0312265859|4.0|I purchased the CD audio version of Hard 8 after having listened to several of the earlier Plum books on audio.  Thie story is good but not as clever as some of the earlier ones, however what worked in the story was nearly destroyed by the narration.  I was VERY disappointed to hear a different narrator from previous audio editions.  This woman does not sound at all like she's from New Jersey.  Her phrasing is awkward and sounds angry rather than the charmingly petulant yet self-effacing performances of previous readers.  It was so dreadful that I almost didn't finish it.  I am a big Stephanie Plum fan, but a large part of her appeal is the fun she pokes at the Jersey \\"culture\\" and herself.  This feeling is completely lost by this narrator, who delivers a performance that is bitchy and humorless, making it impossible for me to like or care about Stephanie in this version.  My advise is: READ this one  but don't LISTEN to it.
0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnson's \\"A History of the American People\\" is written for the American people. And, like his other books, this 900 page volume is beautifully written.<br />Being an immigrant, I was not formally taught the history of America, and until I read Johnson's book, I did not have a good understanding of the history of this great country. This book is splendidly done! Johnson chooses his material with shrewdness, does his research with care, and presents it with a fair mind despite his ideology.<br />Whether or not you have had high school or freshman American history, this book will enrich you with a cohesive presentation of American history. You also get the benefit of the analysis, evaluation and interpretation of people, events, conflicts, and epochal transitions by a historian of the highest caliber.<BR> <BR>You will get to see a little of the imperfections of even the most revered of our leaders, but you will also see how these leaders courageously steered the course of the country at important junctures, politically, militarily, economically, and culturally, and made this country what it is today. And be proud to be an American.
B000003S09|5.0|Something happened 34 years ago, when I first heard (and bought) In the Court of the Crimson King. This album, and the follow-up, In The Wake of Poseidon, started me down a musical trail that hasn't stopped twisting and turning since 1969.<br />I'm now 48. And yet today, when I play In The Court, all that musical influence comes crashing back. Along with the social, political, musical and personal changes afoot at the time.<br />The Vietnam War was raging (with no end in sight), and the 70s offered even more explosive changes. Every traditional attitude was being ripped from its moorings.<br />Younger listeners may find the mellotron 'tinny' by today's electronic standards, and may find the psychodelia of Moonchild somewhat hard to fathom. But few could say this album (as well as In The Wake) fails to go wherever you dare it!<br />I'm here to say that In The Court started within me an explosive charge down a twisted, exciting musical path that still unfolds beneath my feet.<br />From Crimson, it was on to Led Zep. From Zep on to Bowie, Velvet Underground and Eno. Then through to Harold Budd, John Cale and Nico. <br />From there to the Cocteaus, to The Blue Nile and onto Cold Play. <br />More recently, it's been way back to Aaron Copland and forward again to John Adams (via Phil Glass). <br />And somehow, I'd even say that tracks like I Talk To The Wind have been influential in my listening to (and loving) the likes of Pat Metheny, St Germain and the entire ECM Euro-jazz phenomenon.<br />Do yourself a favour. Listen carefully. Over and over and over . . . and see if you aren't on a similar journey.
0792839234|5.0|This movie is very original and captivating, it keeps glued to the screen and keep you curious to know how the plot develops. Did I mentioned that it is also very scarry?. I have the vhs version and the video quality is decent but the sound is very good for a movie this old, with great surround effects, high dynamics and very deep bass. Overall: EXCELLENT.
B000006045|5.0|Well, what can you say.  Daddy G, Shroom, and 3D have done it once again!  This album is a must-have for all trip-hop/electronica-heads out there.  It is truely one of the most beautiful albums ever produced, both in it's dark basslines and also it's graceful melodies.  The menacing beats continue to get harder throughout their records, and it really shows on Mezzanine.  Songs like &quot;Risingson&quot; and &quot;Teardrop&quot; perfectly execute these powerful kicks with a precision unlike any other trip-hop act can accomplish.  From beginning to end, Mezzanine takes you on a journey into the minds of three of the greatest electronic producers on the globe.  This album is near flawless in it's genius, and definitely spends a lot of time in my stereo.

0312243022|3.0|This is a first -- a movie that was much, much better than the book.  The characters in the movie were more nuanced, more ambiguous and ultimately more believable.  By contrast, the book beats the reader over the head with its overwrought emotion.  I felt condescended to by the book, somehow.  Go see the movie -- it is a masterpiece.
B00007BK2N|5.0|A movie that is as fun as it's trailers make it out to be.  Following Steve Coogan through this story is utter joy.  May be a tad over-long, but that is being really, really nitpicky.<br />Go ahead and enjoy!
B000002BBY|4.0|I remember years ago when my brother owned this album and I wanted to make a mix tape.  I wanted to choose the best songs off this album for my tape, but I couldn't pinpoint only two or three songs.  I'm not exagerating here when I say that every song on this album is great.  It is my opinion of course, but I believe Cast No Shadow to be one of the most beautiful songs ever made and it needs to be listened to a good majority of the human population.<br />Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, and Wonderwall are the known classics I suppose and they are also wonderful songs.  I recently bought this album so I could have my own copy of it and I am so glad that I did because now I don't have to choose just one favorite
B00006RINF|5.0|I didn't think Lacuna Coil could top \\"Unleashed Memories\\", and they might not have... but this is darn close.  What a wonderful disc.<br />Lacuna Coil has always been just enough metal to keep me hooked... just enough progressive to keep me hooked... and always enough Cristina Scabbia's vocals to keep me hooked!<br />If you're looking for lightening fast riffs... this is not you're band.  The music (for metal) can be slow as molasses at times.  But the great thing about Lacuna is that everything is in context.  It all sounds like it all belongs together - fanstasic arrangements.<br />Oddly enough (catch the pun?) I think the best tracks are the odd numbered ones 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and the title track.<br />Track 1 \\"Swamped\\" starts out with rocking riff and the back and forth vocals of Cristina and male vocalist Andrea Ferro.  I've always thought the combination of Ferro's rough vocals and Scabbia's angelic voice worked well together and this opening track showcases it.  The line \\"its just a melody - it bleeds in me\\" describes the track well - a fantastic melody to this jewel.<br />Track 3 \\"Daylight Dancer\\" is another example of the fantastic vocal overlay of Cristina and Andrea.  The precussion work during the chorus is fantastic and the song is relatively slow, but retains a  \\"heavy\\" feel to it.  Absolutely enchanting vocals here with some wicked work on the drums - no overplaying - this is something LC understands - its about the group - no one instrument is accented over another.<br />Track 5: Self Deception (my personal fave..) This songs rocks.  I love the lyrics here. Crushing riffs during the verses and then again... Cristina's lush voice for the chorus - her emotion comes through loud and clear here.  The bass work really shines on this track as well.  A short song,with no filler - a nice 20 second guitar riff/solo at the 2:40 mark.<br />Track 7 \\"Tight Rope\\" - my favorite part of this is all the double bass kicking during the chorus.  The formula here is thesame as other places on the disc - male vocals for the verses and female for the chorus.  Heavy, vibrating guitar throughout. During the bridge (2:40 to 3:10) there is the same guitar riff followed by a different precussion fill - absolute genius here!!<br />Track 9: \\"Unspoken\\" The \\"get up and dance\\" track on the CD.  You just can't sit still while listening to this track.  Andrea and Cristina sing together on the chorus here - with most of the volume going to Cristina.  Crunchy guitar work during the verses and a beatuifully orchestrated chorus.<br />Track 11: \\"The Prophet Said\\" :  Crunchy, heavy riffs all the way through.  I think this is Cristina's best track.  When she breaks into \\"This is my harmony.. I'm in your heart again\\" at 2:20 you really get a showcase of her voice -- and then the incredible, angelic overlays of her voice from 3:00 to 3:45 are stunning - all followed a heavy, crunchy riff leading to the trailer of the song.<br />I wouldn't want to forget the fantastic lyrical content of \\"Entwined\\" or the force in Andrea's voice in \\"Angel's Punishment\\" The growling \\"Can't you take me away from your lies?\\" works very well for the penultimate track - a case of agression used well.<br />Buy it now - get them all from Lacuna Coil:  The EP, In a Reverie, HalfLife, Unleashed Memories and Comalies.  Now if only this band will come back and tour the states!!

0679736646|4.0|As much a mystery-style thriller as science-fiction novel, \\"Ubik\\" projects a future (1992, but no matter) in which telepathic citizens, or \\"psis,\\" are hired to invade privacy and spy on businesses, while \\"inertials\\" are employed to neutralize these insidious forces. In this new world, technological advances maintain recently departed citizens in \\"half life,\\" a temporary state of suspended animation, and commercial moratoriums provide access to loved ones until they eventually pass on to their next full life.<br />Glen Runciter is co-owner, with his half-dead (or half-alive) wife, of the leading anti-psi firm. He and his assistant, Joe Chip, find themselves challenged by new, even more sinister forces they don't quite understand. Some of the members of their firm seem to have died in an act of sabotage, but which ones? Who's responsible? What is Ubik, the aerosol spray that claims to do everything (when used as directed)? And why is time regressing to 1939? Every clue seems to be a red herring, and the \\"truth\\" isn't revealed until the very end--or is it?<br />As others have noted, Dick's writing is characteristically featureless (a minimalist, almost pulp-fiction style), but the intricacies of the page-turning plot more than compensate for the pedestrianism. Published in 1969, \\"Ubik\\" still entertains while it scrutinizes (and lampoons) both crass commercialism and metaphysics. On the one hand, the omnipresence of advertising and pay-per-use dispensers is dead-on satire in a century where we've become seemingly immune to paying a couple of bucks for a bottle of water with a fancy label on it. (Perpetually in debt, Joe Chip has to pay every time he opens his refrigerator, uses the shower, and enters--or leaves--his apartment, which leads to some pretty hilarious dilemmas.) On the other hand, how seriously you take the \\"philosophy\\" presented in this book might depend on your beliefs in the afterlife and/or reincarnation (not for nothing does Dick refer twice to the \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\"). But even if such metaphysical concepts aren't your thing, you can still sit back and enjoy the ride.ibetan Book of the Dead\\"). But even if such metaphysical concepts aren't your thing, you can still sit back and enjoy the ride.
3822884979|5.0|This is an excellent overview of the genre, on an artist-by-artist basis, from the classic era of the mid-twentieth century. All of the artists here are deserving of recognition, though only a handful of them are truly well-known and adequately documented in print elsewhere. All of the many artists here are well-represented; the reproduction is flawless, and the commentary is intelligent and well-researched.  The original edition is my point of reference here, so I can't vouch for this one fully, but it appears to have maintained the integrity of the earlier printing and is a very handsome production as well.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Not a bad movie but after watching it for about the 30th time (my boys ages 5 & 3 love it) it begins to pall quite a bit.  Kirsten Dunst looks awful as a redhead and there is little chemistry between the two lead characters in the romance department (except for the one kiss in the rain).  Casting for Green Goblin & son were well done - lots of great stunt work and the actors look enough alike to make it believable.  Cliff Robertson does a fine job but doesn't appear long enough in the movie to make much of an impact.  After hearing nothing but great things about it after the theater release the actual movie was a bit of a let down but then I've never been the biggest Spidey fan in the world.  If you like comic book superhero movies Xmen or Batman are much better done.  This appears to be a quickly done version compared to the dark version of good vs. evil presented in other movies.  Not worth a sequel!!
B000007T2Z|4.0|This is one of the darkest ambient records I have ever heard.  Maybe ambient isn't the right word, since the band does throw down and makes quite a ruckus once in a while, but for the most part you get drift and atmosphere, inky dark.  On a cloudy day or at dusk, when it is quiet, get comfy and throw this on.  It will mess with your soul and make you think.
B00003CXXM|3.0|My wife and I watched this on DVD. We were disappointed that it was available only in &quot;full screen&quot; format -- i.e. with the edges chopped off -- but decided to view it anyhow. She liked it more than I did.  The premise is intriguing, but its potential is not realized. After a while I didn't really CARE who Bourne is, or was. Matt Damon's acting is wooden, and the endless chase-fight-escape sequences just aren't believable. At one point, I half expected the big secret to be that Bourne is a cyborg, or specially enchanced human (a la &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;) as this is the only plausible explanation for his invincibility. But no, he's just a man. Overall, it's not a bad movie; it's just not very good either.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is thick.  And atmospheric.  The untitled opener stuck in my head for months, and it isn't even the best song.  Organic and atmospheric.  Tight rythm.  Dark, smart lyrics.  Honest.  Atmospheric.  Atmospheric.  Dense.  Atmospheric.  Tense.  Beautiful.  Atmospheric.  Atmospheric.  Atmospheric.
B00006RU5B|1.0|WOW, these guys are so amazing, they put supergroups of the past like Led Zeppelin to SHAME!!! This album is LOADED with tight, heavy, classic rock and roll RIFFS!!! Man, Morello has never sounded more aggressive and innovative. And the rhythm section is so unpredictable, they keep you on the edge of your bed the whole time! Chris' vocals sound like he's gargling water -- ...Thank god he's lost all that annoying articulation from the Soundgarden/Temple of the Dog days. And the lyrics, .... They make de la Rocha sound like Britney Spears!!! The deepest, most politically offensive lyrics you'll ever hear! No self-centered, ambiguous, emo garbage here! (Oh, and I absolutely love their video for Cochise -- ....<br />Overall, this is the greatest TRUE rock 'n roll album to come out in a LONG time. Thank you Audiosalve for rescuing the mainstream from rehashed, corporate, pop-emo-heavy-rock!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|No one else can ever be Johnny Cash.  No one else can cover a song and make it twice as good.  As much as I like nine inch nails, Cash makes trent reznor look and sound like a woman.  On the downward spiral, I never thought of &quot;hurt&quot; being that great a track, and I usually didn't listen.  Johnny Cash makes me listen.  And get goosebumps.  And hit repeat.  Every single track here cuts deep into me.  Buy four copies.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|Have been a fan of Johnny Cash for many years and own most of his titles. However I am really disappointed in this one. It seems to be a rather endless dark dirge with little of the character of earlier  efforts.  I thought Water from the Wells of Home and American recordings some of his better later Cd's.
B000002UAU|3.0|I see why the Beatles were popular and held in high esteem.  The songs pretty much define what a hit sounds like: simple, catchy, concise, universal.  There is personality and good production and chops and novel ideas.  Pretty much every song on \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" embodies all these things.  For that reason, I cannot imagine giving this record less than three stars.  I also cannot imagine enjoying this record.<br />My First Impressions and Thoughts:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>My parents had no Beatles records, and no radio stations I listened to ever played them, so today I am hearing Sgt. Pepper's for the first time.  <br />Not having grown up saturated with the music of The Beatles is difficult to understand for some people, I'm sure.  I imagine you couldn't walk down the street in the late sixties without hearing them.  Somewhere, as you read this, there is a man in his fifties with a salt and pepper beard and a \\"Cosby sweater\\" sitting in a leather chair in his living room, looking out the window at his kids playing.  He put on this record to relive his youth.  He hears Sgt. Pepper's and remembers trying pot for the first time, kissing that cute girl he had a crush on in high school, his dear departed mother and the fantastic meals she made, fearing he'd go blind from his activities behind closed doors, etc.  <br />I hear this and think of sesame street, because it is simple and a child would enjoy it.  <br />Boy, John Lennon sure had a whiny voice.  I read in other reviews on this site that Lennon claims Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds has nothing to do with drugs.  I believe him, because this is the the most childish description of a trip I have ever heard.  <br />The only song I recognised on here is the one Joe Cocker covered,  the one they used for the Wonder Years.  How appropriate, since this record is much like that show: someone else's drab nostalgia.  At least the Wonder Years had Winnie Cooper.<br />Simple, catchy, blah, blah, blah.  Despite a bit of experimenting, this record is bland like wonder bread.  <br />The sitar is a terrible instrument.  I hate India very much. <br />At least this last song has some cool tape loops.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<br />After listening a couple more times, my opinion of this record improved, but I still won't be listening to it ever again.  In music, I look for beauty, energy, atmosphere, and edge.  A record doesn't have to have all those qualities in order for me to like it.  For example, Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash has tons of energy and edge, and just a bit of atmosphere and beauty.  I feel that the songs on Sgt. Pepper's have enough beauty and energy to get by, but not enough to make up for a lack of edge and atmosphere.  You might look for something else in music, and disagree with me completely.  <br />In short, great pop songs that make me feel nothing.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first got the CD, I didn't think it'd be that great, i changed my mind when i first popped the CD in my CD player! The whole thing is great!
B000000W5N|5.0|I'm feeling really old now when I consider I got this album when it was a new release, and I was still in high school.  While it would be impractical to pull the same thing with a CD, I remember the original record album had a working zipper on the cover.  When you pulled the zipper down, you got a glimpse of what is now the back cover of the CD.  While not something I'd put up on my wall, it was reflective of a time when an Andy Warhol gimmick such as this was considered art.  Maybe it was, or maybe it wasn't, but it did show that the Stones were so rich even then that they could afford something like this.  <br />Another reflection is the casual drug references throughout the record.  One could argue that \\"Sister Morphine\\" is an anti-drug song.  But once again, the casualness of how they mention \\"a needle and a spoon\\" in \\"Dead Flowers\\" shows they were in different times.  It's weird that with all the drug and misogynist lyrics in songs today, I consider them all marketing and it doesn't move me a whole lot.  But could you imagine what would happen the Stones released an new album today with the lyrics \\"whip the women just around midnight\\" today?  Yes, times have changed.  <br />But the bottom line is that this is a terrific collection of songs, probably their best single album ever.  \\"Brown Sugar\\" is classic bad-boy Stones, and deserves to be the biggest hit of the collection.  But the variety of music is impressive.  The slower songs like \\"Sway\\", \\"Wild Horses\\", and \\"I Got the Blues\\" give it balance.  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\" provides a rare long jam in a rock and roll record.  And who would have thought the goofy country parody \\"Dead Flowers\\" would appear on a Rolling Stones album?  <br />Like I said, I played it again and again and...
0375704027|5.0|It is one of those books that comes along and sneaks up on you.  By the time you put it down you realized that it has moved you.  When Watanabe read Midori's letter I felt an emptiness in my stomach as if she had written the letter to me.  The whole book is like this.  You can't help but fall in love with the characters.
0064471047|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, of course, loved by millions as a classic, and it truly deserves its distinction. Rarely will any reader of any genre find a story so moving and entertaining and so enlightening. I can't recommend anything more highly than this little volume.<br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter who wander through an old wardrobe into the magical world of Narnia. What follows is their adventure as they team with a nation of talking animals and other magical creatures versus the evil powers in the kingdom. The novel climaxes with one extraordinary act of love which tears through the kingdom and changes everything and everyone after.<br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is such a successful novel. It does serve as a wonderfully powerful read. The book also enlightens the reader with its commentary Christian symbolism on the nature of love. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic, and I really think that it is just now coming into what may be its most popular period. The world is pleading for some type of meaning, and here, Lewis is willing to offer it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|It's one thing if you understand the concept of this ground breaking album, and it's another if you do not. This album, like most of Marilyn Manson's albums, is many years ahead of its time. Reading through a chunk of the reviews here at Amazon.com, it's evident who does and who does not understand this album. <br />Antichrist Superstar is a semi-autobiographical record, with a unique, sophisticated, and original idea of him becoming Friedrich Nietzsche's Overman. If you didn't catch onto this, you don't have the right to speak of the lyrical content on Antichrist Superstar. If you took Marilyn Manson as being a sadist, I pity you. When you finally get a grasp of the concept of this album, there isn't an apparent pessimistic or optimistic feel you get from Marilyn Manson-- simply a realistic one. To put it simply, the message of the album is that, the battle between religion and atheism, good and evil, right and wrong..ect, will never be won, he is simply another player in this eternal battle. Only our scars remain to remind us of the battles we fought. Eternal Occulance. <br />Shock Rocker my ...<br />It's a tiring tiring term. If Marilyn Manson is shocking and grabbing your attention for this long, and especially because there's so much out there, that means he's good. That's the bottom line. He's said countless times that he's never intended to shock. Because Manson has been around for 10 years and he's said he's not a millionare, it also implies that Marilyn is not in this for the money. Alas my brothers, love of art is the driving force here.
B0000048V8|5.0|I bought this for my baby's first Christmas, and have watched it myself many times.  I first saw this when I was a child and have loved it ever since.  It is imagination-enhancing as it has no dialogue, just images and music.  I especially love the scenes where the boy and the snowman are flying over the town.  Raymond Briggs truly captures the emotions of a little boy building a snowman, and his adventures when the snowman comes to life.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|For fans of Jennifer, this is the ultimate dvd to own. In one scene she reluctantly agrees to visit the pimp who gives her a few dollars for her services. In the grand finale of the movie (which unfortunately is done with rapid quit cuts) Jennifer is sold to a large group of men who are having a \\"party\\". Let's just say that Jennifer and another female are the center of attention at this party making this unrated directors cut a must-have dvd.
0684803356|4.0|If you're a Hemingway fan, then you should not miss this book. There's a reason why many people feel this is his best novel. The scenery, character development, plot and overall picture in words make this a masterpiece. With the Spanish civil war as his launching point he makes great strides in making the reader feel the grip of ANY war past or present. What you get here is a lot of his philosophy on war, life, love and death. A theme with which he was more than passively familiar having had several near-death experiences until he finally took his own life. Compared to many of his other works, the ending is also somewhat of a fresh surprise. The John Donne quote cited in the fly leaf speaks volumes about the current troubles in the world today. Like all great literature, despite being written more than sixty years ago, this book still feels fresh and new.
0451160916|4.0|This is a book about a family and with all that can go wrong in their world. A story about the horror of a hotel and the damage that can be consumed. You may only know this dieing secret in THE SHINING.
0345448898|2.0|I bought this trilogy after it kept coming up in my Amazon recommendations.  So many people had written rave reviews; I thought I'd really enjoy the series.  Instead, I got a rambling mess, with overtones of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, Richard Adams' Shardik, Lord of the Flies, folklore, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, and every sub-par parallel worlds episode that Star Trek ever made.  The characters aren't consistent from one book to the next.  Plotlines are abandoned without a trace.  And the writing is dull and unevocative.  I'll give it two stars for a few interesting ideas and the fact that I managed to get through it, but I certainbly wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  You'll be seeing my set on [website] soon.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Take one totally miscast hero--Guy Pearce--throw in a turgid, meandering storyline, and for spice, mix in a totally boring heroine and you've got a complete waste of time. How Guy Pearce was selected to be the major character of an action movie like this is something only out-of-touch movie moguls will ever know. But you think of such charismatic could-be's: Hugh Jackman, Mel Gibson, Jude Law--even, for God's sake, John Travolta--who could have been more believable. And then the idiotic story line. I'm a sucker for the simple, dazzling l961 George Pal version starring that glorious hunk, Rod Taylor, who gave the movie so much resonance. Thank God I only rented this one. The special effects are like those you'd expect from a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. One day, let's hope they really remake this fascinating idea into the magnificent project it could be. Only this time, get a hero who doesn't look like he's just been released from the emergency room of an inner city hospital.
B00005YW4H|4.0|When I'd heard the name Norah Jones bandied about I was curious to know what kind of music she sang. I went out and bought this CD without ever hearing one song off of it. I'm not a big fan of jazz or blues but I play this CD constantly. There isn't one song on it that I don't like.<br />The title track &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is a gorgeous song and it's my absolute favorite. <br />Norah Jones has a wonderfully distinctive voice. It makes for a nice change because so many of the girls out there singing all sound alike.
0553381709|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I am a huge fantasy fan and his book is everything I could have hoped for. It is a story about a battle of kings to see who will rule the entire kingdom. The book is written so every main character has a bunch of chapters from their point of view. The characters get so spread out that you can learn about what's going on just about everywhere in the kingdom. It makes you want to keep reading because the book could be called cliffhanger. Every single chapter seems to have one and each one is better then the last so when you finish a chapter and you see who is next you just have to keep reading to find out what happens to them. The characters are so well developed that it is hard not to know what there thinking. When I read this book it made me feel like I was actually there. If you like fantasy even half as much as me you will enjoy this book. Be sure though to read the first two of the series first they are called A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is an entertaining and complex comic collection.  It is part mystery(some one is killing retired heroes) and part revised history(what would the world be like with super beings). The book covers around 15-20 years of history.  From Vietnam to \\"today.\\"  There are great characters and the villain and his motives in the end are quite a surprise.
B000060P79|4.0|let me start by saying i absolutely loathe skate-pop music (calling it punk is just... wrong.), and i only pickd it up on a strong reccomendation from a friend. this is suprisingly intelligent music for a band in this genre. sure, the lack of maturity is there (i happen to have the version of the album with the 2 bonus tracks, and the second bonus track makes me want to vomit at how terribly whiney it is)- but simple plan holds it together. it kicks off with a pure gem- \\"i'd do anything\\"... the lyrics in this song are so accesible without being terribly cliched. a majority of the songs start to get a little repetitive, but bathroom humor is kept to a suprising low- and if thats the price, i'll pay it. the best track on the disc is without a doubt, \\"meet you there\\" a ballad that really catches you by suprise smack in the middle of the album. all in all, this cd is a simple delight.
B00003CXXM|2.0|I can understand that a story can be freely adapted but this movie is something completely different from its source even if it is still mentioned in the credits ... Robert Ludlum should be upset!<BR>They even changed Jason's character making him the killer he was only feigning to be; then they also suppressed his opponent, Carlos, who was the reason itself for Jason's existence!!!<BR>The book was a real thriller while this is only a MINOR action movie at the same level of those from Jean-Claude Van Damme :-(
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes &quot;Is This It&quot; does not have a bad song on it... I have memorized the entire CD, Julian's vocals rock. I love all the songs on it, especially &quot;Last Nite&quot; and &quot;Barely Legal.&quot; Strokes=Love. Everyone should buy it.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is one of Hollywood's most beloved classic's. Even watching it now it's not hard to tell why it's a classic or why it won an acedemy award for best picture. It's perfect, has memorable dialogue, well done humor, well written characters with real emotion, pride and dignity, and an intriguining plot. It's also very romantic and shows that a movie could end satisfying without the hero getting the girl.<br />  The main character Rick Blaine (Humprey Bogart) changes a lot by the time the movie ends, he goes from being self-centered to doing the right thing and letting the on he loves get on a plane without him to possibly never see her again.<br />  Movies these days just aren't that smart, especially not any of the Romantic ones you get. You mostly always get guy gets girl, the end. If the guy doesn't get the girl you're not satisfied but here you are because Rick still has his dignity at least.<br />  Casablanca may be one the most romantic movies ever made it surprisingly has a bit of a march tone to it. It's mushy enough for women to enjoy with the excellent chemestry and dialogue that Humphray Bogart and Ingrid Bergman share.<br />  Bogart in a way is like John Wayne where he makes you want to be just like him. These days a character can't make a point without cursing and yelling but all Bogart has to do to look depressed or tough and make his point is just make a motionless expression.<br />  So Casablanca works for both sexes,  guys can relate to Bogart's Rick. Any women who fell in love but at the wrong time can relate to Bergman. Can't really think of any actor's that actually draw you in more  into their roles than Humphrey Bograt and Ingred Bergman do in this movie.<br />  Besides the acting being very good Michael Curtiz's direction is splendid. You actually feel as if you're there, with the big flashing lights pointing towards Rick's pub as people enter or walk out of it, also when a charcter is standing by the window you see that light flashing by. That light gives a presence that the Nazi's are there and that eventhough it's Rick's pub they pretty much have all the control over it. You feel the fear and emotion of the people in Rick's pub, they fear that they'll be taken by the Nazi's to one of their war camps.<br />  Curtiz's also makes you feel as if you're at the airport at the end saying good-bye right along with Rick as well. He holds your complete attention right to Bogart's classic line at the end, \\"Louie, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\". There's no wonder why Casablanca is such a huge favorite to so many, it's just perfect.y.

B00003CXDG|1.0|This is the type of movie that is so bad that it can't be rated. You'd think that with endless millions to spend, someone could be found to think up a creative plot. The same old tired worn out killer virus and the whole planet will die theme--ugh. Then the face masks used over and over and over. Duh, doesn't anyone notice that even though these people have the same face, they're not the same size as the real ones? When Ambrose disguises himself as hunt, didn't Nyah notice that there was a slight difference in height? The script also liberally borrowed from a number of other movies, including the Matrix, among others. <br />All in all, something to avoid at all cost.

B00005JL78|5.0|I am obsessed with this film.  I've watched it five times since buying the DVD about a month ago.  I confess I haven't yet checked out the supplemental material, which makes me less qualified to give a review of the complete DVD package.  I want to analyze the film itself in deep detail before I watch the filmmakers tell us how they worked their magic.<br />Let me state upfront, also, that I don't like Tom Cruise and wanted to watch the film only because it was based on a Philip K. Dick story.  (I am not a huge science fiction fan but do enjoy Dick's work; he wasn't a great writer stylistically but he was a fount of interesting, peculiar and paranoid ideas.)  Cruise's performance is less shallow than usual and doesn't detract from the viewing experience, which is the highest praise I'm ever likely to give him.<br />Minority Report is flawed, yes, but engaging from start to finish.  Chase scenes dominate much of the latter part of the first hour, presumably to give us an adrenaline rush in case we felt the exposition was a bit slow.  I find this unnecessary, as the exposition itself is exciting indeed, but on an intellectual level.  It was as if Spielberg decided he ought to have some action scenes that he could put into the trailer in hopes of attracting a broader audience.  This is primarily a metaphysical story, and--to some degree, especially in the scenes involving the abducted precog, Agatha--an emotional one.  (The one line of dialogue retained from the original short story was the remark that the guilt of the pre-criminals was a \\"metaphysical fact\\".) <br />Also, the endless repetition of the lines \\"Everybody runs\\" and \\"Can you see?\\" seem like transparent attempts to create for the film catch phrases which the producers hoped would, like Schwartzenegger's \\"I'll be back\\", insinuate themselves into the popular lexicon.  But these calculated attempts to improve the film's box office don't detract, not too much.  The chase scenes, for example, are interesting as they reveal yet more technological wonders we haven't yet seen in this believable future world.<br />Some spoilers are coming, so stop reading if you haven't seen the film yet.<br />The murdered-child element was wholly a creation of the screenwriters (Spielberg probably had some input here, too--kids figure prominently in so many of his films) but it adds depth to the story.  Though the fact that Crow, Anderton's predicted victim, isn't really a pedophile (the whole thing is a set-up, to provoke Anderton into murderous rage) drains away some of the emotional impact.  Is Crow torn between wanting to survive while also feeling that maybe he deserves to die?  No, it all turns moot.<br />Some material has peculiar resonance for me, but this will not be so for other viewers.  I have recurring dreams, ones which have a sped-up feel that looks very much like a DVD on fast-forward (and not entirely dissimilar to the look-and-feel of the precog's visions), in which I am a slave being tortured.  (Think it's time for me to find another job?)  The way the pre-criminals are held in the containment facility--with their bodies in stasis, but their minds \\"busy busy busy\\" as the jailkeeper says--reminds me strikingly of those dreams.<br />Spielberg's films always have happy endings, and this is no exception.  Cruise's resurrection is inconsistent with the impression given before, that \\"haloing\\" is permanent, but at least we have the satisfaction of seeing the villain get his comeuppance.<br />This isn't an action film.  Philosophical and religious themes abound in Philip K. Dick's stories.  This is the first Hollywood movie to truly reflect Dick's vision, a film which can rightfully claim to be an adapation of his narratives rather than--like Blade Runner and Total Recall, not bad films but not great either--merely \\"inspired by\\" them.  Of course the film is much more detailed than the short story, but this is one of those rare cases where the original is improved upon.  Those characters which were added by the screenwriters were added for good reasons, ones which advance the plot.  Many here at amazon have criticized the art direction; I say it's superb.  Notice the repetition of underwater sequences--the pool where Anderton loses his son, the freezing bathtub where he hides from the spyders, the murder of Anne Lively...even the Fox logo at the beginning looks underwater, and has the same pale blue glassy look as the computer systems seen throughout.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Being a bit of a jazz fan who looks down upon pop-jazz artists as sell-outs, I was initially a little be apprehensive about this album. Sure she was beautiful and sure the lead single was immensely popular, but so many jazz singers turn out to turn more mainstream (as is the case of the latest work by Diana Krall). <br />After listening to it at first, I thought what just about any jazz purist would say: &quot;this is not jazz!&quot; And that is the point; this should not be compared to jazz music. Krall's music DOES fit more in jazz that this album; in fact this album is a little of a classification oddity.<br />Most listeners simply say it is a bit of a cross between pop, jazz and country. This is not too far off from the truth. One thing that I think people have failed to notice is just how much the songs could fit easily on an album by one of the greatest singer/songwriters that ever lived; James Taylor. <br />In fact, it should be noted that this album is almost definitely more suited to fans of Mr. Taylor than perhaps fans of Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald or Lady Day herself. The classification nightmare is due to the fact that she is signed to Blue Note, a label that is almost exclusively jazz. Yes, it is jazz tinged, but so are some of James Taylor's songs such as &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot;.<br />The album is a very mellow experience and is a perfect showcase for her exquisite voice (another thing she has in common with James Taylor). It is unique in that it has been released by a new artist in a climate where most songs are created by people who deserve more credit than the singers themselves. It harks back to the simpler times of the Early 1970s when James Taylor and groups like Bread were in their prime. Admittedly, the best tracks are &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, but all are enjoyable and we must remember that this is her first album; even artists like Stevie Wonder, Prince and Marvin Gaye didn't hit fullstride until a few years later into their career.<br />In closing, this is an album for fans of that kind of music. If you are looking for jazz, go by Kind of Blue or something like that (just stay away from Kenny G).
B000059QY3|5.0|The combination of Angela Gheorghiu and Frank Lopardo is enough to make any production shine.  Add to it the incomparable Sir Georg Solti, the surprising, but always wonderful Leo Nucci and the amazing music of Verdi and you have a production that cannot be beaten.  Gheorghiu's amazing ability to portray emotion in her face as well as her voice makes her stand out in the opera world.  I get so tired of opera singers who can't act.  Lopardo does a fine job, his voice more than makes up for his acting deficiencies.  <BR>It is widely recognized that this performance is what shot Angela Gheorghiu into superstardom and it is well-deserved.  This is a Traviata not to be missed, an amazing interpretation of an amazing work.

Despite the only faint resemblance to the original novel (which I read during my sophomore year of high school and absolutely loved!!), the occasionally painfully lame dialogue between Bourne and his lady friend, and the Jackie Chan (I'm not a fan) action/fight scenes, this movie had enough brass to keep me interested in the theaters and then over the weekend on DVD.  Matt Damon is just a bit young for Jason Bourne, but he was fine.  The whole premise is either A) completely unbelievable or B) absolutely fascinating--take your pick.  It's just a movie, so I'll take B.  Remember folks, it's Hollywood, so don't get bogged down in reality. . . .<BR>Bottom Line:  really good performances, the best chase scene in ages (maybe since The French Connection), and the chance to remember a great writer who churned out four or five amazing novels during that stretch of his career.  It's probably only three or four stars on its own, but I'll jump it up to five in memory of Rober Ludlum.  Now I've got one more book to add to my summer list. . . .

0028643151|5.0|Wow, after reading Mr. Chapman's review, I felt personally obligated to write my own review.<br />DOOMSDAY was not only based on fact, not only was it well-researched, it did the job with simple to understand language.  Never before have I learned about such complex ideas through much easier definitions and concepts.  <br />So, Mr. Chapman, what would you say the odds are that two of our own planes would crash into the World Trade Center, perhaps igniting what may someday be called World War III?  There are too many what-ifs to even begin to mention in such a short review.  This book simply opens one's eyes as to the (very real!!) possibilities that we, or the generations that follow, may someday face.<br />I especially appreciated the scenarios presented before each chapter.  Thank you, Mr. Moran, for an education that was unequaled, and far more interesting, than most of my college science courses!<br />Please, Mr. Chapman, stick with your supposed &quot;research&quot; and leave the book reviews to someone else since you have so little grasp of how constant &quot;change&quot; is in our world.
B000068PQ0|5.0|All over the place, but yeah! I remember the exact moment when I fell in love with the album. It's during \\"In the Morning of the Magicians\\". There's a clean guitar riff that repeats itself in the slow parts, around the \\"What is love and what is hate\\" lines. It puts me in some kind of calming trance. Always. Lovely.<BR>A great album.

B000065V1V|4.0|Unlike most people, the first DB album I ever owned was &quot;Earthling&quot;, which I believe is highly underrated.  Since then, I have gone on to collect most of Bowie's catalog, and I can tell you with absolute certainty, &quot;Heathen&quot; is easily one of my top 4 albums he has ever produced.  This is a surprisingly relevent, well thought out album that maintains thematic unity while striving for a breadth of material that will constantly entertain the listener.  My favorite track is &quot;A Better Future&quot;, and if it's not released as a single, I will be shocked.
B000000OS2|3.0|Recorded at Trocadero Club in Philladelphia on July 2 1990, Five Man Acoustical Jam is - from my personal point of view- a precursor and probably the musical idea that generated the &quot;unplugged&quot; concept which would be developed by you know who shortly afterwards.<BR>Tesla delivers an acoustical set, if not brilliant, adequate and well performed. The best tracks are the obvious hits &quot;Modern Day Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;. Due to the lack of musical background - at that time- of the band, Tesla intelligently supports the show with pleasant acoustic versions of rock classics such as the Rolling Stones &quot;Mother Little Helper&quot;, CCRs &quot;Lodi&quot; and prominently &quot;Signs&quot; originally recorded by the obscure act Five Man Electrical Band which became the albums major hit.<BR>Five Man Acoustical Jam in short, is an enjoyable record without big pretension. The ideal CD to listen to on any given hot summer afternoon with a cold six pack next to your favorite couch.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This is an amazing recording.  Being an avid NIN and Depeche Mode fan, and a newbie when it comes to country music, I was kind of skeptical about Mr. Cash covering songs from these bands.  He has done a remarkable job.  Now, these songs are very stripped down, so don't expect them to sound exactly like the originals.  Johnny Cash has made them his own, and has done a wonderful job of it.  In doing so, he has shown tremendous respect for the original artists, while still expressing the emotions that he wants to portray.<BR>The disc is consistently good.  I work in a cd store and I recommend this title all the time.  If you like it, try the others in the American series.
1587990717|2.0|I can't remember the last time I've found a book so frustrating. The idea that society and our internal wiring combine to make us see significance where there's really only randomness is a topic that isn't written about nearly enough.  This book, though, just combines a lot self-regard with a few anecdotes and ideas.  This isn't a textbook, it's true, but it would have been easy for the author to support his claims with concrete numeric examples.  He does this a few times, such as the well-known birthday &quot;paradox&quot; or the example copied from Deborah Bennett's (much better) book &quot;Randomness&quot;.  But in general, his examples aren't in the least bit mathematical and tend to be overburdened with pseudo-intellectual remarks.  Do the author's repeated claims of contempt for TV and the media or his attraction to classics and poetry really matter at all?  At one point, he makes the claim that watching TV takes more energy for him than writing a book.  I believe it, but not for the reason he had in mind.
B00006IUL7|4.0|The movie was ok. You gotta love the smart remarks you get from Al. Al Pacino was great in this movie. He goes to Alaska to help with a murder case and of course it's gotta be during the 6 months of light, so he's having a hard time sleeping (hence the name Insomnia). He has a couple run in's with the killer. I don't want to give any parts of the movie away, that's the reason for being vague. And The ending was pretty good. You wouldn't really think that what happens is going to happen.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The first one hour and fifty minutes of this movie are brilliant, and evocative of Kubrick's bleak social commentary softened with Spielberg optimism. Many reviewers find the movie chops excessively but I thought the change of pace worked well, after a fairly slow start.<br />A.I. explores the moral dilemma of creating beings with human capacities in a complex and intelligent way, it is a thought provoking film. The special effects are dazzling and the vision of the future is realised beautifully.<br />But there is a big problem. At around one hour and fifty minutes the film ends. It ends clearly. It ends with what is called a tragic ending. Don't be frightened folks, the ancient Greeks used to have these all the time, and European directors are known to produce them still. So why is it seemingly impossible for Hollywood? After the film ends it surprises us by continuing. It keeps going for a half hour of the biggest cop out I have ever seen, and there is no doubt in my mind that this is all Spielberg. Its pretty to look at, but the sweetness is all saccharin.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|This movie really was not that great. It was really slow. I mean its about a bachelor trying to get women. And he decides that women with kids are the way to go, so he goes to a single parents meeting and lies to everyone about having a son. and That does not last too long. A couple people catch on to his scheme. And he meets this kid that gets picked on in school and this kid goes to his house like everyday because his mother is suicidal and does not understand or have any clue whats going on. blah blah, then the movie ends and its not even a great ending either. Overall, the movie is not that good. It's kind of boring.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Although I do not own the DVD of this film I saw it in theatres and was pretty impressed. One of the reasons I saw it was because it supposedly had one of the best car chase scenes in years. It was great because it did not try to imitate Bond or Lethal Weapon style chases but was more reminiscent of the realistic car chases scene from the french connection. The storyline of the movie may not be so believable but the fight scenes and even the romance aspect of the film was well done. When I saw the book by Robert Ludlum in the store I didn't intend to read it but when I saw that it was actually a novel that the film was based on instead of a novelization of the film I decided to give it a [look]. The storyline is similar for the first half, except for the fact that the book is set in 1975, but by the end the two had no recognizable similarities. That's why I am very eager to purchase the DVD and see what the alternate ending is. I would reccomend both the novel and the DVD.
B000001DV2|4.0|I've been a Def Lep fan since I was a kid, and their music has had an influence over a lot of musicians...This was their first album that was released after the death of Steve Clark, although most of it was written while he was still alive. It's as sweet as sugar (pardon the pun)and all 10 tracks have a great feel...the album still put out quite a few singles. Highlights are \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" and \\"White Lightning\\". The guitar work of Phill Collen was incredibly impressive as he handled all of the guitar duties. If you listen closely you can always hear about three or four guitars doing different parts in the songs. Although not as successful as Pyromania or Hysteria, Adrenalize belongs in any rock collection.
B000005H7D|5.0|John Coltrane was a monster of the tenor sax as early as 1955, when he first joined Miles Davis' band.  An overachiever, Coltrane had a relentless and unvarying passion for practice, for improving his skills as an artist.  As he progressed through his quite legendary career, he never ceased to amaze.<br />BLUE TRAIN (1957) is a classic; an album often heralded as one of the greatest records of the 1950s by fans and jazz educators alike.  It gives the listener a very clear view of what made these musicians so great.  You will notice things like Coltrane's (and pianist Kenny Drew's) tasteful and masterful usage of the blues scale in the chant-like title cut.  Many musicians have the tendency to drive that scale into the ground when playing the blues.  Not so here: these guys were well beyond that sort of thing.  On Jerome Kern's &quot;I'm Old Fashioned,&quot; you will hear Coltrane's (or was it Kenny Drew's?) ascending-stepwise reharmonization.  The Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller solos on &quot;Locomotion&quot; are a delight, but that's true of the entire album.<br />It is well known that the Coltrane composition &quot;Giant Steps&quot; (released in 1959) is a bear to play, to improvise on the changes.  But, even here, Coltrane was writing tunes that could shake a few people up.  &quot;Moment's Notice&quot; is one such tune.  It has an ABAC structure (8 bars, 8 bars, 8 bars, 14 bars: a total of 38 bars for one time through)--hard enough to follow--along with a barrage of formidable chord changes.  Some say the song got its name when Curtis Fuller asked, &quot;You expect me to play these changes at a moment's notice?&quot;<br />BLUE TRAIN is certainly deserving of being hailed as a &quot;classic,&quot; a term grossly overused these days.  Imagination or creativity doesn't always come in the form of extreme busyness, and if you give this album your full attention, it will offer riches galore.  There is good reason why BLUE TRAIN is listed on many a jazz educator's essential recordings list:  It IS essential.  (Seeing that this reissue gives you all the bonus extras for just a few bucks more, I can't see going for the earlier one.)<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayal recordings list:  It IS essential.  (Seeing that this reissue gives you all the bonus extras for just a few bucks more, I can't see going for the earlier one.)<br />Cheers,<BR>Murray
B00004YTZE|5.0|I had this album on vinyl as a kid, and played the [...] out of it.  I saw it was now on cd and just had to buy it.  Its still great, and has influenced so many musicians over the years such as:  The Jones, The Humpers, 8 Foot Tender, etc.  If you own a New York Doll album, buy this one too.  Also check out Johnny's So Alone album.
0783230621|5.0|I have just seen this movie, and it was just great! Special Effects were perfect-The lava looked like lava, the ash looked like ash-and even more so to me since I'm studying volcanoes and can say 'Hey! I know that!' When some scientific mumbo-jumbo comes on. Even if you don't know all your volcanic vocab, the visual and sound effects teaches itself. The pyroclastic flow was amazing, and I was really impressed. And except for once or twice, it was totally believable. None of the actors ruined it with wooden acting, but they seemed to go exactly along with the story! Best disaster film EVER!
0316666343|4.0|I read tons of reviews before I read the book. It is a beautiful text...however, it does have some problems. I found it to be facsinating at the beginning. The middle drags a bit.<br />The bottome line is...if you enjoy thought-provoking books, you will love it.  I wished she would have explored the killer's life more...and spent more time on the girl's life in heaven...but overall, it is certianly worth the read.<br />Hope this helps.

B000059XUP|4.0|I realize this movie is seven years old, but I was surfing the net and happened to see that Crow City of Angels was on television, so I thought I'd put in some positive words for this film. This is like the 20th time I've watched it. First of all, you have to forget THE CROW. It has no ties to the first one, it's a completely original character and story. It goes without saying, the first one is better. THE CROW is my favorite movie of all time. This movie is not bad though. It received so many negative reviews from critics however, which is too bad, because it is a very good movie. Vincent Perez does a wonderful job portraying Ashe; a man murdered along with his son, Danny, after witnessing a murder. Sarah (the litte girl from the first movie) returns in City of Angels, played by Mia Kirshner, to look after Ashe. Judah, played by Richard Brooks, doesn't even come close to Top Dollar, who was the main villain in the first movie, but he's ok. Judah does have one of the film's best lines though, when Ashe tells him to go to hell and he says \\"Already been there, and I must confess, I like what I saw.\\"<br /> The dark and dreadful mood is still wonderfully intact, which I love. The look of this film is just as good as the first. There are so many great moments in this movie that I can never forget, such as when Sarah paints Ashe's face with Danny's old paints, the part where Ash pulls Curve's body out into the water and flowers surround him in the form of a crow, and the unforgettable ending when Judah is destroyed. It's classic. Another great aspect of this movie is how Ash mocks the words of the killers - what they said just before they killed him and his son - just before he kills them.<br /> I think most people never even wanted to give this movie a chance because of what happened to Brandon Lee, and that's understandable but at the same time a shame because a great talent was passed over in Vincent Perez, and a great movie as well.
B000002J29|5.0|This is the CD I would give anyone who, after hearing any of the 80s-90s era Genesis music, and wondered if &quot;that was all&quot;.<br />Considering this was Phil Collins' first live album as the new lead singer of Genesis, he really shone and for those who were fans of the Peter Gabrial era of Genesis, made them realize &quot;Hey the future of this group is really bright.&quot;<br />From quirky songs like Squonk, to masterpieces like &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; and &quot;Dance on the Volcano&quot; you can really appriciate the depth of this group and just how good these guys really were. I've had this CD since late 1999 and it remains one of my favorite disks. With so many songs muuuuch longer than the usual 3-5 minutes. Supper's Ready is a whopping 20 some odd minutes long. You really get your money's worth on this set. In an age when we're given 2 CD sets that have maybe 1 disk of good stuff and the second disk is just garbage filler. This is 2 disks of pure gold. <br />The sound is nice and pure and if you have a good set of speakers or headphones, you can pick up all the little nuances that set this disk apart from any other live album. And for a  live CD, you're not subjected to lots of &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh&quot;ing and clapping and cheering after every song. There are few of those, but it's almost like listening to a studio album or if they gave a private concert that was recorded. <br />This is worth every penny and a must have for ANY Genesis, Phil Collins or Peter Gabrial fan!
0684800713|5.0|It would be difficult (if not unbelievable) to claim one is a student of the American novel and not have read Hemingway. And then . . . .read him again.<br />I think there are more enjoyable books. Social maladies and the concept of being \\"lost\\" neither began nor ended in the post World War I era. Lost generations do seem to follow a war. The Civil War for example produced enormous social discontent, and certainly the foolishness called Vietnam produced a generation of, if not lost, hopelessly confused men and women. (Have you seen some of our pictures from 1969?)<br />So while he was drawn to post war Paris, that venue for the odd mix of abusive characters may become irrelevant, knowing what we know now.<br />Having said that, I think that there are two reasons we treat Hemingway with awe. You ever try to write like him? I mean it's a simple paragraph. Staccato thinking. Bang bang bang. Economy of prose. Tightness of verbiage. Compression of thought. Read the extraordinary sentences of him in the Cathedral. Or fly fishing in Spain. Simple, or so it appears. But then try to replicate it. It's nearly impossible.<br />The other point is Hemingway's disguised repetition. He tells us something. Then in a different city, with different characters, forty pages later, he tells us the same thing.<br />Ecclesiastes tells us on page one what the story is about, everything changes, only to repeat itself:  \\"unto the place from [where] the rivers come . . . .they return again.\\"<br />I feel every character speaks for every character. Mike's bankruptcy represents all of their bankruptcy, financial and otherwise; Jake's frustrations are all of their frustrations; Brett's promiscuity not only speaks to all of them, she needs all of them.<br />John Donne's line about the bell tolling for all of us rings true. A brilliant, brilliant book. You may not care for the story but you can't escape Hemingway.
0312305060|5.0|Although I rated this book one of my favorites of all time IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.<br />SO...<br />Do not buy this book if: <BR>-You do not like highly-nuanced texts<BR>-You are homophobic <BR>-You prefer action-packed, in-your-face messages and themes<br />DO read this book if:<BR>-You have seen the movie and enjoyed it<BR>-You enjoy the work of Virginia Wolf<BR>-You are able to \\"get\\" and enjoy dark, enigmatic plotting and theme exploration<br />My personal review: I read the book and saw the movie and loved both equally. The film is brilliant and rounds out the book beautifully. Kidman, Moore, and Ed Harris each give powerful, perfect performances in their leading roles. Alison Janey, Toni Collette, Claire Daines, and Jeff Daniels are equally as powerful in supporting roles. It is Streep however, as usual, who really carries the film. She is, beyond doubt, the most capable actress ever to appear on film. There are moments in the movie where you literally cannot believe how someone can consistently give an audience such amazingly real and unbelievingly touching performances. <br />The book is brilliantlly written and the movie is a perfect compliment to the book.<br />This book taught me that: 1) happiness is about collective moments and hours, not days and years; 2) people die so that others may more appreciate life and 3) we all must begin to stare life honestly in the face in order to ever really learn to be happy.<br />I absolutely loved this book. Hope you do too. <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B00007L4OM|5.0|I just saw this yesterday, on a foreign DVD, and it was FAN-TAS-TIC!!!  I've always believed that anything with Jean Reno in it can't be all THAT bad, (ok maybe except Just Visiting). Wasabi has got the pulse-pounding techno beats of the Replacement Killers, the comedy of the Visitors (French), and the colors of the Fifth Element!  Luc Besson was smart to put his seal of approval on this!  The acting from both Jean Reno, and the young girl played by Ryoko Hirosue, is wonderful and you really believe the characters.  The arcade scene is GREAT!  You'll have to see it to believe that Mr. Reno CAN dance...ok maybe not...but, it's still funny!  This is a must see for any Hong Kong action fan who also loves Jean Reno's past films (Mission Impossible, The Visitors, & Ronin).  Definitely worth buying!!!
B000002J1O|5.0|If you're looking a CD that will show you the best of Genesis, this is THE CD to have. The lush soundscapes and quasi baroque/classical elements of songs like Dancing With the Moonlit Knight and Firth of Fith make you wonder &quot;am I listening to a rock album?&quot; <br />The drum and fife band before &quot;Battle of Epping Forest&quot; is a fun kinda opening, I don't think any other rock band has used that before in the opening of a song. The highly intelligable lyrics sung by Peter Gabrial on all the songs really makes you wonder &quot;These guys were only in thier 20s?&quot;<br />Everytime I listen to this disk, I am blown away at how mature and deep and just plain GOOD it is. This is adult rock, every instrument is used to its best effect, there are no 'thrash' guitars in here, no drowning drums, or wailing. If you want music with a touch of the intellectual and class, then grab this CD TODAY. It's not &quot;fuddy duddy old stuff&quot; it's just GOOD ROCK! Some younger people may not appriciate it, but if they take the time to listen to it, the precision and sound that came out of a bunch of 20 somethings over 20 years ago... will make you greedy for more!<br />Sure, More Fool Me is a bit slow and some consider it nothing special, but I think it has heart and considering the depth of Firth of Fith it's a nice &quot;let's take things down a bit&quot; before Battle of Epping Forest where things really pick up.<br />The sound clips here don't do the album justice. If you buy it, you won't regret it. After a long day of work you'll find yourself popping this CD in and just getting lost in the melody and the world it creates.
B00006V9A0|5.0|i love nirvana, but dont you think it is a little odd on how there newest song starts out, i will never bother you, i will never promise to, i will never follow you, i will never bother you, never speak a word again, i will crawl away for good. i mean this is the last song we ever got to hear from kurt, dave, and krist, and in a way it is like a last explanation of why kurt did what he did, (even though his whole suicide is still sketchy to me - check out the video kurt and courtney if you want my opinion - also avaliable now) just a little ironic i guess and i had to share buy the album it is a classic peace and love
0151008116|5.0|One character of the book says that the novel is a 'story that will make you believe in God'. From my point of view this is a genuine statement but not a plain one. Ages and ages ago the biblical Book of Job formulated one of the most complex problem of human life - sufferings of a righteous man, and best writers and philosophers of all times and countries have tried to solve (or at least explain) it since - W.Shakespeare, F.Dostoevsky, C.S.Lewis and S.Kierkegaard, to name only the most outstanding figures among many others. Afflictions of sinful man often lead him to God but tribulations of right man can lead in both directions - to denial (F.Nitzsche) or to strengthening of faith (Job and Pi).<br />The first part of the novel is a story of befores and afters of hero's ordeal: a good-humor version of Pi's life in India at a place that really was a zoo, of his spiritual search for true faith (he attracts 'religions the way a dog attracts fleas'), printed in normal type, is mixed with flashes of his present life in Canada, printed in italics. Narratives in both sections are meaningly placid save some inklings (e.g., 'The evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of public arena but the small clearing of each heart', an allusion to well-known Dostoevsky's opinion) . The second part of the novel is a between, a description of the ordeal - a shipwreck and 227-days trek in the Pacific Ocean that change Pi's life profoundly and forever. It is a wonderful story about a human being and a beast that found themselves in one lifeboat and are forced to live together. But some fantastic elements in description of event (especially the island of algae) disturb our understanding and generate additional questions.<br />The third part of the novel, its pinnacle and clue to understanding, gives a true perspective of the events. The shortest part of the novel, it is a recorded interrogation of Pi concerning thecauses of the shipwreck. Be not deceived: masterly constructed dialogue will provoke smiles (especially in English interpretation of its Japanese parts) but eight pages of Pi's alternative story will harrow your soul and force you to think about this book long after you have read the last page. The young pious and righteous man does not pass his ocean ordeal but his faith gives him power not to sink in quagmire of despair and ruin his life. Like biblical Isaac in Soren Kierkegaard's interpretation ('Fear and Trembling') Pi lives nearly in silence, studying theology (and zoology), taking care of his new family and pets and trying to understand God's will and voluntarily accept it. <br />Several words about novel's ordonnance. The structure of Yann Martel's book is exquisite: the author uses 'story inside story' technique which was so effectively used recently by best writers  ('The Blind Assassin' by M.Atwood and 'Atonement' by I.McEwan are the most prominent examples).  It gives possibility to give the plot bolt-from-the-blue quality comparable only with psycological thriller.<br />'Life of Pi' by Yann Martel, the winner of the Man Booker Prize 2002, is one of the best novels I've read in the last three years, an absolutely must-read.
B000002NHN|5.0|Who would not want to read a book of secrets...Except, this is one you listen to.<br /><br />\\"The journey not the destination, becomes a source of wonder.\\"<br /><br />Loreena McKennitt spent a few years thinking about Celtic nomadic ways. She wondered if this need arose from an insatiable curiosity. She set off to travel to Rome and ended up in Istanbul. She set off for Japan and ended up on a train across Siberia. The CD booklet, is interesting to read as you listen and reveals her sources of inspiration. Of course after reading the booklet, you might feel compelled to go off on your own journey<br /><br />The songs on this album are all a reflection of Loreena's knowledge of the world. She seems to be seeking, exploring possibilities and expressing what she has captured.<br /><br />1. Prologue - inspired by \\"From The Holy Mountain\\" by William Dalrymple. There is a certain emptiness and remorse woven into this piece. Maybe a longing for what could have been. You can almost imagine monks traveling from monastery to monastery to collect ancient wisdom.<br /><br />2. The Mummers' Dance - Loreena incorporated the chorus of a traditional mumming song and her words take on new meaning when you realize that mumming involves a group of performers who dress up in masks and clothes bedecked with ribbons and carrying branches of greenery. This \\"mumming\\" has its roots in tree worshiping, which will make you consider why you bring a tree in at Christmas time, at least it is worth considering. Although I think people are more interested in worshipping materialism at the malls.<br /><br />3. Skellig - this song becomes almost hypnotic as it seems to spin in circles or maybe it is more like the flicker of a candle that grows brighter as you approach it on a dark night.<br /><br />4. Marco Polo - Loreena has interwoven an authentic Sulfi melody at the beginning and middle of this piece. It is rather intoxicating.<br /><br />5. The Highwayman - friends suggested setting Alfred Noyes' poem \\"The Highwayman\\" to music. While in the studio, Loreena imagined the sound of horses galloping down a moonlit lane. Best to listen to this song while reading the lyrics, which are included and paint a tragic tale even more dramatically in song.<br /><br />6. La Serenissima - Delicate and haunting.<br /><br />7. Night Ride Across the Caucasus - the notes explain how people are affected by music and either hear the spiritual meaning or the material sound.<br /><br />\\"In the velvet of the darkness<br />By the silhouette of silent trees<br />They are watching, they are waiting<br />They are witnessing life's mysteries.\\"<br /><br />8. Dante's Prayer - inspired by Dante's The Divine Comedy (a vernacular poem in 100 cantos), Loreena thinks about the human condition and how we all want to believe there is a place better than our own. An almost sorrowful and yet hopeful melody. Italian poet, Dante (1265-1321) gave an explanation of what happens after we die and this question is still just as controversial today.<br /><br />Perhaps she was inspired by: \\"Temo di perder viver tra coloro, che questo tempo chiameranno Antico.\\" (I fear I will lose life among those who will call this time ancient.\\" She sings \\"Please remember me.\\" She also speaks of \\"Beyond the ice and the fire.\\" The innermost pit of hell is for Dante, ice. The dark woods implies the present state of mankind and when you think about this while listening, the words suddenly become more meaningful.<br /><br />I found this CD to be an expression of continuing knowledge. Knowledge from the past flows through Loreena McKennitt's consciousness and turns into music. It is an evolution of travel and contemplation. Through her experiences, music evolves into moments of pure beauty.<br /><br />Inspirational and Deeply Calming.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Revieworeena imagined the sound of horses galloping down a moonlit lane. Best to listen to this song while reading the lyrics, which are included and paint a tragic tale even more dramatically in song.     6. La Serenissima - Delicate and haunting.    7. Night Ride Across the Caucasus - the notes explain how people are affected by music and either hear the spiritual meaning or the material sound.     \\"In the velvet of the darkness  By the silhouette of silent trees  They are watching, they are waiting  They are witnessing life's mysteries.\\"     8. Dante's Prayer - inspired by Dante's The Divine Comedy (a vernacular poem in 100 cantos), Loreena thinks about the human condition and how we all want to believe there is a place better than our own. An almost sorrowful and yet hopeful melody. Italian poet, Dante (1265-1321) gave an explanation of what happens after we die and this question is still just as controversial today.     Perhaps she was inspired by: \\"Temo di perder viver tra coloro, che questo tempo chiameranno Antico.\\" (I fear I will lose life among those who will call this time ancient.\\" She sings \\"Please remember me.\\" She also speaks of \\"Beyond the ice and the fire.\\" The innermost pit of hell is for Dante, ice. The dark woods implies the present state of mankind and when you think about this while listening, the words suddenly become more meaningful.     I found this CD to be an expression of continuing knowledge. Knowledge from the past flows through Loreena McKennitt's consciousness and turns into music. It is an evolution of travel and contemplation. Through her experiences, music evolves into moments of pure beauty.     Inspirational and Deeply Calming.    ~The Rebecca Review
B000002UZ4|5.0|Wow I love this CD! Their best work and very catchy. I can't stop listening to West End Girls, Domino Dancing, Suburbia, Alright, and some of the others. I totally recommend this cd if you're a huge fan or if you're just in love with a few of their songs. It's a highly addictive dance cd that will rock your world.
B00006RAKP|3.0|Great, only negative is that, unlike the Rolling Stones reissue, it does not have an SACD layer.
B00001ZSZX|4.0|Uriah Heep may be under rated in many ways. \\"Firefly\\" is a very good album and the opening \\"The hanging tree\\" should be regarded a (hard) rock classic. This song alone is well worth the money. The song writing is good and the singing is excellent. Other outstanding tunes are \\"Wise man\\", \\"Rollin' on\\" and \\"Sympathy\\". This reminds of a time when the music climate was much better than it is these days...<br />This must be regarded as a highlight in Heep's career!
B0000640SA|5.0|This DVD set is awesome.  It is the coolest looking set I have ever bought.  Not only that but Memento is a great movie that you have to watch 3 or 4 times to really get (and then watch it backwards to go deeper).  The only gripe I have is the menu of the DVD.  Its cool and everything but its like hell trying to navigate the menu (it's a series of psychological tests and depending on your answer to the questions, you go to a different segment of the DVD features).  But a must-buy for movie fans, especially those of you that like movies like 12 Monkeys or The Matrix...this is a movie that could conceivably screw you up pretty bad and leave you saying &quot;Huh?&quot;.  Buy it soon.
B000067CPX|2.0|As much as i wish it weren't true, it's definitely a let down. I absolutely hated it at first, searching desperately for funk in any shape or form, but it grows on you if you're persistent and listen to it a lot. And i mean a lot. If you're not a fan, check out ANY of their other albums - Californication, One Hot Minute, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mother's Milk, and Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which are all among the GREATEST albums of all time. Hopefully they'll rediscover that which has made them the greatest band on earth in the near future. But if you're a fan i say go for it, you'll find something you'll appreciate.
6305878323|5.0|My 4 year old son, 2 1/2 year old son and 1 year old daughter all enjoy this film.  They mainly enjoy the singing but my 4 year old is able to get some of the jokes.  A nice video for family movie night since it is not scary or too fast paced.
B00000IMTE|5.0|\\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\" is the best Rainbow album ever, and it's also one of the best rock albums of all time. The material is top quality. Leaving Deep Purple and hooking up with Ronnie James Dio was clearly the best alternative for Blackmore as well as for the music world. This album is vital and it seems that it was a fuel injection for both Blackmore and Dio (ex Elf). Listen to \\"Man on the silver mountain\\", \\"Self portrait\\", and \\"Temple of the king\\" and you'll discover that you won't find anything equally great these days. My only objection is that the last track \\"Still I'm sad\\" is instrumental since there is an alternative version with lyric - a real gem!
0451196716|5.0|a story about a boy who, like many others agreed to take a walk.  not just any walk but a walk where if you fall back far enough..they kill you.  the characers are great and the story if riveting.  i could not put this one down.  if you like king, or just want something different, then you have found a good one.
B000067J1Y|5.0|This movie was good, and hilarious. This first installment in the Hot Shots! series is hilarious. The gags in this movie range from the subtle like the guys dancing out the window when Lloyd Bridges character(Admiral Benson I think) is talking, to the outlandish like the incredible stretchiness of Topper's dad. I'm sure many critics dismiss this as a mindless spoof, but I think a lot of thought and effort went in to it. It's totally Sweet, and the next one in the series is even better.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|If this CD doesn't have your bowels a-shakin', you are probably in a casket.
B000066NW0|5.0|Frankly, I loved this album.  For a debut, she did pretty well.  Good vocals, good writing, good production.  I don't compare her to a Britney or Christina.  I think she has a style all her own, and if this album is any indication of the type of work we'll expect from her in the future, she'll definately rock for a long time to come.
0451197968|4.0|this was so different from the movie, thank god.  it is a story about a society out of control and the tv game shows head the pack.  one man gets fed up and takes matters into his own hands.  if you think this is the movie, you are misguided.  do not assume anything.  the end is different(i did not like the ending and thats why i only gave it 4 starts.  also i liked the long walk better and i gave that 5 stars) as are many other twists.  a good read.  took me one week.  short, sweet and to the point.
0151008116|5.0|Because of my job schedule these days, I mostly get to read just prior to falling asleep, after I get home at 2am.  This usually means I read my books in 20 minute chunks, and it takes awhile!!  LIFE OF PI was consumed in four nights of sleeplessness.  It is a fascinating book with an absolutely outstanding, sympathetic central character.  The setup is intruiquing:  Youth is shipwrecked and set adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger for companionship.  I imagined a touching story of the bond growing between Pi and the tiger (named Richard Parker).<br />This is NOT the case at all...and yet the direction the book takes in much more interesting.  First, the book takes its time letting us get to know the character, who lives in India and is the son of a zookeeper.  He is very religious, choosing to follow Christianity, Islam and Hindu all at the same time.  He also has a name that his classmates make fun of...Piscene.  He demands that it be shortened to Pi.<br />Anyway, when he is cast adrift, we're already totally in this kid's spell, and his ordeal is unbelievably gripping.  How he evaluates the tools he has at hand, how he deals with this Tiger on his boat...it's all great.  Is the tiger tame, you might ask?  Well, let's just say that the voyage starts out with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and a tiger.  Within days, we're only dealing with a Tiger.  You be the judge!<br />His journey is very long, and it begins to get a bit weird towards the end, and we begin to doubt his sanity or perceptions or something.  I have to admit the ending was a bit of a let down. I guess I expected something more conventional and less up-in-the-air.  But the ending is fair, in its way, you just have to be willing to adjust your frame of reference to the book.  Even with a modest let down at the end, it is still one of the best books I've read in YEARS.  And I read a lot!  You've never read anything like it.  It's also a fast read, and I think would be great for youth (say 14 and above) to read.  Should be a classic.ve) to read.  Should be a classic.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The mafia. If you ever did business with one of these people, you would either wind up dead or with much less money in your pocket. These people would not make ideal friends, but one thing remains for sure: the mafia is freakin' cool. <BR>        From Hollywood's colorless beginning, filmmakers have been fascinated with the idea of a private organization capable of running the entire government. Films like \\"Public Enemy\\" defined the genre, and ever since, filmmakers have strived to capture this dangerous yet intriguing lifestyle.<BR>        \\"The Godfather,\\" a film by Francis Ford Coppola, is undisputedly the best mafia film. In fact, movie fans have voted this 1972 film their #1 movie of all time on imdb.com. Why is this movie so great?<BR>         First of all; it's just darn good filmmaking. It captures 1930's New York in such a superb fashion that it might as well been filmed in that era. The script, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo (who also wrote the book), is wonderful. Coppola also perfects the art of directing with this film. <BR>         The cast; oh the cast! Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and James Cann are all in this one film, who could ask for more? (If you were to want more, however, you will be glad to know that Robert DeNiro plays a key role in Part II). This is possibly the most talented group of actors ever assembled in a film, and it shows. Their own identity is washed completely away when they are on screen. The acting is just that good.<BR>        Even if all the above elements were in place, \\"The Godfather\\" would only be a sub-par movie if it wasn't for a great story. And hot-diggity-dog, is it a great story. <BR>        This movie does not create a genre; it expands and perfects one. Unlike many mob movies, the characters in \\"The Godfather\\" are not 2-dimensional. Although they are not of the nicest of people, they are still human. In the Corleone family, around which the film is centered, family values are very important. <BR>        This is hypocritical, for the adults in the family make their living by invoking fear and death in their community. This impossible balance between morality and greed is very real in \\"The Godfather.\\" Throughout the film, its characters are in constant internal battle to try to retain some sort of moral ground. This internal battle is mixed with the external battle of the mob world, and its results provide film lovers with an unbelievably powerful movie.<BR>        There is also a form of this wonderful story in paper and ink. Although \\"The Godfather,\\" the book was the basis for the film, the film is the full realization of the story of the Corleone family. Puzo, the author, not only helped write the screenplay for \\"The Godfather,\\" but also for \\"The Godfather Part II\\" and \\"The Godfather Part III.\\" These films provide a full scope of the rise and fall of a powerful mob family, whereas the book only gives a glimpse. <BR>        Is \\"The Godfather\\" worth seeing? Without a doubt. In fact, it's worth buying and possibly even memorizing. Its successors, especially \\"The Godfather Part II,\\" contain an awe-inspiring greatness that will not be found in many, if any, other films. The \\"Godfather\\" films should not be missed by any human being. They are simply that great.
0792839730|4.0|When I was ten years of age, my mother's uncle gave me his copy of Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far book. This was a very special gift from him, since he has been deported to Germany to work for the Reich during WWII and never recovered mentaly from what had happened to him. At the time I got the book, he was living in a small village, some miles west of Arnhem, on the southbank of the Rijn river. Obvious, I was to young to read the book at that time.<br />Over the years my interest in WWII and operation Market Garden started to grow, and every time A Bridge Too Far was broadcast, I watched it. The scenes depicting the drops of the paratroopers and the Waal river assault were the ones mostly remembered. That, and the great musical score by John Addison.<br />I finaly bought the DVD, and watched it a few times since. I must say that with every time I watch it, the movie gets better and better. Especially with the close captions: first those specifying at which location we are. Without these, one could get confused at where the viewer was brought from one scene to another. Secondly, since English is not my native language, I got to understand some of the dialogues more better. (Finaly got to understand what Liv was trying to say in Dutch =)<br />The widescreen option is fantastic. You really get into the battle scenes and to see all the extra imagery... for example when John Frost's batalion is entering Arnhem, you see people riding on bikes in the background, which you can't see in the pan and scan version.<br />But with such a great medium as DVD, and also with the movies 25th anniversary last year, MGM and United Artists missed out on a great chance. It is a shame the only extra is the original theatrical trailer. I really would have liked to see extra behind the scene footage included on a second disc. The Dutch Broadcasting Company (NOS) must have a lot of file footage, I remember the news broadcast often spending time on the filming on the movie, such as the re-enacted droppings. Beside that footage, the studio must have extra footage as well. They could even produce a new documantary on filming this movie, including interviews with the main actors and Sir Richard Attenborough. And how about original footage and notes on the battle as it took place?<br />Despite this miss, it is still a must buy if you're into war and/or classic movies. After 25 years it still holds it's own, and still is a thrill to watch. Buy it, and meanwhile keep hoping for a DVD special edition.<br />I give this DVD 4 stars, but if they had included the extra material, it would easily get 5 stars!
B00006CXXU|4.0|if you look at my [Amazon.com] profile, especially my reviews, i am pretty much a heavy rock fan but i am not content to stay in one thing.  yes i love korn and such but i also appreciate and love tori amos.  it is out of this desire for every style of music that I borrowed my wife's cd of christina and listened.  and i mean REALLY and honestly listened.  i found a truly funky and soulful artist who has dropped the hype and made an album on her own terms.  i love fighter especially dave navaros rockin riff as well as the funky dancines of dirrrty.  they both really groove and are great to dance to.  <BR>     it is not shocking to find that linda perry had a hand here and did for christina what she did for pink.  each song may sound the same to the casual observer but i find each song is its own universe and can be many things all at once.  if your looking for something different or something genuine then drop all your pretenses and REALLY listen to this album and forget what you know about xtina.  it is pop music without the hype, pop music drenched in soul, r&b, and many other styles to give this album a unique feel.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This isn't supposed to be the deepest most dramatic cd of the century. It was meant to be light hearted and sensitive. His lyrics describe the way normal people usually feel. I know i don't go around spouting poetry and deep sentiments. it's nice to listen to someone who talks like a real human being. great cd, very chill.
B000062YB1|5.0|If I could give this more than 5,I would,Its catchy,Heavy,Amazing,No TRUE Slayer fan can deny this cd,forget God Hates Us All and Devine Intervention,Its all about Hell Awaits,Reign in Blood,South of Heaven,Seasons in the Abyss!!!!.
B00005JKL8|3.0|In \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\", Owen Wilson stars as Lt. Chris Burnett, a Naval Aviator shot down in Bosnia and on the run from the murderous, genocidal Bosnia army.  Gene Hackman is his supperior/father figure, Adm. Leslie Reigart.  Hackman guides and comforts Wilson as he attempts to make his way to a safe landing zone where he can be picked up and flown to safety.  Along the way, Wilson's character discovers that Muslims are still being slaughtered by the Bosnian Army in the so-called DMZ.  Besides the army looking for him, Wilson must also escape from the lethal sniper known only as \\"The Tracker\\", who isn't much of a shot and is easily fooled.  The film itself is ludicrus.  There is no way that any of this could possibly happen.  But that does not stop it from being entertaining.<br />What makes this film work is the utter determination of it's stars to take it seriously.  They say their lines with absolute conviction, not going through the motions or hamming it up.  With a plot like this, hammy acting, which admittedly has it's place in implausible action films, would have ruined it.  These actors believe in what they're saying and doing.  And it actually adds drama to a film that would have none if the actors didn't at least TRY to convey seriousness.  Casting Wilson and Hackman was briliant, as was the casting of David Keith as Reigarts top aide.  These men will not let the movie collapse around them.  Keith never met a bad line he couldn't deliver with utter conviction.  These three make the dramatic scenes work.  Wilson seems appropriately disoriented as a pilot who wanted action in his missions but wasn't prepared for it.  He's clumsy on the ground and not thinking straight most of the time.  He conveys this well.  It is now my belief that it is impossible for Gene Hackman to give a bad performance.  He is at least good in everything he does.  While he is only good here, he's still a commanding presence.<br />The action scenes are also well made.  The downing of the plane is one of the best made jet action sequences since \\"Top Gun\\".  It is exciting and tense, and it is a testament to the director's ability.  Wilson's journey through a ruined Bosnia also has some excellent action scenes, such as the attack on the city of Haj, and a harrowing moment in a mine field, in which the director shows some flair.  I won't give away the secrets of the totally absurd final actions scene, but say what you will about realisim, it's fun and exciting.<br />The film, upon release in late 2001, was criticized for being too rah-rah American, for being jingoistic.  That is unfair.  Why must the US being successful militarliy always be called Jingoistic?  Is it because NATO wants to keep the American's from succeeding?  I will say it is rah-rah American, but not so awful that it's jingoistic.  There's no real message in this movie, other than genocide is bad and america's military will kick you butt.<br />In the end, it's only an OK movie, but it's not a disaster.  I had fun watching it.  Suspend your disbelief and enjoy.the plane is one of the best made jet action sequences since \\"Top Gun\\".  It is exciting and tense, and it is a testament to the director's ability.

B00004TJKI|1.0|Anatomy of a Murder is the worst court room drama I have seen.  jimmy Stewart must be spinning in his grave whenever someone watches it.  An amature movie when compared to any other court room centered drama, ...
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the best film I have seen in a long time. Not only is it laugh out loud funny, but also touches the heart in a non-mooshy way. I loved the film so much, I watched it back to back two days in a row. My husband loved it too. It has the perfect recipe for humor, love and learning some of life's most precious learnings. I highly recommend this movie.
B0000634EV|5.0|(my observations after listening to this album for a few months now) great album.  A definite southern feel to it.  The album has a good consistent feel and listening appeal throughout the album.  They do a great job on blending the heavier songs in between the softer/more acoustic songs.  The vocals and lyrics add a nice dark feel, I love the job Phil does on this album.  The drums are great and not too overpowering in presence.  On that note, all the instruments and vocals blend together well.  Overall, this is just a great piece of music to own.  After a stressful day i can pop this CD in the stereo and just forget my worries for a while.  Good times.
0783225792|3.0|This is basically &quot;Goodfellas&quot; rehashed but feels a lot longer, and has some Shakespearean ambitions---in many ways, it's Scorsese's version of &quot;King Lear&quot; which by itself was an awful play but here in a modern setting and on film is more bearable.  In a nutshell: relentless discipline and hard work puts a man in a very high place, whereupon his human weaknesses and other unforseen events beyond his control converge to bring him tumbling back down.<br />Scorsese being Scorsese, there aren't many dull moments (except for some of the more melodramatic dialogue between Sharon Stone and Robert DeNiro as their marriage disintegrates) and the film is always visually absorbing.<br />Unlike &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; this film is fairly predictable (even its violence) and a bit heavy-handed at turns...there's little of the former's gloriously anarchistic energy and amoral glee but bits and pieces of more overt moralizing.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was like a speeding bullet, &quot;Casino&quot; is more like a screeching cargo train that makes a lot of noise but there's never any doubt as to its final destination.<br />2 and 1/2 stars.
B000071ZZI|1.0|This movie bore absolutely no similarity to the book.  The casting was horrid; there was zero chemistry between Matt Damon and what's-her-name, and the ages were all wrong.  I seriously doubt if the screenwriters have read any of Ludlum's work, let alone &quot;The Bourne Identity.&quot;  Do yourself a favor and read the book instead.  The story line is brilliant and exciting, not at all like the mind-numbing tripe of this film.
B00003CXE7|2.0|I didn't find this movie that much of an attention grabber. The storyline was very slow and very long. You have to really be interested in ancient Rome to enjoy this movie. Or just be into Russel Crowe. I also found the storyline hard to follow. One of the only good things that caught my eye, or my ear I should say, was the soundtrack. The composer did an excellent job with the soundtrack.<br />The other thing that caught my eye was some of the special effects.<br />The acting by Joaquin Phoenix was just atrocious. I can't believe they made this guy such a cry baby. His mellowdramatic scenes were some of the worst that I had ever seen<br />I would only recommend this to someone that really likes Russel Crowe. Women, I have to tell you, you don't see that much of him. In fact, they must have run around everywhere wearing armor, because that's pretty much what he wore the whole movie.
B000065AG8|5.0|Not only one of Pixar's best movies but also fun for kids and grown-ups as well. Sully and Mike are as real as if they exist, and Boo is really cute.  Simply great!!!
B00006LPK5|2.0|Reign of Fire is a film that got off to a great start and immediately fizzled thereafter. The film quite simply is about a dormant race of dragons who are awakened from their underground slumber and lay waste to the earth. Mankind is reduced to living hand to mouth in medieval like enclaves.<br />The film's opening scene was quite promising. A young English boy, Quinn, visits his mother who works underground in the mines. The miners discover a mysterious, hidden shaft. There, they awaken a sleeping, fire breathing dragon, who immediately makes mince meat of those around it. Quinn and his mother try to escape, but only Quinn makes it, sheltered by his mother's body, as she makes the ultimate sacrifice.<br />Twenty years later, the earth is a desolate wasteland. The dragons have propagated, and the skies are filled with their alien presence. Clusters of surviving humans lead a medieval, hardscrabble existence, huddled against these fire breathing monsters that prey upon them. Quinn (Christian Bale) heads such a group.<br />One day, out of the blue, a group of Americans led by Denton Van Zan (a buffed up, gravelly voiced Matthew McConaughey) arrive at Quinn's enclave. There is a clash of wills and some animosity between the two groups, but ultimately Quinn and Van Zan join forces to try and change the course of history and save mankind in the process.<br />Quite frankly, the movie is dull and laughable, with plot holes, bad acting, and ham handed direction. While there are some interesting special effects, this alone does not make a movie. Though ambitious, the film simply tanks, lacking the underpinnings of a good script to sustain it as it lumbers to its grand finale, breathing its last to the viewer's thankful relief.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first bought this movie but after watching it I was unexpectably suprised. To bring the genre of a midevial dragon movie into this day and age seemed kind of nonscensical. Once you start getting the picture of the story it seems like a plausable situation. The special effects were great and Matthew McConaughey played a perfect [guy] who stole the movie. Christian Bale and the rest of the cast played their parts to the T. I don't know what most people might expect from this movie but I can be sure if you buy it you be both suprised and pleased.
0385720920|1.0|After not being able to put down Lullabye (and laughing out loud while reading it) I was tremendously disappointed here. I couldn't even finish it, and put it down half way through. It's boring and not funny at all. The characters are all unsympathetic. I wouldn't waste my time.
B00003CWL5|3.0|The movie is exactly how I just put it: 'beautifully shocking'.  This is the most daring role Kevin Spacey's has played since he was in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  It was very astounding and at the same time, alarming.<br />Anytime you have a character go from a depressed (in a sense), lonely and unhappily married guy to a ragging married guy who doesn't give a damn you know you've struck gold.  Again, Spacey takes the starring role and runs with it.  Many people dub this movie as a &quot;teen movie&quot;, which it's not.  And if you have seen &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; you know what I'm talking about.  But this a great drama flick that topped a lot of other movies in the year 1999.  Anyway, Spacey co-stars with wife Annette Bening as they struggle through a bad marriage and raising a lowly looking daughter.  It offers many surprises, and the 'kid with the bag' is more than just a kid with a bag.  Use your brain a little here, people.<br />I give the director Sam Mendes a lot of credit in making this film.  He did a lot and was able to do it in just over two hours.  I think anyone who likes seemly-twisted dramas or Kevin Spacey would enjoy this one.  It's stunning.
0316666343|5.0|You don't need to read what I am writing, you need to read this book. All I can say is wow. For all of you that wonder, this book seriously makes you think. Ms. Sebold has written an incredible book, one unlike any that I have ever read before. Thank you Alice Sebold, I truly enjoyed your story!
0790729628|5.0|A little disappointing. This is just a re-issue of the 1993 director's cut. When are we going to get the much talked about version with real extras and the scenes deleted from the original films release?
B00005JKNC|3.0|There is no way director Frank Darabont could have topped THE GREEN MILE and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Therefore, THE MAJESTIC all ready had a strike against it on those terms. Good to see Jim Carrey try on some serious roles and proves once again he is capable of doing straight drama. The film failed at the box office, hopefully it won't discourage him from doing more. Perhaps Carrey should take on supporting roles in dramas. THE MAJESTIC has it's heart in the right places with a great cast,decent script and good direction. There is an underlining theme of patriotism,hope, and standing up for on'es rights, but the film seems predictable and forced. It is a throwback to a Capra-esque type story telling landscape, but something is missing. There is no element of surprise, awe, or wonder and the mistaken identity plot in the film doesn't hold water. Somehow we know what is going to happen in this movie every step of the way yet we still stop and watch hoping for a surprise, and nothing happens. What saves the film is a good cast with the reliable David Ogden Stiers (tv's MASH),Martin Landau (ED WOOD), James Whitmore, and other veteran character actors playing their usual typecast selves : i.e. Bob Balaban (2010, SEINFELD),Hal Holbrook (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN), Ron Rifkin (tv's ALIAS),and Allen Garfield (THE CANDIDATE).
6305169187|3.0|In one of the best action movies of 1998, Bruce Willis leads the way along with a great, and hilarious, cast.  Ben Affleck co-stars with the daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Liv, as well as Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi (who is very comical here), Owen Wilson, William Fichtner, and Will Patton.<br />The movie was very well done, and the action carried throughout.  What I didn't like about the movie, and what kept it from reaching 4 maybe 5 stars is the lack of reality it possessed.  Just the idea of having two, not one, but two space ships land on a meteor traveling at millions of miles per hour is crazy.  I realize it's a work of fiction, but come on.  Some sense of authenticity should be present.  I liked the movie, don't get me wrong, there was just some parts that lost the intensity for me.  Other than that the movie was excellent.  I liked the ending; sad, but I liked it.  And the way that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck fight almost makes them seem like brothers.<br />So, if you are a fan of either Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck, you will--no doubt--enjoy the movie.  Also, if you have a thing for movies about the world almost ending, then this one's for you.  It's a good film; don't let my take on it's 'actuality' or 'reality' persuade you otherwise.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This film holds the honour of being the only film I've been to see where I let out an audible cheer in the cinema. This happened when the annoying Oirish \\"loveable rogue\\" was shot dead by the English seaman (well done that man). The guy had been annoying me all film with his antics (obviously aimed at the Irish-American audience) and was typical of the cliched characters that filled this movie.<br />The central romance story was entirely unconvincing and uninvolving. There was absolutely no chemistry between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leo DiCaprio) and Jack looks so young that Rose takes on something of the Mrs Robinson about her.<br />The only time I felt empathy for any of the characters was at the end, where like Jack I had gone numb from the waste downwards due to sitting through this dirge and felt my will to live slipping away.<br />However unlike most of those on the Titanic I made it out alive. Only then I had to put up with Quebec's revenge on the world for not being given independence, Miss Celine Dion hanging around the charts like a bad smell for weeks.
B000056V73|4.0|They really need to put a .5-spot in the scale, because this movie would be a 4.5.  It's not quite perfect enough to receive a 5 star rank, but it's better than just plain 4 stars.  Either way, this movie is awesome from star to finish.<br />I look at a director like Cameron Crowe and wonder why more people have not heard of him.  From his 1996 blockbuster hit &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; to his newest movie: &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, he seems to be on a role; or at least good at directing them.  This movie tells the story of the 70's little-known rock band Stillwater.  It's a brilliant story that at many points trys to include you in the movie.  First time actor Patrick Fugit could not have played the part of a fan/writer any better.  He's stellar, and you can't help but fall in love with him.  Oh, that innocence.  We also see appearances by the famous (or infamous, which ever you prefer) 'Penny Lane', played by the beautiful, yet cute, Kate Hudson.  And if you know anything about the actual band, this movie strikes new hope into the based-on-a-true-stories era that never really amounts to much.  The two main stars of the band,  Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) work wonders with each other, even if they are just fighting throughout the movie.<br />And as you see, the cast is just piling up with stars.  Along with Crudup, Hudson, Fugit, and Lee (who, by the way, stars in Cameron Crowes mentioned film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;) we have SNL star Jimmy Fallon and an underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Philip plays the part of &quot;Lester Bangs&quot;; rock and roll star by way of musical taste.  All in all every part is covered, and covered well.<br />I can't imagine why anyone who likes rock music, great movies, or a combination of both, wouldn't like this movie.  It's an awesome storyline that is as dramatic as it is funny.  Don't miss this movie; it is--hands down--the best movie of 2000.
0440180295|5.0|Few books have made me wonder about the possibilities inherent in time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, has an interesting characteristic; he skips through different periods of his life seemingly at any moment. At one moment, Billy is a middle-aged veteran, in the next, he is a private during World War 2, and in the next, he's a baby or sixty years-old and so on. It is not easy to define this novel's genre. It is meticulous in exploring dark comedy, science fiction, themes of anti-war, and more. However, it is without a doubt a masterpiece. It is an engaging read that opens a reader's thoughts to infinite possibilities.
B00006WUWP|4.0|By now I'm sure the only way you would want to see this movie is if you liked the first two.  And that's fair to say.  You either love the Austin Powers saga or you don't.  It's as simple as that.  Very rarely do we find a second, far more a third, sequel that can hold our attention like the first did.  I mean, even Jaws 3 wasn't that good.<br />But Mike Myers is at it again, dreaming up new ideas, new characters, and even a new ending.  I was most surprised by the ending of Goldmember.  I can't say I was eagerly awaiting it, but I was kind of hoping for a better ending.  I'm not going to tell you anything about the ending; other than the fact that there will be an Austin Powers 4.  They make sure of that.  I don't know how many more of these spoofs we'll be able to take.  Our sides will be split open from laughter.<br />Anyway, about the third one: it's very funny.  It's funnier than &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; but not as good as the original Austin Powers.  And if you read the cast list for this one, you will find cameos from Ozzy Osborne, Britney Spears, Steven Spielberg, John Travolta, Danny DeVito, and even Fred Savage (from &quot;The Wonder Boys&quot;, and his part's a bit more than a cameo).  Fred Savage plays Number 3, and has a huge mole on his face.  This, as you can imagine, provides for some of the best laughs of the Austin Powers series.  There is also a new girl.  After Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham, it's hard to find another great replacement.  Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, singer of Destiny's Child, plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra.  And she does okay.  I will say that she wasn't as good as either Liz or Heather, but it worked out pretty well.<br />Again, this goes without saying, if you liked either Austin Powers 1 and/or 2, then you will surely like this one.  If you hated the first 2, then you will hate this one as well.  Otherwise you are in for a pleasent surprise at the end.
B00005JK8K|2.0|Over the past few years war film buffs like myself have been treated to some great movies.  Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, When Tumpets Fade, and We Were Soldiers are just a few of the amazing films out now.  Sadly Windtalkers will never match any of those films.  In fact I doubt you can even consider this film a \\"War\\" movie.  Sure it is about WWII and focuses on the battle in the Pacific versus the Japanese but the film pulls off nothing more than a shoot-em-up action flick.  <BR>Windtalkers attempts to portray Nicholas Cage as a gung ho tough guy Marine who is in charge of escorting a Navajo \\"codetalker\\" in order to relay important information back to artillery, air strikes, etc... without the enemy breaking the code.  The plot is a unique storyline and a topic not too well discussed before but the director never fully accomplishes much that is compelling to the story.  Cage is his typical emotionless self and in my mind is a horrible actor.  He had no business being in this film but it is my theory that director John Woo needed a big named guy to sell the film.  Cage is flat throughout the entire film and never pulls off much to make his charater convincing.  He is supposed to be a man struggling with the loss of his entire squad and being the sole survivor.  He is supposed to be a strong old school military tough who is chosen to keep his \\"codetalker\\" safe and then subsequently kill him if the situation becomes precarious.  Because of this Cage decides he does not want to get too close to his \\"codetalker\\" since he may have to kill him.  But of course throughout the film Cage gets to know the \\"codetalker\\" and feels as though he could not kill him if the situation calls for it.  This plot line was expected and plays out exactly as one would expect.  No surprises at all here.  The problem is Cage has absolutely no emotion and never seems close to anything in the film not even his character.  The supporting cast, a roughshod bunch of Marines clumped to form his squad, also give horrible performances.  Woo tries to play out racism through these characters but the conflict is so forced it is not convincing at all.  The viewer never truly believes these Marines care that this guy is an indian at all.  Also the war time drama never really gets anywhere especially at night when they sit around and reminisce about regular life \\"back home\\" but these scenes are so choppy and flat that you can't seem to find any emotion in these guys.  <BR>As for the action the film is impressive with it's effects.  Woo is noted for his exciting action films and Windtalkers is quite exciting.  The movie is dominated with intense combat scenes but realism is sacrificed for Hollywood flair.  Cage becomes a poor mans Rambo and virtually shoots from his hip the entire film.  Running through heavy fire men are dropping all around him and Cage simply sprays a few rounds and enemy soldiers drop all over.  The worst was when he falls and while another man is on top of him he reaches for his 45 and fires aimlessly at a hill and 7 Japanese soldiers go down dead.  What an impressive shot.  Basically the battles were extremely intense and filled with little triumphs that Hollywood loves so much but comparred to Ryan or Band of Brothers this film doesn't have a chance with realism.  <BR>Overall I did not like this movie at all.  The only compelling performances were the two main Navajo's and Christian Slater.  The rest seemed like they had no clue what they were doing there and John Woo seems to have taken an interesting topic and crafted a cheesy action film around it.  Had this film been in the hands of Spielberg perhaps we would have been treated to a more convincing and more compelling war story instead of this laughable Rambo wannabe.
0780625129|5.0|In probably the most controversial film I've ever seen, director Tony Kaye tackles a very touchy subject that most directors wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole: racism.  I think the way in which he portrayed the characters of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is close to the best casting job a person could do.<br />Furlong and Norton are able to obtain a perfect amount of love for each other.  Whereas there is enough hate built up inside of the both of them to kill off the entire black community; which is something that is very prevalent in each scene.  There are some very disturbing images in the movie.  For example, when Norton smashes the jaw of the man who breaks into his car (we'll leave it at that) I almost threw up.  And that's the kind of brilliance you should be looking for in a film.  It can't matter whether or not the images or views are gross or even racist, because it's just a movie.  And it's a great one.  Seeing Edward Furlong break out of his \\"Detroit Rock City\\" bad-ass/photo-taking peckerboy-swagger is enough in itself to make this movie 5 stars.<br />But what really makes this movie so great is its ending.  I'm not going to spoil it for you, yet I'm sure you could give a few decent guesses that might be close.  The ending may have not been right in some people's eyes, and it may not have been a happily ever after finish either, but it's good.  There's no getting around that.  It's brilliant, it's shocking, and if you didn't see it coming the first time; watch it again.<br />There's no way you could possibly be disappointed with the movie, whether you're black or white.  It gives us a view of the high and low points of both races, and in the end it all works out.  So watch this movie and enjoy it, you won't be let down.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Take a piece of Soundgarden (a premier band of the early '90's) and combine it with pieces of arguably the most politcal band of the late twentieth century (Rage against the Machine), and what comes out is something fresh and unique! Audioslave provides all the sounds of modern rock'n roll, with excellent, versitalle vocals, and even some hints of classic rock. Don't miss tracks 1, Cochise, and 8, I am the Highway, the best two on the album.  Enough talk, though. Pick this one up and experience it for yourself.
0440234743|2.0|I listened to the audio version of this book and found it to be so slow, boring and predictable that I couldn't finish it.  Very disappointing when compared to some of John Grisham's other legal thrillers.
0312305060|4.0|THE HOURS is the type of book that I respected as I read, but I did not really enjoy it much.  The writing is terrific, even great at times.  I have not read MRS. DALLOWAY (I've read other Woolf writings), but I didn't have any difficulty following the writing or themes.  The book is certainly reminiscent of Woolf (imagery and stream of consciousness play a large role), but it isn't a simple copy of her style.  Unfortunately, I didn't connect emotionally with this book or the characters, which is unusual considering the issues with which it deals.  I'd recommend this book to others, but I didn't love it as I hoped I would.
B000002H2H|5.0|Great CD, Every Metallica fine, and really anyone who likes this genre of music should check this out!  Great!
B000069HK2|5.0|This Cd and Band are just simply awesome.  The first time I heard The Used was when I listened to their pop-punk song &quot;Taste of Ink,&quot;  I liked it even though it poppy so I bought the CD.  I expected the rest of the CD to be the catchy pop punk kind of tune that their single was.  I was wrong.  The rest of the CD doesnt even compare with &quot;the taste of Ink.&quot; I goes deeper. The blend of screaming vocals, and beautiful guitar and symphany is what got me with this CD.  The way Bert McCraken blends screams with background vocals in &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot; really shows how talented these guys are.  Not only is the music and tone in this CD great but the lyrics were incredible.  This band isnt just another group of angry teenagers who hate their parents for no particular reason.  They show a maturity comparalbe to bands that have been playing twice as long as them.  I reccomend this CD to anyone who truly wants to be moved by great music, while rocking out at the same time.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush Of Blood To The Head-<br />Is probably one of the few albums in a long time that really touched my soul.<br />The lyrics are simply beautiful and haunting at the same time.<br />5 stars from me!
020530902X|5.0|This book is a literary gem that has all the ingredients of a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is handy, appealing and very useful. I have seen it in a list of the top 100 non-fiction books of all time and it is also on the top of my list of aids to English.<br />I have yet to find an equivalent in the way the authors articulate the elementary rules of usage and elementary principles of composition. The pointers on the usage of words and style of writing are also invaluable.<br />This book is as timely as it is timeless. I see myself writing with more confidence, vigour and impact.
B0000009OP|5.0|My ex-boyfriend and I were hanging out in our apartment when this CD came on the stereo. I had only heard of Morphine at that point, yet had never actually heard them.  Ironically enough (or not), although I liked the album when I heard it the first few times, it wasn't until my breakup with the aforementioned ex-boyfriend that this album really gripped me, and when I finally realized its true genius.  I was driving around with a friend, right after the break-up, when &quot;Candy&quot; came on. &quot;Are you sure you want to hear this song right now?&quot; she inqured. &quot;Of course,&quot; I replied, in all of my self-torture, and even played &quot;In Spite Of You&quot; once or twice too, in between tears.  This album is absolutely gorgeous, especially if you are suffering.  (And if you're not suffering, then you'll be able to just enjoy its candid beauty, I'm sure).  The title is more than appropriate for this collection of sad, soulful, and well, just plain gorgeous, songs. . . There is really no way to classify this album in one genre, but it is an outstanding combination of jazz, blues, and rock and roll. Musically, it is genius. Lyrically, as well. And every tune is heartfelt and poignant, and pulls right at those proverbial heart-strings, but never in a bitter or excessive way. . .  This album is a remarkable companion to heartache/heartbreak, but is user-friendly enough that it can be listened to in almost any mood.  Ironically enough, perhaps, it provides great background music to a romantic trist.  Or even when you're hanging out alone in your pad, sipping a glass of wine, perhaps, and just wanting to hang out and be mellow. These guys have real and true talent, and every song is an emotional venture into the human psyche. And each song is exquisite, beautiful, intense. . . My faves are &quot;A Head With Wings&quot; (imagine the metaphorical possiblities!), &quot;In Spite of Me&quot; (a song which can surely make even the coldest heart melt), and &quot;Sheila&quot; (a song for all cat-lovers, as Shiela adores her cat so, and even &quot;puts a spell on the cat, a beautiful cat. . . &quot;). If you're looking into the mystique of Morphine, &quot;Cure for Pain&quot; is a wonderful way to start. . . this album is resplendent with wonder, and has the potential to make you feel wonderous. . .  It has cast a sort of spell on my soul, and I hope that it can do the same for you. . .
0679722556|2.0|As fond as I am of this novel I cannot recommend this particular paperback Vintage edition.  In a work so meticulous and richly crafted as _Howards End_, it's more than a little jarring to stumble across typos and spelling errors in the text.  A handsome and attractive volume, such as we've all come to expect from Vintage, but those typos are really unforgivable.  By all means read the book, but opt for a different edition.
0767830555|5.0|Few will disagree with me when I say that Scorsese's Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made. This one helped define the 70s and changed the face of American cinema. Scorsese's directing is brilliant. DeNiro has never been better, nor has Cybill Shepard (except in The Last Picture Show). This is one of Harvey Keitel's finest performances, and Jodi Foster has her best role here. The acting is superb. The cinematography was groundbreaking with the camera moves Scorsese made. Superb editing. And while Bernard Herrmann's score is dated (definitely from the 70s), it is a classic and fits this film in a way no other music ever could. Add that to the fact that Herrmann died just after finishing recording for this film. What a way to end your career. This film is superb in every way.<br />The dvd is a treasure as well. You get a making of documentary that lasts just over an hour, taking the place of a commentary track (and this is one of the few documentaries that can replace a commentary track). There are storyboards, the screenplay, filmographs, advertising materials, and a photo montage that is narrated and covers trivia that isn't discussed in the documentary. This is a fine edition. <br />This is the movie that brought Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese, Jodi Foster, and Paul Schrader to forefront of the American eye.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Everything that it's predecessors do wrong, Band of Brothers does right.
B0000524CY|5.0|In 1973 one of the most horrifying films of all time was made--William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, starring Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, and the wonderful Max von Sydow. All the principal actors, as well as the supporting cast, gave brilliant performances. It won the Oscar for Best Sound and Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (it was nominated for 8 other Oscars, including Best Picture). This is a story of a young girl who is possessed and what happens during. It's also a story of faith and redemption. There are some horrifying images throughout the film. And the very premise of the movie sends a chill down your spine--think of your own child possessed by a demon...what could you do? So many things help to add up to create this movie in all it's horrifying glory. This is truly one of the best films ever made. <br />The dvd is 'The Version You've Never Seen Before' which was rereleased a few years ago in theaters, and includes many scenes originally cut (and it was a shame these scenes were cut, almost all of them enhance the story). You get trailers, tv spots, radio spots, and trivia about the film. Friedkin also has a commentary track, and a very good one. He doesn't go into the technical aspects of making the story (perhaps there should have been a second track that discussed the techniques behind the film), but neither does he ramble on about nothing (as many commentary tracks do) nor does he narrated the story we are watching (which many directors do on their commentary tracks...and that's a waste of a track). He discusses the film, and he does a great job of it. It's a great commentary (though I wish he had added a technical commentary track), one that is valuable for the fan of The Exorcist and even more so for the film student.
B00003OSTN|5.0|Simply stated: \\"Mildred\\" is a truly outstanding motion picture experience!! I was riveted to my seat for the entire 1-hour, 51-minute film!<br /><br />I cannot rave enough about this picture! The opening shadowy scenes with Joan Crawford and Jack Carson are remarkable! The DVD version can only enhance this great photography.<br /><br />Carson, by the by, is fantastic in \\"Mildred\\". As is a quite young-looking Eve Arden.<br /><br />Also keep your eyes peeled for one of the best \\"screen slaps\\" I've seen in a while! Joan is belted a good whack by that brat of a daughter of hers (immaculately portrayed by Ann Blyth). Can someone say \\"Bad Seed\\"?!!<br /><br />If you've never seen \\"Mildred\\" before, do yourself a huge favor and do so.
0553565915|4.0|I read this book about 9 years ago, while in college. I was having a rough time, and her words gave me great comfort!<br />Even if you don't fully beleive everything in the book, the underlying messages should give you peace. This book started a great interest in me about angels, something that has helped to comfort me in the following years. If you have ever had a loved one die, or are worried about death yourself, then read this book....if nothing else, it is an easy read, and you can make up your own mind....There is a christian theme throughout the book, and having been raised Catholic, some of the ideas went against what I had been taught.....but I have never been against hearing others opinions, who knows, you may like it?? I did!
B00006X06U|2.0|Never thought I'd hear it. After listening to Joni's work since 1970, I am bemused at this offering. While the lush, smooth sounds from the orchestra do a fine job of interpreting Joni's work, they are simply that. It's not just Joni's words or music, but her arrangements that make her music what it is. This offering looses that Joni essence - regardless of her obvious influence in the production. I almost suspect that someone else could have recorded this CD with similar results. If Joni's voice, or any of the lyrics on this CD touches you, I can only suggest you listen to some earlier Joni (Blue, Ladies of the Canyon, Hyjera, and one of her most profound - Mingus). They'll change your life, this one won't.
6304698690|5.0|To be honest, I remember seeing previews of this movie way back when it came out (in 1993) and thinking to myself, \\"WHY would anyone want to see such a film; more importantly, WHY would anyone make it?\\" Well, about five years later it appeared on TV one night when I was bored. I decided to give it a try, fully expecting to turn it off within 20 minutes or so. WOW -- was I ever wrong!<br />What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- film-making of the highest order. \\"The Secret Garden\\" is a movie of such high artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (although, of course, these two flicks inhabit two opposite ends of the thematic spectrum). It's no wonder that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in  both of these pics -- he was the director of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (duh) and the executive producer of \\"The Secret Garden.\\"<br />Anyway, the cinematography is breathtaking and the music is wondrously outstanding. <br />To be brief, the story's about a young spoilied English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900's. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyranically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is highly intelligent, independant and sly she is easily able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died in childbirth about ten years before, but her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle evidently never healed from this heartbreak and this explains his frequent absences.<br />Mary finds a secret garden in her explorations, a hidden garden closed up and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the beautiful garden along with her pal Dickon. She instinctively senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced he is; she knows the best thing for Colin would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.<br />\\"The Secret Garden\\" is kind of a 1990's version of the outstanding \\"Pollyanna\\" with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the \\"glad girl\\" that Pollyanna is. (In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old man gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends).<br />\\"The Secret Garden\\" is no doubt labled a \\"children's film;\\" this is a shame because it so transcends such a limiting category. It is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults. SEE IT!
B000002H6C|3.0|This Album by Metallica would of been a 5 star, but they are missing a sound so important to all Rock/Metal Music, The BASS. I understand that Cliff Burton passed away so tragically and the members were greiving, but it gave the original three members no right to take it out on the new Bassist Jason Newsted. Cliff Burton wouldn't of wanted Metallica to call it quits, and I am sure that he wouldn't want any replacement to be treated the way Jason was.  It's sad that Jason was even considered a replacement.  To be honest with you, I am a bigger fan of Burtons work, but I still respect Jason Newsted and he wasn't respected on this album.  Jason is a very talented Bassist and it's a disapointment he wasn't even heard.
0743224345|1.0|This book is a disappointment. I agree with the previous reviewer that you are better off sticking with the Basic Kaplan stuff. If you really want to get practice with 800-style questions, go to the back of each section of the Offical GMAT Guide. They put the most difficult questions at the back. Those are far better than anything offered here.
B00005JLD4|5.0|A great job of storytelling was done to recount the lives of Aboriginal families during an era of forced relocating of the mixed race children in an attempt to \\"save\\" them from themselves and their culture. <BR>The absolute raw detail of the movie reveals how the children were kidnapped from their families and sent to be trained as domestic servants or if their skin was light enough, adopted by white Austrailian families.  The children were told that they should forget about their mothers and get used to another way of life.   It was the insightfulness and sheer determination of the movie's young heroine, Molly Craig, that led the girls 1500 miles through the desert and back to their families.<BR>See it and read the book - it's a story worth knowing and one that should not be forgotten.
0060977493|5.0|Arhundathi Roy's book, GOD OFSMALL THINGS, introduced to me a new writing style- poeticand yet tangible. It has since become my favorite book. The plot is poignant and yet, when you read it, the story unfolds in such a way that,as you realize whats happening it moves you. At first I had ahard time understanding what wasgoing on because of her unique style,but as I read on, I became accustomed to it,and rather enjoyed it. I'm glad I was reading it for school,because if not, I would have given up reading it, but since it was mandatory, I read on. Don't give up on reading this book-it's worth it.
B00004XONN|1.0|Kid a is pretentious, self indulgent, downbeat and boring. I hear it's suppose to be experimental and innovative, but it's the complete oposite. It's safe and simple techno music for beginners. This could be mistaken for an Aphex Twin demo tape if it wasn't for Thom Yorkes high pitched mumbling.
0767817478|4.0|Sometimes you should not think during a movie. Sometimes you should just sit back and be swallowed into the magic that is cinema. This is that kind of flick. It's called escapism. Like fantasy, sci-fi and horror or just about any movie, it takes you into a different world. So what if the acting is sub-par; this was done with tongue-in-cheek! And it's a monster movie for cryin out loud! Not Citizen Kane. The only thing the director and producers did wrong was to name this giant monster after a classic Japanese monster instead of coming up with an original name that might have made this film the Godzilla of the U.S.<BR>Remakes are mistakes.<BR>This was a big, fun, and loud monster-on-the-loose movie.<BR>Anyway, rent it and decide for yourself. If you like it enough to buy like I did, then you must have had fun watching it and gave your brain a rest.<br />When you think about it, you can critique any movie into a negative. Even Casablanca! So lighten up and enjoy a movie for what it was intended....Entertainment.
B000000WA4|1.0|Apart from a few flashes of genius, mainly the singles, this album is mostly poor. I mean, 28 songs? C'mon Billy, do you really love the sound of your own voice that much? I imagine even the most avid Pumpkins fan (which i am not) would begin to get dizzy after 28 songs of your monotonous nasal whining. Other than the singles there isn't much else worth listening here. I recommend you get Gish and stay away from this nasty pretentious beast.
006097625X|1.0|this book is an attempt to deconstruct comics.   To over analyze them to such a degree as to make you lose sight of what you are really looking at.  Scott McCloud spends pages and pages over pointless items like the definition of a comic, and other useless ideas.  The Triangle he creates for art seems right out of Dead Poets Society. The guy obviously wants to do comics badly but isn't talented enough to actually do them.  As the old adage goes, Those who can, do and those who can't, teach.
B00006RCNW|5.0|What can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said. This is the best show on TV right now. I wasn't a big fan of NYPD blue or other cop drama's, but this one is remarkably different. If you watch one episode I guarantee you will fall in love and want to see more. Simply put, if you have a T.V. and DVD player, BUY THIS NOW! Enjoy.
B00005Y228|5.0|I have always liked Kylie's music.  She possesses a quality about her that emanates star power in the works.  Her commercials capture your eye; her music takes you away to another place, a better place.  Thank you for being who you are Kylie.
B000001FI7|5.0|From beginning to end this album is truly a crushing work of genius.  It is both lurid and profound.  I remember when I first bought this album I ended up devoting my whole day to listening to it over and over again. 'Dummy' is stocked with a stunning array of evocative and pure emotion, from tracks that prove to be equally as tranquil as they are alive, backed by Beth's innocuous and bright vocals.  No matter how many times I listen to this album it still crushes me just like the first time.  Whatever your into musically Portishead should undeniably be an eminent realization!
B000059MEK|5.0|This album is very, very well done.  Its a &quot;must own&quot; in my opinion.
B00005JLO2|1.0|This is a movie that can not make up it's mind what it wants to be.  At times it is an action movie, at other times it is making a statement against imperialism, and at other times a love story.  The problem is it does not stay on any one theme long enough to make an impact. It is beautifully shot, but one gets the feeling that a lot of footage and the story wound up on the cutting room floor. <BR>  It is a shame really, as one keeps getting hints that the cast and the director coul/want to do more in this film, but somewhere along the way the focus got lost
6303029027|2.0|The scenes where Calogero runs are just sad to me.  The poor guy has obviously never been a normal kid.  He looks ridiculous. This is why the Fonz never ran on &quot;Happy Days&quot;.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Wow. After all the reviewers who have gone before me and said all the things I wish I could have thought of to say, I guess I'm left with just voicing my opinion.<br />I'm not a huge Tolkien fan. I don't use the elvin language when instructing telemarketers to go to a dark place. In fact, I have not (gasp!) even read the entire set of books in the Lord of the Rings. So perhaps I can use my voice to speak for the masses of other people like me who aren't obsessed with this great man.<br />The Two Towers is great! The actors are superb, the setting breath taking, the directing incredible, the computer simulations seamless, the horses unbelieveable ... I could go on and on. This film leaves you drained and stumbling out into the bright world beyond the theater wondering whether you will be able to drive home without encountering any Orks, and (in my case) wishing you had Aragorn by your side to help you make it. Golum was especially well done, fascinating. The interaction between the various groups of wanderers was full of the warmth of friendship. Touching.<br />However ... having seen both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, I felt the Fellowship was just the least bit better. There was more storyline, I felt, and more suspense.<br />That said, both of these films were incredible and, having now gone and read the first two books in the series, I felt the movies stayed close enough to the orignal. Movies are different than books. You can't simply take a book and turn it word for word into a movie. I felt the adaptions were well done and did not alter the meaning of the story.<br />All this from a mere layperson in the Tolkien world! A layperson who recommends you rush out and see this movie, because it will never be the same at home on your small TV screen with your greasy microwave popcorn tucked between your knees and your baby howling....<br />Highly recommended.
6305161879|5.0|There's nothing more to say about the crazy plot that hasn't been blabbed away before. Important here is that the great Charles Crichton was nominated for Best Director, after 50 years of respectability. Amusing is that, though Kevin Kline won the Oscar, he wasn't nominated by BAFTA (British Academy); they gave it to Palin. Both are great! Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect, and John Cleese used all of his &quot;Monty Python&quot; humor to create an Oscar nominated script (with Crichton).15 years later, this is fresh and fun and worthy of repeated viewings, and watching the British writers let the Americans make fun of them (they all end up looking stupid), you can't help but laugh. Unnoticed my many is the great performance of Maria Aitken (Wendy, Cleese's wife). She a totally committed insensitive beast. She was great. Also ignored, was the lovely score of John du Prez, most original. Give yourself a laugh, and forget the real world. This is fun! Oh, DO shut up, Portia.
B000002U9L|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since I was 10 years old. I'm now 22 and love it still. This movie, of a girl's journey from adolescence to adulthood, is beautifully scored by the songs of David Bowie and is probably on the top 3 list of all time greatest soundtracks. Songs like Magic Dance, Underground, and When The World Falls Down are beautiful examples of Bowie's exeptional talent as a singer/songwriter. I can do nothing but reccomend this album to anybody who...eehh...to anybody that...eehhh, well to anybody!!!
B000001FI7|5.0|this is an amazing album. truly a classic in an age deprived of many. Portishead are: Geoff Barrow, Beth Gibbons, and Adrian Utley. the first five tracks are an exercise in sublimity - especially &quot;it could be sweet&quot; and &quot;wandering star&quot;. &quot;it's a fire&quot; and &quot;numb&quot; are not as great, particularly &quot;it's a fire&quot;. but then we return to form with &quot;roads&quot; and &quot;pedestal&quot;. &quot;pedestal&quot; sounds like awesome acid-jazz and &quot;roads&quot; is a marvelous futuristic torch song. &quot;biscuit&quot; is not that great, either, but &quot;glory box&quot; is immortal, as are all the first 5 tracks, &quot;roads&quot;, and &quot;pedestal&quot;. incredible accomplishment.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Wow. This is like the very best instrumental musical soundtrack I've ever heard. A lot of people have been saying the one from Fellowship was better, but I haven't heard it, and I only saw that movie once, on DVD, while babysitting-not much chance to get into it. Anyways, this CD has some extremely powerful music. Some of it reminds me a little of Holst's Planets. My favourite tracks are 3-Riders of Rohann, 18-Samwise the Brave, and 19-Gollum's song. Yes, Gollum's song. It took a while, but that song definitely grows on you. The words (and the 'whininess') totally catch the essence of Gollum- you'll realize this if you've read the last books, more that if you've just seen/read the Fellowship and the Two Towers. I TOTALLY recommend this to anyone who likes instrumental music.
B00004STPT|4.0|It is unusual to see a film of the scope and power of 'Gladiator' and still think about the music that accompanied the film. The special effects are not the co-star of this film, the music is. Hans Zimmer has created brilliant and ethereal orchestrations, accompanied by the angelic voice of Lisa Gerrard, creates music that invokes the time, place and feel of the film. It combines middle-eastern and classical moods, demonstrating the violence and the sensitivity of the film. Highlights of the soundtrack are the amazing tracks &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Now We Are Free.&quot;<br />Whether or not you have seen the film, the music is beautiful to listen to. But, it certainly brings back every frame of the film when you listen to it, just as watching the film made me want to purchase the soundtrack.
B00004RERW|4.0|Celine Dion voice is really amazing, specially when you listen to the SACD multichannel format. You would feel that Titanic's soundtrack so powerful.
0316666343|4.0|To be fair, by the time I read this book, I'd heard so much about how wonderful it was, that really it probably could never have lived up to the hype. Even so, it was an intriguing story. The narrator doesn't get as deeply inside the characters' thoughts as I thought she could have. Also, the story seems to lose some of its passion and momentum in the middle. Despite this, I still found it to be an enjoyable read, and it's worth picking up.
6300208591|5.0|If film is a collaboration of people attempting to clarify one person's view of the world -- that of the director -- then La Dolce Vita is the most spectacular example of this paradox that I've seen yet. A series of intwertwined anecdotes, none of which have much in common, outline the sketchy life that is Marcello Mastroianni's. As a celebrity reporter, he walks the line between living a real life and creating one out of thin air, manipulating the people he knows and loves, hiding his emotions behind a veneer of indifference that threatens to suffocate him -- and us -- as the emotional wight of the film swells throughout, threatening to overwhelm him (and us) unless he acts instead of reacts.<br />Love and sex, life and death, friendship and family, religion and reality -- all are covered here but none are analyzed. To his credit, Fellini is able to evoke more from a gesture, a pause or a heartbreaking silence than most filmmakers can from a full 90 minutes. From the opening image of a helicopter transporting a giant statue of Jesus over a swimming pool bedecked with bathing beauties, Fellini manages to cover a multitude of feelings, desires, questions and fears simultaneously. Personally, my favorite sequences involve Mastroianni's father, whose silence says more about his regard for his son and his own life than any dialogue would, and the scene in the castle rooms connected by echoes, which sums up the frustration of things unheard, miscommunicated and left unsaid. How different would any of our lives be if we could all speak face to face; how exasperatingly perfect a metaphor for the failures of personal communication.<br />Although 8 1/2 is regarded as Fellini's most personal film and enduring testament, I've always voted for La Dolce Vita as his masterpiece. Understated (if a Fellini film can be), filled with majestic images that burn themselves into one's subconscious while inviting subsequent viewings, bursting with undiscussed passions and intentions, this is a document of a life ALMOST lived. I find it hard to believe anyone could walk away from this film NOT glad to be alive.is a document of a life ALMOST lived. I find it hard to believe anyone could walk away from this film NOT glad to be alive.
0380977788|5.0|Though anyone under seven, unless particularly precocious, may find it too incomprehensible or disturbing. Anyone else should love it. <BR>Coraline is a smooth read - I only wish there had been more of it. I personally think that this book is a better example of the originality of Gaiman's ideas and fluidity of his prose than the oft-lauded \\"American Gods.\\" (Which isn't bad, mind you, just not as good as this.)<BR>So pick this book up, and if you are intending to read it to a child, do read it yourself first, if only to figure out what tune you will be using to sing the rat songs aloud.
B00005RYKU|2.0|Ah yes, Leelee Sobieski...what can I say? A poor man's Helen Hunt in an even poorer film. Skip it. Better yet, hopscotch it.
0316096199|4.0|This book is a sad statement about the # of women who get raped in America, and how few report it, or seek/get a conviction. A sad statement about how a rape victim is victimized again and again throughout the reporting process and legal process.<br />This book, in many ways reminds me of the books I read about the Holocaust. It's a brutal, horrible story that must be told and must be read. This book, I'm sure, was as hard for the author to write as it is for us to read.
B00005O5CM|5.0|No one could have played Elle Woods quite as well as Reese Witherspoon, and I think her performance is why &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; succeeds on so many levels. With her case-closed smile and innocent baby blues, Witherspoon as a sorority princess who makes the grade in the Ivy League, lifts what could have been a trial into the realm of inspired fluff. Elle is smarter than she looks (a lesson the film belabors) and has the good sense to hire a Coppola to direct her admissions video.<br />First-time director Robert Luketic's heavy hand with sitcom farce strains credulity and patience. But the script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (Ten Things I Hate About You), gets off a few zingers, and Witherspoon - though miles from the keen satire of Election - stays one sharp cookie even as the film's plausibility crumbles. The silly and predictabl plot moves along at a trip hammer speed, however, and it is all played for laughs. Of course it is Witherspoon's performance that makes the film so much better than it should be. Her on-screen prescene is electrifying and her smile can melt just about anyone. This is certainly one of the better teen movies out there!!
B00006RCNW|5.0|This might not be for the faint-of-heart - this is the \\"Hard R\\" to NYPD Blue's \\"PG-13\\".  It aims for a greater degree of realism (or hyper-realism) in the detectives' interactions with pedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers than ABC's show can.  <br />For everyone who can take it - say, everyone who can appreciate the movie \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (which might have helped to pioneer the level of machismo in entertainment that you'll see here) this is a hell of a show.  <br />The influences are obvious - this is about 50% NYPD Blue (the style of the show, and some of the substance), 20% The Sopranos (central figure is amoral by traditional standards, and brutal), 20% Training Day (which was also based in Los Angeles, and also concerned with the difference between being a wolf or a sheep), and maybe 10% Bad Lieutenant (the raw exploits of a corrupted soul).<br />The show does a lot with those influences.  From the pilot episode on, it sets itself up with logic and precision.  We watch a group of characters interact in a series of games and conflicts, coming to understand all of their points of view, and not understanding how or if the conflicts between them will resolve.  Like \\"The Sopranos\\", this is a brilliant character-based show.  It's highly compelling viewing, and adds up to an interesting portrait of modern urban police work (and not a pretty one).
B00000JGOJ|5.0|PLAYING BY HEART is a character-driven drama about the sometimes funny (sometimes painful) and always complex ways love can touch your life (and your heart). Set in Los Angeles, the film weaves in and out of the lives of a group of eleven people of varied generations and lifestyles, all of whom are experiencing love in one of its many maddening stages. Some people are finding it, some are rediscovering it, and others are losing it. What they have in common is an intense desire to express how love makes them feel. <br />The film weaves in and out of these stories with no paricular destination, but it offers some honest, crisp, and funny dialogue, not to mention more than a few surprises. The film focuses on a series of couples (and all those somehow connected with them), who are in one way or another battling relationship problems. There is the long married couple (Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery)  dealing with the pains of a past affair that may or may not have happeed, the Gen-X club-hoppers (Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe) who may or may not want a relationship, the divorcee (Gillian Anderson) unable to commit to a new love (Jon Stewart), the married woman (Madeleine Stowe) having an affair with the married man (Anthony Edwards), the heartbroken mother(Ellen Burstyn) whose gay son (Jay Mohr) is dying of AIDS, and of course, the man (Dennis Quaid) who frequents bars to lie to women. The biggest mystery is how these characters are interrelated, but when it is finally revealed, it seems all too predictable . But who cares--it is the unbelievably excellent performances that make Playing by Heart such a wonderful film to watch. The cast has amazing chemistry, and all but carry the film on their shoulders. From start to finish, Playing By Heart is a wonderful, clever, and moving picture--an undiscovered gem that deserves an audience.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album has got to be one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Anyone will absolutly love Weezer and this is the album to buy if you havent heard them. Rivers Cuomo is a musical genius, and I am NOT a prejudice listener. I listen to all types of music, from reggae to classic rock to ska and more. Weezer is by far the greatest. Blue Album will appeal to anyone, even my grandma likes it. It is definately the best Weezer album with Maladroit next. The songs are funny and meaningfull and are so pleasing to listen to. If you are not sure you want to buy this, listen to a few of their songs. Undone, Say It Ain't So, and In the Garage, are the classic Weez songs that never get old. Undone is THE song to have high times with. Buy this, and Junta by Phish, and you have the two greatest albums ever!
6305428425|5.0|A deliciously cast screw-ball comedy, the film tells the story of ditzy best friends Romy and Michele (wonderfully played by nd Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow) who decide to attend their 10-year high school reunion, but try to impress the former classmates who tormented them by completely making over themselves and their personalities. The two stars keep the film moving along, despite the various lapses in David Mirkin's direction, and the weird suspicion that the cute idea can't sustain a full-length feature film. (Proven by the lenghy mid-dream sequence). However, Sorvino and Kudrow are definitely worth seeing the film for. They know their characters, and become them, making these unbelievable women totally real. The supporting cast include the always wonderful Alan Cumming, Camryn Manheim, and Janeane Garofalo as a vicious, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed former classmate, who has some amazingly funny lines, and proves to be one of the better characters in the film. The 80's soundtrack just adds to the feel (and the fun). It is meant to me a fluffy, light, and funny film, and it totally succeeds on that level. This movie defines Guilty Pleasure! Perfect for a boring Sunday afternoon.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I think RATM is one of the top 10 bands of the 90's, but I did get tired of all the rapping on their albums.  It took me 3 listens before I actually realized how good this album is.  So if you gave up after just one, put it back in next time you go for a long car ride, because you don't know what you are missing.  Audioslave is the right mixture of Morello's huge guitars, with Wilk's drums, Commerford's bass, and most importantly Cornell's voice.  Granted there seems to be more medium paced songs then their are fast/moshing ones, but it is a perfect blend of how rock albums used to be.  Not every song on rock bands' albums have to be fast paced agression.  Like A Stone is destined to be #1 on rock radio.  It just has a feel to it that makes you want to hear it again and again.  And the first time I heard Hypnotizer, I thought to myself, this song is why the pit was invented.  It's fast paced from first second to last.  All in all its a throw back album, it's what rock albums used to be.
B00006RU5B|5.0|A great album and a great start by audioslave. One of the better albums of 2002. If these guys stay together they have the accessories (conell and morello) to become one of the best live bands and produce some fantastic music long into the future!!<br />... <br />For gods sake.. BUY IT NOW!!
B000002BHE|5.0|This album is from 1996, before the strong hit of \\"My heart will go on\\", maybe we can say that Titanic's song it's Celine's best (me personally I don't think so, the song is good but it was ALL day long in the radio stations) well as I was saying, this album has also big hits as the Top 10 \\"It's all coming back to me now\\" an INCREDIBLE song or \\"because you loved me\\" which won a Grammy award. Another great song is \\"You make me feel like a natural woman\\" I think that I don't need to say that this is a cover from A.Frankling. \\"Call the man\\" was a hit in 1997, the impact of the album was incredible, it won Grammy awards, sold nearly 20 million copies, topped The Hot 200 and charted for 150 weeks.<BR>My personal favorite songs from this album are: \\"It's all coming back to me now\\", \\"I love you\\", \\"Because you loved me\\", \\"If that's what it takes\\" and \\"Falling into you\\".<BR>Celine Dion is a great singer, maybe the world's best, but as a person who has her whole English discography, I think that \\"Falling into you\\" and \\"A new day has come\\" are her best albums.
B000002H97|5.0|This album still hasnt lost its replayability after 12 years!! Worth the green.
B00003CXXM|1.0|I really tried to get into this movie, but I just could not.  The plot was very weak which is strange because I only heard good things about the book.
B000002UAX|4.0|Yes this probably should have been a great single album, but who cares, it's still great! Honestly, Wild Honey pie is really the only worthless song on the entire thing. I'll also go out on a limb and say that I'm glad they put Revolution 9  on it. <br />Disc 1 begins w/a great rock song, Back in the U.S.S.R., and contains a great variety of songs, most inventive although some maybe a bit too inventive. Some are soft and beautiful like Dear Prudence, Blackbird, I will, and Julia, and some are just plain fun (Glass Onion, Ob-la-Di Ob-la-Da). To me the three highlights are Don't Pass Me By, Ringo's first composition, Happiness is a Warm Gun,a Lennon song that i could listen to over and over, and parhaps the best song on both discs-While My Guitar Gently Weeps, written by Harrison and w/ Eric Clapton on guitar.<br />Disc 2 also has it's ups and downs- Revolution 1 is good but doesn't compare to the single version, Birthday and Everybody's Got Somthing to Hide...are good songs though they may get annoying, and Long Long Long is just plain blah. However, Helter Skelter and Yer Blues never get old and are about as hard as you'll hear the Beatles get, and it all ends w/ Good Night, a drastic contrast from the rocking songs on disc 2.<br />Overall 4 out of 5, simply because as much as i hate to say it- this WOULD have been better as a single album. Oh Well.
B00005JL95|4.0|Our whole family liked this movie that we regretfully didn't see untill it was released on video. We have a little boy and girl so it is nice to find a movie that will appeal to them both. Usually the Disney movies are geared towards one gender or the other, but both the kids liked this one. I really liked the Elvis music instead of the normal sappy tunes that accompany the &quot;kiddie&quot; movies and I found the sarcasm great! I also liked the message, sometimes the ones you love drive you nuts, but you would never want anyone in the family to be left behind.
B000002UB6|3.0|Songs taken from the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions of 1968-9 make up the last album the group released (though Abbey Road was last to be recorded). Even with the Beatles in the process of breaking up, there is still great music.(3 of the songs made #1)Let it Be and The Long and Winding Road are beautiful masterpieces written by Paul. I've Got A Feeling and Get Back are great rockers, and Two Of Us and Across the Universe are also worth praise. <BR>     However there are 2 seemingly worthless songs (Dig It and Maggie Mae), the version One After 909 doesn't compare to the one on Anthology 1, For You Blue drags a bit and Dig a Pony just gets confusing to listen to. That leaves I Me Mine,a pretty good song , which discusses the ego problem in the group. There are some great songs, but by no means the Fab Four's best album.
B000002KIK|3.0|It seems to me that all I hear from Never Say Die are bad reviews, I mean come on it may not Paranoid or Volume 4 but it's better than the stuff that Sabbath has done in the 80's and 90's as well as Ozzy's later solo stuff.<BR>The album begins with the straight forward title track which is another Black Sabbath gem, Johnny Blade is a good song with great solos by Tony Iommi. Junior's Eyes is about the death of Ozzy Osbourne's father. Hard Road is about as laid back as Black Sabbath has ever gotten. Shock Wave is a decent song during the Techincal Ecstasy/Never Say Die time period. Air Dance, Over to You are mediocre, it just doesn't do it for me.<BR>Breakout is another instrumental which actually turns out to be the intro to Swingin' The Chain (with drummer Bill Ward on vocals), All I hear is about this song are negative reviews and I just happen to like that song.<br />If you're a beginner for Black Sabbath, get Paranoid, Master of Reality or Sabotage (Sabbath's last great album with Ozzy).<BR>And if you're a hard metal fan, then this album isn't for you, if you like rock music, then you should give this album a try.<br />Only recommended to diehard fans.
B00005JKJA|4.0|For the first time a David Lynch movie is nearly a whole dream.<BR>Because of that the film is more understandable than \\"Lost Highway\\" for example. Everybody knows that everything is possible in our dreams or nigtmares, so the surreal scenes seem normal.<BR>He should have win the oscar for the best director this time. Although, and that is something I notice in all his movies, except the first one \\"Eraserhead\\", the different parts of the film doesnt create a 100% globality. They seem very distanced from each other, like 10 different dreams compiled in one. Perhaps because of the radical flashback-cutting method we have to get used to.<BR>The performances are great, the lesbian scene is also great (and HOT!) and the music of Badalamenti is perfectly adapted to the images.<BR>You have to see this film to leave the boring reality during 140 minutes. <BR>If you like \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" youll love \\"Mulholland Dream\\"!

It will be interesting to see if inquiries into the latest disaster with the Columbia shuttle reveal the same weaknesses in NASA communication between the head (money-raising, grandstanding) honchos and the engineers who had hands- on knowledge of the shuttle. The technological aspect is obviously pertinent but the group dynamics of the commission and the organization they were scrutinizing is the real story.<BR>In addition to the Challenger portion of the book, there are delightful chapters on the author's childhood relationship to his father and to his first wife, both of them original and irreverent characters, as, apparently, was Feynman.

B00003CWN2|4.0|I found this story so incredibly sad.I haven't seen the documentary but would like to and probably will,I've read the reviews about it.Its a very disturbing movie especially the total failure of law enforcement to help this young woman.I also couldn't believe that the mother would tell where Teena(Brandon) was staying, she must have know of the intent of the two boys.Its just unbelievable that she would do that.<BR>After reading the true story I was a bit dissapointed in the liberties taken by the film makers.Especialy that Brandon thought that Lana had betrayed her to the two rapists because Lana said that \\"she would be ok in their company\\". That was must have been heart breaking to Brandon, actually shattering when you think about it. The movie gave no inkling of this. <BR>But it is still a riveting movie and an absolute tragedy...<BR>Enough said cold blooded murders like this are horrible and the movie did a good job shedding light into this dark little corner of America.
B000003S0K|5.0|Worlds famous experimentator in the new technology of compiuterized keyboards, tape machines and syntesizers, Brian Eno is a most significant virtuosso's of modern technology, his first solo album  shows Eno's ability of wonderful songwritings and great instrumental playing. Album highlighted with Eno's bizzare lyrics and quirky vocals, it's a loud rock-n-roll album with lot's of synth's and giutar's, it contains some-kind of avantgarde and art-rock type songs, killer number is a  \\"Baby's on Fire\\"  which demonstrates  Robert Fripp's strongest solo, i love  this two like minded musicians they are my most respected players and every achievment of this duo in album is perfect.    PLAY IT LOUD... Here Comes ...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have listened to many different types of music, and this CD is one of my favorites. Most people won't buy it because of Christina's new &quot;look&quot;, and they think it will be inappropriate for their children. Parents, this CD is the best and Christina couldn't have preformed better! This is a definite must-buy!
B0000009SG|5.0|It's a funny album. I have a vinyl copy (Warner Bros.) of this  amazing album, it's full of Zappaish aura and i like  his fantastic cover too. If you are'nt in the mood, buy it and Play, From songs Camarillo Brillo to Montana it gaves you strong impression with grate guitar work from  Frank and band playing.  Listen to the grate and original voice of Frank Zappa, it sensational, and  minded, full of strange stories.
1577311523|5.0|This book is a bestseller because it provides us with frame work to lifes many challenging questions. The Power of Now has differentiated for me the two things I hold in high esteem, namely my family and myself. By doing this I am in a better position to make decisions (by not intermingling these two). Another book that has proven very influential to me is Dreams: Gateway to the True Self. It's a parallel of this book in that Dreams identifies the self and provides structure to the endless sea of jargon surrounding the unconscious. Many have read both and liked what they have read.
B000002KY8|5.0|1999 is one of Prince's four classic albums (the others being DIRTY MIND, PURPLE RAIN, and SIGN O' THE TIMES) and his commercial breakthrough to a wider audience. Kicking off the classic title track with a distorted voice that intones \\"Don't worry, I won't hurt you, I only want you to have fun\\", then shifting into that unmistakable organ-synth riff, partying down in the face of imminent danger, building the voices at the end to a climax, then playing chicken-scratch funk-guitar and a childlike voice saying \\"Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?\\" before vanishing. Only Prince can comeup with sounds that match his lyrics. (Though the song seems a little dated now that it's past the year 1999, it's still too good of a song to die, and I think Prince should change the title to \\"2999\\" to keep it going for another 1000 years!!!) Anyway, as soon as the song finishes, in comes \\"Little Red Corvette\\", one of the best songs ever written about sex without actually saying it and a shifting start-stop rhythm. \\"Delirious\\" is defintely one of the goofiest-sounding songs Prince has ever made, anchored by a silly New Wave synth-line and a punk rhythm. \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" has so many sections and sounds kinda spacey and computer-like. \\"D.M.S.R.\\" is the best dance-funk song George Clinton never made, \\"Automatic\\" clocks in at nine minutes with the same rhythm that predates \\"When Doves Cry\\", and \\"Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)\\" - my favorite song here, races along on a shuffling drum machine, swelling futuristic synths, and the Purple One's nervous vocals. \\"Free\\" is a tender, inspirational ballad, \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" finds our hero running from a woman described in \\"Annie Christian\\" (from CONTROVERSY), \\"All The Critics Love U In New York\\" takes swipes at snobs, and \\"International Lover\\" is the requisite bedroom ballad. Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remsater and reissue this and all of Prince's Warner-era albums with bonus tracks. Here's what should be:<br />1.1999<BR>2. Little Red Corvette<BR>3. Delirous<BR>4. Let's Pretend We're Married<BR>5. D.M.S.R.<BR>6. Automatic<BR>7. Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)<BR>8. Free<BR>9. Lady Cab Driver<BR>10. All The Critics Love U In New York<BR>11. International Lover<BR>12. Horny Toad<BR>13. Irresistable B****<BR>14. How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore<br />Anyway, this is great music, probably some of the most futuristic-sounding music I have ever heard, that it's hard to believe that it came out 20 years ago, which shows how Prince's music was so ahead of it's time!!!

0425098478|5.0|I have pushed myself through countless management books in various U.S. Navy leadership and civilian management courses.  One Minute Manager was a required textbook for a college communication course.  I initially thought that the little book with the big print would be a waste of time.  I previewed it in a bookstore over coffee and nearly finished it before the coffee.  It reads incredibly quick and unfolds a strategy so simple and straightforward that the reader wonders why anyone would behave any differently.  I wanted to go back in time and slip it into half a dozen bosses' in boxes.  Not since Strunk and White's &quot;Element's of Style&quot; have I encountered such concise, natural-feeling instruction on things we use everyday.  This isn't just big business either - I'm seeing improvements with my four and five year old boys as well.  The look of accomplishment on their faces tells me that these ideas can work anywhere!  Required: a leader, communication, confidence, pride and praise.

055321263X|5.0|Laura Fairly is the innocent, the young, sheltered, Victorian maiden who abides by her departed father's wishes.  On his deathbed, he bids her to marry Sir Percival Glyde.  Enter villainy.  The grasping, frightened, short-tempered Sir Percival insists on a speedy wedding.  He handily dispatches any obstacles thrown up in his path; he is damned and determined to wed Laura--and her fortune.  But Laura has a sister, Marian, a strong-willed, independent, fiercely loyal sister who at first champions the marriage and then recoils once she realizes the true nature of Sir Percival.  The man is a monster.  And Marian will do anything to protect her sister.  Heroism, and then some.  There is also another, a drawing master named Walter Hartright, commissioned to teach Laura and Marian the fine art of watercolors.  He falls in love with Laura, and she with him--before her marriage to Sir Percival.  The drama should be obvious.<BR> <BR>But what of the title?  Who is the Woman in White?  Her chance meeting with Walter Hartright on the road to London provides the catalyst upon which the entire narrative turns.  She is at once and both the key and the puzzle.  She is a victim.  She is a harbinger.  She scares Sir Percival out of his wits.<BR> <BR>This book offers vivid portrayals of Victorian England, its mannerisms, its wardrobe, its inhibitions, its attitude.  This book eerily reflects our own time, our own angst, in the 21st century.  Once you read it, you'll know what I mean.  Deception has no age.<BR> <BR>P.S. Whatever you do, don't turn your back on Count Fosco!
B000002J20|5.0|it is one of the best YES albums.<BR>I have had this album since the day of release ohh so many years ago.Ive owned Lp's cassettes cd's of this one.The remastering is better this time than last time around when Atlantic &quot;remastered&quot;it...[actually they just used better master tapes and not the mediocre ones they used to release the cd origionally.]..although the Japanese CD release of this is still the best sound quality.The songs have gotten richer over the years..and yes they have gotten sillier to.....Jon was sooooo full of himself at this point but with the musicians there at the time what a great record.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe<BR>By C.S Lewis<br /> The classic book from the chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe\\", is a great fairy-tale story. The four children: Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy, are playing hide-and-go seek on a rainy day. But Lucy the explorer goes into a quiet empty room, and finds a mysterious wardrobe. So she opens the wardrobe, and there are many heavy trench coats that are filled with dust. She creeps behind the coats and finds herself shivering, so she puts on one of the coats. She slowly turns around and see, snow, trees, and a trail leading to a large and rather weird looking pole-light. <br /> She begins to walk towards the light. She spots a very weird looking man, who is half-man, half-goat. So they begin to start talking, and he kind enough to invite her to his house. So they have a cup of tea while the faun tells Lucy where she is at. Lucy begins to get a bit confused from the whole thing. Then the faun shows Lucy the mean White witch's Dreadful castle, and explains that she is really bad. So Lucy goes back and tells her brother's and sister's about Narnia and they do not believe her so Peter goes along by himself into the wardrobe. Then who knows what else is in store for them.<br /> So Edmund goes through the journey in the wardrobe. But there is a problem the wardrobe door does not work. So Edmund gives Lucy some grief for it not working. So he waits for while and tries again, but this time it does happen to work. So he begins to walk through the trail, and then Edmund runs into the White witch, and she asks him if he is a human, and he says yes. So the witch told him that if she came and is her king when she is gone she would give him Turkish-delight for life. So of course he agrees to it, and takes him to her castle. In the meantime the other 3 come through and run into the beavers, very nice couple of people. So they take them into there warm household, and begin to talk. But after a while somehow they realize the witch's servant, \\"the wolves\\" are coming after them. So then they bundle up and evacuate the house.<br /> What will happen next? It looks like you better read the book, and read it quick, before it runs out of stock, who knows what will happen next.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie, but after reading some of these reviews I did see some faults in the movie.  Who cares? The latest bunch of movies I've seen have been thrown together and quickly wrapped up where an ending should be.  This movie was fun, a little played out but alot better than I'm getting used to. <br />I liked the German girl's overuse of the word &quot;Sciezer&quot;, it kind of reminded me of Cartman's mom.

B00003CXCS|5.0|Maria (Julie Andrews) is an apprentice nun.  She truly wants to devote her life to God, but struggles with the rules.  When the Mother Abbess sends her to take care of Captain von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, she gets more then she bargained for.  The children are in desperate need of love, and she and the captain begin to fall in love as well.  Meanwhile, Austria is in danger from the advancing Nazi threat.<br />\\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of those feel good films.  I smile the entire way through it.  In my mind, it's Rogers and Hammerstein's best musical.  All the songs are easily singable and memorable.  Who doesn't know \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Do-Re-Mi,\\" or even the title song?  Yet these songs are set into a fun love story against an interesting back drop.  The movie does loose a little steam in the second act, but my only real disappointment is the cutting of two songs from the play.  \\"How Can Love Survive?\\" and \\"No Way to Stop It\\" add some fun and help flesh out the character of the Baroness.  In spite of these things, I still love the movie version, however.<br />The two disc set is a wonderful way to own this classic movie.  The picture and sound are wonderful, and the disc is packed with information.  I especially enjoyed the documentary on the second disc because it includes information on the real von Trapps.<br />If you haven't seen this classic piece of American cinema, don't hesitate.  If you're looking for the perfect disc to own, this is it.  It may be harder to track down the two disc edition, but in my mind, it's well worth it.
0151008116|5.0|I have just completed reading &quot;The Life of Pi&quot; and my overwhelming feeling is one of sadness because the book ended. I don't believe that I will find such a wondrous book to read for a long, long time.<br />&quot;The Life of Pi&quot; has humor, poetry, religion, adventure and mystery---all in 100 chapters of magical language and story telling.<br />Yann Martel was the winner of the Booker Award and he is without a doubt deserving of our admiration. I am only hopeful he will become a prolific author. I want more!<br />I will continue to think of Robert Parker and Pi for years to come. As Martel hints at the beginning of the book, fiction is a way of looking at reality. Piscine Molitor Patel unravels his story--- and at the end, given the choice between cold reality and fiction, you will choose to believe in fiction. Don't miss this book. &quot;And so it is with God.&quot; This book is a wonder.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Russell Crowe is just amazing in his part as a famous general, then a slave, then a gladiator.  While I generally do not enjoy movies with a lot of blood and gore, this movie kept me interested the whole way through.  I have watched it well over 30 times and each time I watch it I find something new, fun, and interesting that I had never seen before.  Wonderfully casted, filmed, and directed, Gladiator is EASILY the best movie ever.  WATCH IT!!
6305327084|1.0|What is the fascination with this movie, Beautiful Girls?  The acting was poor, the plot thin and the action slow.  The girls weren't even that 'Beautiful' (Rosie O'Donnell?).  As for the guys, their roles were shallow.  And the reunion?  The old 'buddies' didn't even GO to a reunion!  <br />Uma was 'too cool,' Willie was dull as a brick, Marty was a fakely deep (&quot;Let's walk this world together&quot; -gag).  The good actors included Rosie O'Donnell, Matt Dillon and Noah Emmerich, barely.<br />'Beautiful Girls' is a dry flick and characters disappear without and appear without mention (Uma, Rosie).  The music was bland and the movie had no depth.  Blah, blah, blah, you AREN'T missing out if you have not seen it.
B00005Y1MT|2.0|I tried like hell to like this album, as many internet prog fans rave about it, but after multiple listenings, I have now declared this album a total and complete dud. It is just boring. It is hard to believe that with all of the great unknown prog bands that Marillion is one of the more known ones. Lesser known prog bands like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard blow them out of the water. Do not waste your money on this unless you want music to put you to sleep. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I give Marillion credit for trying to keep the prog name alive. They just happened to fail miserably in their attempt.
0812550706|3.0|Geez, I was told that this book was so amazing and it was compared to Dan Simmons and his Hyperion series.  PLease, please, please!  This book could have been read in 3rd grade!<BR>This was such easy reading and I never really felt &quot;there&quot; in this book.  It lacks depth in character and environment.  It was, however, entertaining to read.  I continued to read the next three books and they seem to be written by a completely different person!  They are much better written but they still are not totally engrossing.  Good book(s). Not great.<BR>Those of you that truly want to be challenged on a totally magnificant level while being amazed at the story, read Hyperion!  Sorry Orson.
B00006LSM3|3.0|There's something a little gloomy about George Harrison's last album, which is a way to say it that doesn't really capture the essence of it, because obviously the guy's last album, recorded while he was dying from cancer, is not going to be a barrel of monkeys.  At the same time, it is admirable to be going out singing, as Joseph Campbell used to say, like Jesus after the Last Supper in the Gnostic Gospels, where he goes off singing and dancing, in an orgiastic celebration of the consummation of mortality.  In some ways, Harrison here is bolder, more liberated than he ever was in his earlier works, in which he always touted spirituality; derided materiality.  Now, though, he pulls no punches in calling the material world \\"Bull--it Avenue.\\"  In the same song (the title track, \\"Brainwashed\\"), the chorus could not be more in your face: \\"God! God! God!\\"  It pounds like bass drums going off to war.  It's \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\" for voice.  But, at the same time, the songs betray the desperation and the frustration of a candidate who has run out of time before the election, a salesman who did not get to close his deal.  That's the gloomy bit.<br />\\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is the sole standout song from the collection.  It has a charming, \\"For You Blue\\" quality about it that is reminiscent of that first bow-out by Beatle George (from the \\"Let It Be\\" album, the Beatles' swan song).  This time, of course, the finality is of a more permanent nature.  In a way, knowing that makes the song that much more rarified, like listening to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow//What a Wonderful World\\" (he died).  There's a longing, a bittersweet note, there.  Of course, with George Harrison, it seems perfectly normal to hear him now, as a disembodied spirit.  In his own mystic way, he always was a body raring to get ditched by his soulsonic force.  It's as if, after all these years, that cosmic soul has finally been liberated, and he sings to us nowas a pure spirit.
B000069HK2|2.0|I first heard Taste of Ink on the radio and said Wow.  Who's that?   Soon  I got to listen to the whole album and was disappointed:  Just a bunch of noisy screaming except  for one good song &quot;Taste of Ink&quot;.  For noise I would prefer Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Soundgarden, or anything but The Used.  Sorry.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Is he right next door?  NOT!  If I am at a loss for words it is because they escape me.  I could not be more pleased with this version of Jane Austen's Emma.  I will forever keep this dvd close to my heart.
038542471X|5.0|In the two years since The Firm first captured the imagination of America'a readers, John Grisham, with three consecutive number - one bestsellers, has become one of the most popular authors of our time. Now, in The Client, he has written a novel so irresistible, so thoroughly entertaining and satisfying, that it is sure not only to please his millions of fans, but to win him new ones as well.<br /> This is the story of eleven year old Mark Sway, who, as the novel opens, witnesses the bizarre suicide of a New Orleans attorney. Just before he dies, the lawyer tells Mark a deadly secret concerning the recent murder of a Louisiana Senator, whose accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno, is about to go to trial. The police, the federal prosecutor, and the FBI pressure Mark to tell them the attorney's last words, but he knows that with the mob watching his every move, revealing his secret will almost surely get him killed.<br /> So Mark, streetwise and old beyond his years, hires a lawyer: Reggie Love, a fifty - two - year- old divorcee who's been through more than anyone could imagine and survived, basically, because she's tough. And feisty. And loves helping kids overlooked or abused by the system. But when Mark's life is threatened, and Reggie discovers her office has been bugged, and even the Juvenile Court judge says Mark has no choice but to talk, she realizes that she's in way over her head. But then Mark comes up with a plan ...a crazy plan, in Reggie's opinion, but it's their only hope. And it just might work.<br /> With the page - turning suspense and terrific plot twists that have become John Grisham's trademark, he has once again crafted a novel that simply cannot be put down. But in The Client Grisham has gone a step further with a cast of unforgettable characters headed by the most original hero in years, he has mixed equal parts humor and warmth to truly expand the boundaries of the legal thriller.
0767830520|5.0|Robert De Niro is TRAVIS BICKLE, `God's lonely man', lost amid the indiscernible filth of New York City's street life with no place in the society he so detests.<BR>When Travis becomes a taxi driver he feels the weight of the degradation that surrounds him and, alone with only his twisted ideals, he feels the intense need to prove his existence, becoming obsessed with saving a schoolgirl prostitute from her pimp.Travis gets organised and the film works toward the moment he has been heading for his entire life, culminating in a brutal and bloody extension of violence.<br />A devastating picture of one man's loneliness, Taxi Driver is an astounding movie, coming from the heart of a writer experiencing the intense loneliness that is transposed into the film's lead. In short this is my all time favorite film. Scorsese has never been better and this movie contains some fantastic examples of Scorsese's originality, namely the shot which leaves Travis alone on the phone to Betsy to stare down an empty corridor; it's too painful to watch him. The scene where Travis is rocking the TV with his foot is just sincere and brilliant film making. <BR>Taxi Driver works because in this first Scorsese/ De Niro/ Schrader collaboration it seems all three managed to tune in to the same psyche, the same pathology that is examined through Travis. Schrader apparently wrote the script in one week with a gun on the table. I can see how some people don't like this movie and in terms of straight-forward non-demanding action I guess it could be seen as quite slow. But to be watched as a building and perfect portrayal of loneliness and alienation this movie is the greatest. It really annoys me to see DeNiro in some of the...films he does these days after seeing how incredible he can be on the screen. I think everyone should watch this movie and I think most people will really enjoy it.
6305428522|3.0|This is the Robert Redford's best movie in my opinion.  He does a great job with the period and the gets a great cast led by Ralph Fiennes to tell a personal story of Quiz Show scandals.  The bad guys are maybe too bold about their predictions of the future, because Redford knows the future already, but otherwise the movie flows nicely with the main characters facing all sorts of moral dilemmas, and answering them as they come along.<br />The problem with the DVD is that is has nothing special to offer.  It has no commentary or making-of segment, and not even one of those documentaries on the real scandals.  You can pick it up cheap now or wait until somebody releases a special edition of this fine movie.
1573301183|5.0|If you like any kind of rock and roll at all, you will LOVE this.
B000009EAD|3.0|While this album has many great hooks, excellent vocals, and some very good songs, I can't believe the amount of hype around Iced Earth.  Songs like &quot;Stand Alone&quot; show their style off well, but I can't see how they get mentioned in the same breath as Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, and even Iron Maiden (!?) when the style of song writing is so much more simplistic and conventional (not to mention some really cheesy lyrics).  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to hear good hooks, but I think it is one of those metal albums that doesn't have enough depth to intellectually occupy one's interest for an extended period of time.  Blind Guardian is catchier AND smarter, but I see way more Iced Earth shirts at your average metal show.
0553801511|5.0|First off: if you're a fantasy lover who's never read Robin Hobb before - or even if you're a non-fantasy reader who thinks fantasy books are too unrealistic for your taste -- do yourself a  favor and go read \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" right now. Right. Now. <br />For those who have read Hobb before: <br />This book is her best since \\"Royal Assassin.\\" It's a splendid follow-up to her earlier series and easily surpasses the last Fitz book (which, though it was a pleasant return to the character, lacked a sweeping plot). Be warned, this is more of a \\"nefarious plot and royal intrigue\\" book than a slam-bang action riot - although there's one excellent action scene that shows us the deadly Fitz of old is back in business. <br />\\"Golden Fool\\" begins a few days after the end of \\"Fool's Errand.\\" Grieving from the loss of Nighteyes, Fitz has to reintegrate into Buckkeep as \\"Tom Badgerlock\\" while avoiding the threat of assassination by the Witted Piebalds who survived the last book. There's more to Prince Dutiful's betrothed than meets the eye, and plots are afoot that even a cunning ex-assassin and the increasingly erratic Chade can't protect the Farseers from. <br />I liked the way the previous books haunt the background of this one. Old characters return, often with emotionally-devastating consequences as Fitz sees the effect his death has had on those he loves. The legend of the Wit-Bastard also dogs his steps as he sees himself proclaimed as a Witted hero by enemies and allies alike, at the same time that rumors of his survival come back into circulation. Meanwhile, Fitz's determination not to repeat mistakes made in his royal assassin days sometimes helps avert a crisis, and sometimes leads him to make new mistakes.<br />I'd recommend buying this book, even in hardcover, and I'm not much of a book buyer. What pushes it over the top for me is that there's a lot of emotional payoff from storylines left hanging from the last book and the original assassin series. Fitz's character has matured a lot, and though he is still capable of making disastrous mistakes, he's getting better at handling the routine demands placed on him by the Six Duchies and the Farseer family. Dutiful is also maturing into a very likable youth, and his growing relationship with Fitz makes for an enjoyable read. <br />The characterizations are as powerful as ever; be warned, however, that the cameos from The Liveship Trader books are quite substantial here. You can read the book without having read Hobb's other trilogy, but it's better if you have. <br />I give this one 5 stars.
0815411839|1.0|This book steals(?), borrows, from previous biographers detailing the Birth, life and death of Marilyn Monroe.  There are a lot of allegations, theories as to what \\"REALLY HAPPENED\\" to MM. I noticed a lot of reviewers seemed caught up in believing that this author backed up his theories, but check again boys and girls...It presents a very one-sided view of what Pat Newcomb allegedly told Donald Spoto, as well as the other interviewees sited.  I checked out the claims made by this author at the Academy Library in Los Angeles, where he deposited his so-called interview tapes and the tapes tell the truth and that is NOT what is printed in this book. The first thing Pat Newcomb tells this author is \\"look, I was not Marilyn's best friend\\"....and goes on to not say much of anything. In all the interviews I listened to, it is Donald Spoto doing the talking while his interview subjects listen.  The so-called documents proclaimed to be used in this book, never existed.  Much of this was fabricated and never produced for review.  Read any of the earlier books/bios on Marilyn and you will get a clearer picture of what she was really like.  Many, many so called factual mistakes are made.  Not worth the trouble.

They became cultural icons with this release ('And you may ask yourself...!!!')Taking the ingredients of New Wave, Soul, World New Age and blending these elements masterfully, they provided an avenue for many multi-tasking musical artists to wander down while creating a large & diverse listenership.

0375823352|2.0|Let us hear it for the most open-minded statement of the century.<br />\\"She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority [God] and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\"<br />So let us analyze this. It is saying that, A. Christians are stupid, and B. Christians are closed-minded. Oh now I finally understand the true meaning of open-mindedness. It is to believe whatever Philip Pullman believes, right? Because obviously all Christians are repressed, homophobic, brainwashed, [people], who do not question what the Church tells them to do. Philip Pullman is a wonderfully eloquent author, whose writing is absolutely beautiful, but that doesn't make him correct. He needed to do his research more carefully. In the Bible it clearly states \\"Question Everything,\\" now maybe not all churches put that to the forefront of every sermon, but that phrase is there none the less.<BR>The most annoying thing about this book is though that Philip Pullman obviously thinks that he is open-minded, and it seems that many people agree. It seems that every other religion has protection, and if he had chosen to pick on any religion other than Christianity he would never, and I mean NEVER, have gotten away with it. Why is it alright to say that my religion is wrong? Why is it alright to say that all Christians are evil, or stupid (for there is not one sympathetic Christian in the entire book)? I know that my religion has it's problems, and brings some things upon itself (the whole \\"Harry Potter is evil\\" thing is ridiculous), but that does not mean that people can just blatantly disregard the fact that ALL religions deserve respect.<BR>I gave this book 2 stars because it is genuinely well written (though not as well written as the previous two books in the series), and gripping. But I must say that it did get thrown across my room several times because of the blatant bias that it was written from.
B00005OAIE|1.0|This is the pinnacle of fluff-pop. How can you call this guy a singer-songwriter? I'm sure Gordon Lightfoot, Cat Stephens and the other great singer-songwriters are all slapping themselves against the head wishing the could have come up with...\\"your body is a wonderland\\" & \\"I wanna swim in a sea of blankets\\" or whatever the hell he's saying. Please folks....don't be fooled by this imposter. If you want a great singer-songwriter album, both musically and lyrically, try Beck's \\"Sea Change.\\"

B00003CXXM|3.0|Very little I guess. This film is really not worth buying beacause it has almost nothing to do with the book. I cannot believe they made this movie without using most of the key elements from the book! As it stands, the movie is not that bad, but it could have been alot better. You know what would have been better: Jet Li starring in this film. He's a better actor than Matt Damon, he would have been more believable in the role than Damon and the fight scenes would have been 20 times better.
0151008116|1.0|This is the first Booker Prize winning book I've read that disappointed me.  I can see why the book is popular.  I have read more than my share of boy's eye adventure stories. However, they are all pretty boring to an adult reader.  The overlay of puerile pop theology in this novel -- based on a false claim to incorporate all of the world religions -- is more than annoying:  I find myself insulted by it. On to something interesting.
B00000J7S8|2.0|A friend's rave, a nice review in the local paper, and air play on the local smooth jazz station motivated me on this &quot;impulse&quot; purchase. Sadly, the shining reviews and serious and repeated play does not lift Krall's performance and production of this album above the hype.<br />Krall treaded dangerous grounds by going up against the giants who originally performed these standards. Unfortunately, in comparison, she doesn't bring anything new or better to the table. Her vocal competence is not challenged here. Indeed, Krall is technically proficient. Hints of Carmen McCrae waft about during play but what is lacking is the obvious emotion and distinction that made the originals so appealing. Some tracks are sterile of the oozing passions that have made standards standards.<br />And where is Nelson Riddle when you need him? The CD suffers from an underwhelming lack of orchestral production that, nearly on its own, lifted Linda Ronstadt's classic standards album to lofty heights. Only the final cut &quot;Why Should I Care?&quot;, my favorite on the CD, makes an attempt at full-on orchestration that is so needed but missing from this collection.<br />Perhaps if Ms. Krall finds a good writer or even writes her own material and combines that with good arrangement and a big band, she could easily meet the hype that seems to surround her.
B000068QY7|4.0|Having 'discovered' Oasis only after the release of 'Shoulder of Giants', I spent the intervening period between 'Giants' and 'Heathen Chemistry' getting acquainted with the older Oasis. So, I eagerly awaited 'Chemistry', as it would be my first 'new' Oasis album. I was not disappointed.<BR>Let's take it track-by-track:<BR>1)The Hindu Times: Enough has been said about it, so I'll just say that it's a great new Oasis anthem.<BR>2)Force of Nature: Not very imaginatively written, but I love the way the guitar answers each line in the latter half.<BR>3)Hung in a Bad Place: Perhaps my favourite. Simple, straightforward, 100% British, Rock'n'Roll.<BR>4)Stop Crying..:A beautiful ballad, with Will 'The Verve' Malone on strings.<BR>5)Songbird: Short, Acoustic/Organ driven Liam composition. I love it for it's sheer simplicity. Liam sounds exactly like Lennon on this one.<BR>6)Little by Little: Great, great ballad. Maybe even an Oasis epic.<BR>7)A Quick Peep: Fun, rockin' instrumental. <BR>8)All in the mind: I don't see why people are complaining. It's actually quite good.<BR>9)She is Love: One of the album's highlights. I love the Organ, and the clapping gives it a warm ambience.<BR>10)Born on a Different cloud: Is it Oasis? Or the Fab Four? <BR>11)Better Man: Not really a lyrical masterpiece, but it might work for some people. Not for me. <BR>Then, we have the inexplicable 30 minutes of dead silence, followed by four or five minutes of an instrumental. It isn't really worth the wait; Fast forward, if you want to listen to it.<BR>All in all, I can't see myself telling anyone to not buy it, but if you're a new Oasis fan, the you'll be better off buying the older albums first, to put this one in context. I cut one star, because it's really too short.
0062502182|2.0|*The Alchemist* is a simple fable with no conventional plot. Santiago is an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. He deliberately leaves Spain and starts a thousand-mile journey to Egypt to literally follow his dream. As promised in his unqiue dream, Santiago bumps into &quot;spiritual messengers&quot; to point him to the right direction and more importantly, to spur him on toward his destination. Santiago then meets a well-read Englishman, in whose book he learns about the alchemists: men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the &quot;Soul of the World.&quot; Eventually Santiago meets a true alchemist who emboldens him to stay true to his dream. To me this book seems a little monotonous and at points I am in fact bored by the reading. I read it at the first place out of the curiosity that this very novel has been translated to more than 40 languages. The question of whether this story of simplicity is dazzling or boring leaves entirely to the readers. What I really hate is that after spending all the time reading I am left with an ambiguous ending. 2.5 stars.
0553801511|5.0|I finished the Fools's Errand in two days and ran to buy the Golden Fool immediately n finished it a day and a half!<br />Robin's writing is incredible - the plot is superb, unusual(not just the same old sorcery-fight-against-evil stuff) and poignant (My eyes have watered a few times)at the same time. One can't help but love each and everyone of the characters(the good guys of course)!  After reading this book, I went to rummage my bookshelves for the Farseer trilogy and the Madship trilogy just to refresh and enjoy them all over again!
0780624890|5.0|This movie was a feast for the action-oriented audience. Wesley Snipes was a great casting decision for the role of Blade. This marvel comic character turned live-action film star. This movie prides itself on its bloodbath scenes. If you like vampire movies and want better special effects than those cheap Sci-Fi films this is a great movie for you. I gave it five out of five stars because it gave me everything I expected from it.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Well deserved 5.1 audio (turn up that bass) and a crystal picture. Buy it soon to get the bonus DVD that's limited to the first couple thousand prints. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS: we shall get ALL seasons. hooray. There was some doubt apparently. Hopefully  Voyager will get on the slate for 2004. This is an awesome collection and DS9 is thee quintessential late-night sci-fi for me. I ended up appreciating it even more than TNG by the end of season 5. It's the most entertaining and engrossing show I've ever seen with original, fantastic stories. Unbelievable set.
B000002H5I|5.0|Great art grows in stature with time.  So it is with this.  These songs are so thoroughly profound and so emotionally resonant as to almost defy description.  But they don't defy meaning...and that's what makes them such great folk music.  Their meaning is all too evident and once again reinforce the idea that keen human observation and adherence to truth are what great art are all about.  Like so many others I return to this music time and time again for all sorts of reasons.  Thank God for Tracy Chapman.

0743424425|5.0|I highly recommend this book! I've never read any Stephen King novels before, but I am very impressed with this one. It was written in the 70's, but I only just finished reading it three days ago--and I'm reading it again. There are a few books that I can just read over and over again, and this is definetly one of them. It's very scary, even more than the movie is, and also much more detailed than the movie--plus it makes more sense. The characters are so believably written that you start to feel like you really know them. The Hotel is the greatest evil in this book, and everything about it is bad. I don't want to give anything away but I think this book is brilliant because it draws you into the plot--quite a complex plot, but not overly difficult to read. Very vivid. I think Mr. King is a brilliant author if he can write this well. <BR>Read it now--this book will really scare you, and even though it's weird, a few tiny parts will actually catch you by surprise and really make you laugh out loud, if that's possible in a horror book. At the beginning, there's so much optimistic hope for the Torrance family that I found myself hoping that they wouldn't be swallowed up by the evils of the Overlook Hotel. Of course, it's obviously almost inevitable, which makes them all seem doomed. The Overlook is realisticly described, with its terror right in there. This is probably one of my favorite books...
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have not seen this film until recently. I never really cared for this film nor for its leading star, Mr. Russell Crowe. But I happened to be in Blockbuster and I passed by this DVD so I picked it up only to quench my curiosity over why it was named Best Picture. I was amazed at how wonderful 'A Beautiful Mind' turned out. Of course, I liked Ron Howard's past movies 'Apollo 13', 'Backdraft', 'Gung Ho', 'Cocoon', 'Splash' and 'Nightshift', so my expectations were particularly high.<br />Russell Crowe amazed me as he delivered a very good performance as John Nash, a mentally disturbed mathematician genius at Princeton University. Jennifer Connelly reached her all time career peak as the woman Nash falls in love with and has to deal with her husbands problem. The movie is haunting, dark, funny at times, and very touching. I don't really know whether the movie dramatizes too much for movie purposes, but it sure unfolds very well. The makeup work is one of the highlights of the movie. Ed Harris is surprising in his role. <br />In no way is 'A Beautiful Mind' boring nor is it dumb. It sparks excellent performances and a beautiful character-actor picture.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />A
0679882820|5.0|This was my favorite book as a small child, it was my son's favorite book when he was a toddler (he's now 11), and now my daughter is 19 months-and, yep, she adores it!  She has entered the 'mimicking' phase, so she loves hearing me make all those sounds, and then she copies Mom, er, 'Mr. Brown',  and we giggle through every page. This book has made a bigger impression than 'Pat the Bunny' or 'Goodnight Moon' in our house!
0321146530|5.0|The are a small number of writers who can teach programming skills effectively.  Kent Beck is one of them.  There are a small set of practices that you can adopt on your own that will have an clearly observable impact on the quality of your results and the quality of your work day. Test Driven Develoment (TDD) is one of them. If you are a software developer, you want to buy, read and study this book.<br />TDD fits development into a three micro-phase cycle: create a test that embodies your requirement, write code that passes the test, make the code run clean. Each phase has different goals, patterns and pitfalls.  Like any good coach, Beck walks you through these in detail.  He uses multiple examples: most notably a business model in Java and a unit testing framework in Phython.  He follows up with a question and answer section that reviews common patterns in test driven development cycle.  <br />The level of learning involved in doing TDD is profound. The best way to read the book is to do the book.  Skills come from doing not reading.  I did the examples (in another language) and it made all the difference in what I learned.<br />A footnote for managers: TDD is the opening wedge for a set of practices known as extreme programming (XP) or agile development.  Test driven development is powerful enough to work on its own for the single delevoper.  If you want to realize its full value, however, you need to embrace the full set of XP practices for the whole organization.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is by far the best album that the Chili Peppers have put out.  I can understand why the hard core RHCP fans aren't enthused with this album - it's a far cry from the \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" days, but I view it as the normal progression of the Peppers maturing in their musical vision.  The song styles pick up where \\"Californication\\" left off, but they've polished the sound and crafted a near-full 16 hit tracks.  I've literally had this CD in my player for 4 weeks straight without pulling it out - it's that good.  Instantly catchy melodies are backed by solid, if not strong, lyrics.  The wild days of the Peppers may be over, but the new sound they've crafted is a more than acceptable substitute.  The dark side to this album?  It'll be very difficult to follow this up with a similar collection.  If the Peppers pull off another set of tracks as good as this, they've earned a free ride for the rest of their careers.
B00007L7FN|4.0|I thought Atem wasn t nearly the musical 'work' done on Zeit.  It is good.  It is like the soft aftermath of the HUGE Zeit.  <BR>The positive things of Atem ar the title track; long and full of interesting compositions.  The soft theme continues w Fauni Gena.  Soft and at the same time, drawing on some sounds and instruments as the first track.  The third track 'Circulation of events'.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the music done on Zeit but very original and very refreshing.<br />Finally the Wahn, which translated to English means Mania, is just that.  A very crazy sounding track that I would leave you to listen and give your thoughts on.<br />This is a essential TD record to own.
B000002J23|1.0|Who knows what caused the rift, but somehow after &quot;Tormato&quot; YES had fallen apart, perhaps by virtue of having run out of ideas and patience with keyboard players. So Chris Squire sought to soldier on with Steve Howe and Alan White and recruited 2 session player/producers to alter the formula. They did. But actually, only the traditional YES vehicle, Tempus Fugit, cuts the mustard. The rest is forgettable. <BR>Everyone is a fine musician here, it's just that this does not click. The disaster would become compounded when Anderson regrouped with Bruford, Wakeman, and again Howe to release a YES album in all but name. And to rub salt in Squire's wound, employing Tony Levin among others for bass duties. <BR>If you are a completist, then perhaps this is worth it. Yes had great moments, bloated moments, and horrendous missteps. This is the real low point. They would come close to this edge later with &quot;Talk&quot;, but &quot;Drama&quot; makes one nostalgic for Patrick Moraz, the George Lazenby of progressive keyboard players. Give Downes and Horn credit for knowing when to leave.
0792839749|3.0|As others have stated, I intended to buy this DVD, until I realized it's &quot;reformatted for your screen.&quot;  I have a DVD in standard format -- I want widescreen, again because so much of the movie is missing when it's reformatted.  I'll wait.
B00000DRXW|5.0|This album changed my view of jazz when I was 16 years old. Knowing about Return to Forever, Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra I'd never had the inclination to listen at this age. But our local college radio station had several jazz buffs as DJs, in addition to rock musicians looking to stretch their scope of influence who would play cuts from this and the other above groups' albums in between their trips of fancy in the Alternative Music scene. Phenominal music listened to individually as cuts on the airwaves, I rushed out and bought the album eager to have my boundaries stretched.<br />I wasnt disappointed, and even listening to it today I find that I hear new things each time. The improvisational sections (of which there are many) have recognizable themes mixed into free form playing which astound. The pieces that are full on compositions will leave you humming the chief theme melody for days after. The power that is derived just from three guitars in the hands of three very powerful players will leave you breathless.<br />If you're a musician young or old looking for something to stretch your limits and defy the concept you have of guitar, buy the album. As a jazz lover who can appreciate ingenious improvisation, buy the album. I cant recommend this album enough.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Since the Social Club I have been waiting for another Ry Cooder exceptional production. Mambo Sinuendo is it. I gave up counting the number of times I have played it through. Learning new nuances each time. The guitar work by Manuel Galban is new to me and the musicianship is outstanding. Cooder has made another gem. I am not a reviewer, but I want other people to experience this work.

B0000025JT|5.0|When this LP came out in the early eighties I was only 15 and <BR>already a big fan of the Brothers Gibbs whom I thought were an<BR>incredibly talented trio. <BR>I then listened to this album ( and have been listening to it <BR>ever since on one format or another ) and my opinion of the trio<BR>soared to even greater hieghts! <BR>Can anyone debate the exceptional talent of Barry, Robin and<BR>Maurice Gibb. They have managed to create some of the most <BR>memorable songs in history of which this album is a <br />significant and magical contribution.<BR>The melodies, lyrics, lead and background vocals on every cut<BR>of this album are pure magic. A pop sensation!<BR>An album that has endured for 23 years and is still as moving and <BR>enchanting as when it was released.<BR>With so many forgettable tunes being released by mediocre artists <BR>flooding our senses it's always refreshing to sit back and listen <BR>this album and remember a time when true talent shined at its brightest.

0553260111|4.0|I have not read many of the late Robert Ludlum's novels, but this was a good place to start and I plan to read some more. Terrific action and characters; my only complaint would be that the book is actually overly complex and un-neccesarily so. The movie producers tried to remedy that by removing most of the best characters, such as the doctor in France and the retired general and his traitorous wife. They even took out Carlos and his henchmen and the Treadstone team. The left-over characters would be sufficient for a half dozen sequels and a weekly TV show!<br />Some would question whether one man could be shot this many times and continue operations but I dont like to worry about anatomical details. Ludlum is clearly a master of this genre, superheroes fighting many shadowy enemies in non-stop action, supported by one-dimensional female love interests, apparently based on 1940's movie stars. Dont look for any political intrigue or thrilling technical information. Ludlum tries to conjure up some international political and financial storylines and then seems to lose interest in them without completion. <br />Ludlum's true genius shows in the way he reveals the story to us.  Bourne has lost most of his memory in one of the many times that he is shot. The reader also steps into the story cold and learns page by page, who is Bourne and how did he get here. The movie does not handle this well, as it is too quick to get to the love interest and the battle with Bourne's former managers.

Sony sells 8Mb memory sticks for a fraction of the price( infact you can get 32Mb memory sticks for the same price and they must be harder to make because their smaller about 1/6 the size) what sony should have done is what they do for every other computer device they make and put a memory stick slot(of course they need the memory card slot for the backwards compatablility and all but make new memory cards and try and sell them for that much that's a ...!!! and anybody with a PS2 has to put up with it, or not save their game.
B000000WFF|4.0|When this cd and the other Spice Girls cd first came out I hated them with all my might.  This was mainly due to the fact that it was all that my sister played it non-stop and obsessed over the movie and everything. I thought if I see one more thing Spice related I would scream. Then she moved on to new horrors: N'Sync and The Backstreet Boys.  I thought to myself , \\"the Spice Girls were better than this, and they were hot.\\" That was the beginning of my reform.  <br />Recently, one day on our way home from school, my sister was feeling nostalgic and begged me to let her listen to Spiceworld. After listening to the cd the whole way through I realized that it wasn't that bad. There were some good songs such as \\"Stop\\" and \\"Spice Up Your Life\\".  <br />Nothing could have prepared me, however, for the pure pop magic that is \\"Never Give Up on the Good Times.\\" Don't get me wrong, I am generally not any big fan of pop (my favorite cd's this year were Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" and The Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\") but when it is done right a pop song can be a beautiful thing. \\"Never Give Up on the Good Times\\" is exactly that.  It has an extremely catchy and fun tune, fun and upbeat lyrics, and above all, it never gets old.  I have been listening to this song again and again and again and I have not gotten sick of it. <br />\\"Never Give Up on the Good Times\\" is a sublime example of a great pop song that unfortunately does come around too often.  It helped me wise up to the point of the Spice Girls and the reason why their music succeeds. They were never about artistry in music, they were only about sheer fun and that is what this cd (the other one is a little hit and miss) and their hysterically random movie provide to their listeners and viewers respectively. N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys could never ever do that. (In addition to not being able to pull off the miniskirts that also contribute to the fun of the Spice Girls)

B00006LI4S|5.0|Now this is what a music DVD should be like... great performances, great sound and great extras.<br />Gilmour reworks some Pink Floyd classics to marvelous effect, including two different performances of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, both of which are excellent. I was caught off guard with my first listen to &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; as it is mostly a solo performance by Gilmour and his Taylor acoustic guitar, sounding more raw and immediate than the Floyd version... It quickly grew on me, though, and now I love the performance.<br />Bonus features on the disc include &quot;Spare Digits&quot;, a collection of close-ups of Gilmour's hands as he plays the guitar solos from a number of the songs. Also included are 3 bonus song performances, including  a 1992 blues version of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; with Mica Paris and Jools Holland.<br />This DVD will definitely see regular rotation in my player.
0060930349|3.0|The edition of this book that I read (1997, paperback) was fascinating, but poorly edited. It is refreshing to read about the U.S. from an outsider's perspective and I found the text engaging in that regard. However, it is full of countless typos that should have been caught by any self-respecting copy editor. That so many copy-editing errors were allowed to slip by makes me wonder whether the book was properly fact-checked as well, and if the other reviewers here are correct, it sounds like it wasn't.

B0000508U6|3.0|My friend was really gung-ho that I listen to this album.  He knows my taste; the awesome pull of Radiohead sucked me in, appealing to my hours spent with Pink Floyd (sober).  Sigor Ros, Granddaddy, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, and lately, Celia Cruz.<br />Needless to say, I like sensitive, lyrical, music, textured perfectly with appropriate rythm and curious guitar.  I like creative young bands, but sooner or later they have to master the fundamentals.  When they do that, the whole mix will flirt and play.<br />Onto Coldplay.  This album just won't get off the ground for me.  It's like the artist started with a dirty easle, on a used canvas, and smeared a lot of popular influences into a nominal exercise in alterna-pop.<br />I hear guitars borrowed from Corgan, a predictable cadence, competant chord work, and an overall song structure that must have come from a big thick record-company manual.  It just does not appeal to anything inside me; anything that makes me like those other bands.<br />Save your money and buy Agaetis Byrjun by Sigor Ros, or if you want a little fun, buy Sophtware Slump from Grandaddy.  Mix those together and you've got about 5 times the content of this Coldplay album.
B000002552|1.0|I like both The Band and Bob Dylan, but I find this album quite forgettable and grossly overrated.  The title is appropriate, both because of the poor sound quality and the fact that none of it was worthy of original publication.  There's only one song, Katie's Been Gone, that I care to ever hear again.  Maybe there's some historical interest in it, but I think the album is a bore.
B00005QDW5|5.0|One of the greatest bands ever (not to mention one of the best-selling) gets a long-awaited tribute with all their very best songs. Unlike bands like Nirvana who released a greatest hits package way too soon ..... Pink Floyd waited years and years so that another generation could experience the incredible concept that influenced everyone since them. The only thing about this compilation is that it has a greatest hits feel rather than an album feel that you can experience in Dark Side of the Moon.  However, for first time fans, this is a great way to start your Pink Floyd collection.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Pretty damn close. The first time I listened to this record, I wasn't too fond of it. I bought it for the title track, which is a bit different from the rest of the record. If you keep listening to it, it gets more perfect everytime. Buy this record and take good care of it. In 50 years, you will still want to listen to it. The best album by 'The only band that matters', might very well be the greatest album ever created. It certainly is in the top 10.

B000058T5E|1.0|Just awful.... sorry. This was my first Jeff Beck cd. I was expecting to hear some great guitar tone and amazing riffs, and interesting hard rock guitar-related music. What I actually got was not identifiable as music in any traditional sense, certainly no identifyable guitar music. Instead, a way out pyro-technic auditory &quot;junkyard&quot; ....a series of irritating sonic trainwrecks producing an instant throbbing headache and sensations of a sound mixing board being eaten by giant guitar-wielding nuclear rats with blazing red eyes. But that's what I get for not advance-listening to some &quot;sound bytes&quot; first.
6305892288|1.0|This is a marginal film to begin with however, this version is the soft version which makes it even worse. Lets face it , you are not buying this video because of the outstanding special effects. Dont waste your time buying this version on the film.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|This movie has a ... long drawn out ending,that makes me really despise it.i won't give it away,but up until that point i found it mildly interesting,and kinda clever.and then it truly drops the ball at the end,Thumbs down big time.The director never explains this glaring plot point,awful.
B000068TPN|3.0|Having read two books about the battle of Ia Drang and having corresponded occasionally with Joe Galloway, I was very excited to get my hands on the DVD of \\"We Were Soldiers.\\"  Maybe it was because my expectations were so high that I was ultimately disappointed in the film.  I was not surprised that much of Galloway's book is missing from the film, it would have been impossible to include all the detail about each of the soldiers that makes the book so personal and powerful.  I was also not disappointed by the decision to leave out the fight at LZ Albany, again in the interest of time.  What bothered me were all the classic Hollywood combat cliches that made it into the film.  Randall Wallace spent so much time making sure they had the correct kind of red filter on Col. Moore's flash light, but had no problem turning the North Vietnamese Regulars into screaming, banzai-charging stereotypes straight out of \\"Sand of Iwo Jima.\\"  Other cliches included:  Enemy incapable of operational planning at all; no tactics on either side more sophisticated than suicide charges; all rear-eschelon personnel that are lying, stupid, stuffed shirts; everyone fighting shoulder to shoulder at ranges of 10 meters or less; blood squirting in slow motion from the start of the action to the end -- even when the end is three days later; explosions that are little balls of flame that don't injure anyone more than 6 feet away; soldiers wives that are all super-models; gratuitous references to George Armstrong Custer and the Little Big Horn; and finally the totally fictitious bayonet charge led by Col Moore into the NVA HQ.<br />   Things they could have put into the film that would have improved the drama significantly:  General Chu Huy Man's Western Highlands Field Front HQ planning the Tay Nguyen campaign that led to the fight in the Ia Drang valley -- this would have explained why there were 3 NVA regiments in the area and why they fought so hard; the pride the 3rd Brigade/7th Cav took in being called the Garry Owen Brigade -- this would have explained the unit esprit de corps; General Kinnard and Col. Brown's role -- this would have explained what the 3/7 was doing in the Ia Drang; more on the air and artillery liason officers who played such key roles (there was a tiny bit in the film about Batteries B & C, 1st Battn, 21st Artillery) -- this would have explained how 3 air cav battns (not one as depicted in the movie) could hold off 3 regmts for 3 days; finally and most importantly, the loneliness and isolation of the modern battlefield -- this would have explained the real heroism of the men on the ground.<br />   I'm glad that this movie didn't fall into the stock Hollywood Vietnam War cliches recycled out of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" or \\"Platoon,\\" and overall it wasn't a bad movie, but I'm still waiting for them to get combat right.
020161622X|3.0|I bought the book after reading the preface, only to find that all the good stuff is in the preface and the first chapter. Everything after that, you could find in any introductory computing text, but it's presented here as though the authors discovered it themselves five minutes ago. The resulting tone is a little too pedantic, and the material is really nothing new.
0783225970|2.0|Just how can this cartoon gangster film ever be compared to the majestic Godfather films?  All of its characters are just totally deplorable 1980s style money grabbers with no sense of dignity or style.  The whole film is unpleasant to watch, unlike the Godfathers.  It's definitely a case of style over substance.  There is no resonance in this film.  The most dislikable characters ever to hit the screen.  A really average and dated film: the 1980s were really that bad...
6302548195|5.0|If you liked this documentary, you must see STANDTALL featuring Lou Ferrigno.<br />Available exclusively on LouFerrigno.com<br />&quot;Better than Pumping Iron, fantastic, I loved it!&quot; - Joe Gold<br />&quot;Inspiring from beginning to end&quot; - Rolling Stone<br />Review: Had Lou Ferrigno not retired in 1975 to pursue an acting career, critics argue that he would have been the most dominate competitor the world had ever seen! Now, nearly twenty years later and 325 pounds, &quot;Big Louie's&quot; unprecedented return to bodybuilding is a story of personal triumph, as he faces his fears and Boyer Coe in the &quot;Mr. Olympia&quot; competition at the age of 43.
B000069HKH|5.0|This work rivals &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot; as his all-time masterpiece; a stunningly cohesive set of music that reveals Springsteen the artist at his best: focused, empathetic and eerily in-tune with the emotions, joys, tragedies and triumphs of his audience.<BR> <BR>And like on &quot;Darkness&quot;, most of the songs slowly work their way under the skin to remain as touch points; always present and never forgotten. 'Your Missing' for example depicts the melancholy pain of loss in a deceptively simple fashion that cuts deep; revealing the void left when a loved one is snatched away and all about them that was taken for granted is gone forever.<BR> <BR>And again, much like &quot;Darkness&quot;, the songs as presented on the album are really only &quot;first-drafts&quot; that continue to grow in stature - becoming refined and strengthened when played live with the E Street Band. Their interpretation of 'Worlds Apart' played in St. Paul on 9/30/02 brought even greater dimension to the moody, mystical vibe of the recorded version, and 'Further On Up The Road' from the same concert was a snarling powerhouse.<BR> <BR>Yes this collection was influenced by the 911 tragedies, and why not? The Boss has always drawn inspiration from his friends, family and community. When the sun rises on New York City, the shadows cast are towards New Jersey; and when its two biggest shadows were senselessly obliterated, you'd better believe that Bruce Springsteen would respond. That he did so in such a thoughtful and eloquent fashion is a marvel. This is a great album by a great artist.
0141301066|5.0|Oh wow! I really can't stop reading this book! The title of this book is Matilda, Roald Dahl.  If you like adventure, believe in magic, and have maybe read other Roald Dahl books, then maybe you'll like this book as much as I do.  This book is a little bit frightening.  It's about a young girl, about six or five, and her name is Matilda.  She is really smart and can make things move with her eyes! I like this book because the author of this book uses a lot of funny writing,and, there is lots of dialogue,too.So this is a good choice for you!

B000002N9L|3.0|Is what the artist stated in the inside of the sleeve of this uproarious composition. This is a CD for cult Prince collectors,nothing more. There are no outstanding beats on this cd this is all Rock N Roll basically! This is some of the most bland DE VOID of soul Prince music I have ever heard. \\"Dinner with Deloros\\" is a nice country and western mid tempo, that really sounds like he is trying to aggrevate WB's at the time! He sings on this track like he doesn't really care about the song. With lyrics like \\"LIKE A BRONASARIOUS SHE WAS PACKING IT IN !\\" You know he is just doing this to be funny and not serious ! This marks the time when he wore the all black trinches and the black sunglasses with SLAVE painted on his face! This marks the bland piano performances he was doing to really get out of his contract! This is the last album to fulfill his contractual agreement with WB, and it is amuzing! This is a fun album to listen to just to see how he was really trying to be funny, but it actually turned out pretty good. This is basically a Prince clowning around effort with some creativity. This cd is O.K if you like rock..the stand outs are.<br />\\"I like it there\\"<BR>\\"Into the light \\"<BR>\\"Dinner with Deloros\\"<BR>\\"Dig u better Dead\\" (The only hint at the Funk on this cd)<BR>\\"I will\\"<BR>\\"Had U\\" (.A nice outro that is typical sleezy from prince.)<br />The rest is foolishness in my opinion !<br />Just someone that is talented that just wants to ... his record label off!
B00000I8UF|5.0|If you like jazz, specifically that blazin' hard bop music from the late 50s/early 60s, this is a CD to buy and play over and over again. I originally bought this CD back in the late 80s, and now that it's part of the Rudy Van Gelder Remasters, I had to buy it again (it's so funny that only jazz and classical music gets the 24-bit treatment, a more expensive process and yet these divisions of the record labels probably add the least to the bottom line).<br />I could go over the track listing, moment by moment, but I think Leonard Feather's insightful liner notes say it all, and to know what those are you have to buy the CD.<br />Blakey is wonderful as always in this period, Lee Morgan (maybe one of the best hard bop trumpeters ever) shines brightly with his blistering skills on the trumpet, and Bobby Timmons craft some musical gems on this dis here album.<br />Check it out, you won't be disappointed. And while you're at it, pick up Blakey's Free For All and Indestructable! Additional Blue Note Classics that need the RVG Superbit remaster.
B00000JLWW|5.0|*sigh*..I am sorry that I am adding my totally worthless review to the billions that are already here. Apart from the fact that I fell in love with Leo when I saw this movie (and my crush has just started again coz of 'Catch Me If You Can') I really do think this is a good movie. If it had another male lead who was totally ugly and charmless I would have still loved this movie. Even though I'm a soppy romantic and love the romance part of the movie (I know a thousand people will now hate me for admitting this) the historic part is exremly interesting. This movie has just given a whole generation facts about one of the most major tragdies of the 20th century. What people tend to forget with major Hollywood historic pictures, is yes, sometimes the history is changed around and sugercoated but at the basis, there is basic historical facts that will interest and educate many people. Titanic is one of these movies. When the movie first came out, I suddenly fell in love with the legend of Titanic and actually collected loads of facts. Even if I'm the only person in the entire world who did this, at least one person was affected by this movie! And isn't that what movie are really about? Making people happy and/or sad and being an enjoyable pastime. Because that's what Titanic is for me.
0028643151|5.0|This book was a true page turner, and I literally did not put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. Most of the subjects interested me, but ALL of the various scenarios scared me, but did so in a way that made me think, and it was exactly the type of book I was looking for.  More importantly, I believe I learned from it, because it was written in a way that allowed me to easily understand some complex subjects.<br />Although I am not as well versed in some of the subjects that the author obviously is, I found the subjects that I do have some knowledge about to have been very thoroughly researched.<br />If you're looking for a book that will keep you turning the pages, keep you entertained, and leave you with some added knowledge of subjects, such as Cyberterrorism and Bioengineering and natural catastrophes, such as Volcanic Eruptions and Tsunamis, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This CD is a true testament that great music may sometimes need the fewest of words. After a series of critical EPs, Sigur Ros brings to us this exceelent album Agaetis Byrjun. Like fellow Icelandic artist Bjork, Sigur Ros is visionary. Frequently, the songs are lush, dreamy and accompanied by haunting vocals.<br /><br />The almost 8-min track, Svefn g englar, is a prime example of a spellbinding number with haunting vocals that effectively numbs your mind with its spine-chilling effects.  Staralfur is a grand luschious piece that alterantes between full orchestration and simple guitar struts and reminds you of a dreamy landscape unfolding right in front. The rest of the album continues in a similar fashion but never sounds tired at any point but continues the lush and grand ambience.<br /><br />In essence, Sigur Ros creates a masterpiece that brings about an aural and mental assault.
0385503954|5.0|I have read and enjoyed several of McEwan's novels, but none surpasses &quot;Atonement.&quot;  It is wonderfully written, each sentence well crafted.  But McEwan is far more than just a good &quot;writer,&quot; he is a good storyteller, as well, which seems to be an increasingly diminishing capability with so many of today's authors.  From the initial moments of deceit at the beginning of the novel, to the incredible description of the horrors of war which comprise the middle of the book, to the resolution in the final pages, this is a beautiful page-turner.  To borrow an over-used saying, but one which is true in this particular case, McEwan is truly a writer at the top of his craft.
6305041156|4.0|This movie is a spectacular epic, adapting King Lear to the world of Japanese fuedal kingdoms. The battle scenes are breathtaking to behold and the adaptation is briliantly carried off by everyone involved. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars, in my mind, is the DVD. I would have appriciated some special features or commentary, but there is nothing added to the disc. That said, the movie is alone worth the price.
0060930349|5.0|I really enjoy reading this book. It connects all the textbook facts into themes while adding interesting little tidbits that keep your attention. While definitely not the final word on everything, I adamently recommend this book for supplementary reading.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John is a gifted guitar player who is coming into his own as a songwriter.  His songs touch universal points that everyone has gone through.  He is willing to show is vunerability, and that takes courage.  His live shows are even better...but in the words of JM &quot; they best of me is still hiding up my sleeve&quot;.  Look for a great follow-up to Room for Squares on Aware.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is good. Even, dare I say, great. The only problem is that Lennon, McCartney and Harrison sing all of the songs except 'Yellow Submarine'. They should have let Ringo sing on more.. even all of the songs. Just imagine that masterful voice ripping through 'And Your Bird Can Sing' or 'She Said She Said'. Or hearing his silky smooth crooning to 'Here There and Everywhere' or  'For No One'. Maybe one day McCartney and Yoko will open their eyes and record and release all the Beatles material sung by &quot;Golden Throat&quot; Starkey himself before he's not with us anymore either. Fingers crossed, fingers crossed.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I like it, I like it alot. It could have been better had the new recording of Cash's old standby &quot;Give my Love to Rose&quot; not been between Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; and Simon's &quot;Bridge over Troubled Waters.&quot; If Bridge had been directly after Hurt, then Bridge's message of hope and love and loyalty would have been even more powerful for being the reply to the despair of Hurt. Sam Hall and the Beatles' &quot;In My Life&quot; benefitted from being next to the other in the track list, with first a sentimental song and then a song of being an unrepentant rebel to the very end. Hurt and Bridge could also have benefitted from being next to the other, with Hurt first; but the songs themselves are great, no matter what the track order.
0783114222|5.0|This miniseries captures the excitement and tension of the project Apollo brilliantly. It does a great job of focusing on the technical achievements without forgetting about the humor and humanity of those involved. From the fun of Pete Conrad and Alan Bean to the sacrifice of the astronaut's wives, this series gives an accurate and in-depth perspective to this important period of American history. It's hard to recommend this enough.
B000003TA4|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst cd that i have ever heard and want my money back.  Every single song on the cd sounds the same.  The bass lines are flat, drumming repetitive, and kurt cobain has no talent as vocals.  If you want to listen to good grundge go buy some Stone Temple Pilots or Pearl Jam.  This CD wouldnt be near as popular had the idiot not committed suicide.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|Only a shadow of the original. Almost no new ideas. Flat uninteresting script. Dull dialogue.<BR>See it only if you are bored and have nothing else to do.<BR>The film was VERY formulaic and non-original. Especially the stupid talking dog gag. <BR>Major yawn.
B00006G8HX|2.0|I enjoy most of the Star Trek television shows, and some of the movies.  This movie was showing while I was on a flight from Japan to the US many years ago, and it was the first I'd seen it.<br />I normally can't sleep sitting up, but this movie did the trick for me.  Halfway through the film (probably during one of the dramatic scenes between Kirk and his estranged son) I drifted off, and arrived back home well rested thanks to Captain Kirk and company.<br />I recommend it to non-fanatics who are having trouble getting to sleep.
1559277254|3.0|I received Hard Eight, the unabridged audiobook version, as a present and approached it with a small amount of wariness because the last Janet Evanovich book I read on audio (that would be Seven Up) was ruined by the terrible over the top, cartoon-like rendering of the characters by narrator Tonya Elby.  Hard Eight is read by a woman named Lorelei who takes an extremely different approach to Stephanie.  Her approach, unfortunately, also does not work for me.  Am I too picky, or what?<br />Stephanie's voice as read in this version is way too cultured, way too slow and it doesn't sound at all like the Stephanie Plum we all know and love.  Here she sounds more like an out of place blue blooded socialite than a plucky Trenton, New Jersey girl.  Stephanie's words are too often over-enunciated and the Jersey accent is lost altogether.  And Ranger?!  Ugh, he almost sounds like Fez from \\"That 70's Show\\".  Is there no happy medium here folks?  I must say, though, that the other characters do come to life and the reader did a great job differentiating the characters from each other (unlike the actress who voiced Seven Up).  When a child speaks she sounds like a child.  When a criminal speaks he sounds like a criminal.  Not necessarily a criminal from New Jersey but I guess you just can't have it all.<br />Now about the story:<br />This time around Stephanie is on the search for a missing woman named Evelyn Soder and her young daughter Annie.  Evelyn's grandmother Mabel is a neighbor of the Plum family (this is how Stephanie gets wrapped up in the case).  Evelyn's ex-husband plans to cash in a \\"child custody bond\\" funded by Mabel.  Mabel fears she'll lose her home if Evelyn isn't found and she fears for her great-granddaughter because Evelyn isn't exactly a \\"stable\\" personality.<br />So, Stephanie, our fearless, bumbling bounty hunter and her friend Lula start sniffing around and before long they have a run in with Evelyn's landlord, an evil man named Eddie Abruzzi.  Abruzzi, who gives even street toughened Lula the creeps, is a nasty criminal who adds a much needed dark edge to this predictably frothy series.<br />Rounding out the cast of characters are the usual members that inhabit Stephanie's wild life.  Grandma Mazer is her normally wacky self, Stephanie's not-quite-so-perfect-anymore sister Valerie is still trying to find herself and newcomer Albert Kloughn (pronounced Clown, of course) joins the cast.  He's a goofy lawyer who badly wants to be Stephanie's assistant and begins to follow her around like a lost puppy dog.  Accident prone yet immensely lovable, Kloughn provides a few of the (far too few) comical moments in the story.  The usual run-ins with Ranger and Joe are here but I have to admit this love triangle stuff is getting awfully stale.  Stephanie's still torn between the two sexy men and flip-flops between them.  I wish they'd just hash it out and put an end to this tired \\"who will she pick?\\" drama.  Enough already!<br />This story was my least favorite of the Plum books.  It's not bad by any means and still entertains with its fast pace and moments of wit and I enjoyed the dark edge but the laugh out moments are too few and far between and everything has become too predictable.  Stephanie is stuck in a rut and hasn't grown a bit since Book One.  She keeps repeating the same mistakes that were funny, oh say three books ago?  She forgets her gun, she bumbles her FTA's, she has intense sexual tension with Ranger and Joe, her cars are blown up at an alarming rate, and she eats horrifically bad food but still manages to squeeze into her jeans.  It's all too familiar at this point but, yeah, I'll still buy the next book because even mediocre Stephanie Plum is better than no Stephanie Plum.<br />~ Laurie Shallahwho gives even street toughened Lula the creeps, is a nasty criminal who adds a much needed dark edge to this predictably frothy series.<br />Rounding out the cast of characters are the usual members that inhabit Stephanie's wild life.

B00003CXXM|4.0|The Director of Go puts together another delightful web of intrigue and suspense in this character driven spy thriller. Although the plot varies greatly from the book, the storyline does not disappoint. <br />Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, assassin sans-memory. Franka Potente is the gypsy girl starving for a man who offers security. Chris Cooper plays the CIA Black Ops Director Hunting the two seemingly star-crossed lovers down. <br />The Movie is brimming with edge of your seat action sequences that will keep you tranfixed to the screen. Spy Movie Lovers Enjoy. A new hero has been Bourne.
B00005MP58|3.0|I was studying abroad in England when this miniseries first aired on the BBC on Sunday nights.  I completely fell in love with it.  It was broadcast in England in widescreen so even after buying the full-screen VHS version I wanted to get the Special Edition DVD so I could relive my original experience.  Alas, the DVD quality is very poor.  As others have written, the colors look washed out and faded.   With DVDs you pay for better quality picture and sound, not worse!<br />If you are buying your very first copy of this miniseries, go with the VHS version until the DVD has been improved.
0060273224|5.0|Garth builds an interesting world filled with the dead come back to haunt and eat the living. Sabriel must deal with these things and restore order to the Kingdom. It's a great read, no hooky tricks with last minute savings from things not mentioned prior. It's both a coming of age book, and an journey book. Recomended for young teens and adults. May be too scary for pre-teens.
0553801511|4.0|This was an interesting read and very different from Fool's Errand.  Unlike 'Errand, this story is actually many small stories that take place during the winter court following the events in the earlier book.  Each story is woven within the others and tied together seamlessly with brilliant segue's.  Hobb uses her ability to paint vivid characterizations to pace the book and keep us turning the pages.  As the various plot lines appear, present their difficulties, and get solved (well, most of them anyway) we get to see the central characters become more finely honed.  Fitz needed this to rebuild after his loss in 'Errand.  The other characters needed this because of the roles they will be playing in the third book.  This is Fitz's 'rebuilding' book and the pleasure I had in following Fitz through this tough time was very worthwhile.  While Fitz is busy rebuilding we get an inkling of the nature of his next adventure which promises to be active and rife with conflict that will not only test Fitz's abilities against his foes but his friends as well.  I highly recommend this book, but will say no more lest I spoil the experience.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is truly a book worth remembering.  The story is a heart-wrenching tale of teenage love and trial.  The story helps us as readers to remember what it was like being a teenager in love, whether that was only a couple of years ago or centuries ago. It gives us a glimpse into the workings of the teenage mind and it helps us to learn how to deal with hard things in life.

0375414932|4.0|Life, as understood by Logan Mountstuart, is a series of random events, not events which are fated, controlled by a higher power, or the result of carefully made decisions.  There's nothing and no one to blame for whatever good or bad luck we may have in life.  A person may choose to enjoy the good times, seek out happiness wherever possible, and live life to the fullest or sit back passively and just endure whatever happens.  Logan Mountstuart is one of the former types, a man who recognizes that \\"Every life is both ordinary and extraordinary--it is the respective proportions of those categories that make life appear interesting.\\" But Mountstuart also believes that one can look for and find the extraordinary within the ordinary.<br /><br />Through his personal journals, begun in 1923, when he is seventeen, and continuing to the time of his death in 1991, we come to know Mountstuart intimately, both as an individual, growing and changing, and as an Everyman, someone who participates in and is affected by the seminal events of the 20th century, after World War I.  Because he is a writer, he is able to travel and to know other writers and artists of the period.  When he meets Aldous Huxley, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, Cyril Connolly, Evelyn Waugh, and Ian Fleming, the reader has the vicarious fun of being there and meeting them, too, since Mountstuart, as a person, appears to be very much like the rest of us.  He buys early paintings by Paul Klee and Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso draws a quick portrait of him and signs it.  He engages in intellectual discussions about Braque, Picasso, James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Bloomsbury group and keeps the reader aware of literary and artistic achievements of the era.<br /><br />It is in his depiction of the historical moment that Boyd shines.  By describing events through Mountstuart's experience, he is able to give a human face to people and circumstances which have influenced our history, and his choice of small details, often unique, offers a new slant on some familiar events.  Boyd is particularly good at showing simultaneous events--Franco at the gates of Barcelona while Hitler is entering Prague--and his explanation of Neville Chamberlain's giving up of the Sudetenland resonates as an honest and even logical attempt to avoid the desperation of war.  When Ian Fleming, who works for the Secret Service, gets Mountstuart a job in Naval Intelligence, the reader is introduced to the colorful world of the Duke of Windsor, as Mountstuart \\"spies\\" on him to make sure that the Duke's German sympathies do not make him a pawn of the enemy.  Post-war, Mountstuart continues to be involved with the world of artists and writers--and world events--eventually living in Nigeria before retiring to France.<br /><br />For the reader the book is a fast read, despite its length, filled with personal stories and colored by world events.  Mountstuart's belief that life is just the aggregate of one's good luck and bad luck--that things simply happen--leads, of necessity, to a story which is not organized by a hidden, underlying theme.  Befitting its philosophy, it is episodic and random, using the passage of time as its primary framework.  Mountstuart himself accepts what happens to him, though it often saddens him, and does not agonize over what he might have done differently--he does not believe that he could have changed things.  In that regard he remains one-dimensional, in many ways an Everyman for the history of the times.  Fun to read, the book offers a new \\"take\\" on events which have shaped our own times, offering no lessons for the future, other than to live life, despite its ups and downs.  As Mountstuart himself points out, life ultimately is a yo-yo, \\"a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child.\\" Mary Whipplen unique, offers a new slant on some familiar events.

B00006LLNU|5.0|the music is beautiful, the &quot;words&quot; are endearing... it's just a fantastic album, what more can i say.
B000063DIR|1.0|I no longer have any respect for Ozzy & Sharon. I bought this album thinking I was getting the original & then found out after I opened it, that Bob Daisley & Lee Kerslake's parts have been wiped right off the album and replaced with new parts by current Ozzy band members. And it doesn't even state that on the front cover (I blame the greedy record company as well, for going along with this). And all because Ozzy doesn't want to pay royalties that he owes to these guys. If Randy Rhodes' estate made demands that Ozzy & Sharon didn't want to pay, would they rerelease these again with his guitar parts wiped off as well? And if Bob Daisley wrote most or all of the lyrics, shouldn't Ozzy have removed those too & just rewritten all the lyrics, plus whatever musical parts Daisley wrote? I mean, just come out with \\"Diary of a Madman\\" but with all new musicians, music & lyrics!! This is a travesty. It would have been better if he had just come out with a brand new recording of this album & \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" (he did the same with that album) - as long as the original was still available. Anyhow, Sharon talks about turning a \\"negative into a positive\\" but for who?? Only them obviously...not Daisley or Kerslake & certainly not the fans who can no longer have an album that they have loved for 20 years the way it is supposed to sound. Now I have to go to the store & lie in order to try to get my money back. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM & \\"BLIZZARD OF OZZ!!!\\" (From what I have read, Ozzy didn't do this with later albums, even though Bob Daisley played on them - what sense does that make?).
B00006CXSS|5.0|Rather than tell you a summary of this series and give you the inside info, I am just going to say if you haven't bought this seies GET UP AND BUY IT! Because it is quite possibly the greatest work of film ever made!
B000001Y5D|4.0|combining musical styles that range from blues to rock and powered by linda perry's great voice, 4 non blondes blasted out with a bang.  i do not think their song whats up, which was released to radio, does them justice.  it is not an honest representation of all they are.  the music is great and spans many styles.  the song drifitng is probably their most powerful and it is a shame they never went anywhere.  i do know linda has ended up behind the scenes doing writing and producing for artits such as pink and christina aguilarea but where are the others?  linda had some solo albums but they are hard to get, i am discovering.  <BR>     this album, to me, still stands up and still sounds good.  in fact it is one of those albums that sound better each time you listen to it and so i think it is a worthwhile investment.
B00001OH7G|5.0|I feel that this is Rory's best performance!! Live music,long songs, hard rockin', it's just what I like. \\"Cradle Rock\\", \\"Walk on Hot Coals\\" and \\"Back on My Stompin' Ground\\"(a slide guitar tune) are to be played very loud:). They rock so hard. \\"I Wonder Who\\" has a nice blues touch. \\"As the Crow Flies\\" and \\"A Million Miles Away\\" reveal Rory's softer side. \\"Too Much Alcohol\\" adds a little bit of humor.   I can't believe no one in the US knows who this guy is anymore.
0792835050|5.0|This saga of a German WWII spy is absolutely fantastic. Donald Sutherland turns in a wonderful performance as Faber ( a great performance is not always given by Sutherland).<br />The use of the stiletto to enforce Faber's secrets is truly an inspired touch by the director.<br />This movie is tragic, yet cunningly directed and acted. All of this while starring relative unknowns (excepting Sutherland). <br />This is definitely the best spy movie of all time.
B0000048V8|5.0|Not your usual children's video, THE SNOWMAN will transport you to a magical fantasy world with nothing but moving music and gentle images of this little boy and his wonderful snowy friend.  No dialog is needed here, you simply sit back and let yourself relax and enjoy the experience.  First time I showed this film to my classroom of four year olds they were fixated to the screen and I was amazed at how much emotion the story evoked in me.  I bought the film for my own nieces and they watch it over and over, not just at holiday time.  It has now become a classic in our own children's video library.  A must have for the entire family.
B00003CXE6|5.0|I love Russell Crowe so this was immediately a must see for me. I must say that this was one of his best preformances in my mind.<br />With the use of use of superb computer graphics, as well as exceptional costume work, the viewer is transported back to ancient Rome and into the arena. The film is full of action, political intrigue, and also deals with issues of love and faith.  The cast is strong, the dialogs perfectally written, and the viewer is treated to the perfect amount of gore.  You will feel you are really there without being overwhelmed by blood and guts that weren't really needed in order to get the point across.<br />This film is truly a work of art, and it is obvious that it aimed to please.

Attivus is assigned drags the whole family into a roller coaster with drops that come unexcpected.  At times this nobel was a thriller, prickling up and down your spine with danger lerking around every corner.  Other times this book had a sweet romance that is adorably cute because of the age of the destined lovers.  There is also taumma.

Absolutly!  Positivly!  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
B00006DEF9|5.0|One of the best movie musicals made. Classic dance scenes with all three actors, but especially with the genius of Kelly and O'Connor. O'Conner's dance in &quot;Make'um Laugh&quot; is hysterical and manic. Kelly and O'Connor's &quot;speech class&quot; dance is amazing if you watch it on slo-mo. The footwork is beyond anything I've seen anywhere except maybe Fred Astaire. They make it look so effortless! Debbie Reynolds keeps up with the boys so well, she blends right in with sheer talent. And one can't forget the title dance of &quot;Singing&quot; with Kelly. I always forget whatever troubles I have watching it. It's so optimistic and joyful! I've watched this film over and over for the atmosphere, the dancing, and the music. Vintage 20s/30s and disney all wrapped up in one show. Fabulous and Fun!
B00006RU5B|5.0|It starts off with 'Cochise', a good hit with a sweet guitar. Then the CD moves onto other good songs like 'Gasoline' and 'Like a Stone'. After 'Like a Stone' the CD gets a bit softer, but it is still extremely good. 'Shadow on the Sun' is a very good track that I'm pretty sure anyone would enjoy, it's just beautiful. The power and Rage Against the Machine mixed with the voice of Soundgarden was a very good idea.
B00003CXTF|5.0|The re-creation of the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself, may be very close to what was actually witnessed, and it was masterfully presented, but this and about two or three other scenes in the movie that account for approximately half of the film, are the only historical depictions of Pearl Horbor.  The rest of the story tells a very moving love story.<br />DOn't get me worng.  The love story is actually a very important part of the film.  After all, soldiers and families who were present at Pearl Harbor did have any number of love stories.  The love story adds the personal aspect of Pearl Harbor, not to mention making the sotry a tear jerker and an emotional rollar coaster ride.  <br />I loved this film, and would recommend it to all, but do keep in mind that it isn't your traditional war movie.
B000002KIE|3.0|Contrary to what many say, the Sex Pistols were not the originators of punk. In the U.S. The Ramones beat them to the punch by a year or so, and in the U.K. The Damned released their first album a few months before Nevermind The Bollocks.. came out in '77 (what a year!). Of course, then you had The New York Dolls, The Stooges, and The MC5 who all came before them.<br /><br />Still, this was a very important recording, for if nothing else it revealed punk's scathing anger to the world, a world in which radio was dominated by the likes of KISS and Journey. Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious got all the press and attention for their controversial antics, and their manufactured image as nihilistic punk rockers. The band only lasted one album under Malcolm McLaren's supervision before self-destructing in a grand fashion. Before the album was recorded, competent bassist Glen Matlock was already fired from the band. His crime? Liking The Beatles! Sid Vicious filled the void, but he couldn't play worth a damn, so Steve Jones did all the basslines and guitarwork for the album. Johnny Rotten was a lousy singer from a technical standpoint--in other words, he was perfect, and his voice was one that dripped rage, disaffection, and sarcasm.<br /><br />The music is probably what you would expect from all this--tattered, forceful, confrontational, and somewhat inconsistent.  There are two great, controversial anthems that spit on the British establishment, God Save The Queen and Anarchy In The U.K.; pisstakes at record labels (E.M.I.) and The New York Dolls (New York, which Johnny Thunders promptly shot back at with his song \\"London Boys\\"); a somewhat over-the-top anti-abortion track (Bodies); and downright excellent and hilarious expressions of defiant nihilism (Pretty Vacant, No Feelings and Holidays In The Sun). The rest? Well, to be honest, not all that great.<br /><br />While The Clash's first album, The Stiff Little Fingers' Inflammable Material, The Ramones' first three records, and The Damned's Damned Damned Damned are all more consistent and more musical than Nevermind The Bollocks.., it would be foolhardy to dismiss the Sex Pistols' impact on rock 'n' roll (even if they weren't the first punk outfit). Buy this record along with the above albums if you want an education on punk's legacy.Damned Damned Damned are all more consistent and more musical than Nevermind The Bollocks.., it would be foolhardy to dismiss the Sex Pistols' impact on rock 'n' roll (even if they weren't the first punk outfit).

0792151712|5.0|What a tear jerker.  I spent the whole second half of the film in tears.  I own this film, but over the years have still not been able to get up the nerve to watch it again.  Don't get me wrong, it was spectacular, but an emotional roller coaster.  Not a ride I could take too often.

I bought Joshua Tree sometime ago but never really bought anything else until Achtung Baby a year or so later...now after picking up these classic masterpieces I decided to go for Pop.

Pop rocks.. its not pop.. its sweet rock.
0451191153|3.0|Funny how most of the reviews are either unqualified adulation from Rand worshipers or slams from Rand haters. IMO, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is neither a prophetic work of great genius nor a piece of evil tripe. It is a brilliant work, perhaps even with flashes of genius -- but as flawed as its author.<br />I think Rand had the potential to be a great novelist, which she largely ruined when she decided she was the world's greatest philosopher since Aristotle. Any dogma is the enemy of art. If you read Rand's three major novels -- \\"We the Living\\", \\"The Fountainhead\\", and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" -- you can see her dogma becoming more and more rigid, and her characters less and less human. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a novel you can still appreciate even if you don't agree with the philosophy (and I think the philosophy has some excellent points, just taken to an absurd extreme).<br /><br />[SPOILERS FOLLOW BELOW<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />CONTINUE<br /><br />AT<br /><br />YOUR<br /><br />OWN<br /><br />RISK]<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers here, I don't find Howard Roark to be completely inhuman. He does feel pain -- not only the pain of his own struggle but of his mentor Henry Cameron and his friend Steve Mallory, the sculptor. It's just that, as Rand says, the pain \\"only goes down to a certain point\\" because it can't touch the core of his independent soul. But consider this passage when Dominique tells Roark she has married Peter Keating: \\"It would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound, closing his fists and twisting them in defense against himself. But it was not easy, because she did not see him doing this, yet knew that this was being done, without the relief of a physical gesture.\\" Clearly this is a man who feels and suffers. He can feel sympathy as well: for Gail Wynand, even for Peter Keating.<br />At that stage, Rand herself was still capable of sympathy for less-than-perfect characters. GuyFrancon, Dominique's father, is an opportunist -- but ultimately still more a good than a bad guy. His relationship with his daughter, sparsely depicted, is nonetheless very \\"real\\" and touching. Even Keating, the ultimate \\"second-hander\\" and in many ways a despicable man, is to some extent sympathetic and is shown as having some good in him. His failed romance with his true love, Katie, is very poignant -- and the scene near the end where he meets her years after dumping her, when she has \\"gotten over\\" him and lost her humanity, is truly heartbreaking. (Though her loss of humanity and selfhood is a little too complete.)<br />Gail Wynand is a fascinating, tragic character throughout -- and in a way, his relationship with Dominique is more interesting than the Howard/Dominique romance. The story of his childhood and his rise in the newspaper industry is absorbing and very well-written.<br />Some reviewers mention stilted dialogue. I don't agree. Yes, there are long passages where the characters preach/philosophize instead of talking, and become nothing but vehicles for Rand's ideas. But apart from that, the dialogue is mostly dynamic, crisp, and quite believable (e.g. the first meeting between Wynand and Dominique).<br />Rand also has a terrific descriptive style. Take this passage describing the aftermath of rain: \\"The pavements glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from the sky, it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were yellow puddles of light in the windows.\\"<br />And there are wonderful, memorable lines; one of my favorites is, \\"All love is exception-making.\\"<br />Now the flaws. The character of Dominique, particularly in the first half of the book, is not very plausible. I don't \\"get\\" her masochism, the wallowing in her degradation at Roark's hands in their first encounter. (And yes, it was definitely rape -- Dominique herself repeatedly describes it as such.) Her motives for trying to destroy Roark's career when she has already realized she loves him never feel \\"real,\\" no matter how Rand tries to rationalize them. I enjoy twisted love-hate relationships as much as the next gal (one of my favorite books is \\"Wuthering Heights\\") but this is twisted beyond plausibility. (Dominique becomes much more believable in the second half of the book, though; the scene where she finally comes back to Roark is great.)<br />Ellsworth Toohey with his grandiose plans for world power is even more implausible. And the idea that the dumbing down of culture is some sort of deliberate plot to pass off mediocre works as great ones in order to debase cultural standards ... puh-leeze.<br />Rand has an annoying tendency to restate every idea a dozen times and hammer the reader over the head with it.  Eventually you just want to shout, \\"All right, Ayn -- I got the point!\\"<br />As for the philosophy -- yes, the occasional super-individualist like Howard Roark is great. A lot of great geniuses, including apparently Leonardo da Vinci, didn't have the \\"people\\" gene. But if everyone behaved like that ... I'm not sure it would be such a great world to live in. No matter how much Rand might pretend otherwise, her worship of the great man does have a flip side of contempt for the mass of humanity. See Wynand's comment to Dominique, \\"One can't love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name.\\" That's scary. So is Rand's palpable disgust for the imperfections of unheroic human (and particularly female) flesh.<br />A readable, thought-provoking book, but hardly a guide to life.  Read it -- but with a critical mind.

0380789035|3.0|This novel was an odd thing for me to get through.  For a few pages, the book would have me in its claws.  After that, however, something would shake me out of my trance and I would struggle to regain my enthusiasm for a chapter or so.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly why this book fell short for me.  The characters were entertaining and the story moved at a decent pace.  One thing I noticed that Gaiman does in this book is he describes someone getting shot in the face with the same intensity as he would someone sitting in a cafe with their legs crossed, sipping a cup of stale coffee.  While the words are undoubtedly well chosen, the mood is somehow stifled.  No exclamation points, no terse wording to suggest the rapidity and urgency of the situation.  Maybe that's what held me back a bit.<br />  Overall, American Gods proves to be a good read.  I hate using the word 'good', but it's the only worthy word that comes to mind.
0790729628|1.0|As others here have said, why just the director's cut? Where is the original with the voice over? I like them both, but prefer the voice over version. Why hasn't the original with voice over come out on DVD? Why not put both versions on this one? For that reason alone this DVD gets 1 star. Which is sad, because this is definitely a 4 or 5 star movie.
B0000029GA|5.0|There is really only one way to describe Nas' first and greatest album, Illmatic: a rap masterpiece.  Never has another rapper been able to top the unbelievable creativity and overall greatness of this album.  Since I first discovered Illmatic, I haven't gone one day without listening to atleast one track from the cd.  It's hard to believe that a 20 year old kid from Queens could make such a brilliant album.  Nas will never be able to recreate the reality and truth that is behind the greatness of Illmatic.  This album paints a dark, yet hopeful picture for it's listeners about the life of a young black man in the projects of Queens, NY.  Through it, we are shown the daily life, hopes, and dreams of the young Nas, one of the most skillful and poetic rappers of our time.

B0000646UN|3.0|Winter War is a great movie, but a horrible DVD.<br />The picture quality STINKS, and there are NO EXTRAS.<BR>It is impossible to turn the sub-titles off either.<br />However, from a military perspective, the movie ROCKS!!<BR>There is battle scene after battle scene, with all of it re-inacted with tremendous realism. Watching the combat take place in the cold Finnish landscape, you will feel transported in time to the Winter of 1939-40. You will know what the experience was of a Finn soldier fighting against the Soviet horde.<br />I am planning on buying and reading the non-fictional book, Talvisota, because the movie does not give much of a strategic view of the 120 day war. The movie is dedicated to the tactical side of the fighting, because that is what the typical Finn solider did (example - &quot;this is your trench, there is the enemy, NONE SHALL PASS!&quot;) For overall descriptions of troop movements, and the reasons why the Soviet Army was turned away in stalemate at the end of the conflict, one needs to read a pure historical account.<br />PS If any small country in the World needs inspiration to fight off the military aggressions of a big bully, then this story is it!
B000002JB8|5.0|Great, relaxing music! I've listened to it over and over. Very nice melodies that gently take you away...
0312265859|3.0|I've read the entire Stephanie Plum series, and frankly Hard Eight was somewhat of a letdown.  In the previous books of the series, there were scenes where I laughed out loud - several times.  This one barely got a snicker out of me.  I read these books for what they are - a 'light' venture into the life of inept bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, her quirky family and associates, her love life, yet with a touch of mystery thrown in.  It's not heavy reading for sure.<br />But I found a couple of indescrepancies in this book that made me feel the author was not paying attention to detail any longer, and was probably rushed to meet her deadline.  For example - Hard Eight appears to start up about 2 months after Seven Up ended.  In Hard Eight, Ranger once again has his hair back in the ponytail, however it was noted in Seven Up a few times that he had cut his hair extremely short as a disguise.  Does hair grow that fast?  And no further mention of Stephanie's new platinum blonde (a la Marilyn) hair .  That should have at least merited a mention once her roots started growing out!  And Stephanie's bathroom was still mentioned as being that awful \\"orange and brown\\", but we all knew her apartment had undergone a complete re-do after the fire in a previous book.  Little things, yes, but with Ms. Evanovich having such a large group of loyal \\"Stephanie followers\\", this lack of attention to detail is quite annoying to those of us immersed in Stephanie's life.  And these hardbound books are not cheap. Are double-spaced to boot, and can be read in one sitting.  I'd like a little more for my money these days.<br />I read on Ms. Evanovich's website that her contract is good through Book #11 - let's hope that in these last 3 of the series provide some more \\"meat\\" like One for the Money - the original book that garnered so many rave reviews, and got so many of us hooked on Stephanie Plum.  I could see this series continuing past #11, IF the author makes some changes in Stephanie's life(after all, she is a few years older than when she started this adventure) - maybe she could go along to capture an FTA with Ranger in the Bahamas or something, steaming up the pages a little as Ranger does \\"his thing\\" - free of interfering grandmas, the long-suffering, sometimes boyfriend Joe Morelli, and Stephanie's many \\"drop ins\\".  Or maybe she goes on a vacation to \\"get away from it all\\" and ends up having a madcap adventure anyway.  I don't know - something to broaden her horizons a little.  If not, then I hope the author gives Stephanie a happy forever by Book #11.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Wow, this is a shock, this one is actually better than the first! Fully aware of its status as the sequel to the surprise hit thriller of 1996, this lively follow-up trades freshness for familiarity, playing on our affection for returning characters while obeying--and then subverting--the &quot;rules&quot; of sequels. Once again, movie references are cleverly employed to draw us into the story, which takes place two years after the events of Scream, at a small Ohio college, where the Scream survivors reunite when another series of mysterious killings begins. Scream 2 does a lot better job in hiding the killer, and has a few good jolts, and has what the first film didn't have...SUSPENSE! I now have respect for this movie series, and I will see the third one. This one has a great story, great acting, and a smart killer, all of wich the first one didn't have, so see the first one then see the next one, wich is even better!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is absolutely phenominal. I am 22 and normally listen to more hip-hop and rap music than anything... until recently I began working at a music store and we couldn't keep this album in stock b/c is was selling so fast. I had to see what all the hype was about. So I bought it and took it home not knowing what I was getting myself into. And to be truly honest with you, I have absolutely no regrets - I bought two more copies for some family members for Christmas, and they love it too. Every single song tells a new story in such a catchy way. Whether you wanna light some candles and run a bubble bath or just cruise around in your car with the top open, this is the album to buy. Her voice is strong & her tone is perfect. If this hip-hop rappin' girl can go Easy Listening/Jazz, so can you!
0743424425|5.0|How is it that a book for which I've seen the movie at least a dozen times can still frighten you?<br />Stephen King, that's how!<br />I read this at the gym, and holy cow, I swear to you I'd get the chills.  Don't feel that you've seen the movie, now I don't need to read the book.  Read the book!!! It's a completely different story.  And it is awesome!!!

B00005JKQZ|4.0|The story of a genius mathmatician at his onset of schizophrenia.  At the time Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia it was thought that only insulin shock, medicine, and a stress-free life could allow him to function with the schizophrenia.  The medical treatments cost him his ability to solve mathmatical equations and ability to function.  As a man of logic he decided to take the disorder into his own hands.  Since Nash had always had a gift for solving irrational problems why couldn't he solve this one?  I am sure that what Hollywood has given us in this film is far from the truth of what really happened with John Nash, but it was a nice story.  The movie is charged with great actors.  Plus some of the deleted scenes are actually worth watching, a rare find.
044651652X|1.0|If I had to guess, Robert James Walker wrote this book as the settlement of a bet. I imagine that during a party or a drinking binge, a friend insisted that no one could pass off a pulp romance novel as literary fiction, and Walker took up the challenge. If my hunch is right, then clearly Walker has won that bet, because \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" could easily keep Danielle Steele's novels company on the bookshelf.<BR>Walker's main characters (in fact, all of the characters) are caricatures, easily painted in a few broad strokes of descriptive cliches that immediately tell us what type of character we're seeing. We have Robert Kincaid (a melding of Walker's own first name with the kind of last name only given to lean, muscular men with chiseled faces and strong chins), a photographer and world traveler who has the kind of broad experience in life and exotic cultures that instantly make him fascinating to any woman. The \\"any woman\\" is Francesca, who is trapped in a loveless, joyless, dull marriage without any sexual excitement whatsoever. The only difference between these two and the pair painted on the cover of a Harlequin romance is their age - Robert and Francesca are middle aged, approaching their golden years. <BR>Walker employs many of the cliches of the romance novel in his style as well, including ridiculously simplistic internal monologues, one word sentences, and the vocabulary of an eight-year old with just enough big words thrown in to make the whole thing sound like a poor high-school student's term paper.<BR>A waste of time to read. I understand, however, that the movie is a major improvement over the book, which doesn't surprise me.
B000002TQV|5.0|OK.  I've listened to just about everything this Oxford quintet has to offer (except \\"Pablo Honey\\"...sorry folks!).  Maybe I'm a square or something, but \\"The Bends\\" certainly contains Radiohead's best--and least experimental--music.  No doubt about it.<br />This CD is the only Radiohead album that is consistently strong from start to finish.  Songs like \\"High and Dry\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Bullet Proof...I Wish I Was\\" and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" are stunning in their virtuosity and beauty.  \\"Just\\" is a really catchy tune that sounds upbeat--if you ignore the lyrics.  The title track and \\"Bones\\" are the closest thing to head-bangers that you'll get from RH, and \\"My Iron Lung\\" is experimental without the pretentiousness that has sandbagged some of their later efforts.<br />To put things in perspective, the much ballyhooed \\"OK Computer\\" has stronger individual songs than \\"The Bends\\", but it sputters to a close for much of its second half.  I admire \\"Kid A\\" for RH's daring electronic experimentation and their unwillingness to make \\"OK Computer, Part 2\\".  Some of its songs are great, but overall \\"Kid A\\" lacks heart and it left me a little cold.  While \\"Amnesiac\\" has some jaw-dropping moments (e.g. \\"The Pyramid Song\\"), it's perhaps RH's most inconsistent album.  However, \\"The Bends\\" is strong from start to finish and it doesn't let up.<br />Ergo, I would recommend \\"The Bends\\" as the best place to start for the casual Radiohead listener, then proceed to the other CDs if you really like these guys.<br />Two final things before I go:<br />1.  Why can't Radiohead make a decent-looking album cover?  I don't know who designs their stuff, but they really need to hire a new crew or something.  \\"Kid A\\" was their best album cover, but it looks like a high school art student's interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's Misty Mountains.  I know there are some great artists out there, and these guys need to hire one quick!<br />2.  I hope that Radiohead's next album has some songs thathave SOME humor in them!  I know that RH often get compared to Pink Floyd, but they don't have to copy the Floyd's oppressive cheerlessness.  Even a band as angry as The Clash had some funny moments (e.g. \\"The Right Profile\\").  Once again, perhaps I'm a total square, but I hope that Thom Yorke (who has the best voice in rock music today) can one day flash those grey, crooked British teeth of his in a smile every once in a while.
0375414053|4.0|I am surprised by the number of readers who have given this book negative reviews on this forum! I can only guess that this is due to a need to \\"vent\\" after reading it, if one is offended or bored by Kate's constant criticism of herself, her chauvinistic, workaholic co-workers, and the \\"Muffia\\" of stay-home \\"mums\\" whom she simultaneously despises and envies.  I found this book hilarious, sad, realistic, and unrealistic all at the same time, in different places.  As a mother who has worked mainly part-time, I could definitely relate to Kate; to the Muffia; and even to Richard, Kate's somewhat lazy but patient and loyal husband.  Mums, regardless of your work/stay-home status, if you have ever experienced the horrible, guilty, \\"torn in half\\" feelings associated with daily separation from your young children, or if you have ever stayed up all night with a sick child or been horribly sleep-deprived, then you may like this book as much as I did.  Then again, you may not.  (It also helps if you have a healthy understanding of British humour.)
0195067142|5.0|To say that this book is powerful is inadequate.  235 men of Company K, 3d Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division went ashore at Peleliu in September of 1944.  In June of 1945, after mopping up at Okinawa, only 26 of the original K/3/5 made it through.  Note E. B. Sledge's integrity as an objective observer of war.  Sledge, known as \\"Sledgehammer\\" by the raggedy-... Marines, tells his horrific story without whining or self-pity.  Neither is he grinding an anti-war, \\"peace at any price\\" ax.  His experience is of the face of battle reduced to its most sickening level.  Never mind the position movements on maps at headquarters; the stench of battle prevails.  From Sledge's viewpoint, grand strategy gave way to one-on-one enemy action in his sector.  Fear and survival exclude swagger.  Men in battle persevere to kill the enemy and to support their buddies.  Naive expectations fade quickly as maggots infest the dead and torrential jungle rain fills the foxholes.  Bloody Nose Ridge and the Shuri Line grind the Marines.  The snap of bullets, the whine of artillery shells, and the agonized cries of wounded comrades are the only soundtrack.  Mental and emotional fatigue takes a fearful toll, right along with bloody wounds and dreadful field sanitation.  Sledge deplores the brutish nature of war, but recognizes its occasional inevitability, humanity's great dilemma.  The privilege of freedom carries its own responsibilities.  Heed the writing of a fighting man who knows.  This book should be required reading for all persons on both sides of the war controversy.  ;-)

B00005K9LM|5.0|Fortunitely I got the origional version of this album, cause I knew that the bonus track sounded as weak as \\"Last Rose of Summer\\" from Sin After Sin. So this album gets up to 39:00, and it actualy has 9 songs, not 10(\\"heavy duty\\" and \\"defenders of the faith\\" are attached songs on 2 of the last tracks). Their is no track you'd wanna skip here, but \\"night comes down\\" is the least good. This album is also great because I put it on every time I wanna take a nap, and it really helps me fall a sleep(like I said, I don't have to skip anything here).<BR>Next up; the first experimental album, first to sound so 80's, and what is known to be their lightest album: Turbo, which includes love contents and pozing off about metal(did I mention \\"rock n' roll\\"? God I hate when they say that). They do the same thing on Ram It Down, but the only difference is that it sounds more like Painkiller.<BR>Good luck on finding the origional version of DoF. You'll need it.
B00005JLRR|2.0|They did it again... the \\"Star Trek\\" powers-that-be have assailed us with yet another meager effort. How inexcusable is it that after a four-year big screen hiatus that Trek returns with another exercise in mediocrity? Isn't it bad enough that the once-vibrant television franchise has been destroyed with an inferior spin-off (\\"Enterprise\\")? With this tenth movie effort, long-time TNG fans were finally given another chance at an epic moviegoing experience. Instead, they got laughable dialogue, boring villains who existed only to generate space combat, a mind-numbing first hour, and a jeep chase, for God's sake. Are the writers/creators really that sophomoric? This is \\"Star Trek,\\" after all. Forgive me if you disagree, but a jeep chase hardly seems fit for inclusion in this once high-brow franchise. <br />Come to think of it, that's the entire problem with the current state of Trek. The writing used to be top-notch, the characters used to be provocative, and the voyages used to be inspiring. They ceased to be that in May of 2001 when \\"Voyager\\" ended. \\"The Next Generation\\" used to excite our imaginations every week with inventive and sophisticated plotlines, engaging characters and a great sense of adventure. Sadly, \\"Nemesis\\" had none of that. Our beloved characters were given laughable dialogue, everyone except Picard and Data were window-dressing, the villains were cliche, and the hackneyed plot was a tired retread of your average outdated action movie.  <br />Speaking of action, some people give far too much credit to this movie simply on the basis of the space battle in the second half. Sure, phasers and photons are nice, but can they really make up for the first half of the movie? And try as you may, you'll never convince me that the first half was even mildly interesting. Considering that this movie was touted to be the final one featuring the TNG crew (and most likely will be due to its poor showing at the box office), I really can't imagine a more lackluster conclusion to a once-great legacy. For those of you who thought \\"Generations\\" and \\"Insurrection\\" were bad, here's another piece of average Hollywood tripe derived from a television series that was anything but average. But then again, all good things must come to an end...

B00004Z459|2.0|I am not a jaded Megadeth/Hatebreed fan who had a few hours to spare and decided to go around strutting my 'superiority' and bashing all music that I personally dislike. I've owned Linkin Park's Hybrid theory for two years now, and have spent that much time crafting an appropriate review.<br />No disrespect to Megadeth(R.I.P), or Hatebreed, or Linkin Park, for that matter. They're all bands playing(or that have played) music for the sake of playing music, and made their own contributions to the scenes and styles they each belong to, respectively.<br />&quot;One Step Closer&quot; is an aggressive track, with loads of melody and some pretty cool turntabling, all packed into an explosive 2 and 1/2 minute song. &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; all show the band's willingness to flirt with hip-hop and techno, with catchy choruses and 'rapping' abound. &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;By Myself&quot; are other aggressive tracks, with more screams and harsh guitars, but plenty of catchiness. In fact, aside from &quot;Cure For The Itch,&quot; all of the songs have some form of hook or catchy riff/chorus to reel in a listener. Here's the problem: It gets old. Fast. It honestly does. I listened to the CD for two months tops before giving it to my 9-year old brother, who got tired of it as well. He listens to P.O.D. and Blind Guardian. Hybrid theory sits in our house forgotten. <br />The riffs that are so catchy are nothing but formulaic power-chords, and the 'rapping' is amateurish at best. Mike Shinoda does a better job on Reanimation and Built From Scratch. Perhaps he was simply inexperienced at the time of Hybrid Theory's recording. It definitely shows. Chester Bennington has wonderful melody, but screams like a little girl way too much, and his melodic singing voice is VERY pop-sounding. Sometimes he sounds like a 7-year old boy after being kicked in the crotch, and other times like a Justin Timberlake incarnate. Disturbing combination.The DJ is good, but unnecessary, and the drummer can never be heard over the programmed drums and turntable noises. He sounds unfocused, and for providing a rap backbeat, you can't have that. John Otto/Brad Wilk he is not. I was not surprised to hear that the band lacks a bass player. The continuously light riffs was a dead giveaway.<br />Their lyrics are repetitive, dealing with loneliness and frustration, but no geniune anger. Their penchant for not resorting to language is impressive, but aside from &quot;Papercut&quot; and perhaps &quot;Crawling,&quot; or &quot;Pushing Me Away,&quot; there is little lyrical pizazz. Coupled with the tired riffs and boring raps/whiny singing, it really did get old fast.<br />For what it is, it's pretty good. It sure beats the whiny, vulgar, sludge of KoRn, and is much more in depth and substantial than Drowning Pool or old Saliva. It isn't original(311 did this while these guys were in high school), and other bands are doing better rap-rock outfits. As for nu-metal, metal this is not, so don't call this nu-metal. <br />For something more worthwhile, check out Darwin's Waiting Room or (hed) p.e. If the swearing bothers you, listen to P.O.D. instead. All are more captivating, although this isn't bad by any means...at first.<br />If you're sick of rap-metal(which seems to be the trend now--dissing nu-metal...whatever), check out Pantera or Iron Maiden.
0805047905|5.0|My little boy is 13 months old and has loved this book since he was 5 months old.  We read it over and over again.  He loves the pictures and he can't wait to see which animal is on the next page.  He also likes several of Eric Carle's other books.  But, he absolutely loves this one.  If you are expecting a baby or know someone that is, you won't go wrong with this book.  This is definitely a book that our family cannot live without.
B000002MJC|5.0|SOFAD is the final 5 star effort from DM. It is unfair to expect a Violator 2... many fans expected just that. SOFAD is so much more than a sequel to their most popular album to date.<br />Walking in My Shoes and In Your Room are right up there with the greatest songs ever released by DM. Both songs are hypnotic and multi layered and should appeal to anyone who wore out their copies of Violator. Both songs build to a massive crescendo... wonderful productions!<br />There is a backlash to this album because of the introduction to actual acoustic instruments (Drums and Guitar) but that is unfair. None of these instruments dominate the songs... only add an additional layer to them. Others have correctly worried that the loss of Alan Wild would hurt the band. Listening to the albums that follow this final DM classic, I would have to agree that there may be some truth in that. While the following albums were by no means terrible.. SOFAD can be viewed as a final view of a band before they changed directions.
0446608955|1.0|I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, &quot;romance lite&quot; books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this vapid fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it. We can do better than this, American readers!
B00005MP58|3.0|I love Jane Austen adaptations, and this is one of my absolute favorite ones, so you can imagine my extreme disappointment when the DVD was of such poor quality. The colors was poor, the contrast off. Blacks were so dark that there were no highlights and the lights were washed out and faded. I've seen this movie dozens of times and the rotten quality was so distracting. Even adjusting my television set did not help make this poor production watchable. <br />Boo-hiss to A&amp;E for not producing a better DVD (and from what I've seen from other online reviews of this and other A&amp;E productions, I am not alone in my feelings). Be very careful when buying any A&amp;E DVD. Stick to the VHS or tape it off of the television.
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM is/was the best, Tom, Brad, Tim, and Zach were some bad a** guys. This music is on fire, without a doubt some of the most blood pumpin' wake you up music you'll ever hear. Buy this album asap.
B00003CXXM|1.0|of time...so much potential...wasted.  This is one stupid movie.  The story is not believable at all, if you can even call it a story as most of the film it doesn't even make sense.  It could have been really good, but it is just dumb entertainment for dumb gullable people.  Rating should be NO stars.
B000062YAY|4.0|I think everyone agrees that live albums aren't that great but this is THE exception.I think that the songs have more energy on this album than the studio versions and Dave Lombardo is at his very best on these recordings.This material is from Slayers best period and the music selection is top notch.No ballads here just the heaviest metal of its era.If you love really heavy metal,you have to own this 2cd set.Buy it-IF YOU DARE!!!
B00006RIO7|3.0|This musical turned movie was absolutely incredible.  Catherine Zeta Jones was AMAZING.  Rene Zelleweger was not the best (her dancing was mediocre and singing was a little better than her dancing).  Overall though, this was a awesome movie.  It definately will become one of my new favorites.  The soundtrack, however, is less than to be desired.  The orchestra and singers seem to lack the much needed energy that drives the music.  Though the movie looked and sounded great the soundtrack is kind of dull and boring.  For instance, my favorite song in the movie, Cell Block Tango (not the revised one by Queen Latifah) seemed to have no energy what so ever.  The whole soundtrack seems dull in comparison to the glamorously exciting movie.  My advice to you: buy the Broadway version.  It is much better and has songs that were cut out of the movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|I see there are many many reviews for this film, and Ive only seen it once but I was totally blown away by it, and I would urge anyone and everyone to give this movie a try. Subtitles can ..., I know, but this movie is so good it makes up for them. I hope I don't reveal too much of the film with this review, either, so if you haven't watched it, why are you reading this, go and get it!<br />For those still reading, the first thing I noticed was the interesting cinematography, from the sped up shot of Amelie's mother's gestation (which was odd but cool), and the shots of our heroine's Montmarte (I think) environment. The film presents interesting camera angles, which work well with the suspense element, as well as showing the conflicting emotions presented throughout the film. Amelie's world is made up of vibrant colors, which fit snugly with her bubbly personality, and provide a nice contrast when she dresses in dark colors and since she has dark hair. Speaking of Amelie...<br />Audrey Tautou, never heard of her before, but I instantly fell in love with her after watching this film. The writers and directors did an excellent job of creating her character, with her heart melting shyness, intruging alone time, and her elaborate strategies, but I think the actress stole the show hands down. She did a flawless job of portraying her character, has that sweet little girl voice, and is so cute (pranking the phone repair people, in the theater, returning the book to the porn shop, the list goes on...) that I cant help myself. The other characters were definitely secondary, as many seemed one dimensional even though they had different emotions, but they are all well acted and each have their own unique placement in Amelie's life and times.<br />This movie had an uncanny ability to totally draw me in. I missed I think 2 phone calls while watching it, and totally lost track of time. I was cheering for Amelie during her two excursions, and vocalized my angst and sorrow when they didn't work out, much to the bewilderment of my family, who was home at the same time but not watching the film. With that said, you can probably imagine my reaction at the end. <br />I would rank this movie somewhere in my top 10 of all time, and it's the first real 'feel good' movie that really made me feel good for more than an hour after its conclusion. Everyone at my school and my work has been told to watch it, and now I am telling you to, as well. It's lovely, a truly astonishing piece of film. You will not be disappointed.
0316666343|2.0|Yes it starts well. Unfortunatly it slowly declines into mediocraty .  The premis of a murder victim as first person voice is great but it should have remained a novella or short story instead of the book it became.
B000002L5I|2.0|I used to play LEDBETTER HEIGHTS and TROUBLE IS quite regularly. Both are pleasent forrays into the blues without adding anything<BR>new, but at his age their seemed to be a lot of potential. Now I had the misfortune of having seen him live and both his CD's now reside in someone elses collection. What a fraud! KWS has obviously learned 4 or maybe even 5 SRV licks and riffs and alternates using them and the combination in which he plays them<BR>within each song. He is young good looking and will have a solid<BR>following among the same crowd that listens to the BACK STREET BOYS. He is no musician, he is a pin up. The same teeny boppers that were screeching at his concert will no doubt tell you he is the best guitarist on the planet. If you have no comparisons and havn't heard the music that he so dilligently copies you might well be impressed. Having seen SRV - TROWER - BECK - SANTANA - MORSE - CAIN - ERIC - BB - ALBERT COLLINS and many more I know what I'm talking about. Sad thing is I don't think there is any potential and he will do his SRV clone act as long as it sells.
B000007WNN|5.0|Electric represents a welcome departure from the usual over-produced, effects-laden Cult style to a world devoid of wishy-washy effects and filled with Marshall stacks cranked to 10.  Rock fans must have been blown away in 1987 when this album was released, as it defied the trend of sound excess prevalent in the 80's.  On Electric, Ian Astbury's vocals cut to the bone while Billy Duffy's guitars remain in your face for the entire album.<br />Rick Rubin's (producer) fondness for AC/DC is evident on tracks such as \\"Lil' Devil\\" (i.e. \\"Who Made Who\\"), \\"Aphrodisiac Jacket\\" (i.e. \\"Night Prowler\\"), and \\"King Contrary Man\\" (could have been on any AC/DC album).  In fact, at some points during the album Duffy could easily be mistaken for Angus Young.<br />My three favorite tracks on the album - in order of preference - are \\"King Contrary Man\\", \\"Peace Dog\\", and \\"Outlaw\\".  \\"King Contrary Man\\" is probably the hardest rocking song on this album, though \\"Born To Be Wild\\" gives it a run for its money.  I listened to this track for at least an hour, repeating it several times!  The lyrics contain a nod to Mississippi Delta blues legend Robert Johnson (\\"Down at the crossroads temptin' fate / Said yeah you can take my soul\\")<br />\\"Peace Dog\\" comes in a close second, featuring an excellent solo backed by a headbanging rhythm and vocal section.  A notable line from the lyrics is \\"B-five-two baby, way up in the sky / Come drop your lovin' on me child\\".<br />Finally, \\"Outlaw\\" fades in with a fast, driving riff that will infect your mind for days to come.  Duffy's searing solo on this track is memorable.<br />Though some tracks are radio-friendly (\\"Wild Flower\\", and the Stones-esque \\"Love Removal Machine\\") they have just enough edge to keep hardcore hard rock fans from pressing fast-forward.  While I generally dislike cover songs, \\"Born To Be Wild\\" on Electric is about as nasty and grinding as I've ever heard it played, and it pays homage to Steppenwolf.<br />On an interesting side note, the 1997 CD remaster includes detailed liner notes - filled with all the lyrics, discography specific to Electric, and a biographical article by Pat Gilbert.<br />I rate the overall album five stars because every track is strong; none deserve to be skipped.  If you like to play it loud, live for crunching riffs, or like AC/DC - buy this album NOW.
B000089CKH|5.0|From the High/Low disc through their court troubles with The Proximity Effect, and finally their latest release, Nada Surf have truly matured as musicians and songwriters.  This is not to say that they needed to; I am still a huge fan of their firts album, but they have, and they are making really great music now.  Let Go is a heavily melodic album with the same melancholy outlook they have always had.  Lyrics like &quot;Try another me and I will try another you&quot; from Treading Water really capture the essence of &quot;the struggle&quot; of late adolescence and early adulthood that the band has always focused on.  Order it now, though, because it's absolutely perfect for a cold, snowy night.
B000089CKH|5.0|okay, to anyone who wont listen to nada surf because they didnt like &quot;popular&quot;, please start listening.<br />This album is sheer genius.  They have really nailed down their songwriting.  There are a few pop rocker tracks on the album, but there are also many slower, beautiful tracks.  &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; is especially great, listening to Bob Dylan while walking in the NYC rain.  &quot;Killian's Red,&quot; and &quot;Paper Boats&quot; are my personal favorites.  But its hard to pick a favorite as the entire album is just perfect.  If you loke alot of indie rock, this is a must have.  Mojo, the only mag i really trust, set this album in the top 50 of 2002 (European release was last September).  It is a REALLY BEAUTIFUL ALBUM.  Anyone still comparing them to being a &quot;Son of Weezer&quot; really has to stop now.  Unlike Weezer, Nada Surf has grown and moved well beyond the Top 40 persona they once had.  If you actually listened to either of their first two albums then you know that that song was really kind of the weakest track they had.  Most MTVheads didnt even notice that the song was a sarcastic comment on high school life.  Anyway buy this album.  You will be pleased.

Let Go is a heavily melodic album with the same melancholy outlook they have always had.  Lyrics like &quot;Try another me and I will try another you&quot; from Treading Water really capture the essence of &quot;the struggle&quot; of late adolescence and early adulthood that the band has always focused on.  Order it now, though, because it's absolutely perfect for a cold, snowy night.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Don't get me wrong...the redux version of this classic movies is probably the deffinition of what DVD quality should be. I mean this movie was released in 1978 and the piture and sound is amazing. The quality matches up to the movies released in 2003. The one problem is the added scenes are a bit too much. Most of the scenes are pointless and are really not necessary. For example, The French Plantaton scene, Cleans funeral, and a 20 minute conversation between Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen. I would of gave this movie 5 stars if these scenes were taken out. Overall this is a good Vietnam war movie. The cast is great and the acting is well done.

B00005JK8K|1.0|This movie will appeal to someone who enjoys seeing staged explosions, and anyone without a military background who enjoys fantasizing about combat.  You can be sure that no one with even rudimentary knowledge of history or WWII had anything to do with this production.<br />The dialogue is laughable. At one point, Nicholas Cage, who portays a buck sergeant, talks about losing men under his command. The trouble is, junior noncommissioned officers do not command by virtue of rank.  That's common knowledge among anyone who ever served in the armed forces.<br />The battle scenes are ludicrous, with no historical or technical accuracy whatsoever. To boot, the main Navajo character comes cross as some sort of politically correct rube, sort of a cross between Forrest Gump and Tonto.<br />This movie is truly a hateful experience, and hopefully will be soon forgotten. Maybe sometime in the future, a good film will be made to commemorate these brave native Americans sans the comic-book visuals and dialogue.
B000065U1N|5.0|The subtitle of Mark Bowden's best selling book is\\" \\"A Story of Modern War.\\"  The movie version, though limited in scope when compared to the book, does Bowden's account justice. For the most part, the film is historically accurate. Black Hawk Down is arguably the best war movie depicting a modern engagement, but are the themes of the film new? Let's take a look.The film's timeless theme is the loss of innocence. Before the mission, the Delta Force men were the hardened combat veterans, while the Ranger Force, though well trained, had yet to experience their baptism of fire. By the closing scenes, however, the Rangers had earned the respect of their more covert elite comrades, and all involved realised their lives would be forever changed by their ordeal.Like the protagonist of Steven Crane ( The Red Badge of Courage) and Erich Maria Remarque (All Quiet of the Western Front), soldiers have always agonized over how they will perform in battle. More precisely, how they will overcome their fear. For the young Rangers about to jump into utter chaos in Mogadishu in October 1993, these trepidations were all too real.The theme of camaraderie resonates throughout the film. This theme is neither new to the genre of war films, nor to the experience of military service. What makes a soldier advance under a hail of weathering enemy bullets? What makes a soldier continue to face death or possible mutilation to save  wounded comrades? As the Delta sergeant relates: \\"It's all about the guy next to you...no one else can understand that.\\" After the two Black Hawks went down, the surgical insertion had changed to a rescue mission; \\"no one gets left behind.\\"  There are always casualties in battle. Some of those who go out do not return. But no training can prepare those who survive to accept the loss of those who did not. The film conveys this emotion marvelously, in spite of the hardened Delta sergeant who grabs a quick bite and ventures out again, alone.The film is about responsibility more than duty. No soldier best illustrates this virtue better than a sergeant. The timeless NCO who provides the bridge between those who issue orders and those expected to carry them out. Sgt. Matt Eversmann undergoes a transformation from idealist to combat veteran. Not only does he have a job to perform, he also strives to get his men back alive. How he performs his job and deals with its consequences is a true testament to this young man's spirit. Note the list of men killed before the closing credits, most of those who died were sergeants. Out there in the thick of the action, caring for the welfare of their men, we always lose so many fine sergeants!The concerns other reviewers had with character development are warranted. I had the same criticism when I saw the movie in the theater. When experiencing their transformation from ordinary fun loving kids to battle hardened veterans, it is difficult to recall the \\"before\\" juxtaposed with the \\"after.\\" This  can be easily overcome with a second or third viewing of the DVD.

B00005JLKN|5.0|I must say, \\"What a major improvement over Silence of the Lambs.\\" As someone who feels \\"Lambs\\" is one of the most overhyped and painfully overrated films of all time, and Hannibal is just plain terrible, I am glad to admit that I absolutely LOVED Brett Rhatner's film adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel, \\"Red Dragon, a true edge-of-the-seat psychological thriller. This is a smartly crafted and well-paced thriller with brilliantly powerful peformances by the superb all-star cast. There is never a dull moment--this one is fueled by adrenaline from the engrossing start to the pulse-pounding finale. Anthony Hopkins, being one of the only redeeming qualities in \\"Lambs,\\" is in top form here, giving yet another chilling performance. Edward Norton is wonderful as William Graham, who, wounded by Lecter years before, has been asked to request his help in finding a deadly killer called \\"The Tooth Fairy,\\" a bone-chilling performance by Ralph Fiennes. The supporting cast has Phillip Seymour Hoffman in another great performance as a greedy tabloid reporter, the beautiful Emily Watson as \\"The Tooth Fairy\\"'s love interest, and Mary Louise Parker as Graham's wife. This is a change in form for comedy director Brett Rhatner (Rush Hour) and he does a wonderful job with the material. I was pleasantly surprised by Red Dragon and strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a thriller that actually thrills. This is a wonderful film!!!
0316548189|5.0|Using a rich gift for storytelling obviously influenced by a culture which values oral tradition, Mandela brilliantly and dramatically relates a life struggle that is still very much a work in progress.<br />Inspired by the previous peacefull revolutions in India and The American South, Mandela sought to forge a brave new world built on justice tempered with grace and foregiveness. Mandela deftly avoids simply demonizing the brutal white doctrines that oppressed Blacks for years. He also lays plenty of responsibility on the doorstep of the years of tribal hatred and ethnic strife that has plagued his people for centuries. His brave effort to bridge years of hatred, war and oppression makes for mandatory reading for all people regardless of race or nationality as it is a fight we all find ourselves steeped.<br />This is not to suggest that this book makes for a dry read. Quite the opposite. Mandela is a born leader and his rich use of language makes his journey all the more personal and, therefore all the more universal. A powerful story for all to read.
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston gives a near flawless performance in this bleak, depressing, and wonderful movie, a seductive tale of love and loneliness. Justine (Jennifer Aniston) has always been THE GOOD GIRL. Thirty years old and working in a Texas discount store, she is dissatisfied with her routine life and disgusted by her lazy, pot-smoking husband (John C. Reilly in another perfect performance). Her life is nearly at a standstill, until she suddenly notices Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal, wonderful once again) a few cash registers away. He is young and seemingly as lonely as she is, and together the two forge a passionate connection destined to shatter everything Justine stands for. As Justine struggles to cover up her affair, she unwantingly makes things much worse for herself.<br />The movie is a dark comedy about false dreams and lost illusions -- and, thanks to a fine cast and a smart script, it's an effective one, working on plenty of different levels. Director Miguel Arteta and writer-actor Mike White, the clever duo behind \\"Chuck & Buck,\\" make Justine an anti-heroine at the same time they make fun of her and her world. They make Wasteland, Texas, the quintessential town to escape -- except that in this film, the characters seemingly can't.<br />This is a fine movie, and the perfect role for Aniston. She has certainly opened a lot of eyes and garnered much deserved attention because of this film. The film was slow moving, sometimes excruciatingly, but the running time is fine, therefore it doesn't seem absolutely unbearable. The performances alone, especially that of Aniston, are worth checking out the film for. It's an unusual film, full of depressed, suicidal, and psychotic characters, and I think that's what I loved about it. This is far from conventional for Aniston and I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Not for all tastes, but definitely worth seeing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I personally like music off many different genres but have to admit that I've never been a big fan of jazz or piano.  This album has broadened my tastes in music.<BR>I first discovered Norah Jones through her video.  I remember thinking &quot;WOW! this is totally different from what they usually air on MTV or VH1&quot;.  Her voice caught my attention immediately and literally made me stop in my tracks.  It is in not &quot;Flat&quot; or &quot;Boring&quot; as a couple other reviews have said.  She has a rich, soulful, romantic quality that just lures you in and holds you there.  Her musical training is evident and is a nice change from the other stuff that's on the charts.  <br />This album is not high energy, but who wants high energy all the time anyway?  Great Saturday evening at home music.  I love it and am looking forward to her next album very very much.
0316666343|2.0|Simply stated, this book is a chore to read. I am 3/4 of the way through, however every page is a struggle. After a pretty strong opening chapter, the book takes a nose dive into the depths of boredom and drudgery. The narrator, 15-year-old Susie Salmon, speaks in a voice well beyond her years with not much personality. The other characters are not very well developed or likeable. Her grandmother is the only interesting character in the book. I look forward to finishing this and moving on to something a little more worthwhile.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I don't get it. This guys music is so uninspired and uninteresting, yet you can't help but listen to it even if you don't really like it -- This is why it strikes me as just another creation of the top-40 music machine.

B000002AP1|3.0|Okay kiddies, everyone out there is gonna say I'm full of it, but I have a strong hunch that this is what happened on the Raw Power album . . .<br />The band falls to pieces after recording Fun House (the greatest of the Stooges' two albums).  David Bowie meets Iggy through a mutual heroin dealer and gets interested in him for reasons that are probably numerous (fascism, homosexuality, drugs, street credibility, etc, etc...) but are ultimately unimportant.  What is important is that Iggy is broke and strung-out so he allows Bowie's mismanagement team to resurrect his erstwhile career.  First thing David does is convince Iggy to put his name in front of the band's name.  Next thing he does is audition studio musician guitarists to replace Ron Asheton.  Big mistake.  From this point on, the Stooges are no more.<br />The album itself...<br />In the studio, the new band manages to crank-out a few good tunes in spite of Williamson's 'song-crafting' which threatens to rob the album of the primitive energy that made Ron Asheton's Stooges so great.  Furthermore, the production (I'll blame Bowie) sucks. <br />Unlike Fun House which offers track to track brilliance,  Raw Power flounders all over the place.  Although it's dirty and pretty, I can't help feeling that 'Gimme Danger' is Bowie's conscious attempt to get Iggy to replicate the breakthrough success of Alice Cooper's 'I'm Eighteen.'  'Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell,' lacks the musical muscle that the title promises.  And, although I agree with almost everything that a previous reviewer has said about this album, I cannot let him get away with his almost positive assesment of 'Shake Appeal' (perhaps the most laughably bad song on the album).  It sounds like Richard Penniman went into the studio on ketamine to cut a b-side to 'Good Golly, Miss Molly'.  Where the Stooges smoldered with sexy nihilism on 'Dirt', Iggy's new band is just plain boring on 'Penetration.'  'Death Trip' (when placed beside the crescendo and explosion of 'L.A. Blues') ends the Raw Power album with a fade-out and a fizzle.<br />Two small but important things are enough to put this album in the 3 star category.  It's dark and its got 'Search and Destroy' on it.  However, the final analysis indicates that by the time Raw Power was recorded, the Stooges were no more and Iggy Pop's crucial impact on rock'n'roll (that we should all extend equally to the rest of the original Stooges) was effectively over.  Sorry for tearing down your rock idols...
B00000255X|5.0|I'm a huge Dylan fan and have held off on this album for some time.  I finally broke down and bought it and it is hands down one of his best albums.  The songs don't seem to flow like a normal Dylan album but songs like Isis and One More Cup.. are some of his best IMO.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00006M183|5.0|First of all, I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, and in my eyes, they have never made a bad album.  Ten will always be classic, Vs. wasn't the best but is great in concerts, Vitalogy was a dark, thought provoking album, No Code is it's own masterpiece, Yield yielded to nothing, envoking endless possibilities, and Binaural, while letting me see the stars, also left more to be desired.  Riot Act is everything thing that I'm come to love about Pearl Jam.  It confronts world and social issues, love, loss and anything in between.  From the opening chords of Can't Keep to the Closing chords of All or None this album has it all.  My personal favorites are Save You, LBC, Cropduster, Ghost, You Are, Green Disease, and Arc.  So, I would definitly suggest trying this album out.  You'll quickly understand how Pearl Jam has been around for over 10 years and can still fill any venue in the world.  Viva la vinyl!! 10C
B0000640VN|2.0|That's what a friend of mine told me after we both finished watching this cute, dumb movie that tries to combine romance and time travel in an effort to say that all modern woman really needs is to be courted or some such nonsense.<br />Romantic-comedy staple Meg Ryan plays a driven 20th century ad exec, who manages to be successful despite her flaky, Meg Ryan-esque nature and constantly tousled hairdo. I used to like Meg Ryan, back when she did the still-good films \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" or \\"Sleepless in Seattle,\\" but now she annoys the heck out of me. It feels like she's phoning in her performance. I wish she'd do a different kind of movie. Though I know she's played against type before, it's never in anything that I've wanted to watch. (The last time I saw her play someone not cutesy was back in \\"DOA,\\" I think.) She's getting, dare I say it, too old to play this part well. She needs to pass the baton on to the next generation of actresses, like Sandra Bullock (who's starting to do too many of these movies herself). Meg, for the love of God, play some teenager's mother in your next film. Please.<br />Hugh Jackman's absolutely charming as Leopold, a 19th century New York nobleman about to reluctantly choose his bride when he gets sucked into the 20th Century.

The entire film is throwaway fluff.
B00005JL78|3.0|About the only thing about &quot;Minority Report&quot; that is original is the spiffy effects.  Underneath it all, however, is an oft-used plotline:  Our rugged, honest hero is being set up for a crime he didn't commit (or, in this case, didn't commit YET), and he must go on the run and find out who is framing him and why.  Naturally, as the tried and true formula goes, his betrayer is someone close to him.  And it shouldn't be that hard to figure out the real villain once you've read the cast list or been introduced to the major players in the film.<br />It's just the same meal with a different flavor.<br />And again, we have Spielberg pouring oodles of time and resources into another whiz-bang effects movie and plenty of extras for a DVD release.  So why can't he devote that kind of time and energy to getting the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy to your local store shelves in a more timely manner?<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; really only impresses visually instead of emotionally.  Even if you get caught up in the story, you can't help but feel the sense of deja-vu.  If you feel you've seen this movie before, you probably have.  But &quot;Minority Report&quot; just makes it LOOK new.<br />As time goes by, this film probably won't be remembered as anything more than a reasonably big Summer 2002 box office effects extravaganza, another &quot;Ooooh, neat!&quot; movie-going experience.  It will be regarded as a really cool movie for a few more months, perhaps, then the next effects-laden thriller will come along to supplant it.<br />Don't get me wrong:  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is a decent movie, I guess.  But don't be swept away by the Flavor-of-the-Month accolades it is getting.  And after the next big Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg movie has its day in the sun, &quot;Minority Report&quot; will seem as exciting as yesterday's news.<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; makes for a good 5 day rental from your local video store.  Rent it for all the behind-the-scenes goodies.  But if you purchase it for your home library, it will sit there like an old, forgotten impulse purchase before you know it.nes goodies.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen's wonderful novels have been adapted many times over and many recent adaptations have been excellent. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is one of those heartwarming and romantic love stories that you'll want to revisit again and again.<br />This is a story of Anne Eliott, second daughter to a debt-ridden baronet.  She fell in love with the dashing and handsome Frederick Wentworth at age 19 but was persuaded to break the engagement because of his limited prospects.  She is, after all, from a noble family while he has a far humbler background.<br />9 years later, Anne is still unmarried and considered a spinster at age 28.  A visit to her younger sister Mary puts her in the path of Frederick - now a successful navy captain.  She discovers that she is still in love with him but he appears civil but cold (not having forgiven her for breaking his heart). <br />You'll have to watch the movie to find out how it all turns out but I guarantee that you will find this a thoroughly romantic and enjoyable period piece.  The acting is topnotch and it has the high production values that you would find in an A&amp;E or BBC production. If you've read the book, you will find that this adaptation is very faithful to its source.<br />I would also recommend &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; (Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet), &quot;Emma&quot; (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the fantastic &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth) to round out a great selection of Jane Austen films. Be sure to check out &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; (Justine Waddell, Keely Hawes) for another splendid romantic adaptation (this time from Mrs. Gaskell's early Victorian novel).
0802130208|5.0|The late John Kennedy Toole penned a veritably irrefutable masterpiece in the ingenious A Confederacy of Dunces.  Although inestimably depressing that he committed suicide due to Simon Schuster's publication refusal, Toole and his incomparable genius live on vicariously through this resounding work of undeniable merit.<br />I find it seemingly impossible and self-defeating to sum up this great work so as not to be redundant or spoil it for others.  Suffice it to say, I tore through this book in two days and reveled in its farcical and satirical ingenuity as I laughed out loud early and often, as it were, that I actively yearned for it not to come to a close.  The anachronistic, bombastic, and verbose rhetoric of our intrepid & endearing protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, riotously pervades A Confederacy of Dunces and makes for the most incredibly vital and overtly comical character I have encountered since Shakespeare's Falstaff himself in Henrvy IV I&II.  John Kennedy Toole's amazingly vivid characterization and unparalleled cynicism emanate throughout this bona fide tour de force with an unmistakably resonant subtlety.  As the irrepressible Ignatius would note, it would be absolutely shameless effrontery and an utterly unspeakable abomination for A Confederacy of Dunces NOT to be mentioned among the top 10 American novels of all-time - this goes without saying.  5 Shining Stars!<br />\\"I dust a bit...in addition, I am at the moment writing a lengthy indictment against our century.

B000002H6C|4.0|Of all Metallica albums, this is the one album which I just can't seem to get my head around....sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it.<BR>                    All the songs are complexely over-arranged and it takes about ten listens at least to figure out what each song sounds like. Still, this album is extremely heavy with metallica giving us their fatest sound here than on any other album. Sometimes when I listen to this album I am practically screaming at the stereo '' Jesus christ stop all this 'I can fit ten riffs into one song' and play the bloody song!'' Sometimes I think they are going backwards on these songs. This definitly is regarded as a dissapointing follow-up to the invincible ''Master of puppets'' and Cliff Burton's unmistakable basslines are absent leaving the album in many ways quite dull and joyless. The band knew what they were doing wrong on this album and the following 'Black' album couldn't be more the opposite to this one.<BR>                             However, They're is an undoubted touch of class about Metallica and this album can hardley be called just average just average by Metallica's standards.The best songs are the epical 'one' and 'harverster of sorrow'. One particular point to note on this album is that Lars Ulrich gives his best performance on drums than on any other Metallica album.Despite divided opinions on this album, it is still essential for any Metallica fan.
B0000024K1|5.0|Public Enemy's _It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back_ Is the music equivelent to getting punched in the face. Every song on this album is classic. Chick D's rhymes are so powerful that you just sit back and go \\"wow, what was that\\" add to that Flavor Flav's clowning and The Bomb Squads revolutionary production. The result is a landmark album not just in Rap/Hip-Hop but in all of music.
B000023VR6|4.0|Dr. Dre was going through a slump when he left Death Row in 1996. His album, The Aftermath, featuring talent from his new label of the same name, was a critical disappointment, his exec-produced album The Firm (with Nas, Foxy Brown, etc.) was considered a flop, and every other song produced by him afterwards didn't catch fire (remember Dre and LL Cool J's \\"Zoom\\", anyone?). But in 1999, when hip-hop was all about Jay-Z, DMX and Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dogg (whose career was also in a slump when Dre left) rocked on a Dre-produced song called \\"B Please\\" with Xzibit. The beat was addictive and it was a sign of things to come. Aside from signing Eminem and helping him make history, the Doctor teamed with Snoop again later that year for the lovely song, \\"Still D.R.E.\\" and it was then official. Dr. Dre was back.<br />This album, Dr. Dre 2001, helped hip-hop put the focus on the West again. With the exception of Tha Liks and The Pharcyde, I've never heard of any West Coast production deviating from George Clinton and Roger Troutman samples until this album. Peep the dope use of the strings in \\"Still D.R.E.\\", \\"Forgot About Dre\\" (with Eminem), and \\"The Message\\" (a tribute featuring Rell and Mary J. Blige, co-produced by Lord Finesse).<br />With help from Mel-Man, Dre's production taught other producers how to just let the beat ride and not worry about hi-hats or scratches. Songs like \\"Some L.A. N's\\" and \\"Xxplosive\\" are critically acclaimed for its simplicity, just a beat a bassline. By the way, the latter was supposed to be a Dre solo called \\"Way I Be Pimpin'\\", but that version was cut when Dre and Royce the 5'9\\" (who wrote the lyrics to that song) got into some beef. But that's okay because Hittman, Kurupt, Nate Dogg and Sixx-Two handle the song just fine.<br />Speaking of lyrics, Dre was never the tightest emcee in the world, and the dope lines that he say are usually ghost-written, but all of the guest rappers on here make up for that with award-winning performances. Snoop never sounded better on Dre's beats (well, duh), Xzibit made more people take notice of him on songs such as \\"What's the Difference\\", and for anyone who liked Eminem before this album, his performance on the aforementioned song didn't change their opinion. There are lots of newcomers like Ms. Roq, Knoc-Turn'al, Time Bomb and most notably, Hittman, who appears more times than Dre himself (maybe Hitt knew in advance that his album wouldn't drop anytime soon, what with working with Dre?).<br />It's hard to pick the best song, but the runners-up are \\"B.N.'s\\", \\"Some L.A. N's\\" with MC Ren speaking in the intro (why oh why didn't he kick a verse??), \\"Xxplosive\\", and \\"What's the Difference\\". Although this isn't a flawless album (\\"Bang Bang\\" and \\"Let's Get High\\" sound too 1993-ish), the rest of the songs reach classic status, making 2001 a very enjoyable album.

I really like it.<br />&quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; - I hated it when I first heard it, but listening to the lyrics makes it a little better, not my favorite, but it's ok.<br />&quot;Too much to ask&quot; - Really good lyrics, I just don't like the way it's sung I guess.<br />I think all of her song's have really good lyrics, I'm impressed that a 17-year-old wrote all of this, it's very good.  I'd say buy it. Oh and I love the way the lyrics are written, very clever.
B000000W5L|5.0|This album defines the cliche' \\"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\\". Recorded in the basement of Keith Richards' house in France, it has a shoddy production and care-free arrangements. Just as it was intended. Sounds like a bunch of friends got together and turned on the tape recorder. Overdubs at the kitchen table. People talking in the background. A completely honest album. Seering rockers (\\"Rocks Off, All Down The Line); Gospel-tinged (\\"Shine A Light\\"); R&B (\\"Tumblin' Dice). Great acoustic country campfire numbers (\\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Torn & Frayed\\"). And of course the signature Keith with \\"Happy\\". A-Z, dirty rock music the way God planned it. 18 beautiful tracks. Highly, highly underrated album. Stones at their best. All the myths are lived through this one release.
B00005OAIE|4.0|The way this guy sings is amazing. The songs are catchy and have meaning to them. My favorite tracks are &quot;why Georgia&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot;, and &quot;My stupid mouth&quot;.
B000002KB8|4.0|Until recently I always thought this was a devil worship album and have had the opinion that Black Sabbath was into the occult.  Last week I finally listened to this album quite closely and the album isn't about devil worship at all but how the devil deceives and eats up people if they aren't careful.  I am making my own comparison between this album and Master of Reality which should turn out just fine.  All in all, the album may be a bit repetitive, but it is a very good starter.  Unfortunately, the US release omitted the song Evil Woman from the album but is included on the UK release.  This is a very good rock song and would have been a hit had it been included on the US release and released as a single.  Sabbath has made a good start with this one leading to other masterpieces like Master of Reality, Volume 4, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, all good albums indeed.
B00005JKZT|5.0|It only isn't better than the first, but it is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Here's why:<br />1.Gollum. He was so realistic I sometimes forgot that he was just a CG-rendered image. The audience could both feel for him and take him seriously as an actual character.<br />2.Treebeard. Another good looking CGI character. Just what I imagined when I was reading the book.<br />3.The warg attack. Although it wasn't in the book, it provided some nice action when the movie was lagging.<br />4.The Battle of Helm's Deep. Peter Jackson devoted the last half hour of the movie to the greatest battle sequence ever seen (at least until film #3). Great visual effects used here, as well.<BR>Absolutely astonishing.<br />So what if there are changes? I thought many were right on. Stop picking the movie apart to find flaws and enjoy it. Book and film are at opposite ends of the media spectrum. In all, this is a must-see.
B000002KE2|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Black Sabbath album.  This is one kick [hiney] album and it shows Sabbath still going strong.  Ozzy belts it out and Mr. Iommi's guitar playing is out of this world.  It would be extremely hard to pick a favorite track from this LP but if I had to it would be Wheels Of Confusion.  The instrumental portion of this track really kicks!!!!  This album is a must for any Black Sabbath fan.  If you're a fan and don't have this album, you don't know what you're missing!
B00005YU1O|5.0|Many people complain that the philosophy espoused in this film is sophomoric and amaturish. Chances are those people never had the insight to see past the words in their philosophy 101 textbook and grasp the truth behind them. They have responded the same way to this film. Rather than trying to seek out the beauty and truth contained in this truly remarkable film, the negative reviewers have taken the opportunity to spit venom at something that disturbes and frightens them.<BR> To me, the whole concept behind &quot;Waking Life&quot; is that logic and reason are not enough. They can be useful tools for dealing with everyday mundane problems and situations, but human beings need more. We have naturally been provided with more in that we have the ability to dream, to meditate, to trip, to wonder, ect. All of these activities put us in a state of mind in which logic and reason have no place, and seem rather silly and pointless. Sadly, these states of mind have been all but written off by modern western culture, a culture that most westerners accept without question. But deep inside the unconcious of the jaded 16-year old who impulsively flips through cable channels to see who J-Lo's latest crush is, something is screaming out for help. It's that illogical, irrational side of a person that longs to be bathed in childlike wonder. &quot;Waking Life&quot; shows us that, actually, we need to not only dream, but to acknowlage that our dreams are real in order to truly wake up.<BR> If you have thoughts similar to these, and feel that everyone else's soul is dead except yours, watch this film, and you will feel better.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver exposes the dark side of trying to create a perfect world.  On the bright side, everyone is harmonious and obedient, there is no poverty and no want or need, but with light, there's shadow.  The main character Jonas has led a sheltered life of ease.  Upon his twelfth birthday he is assigned his job that he will do for the rest of his life as everyone else will, he becomes \\"The Receiver of Memories\\".  The role is one of high honor and Jonas accepts it with a twinge of sadness but with pride.  As he trains for his new role in the community he begins to learn of the horrors of human history and the present.  His perspective on the world is forever altered. He must decide his fate, but is it the right one?<BR>  This book is fantastic and I'm very glad I spent the time to read it.  The Giver offers a view into what would go wrong if one tried to create a utopian society.   Lois Lowry does a wonderful job of creating a world that the reader feels involved in.  She sets up contrasts and foil that keep a reader enthralled in the story.  The Giver is definitely a book that everyone should add to their library.
B0000039QA|5.0|I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW TO PAY CHRISTOPHER WALLACE THE TRIBUTE HE REALLY DESERVES. I WAS JUST GLANCING OVER THE REVIEWS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HIS DOUBLE CD CLASSIC. I WAS PERSONALLY DISGUSTED AT THE REVIEWS HE WAS GIVEN. THE REASON FOR THIS IS, HE WAS THE GREATEST. AS AN ARTIST HE ENTWINED ALL THE ATTRIBUTES THAT MAKE OTHER HIP HOP ARTIST GREAT. EVERY ESSENCE OF HIP HOP THAT MADE RAKIM THE BEST LYRISTS, SLICK RICK THE BEST STORY TELLER, NAS THE BEST POET, AND PAC THE MOST PASSIONATE. BIGGIE PUT ALL OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES INTO ONE UNBELIEVABLE ARTIST. HE PAINTED THE PORTRAIT OF THE GREATEST IN HIMSELF. HIS ONLY TWO ALBUMS, LEAVING OUT THE FORGERY RELEASED AS HIS THIRD LP, SHOWED ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIP HOP COMMUNITY. EVERY SONG ON LIFE AFTER DEATH IS HOT ENOUGH TO SEND ANOTHER ARTIST PLATINUM. NEVER HAS PAC BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT BIG DID ON THIS ALBUM AND READY TO DIE. WHAT BIG DID IS CREATE A STRONG, UNBEATABLE, AND UNDEFEATABLE ALBUM COMPLETE THROUGH, BEGINNING TO END. <br />THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME= NO.TO.RI.O.US YOU JUST LAY DOWN SLOW
B000002L68|5.0|...while the music sounds great, the sound mastering is not that good. Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remaster this album with bonus tracks. Here's what should be:<br />1.
